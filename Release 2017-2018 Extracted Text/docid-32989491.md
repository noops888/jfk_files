Taped by television crews, the attack

on Reagan was later witnessed by mil-

lions-the second time in a generation

that the nation was stunned by the

sight of a President shot in the streets

during a public appearance.

But by the end of the week, doctors

reported Reagan was in "satisfactory"

condition and was expected to recover

speedily, barring unexpected complica-

tions such as bleeding or infection.

The 70-year-old Reagan, by all ac-

counts, exhibited the recuperative

powers of a much younger man. ASSO-

ciates added that he also laid to rest

lingering concerns that he was too old

The day after the shooting, on March

31, the GOP-dominated Senate beat

back half a dozen attempts to soften

the President's budget cuts. While the

outcome was assured even before the

attack, the Republicans picked up sur-

prising Democratic support.

"There will be a positive reaction in

Congress," predicted Max Frieders-

dorf, Reagan's chief lobbyist. "Any time

a leader is harmed in any way, there is

always a natural sympathy. It will en-

Later there were sessions with labor

leaders, cabinet officers, members of

Congress and, finally, talks with envoys

from Poland and Turkey.

Once the President leaves the hospi-

tal, Bush and others are believed likely

to retain control over many of the du-

dividends if his boss decides against

with helping defuse public panic.

Everything possible was done to de-

the impression of a White House func-

tioning smoothly and calmly.

No pictures of Reagan were allowed

until he could present a relatively robust

When the Secret Service men no-

however, for allowing the President to

his injury.

9 Others

Who faced

ASSaSSins

If Ronald Reagan's medical prognosis

is correct, he will be the first sitting

President to survive a gunshot wound.

Nine of the 38 Presidents before him

were attacked by armed assailants. Four

Presidents died. For a look at earlier as-

sassination attempts and the assailants:

Andrew Jackson: Richard Lawrence, a psychotic who

thought himself King Richard IlI of England, aimed two

pistols at Jackson in the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 30,

1835. Both pistols misfired, and Jackson was unhurt. Ruled

insane, Lawrence was committed to an asylum for life.

Abraham Lincoln: John Wilkes Booth, an actor who favored

the South in the Civil War, entered an unguarded box at a

Washington theater and shot Lincoln in the head. The

President died the next day, April 15, 1865. Booth was

killed when soldiers attempted to arrest him I1 days later.

James Garfield: As Garfield strolled through a Washington,

D.C., railroad station on July 2, 1881, he was shot by

Charles J. Guiteau, a radical member of the President's own

Republican Party. Garfield died more than two months

later. Guiteau was convicted of murder and hanged.

William McKinley: Leon F. Czolgosz, an anarchist, shot

McKinley in the chest and stomach at the Pan-American

Exposition in Buffalo, N.Y., on Sept. 6, 1901. McKinley died

eight days later. Convicted of murder in a one-day trial,

Czolgosz was electrocuted at an Auburn, N.Y., state prison.

Theodore Roosevelt: John N. Schrank, who claimed he

was instructed by the ghost of McKinley, shot Roosevelt in

the chèst on Oct. 14, 1912, as the ex-President was cam-

paigning for another term. Roosevelt recovered. Schrank

was ruled insane and died in a mental hospital in 1943.

Franklin D. Roosevelt: Giuseppe Zangara, blaming capital-

ists for his stomach pains, fired a pistol at then President-

elect Roosevelt in Miami, Fla., on Feb. 15, 1933. Roosevelt

escaped harm, but Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak was

killed. Zangara was tried and executed within days.

Harry S. Truman: On Nov. 1, 1950, two Puerto Rican na-

tionalists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, tried to

shoot their way into Blair House, Truman's temporary resi-

dence. The President was unharmed. Torresola and a guard

died. Truman commuted Collazo's death sentence.

John F. Kennedy: Rifle fire mortally wounded Kennedy in

a Dallas, Tex., motorcade on Nov. 22, 1963. Lee Harvey

Oswald, a pro-Castro radical, was arrested, but he was later

fatally shot by Jack Ruby, a saloon owner. There is still

dispute over whether Oswald was the lone assassin.

Gerald Ford: On Sept. 5, 1975, in Sacramento, Calif., drug-

cult member Lynette Fromme pointed a pistol at Ford, but

she was disarmed. Seventeen days later in San Francisco,

Sara Jane Moore, a political activist, shot at the President

but missed. Both women are serving prison terms.

It was not an easy night, however.

Concern mounted in the recovery

room. Reagan was breathing with the

help of a respirator, but tests to moni-

tor oxygen in his blood were disturb-

ing. X-rays showed that blood clots

were obstructing his airways.

By 9 p.m.,

doctors decided to per-

form a bronchoscopy—a procedure in

which a fiber-optic instrument is in-

serted in a tube already in the patient's

windpipe so that doctors can locate the

blood clots and remove them.

Slight setback. Reagan was on mor-

phine to relieve the pain. His head was

raised; he was alert and in good humor.

But the attempted bronchoscopy failed

Throughout the night, nurses took

turns removing blood clots through a

tube with a suction device. Fortunate-

ly, Reagan's lungs began to improve.

By 2 a.m., X-rays showed that his lungs

were close to normal, and an hour later

he was taken off the respirator.

At 6:15 a.m., the patient was moved

to the intensive-care unit, jammed

with nurses in yellow uniforms and

banks of dials and TV screens that

monitor vital signs of the very sick.

Why U.S. Lifestyle

Produces Assassins

A new attempt on a President's life raises old questions:

Why do such attempts continue? What will it take to bring them

to a halt? For answers, the magazine went to a noted

psychiatrist and consultant on violent crime.

Q Dr. Menninger, what accounts for

the string of assassination attempts

against national leaders In the last two

decades?

A Every society produces its alienat-

ed persons who try to carry out their

own agenda, but some characteristics

of ours increase the potential risk.

For one thing, more guns are avail-

able than ever before-and these are

the main weapons in assassination as

well as violent crime, of which we have

more than any other Western industri-

alized nation.

We also have a tradition of individual

freedoms-and more resistance to lim-

-• its on those freedoms.

Another thing is affluence. Potential

assassins can easily go to where their

target is. In the John Lennon case, the

alleged assassin flew in from Hawaii.

Q As.a psychlatrist who has been in-

volved in studies of violence and presl-

dential security, how did you react to the

attempt on President Reagan's life?

A My initial response was that I

wasn't surprised-in part, because I've

been reviewing some of the data on

assassinations and, in part, because of

the tenor of the times.

Moreover, this is a President of

strong and forcerul character, who has

expressed his opinions on public issues

that excite emotions and

who is not

viewed as a conciliator. This sets the

stage for making him a lightning rod—

a target for assassination.

Q Is a profile bullding up on persons

who try to carry out assassinations?

A Not a specific profile, but there

are common elements.

Characteristically, assassins tend to

W. Walter Menninger, senior staff psychia-

trist at the Menninger Foundation.

be loners and don't have effective so-

"cial relations with other people, at least

currently. They are generally unmar-

ried or have had a very poor marital

relationship. They are people without a

consistent work history, particularly in

the year or so before the assassination

attempt is made.

They are individuals who consistent-

figure is appearing in public. Until the

attempts

President Ford, they were all males.

• Do assassins share a particular fam-

Ily background or class level?

A In nearly all instances, there has

been some hint of early disruption in

family life. The list does cut across class

somewhat, but the striking thing is

that, as yet, none have been black.

the desire for attention or

fame play a strong role in a person's de-

sire to kill a prominent person?

awareness that this is going to be a

notorious and even historic event.

Q Would the recent trend of closing

mental hospitals be putting more potentla!

assassins on the streets?

A I don't think there's clear evi-

dence that assassination is a function of

mental illness per se.

Q What about the growing leniency in

sentencing-does that raise the level of

assassination risks?

A The odds are that locking up peo-

ple longer for crimes is no

solution,

since people who have made assassina-

tion attempts are people who have

never committed a crime for which

they would have been locked up. Any-

way, our whole philosophy does not

call for preventive detention.

Q Would the frequency of assassina-

tion attempts in recent years be due, In

part at least, to the media-especially the

influence of television?

A Not necessarily. Yet I think the

great expansion of the media has pro-

duced an overload of communications

for some people- and television, which

makes an event so immediately known,

can certainly be a factor.

Q Do assassinations in this country of

ten develop from political or economic

grievances?

A More so in the last century, per-

haps, assassins have had some kind of

specific but distorted political reason to

justify their action-but not as a mem-

ber of an organized political move-

ment. They are personal zealots.

In the Reagan case, I don't think we

really know the motivation of the ac-

cused assassin, despite press reports.

Q Is it significant that, in this country,

attacks on leaders come from loners,

while Western Europe's problem is terror-

Ist groups?

A That's one of the striking

con-

trasts thus far: We have been less sub-

ject to the terrorist approaches. That

doesn't mean we may not be, and I'm

well aware that the FBI and other

federal law-enforcement agencies are

constantly concerned about that

-possibility.

Q Is there some way to greatly reduce

the threat of assassination in the United

States?

A There's no simple answer. In

democratic philosophy, the elected

leader frequently performs ceremonial

and political tasks in public. There is no

perfect way to forestall attempted as-

sassinations short of confining the Pres-

ident to the White House and limiting

his communication with the public to

television broadcasts and other media.

Other nations can, by totalitarian

means, limit people's access to travel as

well as to weapons. I don't think we're

about to go in that direction.

By ROBERT PEAR

Special to The New YOrk Times

- WASHINGTON, April 2 - A court-ap-

pointed psychiatrist has found John W

Hinckley Jr. competent to stand trial in

the shooting of President Reagan, but a

Federal judge today ordered a more ex-

tensive mental examination, which could

take from 30 to 90 days.

The 25-year-old defendant, wearing a

bulletproof vest, appeared in Federal

District Court today, for two separate

hearings that lasted a total of slightly

more than 40 minutes. Security was ex-

tremely tight.

Dr. James L. Evans, the court-ap

pointed

psychiatrist, examined

Mr.

Hinckley for three/hours yesterday. Dr.

Evans's report, feleased by the court

today, was that Mr. Hinckley was "men-

tally competent to stand trial," that he

had "a rational and factual understand-

ing of the charges and is able to partici-

pate with counsel in the preparation of his

defense."

Deals Only With Competency

However, such a finding deals only

with the-suspect's competency to stand

trial and does not deal with the question

of sanity at the time of the shooting. Nor

¡does it preclude a plea of not guilty by

reason of insanity.

Judge William B. Bryant, chief, judge

of the Federal District Court here, said

today that he was authorizing a further

examination of Mr. Hinckley, for a period

not to exceed 90 days, to evaluate his

mental health more fully. Judge Bryant

said Government psychiatrists would

study the broader quéstion of whether

Mr. Hinckley was responsible for his con-

duct at the time of the shooting on Mon-

day.

Justice Department officials said'that

the evaluation of Mr. Hinckley's mental

health would be made at the Federal, Cor

rectional Institution in Butner. N.C.

where there is a special psychiatric pro-

gram for evaluating Federal prisoners.

Court Orders Sanity Tests for Hinckley

But Delays Them to Allow for an Appeal

By a FALL STREET JOURNAL BiajI ReporteT

* WASHINGTON- A federal judge ordered

atric facilty for tests to determine if he was

President.

redera Prison,

Judge

William Bryant ordered medical experts se-

lected bythe government and by Mr. Hinck-

ley's lawyers to have equal access, to him

there. But Judge Bryant delayed all exami-

nations until after 12:30 p.m. today to give

Mr. Hinckley's lawyers time to appeal. They

sought permission to have their medical

team examine him before government doc-

tors, do.

The determination of Mr. Hinckley's psy-

chological state appeared likely to be an im•

portant part of the case. Vincent Fuller, the

lead attorney representing it. Hinckley,

said his experts needed quick access to their

client "to consider whether.. a defense of

insanity will be raised in this case."

Earlter yesterday, Mr. Hinckley's attor-

neys conceded that he was mentally compe-

tent to stand trial, and waived his right to a

preliminary hearing. Mr.

Reagan and with assault with a gun on a Se-

policeman,

both of

whom were injured in the assassination at-

tempt.

Mr. Fuller read into the court record a

briet report from court psychiatrist James

Evans, who examined Mr. Hinckley Wednes-

dav at the Quantico manne base where he

is being held. Mr. Evans determined that

Mr. Hinckley is currently "mentally compe:

tent to stand trial in that he has a rational

and factual understanding of the charges

and is able to participate with counsel in the

preparation of his defense."

Evaluations of whether he was responsi-

ble for his actions would take much longer,

attorneys said.

According to Michael Tigar, a criminal

attorney, the criteria loi determination of

legal insanity in District of/Columbia federal

courts is whether a person "lacks substan-

tial capacity either to appreciate the crimi-

nality of his conduct or to conform his con-

duct to the requirements of the law."

When a defense is based on insanity, fed-

eral courts here have preferred a two-stage

trial, according to Mr. Tigar. The first

phase assesses the guilt or innocence and, if

guilty, the second would determine whether

the accused was insane at the time.

The Butner prison, where Mr. Hinckley is

expected to undergo examinations for as

• Jong as one month, is a medium-security fa- -

cility with some

and a psychiatric hospital unit, a Justice De

and what appeared to be a white, bullet:

proof vest. He occasionally whispered to one

of his lawyers, but otherwise said nothing

preliminary hearing.

Separately, Treasury Secretary Donald

Regan told a congressional panel he thought

court here. At that time, Hinckley could enter a plea,

if his lawyers decide he should. If he were to plead

guilty, sentencing would be delayed pending a pre-

sentence report by probation officers who would

examine his background and make recommendations

to the presiding-judge.

If, as expected, Hinckley pleads not guilty, trial

must be held within 30 days under terms of the

federal speedy trial law. But defense lawyers fre.

quently file motions that result in delay; and it

sometimes takes many more months to begin a trial.

The best guess at the U.S. District Courthouse

here is that Hinckley's trial will begin in about six

months.

c Fears of Explosive Bulla

Force Surgery on Officer

By Charles R. Babcock

and Pete Barley

Washingion Post Stalf Wrilers

District of Columbia police dicer nomas a

Belahanty underwent successful emergency surger

at Washington Hospital Center last night to remove

a bullet lodged in his neck after the FBI concluded

that alleged assailant John W. Hinckley. u. may

have been firing explosive

"Devastator" bullets at

President Reagan.

FBI spokesman Roger Young said the decision to

operate on Delahanty — one of three men wounded

with Reagan in Monday's attack — was made be-

cause it was possibile that an explosive charge in

the slug of the .22-caliber bullet was unstable and

could detonate.

A Washington Hospital Center spokesman said

last night that Delahanty agreed to the surgery and

that two volunteer doctors, reportedly wearing flak

jackets, operated on him in an isolated room.

Delahanty-was in. "serious but.sta-

ble" condition early today after about

three hours of surgery during which

the bullet was removed, a hospital

spokesman said.

The bullet was turned over to the

FBI, but there was no immediate in-

formation as to whether it was a

"Devastator." An FBI spokesman said

the bullet would be examined this

morning.

Authorities began considering the

possibility that the rare bullets were

used in Hinckley's alleged attack on

the president when an empty cart.

ridge box with the "Devastator" Label

was found in Hinckley's hotel room

Monday afternoon.

Late yesterday afternoon,

FBI

agents found in the car fragments of

. the bullet that hit the president's lim-

ousine window. Delahanty's doctors

were told of the increased possibility

that he had been hit by an explosive

bullet,

and

surgery

was ordered,

Young said.

Four fragments of a bullet had been

removéd Monday from the brain of

presidential press secretary James S.

Brady, Young said.

The bullet that hit Reagan in the

chest ricocheted off his limousine but

did not explode, and will be examined

today to determine it it, too,

is a

"Devastator," Young said. He said it is

possible that all six of the bullets fired

were the exploding "Devastators."

It is not known why some of the

bullets

allegedly fired by Hinckley

apparently exploded while others did

not. For instance, the bullet that hit

Brady may have exploded when it

struck his skull, Young said. Others

may have malfunctioned, he said.

The bullet is designed to explode

and fragment in impact. It is made

by Bingham Lita,, a firm in Norcros

Ga., by putting an aluminum ca

filled with explosive into the nose of a

normal .22-cal. long

, rifle cartridge.

: The cartridges cost $7.12 for a box of

12, compared with a top retail price

• of about $2.40 for a box of 50 stan-

dard cartridges.

Young said it is not known yet

where Hinckley could have purchased

the deadly cartridges or how many he

bought. An official of the Bingham

company told a Washington Post re-

porter recently that his firm has been

making the "Devastators" since 1978

*ers nationwide.

Young said.

last night, saying-the-FBI-had-told the

hospital late in the afternoon that

"there was a very good possibility"

that the bullet lodged in Delahanty's

WASHINGTON, April 1 - John W.

Hinckley Jr., accused of shooting Presi-

dent Reagan, underwent psychiatric

examination today as Federal investiga-

tors collected more evidence that they

said suggested he had been planning for

some time to attack the President.

Investigators have found itineraries for

Presidential trips in Mr. Hinckley's be-

longings, according to Federal officials

familiar with the investigation. They

have also recovered newspaper articles,

photographs and other material about as

sassinations in his hotel room here and in

¡ his family's home outside Denver.

Monday afternoon, according to inves-

tigators, Mr. Hinckley drafted a letter to

the actress Jodie Foster in which he dis

cussed his plan to attack the President. It

was recovered later, unmailed, in his

hotel room here.

"I Would Abandon Idea'

The page-and-a-half letter, hand-writ-

ten on lined paper, was dated 12:45 P.M.,

March 30, just an hour.and 45 minutes be-

fore the President was shot. Beginning

"Dear

"There is a definite possibility that I will

He added, "I would abandon this idea

Teen-Age Actress Says

Notes Sent by Suspect

Did Not Hint Violence

By MATTHEWL. WALD'

Spocial to The New York Tirses

NEW HAVEN, April 1 - The actress

Jodie Foster said today that she received

"several pieces of unsolicited corne

spondence" last fall from the suspect in

the shooting of President Reagan and

that she had thrown them away. But

When she received "three or four more

notes" at the beginning of March, the 18

year-old Yale freshman said, she gave

them to her dean.

• "In none of these letters and notes I re

ceived was any mention, reference or im-

plication ever made as to violent acts

against anyone, nor was the President

ever mentioned," she said this afternoon,

reading a statement to six reporters in-

vited to meet with her.

'Because they came in more frequent-

. ly," she added in response to a question

about the letters, "I automatically didn't

war't to assume anything, and I gave

them to the dean in order to be safe.""

Miss Fpster said that at one time last

year a police officer was assigned to pra-

tect her because of a handwritten kidnap

ping threat but that she had not seen the

threat and did not know if it was con-

nected to John W. Hinckley Jr., who has

been charged with attempting to kill Mr.

Reagan. The Federal Bureau of Investi:

gation is examining the handwritten let-

ter to see if it can be linked to Mr. Hinck-

ley, sources close to the investigation

said. Miss Foster said that she had never

met Mr. Hinckley.

Investigators have suggested that Mr..

Hinckley may have been trying to 'im--

press Miss Foster when he allegedly shot

the President on Monday, wounding three

other people as well. After the shooting,

investigators found an unmailed letter to

Miss Foster in Mr. Hinckley's hotel room

in Washington in which he had written, "I

have killed the President," according to

sources familiar with the investigation.

The letters, received by Miss Foster

last month were given to Eustace Theo

dore, dean of Calhoun College, on March

6, and he gave them to the campus police

the following Monday. The campus police

have not said when they were turned over

"I'm not allowed to reveal any of the

contents, because I don't want to jeopard.

ize the prosecution," Miss Foster, said,

"The letters were

have been love type letters."

She said that the Federal Bureau of In-

vestigation had asked her not to say how

the letters were delivered. Mr. Hinckley

checked into the Colony Inn, adjacent to

the Yale campus, for one night in October

and another in February, according"to

the hotel manager. According to pub

lished accounts, the notes were slipped

under the door.of Miss Foster's dormitory

'PReacted Badly'

Seated in a lounge of Calhoun College,

to which she is assigned, and accompa-

nied by her mother, Brandy Foster, Miss

Foster described how she had learned

that the suspect in the attempted assassi-

nation had the same name as the man

who had written to her. Knowing oniy

that Mr. Reagan had been shot, she re-

turned to her room at about 9 P.M. and

was greeted by a roommate, who had

previously heard her mention Mr. Hinck.

"I walked in the door, and she said,

'Jodie! John Hinckley!'"

"I said, 'John Hinckley what?'" Miss

"She said "John Hinckley! John Hinck-

Experts Say

Films Can Prod

The Disturbed

BY JERRY BISHOP

8tOJS REPOTLET Of THE WALI:STREET JOURNAL

Could a movie trigger a person to at-

tempt such a violent act as assassinating a

President?

Given a person with the right-or ratber

wrong-type of personality, this very likely

could haopen, say psychiatrists and psycho!-

ogists who have studied the matter.

John W. Hinckley Jr.,

the young man

charged with the attempted slaying of Presi-

dent Reagan, is said to have

been

'in-

spired by the movie "Taxi Driver." The

film concerns a mentally disturbed cab

driver who plots to kill & U.S. Senator and

who at one point tells his teen-aged prosti-

tute paramour,

"If you don't love me I'm

going to kill the President."'

The Unmailed Letter

Investigators reportedly found a letter in

Mr. Hinckley's hotel room addressed to the

actress who portrayed the prostitute in

""Taxi Driver" Jodie Foster. In the un-

mailed™ letter,

according

to Washington

sources, Mr. Hinckley says he killed

the

President. This has led to speculation that if

Mr. Hinckley is the one who attempted to

kill Mr. Reagan, he might have been acting

out a fantasy inspired by the movie.

"Psychiatrists and psychologists who have

studied-the effects of violent movies, televi-

...--

sion and general publicity about violent acts

on people are reluctant to make "armchair"

diagnoses of Mr. Hinckley or the effect on

him of "Taxi Driver." But they say that in

general, movies, television and publicity

could be the catalysts for certain types of

aggressive or mentally disturbed persons to

carry out violent acts.

Eager Viewers

"Everyone watching a film tends to get

Involved in it at the time," says Dr. Harvey

Greenberg, associate clinical professor of

psychiatry at New York's Albert Einstein

College of Medicine and author of the book,

"Movies on Your Mind," a psychological

study of motion pictures.

For most people, Dr. Greenberg says, the

Involvement ends shortly after the movie is

over. But for others it is longer lasting.

"I've seen people who become very

in-

volved, and they're not crazy people," he

says. Some people even mold

their lives

around the personalities of such stars as

Humphrey Bogart or Bette Davis.

"For more troubled people, this involve-

ment with the movies can merge into reality

and it becomes real life," he says.

Increased Threats

Usually Follow

Assassin Attacks

By T. R. Reid

Washlagton Poet Btaft Wrtter

As the nation looks back with relief at

President Reagan's narrow escape from more

"serious injury in Monday's shooting, security

anicials are looking shead to the immediate

future with concern as they recall a chilling

aspect of the last attack on a president. Just

• 17 days after one assailant pointed a gun at

Gerald ford in 1975, another disturbed per-

son made another attempt on the president's

And those attempts by Lynette Fromme

and Sara Jane Moore immediately prompted

a rush of further spoken and written threats

on the president's life. Then-Secretary of the

Treasury William E. Simon said just after

the second Ford incident that the number of

threats against the president was triple the

normal rate in the days following the two

incidents. Publicity about assassination at-

tempts "tends to invite... deranged human

beings to come out," Simon said.

'Security officials and psychiatrists say the

• increase in threats following an assassination

attempt is a fairly common pattern; people

who have had the idea of attacking a pres.

ident somewhere in the backs of their minds

tend to become more serious about it.

This poses a problem for Reagan and his

advisers as they contemplate the conduct of

the presidency when Reagan returns to the

White House. Should the president purpose-

ty restrict his exposure to crowds — one

member of Congress, Sen. Larry Pressler

(R-S. D.) proposed yesterday that Reagan

• limit future appearances outside Washington

to miliatry installations - or should be

make a point of emphasizing that his style

in office will not be changed because of pos-

sible attacks?

Publicly, at least, Ford chose the latter

course. Hours after a shot from Sara Jane

Moore's pistol had sailed over his head, Ford

rowed not to "cower" or "capitulate" to de

ranged persons. "If we can't have the oppor

tunity of talking with one another, seeing

one another, shaking hands with one anoth-

er, something has gone wrong in our society."

Reagan's chief of staff, James A. Baker

Il, said yesterday the

administration is

thinking about the possibility of reducing

Resgan's exposure to large crowds in the

future. But he noted that Reagan is an out-

going individual who enjoys contact with the

people.

White House aides said it is possible that

. Reagan will wear a bulletproof vest in future

public appearances - such as he occasion-

ally did during the 1980 presidential cam-

paign. Ford began wearing a bulletproof vest

after the attempts to shoot him.

Meanwhile, official Washington is consid-

ering the larger questions of how protection

can be balanced against the interests of an

open society.

Two congressional subcommittees have

scheduled hearings today focusing on Secret

Service procedures and the general problem

of protecting a president. The senate Ap.

propriations Committee chaired by James

Abdnor (R-S. D.) will question Secret Ser-

vice Director H. Stuart Knight about pro-

tective measures in general and Monday's

incident in particular.

Also today, a House subcommittee will

question Treasury Secretary Donald Regan

— who has jurisdiction over the Secret Ser-

vice — about the same points. Another

House subcommittee plans a private session

with Secret Service officials to discuss details

of Monday's shooting.

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the

younger brother of two men murdered by

assassins, said yesterday that the attack on

Reagan demonstrates anew the need for

legal controls on handguns.

But congressional sources said there didn't

appear to be much likelihood that the broad

handgun restrictions Kennedy favors could

be approved.

Reagan's closest aide, White House coun-

selor Edwin Meese III, said in a television

interview.that he-opposes-gun-control laws.

Where such laws are on the books, "so far,

Asst. Dir.:

By PHILIP TAUBMAN

Special to The New York Times

WASHINGTON, March 31 - Federa:

investigators have found evidence that

they believe suggests that John W. Hinck-

ley Jr., accused of the attack on Presi-

dent Reagan yesterday, was seeking to

impress Jodie Foster, a teen-age actress

whom he had apparently never met.

"I have killed the President," Mr.

Hinckley wrote to Miss Foster in an un-

mailed letter investigators found in his

Washington hotel room yesterday, ac.

cording to sources familiar with the in-

vestigation.

According to another account,

Mr.

Hinckley wrote, "It you don't love me,

I'm going to kill the President."

Imagined Insuit Cited

Mr. Hinckley apparently imagined that

Mr. Reagan had somehow insulted Miss

Foster,

officiais said. This suggestion

was contained in another letter to the ac

tress that Mr. Hinckley sent in recent

each. On Monday,

Federal authorities

say, he used one of the pistols to shoot

President Reagan.

Today Federal investigators were sift-

ing through the recent years of Mr.

Hinckley's life to determine how he might

have come to attack the President and

whether he might have attempted to

harm any other political leaders.

Once, Mr. Swatford said, he went into

• Calvin

Wynne,' a

maintenance

worker

an apartment compex in

Lubbock,

Tex.,

where Hinckley lived

last tall while attending Texas Tech,

said he remembered,

after seeing

Hinckley's face flash on the television

Monday,

speaking to him

twice.

Wynne said Hickley showed "great

hostility" toward the government, and

felt "there were some political leaders

he thought should be eliminated.

"He just basically had no allegiance

to any authoritarian control," Wynne

said, according to the Lubbock Ava-

lanche-Journal.

Wynne said Hinckley's attitude and

personality were "strained,"

and it

seemed as though he "had something

on his mind."

"There was a nervousness

about

him," Wynne said. "Hyperactive,

is

that what you call it? He moved

about a lot. He got more anxious,

more hyper as the conversation wore

on, like he wanted to do something."

Texas Tech University history pro-

fessor Joseph King recalled Hinckley

only because he was the most quiet,

the most unobtrusive student he had

lectured to in the fall of 1979, when

Hinckley was enrolled in King's U.S

Economic History course.

"I recall him mainly because he was

so quiet and attentive," King said.

"While everyone else in the class ex-

hibited a kind of camaraderie, he al-

ways sat alone on the left side of the

roum, surrounded by empty chairs.

Even during humorous moments in

class, he would continue to gaze at me

attentively, taking notes."

Hinckley,

King said,

, wrote an "excellent" review

for the course of a book on American

slavery.

Texas Tech records show several

mysterious breaks in Hinckley's uni-

versity career. He started in the fall of

1973 and attended in the spring of

1974, but there are no records for him

during the summer and fall of 1974.

He returned to the university in the

spring of 1975, came back the follow-

ing fall and attended in the spring of

1976. But he was not at the universi-

ty during either the fall semester of

1976 or the following spring semester.

He came back in the summer of 1977

and distinguished himself by main-

taining a B average and making the

Dean's List.

Then there was Hinckley's apparent

fascination with guns, which seemed

to grow in proportion to his increas-

ingly lonely spiritual sojourn. In 1979

and 1980 he purchased a total of six

guns, three in Dallas, two in Lubbock

and one elsewhere, all from pawn-

shops that buy and resell an assort-

ment of musical instruments, jewelry,

guns and encyclopedias.

RG

All of the handguns were made by

tries in Miami, a small com-

pany

assembles cheap handguns

from parts manufactured by Roehm

Industries, a West German firm. The

first handgun was .38-caliber revolver,

purchased by Hinckley from Pappa

Daddy's Galaxy Pawn Shop in Lub.

bock. A year later, he purchased two

.22-caliber revolvers from Snidely

Whiplash Pawn Shop also/in Lub

bock.

On Oct. 9, roughly a month after

Hinckley bought the two pistols, he

was arrested at the Nashville airport

after an officer there noticed what he

believed was a gun barrel while

Hinckley was going through an elec-

tric metal detector. When officer John

Lynch opened the suitcase he found

two revolvers in their original. boxes.

"The plastic was still wrapped around

the boxes," Lynch said. "He told me

they were good guns. He said he was

going north to sell them or give them

to some friends."

After posting $62.50 bond, Hinckley

vanished from Nashville, never show-

'ing up for his trial. Instead, he appar-

ently returned to Texas, to Dallas,

where four days later he bought two

more guns. Yesterday in Dallas, Isaac

(Rocky) Goldstein, owner of Rocky's

pawnshop

which

Hinckley

bought the .22-caliber weapon alleged-

ly used in Monday's shooting, took his

phone off the hook and reportedly

hired a bodyguard after anonymous

callers threatened him and his busi-

ness.

Hinckley purchased two guns from

Rocky's and the salesman -who sold.

them to him quit yesterday when the

shop received an avalanche of phone

calls. Both Goldstein and his son

David said they did not remember

Hinckley, and the only records they

have of the suspect's visits to the

federal authorities.

Hinckley lived in Lubbock over a

seven-year period, but left little im.

pression on the memories of people he

came in contact with, except for the

trail of paper and records of apart-

ments rented and guns bought.

Only occasionally, as in his conver-

sations with the Lubbock maintenance

man, were aspects of his life and his.

problems remembered. It was in

lexas that Hinckley first met mem-

bers of the National Socialist Party of

America, who took him with them on

an automobile journey in March 1978

to St. Louis, where he participated in

an NSPA march to commemorate the

birthday of George Lincoln Rockwell,

founder of-the American Nazi Party,

"He seemed committed to our

cause; he was

aht, a little under-

stated," said

ael C. Allen, acting

director of the group, recalling the St.

Louis march. "He wore uniforms like

the rest of us — he was a stormtroo-

per. Black boots, the swastika, khakis

and the black helmet. But he was too

militant. He wanted to destroy our

enemies - blacks,

Jews,

Commu-

nists."

"It got to the point? said party

stormtrooper John Gaynor, "that we

suspected him of being a federa

agent. He was just too far out. He

wanted to destroy people."

Hinckley, according to Allen, lasted

only a year in the party, The same

- semester at Texas Tech during which

he studied

German concentration

camps and Hitler's "Yein Kamp" he

was expelled from the party.

If it wasn't Hinckley's sometime

bizarre behavior that people remem-

bered, it was the deceits, the occasion-

al lies and half-truths. Two weeks

after he was released by police in

Nashville, he was in Denver, looking

for work.

In noncursive, undramatic, under-

stated handwriting on a job applica-

tion to the Rocky Mountain News,

Hinckley lied about job references and

his academic standing. He desired, he

wrote, a writing or circulation job pay-

ing in excess of $4 an hour, and wrote

that he had previously worked as a

bookkeeper at a Dallas publishing

house, a photographer in Los Angeles,

and a salesman in Hollywood. He

wrote that he had graduated from

Texas Tech with a degrèe in English

and journalism, and expressed an in-

terest in politics and reading

The News, and the Denver Post, to

which

he aiso applied for

a job,

checked his credentials and found

them false.

But it was at the Golden Hours

Motel in Denver, where Hinckley

lived for 16 days before leaving town

eight days ago, that the mysterious

wanderer left the most mundane, yet

memorable, impressions.

The hotel, located on a noisy thor-

oughfare across the street from a Ford

dealership and

' a McDonald's,

is

owned by the Chon Lee family.

Hinckley lived in room 30 on the sec.

ond floor. On March 8, Hinckley

drifted into the hotel requesting a

"cheap place to stay," according to the

daughter of the owner.

He said he would pay by either day

or week, and when the girl told him

the weekly rate was $74.25, he paid

the amount in cash. He was driving a

white Plymouth Volare bearing Texas

license plates which had expired last

year.

In the letter, addressed to actress Jodie Foster but

never mailed, Hinckley said that he-was going to do

comething that might get him killed and that he did

tot care what happened to him.

Among other roles, Foster appeared as a 13-year-

id prostitute in the Robert De Niro-film "Taxi-

Jriver." DeNiro played a New York cabby who

"Hathorities bave said that television and movie

depictions of violence could trigger violent acts in

some unbalanced individuals.

"TELEVISION intoxication" was used as an un.

successful defense in the trial of a youth, Ronny

Zamora, who was found guilty in a Florida case of

beating an elderly neighbor to death. Love of TV

police shows was cited as a defense in the recent case

of "Robert," the I year-old bank robbery suspect.

The pattern of assassination has been different in

other countries, where most assassinations have

political motivations, Tanay says. "Only psychotics

in this country attack Presidents," he says.

The one exception was the attempt by Puerto

Rican nationalists on the life of President Truman at

Blair House in Washington in 1050: Their emnounged

motive was to gain independence for Puerto Rico.

Aside from that attempt, Tanay says, "these are

not political activities.

There is a need for the

assassin to find a symbolic figure to attack."

AMERICAN ASSASSINS have been remarkably

similar. Dr. David.N. Daniels, a psychiatrist at

Stanford University, describes the pattern in a book,

A 'nobody' becomes

"somebody'

By ALTON SLAGLE

John Marnock Hinckley Jr. was nothing special. He was just one of those

quiet individuals who goes through life unnoticed. Perhaps that was his trouble.

His older brother was a "somebody"; he had joined their dad in a multi-million

dollar oil business. His younger sister was a "somebody," too; she had acquired a

husband and a fancy home. John, meanwhile, just drifted.

In 1974, Hinckley was a handsome, blond youth, quiet, well mannered,

graduate from a high s hool in the exclusive Dallas suburb of Highland Park. He

had just turned 19, and his life was one of mansions, backyard swimming pools,

nome Coke machines and school activities. Not particularly scholarly or athletic,

he was, said a teacher, "quiet, very reserved," and "didn't give anyone any

Three weeks ago, John Hinckley, his body now pudgy, his face florid, his

othing shabby, walked into G.I. Joe's Pawn Shop in Denver to hock a six-strin

lectric guitar and a Smith-Corona typewriter for $50. A clerk said he looked "lik

a man down on his luck," a man, it is now charged, who was to end a

ross-country bus trip by attacking the life of the President of the United States

SOMEWHERE IN THOSE SEVEN years, he took a bizarre turn. As he drifted

from his family, the quiet boy of 1974 apparently became a psychologically

tormented 25-year-old loner, who was ejected from the American Nazi Party as a

troublemaker, who lived with virtually no belongings in fithy; garbage-strewn

rooms, who rejected his father's money and his mother's smothering love and

who turned his back on his strict Christian heritage.

Hinckley had been given every advantage. What went wrong?

In high school, Hinckley belonged to the Roded Club, the Spanish Club, the

Student Government Club. "He was not a rowdy," said Redee Club-sponsor-Bill

Lieberman. Principal A.E. Sigler recalled "nothing special" about the boy.

A FRIEND NAMED GREGG-KALINA called John "mellow..: a follower, not

a leader, and basically fairly lazy not a guy to pick a fight," a boy, with a

protective mother who "babied him."

"He just wasn't a great personality, a jock or intellectual or anything that

distinguishing," said Craig McDaniels, another classmate.

Perhaps that was the problem.

After he finished high school, his father moved the family to the wealthy

Denver suburb of Evergreen, about 20 miles from the downtown headquarters of

his Vanderbilt Energy Corp., a successful oil and gas exploration firm. John

•decided, instead, to migrate to Lubbock, Tex., a quiet, dusty, cotton and cattle

town of 160,000 people on the tabletop-flat west Texas plains. He enrolled in

Texas Tech University, planning to study business administration, later switching

to liberal arts. But his favorite seemed to be history-Nazi history.

IN THE SECOND SUMMER session of 1978, Dr. Otto Nelson taught him a

course in modern Germany. Nelson said Hinckley was particularly attentive and

diligent when the subject turned to Hitler and the Auschwitz death camp. And he

avidly read Hitler's "Mein Kampf"-not "the kind of book a student would pick

up to get a historical view of Germany," Nelson said. Last Spring, Hinckley

reportedly signed up for a course in modern European social movements entitled

"Socialism, Communism, Anarchism-and Fascism." But he never appeared in

Dr. Joseph. King taught him U.S. economic history in the fall of 1979 and

recalls that John was attentive; above average. "I remember him distinctly," King

said. "I remember he didn't look like his new pictures; he looked like his early

photos." King said his student took careful notes, always sat alone and "never

really laughed at my jokes."

he University Arms, where Hinckley once lived, remembers the suspect in th

attempted assassination of the President. Wynne recalls a conversation during

last year's political campaign in which Hinckley showed hostility toward

government and had no allegiance to authority.

"We were talking about Reagan," Wynne said. "He was trying to defend Ed.

Clark, the National Libertarian candidate. He said, 'If I had to make a choice, I

vould pick Clark, but none of them know what they're doing. They're all toc

Yynne said the youth's attitude was strained, as if he had something on hi

nind and wanted to tell his problem to someone. Hinckley was nervous an

hyperactive, he said.

Mark Swoffard, who helped manage one Lubbock apartment complex where

linckley lived in 1979, recalls him as "so damn strange," a man who was alway

alone and never talked to anyone. He said the $175-a-month apartment was "a

mess," with "garbage piled up all over the cabinets and even in the bookshelves."

Other than garbage, he said, "it looked like no one lived there."

IINCKLEY'S PHOTO IN LA VENTANA, the Teeb yearbook, listed no clul

nemberships or activities. But he was active in one area. Last September, a

Lubbock Pawnshop, he bought a .22-caliber pistol.

As Hinckley drifted in and out of university life, he alternated classes with odd

jobs—a salesman in Hollywood, a bookkeeper in Dallas, a bartender in Denver

He decided to be a réporter. Last October, in Denver, he applied for werk at both

the Denver Post and The Rocky Mountain News, citing a college degree he

lacked-rexas Tech, '80, English and journalism, with some time at Yale-and

job experience he may or may not have had Under "hobbies" on his job

applications, he listed "reading, sports, pplitics. He was pot hired.

• Indeed, he had a stint with politics. In 1978, he met Michael C. Allen,

president-elect of the Nazi-style National Socialist Party of America, during a

neo-Nazi march in St. Louis. The next year, he joined the party.

BUT IN THAT, TOO, there was disappointment. "He felt the party was not

sufficiently militant for him," said Harold A Covington, the president. "He felt

we should be waging armed struggle against the government." And, said Allen

nut." The party expelled him, and the roaming continued.

sast Oct. 9, Hinckley showed up in Nashville on the day President Carter wa.

holding a "town hall" meeting at the Grand Ole Opry. Ronald Reagan had jus

canceled a campaign stop there: Hinckley tried to leave aboard an American

irlines jet with three handguns--two .22-caliber R.G. Model 14s and a .38 calibe

pistol, along with 50 rounds of ammunition. The metal detector used by airport

security caught him, and he was arrested.

aboard planes. He was merely fined $50 plus $12.50 in court costs and was

IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, say experts- in retrospect. The signs were there.

"John had been under psychiatric care," said a spokesman for his heartbroken

family. "However, the evaluations did not alert anyone to the seriousness of his

condition."

Dr. Stuart Berger, a New York forensic psychiatrist, said Hinckley "seems

severely disturbed." Berger described the would be assassin as "isolated and

The President's breathing is painful be-

brain injuries, one of the doctors

called his progress "extraordinary."

"Everybody's very encouraged," said

Brady's old boss, Sen. William Roth

wife and one of his doctors at the

hospital. "Things are going better than

However, one of the doctors in-

that before surgery Brady's doctors

feared that expansion of the right half

might cause fatal pressure on the

brain stem, which maintains breathing,

and awareness.

A doctor involved in the case said,

that the team of neurosurgeons, head-

ed by Dr. Arthur I. Kobrine, removed

"a lot of brain tissue" from the right

frontal lobe. They also took out the

A much smaller amount of tissue de-

doctor said.

Doctors do not operate in every

In this case, however, emergency sur-

decrease the presure on undamaged

immediately be greeted by platoons of

specialists of every kind.

Then —

since he was bleeding internally and

seriously from his wounded lung —

the bleeding could be halted before it

became truly dangerous.

A report on his condition was given

yesterday by O'Leary, George Wash-

ington clinical (medical) aftairs dean,

at a White House briefing.

Despite a mostly sleepless night in

a busy intensive care unit — "not a

restful place," O'Leary said - Reagan

was alert and taking "almost no" pain

medication for what many persons

would find a painful condition.

Questioned closely about the presi-

dent's abilities should a crisis arise,

O'Leary said: "I think he is quite ca-

pable of making decisions and inter-

acting with people. I wouldn't encour-

age him to put in an 18-hour day, but

I am sure he can attend to the impor-

tant matters of government today.'

This assessment came just 18 hours

after the shooting of the president

Another George Washington sur

thought: "He's a performer. He recog-

nizes that people are responding to

him,

and he responds accordingly

.... He recognizes also, as any presi-

dent should, that he is the center of

attention, that people are aware of his

statements and he should be consid.

ered upbeat."

Then, for age 70, there is simply

that youth.

Dr. Eugene Erman, a Los Angeles

chest surgeon unconnected with the

case, said, "Many people do well after

such surgery. Some do exceptionally

well. He is one. I think you have to

remember that some people at 50

look like 70. Some at 70 look like 50.

This shows it.

in the "late 50s." O'Leary said, "he is

Reagan Staff Flan

For Interim Rule:

'Business as Usual'

By Lou Cannon

Washington Past Stalf Walter

Hours after Ronald Reagan was shot, even before the

bullet was removed from his chest, the White House senior

staff was drafting the blueprint for sustaining the momen-

,tum of the Reagan administration while the president re-

covers from his wound.

Presidential counselor Edwin Meese III

summarized the

strategy yesterday in a single sentence:

"Basically, the message is that this government is doing

business as usual."

Until the president is

safely returned to the White

House and fully back at work in the Oval Office, every

public gesture and activity will be aimed at demonstrating

that nothing fundamental has changed while he is away. As

it happens, the Reagan White House had at its fingertips a

handy guide from history — how the Eisenhower adminis-

tration maintained its equilibrium when Ike was hospital-

ized with a heart attack on Sept. 24, 1955.

"It's just as if the president were here in the Oval Office

the way the White House is running," said Michael K.

Deaver, the White House deputy chief of staff who was at

the president's side when he was wounded Monday.

Deaver's comment reflects a confidence among

senior

advisers that Reagan, from his hospital bed, will be able to

make the decisions that are required of a president.

The White House approach also demonstrated that

Meese, Deaver and chief of staff James A. Baker Ill have a

public relations awareness of the need to show that the

government has not been thrown off stride, despite the

trauma of the attack.

• Yesterday, for instance, the president's three senior ad-

visers held their usual early-morning meeting - only this

time it was around the president's hospital bed. At break:

fast, the president signed a bill, using his hospital traj as a

desk. Later, Vice President. Bush presided at an informal

Cabinet meeting, subbed for Reagan at a meeting with

congressional leaders and lunched

with the Dutch prime minister.

These small but important gestures

of continuity could well have been

lifted from the days of 1955 when

Vice President Richard Nixon filled in

for the recuperating president while

Eisenhower's senior staff kept the

government running.

Late Monday afternoon, when the

extent of Reagan's injury was not fully

known,

White House speechwriter

Tony Dolan sent Robert M. Garnck,

Meese's deputy, a memorandum. It

began this way: "During the Eisen-

'hower heart' attack period, the admin-

istration kept to the theme of business

" as usual."

Dolan's memo summarized the ap-

proach of the White House staff after

'President Eisenhower's heart attack.

statements that President Eisen

such an eventuality.

vice president. It was

This memo could well have de-

scribed the way that the senior White

House stait - and the vice president

- behaved on the second day of

Reagan's hospitalization.

After a breakfast meeting at the

hospital, the White House "Big Three"

adjourned for their regular morning

meeting with Reagan. This meeting

was held in the barren intensive-care

unit with the three staff members

grouped around the bed.

"T've really screwed up the sched.

ule," Reagan said to Deaver, who

keeps the president's schedule in the

White House.

In-fact, every effort was made yes-

terday — as it will be the rest of the

week — to see that the Reagan sched-

we is carried out by Bush. It is what

will happen again today, when Bush

presides over a National securts

Council meeting, and again on Thurs-

day when the vice president is sched

uled to chair a full meeting of the

Cabinet.

In all these actions both Bush and

the senior staff are careful to weigh

their words, in the manner suggested

by the Eisenhower staff experience, so

that no one forms the impression that

Bush has taken over as president.

"The decisions are being made by

the president," said Meese, in words

virtually identical to those uttered by

Baker and Deaver.

In administering the interim gov.

ernment until the president's full re-

covery, White House aides are count-

ing on the enormous asset of a presi.

dential style that they perceive as

gritty and courageous.

The Reagan wisecracks in the hos-

pital bed - "Does Nancy know about

us?" the president joked to a nurse

Monday night - and his physical re-

silence have convinced his aides that

the interim withöut him will be rela.

tively short. It has to be, in the opin.

ion of his closest congressional ally:

Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), who think

"Sympathy is a short-term

modity on Capito! Hill," says Laxal.

be needed to maintain public suppor

But the Nevadan predicts

the

White House staff will function

smoothly in Reagan's absence and

that Bush's performance will be ac-

ceptable to all factions. He also be-

lieves that the president has the con-

gressional schedule on his side in the

form of the Laster recess, which will

begin on April 10 and extend to April

"I would hope by that time Reagan

would be ready to go to work," Laxalt

While no one is making a predic-

tion like this at the White House, the

private expectations clearly are very

high. Reagan was scheduled to more

vate room late last night or early to-

day. Aides are talking about another

are even more optimistic than thai.

from an old Hollywood actor, that it

was staged and practiced. But there

was no staging what happened on the

street outside the Washington Hilton

and no time to practice the stream of

one-liners that followed.

No sooner did Mr.

Reagan alight

from his limousine at George Washing-

ton Hospital than the quips began, most

They were good medicine, leavening

the crisis, bouying an anxious nation

and showing the wounded leader to be a

man of genuine good humor and sunny

disposition.

Mrs. Reagan.

The timing for the punch line was ex-

By JERRY SCHMETTERER and STUART MARQUES

But the gun is deadly because the velocity of its bullets is

extremely high-greater even than a .38.

The small, inexpensive .22 caliber revolver-the kind

used to

shoot President Reagan-is "an

assassin's

weapon" that has become increasingly popular with

street criminals and mob hitmen.

"It's an assassin's weapon because it's small and light

and has no recoil," says Police Department ballistics

expert Edward McPhillips. "If you want to take someone

out in an alley, the .22 is the right weapon."

New York City police say 20% of the more than 10,000

guns confiscated last year were .22s, and officials say the

small gun is the

"most commonly used weapon in

felonies," because it's "easy to conceal and relatively

"YOU WOULDN'T WANT to trust your life to a .22;

it's just not a defensive weapon," McPhillips says.

The .22's weak "stopping power" was evident when

Reagan was able to walk into George Washington Univer-

sity Hospital even though he had been hit. Experts said a

bullet from a more powerful gun would have shattered

one of Reagan's ribs, rather than ricocheted off it.

Police said .22s are turning up more and more in street

robberies, "mob hits" and random murders, though there

are no figures on how many people were killed with the

weapon in New York. Since 1975, more than 30 mobsters,

including several informers, have been killed with .22.

caliber revolvers across the country.

Gun shop owners say the cheapest model .22 starts at

about $45. The gun, popular with target shooters, is a .

semi-automatic capable of up to nine shots.

Most are made abroad and shipped into the country in

parts to circumvent import laws. They are assembled in

various states where gun laws are lax, chiefly in Florida

and Georgia. The gun used to shoot Reagan reportedly

was assembled by RG Industries in Florida from parts®

made by its parent company, Roehm, in Germany.

Cops don't use the gun as an off-duty weapon because

Four black men were killed with .22s in a what may

have been a racially motivated series of murders in

Buffalo recently. Local police have dubbed the gunman

the ".22-caliber killer."

• By David Shribman

Washingion Star Stall Writer

The Secret Service is more than a

fraternity, it is a full-fledged college,

complete with alumni committees.

And so, when an incident thrusts

it into the public eye, even retired

members feel the shock waves. It has

almost always been that way.

"Every agent of the Secret Service,

no matter where he was Monday,

feels he was there," said a quarter-

century veteran of the service, now

retired.

"We all have pretty much

the same reaction - a feeling of ab-

ject frustration

and personal loss,

even if no one was killed. It's like a

family."

And though ine president's life

was spared in Monday's attack, a sad,

somber mood pervades the service.

Disecto's Sec'y.

By JANE E. BRODY

A national emphasis on civil liberties

for the mentally ill, the lack of cultural

restraints upon expressions of hostility

and the ready availability of pistols are

combining to make assassination an in-

creasingly common American event, ac-

cording to psychiatrists who have exam-:

ined the problem.

Assassination and assassination at-

tempts are more common here than in

any other country, experts on violence

maintain. In fact,

assassination is the l

leading cause of death of American Presi. 1

dents in office:

Unlike other countries, where assassi-

nations of heads of state are carried out

either by politicat fanatics or in the

course of a military coup, in this country

nearly all assassins have been personal-

ly, not politically, motivated.

"Here, assassination is often the prod.

uct of a single mentally disturbed person

who is alienated from_society, who feels

like a zero, is wanted by no one and can't

get a job," said Dr. Zigmond Lebensohn,

Though some assassins professed af-

not regard them as representatives. In

fact, the assassins were often rejected by

their chosen group or had ended their af

adIR Violent crime: new vigo.

* in the search for solutions

By Julia Malone

Staff correspondent of

The Christian Science Monitor

washington

The attempted assassination of the

President comes on the heels of growing

concern about violent crime in the United

States.

Just hours after the attempt on the Presi-

dent's life, the Federal Bureau of Investiga-

tion announced that incidents of major

crimes jumped by 10 percent in 1980. FBI

Director William H. Webster called it the

biggest increase in five years and "a con-

tinuing cause for concern by law enforce

ment and the American people."

US Chief Justice Warren E. Burger

grabbed the news headlines with his speech

in February decrying crime.

And the Senate Judiciary Committee re-

ports that letters are pouring in from citi-

zens who are "very, very upset about safety

in their neighborhoods."

Many people now are learning what

criminologists have known for years: that the US has the

highest crime rates among Western industrialized nations.

The rate of reported offenses is "three or four times" that of

similar countries, says Graeme Newman, professor of crimi-

nal justice at the State University of New York at Albany.

The murder rate for the first half of the 1970s was 9 per

100,000 in the US. Meanwhile, the corresponding rate for

Canada was 2.4, for the United Kingdom 1.0, and for Japan 2.

It's guns, say some observers. The private arsenals in

American households now add up to 50 million handguns. Vir-

tually every other Western industrialized country puts tight

controls on guns.

Other experts blame race discrimination, the anonymity

of big-city living, and the materialism of the culture.

Congress, which is traditionally expected to come up with

instant solutions for such problems, is considering a stack of

In the outrage and shock following this week's events,

Capitol Hill is bracing itself for a renewed controversy over

gun control. Thirteen years ago, it took the killings of Robert

F. Kennedy and of Martin Luther King Jr. to force Congress

to pass limited gun-control laws.

Now Rep. Peter Rodino (D) of New Jersey, who heads the

House Judiciary Committee, is pledging to redouble his ef-

forts to get a new, stiffer law.

His bill is expected to call for banning the so-called "Sat-

urday night special," as small, inexpensive guns are some-

times called, and provide a 21-day waiting period for anyone

wanting to buy a handgun, as well as require dealers to keep

records of serial numbers for 10 years.

So far. Representative Rodino has had little success with

his bill, which failed to make it to full committee consider:

ation last year. Meanwhile, in the Senate, Sen. James A. Mc:

Clure (R) of Idaho is reported to be almost ready to present a

bill to cut back on enforcement of the 1968 law.

Sen. Strom Thurmond (R) of South Carolina, chairman of

at keeping convicted felons in jail by cutting off access to

quire courts to consider evidence, even if police obtained it

illegally.

The Senate also is considering a bill to set legally accept-

Carter had targeted white-collar crime.)

And Attorney General William French Smith has an- rvs.

to combat violent crime.

James Q. Wilson, a member of that task force and a pro-: Rm. -

fessor of government at Harvard University, said that the

assassination attempt would have little effect on the group's

work. And he bristled at the idea that the crime against the

President was an indictment of American society.

"It is intellectually shabby to say that when a single

eranged person does something heinous, it is a commentar

n society as a whole," said Professor Wilson in a telephon

interview. He added that even in the 1830s American cities

had high crime rates and that no "instant theories" will re-

solve the problem.

Despite the Reagan administration's pronouncements on

violent crime, the proposed new budget shows no major

spending plans in the area. In fact, the new budget for the

This began as an amiable, tongue-in-

room. Somebody had shot at the Presi-

shot in the head. Policeman shot. Se

cret Service agent shot.

Despite so many years of it, the re-

sponses were precisely the same as al-

ways. Incredulity. Then a wave of hor-

ror and revulsion. The involuntary

groan: "My God." Then the dash for

There was the usual fiddling with

them. An acquaintance of mine died

not long ago at the hands of a burglar

who happened to have one as he went

about his work. I went to attend the fu-

neral and before I got back John Len-

non died at the hands of an autograph

seeker who happened to have a pistol.

On each occasion I heard the news

with incredulity, followed by a wave of

horror and revulsion and an involun-

tary groan of "My God." For my ac-

quaintance there was no dash to the

TV set to get the bulletins, only a fran-

tic series of long distance telephone

Over the years I have uttered that

"My God" for John Kennedy at 1 o'-

clock in the afternoon, for his brother

Robert at 7 A.M. on a beautiful June

moming, for Martin Luther King on a

windy spring night, for my friend just

before bedtime in the Christmas sea-

son, for Ronald Reagan in the middle

of a rainy afternoon with an amiable,

tongue-in-cheek piece about

ships in the typewriter.

It was not uttered upon the shooting

of Lee Harvey Oswald. What came out

who had been watching television saw
