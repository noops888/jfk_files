Re Phila. airtel 6/2/64, enclosing FD 142.

By separate cover Phila. is forwarding one Western

It has been ascertained that

a 500DR-3 Western Electric set is being installed in subject's

office, as described in referenced communique.

The only

difference between the two sets is that the 500MR-3 has four

conductor wires which will enable the desired alteration of

this set.

It is requested that the 500MR-3 be altered so that

a mite, mate or similar microphone will be installed in the /.

network of this phone.

Arrangements are that the subject is to receive

telephone service 6/9/64.

Accordingly, it is requested

that the altered set be returned to the Philadelphia Division

by 6/8/64, noting that the installation is not in Headquarters

City.

The above request is based on authorization requested

in referenced communication.

If authorization is this matter

is not granted, it is still requested that this

set be altered

as it is contemplated it will be used in a previously authorized

Bureau installation in the near future.
