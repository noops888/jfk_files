write a letter on the letterhead of GUEVARA's business, Concrete

pondence.

IBARGUEN allegedly had friends in Milan, Italy.

GUEVARA did not enter into any type of business relationship

with IBARGUEN.

GUEVARA indicated IBARGUEN had mentioned some-

thing about going to Florida to get a burist court.

that he had connects in Peru.

A few days later he showed up

with a friend from Chile in his twenties, who is a naturalized

United States citizen, at which time IBARGUEN mentioned about

having an order in cable form for 300 trucks from the government

of Chile.

GUEVARA was very dubious about this because the cable

said nothing about specifications and merely said the government

wanted 300 trucks. GUEVARA felt that this did not seem the

legitimate way of

doing business in view of the general nature

thereof.

GUEVARA advises that he had not heard any more from

IBARGUEN since Christmas, 1965 and has no information regarding

his present whereabouts.

GUEVARA advised that in the event he

should receive any additional information regarding IBARGUEN's

whereabouts he would advise this office.
