37. (Confidential - PG) LIAISON Received a telephone call

from Michael Glennon, Legal Counsel, Senate Foreign Relations

Subcommittee on International Operations, who was following up on a

request he made on4 November for a copy of the secrecy oath which

former DCI Richard Helms had signed. I told Mr. Glennon that I was

checking this out with the appropriate elements of CIA and hoped to

have an answer for him by the following day.

38. (Internal Use Only - PG) LIAISON Spent the better part

of the afternoon in the Coordination & Review staff conference room with

Michael J. Hershman, Deputy Staff Director, Subcommittee on

International Organizations, House International Relations Committee.

Also present were DDO representatives Evalina Vidal. Robert Brewster

(for only the beginning of the meeting) and

We discussed

the Subcommittee's request to make certain CIA information public

and Mr. Hershman gave us a summary he had prepared for the use of

Members at upcoming public hearings. Mrs. L

will review the

summary and sanitize it as necessary. The remainder of the session

was spent in an exchange of views as to CIA's role in ongoing

Congressional investigations of ROK/KCIA and related subjects.

39. (Internal Use Only - RJK) LIAISON Spoke with Lot Cooke,

on the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, concerning

William R. Harris, a consultant with the Committee who also works

for the Rand Corporation. Since Harris has already been briefed at

Rand on compartmented clearances, it will not be necessary for him to

receive a briefing on them at this time. Jack Williamson, SO/DGI,..

has been advised.

Cooke also requested the clearances held by Professor G. Robert

Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, House Select Committee on

Assassinations and Gary Cornwell, of the stall, because they wish to

review a sensitive Committee document. After checking with Dan Godar,

OS, I advised him that they had their proper clearances for reviewing

the documents.

40. (Unclassified - RSG) LIAISON Spoke with Betsey Wolf,

House

Select Committee on Assassinations staff, and offered to send to

her a copy of the document she reviewed here yesterday. The document

was an index of Freedom of Information Act exemptions on documents

involving the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. 19028
