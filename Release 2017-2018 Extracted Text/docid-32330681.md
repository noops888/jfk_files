On 10/4/68, DL 275-C-TE advised that GEBRON was

still working with MATTHEWS but was staying away from the apartment

at 5315 Columbia Avenue, as he is scared to death of the

local police making a raid and getting caught. From what TE

could learn GEBRON is working on the outside as runner and collec-

tor.
