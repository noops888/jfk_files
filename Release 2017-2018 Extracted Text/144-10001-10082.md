The personality and political background of President LYNDON

B. JOHNSON, as well as the circumstances which brought him to

power, seem to indicate that American foreign and domestic

policies, under the new Administration, will probably adhere to

the following basic directives:

1. In the short run, as a natural result of the momentum

of a strong Administration, such as' that of President KENNEDY, nO

profound changes are expected, especially in the field of foreign

policy (President JOHNSON has

already stated that he will follow

the foreign polisy of President KENNEDY) ;

2. In the longer run, however, one can foresee:

A) In the field of foreign policy, with the pre-

dominance of the State Department over the White House "staff"((A))

(which reflected the strong personality of President KENNEDY and

his marked interest in international policy), there probably

wi11 be:

I) No substantial change from the KENNEDY line

in relations with the Soviet Union; the new Administration will

tend toward a wait-andosee attitude;

II). In the field of relations with Western

Europe, or more precisely with France, a less rigid attitude

and one of greater acceptance of the French position, with the

objective of maintaining a united Western front vis-à-vis the

possibility of, a political offensive by the Kremlin;;

III) • In relations with Latin America, the inter-

view which President JDHNSON will have this afternoon with the

Foreign Minister will certainly be more enlightening than any

prediction made at this time;

B) In the field.

of domestic policy, there will possibly

be an improvement in relations between the Executive and the

Legislative within the line of "compromise" ((A)); the new Presi

dent, much more the conservative than the innovator, with intimate

connections with the Congress, and a Southerner, will have more

facility in (gaining] approval of, the big bills ("civil rights,"

"fiscal reform," "medical aid," "ald to the aged," etc.) precisely

because he will accept more conservative formulas of compromise;

the new Administration will also tend' to be more consèrvative with

regard to government intervention in the economy; however, radical

changes cannot be expected, since JOHNSON will also face the

pressure of the more liberal wing of the Depocratic Party, and

any more pronounced split within the Party would be fatal

to the

hopes for victory in next year's election.
