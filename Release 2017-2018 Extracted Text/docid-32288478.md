ROTI:

PAT it's just what CHARLIE FITZGERALD told me

and I related it to you and I don't know if you

related it to them people.

He used to sit down

with my father and say BRUNO, all I gotta do

is go sit on Rush Street or I can send a guy

into the LeBistro.

They could sit next to

MARSHALL and a couple of Jews.

We find out

every (obs) thing we wanta know!

He says you

people, he says, the

only reason I'm telling

ya this is because you're a friend of mine.

He

says but those other guys (obs) those guys!

He says they got the biggest mouths in town.

MARCI:

Did he ever tell

ya anything about me?

ROTI:

Never once, I swear to God did he ever, say anything

bad about you. But don't put it off PAT, may

be that's where JOHN made his mistake by putting

it off.

MARCI:

Any contract that JOHN ever got from them,

you know I handled it for him.

ROTI:

I remember I was with my old man one time when

he went to JOE and he says what are you trying

to give us down there and JOE says whata ya

mean.

And I thought we were gonna get thrown

out the window.

And the old man says where did

you get that (obs) grease ball. And my old man

went on to tell him and JOE says well my God

we got rid of one (obs) and now we got another.

And then my old man says what are you fooling

around with these old men for and he went on

to tell JOE about the young talent like you

and JOHN and JOE says well whata you know about

it. And my old man says I wouldn't mention

anything if I didn't know about it. And JOE

says well we'll see and then pretty soon you

guys were in.

It is obvious from the above conversation tht MARCI

and ROTI again discussed the change wherein State Senator

DE TOLVE is to replace D'ARCO as Alderman of the First Ward. '

The reference to DE TOLVE's reputation is to the fact that

he is not considered to be particularly intelligent or

aggressive. CG 6498-PC, another leading West Side politician,

has advised in the past that he is a fairly close associate

-7.

of DE TOLVE but considers him

â€¢ a very naive individual who is

constantly the brunt of practical joking by the PCI and otber

high-level Italian politicians. Although no recent questions

have been directed to this PCI concerning DE TOLVE due to the

sensitive nature of this source he has previously advised

that it is his opinion that FRED ROTI is the logical person..

to succeed in the event such a change would ever be contemplated.

He very seriously doubts that DE TOLVE would ever be considered

as a successor to D'ARCO for the reason that he is personally

unpossessive of leadership qualities and that he does not

possess the characteristics which would build anyone's confidence

in him.

The PCI also doubts any future for DE TOLVE due to the

fact that he is a nephew of GIANCANA.

MARCI's remark concerning the G guys and his conversation

with one is again to the fact that he was interviewed for the

third time by SAs WILLIAM F. ROEMER and MARSHALL E. RUTLAND

in the chambers of the City Council this week. His recital

of that interview is basically factual, although he was very

courteous and friendly to the Agents.

ROTI's reference to my father, my old man, and BRUNO

is a reference to his father, BRUNO ROTI, now deceased.

BRUNO

occasion in the early 1900's for

Black Hand murders and in those days had the reputation of

being the leader of the "Mafia" in Chicago. It is obvious that

BRUNO ROTI championed the cause of D'ARCO and MARCI in at least

one talk with TONY ACCARDO, who formerly was the leader of

organized criminals in Chicago and who is reserred to above

as "JOE." CHARLIE FITZGERALD is Lt.

CHARLES FATZGERALD. Of .

the Chicago Police Department, who was formerly associated

with the old Scotland Yard Unit which investigated organized

criminals in Chicago..

He is an extremely capable investigator

and although personally he was not well liked by some other.

of his associates no definite information has been obtained

concerning his integrity.

It appears that he may have been

developing BRUNO ROTI and/or FRED ROTI for informational value.

His reference to the LeBistro is to a night club located just

fun-loving Chicago top hoodlum.

MARCI then redeived a telephone call from PHIL

MESI, a Chicago bookmakey and told him that he was going

to the wedding of MICHAEL BRIATTA that evening and would talk

to him there. ROTI and MARCI then continued their conversation:
