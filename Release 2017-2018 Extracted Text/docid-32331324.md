Informant advised that he had gone to see CHARLIE

WHITE and asked him to contact SAM GIANCANA to intercede

for informant against CARLOS MARCELLO, who has let it be

known that he is out to get informant

and his wife because

of the money he owes them, and because he knows that informant's

wife is using her polideal influence to push MARCELLO's

deportation

He related that CHARLIE called someone called

"The Boot" (BOIARDO), and spoke to him in Italian in informant's

presence. Thereafter, CHARLIE told him that as long as he was

on the street he had nothing to worry about, as "The Boot"

would contact GIANCANA to put the word in to lay off.

As a pretext to induce CHARLIE WHITE to do this for

him, informant told him that he would do what he could to

help CHARLTE and his son, CHUCK DEL MONICO, In their present

on, оно bo

difficulties with the law.

on 8/11/66, informant advised he wants to talk to

GIANCANA himself and

to arrange a meeting in NY with GIANCANA

cHUcK told him

GIANCANA would never come to NY, because of recent publicity

about Las Vegas and fears of possibly being

out.

Informant told DEL MONICO that he would be down sometime

after 8/22/66.

ADMINISTRATIVE (Cont'd)

On 8/30/65, MY 5642-C-TE advised SA THOMAS L. COLARELLI

that in his dispute with MARCELLO over the money owed to him by

MARCELLO, he went to CHARLIE WHITE and asked him to explain his

situation to GIANCANA and collect the money for him. Later, he

called off the requeat as he knew that they would want a cut and

he had decided to go after MARCELLO legally in the courts as his

attorney advised him that collection would be no problem.

The first week after Labor Day informant's astorney

is filing a suit against MARCELLO and informant expects that

MARCELLO will have to come to NY in this regard.

Also in this regard, informant called RED PASSARELLI (PB

in Chicago to arrange a meeting with GIANCANA. Informant stated

that PASSARELLI runs the company that distributes Seaburg Juke

Box machines for GIANCANA.

PASSARELLI advised that he would

call CHARLIE WHITE for verification to clear informant for a

neeting with GIANCANA in Chicago.

Informant advised he wants to talk to GIANCANA

personally and explain his situation with MARCELLO. Informanc

learned from PASSAREILI that the Chicago mob is having trouble

with MARCELLO in some of the juke box accounts controlled by

MARCELLO in Louisiana, which are suspected of being short.

Informant still plans to go to Miami and see CHARLIE

WHITE'S son, CHUCK DEL MONICO, because he has other business

interests to attend to there and feels that he can "pump": CHUCK

for any information he may have.

Informant advised that he mistakenly associated

GIANCANA with MARCELLO in Puerto Rico gambling interests when

contacted on 8/18/66, because both have hidden interests in the

Tropicana in Las Vegas, Nevada. He could furnish no specific

hidden interest on GIANCANA's part in the casinos in Puerto

Rico.
