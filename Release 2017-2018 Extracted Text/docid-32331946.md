a photograph of MAZIL HANNA, aka. Daniel Hanna, that she had

never seen him before and has never heard his name mentioned

by LOUIS MARTINEZ.

She said she had no information about him

which would indicate that he was an associate of MARTINEZ.

In regard to the letter postmarked August 11, 1958,

She said the letter had nothing

to do with the issue at hand in this case, namely the theft

of the weapons from the Canton Armory, and she stated she dio

not want to disclose the facts to which she referred in the

letter.

She added that no one that has ever been previously

mentioned by her or to her in this case has anything to do

with the "deal"

that this letter was written far before the date the theft in

instant case was committed.

In regard to MARTINEZ, KRAJCIK stated that from

administration, had reported MARTINEZ as a "phony" and traitor

to CASTRO, thereby causing him to be jailed and charged as

being anti-CASTRO.

got him out of the trouble, and somehow MARTINEZ was able to

raise the money for the hotel bill.
