OTTAWA, Ontario.

Re: John Cesar GROSSI, Aka., Unlawful

Flight to Avoid Civing Testimony

Enquiries have been conducted in Ottawa

through the Department of Immigration where records reveal

that GROSSI was deported from Canada at Black Rock, N.I.,

7 Oct. 59.

At that time subject's occupation was

shown

as

*Habitual

Criminal",

therefore, he has since been barred

from Canada as an undesirable.

2.

We have established that Ottawa Tel. No.

233-1527 is listed to Mrs. Mary A. MURRAI, 78 Fourth Avenue,

Ottawa.

One, Patricia ELLIOTT,

is & resident at this address

and advised our investigator that GROSSI is her uncle.

Edna

(Mrs. William) ELLIOTT,

who has been previously interviewed

in Pembroke, Ont., is Miss ELLIOTT's mother..

Miss ELLIOTI

stated that

she contacts her aunt, Patricia

BOHEN, quite

frequently at Kingston, Ont. However,

she has no knowledge

as to the present whereabouts of GROSSI. We have been

assured that she will advise

our investigator in the event

information of value comes to her attention.
