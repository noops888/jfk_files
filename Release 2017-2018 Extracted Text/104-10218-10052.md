UN HOMBRE-LEYEND

DEcIDIasOS hacer una visiLa rápida al taller de Siqueiros. Con

el riesgo de asentar a las reglas de buen sono, ni siquiera ie

anunciamos por teléfono nuestra visita. Sencillamenie no que-

rianos distracrie de su trabajo un solo momento, no quisinos

proporcionarle las molestias habituales, inevitabies cuando lic-

• gan visitantes, máxime si son extranjeros. Además, el fin de

nuestro viaje era por demis modesto: se trataba de felicitarle.

con motivo del Premio. Lenin de la Paz. 1966 que acalaia de

öbtener.

Nuestro propósito empezó a cumplirse lal y coino lo había-

mos plancado. Salió a recibirnos el maestro, enfundado en su

overol de trabajo lleno de pintura, con su invariable sombrero

de fieltro bastante maltrecho. Era evidente que acababa de

dejar el pincel. De acuerdo a nuestros planes, quisimos darie

un apretón de manos, descarle largos años de vida y grandos

éxitos en su trabajo y marchamos, pero... la cosa no quedo

ahí Siqueiros "interrumpió

nuestro, forrente de clocuencia y

con un ademán que no admitía objcciones nos invitó a entrar

y nos sentó a su mesa, aduciendo que no hay mejor aderezo

a una comida que una charla amena...

Yo he escuchado siempre a Siqueiros con la misma emo-

ción con la que en la infancia icía los cuentos de hadas. La

vida de este hombre, participe activo de todos los aconteci-

mientos políticos de la vida de México en los últimos 50 años,

uno úe los fundadores y dcfensores consecuentes de la escucia

del muralismo es, diría jo, más que una leyenda: es una coloc-

ción de leyendas sobre la variedad infinita de formas de lucha

del bien y

del mal. El hecho de haber recibido el Premio

Lenin de la Paz. la conmovido y emocionado a Siqueinos. Re-

- cuerda cómo a comienzos de nuestro siglo la actividad de los

pequeños grupos de pacifistas suscitaba las burlas y punzadas

sarcárticas de la sociedad "juiciosa", cómo después la lucha

por la par. fue declarada cunpaña propagandistica de los So

viels y cómo ahora la exigencia de la paz se ha hecho gencral

en el

murido entero. Me alegra -dice, el pintor-

si mis

esfuerzos en esta lucha de toda la humanidad por la felicidad

ban resultado lo suficientemente notorios para haber sido dis

tinguidos con el Preinio de la •Paz.-

A la pregunta de si responden a la realidad las infonna-

ciones de la prensa en el sentido de que la concedido la par-

te monciaria del Premio (más de 300,000 pesos mexicanos)

al pueblo de Viciram, Siguciros contesia que c'ecuvamenie

ha enviado un teicgrama al gobierno de la República Demo

crática de Victnam, anunciando.su. decisión de entregar este

dincro al puchlo de Victnam en lucha heroica contra la agre-

sión extranjera. No pongo ningunas condiciones para que gas

ten esta suma -dice Siqueiros- los vietnamitas pueden utilizar-

la como mejor les plazca y en lo que más nocesiico. De la misma

manera que cualquier ciudadano honrado cuando va por la

ma mancra yo me considero obligado a prestar en la medida de

mis posibilidades mi ayuda concreta al pueblo de Vietnam.

Que mi premio sirva para menguar los suírimientos del pue

blo y contribuya a restablecer la paz en esla suírida región de

nurstro planera.

En la casa estudio de Siqueiros no se puede dejar de pregun

tarle acerca de su trabajo en la Sirlna. Tampoco nosotros pudi-

mos evitar la tentación y nos enteramos que los planes de la

composición han ido cambiando considerablemente. En primer

lugar, todo el trabajo, a voluntad del cliente, del autor y para

airgria del publico, será trasladado a la capital, a la ciudad

de México; antes estaba previsto que quedar. en Cuernavaca.

Para la compasición se está construyendo en el parque de la

Lama una espaciosa sala destinada a congresos, representa-

ciones icatrales y oiros aclos púbicos. A dilerencia del pro

yecio del primer edificio, el nuero loral en vez de reclanguiar

tendrá la forma de un octaedro, lo cual repercutirá en la pla-

nificación de la composición en su conjunto: en el encuentro

de los ángulos habrá que añadir nuevos cienentos de enlace.

pintor ha modificado totalmente también el plan inicial de la

composición. Antes pensaba realizar todos los fragmentos-blo

ques pintados, ahora lo rehace lodo en un nuevo género que

el llama "escuitopintura". Se trata de que un mismo fragmento

de la composición contice al mismo

tiempo

clementos de

pintura, bajorrelieve y escultura Siqueiros considera que esta

forma artística es la más expresiva y asequible

Los clementos escultóricos y los bajorrelieves se hacen de

rictal forjado que después se estañan y se pintan. Por eso

ahora en el taller del maestro se escucha no sólo el ruido de

los mótores cléctricos que levantan y transportan enormes bio-

rues de cemento, sino también el estrépiio de los martilios y

el chirriar del metal cortado. En el

taller el trabajo no se

interrumpe de sol a sol: la composición deberá inaugurarse

en 1963 para los Juegos Olimpicos y será una de las cosas

dignas de verse en la ciudad de México.

Preguntamos qué será del edificio que está ya casi tenni-

nado en Cuernavaca y que estaba destinado inicialmente para

la Sixtina. Siqueiros nos

dice con una sonrisa que si tiene

úcipo y salud piensa pintar para csa galería 200 retralos

de los representantes más relevantes de la humanidad. Y

• añade enseguida que entre eilos figurarán naturalnente Alarx

y Lenin. Aunque no es cosà de mañana, será la ciapa siguiente

plancada por el gran pintor.

Ya al despedirse, Siqueiros nos piùe que transmitamos sus

saludos a lodos los amigos que tiene en la Unión Soviética,

con quienes piensa encontrarse en noviembre de 1957 cuando

vaya a Míoscú a los festejos que se celebrarán con motivo del

50 aniversario de la victoria de la Gran Revolución Socialis-
