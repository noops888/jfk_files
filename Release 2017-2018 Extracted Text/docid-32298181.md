The "New York Dally News" final edition, December 30, 1958, page 3,

carried an article captioned

"Held For Jury in Pinball Sale.

charged with Grand Larceny for allegedly

selling pinball machines he did not own, outright.

It mentioned that

the complainant was SEYMOUR TEPPER, of Long Beach, Long Islana.

S and S Distributing Company, New Kensington, Pa. (Possible purchase

of stolen cigarettes))

PG I-4, who has furnished reliable information in the past, on

January 6, 19592

positively identified a photograph of PHILIP JAMES

MAINER,

FBI # 868314A, and furnished the following information

concerning him:

Approximately 18 or 20 months ago PG T-4 received a telephone call

from HENRY ABRAHAM, aka "РЕСКУ,

operator of a cocktail lounge

in New Kensington.

ABRAHAM told PG T-4 that he had a deal that

PG T-4 might be interested in and asked him to come to his place of

business right away.

When PG T-4 arrived at "PECKY's" place he was

Introduced to two individuals, one a Syrian man age about 40-45, name

unknown, from New Castle or Farrell, Pa., and the other MAINER,

although

MAINER was not introduced to PG I-4 by name:

ABRAHAM told PG T-4

that the Syrian man was a very good friend of his and had 1800

cartons of stolen cigarettes in a station wagon parked outside that he

would sell for $1.00 a carton.

he wanted to buy the entire load himself but did not have enough money

the entire loa nine

PG T-4 advised that ABRAHAM said that

to swing the deal, and encouraged PG T-4 to put up half the money so

they could buy the load together.

PG. T-4 refused and suggested to ABRAHAM that they take the cigarettes

to GABRIEL MANNARINO, owner of the S and S Distributing Company, a

cigarette vending machine concern.

In the presence of PG I-4, ABRAHAM told the Syrian man and MAINER

that if PG I-4 would not put up any money he was not in a position

to take the load himself but offered to take them to MANNARINO in his

own car. ABRAHAM left with the two individuals and looked up GABRIEL

MANNARINO who presumably bought the entire stolen shipment.
