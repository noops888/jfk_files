U@Mr. JOHN TOPPING, Head of the Political Section of

lasshy

Ethe Embassy,

stated he agrees with the Madrid Legal Attache's

opinion that MAX FERRER" mentioned by Lt. Colonel EMILIC

DELGADO is probably identical with the subject inasmuch as

backgrounds of both individuals are so similar.&

Elaborating on the enclosed despatch, Mr. TOPPING

stated, that while in Spain subject was the Assistant to

MARTI, famous French communist who took part in the

Spatish Civil War:

• Mr. TOPPING stated that the subject is

SOCARRAS.

Concerning subject's communist feelings,

TOPPING

said it has been the opinion of the Embassy political reporters

that subject is more of a pure communist than the present leaders

of the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP, Cuban Communist Party),

that he was pro-Browder, and that he probably has

not changed

his views on communism. (*)U)

Mr. TOPPING added that subject is best described

as a bandit

and gangster and that he has a private army of

between 300 and 500 men composed of hoodlums who.

kidnapings, blacknail, and robberies uncontrolled arry out

3

are armed and clothed by the Cuban military

of BATISTA.
