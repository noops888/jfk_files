CUBELA, ON HIS LAST TRIP TO SPAIN, THE SILENCER AND THE TELESCOPIC

SIGHT. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HIS DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT AND THE RELA-

ON HIS WAY THROUGH SPAIN ON HIS RETURN TRIP TO CUBA, CUBELA

REQUESTED FROM BICHE BERNAL 10,000 PESOS FOR THE WORK HE WAS TO DO

IN CUBA IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLOT. BICHE BERNAL GAVE HIM, INSTEAD

ON THE BLACK MARKET, CUBELA COULD BE OBTAIN THE SUM OF MONEY REQUIRED.

UNFORESEEN EVENTS OCCURRED FOR TIE PLOTTERS. WHEN THE

SERIOUSNESS OF THE STEPS TAKEN BY CUBELA WERE STILL UNKNOWN-

ALTHOUGH THERE WERE STRONG INDICATIONS THAT A CRIMINAL AND TREACHER-

OUS PLAN WAS BEING PREPARED & AGAINST HIS PERSON--COMRADE PIDEL

CASTRO SUMMONED CUBELA.

HE SPOKE TO HIM FOR SEVERAL HOURS, AND

URGED HIM NOT TO BE CONVERTED INTO AN INSTRULENT OF THE ENEMIES OF

THE REVOLUTION AND THE COUNTRY. FIDEL ALSO TOLD CUBELA THAT BECAUSE

OF CUBELA'S UNSTABLE CHARACTER, HIS FONDNESS FOR AN EASY LIFE, AND

HIS LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE PROBLEMS AND THE STRUGGLES OF THE

PEOPLE, CUBELA ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS INCREASING ISOLATION

OUTSIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS. SUT, FIDEL TOLD HIM, IF HE

REALLY WOULD CORRECT THIS AND WAS READY TO DEVOTE HIMSELF

SERIOUSLY TO ANY ACTIVITY IN THE MANY FIELDS IN WHICH THE REVOLU

TION PURSUES ITS WORK, WE MOULD ALL BE READY TO HELD HIM.

WEEN THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE, IT WAS NOT KNOWN THAT

MONTHS AGO CUBELA HAD MADE A PACT WITH MANUEL. ARTIME, # NO LESS,

IN A MADRID APARTIENT TO ASSASSINATE THE MAN WHO WAS TALKING TO HIM
