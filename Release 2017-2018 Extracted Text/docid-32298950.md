him for a $200.00 commission.

I-9 said that SCALCO said these rings

were of a cheap novelty type and that he would not be interested in

the proposition.

I-I said that he heard from SCALCO that PERALTA told SCALCO

he could be reached in care of Concordia 459, Havana, Cuba, and that

FERNANDEZ indicated he could be reached in care of his father at Vapor

lII 57, Havana.

He learned from SCALCO that SCALCO had not heard from FERNANDEZ

or PERALTA in at least six or seven weeks and that SCALCO felt that

they were not engaged in a bona fide attempt to execute a revolutionary

plot against the Batista Government, that they had been unable to obtain

any support from the PRIO people concerning their scheme.

I-g said that,

as a matter of fact, on their March 19 trip to Miami PERALTA and FERNANDEZ

disclosed to SCALCO that, SANCHEZ ARANGO would help them and that they

had some people in Cuba who would assist them in their revolutionary. ef

forts but that on their second trip to Miami FERNANDEZ told SCALCO that

he felt President PRIO was, not at all interested.

With regard to EDWARD WILLIAM MURPHY, T-9 reported that SCALCO

had first met MURPHY about two or two and a half years ago through a

boat owner, THOFILO BABUN, owner of the "Nevera" which travels between

Santiago, Cuba and Miami.

T-9 said that in about the middle of April,

1952, while SCALCO was making a business call to the Auto Marine Engine

Company, 3464 Northwest North River Drive, Miami, in company with

FERNANDEZ whose presence was merely incidental, he again saw MURPHY.

On this occasion SCALCO left FERNANDEZ in front of the Auto Marine Engine

Company while he went to look at a boat. When SCALCO returned to, the

front of the building he found FERNANDEZ and MURPHY talking in MURPHY®S

automobile. When SCALCO remarked that he did not know MURPHY and FER-

NANDEZ were acquainted, FERNANDEZ explained he had once helped MURPHY

useful"!.. I-I said that SCALOO did not again see MURPHY and did not know

whether MURPHY had any further dealings, with FERNANDEZ:

It appears that JOSE FERNANDEZ is undoubtedly identical with

the Cuban whom MURPHY met under similar circumstances as described by

Too above.

PETER SCALCO, was born May 19, 1917, at Baracoa, Oriente, Cuba, and

that he has been in and out of the United States since about 1935.

on January 16, 1951, he filed a Declaration of Intention to become a

United States Citizen.

His last reentry into the United States fron

Cuba was on May 25, 1951, according to his file:

Miami Informant T-10, of known reliability,

who is well informed concerning Cuban activities

in the Miami area.

On June 6, 1952, I-10 reported he had received various rumors

of an alleged attempt to overthrow the new Batista Government but that

he had received no specific evidence to support these rumors. He said

he has heard that CARLOS PRIO favors waiting for the 1953 Cuban elections

in order to sweep BATISTA out of office, but that SANCHEZ ARANGO favors

revolutionary action and may have persuaded PRIO to this view.

T-10 recalled that in 1948 the Prio Party in Cuba was furnish-

ing aid to JOSE FIGUEREZ to overthrow the Costa Rican Government and

were shipping arms to FIGUEREZ.

T-10 said that he had heard that when

PRIO fled Cuba on March 10, 1952, he first went to Mexico City where he

was approached by Cuban and Mexican gangsters who tried to shake him down

and consequently PRIO flew to Miami for refuge.

He said it was rumored

in Miami that PRIO had $20,000,000.00 in suitcases brought in from Cuba

at some time during the recent past. He said, however. he had received

no evidence that PRIO had actually purchased any arms or munitions in the

United States, and he expressed the belief that the PRIO party already

had. enough arms and munitions hidden out on various farms in Cuba for

use in the event of any revolutionary action.

X (И)

He said that when the Prio Government came into power in Cuba,

PILIM MENDOZA, Who had been a close friend of GREGORIOUSIMONOVICH, a

notorious smuggler of Pussian origin operating in Cuba, 'got in contact

with PRIO and secured government protection for an illegal export and

import business in order to avoid paying duty. I-10 said that PILIM

represented the Honduras Airlines in Cuba as an agent and that he had

who had made a fartune in smuggling. He said FRANCISCO PRIO was also

a close personal friend of "LUCKY"LUCLANO, the narcotics king who is

now residing in Italy, and that FRANCISCO has a Cuban police record for

dealine in narcotics, bribery and load chocks. su

With regard to ANTONIO PRIO, I-10 said this man worked for

years at the Gelats Bank of Havana prior to the Prio Government where

he had been suspected of dealing in illicit foreign funds during World

War II.

With regard to SANCHEZ ARANGO, T-10 reported that around 1931

or 1932 during the Machado Government, ARANGO was one of the heads of

the Liga Juvenile Communists (Communist Youth Organization), in Cuba, End

that in 1931 ARANGO and several of his companions in this organization

served a jail sentence for disturbing the peace..

.T-10 advised that

SANCHEZ ARANGO has. a number of key men and friends in Guatemala from

whom he might possibly seek aid and support in a revolutionary attempt

against BATISTA. T-10 named these individuals as:

SANCHEZ, ARANGO was then in New York City, this information having been

Re :,

AURET, IANO SANCHEZ I ARANGO

I-II, previously mentioned, possessed a file reflecting

that

SANCHEZ ARANGO arrived in the United States March 17, 1952, from Mexico,

accompanied by former President CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS and was admitted

to the United States under Section 3(2) as a political refugee.

On

May I, 1952: he departed from Miami accompanied by RAUL RODRIGUEZ

SANTOS destined to Vassau in a privately owned single engine plane pi-

loted by EDWARD WILLIAM MURPHY, a convicted alien smuggler. On May 2,

1952; infomation, was received that they headed for Caïcos Islands, and

it was believed SANCHEZ, ARANGO and RODRIGUEZ SANTOS were landed at or

about Santiago on May 3, 1952, MURPHY having réturned to the United

States unaccompanied.

On May 7, 1952, a district-wile look-out was placed by the

Immigration and Naturalization Service against SANCHEZ ARANGO. Should

he again apply for admission to the United States he will be questioned

as to his admissibility under the Act of October 16, 1918, as Amended

and 8CFR174•

The file contained a memorandum emanating from Cuba dated

September 6, 1951, advising that SANCHEZ ARANGO is not a member of the

Partido Socialista Popular and does not. vote other than as a member of

the Partido: Revoluntionaria Cubano (Autentico Party,); that sometimes

he appears to be pro-Communist and

sometimes anti-Communist. He was born

at Havana, Cuba, June 7, 1907, and was appointed Minister of Education

by PRIO in 1948.

He is reported to be the closest friend and advisor

Of PRIO, this relationship existing since student days. Shortly after

taking office as Minister of Education he appointed the following active

Communists to positions within the Ministry of Education:

SANCHEZ ARANGO is reported to be on good terms with various

other leading Communists. He has been jailed and exiled on various oc-

casions for political reasons, in the United States, Spain, Mexico,

Guatemala and Honduras.

He is a close acquaintance of RAUL OSQUEDA, Guatemalan Minister

to Cuba, and former Minister of Education in Guatemala, and a Conmunist.

SANCHEZ ARANGO flies in his personal plane to Guatemalà to

consult with OSQUEDA and has been accompanied by President PRIO. The

author of this report concluded "it is clear he has managed to steer a

middle course between the Communists and anti-Communist faction, per

forming enough favors to both sides to avoid making bitter enemies. It

is believed that if the power of Communism wanes in Cuba he will become

a strong anti-Communist and if Communism gains control he will emerge

as a pure Marxist."
