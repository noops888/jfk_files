RE: Dallas letter to the Bureau dated 9/6/62.

BY letter to the Bureau dated 12/8/61, the Houston

Office reported that contacts with established sources in

the Houston area at that time failed to reveal any informa-

tion from any source which would indicate the existence of

this organization in the Houston area. This matter has been

discussed with various sources of the Houston Office in

recent months, and these sources continue to report no

Knowledge of this organization being active at Houston.

A review of referenced Dallas letter discloses

a lead for Houston was based on information attributed to

*Former DI 18-S who stated there were individuals sympathetic

to the "Minutemen" in the Houston area. flu,

*It is noted the information attributed to this

former informant is non-specific in nature

and consists of

general statements apparently based on remarks made by

ROBERI DE PUGH of Missour While it is a matter of commor

knowledge that there are numerous individuals in the Houstor

area who are active in ultra-conservative organizations such

as the National Indignation Convention, there has been no

indication any of these individuals have any specific plans

to use force or otherwise engage in violent or illegal

activities.
