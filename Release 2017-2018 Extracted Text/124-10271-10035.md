Our Atlanta Office has advised on 7/15/74, GliS

Howard Gibson, 1746 Hammondwood Circle, Powder Springs,

Georgia, furnished information regarding an alleged wiretap

of the telephone of U. S. Senator Howard Baker at Washington,

D. C. (WDC) .

Gibson is identified as a former Deputy Sheriff

in Cobb County, Georgia, who was forced to resign after he was.

alleged to have fired a gun into the house of a narcotics

informant with whom he had a dispute. Subsequently, Gibson

was employed by a private investigative organization known as

Central Investigative Agency, 6650

Powers Ferry Road, NW,

Atlanta, Georgia.

On 7/11/74, Gibson advised that Central Investigative

Agency maintains a branch office known as Security Consultants

International (SCI) at 1028 Connecticut Avenue, Suite 1109,

NDC..

A portion of the office space leased by SCI was recently

sub-leased to one Lucein Conein (phonetic), allegedly an

official of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) ;

Special Operations Group, WDC. Gibson claims he was the

business partner in the office of the Central Investigative

Agency and in SCI with Mitchell Werbell, III, who resides at

Powder Springs. porgia.

The offices of SCI in WDC, have

been managed by Jonn Muldoon, a retired Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA)

agant.

Gibson suspectallial conéin is actually a covert

CIA agent and further suspects CIA has been operating a

wiretap out of the space leased from SCI.. Gibson bases

these suspicions on statements made by Werbell alleging

that he has worked for CIA in the past; that he is friends

with CIA agents and officials; that he believes Conein to

be an ex-TA agent and knows that john Muldoon is a former

CIA agent:

Long to Gebhardt Memo

Re:

Alleged tapping of telephone of

U.S. Senator Howard Baker

Gibson

advised that during the course of a normal

working day two or three men usually enter and work in the

sub-leased SCI space.

They stay during the course of an

entire day without leaving the space.

and do not seem to

conduct business in a normal manner.

An unidentified

friend of Gibson's overheard individuals in the space,

allegedly leased by DEA, discussing

"tapes."

Based on the

above information and based on Gibson's experience with

wiretapping while employed with the Cobb County, Georgia,

Sheriff's Office, Gibson believes a wiretapping operation

was being conducted in the space allegedly sub-leased by

DEA from SCI.

Since it appeared that an ongoing CIA operation

was being compromised

and that the CIA should be aware,

our Atlanta Office contacted

CIA, Atlanta[ S]

(Covert)

and informed him of the avove on 1/11/74.

On 7/12/74, Gibson furnished the following:

Directly above Suite 1109, rented by SCI at

1028 Connecticut Avenue, is a suite

located on the

twelfth floor, which is utilized as an efficiency apastment.

It is connected to Suite 1109 on the floor below by stairway.

Gibson said the twelfth floor space is actually the space

sub-leased to Conein and that telephone number 785-4514 is

installed in that space.

Conein sub-leased this apartment

in March, 1974, and was

still being used by Conein as

7/5/74.

Regarding the information above concerning the

alleged overhearing of discussions concerning "tapes," by

alleged DEA employees, Gibson advised this information

was furnished to him by Mr. Steve

i: stay van chave

Van Cleave, a personal

Friend of Gibson's and a private investigator from

Atlanta, Georgia.

Van Cleave told Gibson that he

visited SCI offices on a recent unrecalled date. Van Cleave

was told by Werbell that Van Cleave could not stay in the

offices at that time as Werbell was consulting with a

client. Van Cleave told Gibson he then went to the twelfth

floor entryway to SCI offices, the space sub-leased by

Conein, and overheard a conversation through the door
