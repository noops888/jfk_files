Pershingle

PERASIN GERVAIS, PCI

and former investigator for the

Parish of Orleans, advised that GARRISON is obsessed with the

investigation into the assassination.of President KENNEDY.

GERVAIS stated he told GARRISON to forget the matter and he

would not assist GARRISON in the investigation and was not

interested in anything GARRISON was doing in connection with

this investigation. He stated he has no knowledge of what

GARRISON is attempting to prove and the only contact he has

had with the investigation has been a call he received from

DAVID FERRIE. He stated that FERRIE has been trying to get

him, GERVAIS, to arrange an interview with GARRISON, which

he has declined to do.

NO 1309-C advised he has been contacted by LEON

VIVON, Patrolman, New Orleans Police Department, assigned as

investigator to the District Attorney's Office and questioned

re his knowledge of the activities of W. GUY BANISTER (deceased),

former New Orleans private detective and former SAC. of FBI,

Chicago. NO 1309-C advised that IVON was interested in obtain-

ing the

names of former associates of BANISTER in various

Cuban movements with which BANISTER was connected and also

a photograph allegedly taken by JOSEPH NEWBROUGH, private

detective employed by BANISTER, of some jeeps and trucks being

shipped to Cuba. IVON was also attempting

to locate BANISTER'S

files.

Based upon comments made by IVON, it was apparent to

informant that JACK_S. MARTIN.and JOSEPH NEWBROUGH, both former

associates of BANISTER, have

been interviewed.

NO 1309-C advised that in talking with IVON it was

apparent that IVON was attempting to develop facts which would

tend to indicate that a conspiracy orginated in New Orleans

involving Cuban Nationals and OSWALD for the purpose of

assassinating President KENNEDY.

NO 1203-C advised that IVON had in his possession

the Warren Report which reflected an interview in

Dallas by the Warren Commission of a woman by the name of

"GUDO" (PH). This woman was a Cuban Exile with family apparently

living somewhere in Cuba. Informant did not have the actual?

name of the woman. (It is noted that Esquire Magazine, December,
