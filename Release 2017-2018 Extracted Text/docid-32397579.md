: Some Western Visitors

There have also been somc

scientific visitors from Westein

nations whose relations with

China were less hostile than

those of the United States, not-

ably britain, France and Can-

ada. In iccent years such visils

have become rare. However, it

is reported that Dr.

Picite

Chouard, professor of botany ai

The Sorbonne in Paris, has now

received cicarance for a trip.

The sudden opening of China

to visits by American journal-

ists a fes weeks ago has raised

hopes for a bicalidown of the
