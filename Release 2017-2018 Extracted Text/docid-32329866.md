How Influence of

Control Acquired

WILBUR CLARK was a relatively unimportant

gambler in California prior to 1947.

In that

year he came

to Las Vegas where he started construction of

a large hotel

on the "strip,' which is the highway just outside Las Vegas

in the direction of Los Angeles. CLARK formed a corporation

under the name Wilbur Clark, Incorporated, and stock was

issued.

The principals of this corporation were members of

Toward the end

of 1947, construction of the hotel (Desert Inn) was stopped

because of lack of

funds, labor problems, and material

shortages.

In November, 1950, CLARK testified before

the Kefauver Committee at Las

Vegas. He related that progress

on the Desert Inn was virtually stopped from late 1947 to

1949, at which time a man named RODISON brought in KLINEMAN

and DALITZ from Cleveland who arranged to raise money for

completion of the hotel. The Cleveland group acquired

75 per cent ownership, and the remaining 25 per cent was

held by CLARK and some of the original promoters.

The hotel

started operation in April 1950. CLARK became President;

KLINEMAN became Vice President;

and DALITZ became Treasurer.

Informant SU 370-C advised that on

September 10, 1958, CLARK and his Desert Inn associates

took over the hotel portion of the Star Dust Club, which

has more than 1,000 rooms.

The same group also managed

the Royal Nevada Hotel on

October 9, 1958.

The Royal

Nevada Hotel is located adjaceni to

the Star Dust Hotel

and contains about 200 rooms.

The informant said the

Royal Nevada will be operated only as a hotel, without

gambling.

The records of the Nevada State Tax

Commission show that CLARK had a 5 per cent interest in the

Royal Nevada operation.

SU 370-C also advised that CLARK, SAM

TUCKER, and KLINEMAN held a meeting during the week of

October 1, 1958, with a "Pan American group!! At that

time CLARK and his associates sold their interest in the

international gambling casino at the Hotel Nacional in

Cuba®

This informant reported that CLARK and the Desert

Inn group received about $500,000 for that

interest.

With respect to the Star Dust Hotel,

Las Vegas, informant SU 370-C advised the Star Dust had

been promoted by one TONY CORNERO, aka. TONY STRALLA, Who

died

before construction was completed. The venture went

into bankruptcy after his death.

FACTOR permitted the "Chicago Syndicate" (not further

identified) to obtain an interest in the Star Dust, and

that JOHN DREW is handling the interest of the Chicago group.

DREW was described as the casino manager of the Star Dust

and formerly from Chicago.

Informant LA 400-C furnished information

that the events leading up to the control of the Star

,Dust by the Desert Inn had been a prearranged matter.

This informant related that the FACTORS had been chosen

oy the Desert Inn group to hancle the completion of the

Star Dust Club. Informant said the FACTors could have put

up some of the capital, but that full control would have been

retained by the "Cleveland gambling interests."

c. Degree of Influence

Records of

the Gaming Control Board,

Nevada State Tax Commission,

show that CLARK and the

individuals listed under section A above are the owners and

operators of the Desert Inn and

acceptable on the basis of information known at that time.

The Desert Inn is one of a number of

prominent hotel and gambling spots on the "strip" at

been one of the most successful from the standpoint of

popularity.

who acqutred control aty of the owners of the Desert Tan

the Star Dust Hotel, and who.

successfully promote its operation, might be considered

as some degree of influence by this

group.

D. How Influence is Exercised

No information is available that any

unusual exercise of influence by this group has been used.

Since gambling is a legal business in Nevada,

the operation

of the Desert Inn and other similar ventures

is not considered

to be a business front except to the extent of being an

investment of funds which may have been acquired through

gambling in other states where it is considered illegal.

E.

Illegal Methods of Furthering Business

Interests

No information is available at this time

that the Desert Inn group has used violence of any illegal

means to stifle competition or to further their own business

interests in Nevada.

F. Interlocking Influence of Other Areas of

Industries

Informant CL 157-C furnished information

that MORRIS DALITZ and the "Cleveland Syndicate" had financial

interests in a number of enterprises, including the following:

that WORTMAN and his associates at one time had an undisclosed

interest in the California Club, Las Vegas, but evidence

was not sufficient or of the proper type to be used in a

proceeding for revocation of the gambling license of the

California Club. GALLAGHER said information had been

received from a source considered reliable, that the

WORTMAN investmont in the California Club had been

withdrawn.

On March 28, 1958, informant SU 371-C

advised it is that informant's belief that WORTMAN

and

his associates still matatain an undisclosed interest in

the California Club, Las Vegas.

This belief by the informant

is based primarily

on the fact that THOMAS STERLING,

Pit

Boss at the California Club, originally came from East

St. Louis, Illinois where he had worked most of his life

in gambling clubs.

In about June 1958, ARQUILIA sold 60% of

his interest in the California Club to one JAMES P. LONG,

Pit Boss of the Tropicana Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada. The

price was reported to be $435,000, however, ARQUILLA did

not receive the total amount in cash, having accepted

notes payable at a future date.

Las Vegas, Nevada.

The application regarding the New

Frontier Hotel did not materialize and on september 9,

1958, ARQUILLA acquired approximately 50% of the Westerner

Club, 23 Fremont Street, downtown Las Vegas.

According

to WILLIAM GALLAGHER, Nevada State Tax Commission,

ARQUILIA paid approximately $138,000 for this share in the

Westerner Club.

On March 10, 1959, informant SU 396-c advisec

making efforts to dispose of his interest in the Westerner
