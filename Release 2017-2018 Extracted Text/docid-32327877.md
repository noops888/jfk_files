Released under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 USC 2107 Hotej.

DATE: 11-14-2017

NY 92-1108

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Based on information furnished by NY 4336-C-TE

to the effect that SALVATORE GRANELLO has never forgiven

THOMAS EBOLI for authorizing the "hit" on GRANELLO's son,

MICHAEL, in 1968, who was reputedly

dealing in narcotics,

â€¢GRANELLO has been opened as a PC of this office.

GRANELLO

has been openly stating that EBOLI should have shown him

the

respect of at least consulting him prior to authorizing

the

"hit".

The NYO anticipates interviewing GRANELLO to

determine his potential as a C-TE.

The Bureau has been

advised that any interview with GRANELLO should not

jeopardize

the pending WIPDA cases under which GRANELLO is a subject.

The AUSA in the SDNY who is handling these cases has been

contacted and stated he has no objection to GRANELLO being

contacted along thelines as long as the

interview is limited

and does not concern the pending substantive violations.

NY T-2 refered to in the details of this report

is SEYMOUR SISKIND who has been contacted by Buagents and

who is under development as an informant. He has displayed

a cooperative attitude and it is felt that he is in an

excellent position to furnish information regarding GRANELLO'S

activities.

Information copies of this report are being designated

for MM and SJ in view of their interest in this case and since

additional investigation might be requested in those Divisions.
