MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, European Division

ATTENTION:

Mr. Edward Fennimore

SUBJECT:

It. Col. William J. Herliby

1. In accordance with our telephone conversation of

3 November, I am furnishing you the following information about

the Army hearing. The Department of the Army has convened a

board of general officers to review the record of It. Col. Herlihy

to ascertain whether he should be retained in the service in

accordance with statute 10 U.S.C. 3791. One of the bases for

dismiesal from the Army under this provision is the finding by

the board that an Individual officer's retention is not consistent

with the interests of national security.

2. The board is set to bear the case of It. Col. William J.

Herliby at the Headquarters First U. S. Army, Fort Meade,

Maryland, from 26 to 29 January 1970. The Army counsel who

is defending It. Col. Herliby has requested Mr. Peter Bagley to

appear as a witness on behalf of Herlihy. The anticipated testi

mony of Mr. Bagley would cover the following:

That Mr. Bagley had been Interviewed by

military authorities concerning It. Col. Herliby;

b. That the above interview was conducted in

an improper manner;

c. That Mr. Bagley told the investigators Lt.

Col. Herliby never represented himself as a member

of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Lt. Col. Herlihy is that he committed acts not clearly consistent

of the Central Intelligence Agency. There is a classified written

statement signed by Mi. Bagley contained in Lt. Col. Herlihy's

dossier to the effect that, as of March 1968, Lt. Col. Herliby

was not involved in any CIA activities nor performing any functions

in conjunction with members of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Agency to present this document to the Board of Inquiry.

counsel that Mr. Bagley's testimony can be introduced by answering

written interrogatories and not require his personal appearance.
