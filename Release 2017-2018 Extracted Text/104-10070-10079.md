Control

It is evident from his S/W messages that AMFAUNA-1 derives

great personal satisfaction from his work

against the CASTRO regime.

His connection with KUBARK provides him with the means to do this work.

This is believed to be a strong element of control.

There have been

many opportunities to test this control, by ordering AMFAUNA-1 ec do

something or to desist from doing something else, and the control is

believed to be effective.

that all is still well are the fact
