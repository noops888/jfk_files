August 10-17, 1963, and one copy of report of SA James P. Flynn

dated July 1, 1963, at New York and captioned as above.

The Bureau is not in possession of specifie detailed

information on connections between La Cosa Nostra in the

United States and Italy which would be of a type appropriate

to be furnished by Italian police to the Italian Parliamentacy

Anti-Mafia Commission.

With regard to infornation in a category for the sole

use of Italian police in connection with their official investiga-

tion of this organization, in line with Doctor Manopulo's request,

it is believed that data developed regarding Italian national,

Calogero Sinatra will be of interest to them. This pertains to

che travel or sinatra, or vallelunge, Caltanisetta, Italy, to the

United States during the Summer of 1962. It 15 noted that you have

had previous correspondence in connection with Sinatra's travel

to visit Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, racket leader, Angelo Bruno.

Investigation by Bureau Agents determined that Sinatra

arrived from Italy by air at New York International Airport on

June 16, 1962. He was net by Angelo Bruno, Pasquale Massi and

Paul Gambino. Bruno is the "boss" of the Philadelphia "family"

of La Cosa Nostra and is that area's representative on the

"conuission," the top zuling body in this organization. Pasquale

Massi is a veteran member of La Cosa Nostra and operates under

Bruno in Cander, New dersey.

Massi in the past has been known

to travel to Italy and on at least one of these trips was in

contact with Salvatore Lucania, aka Charles "Lucky" Luciano.

Paul Cambino, also a member of this organization,

is the brocher

of his time with Bruno in the Philadelphis area and met with a

number of members of Philadelphia's La Cosa Nostra *family."

Manopulo data with regard to Sinatra's travel to the U. S. and

the fact that he was met by leaders of la Cosa Nostra at the

time of his arrival at International Airport, and in the regular

company of Bruno during the next few months. It will also be

permissible for you to advise Doctor Manopulo, exclusively for

his contidentia, information, that we have received intormation

from a confidential source that Sinatra is a member or capesonce

organization in Italy and very probably holds the position of

"boss, " or "representando," heading & group within La Cosa Nostra

in Sicily. It should be made clear to Doctox Manopulo that this

latter information is uncorroborated by any other source; we are

not in a position to substantiate this data with any forn of

testimony, and, therefore, it is not of a type which should be
