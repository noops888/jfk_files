public relations firm in Washington, D. C. This source further noted

that Julia Cellini was the sister of Dino Cellini who was at one time

connected with gambling casinos in Havana,, Cuba. By Civil Service

gambling, asters

Commission Form 3746, dated August 6, 1965, the Civil Service Com-

mission (CSC) inquired as to whether the identity of this source could

be disclosed. By communication dated August 25, 1965, the FBI advised

the CSC that this source had requested that his identity not be disclosed

and that he had declined to testify under any circumstances in this matter.

By communication dated September 19, 1966, the CSC

advised that Edward Kiper Moss had been dropped from consideration

before determination was completed.

In addition, information has been received from the

Credit Eureau, Inc., Washington, D. C., that during the period of

1953 through 1964, Mr. Moss had numerous tax liens and suits filed

, against him for nonpayment of debts. (65-61021 and 121-39985)

Our files contain no additional pertinent information

concerning Mr. Moss.

Civil fingerprints were located in the files of the FBI

Identification Division which may be identical with those of Edward K.

Moss. These fingerprints were searched through the criminal files

of the Identification Division and no arrest record was located.

Sincerely yours, mat

NOTE: The source who furnished the information alleging that Moss was a

pervert is WF 1086-C, a former Washington gambler who continues to

participate in such activities.
