information before they heard from us and they do not reference

in here the Exhibit 4 which tells them to discontinue the

operation or to not pursue the matter.

This was apparently sent before they had received

Exhibit 4, and their contact in which they had, in which they

had discussed what could be done as a harassment during the

flight, they had discussed this prior to the receipt of our --

of my Exhibit 1.

Mr. Kelley. Does it appear to you that that cable,

Exhibit 5, refers to an assassination or to harassment

and water ditching, and maybe making the trip abort, but

not kill anybody?

Mr.

That would be, that would appear to be

correct.

Mr. Kelley. You testified earlier that the station

in its two earlier cables, I believe

Exhibits 2 and 3,

did not, was not suggesting assassination or looking for

authority to assassinate?

Reading Exhibits 2 and 3 at this point,

that is correct.

Mr. Kelley. And as

Exhibit No. 6 we will mark

a routing and record sheet, form 610 from

dated January 17, 1975, to the Deputy Director for Operations

and the Inspector General, and attached to that is a memorandum
