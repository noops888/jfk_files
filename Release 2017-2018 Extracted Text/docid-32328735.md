and in the Bahamas

We attach two copies of the personal particulars and a brief

note on each of seven refugees who arrived in the Cayman Islands

in an open boat on 27th February, 1962 (Enclosure I) • The boat

was taken back to Cuba.

Also attached (Enclosure II) are two copies of a note containing

the personal particulars of six Cubans who arrived in Nassau on

22nd February, 1962.

It was stated that Rafael REYES Olivero had

been forced by the other five men to take them from Nicaro Bay, Cuba,

in his 50-ft. ferry boat the "CATSKILL". On 30th January they

wrecked on an uninhabited cay in the Bahamas and the vessel was totally

destroyed. On 17th February they were picked up by a Haitian boat

and taken to Ragged Island in the Bahamas.

With the exception of REYES, all the Cubans named on Enclosure II

wish to go to Miami.

REYES wishes to return to his wife and seven

chilaren in Cuba but is afraid of reprisals by the Cuban Government.

The escapees gave as their reasons for leaving Cuba that the Cuban

Government was bad and was causing starvation, and one man said he

left because of' "starvation and Communism".

He had previously served

with CASTRO's army as a radio technician.

Then above Information and notes have been forwarded by our offic

in Jamaica as of possible interest to you in view of the fact that

a number of these cubans wish to come

to the United States.
