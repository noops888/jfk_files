COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

do i track

As the Bureau is aware, the NYO expended

member source in the BONANNO

considerable effort to develop migra,

a live

of LCN.

During the early part of his development he

k furnished information of considerable value to the Bureau.

During this time informant had a personal problem involving

whis father which was capitalized on in his development and

which resulted in SA RICHARD A. ANDERSON being able to

develop an extremely close relationship with him. SA ANDERSON,

playing on this problem in a sympathetic manner, was able to

completely gain the confidence of this LCN member, who is

extremely suspicious of all law enforcement officers.

Following the partial resolution of this relative's

problem and the transfer of sA ANDERSon to Minneapolis,

informant has been extremely difficult to harde 1dlz1

-2026

As the Bureau is aware,

REGe InFormant is

and has been for some time in a

state of flux. The NYO feels

that the time is appropriate to capitalize on this state of

flux in which informant may lose his standing in the 'family".

It is felt that the same approach which was initially made

should be repeated in an effort to reconfirm the informant

in the Bureau's service.
