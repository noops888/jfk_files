ADMINISTRATIVE:

ALL OFFICES

MI 623-C-TE has supplied information which alleged

that a high-level meeting of

"La Cosa Nostra" members was

scheduled to take place at the farm of SAM "Teets" BATTAGLIA'

located at Pingree Grove, Illinois, on 8,2/04.

This meeting

was postponed, according

to the informant, and rescheduled for

sometime in October, 1964. All offices should be alert for

any information within their respective territories which would

indicate 'travel plans of known members to the Chicago area

during October, 1964. Such information should be given

priority attention and immediately disseminated to the Bureau

and appropriate offices.

For purpose of brevity in the preparation of the

details of this report, information received from reporting

offices has been summarized in many instances.

Where

Information was attributed to a member of "La

Cosa Nostra"

or a highly confidential source, that information was given

priority of selection.

The name "La Cosa Nostra" is not necessarily binding

as a requisite to the existence of an organization in a given

city having a common origin with the "Mafia". However, in

order to qualify an organization as belonging to the same

criminal conspiracy as "La Cosa Nostra"

", certain common

requisites have been found to be necessary within.the

organization.

The requisite of Italian parentage for admission to

membership appears without exception.

Knowledge of and

obedience to the rules of the

"commission" are binding on all

members. In addition, the requirement that introductions

can be performed only by a third party member is apparently

rigidly observed.

Fringe organizations in various citles which are

composed of Italian and non-Italian members do not qualify

on the basis of similar initiation vites and a common

purpose of criminal endeavor. Member sources or highly

confidential sources rencoting the discussions of members

are knowleageare, or the inost part, of the basic parlance

and terms we now associate with

"La Cosa Nostra"

An example

which illustrates the continity of this knowledge by member

sources is illustrated in the information reported by MI 623-C-TE

of the Milwaukee Office and set forth in the details of this

report.

Each office should continue to direct its efforts

toward the objective of developing nember and highly confidential

sources within the organization known as "La Cosa Nostra"

It is noted that more than one I symbol was used to

cover the same informant in several instences during the

preparation of this report.

This was done to further conceal

the identity of the informants as the source of information.

• NY I-I has advised in April and May, 1964, that

the lollowing qualifications for membership are necessary be-

fore a candidate is acceptable in the Milwaukee "outfit."

Qualifications for Membership

originally prompt ave ember stillan, but tan limatation"

is no longer in effect.

It is not necessary for the prospective member to

commit murder on behalf of the organization.

At times this

was a qualification.

Some recently made" members may have

qualified by the murder of ANTHONY J. BIERNAT in January,

1963, according to the informant.

The candidate is proposed for membership by another

member who likes him, may have worked with him in criminal

activities, and knows his potential. In the past, each

member of the family was asked personally if he had any

objection to the candidate, and a "blackball" would eliminate

him from consideration.

All members are not consulted today;

the decision to admit a member is made by a few leaders.

The candidate must never have cooperated with law

enforcement officers.

In the past the candidate

initiation ceremon; during a

„was inducted in an

"tourna", or general membership

meeting, at which attendance by all members was compulsory.

This tradition is not followed today.

Two initiation ceremonies were held in the past

which followed neither the old tradition of polling membership

for possible objection or the tradition of conducting the

initiation at a general meeting of the membership.

February or March, 1963, at the home of JOSEPH BALISTRIERI,

father of the boss, FRANK BALISTRIERI, an initiation was

conducted of STEVE DE SALVO and PETER

BALISTRIERI in the

presence of only a few members.. A month later, in the basement

murder.)

Initiation Rites

The fingers of the candidate and his sponsor are

pricked and blood mixed as a sign of brotherhood, hands of

all are joined in a circle, a saint's picture is

burned, and

an oath taken in Italian that the member will obey the orders

of his leaders and will place the welfare of the organization

above anything else, including family or religion.

I-. said he was not familiar with any system

of choosing a sponsor at an initiation through the procedure

• of having pérsons in a circle extend fingers in any number

from one to five, taking a count, and

then using this number

in counting around the circle to

pick the sponsoi.

this system has been used on occasion to select a man to

take part in a "hit."

obilgations of Membership

orders of the boss must be followed under the

penalty of death for fallure to obey.

Members must not traffic in narcotics under penalty

of death.

Members

must obtain the consent of their leaders

before they engage in any activity which might affect another

member.

Thus, he must consult with his leader before

engaging in any criminal activity or hefore engaging in any

business, since

these might conceivably affect another

member.
