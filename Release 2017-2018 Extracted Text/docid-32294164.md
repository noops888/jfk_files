s17 month leave of absence from his official duties, rad which

will enable him to devote full time to work as a "coordinator"

for ELC.

The informant was unaware of the nature or scope

of Betancourt's duties as "coordinator". Despite the fact

that Betancourt is, or shortly will be, on leave of absence

from the PAU, he will receive income:..

for
