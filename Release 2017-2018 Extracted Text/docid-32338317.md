17.

The subject has been involved in an alleged

kidnapping, an assault and possibly espionage activities

while in Washington, D. C., which have been previously

reported to the Bureau.

The tesur was instituted to broaden

our coverage of his activities.

Specifically, following the

break in diplomatic relations

between the United States and

Cuba and prior to the discontinuance of WF 1133-S* it was

reported by that informant that the subject and the Cuban

OAS Mission in Washington, D. C., would be used as the

contact point for communications between various July 26

Movement groups and Havana, Cuba, possibly for espionage

purposes.

Since the source is in a position to furnish

valuable information which could not be obtained elsewhere

and in order for the Bureau to be able to fulfill its

responsibilities in the security field, it is recommended

that the coverage be continued for another 30 days,

to afford

a fair evaluation of this source.

At that time, this matter

will be re-evaluated and appropriate recommendations

will be

submitted.
