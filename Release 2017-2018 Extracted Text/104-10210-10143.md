RITS IS VERY INPORTANT AND MOR A BAD JOKE!

25/11-53.

The Fresident of the United States of America, Jonn i kennedy was

assassinated by Lee A Oswald by direct order of the governent of

the Peoples Republic of Chins. Ice H Oswald executed the act alone

but there was helpers and reserv. "Now all is over" was password

to his customers: Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but he

must assassinate Kennedy. Ve etablised contact with Oswald already

when be was in Sowiet but then to try to get hin as a spy for China.

Later he was spy for us. When Lee il Oswald had returned fo USA we

courabled him aner dod Ireshened up his mini "you have been a spy

for us*

and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Now we had him. He got his last informution in lexico. /It was not

good to assassinate kennedy in lexico/ "Pair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as

ssassinated. Our government thought that USA should atteck Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion was behind the: assassin

ation. Then Cuba was attacked by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend

himself. It that was so it would burden..Sowiet that Oswald had visi

ted. He should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ast them for a

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. He and Sowiet should

win this war and whole the world should be Commnistic. Then we should

assassinate Krustjev and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader

of the NEY WORD. When this letter will reach you they have maked

away with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled

Irom our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is a (hinese spy-shool.

ly name is Ryo Liang Yüan. Officer in the department for State-secret.

If you do not belive this letter explain our hate to USA.
