Of AMRIFT-1; performed pre-

text investigations in an effort to determine the residence, of a

key LIMERICK staffer; and successfully recrited the subject of

MEXI-2315 (dated 19 January 1965) which enabled the Station to

achieve a major technical penetration

of the PBRUMEN Embassy in

Mexico City (see also MEXI-2235 datedl. 20 January 1965, for

additional details).

SCANTLING's extremely professional performance

in this recruitment and the subsequent ticklish agent-handling of

the subject is to be commended.

c) LIMITED

As noted in paragraph 2, Section b of Reference, the LIMITED

photographic, surveillance,

and radio dispatching activities were

suspended in

late September 1964 due to the release of LIMITED

photographs in the Warren Commission's overt report. i The Station

subsequently acquired an apartment in the immediate veeinity of

the LIMERICK installation and moved the LIMITED basehouse keepers,

LIIMPTY-6 and LIEMPTY-?, into this temporary location.

operational activities were then re-initiated from the new basehouse

in early January 1965 and during that month LIMITED produced 18 rolls

of 35 mm operational film, provided regular physical

LILYRIC - Throughout the periol under review, the LILYRIC installation

continued to provide photographic and fixed visual surveillance of the

front of the LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC provided 63 rolls of

operational photograpis during this period which were of definite

value to the Stations KUDESK operations ageinst the LIMERICK target.

LILYRIC made specific contributions to the Station's LIOYSTER-I

operation, as noted in MEXI-1173 of 4 November 1954.

LICALLA - During the period inder review, the LICALLA installation

provided coverage of the back of the LIMERICK installation, the

sarden, and patio area where many of the personnel congregate.

•4. SECURITY AND PROBLEMS.

a) During the period under review, there have been no known incidents

which adversely effected the security of Project LIE PTY.

However; as

cautionary measure, the LIENIRAP photographic unit was repainted (a basic color

change) in January 1965. It is belioved that this action will increase the

security of the LIENTRAP unit and allow it to again operate in various areas

where it had been used extensively in the past.

b) There have been no major operational, personnel, or administrative

problems in this Project during the reporting period.
