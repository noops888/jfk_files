With respect to various CP mailing lists which r

JOHN STANFORD has compiled, or helped to compile, within the

past few years, it is to be noted

that these lists have

contained several hundred names of individuals.:

It is

believed that the great majority of these individuals do

not have knowledge that their names are on this list, have

not given their consent to having their names on this list,

and, in all probability, would not agree with the aims

and

purposes of the Comnunist Party.

JOHN STANFORD was

recently In possession of such a Communist Party mailing list

and commented that

that dist includes certain law enforcement

agencies.
