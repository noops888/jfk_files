BRIEFING FOR MR. ROBERT KENNEDY

Concerning the status of D0D plans ar

activities to date - our first completed

action was to obtain a DOD/UCS position

as to the military's stake and proposed

role in the ousting of the Castro Communi

regime. Basically, the policy refelcted

in this paper establishes that the milita

will support State and ClA as necessary

during the preparatory phase of Operation

Mongoose in terms of supplies, transporta-

tion, personnel and bases. It also

establishes the point that the military

believe the continued existence of the

Castro Communist regime is incompatible

with the minimum security requirements

of the United States and the entire

Western Hemisphere. It further makes

the point that the military could inter-

vene overtly in Cuba without serious

offense to national or world public

opinion if:

a. We moved in response to a

humanitarian requirement to restore

order within cuba;

b. If we announced incident to

restore order and hold free elections;

and that we would withdraw from Cuba

as soon as the new government advised

that they had he capability to main-

tain order without further assistance

from OAS nations;

c. If the operation was conducted

as quickly as possible and with suf-

ficient force so that the Communist

-

Bloc's ability to take effective

counter-measures was reduced to the

minimum.

We feel voy strongly that without

damage to their international position

and simply by making the decision to do

so, the Soviets can take a page from our

book and establish an overseas military

base or bases in Cuba. This wauld

to meet this threat from the south.

It

would also provide the Communists with

a secure base for espionage, sabotage

and subversion throughout the entire

Western Hemisphere.

The Soviets have an option on which

they can foreclose at any time. They cai

make the decision to establish military

bases in Cuba at their will and pleasure

and if they exercise this option, we

would likely be unable to remove them

without initiating World War 11l. Con-

sequently, we feel it is mandatory that

face the facts squarely now, and determi

as early as possible whether we can rid

Cuba of Communism by covert support of

Cubans within Cuba; and it is equally

т.

mandatory, for logistic and planning

purposes, that we have an early decisior

as to whether we definitely intend to

use military force, if covert means fai:

We also feel strongly that the Uniter

States should intervene

essential to the establishment of a

friendly Cuban government if they are

in danger of being exterminated by a

widespread Hungarian type blood purge.

In furtherance of the DOD/JCS policy

that any military intervention should be

conducted as quickly as possible, and

with sufficient force to minimize the

Communist Bloc's capability to react, we

are working with CINCLANT in attempting

to reduce the reaction time of his con-

tingency plans for moving into cuba,

and at the same time to beef up his capa

bility so that there will be no doubt

as to the US ability to move in and

opposition we may meet.

CINCLANT is planning to reduce these

This planning effor

should soon provides a basis for deci-

..........

sion concerning the extent we wish to go

in prepositioning without endangering

security and the element of surprise to

an unacceptable degree.

We feel that there is an alarming laci

of appreciation that time is running out

that we cannot let this operation drag

on for an indefinite number of years,

hoping to develop a massive resistance

capability within Cuba. We are concerner

that the new proposal de-emphasizes the

time factor by waiting until July before

what to do next.

This would permit the Soviets (Communist

close on the options open to them, viz.,

entry of Cuba into the Warsaw Pact, and/

or the establishment of Soviet bases in

Cuba. Either one of these actions would
