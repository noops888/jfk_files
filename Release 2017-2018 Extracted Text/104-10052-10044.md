Background on Mexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1.

Unilateral coverage.

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

April 1947) (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Same

exploit leads from the Seviet Fmbassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail Intercept operation.

a. Thone taps were placed,

ratingot in seates.

who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines

tapped was i tried oar

by availability of a listering post nearby

(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, ete) transcribers. Generally

these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

Three photo sites were handled by Arderson with the help

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY ISD

people checking the best type of carera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance.

The Soviet gate was on the

Northl'est corner.of their compound and LIMITED

was diagorally

across a double barrelled street on the Southeast

that block. LIMITED was

the first base and it operaied strictly on an

ex erinentel basis

in the early stages.

I think the lexi Station bought

one storey

this property. (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the choto of "uniden man" was being released to the

puolic by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were noved to another apt

neerby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South.. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Embassy. The agents in LIMITED

and LILYRIC (both

Mexican fanilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented

apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound

which the Mexico Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using

LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet tine vere largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

(Pamon Alvarez) (Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elecentary level at

to accumulate, the inside CO (lahoney) becane disgusted and took the film out

for Ramon's orather-in-law to process

(probably early 1959). Thus Ramon became

the handler for all three photo

bases.

co Mobile surveillance was developed by Anderson and later placed

• under Mahoney and Joseph Sancho. This tean consisted of a half

dozen or so agents who used three to four late model cars and a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera e).

The plan was to activate this group by radio (fron LINTTED 3ASE)

when someone of interest left the imbassy gate and stay with them

until they made their meetings.. These agents knew about the LEITED

BASE bedause they had LINITED photos for identification purçoses..

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)

When

one of the surveillance agents

got too close to his target and

was arrested by the Mexican transit police and turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service. By the time the Station could arrarge through

a cleared attorney to bail him out

the agent had identified Sancho (who was

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside

phone number of Mahoney (who was subsequently replaced by Louls

Fuckett): As a result of this flap, the LIFRAT project was broken

up into several others. The agents were not changed but were given

However,

as I recall,

connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 Iugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live

monitor who made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.I. (passed by Flick to Goodpasture

to get to Scott before 9 a.I., Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed ard passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so.: Those transcripts which had

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

Pussian conversations among the embers of the Soviet Erbassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by

one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may

have been

carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

The Cuban

I am certain that the Osvald call came to our attention fron the

Soviet line. It was picked u; and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused

by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

Scott could read only those two languages and he personally screened the
