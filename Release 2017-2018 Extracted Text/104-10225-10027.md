INIERNAIIONAL CRITICISH OF CHILEAN JUNIA AND MORE RECENTLY OF

BKHERALD HAVE BEEN ORCHESTRATED TO DRAMATIC PROPORTIONS. HOS BELIEVES

EFFECTIVE EXPLOITATION OF GENERAL PINOCHET'S OFFER TO EXCHANGE A

NUMBER OF POLITICAL PRISONERS FOR AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SOVIET AND/OR

CUBAN PRISONERS IS OPPORTUNITY TO BLUNT HOSTILE PROPAGANDA. IF THE

USSR AND CHILE CAN BE LUMPED TOGETHER IN POPULAR MIND AS EACH HAVING

FOLITICAL PRISO:ERS, THE SITUATION CAN BE EXPLOITED TO DIVERT SOME OF

ATTENTION FROM JUNTA'S SUPPOSED MISDEEDS TO SOVIET HANDLING OF

POLITICAL PRISONERS. A REPORT FROM A SENSITIVE SOURCE INDICATES THAT

THE SOVIETS AND CUBANS ARE CONCERNED OVER THE PRESSURES THAT COULD

DEVELOP FROM THE OFFER. Y

2- THE EXCHANGE OFFER HAS ASPECTS THAT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO

NUMEROUS GROUPS IN EUROPE BUT THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE REACTIONA

PROBABLY BECAUSE OF CHILE'S EXTREME UNPOPULARITY AND THE LACK OF BOTH

A NEUTRAL SPONSOR AND SUFFICIENT PUBLICITY. EUROPEAN COMMUNISTS

SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN THE OFFER TO RELEASE IMPORTANT CHILEAN

LA PRENSA OPOSICIONIITA PUDO ESCRIBIR Y DECIR LO QUE LE PARECIO

LA DUDA SIEMPRE FUE SI DICHOS MEDIOS LOGRARIAN O NO SOBREVIVIR

LA PRENSA ESCRITA OBTUVO UN PRESAGIO DE LO QUE PODPIA SUCEDERLE AL

MONOPOLIZAR. EL GOBIERNO LA IMPRESION DE REVISTAS Y LIBROS EN EL PAIS.

ESTO SE CONSUMO MEDIANTE LA ADQUISICION DE UNA FIRMA EDITORIAL QUE

HABIA SIDO DEBILITADA PREVIAMENTE POR UNA PROLONERDA HUELGA DIRIGIDA

POR LOS COMUNISTAS, Y POR UN ARBITRAJE EN EL QUE ACTUO COMO MEDIADOR

PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS Fir

MEDIA I:: ALLENDE'S CHILE

Psych fili

HIGHLIGHTS

• Since President Allende's electoral victory in 1970, the Government

propaganda apparatus has mounted a coordinated campaign againas

the opposition communicationa media locusing on the prestigious

El Mercurio newspaper chain and key' opposition radios. The long-

range goal is to create conditione that will ingure Government

control over the media so that an emasculated opposition sill operate

intuitively and through sell-cendorship within in approved framework.

• The opposition radio stations bear the brunt of an array of legal

and illegal devices designed to intimidate them.

These devices

include the threat of violence, favoritism in the distribution of

essential Government advertiging revenue, temporary closures,

and Government-fomented etrikes.

- Chile's national television -- the only country-wide channel -- has

become an important propagaren instrument for the Government.

But it is being challenged by a Catholic University channel which is

attempting lo expand its service beyond the Santiago area.

-- A major confrontation between the Government and the opposition,

lasting more than a year, has taken place al the Papelera, Chilc's

only important private newsprint producer, with the company

supported by the opposition media stymying repeated Government

efforts to take over the firm.

The paper company claims that

Government price policies have brought it close to bankruptcy.

• Despite officially-sanctioned harassment, the opposition media

have continued to function, taking advantage of the fluid political

situation currently prevailing in Chile.

and have become increasingly

effective in exploiting the Government's economic failures and the

growing dissension within the ruling Marxist coalition,

• Nevertheless, the opposition's economic base that sustains its media

is being slowly undermined as the Government expands its control

over the Chilean economy.

Llany opposition media are reportedly

already in difficult financial straits.

The Chilean Communist Party,

seeking to strengthen its voice in the March 1973 Congressional

elections, has already purchased five boleaguered radio stations

(one a former opposition station) in southern Chile.

III. THE ALLENDE PROCESS - HOW THE MEDIA ARE TREATED

"A baoic organizational technique for the UP coalition has been the

' establishment of UP cominittees (CUP -- Comiti de Unidad Popular) --

composed of newsmen who are militant meinber of parties belonging

to the Governnient coalition or independent supporters of UP policies --

in newspapers, radios, magazincs, and in journalistic bodica.

The

CUp's have been most active at the union level: demanding exorbilint

wage incrcaoes, insisting that UP employees be given the right to

express their opinion on editorial pages, disrupting legitimate union

meetings, forming rump unions, and leaking internal company dali to

the leftiat press and to the Government.

The goal of certain Unidad Popular militants regarding freedom of

the preas was most explicitly and revealingly stated by the organizing

committee for a conference of leftist journaling which was held in

Santiago in April 1971.

prior to the conference:

... we believe that we must fight for true freedom of

the press, which will only be posoible when there is

true economic independence. We maintain that Chile

will have true freedom of the prede only when the means

of mass communication are part of the area of social

property, that is, (when they) belong to all Chileans,

The press, radio, television, and the theater must be

tools at the service of liberation and culture of our

people and not a private business, an ideological

battering ran of the national and forcign minority

(the capitalists) as is presently the case. ? (under-

lining added)

Another statement said "the mission of journalists"is to support ind

defend the People's Government (the UP) together with all the workers."

The declaration also underlined the support oi UP newsmen for

"Viet-Nam, Cuba, and all the people that are building Socialism,"

and threw a bouquet at Cuba's Piensa Latina agency for its "objective"'

reporting of the Chilean phenomenon.

= lande himaeli lent legitimacy

to the mission of UP journalists in a speech kicking off the conterence

when he stated that "committed" newsmen must act as the "ranguard"

of the revolution by "elevating the political level of the people."

Reiterating a theme expressed on many other occasions, Allende

asserted that his Government would respect freedom of information

while at the same time he lamented his Government's "excessive

tolerance" for the opposition media.

A favorite target of the Government and its propaganda apparatus

Tarred regularly ag "pro-U.S." ind

as a "gringo newspaper written in Spanish" -- potent accusations in

Chile -- El Mercurio has borne the brunt ofjevery conceivable kind of

pressure short of outright seizure.

On numerous occasions the paper has been implicated along with

other opposition media in alleged seditious plots carried out in concert

with foreign (i.c.. U.S. ) interests to overthrow the Government.

Advertisers have been "requested" not ta do businces with the Neecurio

which has been accused of foreign exchange irregularities by

tax authorities, by Government supporters on the paper's own stafi, and

by Allende himself at public

rallies. Allende, too, periodically reacts

to critical Mercurio editorials with charges that Chile and the

Presidential office have been "insulted, " that the Mercurio chain

indulges in "libertiniem unprecedented in Chilean journalistic history."

Government propaganda apparatus follows suit.

Radio continues to be the most important medium of communication

in Chile.

Handbook give Chile a total of 137 stations, including 20 in the capital

The number of receivers is estimated at

In a country 2,600 miles long

radio's strategic importance is understood by both Government and

opposition.

The Government has resorted lo a varioty of devices

designed to intimidare opposition radio stations: requests by Allende

advisers that opposition stations hire designated leflise commentators:

threats of violence: faroritism in the diatribution of needed government

advertising revenues; temporary closures; and strikes fomented by

Partial blame for leftist infiltration of Chilean stationa must rest

with "bourgeois" radio owners. Long before Allende became president

the Chilean businessmen and politicians who owned radio sintiond

made it a practice to hire leftiat commentators because they believed

that leftists were superior professionals and helped to increase

listenership.

When the UP came to power it tapped an existing source

of manpower.

In addition, the Government frequently utilized existing regulations

to gain its ends. Radio concessiona are granted by a Government

entity (Servicios Electricos) attached to the Interior Ministry.

The

same entity can cancel or transfer such concessions.

Regulations

promulgated during World War II state that "In case of internal

disturbance, catastrophe or war radio stations are subject to the

rules, control, and censorship that the Government may

Under this type of emergency regulation, all radio stations were

placed under an obligatory Government neiwork .. not an unusual

spare parts irom abroad. Chile Films

signed a comprehengive exchange accord in March 1971 with the Cuban

Cinematographic Institute (ICAIC) (See Scetion V. C. Exchange of

Chile Filmo also initiated agreements with the experimental film

institute (leitiat) at the University of Chile, the film institute at the

dominated CUT (Central Unica de Trainbadores -- the major labor

The stated purpose of the accords was to

"develop the new Chilean film industry."

Its products are intended lo glorify the roles of workers, peasants,

proletarian role of the Chilear Communist ard Socialist Parties, and

attack the "bourgeoisie" ard their "imperialist" allies. Despite an

The Compañía Manufacturera de Panelos Y Cartones (known as

another propagarda balleground cast by the opposition in terms of

"freedom versus M'arxist totalitarianism.".

In October 1971, the Government, carrying out a long-standing

pledge, announced that CORFO (the Government Decelopment

Corporation) had opened négotiations to buy out the Papelera through

the purchase of its stock.

a campaign to warn the public that the free press would be crippled

if newsprint distribution were placed at the mercy of Government

suppliers. At the same tire, the opposition media pleaded with

private sharcholders to refuse to sell to the Goveranent. In addition,

a "frecdom fund" was created chabling private persons to buy up

Papelera shares to prevent the company from fallina into Government

hands.

For several months pro- and anti-Governmer: media carried out

daily an intensive propaganda battle in advertisements, nows stories,

and

editorials. Both sides resorted to the familiar numbers game:

the pro-Allende media claimed that the Governmen: was besieged by

willing shareholders eager to sell out; the opposition asserted that

shareholders were resisting temptation. Goverr=er propagandists

argued that newsprint production was essential to tie State and must

be controlled by lne Siate; the opposition said Pacelera must remain

in private hands as á patriotic duty.

Thwarted to date in

its attemp: to buy out Papelesa sharcholders,

the Government has not hesitated to use other measrees • price

controls, labor-induced production shortages, and strong-arm tactics

to prevent the delivery of raw material to the plane.

Papelera to weaken the will of private starcholders ind their supporters.

That the Papolera still withstand: these conbined pressures a year

later is a tribute to a determined doiense of the firm by an opposition

Congress, to the loyalty of the bulk of the Popolera employces, and to

an aroused and alerica opposition media.

The battle for control of the Papelera will continue and the odds

are not good for the company, kepeatco requests for price increases

sufficient to absorb cost increases -- forced on the firm in part by

Government economic policies -- were not met, and the firm declared

in September 1972 that it could not meci loan payments due to the

Inter-merican Developrent Dank (IDD).

Finally, in December 1972

the Government authorized now price increases averaging 15 per cent,

which were, however, inapplicable to the price of newsprint.

Papclera gains some breathing space but Government pressures on the

company are certain to continue. The price increase itself may be

viewed as a form of pressure.

The battle has spilled over into the lalls of the Chilean Congress.

that appeals were made to the pocketbooks of the

lower-class Chileans, there was also to be an effort

to increase their class consciousness (concienti.

zacion) through government publications and the

use: of the media to remove the elements of "false

consciousness" instilled by "bourgeois" propazanda

Expressing the diametric opposite of a claim often

voiced by his predecessor, Eduardo Frei, Allende

said in a press conference just after his installation,

"I am not president of all Chileans"" And in his first

"State of the Nation" message to the Congress he

asserted:

.:.. the People's Government (Gobierno Popular) is

Inspired in its policy by a premise that le artificially

denied by some-the cristence of classes and social

sectors with antagonistic and opposing interests.

Allende's economic advisers anticipated an addi:

tional source of revenue for the government from

the "exploitative" profits of the industrier that were

to be nationalized by the new government. The par.

tially American-owned copper mines were to be

taken over by a constitutional amendment both lo

lay to rest any legal doubls about the reversal of

the Frei Chileanization agreements of 1967 and

1969, and because a general consensus in Chile

favored nationalization. Other companies were lo

be isationalized after a controlling. interest nas gained

through the purchase of shares on the open market

by the government development agency. The latter

course seemed facilitated by the fact that the price

of shares had been depressed since the elections,

and further economic pressures could be crested

by allowing wage increases but forbidding any rise

in prices.

The legal adviser to the government,

Eduardo Novoa, also outlined other "legal loopholes"

in existing Chilean law which could be used for

"gemporary" takeovers of companies, including

"intervention" because of labor disputes and "requi-

sition" because of a

"breakdown in supply of an

article of prime necessity.".

within a year it had entered the ranks. of the opposi-

tion.

In July 1971, the Christian Democrats had voted

In favor of the constitutional amendment national-

izing the copper mines, but from that point forward,

the pattern was one of polarization of Chilean politics

and society into two opposing blocks. The Allende

forces controlled the executive and pursued an in-

creasingly vigorous ideological purge of those who

were not entirely sympathetic to the government.

The opposition controlled the legislature, and in

October 1971. the Christian Democrats and the

rightist parties attempted to assert legislative con-

trol over the expansion of the public sector by voting

in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the

use of the intervention and requisition procedures

and requiring that all transfers of private enterprises

to the "social" or mixed sectors be carried out in

accordance with specific legislation adopted by the

Congress. This legislative act, referred to as an

amendment on the "Three. Areas of Property," be-

came the focus of a continuing deadlock between

the President and Congress shat lasted until

Allende's overthrow in September 1973.

Allende's refusal to accept the amendment or to

call a plebiscite lo resolve his differences with the

Congress appeared to the congressional opposition

to be a decisive indication of his determination to

bypass the legislature in carrying out the Popular

Unity program, and from the lime of the adoption of

the amendment onward, the Christian Democrats

began lo cooperate with the rightist parties in op-

posing the executive. One method was to impeach

ministers for violation or (more often) nonenforce-

ment of the law. The first of many such impeach.

ments took place in January 1972. Another method

was to present a united electoral front against the

government. Informal cooperation between

the

rightist parties and the Christian Democrats led to

striking victories in two by elections in January 1972,

and a month later these groups formed the Demo-

cratic Confederation (Contederación Democrática

CODE) to prepare joint lists for the 1973 congres-

sional elections. A third area of cooperation was in

Two days before the September coup, Altamirano

When General Ruiz resigned his Cabinet poll on

August 17 in protest againct his lack of sufficient

power to settle the strine, Allende compelled him

1o add that his departure from the cabinet "im.

This was correctly seen as an Allende

tactic to remove an officer opposed to him, and il

provoking a series of actions which ultimalely led

directly to the September 11 coup.

tank-regiment revolt in June.

The resignation of what appeared to be the last

defenders of Allende in the army now meant that

all three services were opposed to the President. it

coincided with the adoption on the same day of a

"sense of the house" (acuerdo) resolution by the

Chamber of Deputies directed at the President and

the military ministers, drawing their attention to

"The serious breakulown of the constitutional and

legal orcer." * The resolution criticized the Allende

government for repestedly bypassing the legislature

through the use of legal loopholes and for refusing

to promulgate the constitutional reforms voed by

the Congress. It accused Allende of ignoring judicial

orders, encouraging iliegal seizure of property, perse.

cuting opposition labor groups,

and supporting

illegal paramilitary organizations. In conclusion, it

stated that the listed actions constituted a "serious

breakdown of the constitutional and legal order of

In its original form, the resolution had declared

the Allende government lo be illegitiate, but the

acuerdo had later been softentd in order to secure

the support of the Christion Democrats. Yut its effect

was still to give a congressional green light to the

military, and Allende Immediately so interpreted it

He replied to the motion by accusing: tie Congress

of "promoting a coup d'ülit by askin: inc military

the Constitution the only way that the Congress.

could decide on the legality of the President's con-

duct of his office was through. imprachment by a

Iwo-thirds vote.?s

The congressional vote was echoed by several

professional associations. The Medical Association

called on their "colleague" Allende to resign-a

request that was echord by the Fedaration of Pro-

fessionals (CUPROCH) and resignation petitions

were circulated in Santiago. The Lawyers' Association

Issued a declaration which-"without attributing a

malevolent intention" to the President-asserted an

"incompatibility between the institutional framework

within which he ls supposed to exercise his office.

and the actions which he feels oblined to carry out

to be Incapacitated (impedido) in the exercise of his

functions as he understands them," the statement

suerested that he could be removed from office

under Article 43 of the Constitution, which autlior.

ides the Congress to declare presidential incapacity."

The Coup

Exactly when the decision to carry out the coup

mas made is not yet certain, but it evidently was

resched in the days following Prats' resignation.

The armed forces had contingency plans for the

control of vital points throughout the country in case

The immediate causes of the mititary intervention

are apparent from the preceding account. In the last

part of 1972, the military were drawn into Chilean

politics by both sides and became as polarized as

the rest of Chilean socicly with the overwhelming

majority joining the opposition to Allende. The con-

flict over education in March-April 1973 height-

ened that polarization just at the time the military

were *aliempting to extricate themselves from politi-

cal Involvement.

Then the expansion of arms

searches in mid-1973 revealed the extent to which

Chile was becoming an armed camp on the verge

of civil war. Finally, the efforts to subvert the existing

military hierarchy by a combination of lettist activ-

ity among enlisted men and presidential maneuver-

classis scenario for a coup d'etat.

On the last of there three I have already said

real-unfortunately, far more so than Allende

ever secred to realise.

To take just two examples: copper and milk.

Expropriation of the copper mines fron their

Amerian ouners would, no doubt, have led in

itself to the wichdrawal of American rechnicians

consequent risk of losing production umporarly, •

the promotion of tained Chilean managers and

scrious leader who knew where ke was going.

IN aITRosPICy, I am inclined to think this was

always tho truck of the matter with Allende.

Basically, he was a political romantic, dealing in

sensations rather lan sense. He erjoyed his hour

upon the stage but he never properly assessed

_The forces he was dealing with, either for or :

açainst him. He raised expectations on his own

side without commanding the means to satisfy

them, and be encouraged opposiion on the

Al best he was muddle-headed; and sime may

show that he was deliberately deceitiul. Certaialy

be managed to deceive a los of people, including

himself. But in the end reality taught its own, hard

lessons. That you can't be a denocat and a

revolutionary at leash, not in a sovicy that is

alseady adminedly democratic That you can't

be anti-American and exect the Americans to

help you. That you can't pose as the people's

you can't conscrips soldiers into politics and

expect them to remain apolitical. That you can'!

have inflation roários out of sight crud maistain a

world is not Cloudsuckooland. Dunz here,

It is sad shat such elemenlary lessons should

NETHERLANDS

CHILEAN REFUGEES IN NETHERLATDS POINTED OUT AS FUGITIVES

Editorial by N. van Mieuwenhuysen: Reformatorisch Dagblad

Jutch, 19 April 1974, p 5

The Chilean refugees in the Netherlands seem to be

having adjustment problems.

These rather prolonged

symptoms

seem to be caused among other things by the fact that they

still find it hard to accept that the socialist dream of

their barxist president. is

definitely over and that their

country is now being ruled by a small

group of reactionaries

who are

trying to keep the people

under

control through

terrorism, repression, and torture.

Such problems will take

you quite

a ways in the letherlands and those idealists were

quick to take advantage of it.

Welfare

What is the situation?

Most of the approximately

250 refugees with a high school or university education do

not work.

About half of them have been housed at

the

*Huis

ter Schie" in Overschie, where they enjoy the sunshine on

the terrace or play volleyball in the yard.

Board and

lodging are free and at the end

of the week they pick up

another 25 guilders pocket money.

In addition they receive

free language instruction, commuter tickets for the bus, and

compensation for each trip they have to take.

Do you get the

idea that they are better off than

many. old people

in the Netherlands?

You are probably right.

because the Chilean exiles do not have to live on welfare:

they

are being

paid from the frozen funds which had been

allocated for development aid

to their fatherland, Chile.

So you can see how well our tax money is being spent.

They came to Chile as a result of Illegal and

revolutionary activities in which they had been involved in

these south and Middle American countries, the ultimate

consequences of which they did not wish to suffer.

They felt at home in Allende's Chile because Allende

showed sympathy for their situation.

His first action ag

president, after his inauguration in November 1970, was to

declare amnesty for all those who "were members of

terrorist

underground organizations," those who during the last months

of. his predecessor's regime had been charged with bank

the armed robbery

of self-service stores,

of weapons from military arsenals, kidnapping, and

attempted

The fact that some of those revolutionaries recelved

Chilean diplomatic status was due to Allende"s policy of

granting residence permits to this type of revolutionaries.

These refugees with a high school or higher level education

seemed

to have no adjustment problems in Chile.

As a result

they soon found their way to important key positione in the

covernment.

The fugitives didn't

suffer any

THIS PROGRAM CALLS FOR TIGHTER FEDERAL SPENDING AND FOR LIMITING

INFLATION TO 100% IN 1974. THIS IMF PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE BUT MAY

BE SOMEWHAT OVER-OPTIMISTIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WORLD-WIDE ENERGY

CRISIS WILL SOON FORCE CHILE TO RAISE FUEL PRICES, THUS EXACCER-

BATING THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING INFLATIO!. ADHERENCE TO THE IMF

PROPOSAL HAS, HOWEVER, IMPROVED CHILE'S COREDIT RATING, AS HAS THE

SIGNING OF A BILATERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE WHITED STATES ON CHILE'S

THE OPENING OF THE PARIS CLUB TALKS IN FEBRUARY. THE MASSIVE $4

THIS

PHENONENON IS MOST APPARENT IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC POLICY AND IN

SUCH TECHNICAL FIELDS AS PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOUSING. THE IMPORTANCE

OF THE GROUP OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS HEADED BY RAUL SAEZ, FOR EXAMPLE

IS WELL KNOWN• THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH HAS AN ADVISORY BOARD

DOMINATED BY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WHILE THE MINISTRY OF

HOUSING'S BOARD IS LARGELY CONTROLLED BY THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENT-

ING PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION FIRMS. SIMILARLY, ALMOST EVERY MINISTRY

AND MANY AUTONOMOUS AGENCIES HAVE PERMANENT CIVILIAN ADVISORY

BOARDS COMPOSED OF REPRESENTATIVES OF GROUPS WHOSE WELFARE IS

AFFECTED BY

THE AGENCY'S ACTIVITIES.

22• IN ADDITION TO THESE CIVILIAN ADVISORY BOARDS, THERE ARE A

LARGE NUMBER OF "STUDY COMMISSIONS" THROUGH WHICH CIVILIANS CAN

EXERT THEIR INFLUENCE. BEST KNOUN OF THESE IS THE GROUP IN INTER-

NATIONAL LAWYERS WHICH IS DRAFTING A NEW CONSTITUTION. BUT THERE

ARE OTHER GROUPS WORKING ON A NEW MINING CODE, STUDYING THE EDUCA -

TICIL SEYSTEM, COLLECTING INFORMATION ON UNCTUMPLOYMENT, URITING A

12. ALTHOUGH SOME CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS. HOLD INFLUENTIAL GOVERN-

MENT POSITIONS, MOST CIVILIAN ADVISERS ARE EITHER CONSERVATIVE OR

APOLITICAL. LACK OF MORE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION BY CHRISTIAN

JEMOCRATS MAY CREATE PROGLEMS FOR THE GOVERHNENT IN THE FUTURE.

ESFECIALLY SINCE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESEHTIUG LORKERS, CAMPESINOS

AND POBLADORES WHICH FORMERLY SUPPORTED EITHER THE CHRISTIAN

DEMOCRATIC PARTY EPDCS OR THE ALLENDE GOVERIIMENTS ARE SO FAR

INADEQUATELY REPRESENTED ON ADVISORY COUNCILS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS

ESTABLISHED UNITS ADDRESSED TO YOUTH, WOMEN, GUILDS AND NEIGHBOR-

HOOD CIVIC GROUPS IN THE SECRETARIAT GENERAL OF GOVERNMENT, AND

HOPES THAT THESE WILL SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR GOVERNMENT-TO-PEOPLE

COMMUNICATION.

I3. THE JUNTA LEADERS VIEW

CHANGED AND PRICES ROSE, THE GROUTH IN THE MONEY SUPPLY HAS DEEN

IN BOTH 1973 AND 1974. EVEN IF DEBT-REPAYMENTS ARE RESCHEDULED IN BOTH

YEARS. WITH A MASSIVE MY BILLION FOREIGN DEOT HANGING OVER SANTIAGO'S

HEAD, IT WILL AT LEAST DE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE CHILE'S BALANCE-OF

G. HOWEVER, COPPER PRODUCTION HAS ALREADY INCREASED MORE

REACH A RECORD 750,000 TONS NEXT YEAR DESPITE CONTINUING SHORTAGES OF

SPARE PARTS AND SERVICEABLE VEHICLES.

HO AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST DRAIN

OF RAW MATERIALS AND SPARE PARTS MUST BE SOLVED TO BOOST PRODUCTION

QUICKLY: LONG RUN GROWTH WILL DEPEND HEAVILY ON CHILE'S ABILITY TO

ATTRACT ADEQUATE FOREIGN INVESTMENT: ATTRACTION OF SUBSTANTIAL NEW.

INVESTMENT WILL DEPEND ON THE JUNTA'S ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE GOOD

FAITH IN THE TREATMENT OF FOREIGN EQUITY AS,THEIR ABILITY TO INSTILL I

CONFIDENCE IN CHILE'S PROSPECTS FOR STABLE RECOVERY AND GROWTH. A

CRITICAL FIRST STEP IS TIMELY SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING COMPENSEATION

CLAIMS EMANATING FROM THE ALLENDE NATIONALIZATIONS. THE JUNTA HAS

STATED THAT IT WILL EITHER RETURN INTERVENED FIRMS TO THE PRIVATE

SECTOR OR. AS IN THE CASE OF THE LARGE COPPER MINES, ADEQUATELY

COMPENSATE THE PREVIOUS OWNERS. SOME 90 FIRMS ARE ALREADY IN THE

PROCESS OF REVERSION.

J. THUS FAR THE JUNTA HAS SUCCEEDED IN LINING UP SUF-

FICIENT FOREIGN CREDITS TO ENABLE IT TO PURCHASE ESSENTIAL CAPITAL

GOODS AND FINANCE THE CURRENT PAYMENTS GAP. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE

STRONG INDICATIONS OF RENEUED INVESTOR CONT ICENCE, AND PRIVATE FOR-

EIGN INVESTMENT IN CHILE IS EXPECTED TO GROW DRAMATICALLY DURING THE

NEXT I2 MONTHS.

•K: THE ECOHOMIC OUTLOOK FOR CHIELE IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTI-

MISTIC AS THE JUNTA TAKES STEPS TO CORRECT THE EXCESSES OF NEARLY

•THREE YEARS OF DECAPITALIZATION UNDER STATE SOCIALISM. THE PROGRAMS

THOUGH AUSTERE: ARE ECONOMICALLY SOUND AND OFFER A FIRM FOUNDATION

FOR RECOVERY AND GROWTH OF THE CHILEAN ECOMOMY. THE MAJOR POLICY

CONFLICTS WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT APPEAR TO BE OVER THE DEGREE AND

TIMING OF SPECIFIC MEASURES RATHER THAN PROBLEMS OF BASIC POLICY

ORIENTATION.

Lo THE EMERGING DOMINANCE OF RAUL SAEL AS SENIOR ECONOMIC

ADVISOR IS PROBABLY

FOR THE BEST SINCE THE JUNTA'S AUSTERITY PROGRAM

MUST BE TEMPERED IF POLITICAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC FECOVERY AND .

STABILITY IS TO BE ACHIEVED. MEANUHILE, CHILE IS PREPARING TO

SETTLE OUTSTANDING COMPENSATION ISSUES AND COMPLETE BILATERAL NE-

GOTIATIONS ON 1971/72 DEET SERVICE IN ACCORD WITH THE 1972 PARIS

CLUB AGREEMENTS. TIMELY RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES MILL GO FAR

IN IMPROVING INVESTOR AND CREDITOR CONFIBDENCE IN CHILE.
