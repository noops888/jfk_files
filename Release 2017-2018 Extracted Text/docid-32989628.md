The purpose of this memorandum is to summarize investigativ

efforts to authenticate Hoover memoranda dated 8/24-25/36.

Document Section, FBI Laboratory, determined the type appearing

on Hoover memorandum dated 8/25/36 was prepared on a Remington typewriter

with àn elite type used since October, 1935. Hoover memorandum to Tamm dated

9/10/36, was prepared on an IBM typewriter with pica-style type used since 1930:

The letterhead used on both Hoover memoranda of 8/24-25/36 was

authorized FBI stationery effective August 14, 1936.

On 3/10/75, Mr. Donald B. Schewe, Assistant Likrarian, Reference

Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Hyde Park, New York, advised that

The White House Ushers Appointment Book contained entries showing that

on Thursday, August 24, 1936, from 9:20 a.m. to 10:12 a.m., President

Roosevelt met with Mr. Hoover in his residence at The White House prior to

leaving for his office. Schewe pointed out that this meeting was significant

since President Roosevelt met Mr. Hoover immediately after returning from

an extended trip, a departure from his usual practice. There was no entry

on 8/25/36, other than the President's departure for the Dakotas at 10:40 p.m.

On 4/2/75, review of Cordell Hull Papers, Library of Congress,

reflected that a Desk Diary (container #68, folder #295, microfilm #38) of

Secretary'Hull contained an entry on 8/25/36 that the Secretary had luncheon

with the President between 1: 00 p.m. to g"t Mine

RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT FRANKLIN D.

ROOSEVELT LIBRARY, HYDE PARK, NY

ON 3/10-12/75

On 3/10/74, Mr: DONALD B. SCHEVE, Assistant

Librarian in the Reference Archives, Franklin D. Roosevelt

Library, Hyde Park, NY, was advised

of our interest in

locating any communications bearing upon a conversation

between former President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT and former

Secretary of State CORDELL HULL in the latter part of

August, 1936.

Mr. SCHEWE was advised that this conversation

was concerned with the security of the US and that Mr. J.

conversation.

allegedly reduced the subject matter of above conversation

to a memorandum and that we were interested in locating

this memorandum or some information bearing upon above

conversation.

Arrangements were made to meet with Mr. SCHEWE

at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, NY,

on 3/12/75. Mr. SCHEWE indicated that in the meantime

se would conduct some research in this matter.

on 3/12/75, Mr. SCHEWE advised that he had

conducted some research relative to our telephone call

on 3/10/75, and inquired 1f we could be more specific

with regard to the dates of the information desired.

"SCHEWE

was advised that to the best of our knowledge the

conversation we were interested in involving FRANKLIN D.

ROOSEVELT (FDR), HULL and Mr. HOOVER, occurred on

approximately 0/24-26/36 and that the conversation concerned

the internal security of the US.

copy of a

dated 8/24/36, (copy of which is

attached) on White House stationery, classified "Confidential

and addressed to the Secretary of State from FDR"

Mr. SCHEWE stated that "buck slips" are nothing more

than a cover memorandum utilized to transmit communications

which are

It is to be noted that this

"buck slip" indicates that attached to it was a memorandum

for the secretary of State, unsigned, undated and

recommending coordination of activities of all agents

of the Government in foreign countries.

that the synopsis of this memorandum which appears on.

the "buck slip" was the usual practice at that time to

Identify the documents attached to it. SCHEWE added.

that this was the only document he was able to locate

which may have some bearing on the desired information.

SCHEWE stated that the possibility exists that the

referred to memorandum may be located

among the collection

of papers of CORDELL HULI which are now stored at the

Isbrary of Congress,

washington, D.C.

Mr. SCHEWE then exhibited to interviewing personnel

the White House Ushers Appointment Book which was

hand-written and kept on a daily basis. This appointment

book contained the following pertinent information:

Thursday, August 13, 1936, at 9:50 AM

FDR departed the white House for a visit

to the flood areas in NY, Ohio and Pennsyl-

vania.

Thursday, August 24, 1936, FDR returned

to white

House at 8:45 AM.

9:20 AM FDR met with Mr. HOOVER from

9:20 AM to 10:12 AM.

(Note * - There is no entry in this book

for Aug. 24, 1936, indicating that Mr.

HULL was there.

Mr. SCHEWE advised that

It is interesting to note that. FDR met

Mr. HOOVER in his residence in the White

House on 8/24/36, prior to leaving for

his office in the White House:

SCHEWE

also pointed out that this meeting was

significant since FDR met with Mr. HOOVER

on 8/24/36, immediately after returning

from an extended trip.

This, according

to SCHEWE was a departure from FDR's

usual practice.

There was no record in the White House

Usher's Appointment Book for 8/25/36, which would indicate

that FDR met with either Mr. HULL Or Mr. HOOVER on that

date.

This book indicates that FDR departed the White

House on Tuesday, 8/25/75, at 12:40 PM for a trip to the

draught areas, in upper Maine, South Dakota and North

Dakota, as well as a visit to Mt. Rushmore.

FDR did not

return to the White House until Sunday, Sept. 6, 1936,

at 10:02 AM.

The White House Usher's Appointment Book

further reflects that FDR, during the period July 10,

1936,

to Aug, 10, 1936, was away from the white House

campaigning.

FDR returned to the White House on

8/10/30, and remained there until 8/13/36, when he

igain departed on a trip and returned on 8/24/36

FDR also departed from the White House on 8/25/36,

and returned on 9/6/36.

Mr. SCHEWE also produced to interviewing

personnel the appointment book of FDR's private secretary,

GRACE TULLY for the pertinent period. This appointment book

reflects all of FDR's office appointments.

A review

of this appointment book fails to reflect that FDR met

or had an appointment with Mr. HOOVER in his office

during the period 8/13/36 to 9/6/36.

However, this

• appointment book does reflect that during this period

FDR did have a meeting with CORDELI HULL On 8/25/36,

at 1:00 PM.

MC. SCHEWE further advised that he personally

reviewed

the following and was unable to locate any

documents or references which could possibly shed some

-light on the matter of interest to us:

1.) Papers kept in FDR's safe.

2.) Papers kept by his secretary in a separate

White House safe.

3.) Papers kept in FDR's official presidential

file.

4.)

Papers kept in FDR's alphabetical file

maintained by his secretary.

5.) Individual agencies files.

6.) J. EDGAR HOOVER's file.

In conclusion; Mr. SCHEWE stated that after

reviewing all of the are data, he concluded that the

pertinent document of interest

to us is not at the FDR

Library at Hyde Park, N1•

SCHEWE added that if any

such document is at the Library,

it is misfiled and

as there are approximately 21 million pages of manuscripts

and documents at the Library, it would be impossible

to locate same.

It is to be noted that on the enclosed

"buck slip" there are four penciled notations, 1.e.

285-C, X20, X285 and X67.

SCHEWE stated that

these

nottions are part of the FDR Library cross-reference

system.

SCHEWE added that he checked these refereness

and could locate nothing further regarding the matter

of interest to us.

SCHEWE stated that these references

pertained to the enclosed "buck slip"

On 2/6/75 Mr. Kelley and I met with Senator Church

and Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee.

Senator Church pointed out that he intended to run the Committee in

a very responsible manner, had no intention of destroying or impairing

the effectiveness of the intelligence community and, in fact, hoped that

the efforts of the Committee would help to reestablish public confidence

in the intelligence agencies.

Parameters have not been drawn but Senator Church feels that

the Committee will confine its activities largely to inquiries into domestic

activities. The inquiries will be designed to determine whether agencies

have acted outside the law and the type of remedial legislation necessary

to prevent such abuses in the future.

Study will be largely concerned with the activities of the Central

Intelligence Agency but will, of course, involve the FBI and other agencies

involved in domestic 'intelligence.

A MAY Y

The Committee hopes to have a nonpartisan staff of approximately

40 employees headed up by Mr. Miller and would appreciate having necessary

background investigations expedited to permit an early clearance. Miller

indicated he has already been in touch with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Bowers in

this regard. It was explained that the contemplated procedure involved the

FBI conducting the full-field investigation necessary with the results being

furnished to the Chairman, after which he would, upon being personally

satisfied as to their loyalty, furnish the results to CIA for final clearance.

Senator Church appeared satisfied with this arrangement. He stated that

he wanted to prevent leaks and be hopefully as successful as the Judiciary

Committee was on the impeachment inquiry. Our experience in this regard

was pointed out whergin the Judiciary Committee in connection with the 17

wiretaps had written us alter indicating that if we made lastiet

Re: SENSTUDY 1975

information available they would afford it appropriate security restricted

to members only, excluding staff, and would not make the information

public. Subsequent to the hearings, the Committee published its report

which contained our classified documents right along with the Top Secret

classifications. Senator Church was not aware of this, appeared surprised

by it, and stated surely the information must have been declassified. I

advised him that not by us and it was our information.

Senator Church was asked whether in his opinion the formation

of the Select Committee would have any effect on the proliferation of

committees seeking to obtain testimony from the FBI and it was his opinion

that this would have a favorable effect. He said he had been in touch with

other members of the Senate who felt that it was a waste of time to have

repetitious testimony on the same subject matter before a variety of

committees and he had the feeling that the other committees would hold off

until after the Senate Select Committee completed its hearings. He indicated

that he could not vouch for what would happen in the House, however, he

intended to speak to the House leadership in order to try to effect some

coordinated approach there also, because he was well aware of the large

number of committees seeking to provide oversight or obtain information

from the intelligence agencies.

A question arose as to the extent of cooperation with the Committee

and Senator Church was assured that the FBI would be completely responsive

subject to certain limitations which would have to be delineated by the

President in order to protect sensitive sources and information. Senator

Church indicated that he was going to talk to the President in this regard in

order to secure his complete cooperation, and it was Senator Church's feeling

that the Committee should be entitled to answers to any questions they might

ask without restriction other than, of course, the identities of informants.

He felt the progress of the Committee would be severely impaired if it were

necessary to go to Court over such questions to obtain enforcement of their

right to have access to whatever information they need.

SUBJECT:

Community Aspects of Inputs to Congressional

Committees Investigating Intelligence

1. The Intelligence Community Staff, with John M. Clarke,

Associate Deputy/IC, as my representative in these matters, will

Keep the Board and other appropriate officials advised as to

progress of the investigations conducted by the Senate and House

• Seleci Committees investigating intelligence activities. In particular,

it will ensure that we are kept informed as to materials which are

formally being provided to the Select Committees by all elements

of the Community. The USIB Ad Hoc Group will assist on this

, matter and provide the mechanism for regular and constant communi-

cations.

2. In response to this assignment, the Intelligence Community

Staff is establishing a registry for documentation relating to the

investigations. This registry will be a source of reference of all

responses, testimony, et cetera, provided by USIB agencies and

available to your designated representatives.

3. In order to make the registry useful to the Board, it is

essential that it include:

a. File copies of documents or other materials which

each Intelligence Community elément provides to one of the

Select Committees where the originating agency considers

the materials to involve aspects of Community activities,

and/or which may result in follow-on queries concorning

the functioning of the Community. The availability of this

documentation will be of particular importance if it is

expected there will be subscquent inquirics relating to the

materials provided and involving elements of the Commanity

other

ALL DEINFORMAT

Washington, D. C.

Dear Frank:

Reference is your request for comments on the sample

abstracts prepared in the FBI as a report on materials being

provided to the Senate Select Committee.

As you know, we want to make the Community Registry as

complete a record as possible of what is provided to the

Committee, and for this reason hope that the actual copy of

special reports and particularly mportant documents witt be

provided to the Registry.

Where this is not done, an abstract

or summary of each document or homogenous set of documents.

We have amended the abstract format slightly to include

an entry for "Document Classification."

A copy of the

amended format is enclosed.

Your sample abstracts require a few alterations to make

them more "indexable."

a.

Item 1, "TITLE/SUBJECT" refers to the subject

matter of the material which is being provided.

The

abstract on the FBI Manual of

Instructions should have

an entry here something like "Instructions covering FBI

Investigations in the Security Field," rather than the

title of the Senate Committee.

b. The date at the head of the page should be

the date of preparation of the abstract. The date of

submission to the committee is listed at Item 9.

c.

The entry

"ORIGINATING ORGANIZATION" identified

the organization with authority to release the document.

## Page 31

d.

The "SUMMARY OF CONTENTS" section should

be brief, but also should clearly indicate what is

being provided to the Committee. I wonder, for

instance, whether your sample on the letterhead

memoranda was issued in widely separated time periods:

The summary as written gives no indication as to

the particular subject of any of the memoranda and the

single sentence now used to describe all of them covers

the waterfront.

If the request for information comes officially

from the committee, the Committee title should be entered

under "REQUESTOR,

but if the requestor is an individual

member of the Staff, his name should be indicated.

f.

The last entry in the format, "PROBLEM AREAS, "

has particular significance since it is important to

Know lI there are third Agency, or sources ana methoas,

or other sensitivity problems involved,

and this is

the place to identify them.

We are beginning to use

the abstracts prepared in our office as an aid to

obtaining release clearance when we are dealing with

the document for which another agency must concur in

the release. The "PROBLEM AREAS" section gives such

other agency an idea as to whether we see any important

reason why they should be concerned about release of

the document.

The entry in this final section of the

format is expected to prove useful for this purpose.

5.

One copy of the document or its abstract is all

is needed by the registry.

DATB:

FROM The Attorney General

SUBJECTNICROPHONE SURVEILIANCE

iy 24,1950.

155-20

the recent decision of the Supreme Court entitled Irvine v.

Califoreia, 347 U.S. 128, denouncing the use of microphone surveillances

by city police in a gambling caso makes appropriate a reappraisal of

the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau oi

Investigation of microphone surveillance in connection with matters

relaiing to the internal security of the country.

It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone

cuirclianão ds the only possible may nê uncoverine the activities

an espionage agents, messinle sahnteurs, and subversive persons. In

such instances I am of the opinion that the national interest requires

that nicrophone curreillance be utilized by the federal Bureau of

Investágation.

This use need not be limited to the developnent oi

evidence for prosecution. The FBI has an intelligence function in

connection with intomal security matters equally as important as

the duty of developing evidence for presentation to the courts and

the national security requires that the FBI be able to use microphone

surveillance for the proper discharge of both of such functions.

The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance

by the fBI under these circumstances and for these purposes.

I do not consider thät the decision of the Supreme Court

in Irvine v. Califomia, supra, requires a different course. That

case is readily distinguishable on its facts. The language of the

Court, however, indicates cortain uses of microphones which it would

be well to avoid, if possible, even in internal security investiga

tions.

It is quite clear that in the Irvine case the justices of the

Supreme Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of

installing a microphone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization

of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking. The

Court's action is a clear incication of the need for discretion and

intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all

cases, including internal security matters. Obviously, the insialla-.

tion of a microphone in a bedroom or ir sone comparably intimate

Location should be avoided wherever possible. It may appear, however,

that important intelligence or evidence relating to motheri connected

with the national security can only be obtained by the installation oi

a micropione in such a location.

It is my opinion, that under such

circustances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by the

•Suprere Court's decision in the Irvine case:

ww. 55118 DorTd:32989628

Page 43

## Page 44

-2=

Previous interpretations which have been fumished to you

as to what may constitute trespass in the installation of microphones,

suggest that the views expressed have been tontative in nature and

have attempted to precict the course which courts would lollow

rather than refleci the present state of the law. It is realized

that not infrequently the question oi trespass arises in connection

with the installation of a microphone. The question of whether a

trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect

of such a trespass upon the acmissibility in court of the evidence thus

obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circumstances

of each case.

The Department in resolving the problens which may arise

in connection with the use of microphone suveillance will review the

circunstances in each case in the light of the practical necessities

of investigation and of the national interest which must be protected.

It is my opinion that the lepartnent should adopt that interpretation

which will permit microphone covarage by the FBI in a manner most

conducive to our national interest

I recognize that for the FBI.

to fulêill its important intelligence function, considerations of

internal security and the national saiety are paramount and, there-

fore, may compel the inrestricien

collection and/or counterintelligence matters, operations or activities,

together with the percent of total agent man-hours devoted to such matters,

operations and activities ( page 3, item iliC of relet).

The purpose of this memorandum is to forward to the Legal

Counsel Division, through the Intelligence Division, the response, attached

It is noted the request specifically mentions internal security,

intelligence collection and counterintelligence matters. Our response has

been constructed in the traditional two categories of internal security and

counterintelligence. Intelligence collection (informants) is included in the

data for both of the other categories as appropriate.

ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, WOC:aso, 4/4/75

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures

prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current

Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these

figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a

hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability

the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreigr

threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends

that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate

Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment

Regarding the observations of the Intelligence Division

concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to

counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the FBI, the

Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:

of

classist

(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this

Division has had with Fred B. Griffith of the Inspection Division, it

In earn appears that the information contained in this memorandum may be

classified confidential under Executive order 11652.

(2) Before making any determination as to whether we

make such information available to the Senate Select Committee, it

would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to

such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be

consistent in this area. In this regard SA Paul V. Daly has contacted

Leon F. Schwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requested

he determine from CIA what their position in this regard is.

(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and fast

position that this information not be made available to the Committee or

that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for

this information. We should rather develop some fallback position such

as that this information will be made available to the Chairman of the

Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

Mr. L. C. Groover to Mr.

3/475 entitled "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Director Sec'y -

Activities" forwarded to the Intelligence Division for review

the titles and numbers of FBI field office Agents assigned to

internal security, intelligence collection, and/or counter-

intelligence matters, operations or activities. This was in response

to requirement IIIC of Senator Church's' letter dated 3/19/75.

By addendum dated 4/4/75 the Intelligence Division

recommended that the Legal Counsel Division discuss with the

staff of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) our reluctance to

provide these type figures to the SSC.

On 4/11/75 I discussed with Mr. John Clark, Associate

Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence for the intelligence

community, the request of Senator Church.

Specifically, Mr. Clark

was asked

i Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had received such a

request and how they responded. Mr. Clark advised that CIA had

not received a specific request for the titles and numbers of

CIA officers assigned to intelligence collection or counter-

intelligence matters. However, CIA had received a request to

identify the names and numbers of CIA covert officers assigned

overseas.

REC- 106

62-111395--

Mr. Clark advised that CIA-intended to advise the Staff

on 4/11/75, from 10:00 am until 12:20 pm, staff

members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Activities were briefed by Assistant Director Wannall and

members of his staff in the Conference Room at INTD.

Briefed

from the Committee were Mr. William Miller, Staff Director;

Mr. Frederick A. O. Schwarz III, Chief Counsel; and

Messrs. Mark Gitenstein, Marvin Epstein, Patrick Shea, Britt

Snider

and Loch Johnson, all staff members.

The first hour of the briefing was occupied with

the showing of the INTD slide presentation and

commentary

which provided highlights of the work of the INTD,

both in

the counterintelligence and internal security field. Following

this presentation a question and answer period ensued for the

rest of the briefing. Mr. Miller and Mr. Schwarz posed most

of the questions.

In the counterintelligence field the thrust of the

questioning was directed toward the continuing growth of the

hostile intelligence presence in the United States and its

(short term and long term offeet on the fBI's operations.

Mr. Wannall pointed out that the Director on previous occasions

had indicated his intention to "beef up" the counterintelligence

effort of the FBI by the addition of some 250 Special Agents,

and that INTD had also effected certain programs designed to

assign certain counterintelligence functions to non-Agent

personnel, thereby freeing additional special Agents to function

as case officers.

In response to a question' as to whether the

additional investigative effort necessary to counter the

mounting hostile intelligence threat might not involve investi

gation of more and more American citizens, ir, Wannall conceded

Mr. Wannall stressed the precautions inherent in FBI policy

The Committee staff appeared to accept

these answers and no critical or hostile attitudes on their

Ipart were evident.

The briefing

was terminated at 12:20 pm, due to

commitments on the part of the staff. Mr. Miller and

Schwarz both expressed their appreciation for the briefing

and indicated it had been most instructive. They indicated

a desire to continue these discussions at some later date and

Mr. Wannall assured them that he would be happy to continue

the briefing at any future mutually agreeable time.

Perhaps most significant of all questions posed was

the final question by Mr. Schwarz in which he inquired as to

what advantages and disadvantages to the FBI could be anticipated

as a result of the Committee fulfilling its mandate,

Mr. Wannall

replied that any statutory authority defining and affirming the

FBI's role in the intelligence collection field would certainly

be a positive achievement, He also stated that any result of

the Committee's investigation which would tend to limit the

investigative resources or the investigative effectiveness of

the FBI would surely be an unfortunate negative factor.

None. For information.

criminal intelligence collection and its relationship to our statutory

"The gathering of criminal intelligence information"

There exist individuals and groups whose daily occupations are directed

toward proit without regard to the restraints of the law.

Their esistence and contribution to the sum of criminal behavior. has been

detected and to some degree measured by the collection of data concerning

their personalife-styles, property holdings, associates, influence, and

access to capital. Such information has been characterized as "criminal

intelligence."

For years, the FBI has been aware of the need to identify

these resources of the criminal element. Congress responded to this

need through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The Congressional

findings were that organized crime in the United States is a highly

sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains

billions of dollars from America's economy by unlawful conduct and by

the illegal use of force, fraud and corruption. Legitimaic business and

labor unions are infiltrated and corrupted and our democratic processes

are subverted. The problem ias declared to be of of national concern

both as to our economy and the domestic security.

Memorandum J. A. Mintz to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL

INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION

The Act attempted to attack organized crime by making

criminal the management of syndicated gambling and by prohibiting

rackctecring activity charactcristic of organized crime including the

use of illegal proceeds for investment in legitimate business enterprises.

The long-established suspicions of law enforcement officers

were confirmed by the Congressional findings but statutory enactments

did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein. There remains

the task of establishing the identities of those constituting the national

menace and developing prosecutable evidence of their guilt. "Criminal

intelligence" collection is one moans by which this responsibility may

be fulfilled. It may be the only practical means in view of the scarcity

of witnesses willing to testify and of the high mortality potential of those

who do appear. A classic example of such intimidation is reported in

United States v. Addonizio, 451 F2d 49 (3rd Ur. 1972) where a prusueuire

¿trose in a conception case found an arcaymous ants on the cost nf hic

car which read "This could have been a bomb. Keep your mouth shut."

Accepting the need for intelligence gathering as a practical

necessity, the issue remains as to its propriety in the face of Constitutional

protections. If the Supreme Court announces that individuals have a

Constitutionally protected right of privacy that may be overcome only

through established arrest, search, and subpoena procedures, the issue

will be settled. But, thus far, the Court has only drawn upon the concept

of Constitutional privacy to resolve cases involving special circumstances

such as marital affairs (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 179 (1965) ) and

interception of communications (Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967) ;

More specific Constitutional limitations on the criminal

intelligence function may be found in the First Amenciment protections of

speech and assembly; the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasonabie

searches and seizures; and the Fifth Amendment priviloge against

compulsory self incrimination.

The theme consistently found in decisions having a bearing on thi

relationship between these rights and the collection of criminal intelliga ce

is that, when in direct conflict, the collection efforts must yield. Such is

not to label criminal intelligence as necessarily the product of malpractice.

but to recognize the paramount nature of the Constitutional interests being

safeguarded. Other incidents of government regulatory authority have

been required to yield as well when confronted with legitimate claims of

Constitutional protection, e. s. the administrative search cases, Camara v.

Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523 (1967).

Overt and obtrusive conduct susceptible of being characterized

as harassment may well be enjoined as, for example, was the case of an

obvious 24-hour-2-day physical surveillance of an individual, his home,

relatives, friends, and associates (Giancana v. Johnson, 335 F2d 366

(7th Cir. 1964) cert. den. 379 U.S. 1001. Similar results might be

expected where an identitied officer loiters in the subject's place of

business (Bee see Books. Inc. V. Leary, 291 F. Supp. 622 (SD 1. 7. 1950)

or openly attends organizational meetings where ms presence ininviis

ammaninitina and the francontino of the hucinode of the accamily (Tappi

309, United Furniture Workc's v. Gates. 75 E. Supp. 620 (ND Ind. I9?0)).

However, open photographic surveillance oi public gatherings (Donahoe v.

Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (ED Va. 1971)) and secret monitoring of

criminal activities through the use of undercover agents (Lewis v. United

States,

385 U.S. 206(1966) ) and informants (Hoffa v. United Staïcs, 395

U.S. 295 (1966) ) have met with judicial approval.

Obviously, criminal intelligence information gained by un-

reasonable search and seizure or through compelled self-incrimination is

tainted and subject to judicial condemnation upon complaint of one having

the requisite standing.

Perhaps, the decision coming nearest to discussing the.

legality of criminal intelligence collection was Anderson v. Sills. 106 N. J.

Super. 545, 256 A2d 298 (1989), (reversed on the ground more complic

record was necded to support the decision) 56 N.J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970).

New Jersey had responded to the threat of continuing civil disorders by

collecting intolligence intormation on persons and events alleged to have

some rolationship to such activities.

The trial court hold the collection

effort to be unconstitutional because, it conflicted with the First Amendment.

RE: FBI JURISDICTION: CRIMINAL

However, the court order to destroy the intelligence files excepted instances

"where such information will be used to charge persons with specifically

defined criminal conduct." 256 A2d at 305. Thus, the decision may be

interpreted as drawing a distinction between collection of intelligence

information where political or social factors are involved and First

Amendment freedoms therefore may be directly inhibited and collection

of criminal intelligence information where the objective is the establishment

of criminal conduct and the identities of the offenders. While the Fourth

and Fifth Amendment may be enjoyed by the guilty and innocent alike, it

is improbable that the First Amendment would be stretched so far as to

protect freedom of speech and assembly when such speech and assembly

constitute elements of a criminal offense. On appeal, the Supreme Court

of New Jersey returned the case for further development of the record

and observed".. the executive branch may gather whatever information

it reasonably believes to be necessary to enabic it to perform the police

roles, detectional and preventive.

A court should not interfere in the

A tentative conclusion may be stated, subject to further develop-

ment of the case law.

The gathering of criminal intelligence information

for the purpose of developing evidence of specific offenses characteristic

of organized crime is legally justified as well as practically necessary.

Where there is diversion from the proper objective and such collection

efforts are manipulated to cause harassment or where such activity conflicts

with Constitutional rights, to that extent the criminal intelligence program

must be reformed.

ATE INFORNATION CONTAINI

FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

You requested an analysis of the Bureau's authority to conduct

domestic intelligence investigations. The question of the jurisdictional

basis for these investigations is being examined at length by the Domestic

Intelligence Division and will not be discussed here.

It is fair to say that the domestic intelligence program is one

of the more controversial areas of the Bureau's activities.

For one thing,

an intelligence investigation casts a broader net than inquiries that are

discoted toward the proof of a specific offense. A large amount of raw data

is collected, much of which has no immediate bearing on potential offenses

or offenders.

But seemingly trivial information may later become important

in the detection and prevention of violence or civil disorder. There are

also fears that these investigations may eventually touch upon one's

political beliefs, habits or associations; or that information collected for

proper purposes may eventually be misused at the hands of Government.

Each is a legitimate concern.

The notion of Government prying into the

personal lives of its citizens is repellent to all of us. And yet there is a

strong sense that the Government must acquire necessary intelligence

information if it is to meet its responsibilities in connection with the

national security.

One of the major concerns about our domestic intelligence

activities is that they are not supervised or monitored by any outside

agency. The claim is mace that the Executive Branch has been left wide

diserction to define its own authority, and to choose the directions, mothosis,

• and focus of its investigations. For one thing, the law has never made

clear what facts and circumstances must be present to authorize an

intclligence investigation, nor how far such an investigation may lawiully

proced without being directed toward proof of a spocific offense.

• RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

And unlike the practice in criminal cases, our clectronic surveillances in

security matters are not submitted for prior court approval. For another,

the exclusionary rule which provides the usual method of judicial control

over investigative procedures, is not often available in secuity cases.

Since the goal is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the

courts. As a result, the public, the courts, and the Congress have very

little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters.

and what we do with the information acquired.

In response to this situation, some members of the Congress have

pressured for tighter controls over the Bureau, perhaps in the form of a

the choos subson to even const do at ust has expressed par culins

concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Government to

gather information. In an exchange of correspondence with the Department

of Justice, the Senator has requested specific documentation of the

Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic

intelligence information. He has also suggested that legisiation migni ve

enacted, requiring a showing of probable cause before an investigation can

be initiated by the Government. It is doubtful that any such measure would

pass the Congress, but the proposal does show the mood of the times.

A parallel trend may be developing in the courts. In several

recent cases, plaintiffs have made the claim that Government information

gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprehend criminal suspects,

may have a "chilling cifect" on the exercise of First Amendment rights.

These challenges thus far have not been successful. Anderson v. Sills.

to First Amendment rights. Thus, in Davis v. Ichord, 442 F2d 1207 (D.C.

Cir. 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chilled by a Congressional

Committce's investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there was

insufficient justiciability in their claims to create a viable case or

controversy. This was because appellants had "failed to bring the fear of

investigation by the present Committee home to themselves,' their fears

were wholly speculative; there were no criminal proceedings contronting

chem; nor was any action pending. Moreover, the Court in Davis 10u1c

that the power of a Congressional Committee began and ended with the

investigation; whenever a Committee of the Congress seeks punitive action,

the Judiciary must become involved, and thus every investigation has a

judicial check which operates to guarantee the protection of constitutional

rights.

This latter aspect of the Davis decision was giveu peispecure bj

Amendment rights occasioned by investigations conducted by the military

with investigations conducica by a civilian investigative agency, such as the

Federal Burcau of Investigation, the Court observed:

agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the

deterrent on the exercise of the constitutional right

of free speech that such action by the military is, because

a civil investigative agency has no inherent power always

being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and

the approval of the courts. ***

There, the Court pantedly examined the "source of the chill" as it had in

Davis, and in applying the "chilling effect doctrine", singled out the FBI

as a source which does not gencrate a reasonable basis for inhibitions or

apprchensions. In this connection the Court stated,

Mcmorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI AUTIORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Referring to our holding in Davis that the

"source of the chill" is important in determining whether

there is any inhibiting effect on the exercise of First

Amendinent rights, we think that there is a significant

difference between investigative actions taken by a

military agency in reference to civilians and similar

investigative actions taken by a regular investigative

agency of a civilian branch of the Government.

One of the functions of a civilian investigative

agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is

to compile information on law violators, agitators of

violence, and possible subversives. It has always been

recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is

exercised under the direction of the Attorney General.

Investigation is performed by men a majority de whom it

under the direction of lawyers in the Justice Department,

and the information compiled is only usable and effective

through court action. The FBIis powerless to imprison

or to affect his liberty in any way except through the

action of the courts.

As to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of

informants, it has been held that such surveillance is not per se actionable.

See Donahoc v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (E. D. Va. 1971) (police

surveillance of streei demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment

rights).

The Supreme Court in Hoffa v. U.S., 385 U.S. 293 (19G0), held

that the use of secret informants is "not per se unconstitutional"

, and does

not violate the Fifth Amchdment privilege against sclf-incrimination, nor

the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unicasonable searches and

seizures. The Court upheld, as rcasonable under the Fourth Amendment,

admission at trial of evidence obnined by an undercover informant to whom

a defondant spolic without knowlcdge that he was in the employ of the police.

385 U.S. at 300-303. Sce also Lewis v. U.S., 385 U.S. 206 (19G6) and

Lopcz v. U.S., 373 U.S. 127 (1963). .

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI AUTIIORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Moreover, the Supreme Court in U.S. v. White, 401 U.S. 745

(1971), recently held that the use of secret informants does not violate

any constitutionally justifiable expectation of privacy under the Fourth

Amendment, even when an informant uses electronic equipment to transmit

his conversations with defendants to other agents.

If the use of undercover government informants without a

warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment and invade a defendant's

constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, Hoffa v. U.S., supra.

and such informants may write down their conversations with deiendants

and testify concerning them, or simultaneously record and transmit such

conversations to other's,

who may testify against them, On Lce v. U.S.,

343 U.S. 747 (1952); U.S. V. White, supra, then clearly mere visuai

"surveillance" of plainstis in plain vior by informants at public meetings

would not violate their constitutional rights.

It would seem that those who elect to present their views actively

in the public arena deliberately expose themselves to the public. See

Associated Pross v. Walker, 388 U.S. 130 (1967). Any recording of their

activities by the deiendants does not invade their privacy any more than

does a newspaper, radio, or television story, and, indeed, much less since

any information compiled is usable and effective only through court action.

Tatum v. Laird, 444 E2d 947, 957 (D. C. Cir. 1971).

More difficult questions are presented where the investigation

delves into the private affair's of the individuals or organizations. Bụt

even here, the courts have generally sustained our procedures so long as

they comport with the restrictions of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

Memorandum J. B. Hotis to Mr. Dalbey

Re: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

In summary, it is premature to say that the First Amendment

line of cases, dealing with the "chilling" concept offers any substantial

impediment to our intelligence investigations. There is less reason for

optimism, however, with regard to congressional intervention. We

should be prepared,

therefore, to meet arguments regarding the need

for outside supervision. The sound answer, which should satisfy

governmental needs and individual rights, is found in tight internal

controls and carefully developed guidelines.

in the security tield, the basic responsibility of

the rBE is to

investigate revolutionary organizations dedicated

to the violoni overthrow or destruction of the United States

Government. These include old line Marsist groups, for example,

the Connunist, Party, USA, and the Trotskyist Soclalist Workers

Party; and such new revolutionary groups as the Students for

During our mecting on July 29, 1973, you referred to a discussion

• you lad with Senator Charlos WeC. Mathias, Jr., of Maryland during your con-

firmation hetrings ns to the statutory authority of the FBI and the Departnent of

Justice in the field of domestic intelligence investigations. You then asked

Air. Wiltium D. Luckcichous to work with the FBI in weighing the pros and cons

with regard to statutory authority in this area. I mentioned that rescarch wes

touch with Air. luckelshaus with regord to this matter when we have completed

tho roaclis of our concidoration and lindings within the FBI.

Actually, a study has been going on in the fBI for more than two.

years as to the scope of lil jurisdiction and authority, in domestic intelligence

investigations. When Mir. L. Patrick Gray, Ill, Was designated as Acting

Dircotur of the FBI; he inotrucied that a position paper be prepared conccin-

ing the jurisdiction and authority of the FBI to conduct domestic intolligenee

investigations. A position paper was propared wlich in essence sinted that

authorily of the FBI in this field is bosed on legisintive enactmonts, even

though we may have publicly relied kcavily on Fresidential directives as the

basis for such authority. Mr. Gray ordered an in-donth study made of the

position and in August, 1972, a defailed report was furnished to him. I'ho

following is a summary of that report.

Over a period of several nonths there were a number of public

• statemente questioning authority and jurisdiction of the FBI to conduct comestic

intelligence-type invescinutions, particularly where there is no clear-cut

legislative authority apparent. One of the most scarching inquiries was con-

tained in a paper presented by Professor John I. Clue et a tve dey conforence

at Princcton University in October, 1911, sponsored by the Committee for Public

A major thrust of Professor Elliff's paper concorned FBI authority

derived from legislative enactments as opposed to thut derived from Prosidential

directives, beginning with a dircetive issued by President Roosevelt in

September, 1939. Protessor Elliff is of the opinion ihat the 1939 directive,

which was reiterated on three subsequent occasions, was nagnified by the

FBi from its original purpose to & definitive order to conduct inteiligence-type

investigations.

Senator Send. Ervin, as you know, had been probing into the

nature and extont of FBI intelligonco-type investigations. Sunator Ervin had

even announced that he intended to proyose legislation to prohibit the BI

from Investigating any person without that individual's concent, unless the

Government has roason to believe that person hus commitied a crime or' is

about to commit a crime. Other Congreesmen indicated a similar intcrost

in Fist investicative activities.

Our study revealed that the FBI had declared publicly over a

long period of time thri its responsibilities in the domestic intelligence field

are authorized under ingisinüve enactments, Fresidentic directives, und

instructions of the Attorney General. 'the Presidontiai dircetives are obviously

the 1) directive dated September 6, 1039, and reiterated January 8, 1043;

July 21, 1060; and Deceinbor 15, 1953, and 2) Exccutive Order 10450 dated

april 28, 1053 (ond unended but not yet implomented by Executive Order

11005 dated duly 2, 1971).

In carciully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated

September &, 1039, and considering that the subscquent dircetives are all

hinged on that one, we believe that there is a misconception as to the extent

oi jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the Ill by these dircotives. It

appears that while the 1530 directive fixed responsibility on the Fol to handic

espionage, sabotage, and neutality matters, it did not convoy uny authority

or jurisdiction which the fill did not arcady have from lorisiative chactients.

It is ditficult to read into this directive or in any of those which followed any

authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations which would or could

120t be conducted under un umbrella of legislative enactments.

As & matter of historical fact, Prosident Roosevelt in August,

1936, did request formor Director d. Edgar licover to conduct investigations

of subversive activitios in this country, including communton and fasciem.

This request, however, was a confrontial oral roquest and there is doubt

that any record of it was made outride the FM. This request, or Presidential

mandate, was based, incidantally, on the fuet that the law provided that the

IBl could conduct such invostigatons if the Socrutary of State should so

request.

The study sovenled that while tie 1029 ct gog. dirceliver did not

grant any special intelligence gatbering authorty to the Ell, we were respon

sible under these directives to collect all intelligence informaton furnished

by local, sinte, and Esdural law en reement agencies and patriotic citizens

and to sift und coordinalo all such information for indications of subversive

activity covered by Fedural siatutue.

The study concluded that the FDI has the rosponsibility to con-

duct whatever investigutiona te nocussary to dotermine if ctatutes rciating

to espionage, sabotage, insurrection or zeboltion, scation, seditious con-

spirney, ncrocody of ovortbrowing the Government, and other such crimes

aficeting the national security have boon violeled, In this connection we

note that in o. leiter dnted September 14, 106?, the Departnont of Justies

advised that the FBl is continually alert to the grublem of zccurring riots

and is submitting intelbironce reports to the legretment oi Justice concern-

ing such activity. This letter onumerated sororal Federal statutes end

stated these could be appliable in using maximum available resources,

investigative and intcitizonce, to crllect and ropert all facts bearing on

tho question of schemos os conspiracies to plan, promote on eggravato clot

activity.

In other words, the Dopartment was requesting all possible

intelle cotte the c cans co vie bat suit bi nitro of retain

investigations relating i0 plans of groups or individuals to overthrow,

destroy, intorfore with or threaten the survival of eifective oporation of

national, state, and local governments.

Based on this study, we believe that hod there never been a

single one of the l'rcridentiul directives is question the fBI would have

conducted and will, through necossity, continue to conduct the same intelli-

gence-type investitations as were conductud from 1939 to the present dait.

We also bellove, however, thai in order to counter the criticiam and skepti-

cism ot such individuals as I'rofeseor Bllift and Senator Fun 2. Ervin that

an up-to-date Escentive order should be issued clearly establishing & need

for iniolligence-type investigations and delineuting a clow authority for the

FBI to conduct euch investigutions based on guidelines established by the

Attorney Gonersi aud adhering to constitutional principles.

The study concinded with two baoic recommendations.

1) That the Dopartment of Justice be requested to sponsor comprchensive

legislation spelling cut the lal's investigutive nuthority in the collection of

Bepartment of Justico be regussted to seck a comprehensive Executive order

which woal couct uny possible gop beiwoen statutory suthority and Executive

necessity in protection of the notional scourity .

At fiast glance tiese recommendations may appear to contradict

our porition that we already, huve statutory suthority to condect socurity-type

investigations; that this being the case we do not need additional legislative

enactmunts, nos do we need an ixocutivo order. But being realistic we think:

that the basio statutes upon which we reiy fon our authority to conduct

domosiic intelligence investigadons need to be updated to tit 1978 needs.

Title 15 U.S.C. Suctions 2062, 2384, and 2335 relate to the nutional security,

but the legislarive listory où 2303 and 2081 indicates that they were designed

for the Civil War era, not the lwentieth Century, and Soction 2385 has been

reduced to a fragilo shell by the Supreme Court. Chose statutes are unques-

tionably still valid, but undating is certainly indicnted. The bills introduced

as 1i.I. 6046 and ö. 1400 in lid 952'd Congress appear to contain lenguege which

should fill our stuistory necds, except perhaps for those groupe, such as the

Ku klur ilan, which do not sock to overthrow the Government, but never

theless are totditurian in nature and seck to deprive constitutionally cuarantecu

rightis.

The Attorney General

As to the need for un Executive order, we think that two lssues

are involved. We have statutory authority, but what we need is a chirative

requirement from the President as to the nature and type of intelligence data

he requirca in the pursuit of his responsibititics based on our statutory

authority. In other words, thore is a need, from eur standpoint, for both

authoritative and definitive guidelines. The stututes give us the authority.

The Exccutive order would defino our national security objectives.

Member's of Congrose, Including such men as Senator Robert C.

• Byrd of West Virginia, have proposed legiclution to spoll out jurisdedion and

authority of the F'DI in this field. It would appeur that the Prosidont would

rather spell out his own requirements in an Esecutive order instend of having

Congresa tell him what the FBI might do to help hin fullil his obligations and

responsibiuties as President.

The polliical climute of suspicion and distrust resulting fron

disclosures coming out of the Motorgate neurings could present an obutnole

to getting any such Executive order signed in the immeciate future. Lowever,

the rationale is novertheless valid and when scrutinizos closcly, the Jenguage

in the likecutive order we hereinatter propose establishes definitive mádelines

which have heretofore been unclear, It is my belicf that we should go forward

with this.

We therofore propose and recommend that on Exccutive order

along the following lines be submitted to the White Louse with a stoog

recommendation for approval. The language which foliows is mercy to

¡lustrate the type oi ixecutive order which we thunk would be appropriate

and does not necessarily represent an ideal format or style which should

be subruitied to the White House.

terrorist assaults on forcign disonatic personnel and establishments; and open

which have bech perpetruted by domestic subversives who seek to destroy or

once confined to far away places and zelated to problems of no immediate con-

cern of ours are now possible in this country: Foreign torrorist groups in

have laid plans for terrorist attrains on Americul soil. Arcady one foreign

official has been assassinated, possibly by tercorists.

it would be folly to Mopt an investgative policy based on

the concelt of investigation only then there in rcason to believe a crime

involving the nationol sicurity tea beer contitted. The FBi must

obviously anticipate tue eries doscribed above. We believe that in

older' for the Covermant to be in position to lutend itscli against revolu-

tionary and terrorist eflorts to costroy it, the kEl must have sufficient

investigative authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations not

normally associated with enforcemant of the ctututes. In other words we

think the Fresident has the inhoient Baecutive power to expand by further

defining the Ill's invostigative authority to cauble it to develop advance

information concerniny the plans und aspirations of terrorists and revolu-

tionarios who seek to overthrow or destroy the Government. However, we

also beliove that such expanded authority must be formally soi forth in an

Executive order and that this reccimendation is responsive in the littorney

General's expressed interest in lrying more formal guidelines to our work

in areas where definition is not now cloar.

We consider the issuance of a now Executive order delineating

our jurisdiction, authority, and responsibility to gather and report intellence

information relating to the national security to be a very important and high

priority matter. We bolieve the issuance of guidelines by the Attorney General

under Title 28, Section 533, Unitod States Code, to be equally important.

For your information, our own investigative guidelines as con-

tained in our Manual of Instructions relating to domestic subversive investiga-

tions have been completoly rewritten to conform with the concept that our

donostic intelligence-type investigations are based on Fedoral statutes. These

guidicines provido that in each instance, lue domestic intelligence investigation

must be predicated on informotion indicoting that the organization or individual

is angoged in activity which coula involve a violation of specific statutos sclating

to the national scourity. A copy of the new guidelines was previously provided

to the Dopartment vi Justice in connection with the request of Schator Edward il.

Kenoidy to obtain a copy of the il's Section 87 of the Manual of Instructions.

Dis eifective auto of the new guidelines was August 1, 1973.

ADDENDUM: Intelligence Division, WOC:aso, 4/4/75

The Intelligence Division has reviewed the attached figures

prepared by the Administrative Division. Under the criteria of the current

Classification Act it would be impossible to justify classification of these

figures; however, should they be made public or fall into the hands of a

hostile foreign intelligence service, it would reveal the current capability

the FBI employs in the field of counterintelligence against the total foreign

threat. In view of the above, the Intelligence Division strongly recommends

that the Legal Counsel Division discuss this with the staff of the Senate

Select Committee pointing out the vulnerability implicit in this attachment

in an effort to have the Committee withdraw its request identified as III C.

Kegarding the observations of the Intelligence Division

concerning the making available the amount of manpower dedicated to

counterintelligence and domestic intelligence work in the IDI, the

Legal Counsel Division has the following observations:

(1) Based on our analysis and conversations this

Division has had with Fred B, Criflith of the Inspection Division, it-

appears that the information contained in this merorandum may be

classified confidential under. Executive order 11652.

(2) Before moking any determination as to whether wo

make such information available to tho Canate Celect Committee, it

would appear we should determine from CIA what their response to

such a request will be so that our position and that of CIA will be

consistent in this area. In this regard SA Faul V. Daly has contacted

Leon F. Echwartz, Liaison Section of Intelligence Division, and requeated

he dctermine front CiA what their position in this regard is.

(3) It is not believed that we should take a hard and inst

position that this information not be made avallable to the Committee or

that we make an effort to have the Committee withdraw their request for

this information. Tre should rather develop some fallback position sach

as that this information will be made available to the Chairman ot the

Committee or will be made available during an oral briefing, etc.

In connection with our investigations of staff members for

captioned Committee, we have developed derogatory information on two

individuals which has been brought specifically to the attention of William Miller,

Staff Director of the Committee, One of these involved Mrs. Diane Eloise

LaVoy whose sister-in-law questioned her loyalty and declared she "does not

love America." The sister-in-law said Mrs. LaVoy constantly criticized the

U. S. Government and its policy and underlying weaknesses of our society.

Another individual said she was highly critical of CIA activities. This information

was pointed out to Miller on 3-25-75 when the results of the investigation were

delivered to him, and he also was advised that the CIA would be furnished the same

data in accordance with our agreement concerning these matters.

On 3-24-75 and 3-28-75 results of the investigation coneerning

Mrs. Betty Dale Ellison were delivered to Miller and he was advised that a prief

supervisor with eight years of training and experience in psychiatric care states

he felt Mrs. Ellison needs psychological examination. He termed her a troubleg

maker and said he would have fired her if he had the authority. He described

her definitely as a security risk due to her mental and emotional instability.

It

lalso was pointed out to Miller that other former supervisors described her as

unstable when working under pressure and unable to get along with fellow emplo

ees.

Miller was told that this information also would be furnished to CIA.

On 4-2-75 Miller advised Inspector Bowers he had considered the

matter involving Mrs. LaVoy and had discussed it with the Committee Chairman,

and they had decided to proceed with her as a staff member since they did not feel

the derogatory remarks by her sister-in-law were sufficiently strong enough to

disqualify her since the remainder of the investigation was favorable.

investigation showed justifiable concern for her being cleared for the staff, and

he asked for any guidance we might give him. It was pointed out that the only

real solution to the situation seemed to be that she not be added to the staff.

Miller said he would appreciate any comments from the CIA also in this regard.

Director Sec'y

and Special Agent Paul V. Daly met with William Miller, Staff Director;

Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr., Chief Counsel; and Michael T. Epstein of

the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff. During the meeting Mr. Schwarz

requested a briefing be arranged for staff members of SSC concerning the

ve'

operations of the Intelligence Division, that they be furnished copies of training

documents pertaining to matters handled by the Intelligence Division, and that

they be furnished a glossary of terms used in the intelligence field. He pointed

out the aforementioned material would greatly assist in the SSC staff developing

an understanding of the Intelligence Division operations and hopefully prevent

misunderstandings or needless requests of the FBI.

Mr. Miller advised that Senators Frank Church and John Tower

intended to contact the Director in the immediate future to discuss arrangements

relating to the SSC's review of the FBI activities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) Intelligence Division review and where possible make available

training documents relating to training concerning Intelligence Division matters

and a glossary of terms used in the intelligence field, or recommend a sounter offer,

At 11:00 a.m. on April 17, 1975, Inspector John B. Hotis

Special Agent Paul V. Daly and I met with Deputy Attorney General Tyler

and Associate Deputy Attorney General James Hutchinson at the request

of the Deputy Attorney General.

Deputy Attorney General Tyler advised that he had been requested

by Burke Marshall and F.A. O. Schwarz, II, who are consultant and General

Counsel, respectively, for the Senate Select Committee, to meet with

him on Monday afternoon, April 21, 1975, to discuss matters relating

to the Committee's activities. The Deputy Attorney General said that he

has been personally acquainted with Mr. Marshall for a long time and also

is acquainted with Mr. Schwarz. He considered the possibility of having

a Bureau representative attend the meeting, but then decided it would be

best if he would meet with Marshall and Schwarz privately to determine

whether they desire to discuss details of the Committee's responsibilities

and if it became necessary, he would request the Bureau to send a

representative to the meeting.

The Deputy Attorney General said that he would, of course,

advise us orally or in writing of the results of his conference with Mr. Marshall

and Mr. Schwarz.

2 APR 22 1975

The Deputy Attorney General inquired as to the procedure

currently being employed in responding to the Committee's requests

and Inspector Hotis explained the current procedures. I mentioned to the

Deputy Attorney General the existence of the Ad Hoc Committee of

Intelligence Agencies and suggested to him that he might desire to designate

a representative to attend those meetings in order to be on notice as to the

policies being developed by the White House and the intelligence community

in responding to Committee requests. I explained to him that James

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Department's representative on the Committee, but he has now been

reassigned to responsibilities at the White House. I told him that

Assistant Attorney General Scalia had been scheduled to attend the last

meeting of the Committee, although he was unable to attend. The

Deputy Attorney General said that he would discuss with Mr. Scalia

the possibility of having Mr. Scalia attend as the Department's

representative.

I asked the Deputy Attorney General whether he was undertaking

the principal responsibility in the Department for matters relating to the

Senate Select Committee and other committees that may be inquiring

into the FBI and he said that that was not clear as yet because the Attorney

General has taken a personal interest in these matters and it appeared that

the responsibilities are still fragmented within the Department. It was

his opinion that the responsibilities should be centralized and he appeared to be

willing to undertake that responsibility.

It was my impression that the Deputy Attorney General was

interested in being of assistance to the FBI in these matters and expressed

a willingness to cooperate by having the FBI participate as much as

possible with the Deputy Attorney General.

Mr. WIlTiam G. Miller is the Staff Director

for the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations

with respect to intelligence activities.

On 10/5/73,

representatives of our Washington Field

interviewed Mr. Miller, with Bureau approval, relative to

contacts he had had with members of the soviet Embassy,

Washington, D. C.

SAt that time, Mir. Miller vas the

Director of the Special Senate Committee to Terminate the

National

Emergency.

On that occasion he was most coopera-

tive, and upon being advised that the FBI's interest in

(S)[Soviet Embassy personnel focused more on their personalities

rather than Soviet policies per se, Mr. Miller agreed to

be intervieved whenever the FBI felt such was necessary.

Re:

Rapota and possibly other soviets.

WFO has noted that

mr. Miller is also known to have been in contact with

Aleksandr A. Kokorev, a First Secretary of the Soviet

Embassy, Washington,

D. C., and a known officer of the

Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU). 5

While Mr. Miller was most cooperative on the last

occasion he was interviewed by the FBI, it is noted he did

not provide any particularly significant information con-

cerning the Soviets with whom he had contacts)While it is

not known at this time whether he could presently provide

meaningful information, an interview with him at this time,

when he is now the Staff Director of the Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations, could well be untimely and

indiscreet.

ACTION:

(1) In view of impending contacts which will be

had by EBIHQ with hr. Miller, the purpose of this memorandur

is to draw attention to the fact that Mr. Miller has hac

past contact with representatives of Soviet intelligence

services and may be continuing to have same. (5)

peter

(2) If you agree,

there is attached a communication

to VTO captioned,

"Grigoriy A. Rapota; IS - R (SOVEMB-

KGB)" which denys authority for an interview with Mr.

Miller

at this tine and instructs that office to promptly advise

FBIHQ of any additional contacts between Mr. Miller and

representatives of the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C.,

which may come to its attention. (5)

a task force entitled Project Senstudy 75.

The concept behind the establishment of this Project

is to develop a capability of implementing requests received

from Select Committees of the Congress in a comprehensive and

timely fashion but yet allow the Bureau to continue to conduct

its day-to-day business in as normal a manner as possible.

We believe that by creating this facility we will be able

meet the requirements of these Select Committees with the

exception of the research that will have to be done in the

substantive Divisions.

While the Project will direct internal work and

related liaison with the intelligence community and the

White House staff, we envision the Legal Analysis Unit Office

of Legal Counsel Division as continuing to be the primary

point of direct contact with the Select Committees of the

Congress.

They will receive all requests and deliver all

responses to these Committees.

In addition, they will meet

with the staffs of the Committees to insure the reasonableness

of requests.

If necessary, they will call upon the expertise

of the substantive Division for determination as to whether

a proposed request from the Committees can be responded to

within a reasonable period of time and within the capabilities

of the FBI's information retrieval systeft- 106

bility will provide Cregar and Mintz with direct liaison not

only with senior officials of the intelligence community but

also with the President's counsel.

Mr. Elmer W. Larson, Unit Chief, Training Unit, IS-3

form of our responses; identify any conflicts in FBI positions

where several Divisions are responding to a particular question;

as well as to insure the quality, completeness and adequacy

of responses to Select Committees requests.

Additionally,

Phillips will be responsible for the preparation of abstracts

to be furnished to the Interagency Registry maintained at CIA

Headquarters.

This Registry established by the Executive Committee

of the Ad Hoc Group at the suggestion of and with the concurrence

of the White House will serve as the coordinating mechanism

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Senstudy 75

Because of the White House insistence that all requests

land responses be completely coordinated and available for review

by White House representatives, it is imperative that the Project

have a self-sustained records facility to insure immediate access

to requests received from and responses furnished to the Select

Committees:

In addition, in those instances where certain FBI

documents furnished to the Select Committees must be sanitized

copies dat le imperative this records facility not only retal

the sanitized documents but also copies of the original

For these reasons a senior clerical employee has been

requested to function as a Records Manager for the Project.

In addition to the above, there will be stenographic

and clerical personnel assigned to the Project to support the

work of the Bureau Supervisors. We have not committed any more

personnel to the Project than are absolutely necessary at the

present time.

Should the requests of the Select Committees

require additional personnel, appropriate memoranda will be

submitted with

a complete justification for additional personnel

assigned to the Project.

Although the physical space for the Project is

limited, all personnel connected with Project Senstudy 75

will be located in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building. This

space is physically located within the Intelligence Division.

As a matter of interest, Mr. James Wilderotter,

Associate Counsel to the President, has requested that should

any member of the intelligence community get requests from other

Committees of the Congress which impact on the intelligence

community; could be of interest to the White House;or are of such

sensitivity that coordination is required, copies of both the

requests and an abstract of the responses should be made

available to the Interagency Registry.

ACTION:.

For information and record purposes.

BRIEFING FOR, STAFF MEMBERS

"BY INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

APRIL 11, 1975"

As you were previously advised, William Miller, Staff Director

of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, requested that we

provide a briefing for certain staff members of the Committee on the functions

of the Intelligence Division. He asked that the briefing cover both internal

security and foreign counterintelligence operations and that it provide a broad

overview of our investigative responsibilities.

1. artis

The Intelligence Division is prepared to offer a two-hour briefing

beginning at 10:00 a.m. on Friday, 4-11-75. It will include a slide show to

be followed by a general discussion and an opportunity to afford questions. and

answers. After a luncheon break, the staff members will be given a brief tour

of the Files and Communications Division.

Since the briefing will cover classified materials, no staff

members will be invited unless they have appropriate security clearances. As

a consequence Professor John Elliff, who has been tentatively named Director

of the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence, will not attend. It

is hoped that we may provzde him with a privat let fung at some later date:

"The Washington Post," Thursday, 4-10-75, edition

on page A31 contains an article reporting an interview of Senator Frank

Church, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.

Senator Church, according to this article, stated that the Committee is

reserving the right to make public eventually any documents it gets and is

accepting nothing with "strings attached."

Inasmuch as this Committee is also the Committee which the

FBI is furnishing information tod, it is believed a clarification of Senator Church's

statement must be obtained and in the interim we should furnish the Senate

Select Committee only those documents which do not have a caveat such as

classified documents or documents bearing the property stamp.

Section Chief William O. Cregar advised that he had contacted

Dr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Committee

concerning Senator Church's reported statement. Clarke stated that CIA

Director William E. Colby was highly upset at Church's remark and that

this statement would be a topic of a discussion of the Executive Committee meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review the morning of

4-11-75. We will be represented at that conference by Section Chief William O.

Cregar and Assistant Director John A. Mintz. Clarke indicated the position.

that the CIA will apparently take regarding this problem is that the White House

should obtain the clarification although CIA Director Colby initially was prepared

to send a letter over his signature to Senator Church to obtain such clarification.

REC 40 d-116375

Inasmuch as the request by this Committee was forwarded throug

the Department, Senator Church's statement was brought to the attention of

Douglas Marvin, Assistant to the Attorney General, who has been handling

all FBI responses to Senate Select Committee requests. Marvin indreated te

was concerned at Church's statement and stated it was the Attorney General's

desire that he be advised of any Bureau response to the Committee

This

of

ther

memorandum reports the results of a meeting

Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group

on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community (here-

alter referred to as the FXCOM), held at CIA Headquarters on

the

morning of 4/4/75."

This meeting was chaired by Mr. Colby in his role as

the Director of Central Intelligence. In attendance were

Mr. Roderick Hills, Assistant Counsel to the President; Associate

Deputy AG Wilderotter; Mr. John Clarke; as well as senior officials

from Defense, Treasury, National Security Council, Office of

Management and Budget,

and the Energy Research and Development

Administration.

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mr. Roderick Hills reported that he had a meeting

with the Counsel and Staff Director of the Senate Select Com

mittee (SSC) to discuss having Legal Counsel present when members

of a particular agency were being interviewed by SSC staff person-

nel.

The essence of this meeting resulted in the SSC being

receptive to such an arrangement but it would be incumbent upon

each agency, department or bureau to negotiate the specific

arrangements for such representation with the SSC. Hills also

discussed the problem of the unknown employee or former employee

who might request to be interviewed unbeknownst to the parent

agency.

It was suggested to the Counsel and Staff Director by

Hills that such an employee be interviewed by only one staff

that the staff member attempt to

the parent agency to insure the agency could provide advice

to the sensitivity of the unknown employee's testimony.. No firm

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE:

SENSTUDY 75

testimony of a secret employee and following such testimony

the employee will be allowed to meet with staff members of

the SSC in an Executive Session. It is anticipated more

definitive information on the final decisions regarding this

aspect will be forthcoming from the White House.

The question was raised by the Bureau representative

Is to whether the Ad Hoc Group and/or the interagency registry

hould be notified as to requests members of the Intelligenc

Community receive from other Congressional committees.

Mr.

Wilderotter advised that this would be a judgment question;

however, if a request from a Congressional committee other

• than

the Select Committees impacted on the Intelligence Community,

involve sensitive issues or would be of interest to the White

House, such requests should be provided to the interagency

Iregistry along with an abstract of the response.

Attached is a list of those members of the SSC staff

who have been certified for access to compartmented information.

Also attached is a paper identifying 10 issues likely to grow

out of Select Committee

deliberations. The pencil notation in

the right-hand column identifies those agencies of the Intelli-

gence Community responsible for preparing a paper which addresses

these issues.

It is noted that issue identified as number eight

is entitled,

that the FBI prepare this paper. Assistant Director Mintz advised

that the Bureau has a study underway on this very subject and

"Intelligence Files and Privac bired sub deadlin

agreed that the Bureau would prepare this study. The deadline

for completion of the study is 4/25/75.

Also attached is a copy of the survey of the SSC facility,

Room G-308, Dirksen Building, covering all aspects of physical and

technical security. None of

the participants of the EXCOM had

any

objection to the facility and we presume the SSC will abide by

the procedures outlined in the attached survey report.

Attached also for information is a draft of an employee

notice and agreement concerning treatment of confidential material

being considered by the SSC.

It is to be noted that to date neither

the Committeenor its staff has signed any such Secrecy Agreement.

Washington, D. G..

1: In response to a request from Mr. Ben Marshall, Security

Director,

Senate 'Select Committee, (tele. 224-1700). Messrs.

Nicholas R. Zubon and Robert E. Burgener conducted a comprehensive

security survey of the Senate. Select Committee's Facility on

24 March 19.75.

2. Mr. Marshall provided both a comprehensive tour of the

facility and a detailed explanation of the operation.

3.

The following are pertinent facts concerning the security

prócedures as related to the Senate Select Committee Facility:

A.: Type of Facility

The Committee is in the auditorium (Room G. 308) of the Dirksen

Building at 1st and C Streets; N. E., Washington, D. C. . Access to

the auditorium is

gained easiest by entering the

building from the

Ist and C Streets entrance.

A 24-hour guard post is located just

inside this entrance.'

The Select Committee facility is 40' east

of the building.

cludes the auditorium entrance door from being visible. The

entrance to the

auditorium is protected by a 24-hour guard post.

The auditorium (Room G. 308) is approximately 100' long x 45'

wide.

in which the air handling equipment and sundry other service

components are housed. All major air handling equipment is on

the roof above the auditorium.

Access to the

roof which is strictly

controlled by the Director of Security, is gained by a stairway

in the southeast corner of the auditorium.

The sidewalls: each have

a 2'. X. 3' register approximately. 12' above the floor through which

HH 55118 DocId:32989628 Page 144

---

## Page 145

air is passed from the auditorium to the air handling equip-

ment on the roof. These registers are solidly bolted into

the walls.

The front of the auditorium (south wall) is covered by

a large movie screen.

To the right and left of the movie

screen are two rooms 6' wide and approximately 15' long used

by the research section clerical personnel.

These rooms

have countertop openings approximately 3' above the floor

for access from within the auditorium.

Countertop openings

exist along both sidewalls th approximately three quarters

of the length of the wall.

sidewalls have intercorridors

on the opposite side of the countertops which have been con-

verted into unpartitioned office space.. The only reproduction

machine, a xerox model 3100; is located in the west corridor.

The east corridor has been converted into a compartmented

information storage room and a compartmented document reading

room.

The Security Director indicated that he may move his

office to the head of the compartmented reading room to provide

a larger measure of access control to this sensitive

area.

The auditorium has six wooden exterior doors, 7' high and

• 3" thick.

The entrance door into the auditorium

(west and

north wall) will have an electrical push-button lock installed.

A similar door in the east end of the north wall will be barred

and bracketed on the inside to prevent unauthorized entry..

The

west wall has 2 exterior doors leading into the Capitol

• Police

offices.

The

east wall has two exterior doors with

one leading

to the

roof while the

second door. exits into the Capitol Police

Garage.

All exterior doors will be alarmed.

The doors now

have Yale 197 1/4 locks with the keys controlled by Mr. Marshall.

The fire safety factor concerning these locked doors was dis-

cussed with him.

The auditorium has a small second floor area at the north

end. Access is gained by two stairways on the east and west

side of the auditorium. The second floor space consists of a

large projection room, currently filled with projection equip-

ment, and five small private film viewing rooms.

The five small

rooms will be converted into witness inter-

view rooms.

The windows in each of these rooms will be covered

during the stay of the Select Committee in the auditorium.

B. Access Controls

Access to the Dirksen Building is gained by either the

main entrance on Ist and C Streets, ground level, or the

Basement Tunnel Entrance at the rear of the building.

entrances have a 24-hour guard post where persons entering

are checked for identification.

Brief cases and packages

are processed through x-ray machines. Vendors entering the

main entrance are checked for ID, however, all boxes are not

checked.

Entry into the auditorium is controlled by a guard at the

door. His instructions are that all persons entering must

show an ID card.

Visitors are permitted only by appointment.

They are logged in and escorted

at all times while in the

auditorium.

From 1800 hours Friday through 0800 hours Saturday,

and from 1300 hours Saturday to 07.00 hours Monday everyone must :

sign the log in and out and show an ID.

In the event an access

problem arises at the guard post, regardless of the hour, Mr.

Marshall is alerted.

C. Guards

The Dirksen Building and the auditorium are protected by

members of the U. S. Capitol Police Department.

The Building

has

two 24-hour/7day-a-week guard posts at the entrances while

the Senate Select Committee has one 24-hour/7 day-a-week guard

post at the

entrance and an after-hours roving patrol inside

the auditorium.

All police officers are well trained, weax

the Capitol Police uniform and carry Smith and Wesson 38 caliber

revolvers.. After-hour patrols check all doors, the entixe

auditorium for classified material that may not have been

secured, and the second floor hourly during the night. The

guards on duty at the time of the survey were alert and

supervisors make

guard

posts during each shift. In addition the guard at the

stationary post has. four telephones, two of which have

a pickup

and automatic ring feature with Capitol Police Headquarters.

There will be no rotation of police officers during

The documents in the

Remington Rand safes can be drawn by anyone on the staff, but

must be receipted for with the Registry. Officer.

The documents

are to be read on the tables placed there for that purpose in

the Research Section.

Further control of classified documents is directed through

the

assigning. of a staff employee given responsibility for the

reproduction of documents on the xerox machine.

He will. con-

trol the number of copies made on typewriters.

All classified material is secured in safes at the end of

the working day.

H. Classified Waste

It is estimated that one 50-pound bag of classified waste.

will be generated each week while the Committee is in session.

Once the bag is filled with classified waste,

it will be

placed in the locked trunk of Mr. Marshall's automobile and

taken to the Federal Reserve Building incinerator where he

will witness destruction by burning.

In the event this incin-

erator is booked to capacity, he will take the classified waste

and burn it at the D. C. incinerator.

Should either incin-

erator become unavailable to the Committee,

• Mx. Marshall was

assured that CIA would consider assisting him in the secure

disposition of Committee classified waste.

I. Compartmented/TS Storage

A room dedicated as the codeword/IS storage room is in

the northeast corner of the auditorium. Its five walls are

solid masonry ranging from 6" to 8" thick.. A 1/8" stainless

steel

door frame is bolted to the masonry wall's.

A pre-

fabricated 9

gage wire cross-patch metal frame door is attached

to the

stee'l

frame serving as access control to the dedicated

room.

The door will be secured by lock and key once classified

material arrives for storage.

This room will be alarmed.

telephone instruments. will disconnect all telephones

simultaneously, should the need arise.

The telephone system

is maintained by the local telephone company.

K. .

Security Briefings

All new members of the committee receive a thorough

briefing from Mr. Marshall on security procedures and

security responsibilities. Briefings are periodically

reinforced when conditions warrant..

Mr.

Marshall

double checks

behind them. The custodian,

Security Director and the

roving guard patrol check the entire auditorium to ensure

all classified material has been secured at the end of the

day.

M. Counteraudio Inspection

Mr. Marshall has taken action on this requirement and

continues to monitor this area to provide the Committee

with as much security protection against the Audio threat

as possible..

N. Shredder

The facility has one Destroyit Model 51 Shredder used

only for shredding the most sensitive documents.

Other

documents are not shredded in this machine because of its

limited

shredding capability.

0. General Observations

The security procedures implemented within the Senate.

environment for the protection of classified materials.

The

survey officers were

pleased with the security director's

dedication to the

objective of providing the best security

possible for the Committee.

NOTES FOR SESSION

AZY NONENCHRLAT

EDMAIN I3 UNOSASS.

1188

In previous sessions we discussed the importance of

highlighting issues likely.to grow.out.of Commission.on

Committee deliberations.

We observed that we should identify

isome of those on which a legal brief or annex would be helpful

to Executive Branch initiatives.

The idea was to select a

few where a solid research paper with options, pros and cons,

etc., could help us develop a firm grip on the questions in

issue and identify options.

For example, the question of

-Executive.privacy presents. itself, and I.gather is being:

worked on.

There are others we feel it would be useful for the group

to address

and assign responsibility for further work. For

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of

the Intelligence Community (hereafter referred to as the

Group), held at CIA Headquarters on the morning of 4/2/75.

The study prepared for the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) entitled, "Human Intel-

ligence," has come to the attention of the Senate Select

Committee (SSC).

The major contributors to this report were

the FBI and CIA. It is an extremely sensitive document and

for that reason

any requests from any committees of the

Congress for copies of this report should be referred to the

White House.

At the present time, the consensus of those

persons in

the White House dealing with the subject of release

of information to the committees of Congress is that this

report will not be provided Congressional committees at this

time.

The SSC does recognize a requirement to comply with

the Third Agency Rule which states in effect that classified

information or material originating in one department shall

not be disseminated outside any other department to which it

has been made available without the consent of the originatin.

department. CIA's General Counsel has produced a paper entitled

"The Third Agency Rule," copy attached, which they have requested

be reviewed by the Legal Counsels of all agencies making up the

Intelligence Community.

A copy of CIA's paper referred to above

has been made available to Assistant Director Mintz who has

indicated he will be in direct siC ift with Mr. Warner, CIA's

General Counsel.

A copy of these guidelines has been furnished to the Freedom

of Information Unit of the Legal Counsel Division for review.

Their comments will be furnished to the Bureau's representative,

Mr. Frank Schwartz, on the USIB Committee in compliance with

the mandate from the Ad Hoc Group.

Also attached is a copy of the abstract which all

agencies of the Intelligence Community are being required to

use in abstracting information that agency has provided one

of the select Committees.

These abstracts will be retained

members of the Intelligence Community as well as the White

HousE.

The purpose of this interagency registry is to have

available in one location all information in abstract form

that

members of the Intelligence Community have provided the

ssC.

The Third Agency Rule

DocId: 32989628

1. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was

included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked.

Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense

information originating in another Department or agency" to an

agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the

consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep

bon to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority

of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authörizes...

the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli-

gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate

dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where

appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate

intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is

the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-

nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is ay homogenous

product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the

receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.

3. Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executive Order

11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not

specifically cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the

following controls: Sec..9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The

originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in

conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with

respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information

and material, including those which presently relate to communications

intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order

11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security

Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi-

fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This

-directive does not contain the term "third agency rule" but does have

four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to what

historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:

A. (2) Determination of Need-to-Know. In addition to a

security clearance, a person must have a need for access

to the particular classified information or material sought

in connection with the performance of his official duties or

Page 168

ENCLOSURE

162-116395668

## Page 169

tractual obligations. The deter

nation of thạt need

shall be made by officials having responsibility for the

classified information or material.

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination

by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section

102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50

U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating

in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any

other Department to which it has been made available

without the consent of the originating Department.

E. Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.

Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING

NOTICE -- SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND

METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any

manner outside authorized channels without the permission

of the originating Department and an assessment by the

senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department

as to the potential risk to the national security and to the

intelligence sources and methods involved.

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The

establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri-

bution and protection of classified införmation and material

under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior

approval of the head of a Department or his designee.

5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are

received from all members of the Intelligence Community and

then disseminated to members of the community under the

authority of the DCI;

(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State

Department may not be sent by the State Department to

the Department of Commerce without the permission of the

CIA;

(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's

Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or

to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,

a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA

information should be referred to CIA for action so that

the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

HW.,55118 DooId:32989628 Page 169

## Page 170

(d)

If the Navy Department discusses one of its operations

with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation

in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has

received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc-

tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part

of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would

not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate

intelligence.

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Ad Hoc Group

SUBJECT:

Handling of Third Agency Matters in Response

to Congressional Select Committees

'CONTAT

1. As you are aware, Senator Church already has submitted

to me a long list of materials which he requests be provided to his

Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with

Respect to Intelligence Activities. He has submitted other lists to

the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the White House.. It is

expected that other elements of the Intelligence Community will

be hearing from Senator Church.

2. The scope of the investigation necessarily is going to

involve Third Agency relationships to a considerable degree.

3. In the implementation of Executive Order 11652,

"Classification and Declassification of National Security Information

and Material, " the President directed the following:

• "D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination

by Recipient.

Except as otherwise provided by Section 102

of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S. C.

403, classified information or material originating in one

Department shall not be disseminated outside any other

Department to which it has been made available without the

consent of the originating department."

4. As regards Section 102 of the 1947 Act, the following

quotes 102 (e) in full:

"(3) To the extent recommended by the National Security

Council and approved by the President, such intelligence

of the departments and agencies of the Government, except

as hereinafter provided, relating to the national security,

shall be open to the inspection of the Director of Central

Intelligence, and such intelligence as relates

to the

national security and is possessed by such departments and

other agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter

provided, shall be made available to the Director of

Central Intelligence for correlation, evaluation and

dissemination: Provided, however, that upon the written

request of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Director

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall make available

to the Director of Central Intelligence such information .

for correlation, evaluation and dissemination as may be

essential to the national security. "

5. If I am requested to provide certain materials and

investigation indicates that the material asked for involves a document

which originated within an organization other than the Intelligence

Community Staff or the Central Intelligence Agency, the requestor

will be asked to redirect his inquiry to the office of origin..

6. It already is apparent, however, that the documentation

being requested inevitably is going to include references to inter-

relationships among various of the elements of the intelligence

. community.

Clearing

each and every such reft ence with arcry

agency mentioned could manifestly be extremely consuming of time

and manpower.

?. I propose the Ad Hoc Group agree on the following procedure.

Where it appears that truly sensitive matters are involved, the

material will be sanitized by the agency concerned and a check will

be made with the appropriate Third Agency organizations before

release. Where the reference concerns a Third Agency indirectly

or is not considered sensitive and does not pose policy concerns, the

agency concerned may forward the material to the requesting Select

mention-by-mention clearance

material has been forwarded will be made to the central index and

all agencies alerted through that mechanism. Agencies will

designate on their submissions to the central index, the name and

telephone number of the releasing party.

8. Ad hoc members should be prepared to discuss and

come to some agreement on this matter at the next meeting.

SUBJECT:

Sanitization Guidelines for Documents

Provided Congressional Select

Committees

1. Attached is a copy of a statement, "Guidelines for

Sanitizing Certain Documents Provided Select Committees''

prepared by the Chairman, USIB Security Committee, for

consideration by the Ad Hoc Group. This step is a follow on to

the understanding the DCI has with Senator Church that sanitization

of selective documents will be undertaken before the documents'

are released to the Committee. Similar understandings have been

discussed with House Staff as well.

2. It is important that, to the extent possible, all intelligence

organizations follow generally the same sanitization guidelines.

Accordingly, the USIB. Ad Hoc Group should consider utilizing these

or similar guidelines within their respective organizations.

3. If requested by the Chairman, the DCI will discuss

orally with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate and House

Select.Committees the content of the sensitive USIB or CIA material

excised from documents. Where appropriate, the DCI may discuss

this sensitive material with the entire Select Committee. He

considers it essential that the written record provided to the

Committee staff not include such sensitive information for the

protection of intelligence sources and methods.

DRAFT

28 MARCHES

GUIDELINES FOR SANITIZING CERTAIN DOCUMENTS

• PROVIDED SELECT COMMITTEES

1. The Director of Central Intelligence has recently discussed

with Senator Church the need for special consideration and treatment

by the Select Committee of certain sensitive aspects of intelligence

activities and the Senator has expressed his recognition of this need.

• Included in such matters are the identities of sensitive sources, the

material provided to the United States by cooperating foreign

intelligence

services, the details of technical devices and systems

and of operational methods, the identities of certain employees whose

safety could be jeopardized if revealed, the identities of American

citizens and organizations who have cooperated with US intelligence

and some additional materials the public disclosure of which would

create serious foreign policy or national security problems. Such

material should be protected not only from exposure but indeed the.

risk of exposure. Further, recognition should be given to the need

to protect certain other information which, if improperly disclosed,

might impair the privacy rights of individuals.

## Page 176

2. One form of this special consideration may include use

of sanitization procedures to avoid the risk of exposing such matters

and at the same time satisfy the Select Committee's need for a full

understanding of the community's activities.

3.

What May Be Sanitized

While it is not possible to anticipate all requirements which

may be levied by the Committees for documentin

g material and not

possible to determine specifically what material should be excised

from these documents, the following illustrations are offered in

certain likely categories. The criteria in all cases should meet

the test mentioned above.

4. Collection of Intelligence

(a) The Committee will probably address the matter of how.

intelligence activities or methods have or may impinge upon individual

rights. Documents supporting responses may be sanitized by removal

of identities of sensitive agents and informants, covert personnel,

and contractual cover arrangements. A descriptive phrase may be.

substituted, i.e., a foreign journalist, a political official in the

opposition party. No sanitization should be used in connection with

= Z

HV 55118: DocId: 32989628 Page 176

---

## Page 177

names of individuals whose employment or former employment by,

or association with a department or agency, does not remain secret

or for individuals whose present or future activities on behalf of the

department or agency do not require that previous cover arrangements

remain secret.

(b) Some information may be required with respect to

technical intelligence systems including cryptologic and communications

activities and reconnaissance capabilities. Almost all of such material

is currently handled in compartmentation control channels under

various codewords or nicknames. No security threat is perceived

by release of these codenames or nicknames in documents. Details

of the technical systems involved, contractual arrangements, funding

and/or names of companies or consultants whose participation was

obtained under agreement of continued secrecy may be excised from

documents. Any question on release of codeword material should be

referred to the Program Manager who in turn may consult with the

Director of Central Intelligence to ensure a consistent approach in

the community's sanitization procedure. While documentary samples

of intelligence obtained by technical means may be used in support of

verbal testimony, no raw product should be provided the Committees

HH 55118

DocId: 32989628

Page 177

---

## Page 178

' for retention. If absolutely required by the Committees, sanitization

of such raw product should be conducted to mask the degree of

technical capabilities.

•5. Intelligence Estimates

Finished intelligence reports of departments and agencies and

"estimates do not usually contain source identifications and will not

normally require sanitization. However, departments and agencies

' should review such publications to ensure deletion of source identities.

6. Administration

Information concerning the internal administration arrangements

of intelligence agencies may be requested. This may include staffing

chart with occupants identified. Sanitization of individual, Identities

of personnel formerly not under cover and now functioning-in a cover

assignment should be deleted as well as those who may in the future

be considered for a covert assignment.

7.

General

The following categories of information or specific examples

may arise in any number of circumstances in documentation requested

by the Select Committees. In all cases, serious consideration should

be given by the department or agency concerned to the necessity of

(b) Details which would reveal the effectiveness of sensitive

methods and techniques (1) employed overseas in-human-source-

collection, (2) employed for the physical security protection of the

organizations.

(d) The success or failure of recruitment attempts in any

given targetted foreign organization.

(e) Names of particular employees whose physical safety or

future career might be placed in jeopardy by exposure.

(f) Foreign or US sources, official or otherwise who agreed

to cooperate under terms of explicit or implied confidentiality, who

would be embarrassed or endangered by disclosure of their role.

What Should Not Be Sanitized

There are general categories of intelligence activities which

have already been placed in the public domain by the mass news media

or authors with background experience in intelligence departments

or agencies of the community. Names, places, dates and events

which have been so revealed should not be excised if contained in

requested documents.

released under the Freedom of Information Act. No further sanitization

Lof this material should be conducted unless it relates to an individual's

rights to privacy.

9.

Techniques of Sanitization

Sanitization of intelligence material is usually considered the

act of physical removal of the identity of a person, place or thing

from written communication with or without regard for the residual

7

Nif 55118 DocId: 32989628°

## Page 182

content:

Use of a substitution device, either pseudonym or ident

is an example of sanitization which permits intelligent continuity

of the material without revealing the true identity. Sanitization

does not extend to the use of false or misleading substitute material

in this context.

The integrity of official records must be maintained.. The

following sanitization techniques apply only to copies of records.

(a) Physical Sanitization - Names may be cut out and

the residual material xeroxed and submitted to Committees. Names

may be masked with correction tape and then xeroxed. The xerox

copy may be submitted to the Committees.

(b) Names may be deleted and replaced with "IDEN, "

The delted materialis pravided an a separate IDEN list which

contains names or descriptive phrases substituted for deletions.

(c) The material can be retyped or reprinted with

substitute phrases or substitute descriptions which do not reveal

the sensitive material.

(d) Entire pages can be removed from some documents

and replaced with a blank page carrying only reference information

## Page 183

as to the location of the sensitive material within the contributing

department or agency. This technique may be employed when

physical sanitization or excision of material results in unintelligible

gibberish as residue..

(e) Within a category of inquiry, it may be desirable to

extract a complete document from requested material when the

request is broad and all inclusive within its field. The existence

of such a document should be made known to the Committees but

retained by the agency or department for: review under escort

of a representative of the department or agency.

:10. Management of Sanitization

The original record and a copy of the sanitized version provided

-should-be.readilyavailable.inall-cases-Materials-developedwithin.an

agency or department in response to requests should be reviewed at an

appropriate level for completeness, responsiveness and accuracy. In

the case of documents or materials of a community nature, the release

should be done in coordination with the departments or agencies and/or

the Program Manager concerned and any sanitization should be agreed

upon during coordination.

## Page 184

-..

This proposed use of sanitization as a special arrangement.

to protect selected issues contained in material provided to Select

Committees by one agency may prove to be a futile exercise if not

practiced in common by all participating departments and agencies.

It is essential to the proposal that departments and agencies attempt

to employ the same criteria for sanitization and coordinate as

required.. This paper can serve only as general guidelines on

sanitization.

SENSTUDY 75

By memorandum dated 3-20-75, you were advised of a

request received from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.

The Intelligence Division requested that an attempt be made to modify portions

of the Committee's request.

Telephone Rm. -

Director Sec'y -

Regarding Part I titled Legal Authorities, the Intelligence Division

pointed out that this particular request was wide-ranging and required a considerable

file review as it requested any memorandum discussing the legal authority of

the FBI to (1) investigate internal security matters, (2) collect intelligence

information, and (3) engage in counter-intelligence activities; together with

copies of all constitutional and statutory provisions, executive orders, presidential

directives, Attorney General opinions and memoranda, and any other materials

asserted as sources of such authority." With regard to Part III concerning the

FBI's administrative organization, they requested the identities by name of personnel

in the Intelligence Division, Unit Chief and above. This caused concern in the

Intelligence Division that there would be a needless proliferation of a list of

Bureau personnel working in this field which list, of course, would be of interest

to foreign intelligence sources.

On 4-1-75 Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly discussed

these matters with William Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Select Committee;

John T. Elliff, who has been nominated to head the task force for the Committee

looking into FBI activities; F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to the Senate Select

Committee; and staff member Michael Epstein. They agreed to modify the request

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo

RE: SENSTUDY 75

With regard to Part I relating to legal authorities, they stated

they were amenable to the Bureau furnishing them whatever documents they

have retrieved up to this time which have been recovered pursuant to their

request of 3-19-75 and that no additional detailed review need be conducted

until they review the aforementioned documents. At the end of their review

they will make any additional specific requests concerning this part of their

request. They also asked that in our response we furnish them copies of documents

listed on a three-page paper prepared by the staff of the Senate Select Committee,

a copy of which is attached.

Staff Director Miller requested that the Bureau expedite their

response to the Senate Select Committee's request as the first meeting of that

Committee is scheduled for WednesdaY 4-9-75,and he felt strongly that they

must have material that showed progress in their study of the FBI prior to that

time. Mr. Miller requested that, if necessary, the request be responded to in

a piecemeal basis and that the complete response does not necessarily have to

be made at one time.

It is suggested that we make available to this Committee as soon

as possible those documents which we have furnished the General Accounting

Office (GAO) which also fall within the 3-19-75 request of the Senate Select

Committee. In this regard staff members have advised they are in contact with

GAO auditors concerning the FBI.

By way of observations it is obvious that the staff members of

the Committee are well versed in Bureau policy and procedures. To this point

they have been cooperative and we should insure that we give a timely response

to their various requests.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Intelligence Division advise whether modification

of the Senate Select Committee's request concerning legal authorities for

investigations and the modification of the table of organization of the Intelligence

Division are acceptable and, if so, expeditiously prepare the necessary response

to the Senate Select Committee.

Director Sec'y —

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend that all

responses for the production of records, etc., received from Congressional

committees be forwarded by letterhead memorandum through the Deputy

Attorney General to the requesting committee, and also that in selected instances

a property stamp or statement be affixed to certain documents limiting access

With the proliferation of committees in Congress looking into

FBI operations, it is essential that a standard procedure for the forwarding o

documents to the requesting committees be established. Inasmuch as requests

such as the request of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

have been forwarded to this Bureau through the Department, it would appear

logical that responses to such inquiries and all other inquiries of Congressional !

committees, whether they be directed to the Department and/or the Bureau,

be responded to through the Department. Such a procedure not only will make

all our responses consistent but will also give the Department an opportunity

(review and approve documents being made available to Congress.

In connection with our preparation of responses to requests df

Congressional committees, it is suggested that all responses should be by

letterhead memorandum, the first paragraph of which should clearly describe

the specific request which is being responded to in the letterhead memorandura,

REC:18 62-116.395-

In those instances

ére documents are of a nature that weare:

not desirous of unauthorized personnel, whether they be in Congress or otherwise,

having access to, we should affix a property stamp.

'This property"stampshould.

read as follows:

17 APR 11 1975

"This document is prepared in response to your request and

is not for dissemination outside of your Committee. Its use

is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the

contents may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel .without

the express approval of the FBI.

APPENDIX

B

PERIODS OF PREDOMINANT MILITARY

NTERESIS, NOT INVOLVING MARTIAL LAW

I.

In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as

potential theaters of operation. When an armed forces commander

of such a potential theater is designated, he definitely has

interest in, though not control of, the civilian life within the

area.

In order that the armed. forces commander may prepare him-

self for the discharge of the possible responsibility which may

affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon:

1. Agents of the FBI; of ONI; ID, Army; and the OSI, IG,

U.S. Air Force will continue to function in accordance with the

provisions of Sections II, III, IV, and V.

In addition therero, the armed forces commander may take

steps to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the

manner in which complete coverage will be obtained if martial law

is declared.

Adequate Liaison with the other subscribing agencies

will insure

that the armed forces commander will have the benetit

of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the representatives

of the other agencies.

3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and

receive such information from the other three agencies as he may

desire and they may be able to furnish.

II. The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the

coverage furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any

additional coverage each subscribing agency can undertake.

When

the commander feels that more complete coverage is required, it

is recognized that he is authorized to augment the coverage with

such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his

jurisdiction.

Prior to any invasion of the spheres nörmally

coming under

the coonizance of the other subscribing agencies

the armed forces commander should obtain the necessary authority

from the Secretary of Defense.

III. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations

have placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces

commander, Whenever any of the other services feel that such

a survey to determine adequacy of coverage should be undertaken,

it should be so recommended.

(a) Special Agents in Chargé of the Federal Bureau of

• Investigation Divisional Offices, Military Intelligence VIIICers

of the pertznent Armies, District Officers of the office of

Special Investigations, Inspector General, U.S. Air Force, and

Naval District Intelligence Officars will meintain close personal

liaison between those offices and their representatives, including

a meeting of representatives of the four agencies, preferably the

officers in charge, at least twice per month, for

the purpose of

discussing pending

and contempiated investigative activities, and

any other subject necessary to insure that there is proper co-

ordination of their investigative work.

(b) The close personal liaison to be maintained

between representatives of the four agencies at all times should

insure that there is not duplication of effort in any field, and

that a proper coverage of the whole investigative field is main-

tained.

Particular attention should be paid to avoiding any

duplication in connection with the use of informers.

(c) A distinction should be recognized between the

Investigative

interest of irdividual agencies and the coverage

interest.

It is believed that all four agencies should study,

from time to time, the coverage of the investigative field in

order to insure that all channels of interest and avenues of

information are adequately covered by at least one of the partici-

pating agencies.

(d) Where there is doubt as to whether or not one of the

other agencies is interested in information collected, it should

be transmitted to the other agency.

INVESTIGATIVE GUIDELINES

TITLE XI, ORGANIZED CRIME CONTROL ACT OF 1970

REGULATION OF EXPLOSIVES

1. General

Title XI of the captioned law amends Title 18, United

States Code, by adding a new chapter 40 with section numbers 841

through 848 governing the importation, manufacture, distribution

and storage of explosive materials and creating certain Federal

ortenses pertaining to the unlawful use of explosives. ' Administration

of explosives regulation is vested in the Secretary of the Treasury

as is invescinative jurisaiccion over the unlawful acts proscribed

in section 842.

Under authority contained in section 846 the

rederal bureau of Investigacion (rBl) and the Bureau of Alcohol:

Tobacco and Firearms (Alf) have concurrent investigative jurisdic-

cion as to the remainder of chapter 40, 1.e., the unlawful acts

proscribed in subsections (d), (e), (f): (g), (h) and (1) of seccion

844.

Although not specified in chapter 40, the Postal Inspection

•Servico shall have jurisdiction iù investiyaie ail ircidenis

involving explosive or incendiary devices sent through the mails

or directed against U.S. Postal Service property.

Title XI greatly broaders Federal- auchority pertaining to

explosives-connected offenses.

At the same time, Congress has

expressly disclaimed any intent to occupy the field to the exclusion

of state law on the same subject matter.

To effect both Congressional

purposes and to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort it is

essential that the limited Federal investigative resources be carefully

allocated, particularly in cases in which both the ATF and the FBI

have jurisdiction.

2. Federal bureau of Investigation (FBI Jurisdiction in General

(a) Effect on prior jurisdiction - This agreement applies

only to those incidents as to which the FBI had no investigative

jurisdiction prior to the enactment of the captioned Taw and to

incidents previously subject to FBI invastigation by reason of chapter

65, Title 18, United States Code (malicious mischief). Investigative

procedures in other types of incidents (e.g., train wrecking, damaging

aircraft and motor vehicles, racketeering) shall remain unchanged.

Division of the Department of Justice. If ATF or the Postal

Inspection Service has properly initiated investigations and infor-

mation is subsequently developed indicating apparent involvement of

Department of Justice that a transfer of responsibilities will

unduly impair further investigative efforts.

The FBI will immediately in offer as anse lates od unversistes -

4.: Postal Inspection Service Jurisdiction

The Postal Inspection Service shall have primary juris-

diction to investigate all violations of section 844 which are

directed at U.S. Postal Service property or functions:

5. Special Considerations

(a) Bomb Threats, false information (section 894(e)) -

The ATF and the Postal Inspection Service shall have jurisdiction

over violations of section 844(e) against Treasury Department or

Postal Service property or functions, respectively.

The FBI shall

have jurisdiction over all other violations of section 844(e). Upon

receipt of information alleging or suggesting a violation of subsection

844(e), the investigative agency concerned will review available

information to determine whether the identity of the offender is

known or can be readily ascertained and, if not, whether the evidence

suggests a partern or pian of such offenses by à parcicular offerier

or against a particular victim.

If such a patter appears or if the

offender is identified, all available information will be disseminated

as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

(b) Use/carrying explosive in conmission of a felony.

(section 844(h)) - Violations of 844(h) should be handled as an

adjunct of the felony from which they arise and should be discussed

with the appropriate United States Attorney or Division of the

Depariment handling prosecution of the underlying felony offense.

The agency having jurisdiction over the underlying felony will have

investigative jurisdiction over the 844(h) violation (e.g., bank

robbery is under FBI jurisdiction).

(c) Violations of 26 U.S.C. 5861 (destructive devices) -

In incidents involving alleged violations or 18 U.S.c. 844 (which

may also involve a violation of 26 U.S.C. 5861), ATF shall not

exercise its primary jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. 5861 involving

destructive devices, but the incident shall be treated in accordance.

with the provisions of these guidelines.

This is in no way a

relinguishment oy ATF of its investigative jurisdiction under Title

Il of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

5. Development of Background Information

Some incidents such as those directed against Federal

property or functions (paragraph 2(b) above) require immediate full

federal investigation.

Others require a more circumspect approach

and will result in full Federal irvestigation only after considera-

tion of factors pertinent to the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.

Accordingly, in those incidents which these guidelines do not prescribe

immediate full investigation, the investigative agency having juris-

diccion will develop background information which includes (a) facts

bearing on motivation such as involvement of the suspected perpatrators

in terrorist/revolutionary activities, organized crime, labor-management

disputes, or racial-religious hate activities; (b) the applicability

of state

and local laws and likelihood of state or local investigative

and prosecutive actions; and (c) any other available facts indicating

whether or not the offense warrants Federal investigation and prosecu

tion.

Such background information will be submitted telephonically

(202~739-2745) or by teletype (710-822-0008) to the General Crimes

Section ne the criminal Division and to the appropriate

United States

Actorney. The Criminal Division will advise the investigative agency

concerned whether the matter warrants submission to any other

Division or Section of the Criminal Division, and when so warranted

the Criminal Division will transmit the information to such other

Division er Section.

% Full Investigation

A full investigation will be initiated immediately in

those instances wherein such investigation is specified herein.

other inscances full investigation will be initiated only upon direc-

cos merel,

In

tion of the Department of Justice after consideration by the Division

having cognizance over the matter of the background information

developed under paragraph 6 above.

8. Reports

Copies of case reports prepared in matters investigated under

these guidelines will be furnishad directly to the Department of Justice

and the appropriate United States Attorney. All investigative agencies

NH 55118 DocId: 32989628 Page 223

## Page 224

shall submit initial reports as soon as practicable to the Department

of Justice and shall submit progress reports once each 30 days or

as soon thereafter as possible.

The Criminal Division of the

Department of Justice will be informed as soon as possible in each

instance wherein an investigative agency initiates an investigation

under section 844. Such notification is of critical importance to

the avoidance of duplication of investigative activities. Also

agency subscribing to these guidelines shall, upon instituting invas-

tigation regarding possible violations of section 844, immediately

notify other subscribing agencies having a logical interest therein.

Also, a sufficient level of follow-up liaison and dissemination shall

be maintained to avoid duplication of investigative effort.

Additionally, each such agency will exchange information

on a

timely basis and in a manner which will not interfere with

ongoing investigations relative to types, scurces, movement, and

storage of explosives which are the subject of its investigations.

Information regarding significant developments in investigations

being conducted under these guidelines and information of an intelli-

gence nature developed incidontal to investigatione mich is or logical

interest to the Department of Justice shall be furnished promptly to

the Criminal Division of that Department which will be responsible

for any necessary further dissemination within that Department.

9. Review of Guidelines .

These guidelines shall be reviewed on a continuing basis by

the parties hereto to determine whether problems exist in their admin-

istration which should be alleviated or whether modification of any of

the terms of the agreement are needed in the interests of better law

enforcement.

The statement in the attached of the Third Agency

rule is accurate and does not present legal problems.

As an observation paragraph number 7 of the

document titled "Handling of Third Agency Matters in Response to

Congressional Select Committee" dated March 28, 1975, (attached)

appears to be subject to various interpretations. This paragraph and

in particular the second sentence of the paragraph appears to allow the

agency receiving the Committee's request to respond in instances where

a Third Agency is indirectly involved and the material is sensitive with-*

out first contacting the Third Agency. Any notification of the Third

Agency in this instance of the furnishing of such information to the

Committee would be after the fact. The term indirectly is not defined.

Additionally, this paragraph allows the Agency receiving the Committee's

request to respond in instances where a Third Agency is directly involved

and the material is nonsensitive without checking with the Third Agency

involved. It would appear the language in paragraph number 7 should

be tightened up and the appropriate terms defined.

The Third Agency Rule

24202

IIV

I. As early as November 1953, the third agency rule was

included in Executive Order 10501, which has now been revoked.

Section 7(c) prohibited the dissemination of "classified defense

information originating in another Department or agency" to an

agency "outside the receiving Department or agency without the :

consent of the originating Department or agency". The only excep-

tion to this rule is that dissemination may be made under the authority

of Section 102 of the National Security Act. This section authörizes .

the Director of Central Intelligence "to correlate and evaluate intelli-

gence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate

dissemination of such intelligence within the Government using, where

appropriate, existing agencies and facilities".

2. Historically, the responsibility of the DCI to disseminate

intelligence has referred to "finished intelligence". This product is

the end result of contributions from members of the Intelligence Commu-

nity. Therefore, in this situation the finished product is ay homogenous

product and therefore the approval for further dissemination beyond the

receiving agency must come from the Central Intelligence Agency.

3.

Executive Order 10501 was superseded by Executiva Ürder

11652 which became effective 1 June 1972. This Executive order did not

specifically .cover the third agency rule. However, it does provide the

following controls: Sec.. 9. Special Departmental Arrangements. The

originating Department or other appropriate authority may impose, in

conformity with the provisions of this order, special requirements with

respect to access, distribution and protection of classified information

and material, including those which presently relate to communications

intelligence, intelligence sources and methods and cryptography.

4. In anticipation of the implementation of Executive Order

11652, a directive was issued on May 17, 1972 entitled "National Security

Council Directive Governing the Classification, Downgrading, Declassi-

fication and Safeguarding of National Security Information". This

-directive does not contain the term "third agency rule" but does have

four subsections which relate to procedures which are similar to whai

historically had been called the third agency rule. These sections are:

HH 55118 DocId: 32989628

tractual obligations. The dete:

nation of that need

shall be made by officials having responsibility for the

classified information or material.

D. Consent of Originating Department to Dissemination

by Recipient. Except as otherwise provided by Section

102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50

U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating

in one Department shall not be disseminated outside any

other Department to which it has been made available

without the consent of the originating Department.

Dissemination of Sensitive Intelligence Information.

Information or material bearing the notation "WARNING

NOTICE - SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND

METHODS INVOLVED" shall not be disseminated in any

manner outside authorized channels without the permission

of the originating Department and an assessment by the

senior intelligence official in the disseminating Department

as to the potential risk to the national security and to the

intelligence sources and methods involved.

F. Restraint on Special Access Requirements. The

establishment of special rules limiting access to, distri

bution and protection of classified införmation and material

under Section 9 of the Order requires the specific prior

annental of tha head of a Depertment ou his docignes.

5. Examples of the application of the Third Agency Rule are:

(a) In a national security estimate, contributions are

received from all members of the Intelligence Community and.

then disseminated to members of the community under the

authority of the DCI;

(b) A CIA intelligence report disseminated to the State

Department may not be sent by the State Department to

the Department of Commerce without the permission of the

CIA;

(c) Information which the CIA furnishes the President's

Commission may not be disseminated to other agencies or

to the Congress without the concurrences of CIA. Thus,

a request from the Congress to the Commission for CIA

information should be referred to CIA for action so that

the necessary protection of the information can be insured.

If the Navy Department discus:

es one of its operations

with CIA, CIA may not include information about that operation

in papers it disseminates to other agencies unless it has

received the permission of the Navy Department. The distinc-

tion here is that a Navy operation would not be considered part

of the finished intelligence mechanism and therefore would

not fall within the statutory authority of CIA to disseminate

intelligence.

DATE/

At a meeting of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on

Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community 2/27/75, a

draft paper entitled, "Ambiguities and the Law," was distributed

to all members.

This paper was drafted by Mr. Marvin Smith of

CIA.

It is considered a starting point for the Intelligence

Community to identify areas in existing statutes that should be

changed, as well as to recommend new legislation deemed necessary

to clarify for

ties,

the limitations and missions of various member agencies

an or that con an on

the Congress and the American people the authori-

or departments of the Intelligence Community.

In furnishing copies of this paper to members, the

Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group, Mr. John Clarke, acknowledged the

paper presents a starting point and in no way should be considered

a final draft. He suggested that Legal Counsel representatives

of each agency or department of USIB review the document and

submit their comments directly to Mr. Marvin Smith, on Agency

code 143, extension 4055.

Following the receipt of such comments

from the

legal offices of member' agencies and departments, it

was proposed that a meeting would be called in an

effort to

begin drafting a paper representative of the Intelligence Community

which would reflect recommended changes in existing statutes or

proposals for new

legislation.

DRAFT

AMBIGUITIES AND THE LAW

CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI and, to some extent, several other."*

Federal Agencies, collect information and produce intelligence, but

of different kinds and for different purposes. This is recognized in

practice but is not as clearly established in the law. Given some

lack of clarity in the law and some uncertainty regarding limits

placed on intelligence activities, misunderstanding and fear of abuse

of power easily thrives. In reality, however, in the implementation

of mission and charters and in direction and control, there are not

as many unresolved ambiguities as the uninformed may suppose:

The experience following the National Security Act of 1947 is

such that it is now possible to eliminate some of the vagueness of

the language of the Act. The certainty and public confidence that

should result from clarifications in the law should far outweigh any

disadvantages. A number of possible amendments or additions to

current laws have already been mentioned, and proposed legislation

has already been submitted for some. These ideas and others are

suggested, below.

1) Clarity CIA's mission and charter by

amending the National Security Act of 1947 to *

reflect:

•- -

--that included in the proper functions

of the Agency are (a) collection of foreign

intelligence information; (b) conduct of

activities to carry out CIA's counter-

intelligence responsibilities overseas;

and (c) conduct of covert action operations

overseas when authorized by the President;

--that CIA's responsibility to produce

intelligence relates only to foreign

intelligence;

--that it is a duty of the Agency to develop

advanced technical equipment to improve

the collection and processing of foreign

intelligence information; and

HH 55118 DocId: 32989628 Page 250

--that the conduct of any counterintelligence

operation or other activity overseas directed

specifically at U.S. citizens (other than CIA

employees) will be undertaken in coordination

with the FBI or as requested by the FBI or by

other USG agencies in coordination with the FBI.

Establish the authority for those agencies engaged

in the collection and production of foreign intelligence to

carry on certain specified activities within the United

States, such as:

-protection of classified information and

their own installations against penetration

and compromise;

--investigation of employees, applicants,

and those persons who could assist the U.S.

foreign intelligence effort;

--investigation of employees and other

--collection of foreign intelligence

information from foreign nationals and

from cooperating U.S. citizens;

--establishment of mechanisms in support

of foreign intelligence activities; and

--cooperation with the FBI in investigations

relating to the unauthorized disclosure of

foreign intelligence.

3) Remove uncertainty regarding responsibility for

internal security matters by modifying appropriate laws to

establish clearly:

--that the collection of counterintelligence

information in the United States and the

collection of information related to internal

security are functions of the FBI;

WH 55118 DocId: 32989628 Page 252

--that the responsibility for the

--that with due regard to assessed

reliability of the information and

responsibilities for protecting sources

and methods, those agencies engaged in

foreign intelligence activities will make

available to the FBI and other Federal

agencies,

as appropriate, the security

and counterintelligence information relating

to foreign nationals in the United States and

to U.S, citizens which is derived as a by-

product of foreign intelligence activities.

4) Recognize international terrorism and international

illegal drug activities as threats to U.S. national security

and proper targets for U.S. foreign intelligence efforts,

as well as for internal security operations.

sources

and methods on a statutory basis

independent of Executive Order 11652;

--clarifying that the Director of Central

Intelligence is responsible for protecting

intelligence sources and methods related

to foreign intelligence and foreign

counterintelligence;

--assigning to the Director of the Fedezal

Bureau of Investigation the duty of protecting

intelligence sources and methods related to

internal security and to counterintelligence

within the United States;

'--imposing specific burdens, upon officers

and employees of all branches of the govern-

ment and others granted official access, not

to disclose such information without authorization,

and providing criminal sanctions for unauthorized

--establishing effective injunctive recourse,

through the Attorney General, for protection

of all intelligence sources and methods;

--providing for in camera judicial review

of material revealing intelligence sources

and methods when relevant and necessary

to criminal and civil proceedings;

--delineating authorities and responsibilities.

for investigating suspected or discovered

unauthorized disclosures by (a) U.S. citizens

overseas and (b) all persons within the

United States.

6) Delineate areas

of interagency

assistance that

facilitate performance of authorized missions, promote

• economy of resources, and as a matter of policy are

desirable, for example:

HH 55118 DocId: 32989628 Page 255

---

## Page 256

-8-

--cooperation in research and development

of technical collection and information pro-

cessing equipment, methods and techniques;

- loan or supply of equipment, methods and

techniques;

--provision of training in special skills and

techniques;

--passage of information derived as a by-

product of foreign intelligence activities to

those agencies responsible for the matters

involved.

A few changes in the procedures for reviewing intelligence

activities might add considerable understanding and confidence. Of

paramount importance is a form of congressional oversight that permits

the provision to Congress of the necessary information in a timely,

efficient and controlled manner. It is recognized that a number of

Committees in both the Senate and House must be informed of sub-

stantive intelligence, operational matters and fiscal details in varying

degrees.

Just as in the executive branch, the test of access should be

H₩ 55118 DocId: 32989628 Page 256

---

## Page 257

-9-

"need-to-know." To apply this test and to control and protect

sensitive information provided to Congress, a focal point within...

Congress would be extremely helpful. Whether a joint committee

or not,

such a focal point would also be valuable in facilitating

changes in laws affecting intelligence activities. Congress might

find that a more uniform approach to budget presentation and review

would provide better insight and understanding-

The foregoing suggestions are by no means definitive.

They

do, however, present areas that in the experience of the intelligence

community deserve careful attention.

Because of the unusual factors relating to this

entire Project, such as the sensitive nature of much of the

material involved,

urgency for handling, necessity for having

the file very readily available to the working staff at all

times, and similar

other reasons, it is essential that the

file be maintained in the work area of the Project which,

effective 4/14/75, will be in room 4063, JEH,

The purpose of

this memorandum,

therefore, is to have Files

of the file in the designated room rather than in the usual

manner

There has already been much publicity about the

Select Committees and we anticipate much more. This involves

many newspaper stories.

It is,

therefore,

believed very

desirable that a Sub A

before this Committee respond in the same commendable and expedi-

dous manner that they responded in connection with the preparation

1 - Heading in all caps, centered, brief description of

contents;

2 - White, watermarked bond paper, 8 x 10 1/2";

3 - Af least a

' 2" left margin. This is essential since

material will be inserted into a folder;

4 - Double spaced;

5 - Do not number pages;

6 - Each Division will

be responsible for the accuracy

and completeness of the information furnished in final form.

This

will also include up-dating any ipformation previous Eurnished:

Dear

Pursuant to your request, I have advised all members of the Ad Hoc

• Group of the United States Intelligence Board and Mi. Thomas K. Latimer,

Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, of Senator Church's request

to provide legal authority and organization charts of USIE entities from

their inception.

I also have alerted them to the Committee's desire for

comprehensive historical data on personnel, budgets, and cash flow for

the same periods.

They will expect to hear more directly from Senator

Church on these matters.

By early next week, we will begin providing you the CIA data in

response to the Chairman's request. The first set of annexes developed

under the auspices of the USIB Ad Hoc Group is ready and I am having

five copies of each run off for your use. Please advise if more copies

are desired.

Sincerely,

John M. Clarke

Associate Deputy to the DCI

Information Requested by Senate Select

Committee Staff Director

1. Senator Church has asked the Director to provide to the

Senate Select Committee Copies of CIA legal authorities and organi-

ziation charts to branch levels, 1947-1975. He also indicated he

wants similar auiucines au chats fus all USIG entities toi

their inceptions. In the case of CIA this will be from 1947; NSA

from 1952; DIA from 1961; etc.

The Committee is seeking a comprebensive historical

base line for each U.S. intelligence organization--its structure and

the people invalved over time.

Therefore, Senator Church has asked

that the names of all incumbents, who have held supervisory responsi

bilities over the period, down through the branch level, also be pro-

vided. The Statt Director has been made aware of the difficulties

involved in tracing personnel assignments too far back but asks that

every eifart be made io, meet the request

CIA is proceeding:

accerdiasty

Senator Church has also asked for budget and cash flow

date on all US. intelligence organizations from their inceptions.

The CiA finds that the source and uses tables, employed in anual

tinancial reports, provides the historical profile desired Supple

Church wants data which will show specific patterns of expenditures

as distinct from budgets and appropriations. A formal request

from the Chairman to all agencies on this matter can be expected.

4. The Senate Select Committee will be ready to receive

classified material this week. It is suggested that Ad Hoc Group

members begin assembling the legal, organizational, personnel,

and budgetary data for early submission. I have provided Mr.

Miller, Staff Director, with a list of Ad Hoc Principals, phone

dated 3/12/75, the Legal Counsel Division indicated that its

Legislative Matters Section would coordinate and assign

responsibilities within the Bureau for the collection and

preparation of material for tue Senate Select Committee.

This memorandum instructed Intelligence Division

to accumulate data which was identified in a memorandum from

Mr. John M. Clarke from the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group of the

Intelligence Committee. Clarkets memorandum was attached to

W. O. Cregar to W. R. Wannall memorandum dated 3/6/75.

• The identified data to be collected outlined in Clarke's memorandum

was proposed-type data that the Senate Select Committee has

- indicated an interest in.

In view of 3/19/75 letter subsequently received from

Senator Frank Church (Democrat, Idauo), Chairman of the Senate

Select Committee, to the Attorney General outlining a request for

specific FBI documents they are interested in receiving, the

Intelligence Division has begun accumulating this specific data.

In view of this request for specitic data, the Intelligence Division

will not accumulate the data outlined in the Clarke memorandum

who is presently working under Mr. Buchen in coordinating

intelligence community matters relating to the inquiries

Buchen and Hills.

In addition, the discussion covered matters in

and Bureau Source 4 (access to social security records).

Many of

these matters discussed covered topics with which Mr. Wilderotter

had become familiar when he was assigned to the Department as an

Assistant to former Deputy Attorney General Silberman.

Wilderotter said it was the feeling at The White House

I that while raw fBI files should not be made available to the

Committee, it might be necessary to permit the Committee to review

a few such

files in order that the integrity of the FBI could be

established with the Committee.

It was pointed out to him that

On 3-18-75 Professor John T. Elliff advised Inspector John B.

Hotis that he had been contacted by William Miller, Staif Director for the

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, and was asked to serve

as Director or the Committee's Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. This

is one of four Task Forces being formed by the Select Committee and it

will focus primarily on the activities of the FBI. The other Task Forces

are on Foreign Intelligence, Military and Technological Intelligence, and

Command and Control.

Elliff said he had not decided whether to accept the offer

and believed that others were also being considered for the position. He

162-

said he was reluctant to do anything that would interfere with the excellent

working amagements he had developed with the Bureau. He feels that his

initial obligation is ic the Director, and the purpose of going to the Police

Foundation was io get formal support for a project that would be of primary

benefit to the Bureau and only secondarily to the Attorney General and Congressta

He said he would be guided by our judgment in this matter and not want io

break any commitments that he might have made with the Bureau.

It he accepts the appointment Ellitt said he would, of course,

suspend work on his research project until he had terminated his employment

with the Committee. He said he would also agree not to use any classified

material that he acquired in his capacity as Task Force Director. Ellist

has discussed this matter with John Heaphy, Assistant Director of the Police

Foundation. Heaphy said the Foundation had no objections whatsoever for

his accepting the position with the Senate Select Committee, and he would

be tree to resume his projec arier the Committee work was gone suf

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo

RE: JOHN T. ELLIFF

It should be noted that the Select Committee considered

offering the position to LarryBaskir, Counsel to the President's _Clemency

Board. Mr. Baskir formerly served as Chief Counsel to Senator Ervin's

Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, and we had numerous contacts

with him in that capacity. Our purpose was to reach some common agreement

on privacy legislation that Senator Ervin planned to introduce in the 93rd

Session of Congress. There were numerous meetings with Baskir on the

same subject in the Deputy Attorney General's oftice. These eiforts proved

unsuccessful and after several months we discontinued the discussions.

In our opinion, Mr. Baskir was unwilling to work out any reasonable

compromise and seemed unsympathetic to the legiSlation concerns of law

enforcement.

It is clear that this is a matter for Professor Elliff to

determine and the Bureau should not express an official opinion. Although

we have not always agreed with his views on intelligence matters, we

have had no occasion to question his objectivity or his integrity as a scholar.

Mr. Miller knows that Professor Elliff enjoys our confidence and it is

our understanding that he offered Elliff the position in order to avoid an

adversary relationship between the Bureau and the Committee.

Professor Elliff said he would make no commitments to

the Senate Committee until he hears from us.

RECOMMENDATION:

That Professor Elliff be advised that it would be inappropriate

for us to express an opinion on whether he should accept the appointment

offered by the Senate Select Committee.

The following items of interest were discussed:

Mx. William G. Miller, Staff Director of the Senate

Select Committee (SSC),

and the Committee's Counsel, Mr. F.A.O.

Schwarz, III, visited CIA Headquarters to discuss SSC business.

Mr. Miller suggested that a tactic the SSC was considering is

the identification of several key issues that the Committee

For example, the SSC might propose

to identify two or three covert actions engaged in by CIA and

examine them in-depth rather than try to cover each and every

covert action CIA might identify. Colby advised that this

appeared to be an encouraging development and possibly each

agency of the Intelligence Community might be asked to provide

a series of key issues from which the Select Committee could

Memorandum for Mr. Wannall

RE: SENSTUDY 75

Both Miller and Schwarz accepted the Third Agency

Rule and agreed to abide by it. For the record, the SSC's

interpretation of the Third Agency Rule (which is consistent

with the Intelligence Community) is as follows: Classified

information or material originating in one department shall

not be disseminated outside any other department to which it

has been made available without the consent of the originating

department.

The Security Committee of the United States Intelli-

gence Board (USIB) will meet to develop some ground rules and

standardization for sanitizing documents to be furnished to

the Select Committees.

The question of Intelligence Community personnel being

represented by counsel was discussed. The position of the White

House on this issue has been fully reported in a memorandum from

the Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, dated 3/27/75, entitled "Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, Rodney Hills

Associate Counsel to the President."

It was also agreed at the meeting of 3/25/75 that the

President's Counsel would attempt to negotiate with the SSC to

insure that all interviews of Intelligence Community personnel

would be conducted on the premises of the bureau, agency or

department employing the persons to be interviewed.

Attached also for the record are the following:

A letter dated 3/20/75 from Staff Director William G.

Miller to Mr. John Clarke advising that Mr. Ben Marshall has been

designated as the Security Officer of the SSC;

A letter dated 3/17/75 from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke

listing employees of the SSC who have been cleared by the

Committee for certification by CIA for access to classified

information up to and including "Top Secret";

A letter from Mr. Miller to Mr. Clarke dated 3/20/75

advising that Mr. Ben Marshall was cleared for access to

classified information up to and including "Top Secret";
