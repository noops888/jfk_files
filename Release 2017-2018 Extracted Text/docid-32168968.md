something Constructive.

This G111 recently,

a few years

or less ago Made a trip to the

Soviet Union etc on the

Youth Conference Know as the World Youth Conference.

He will probably emerge from the New York thing as a

full time organiser In some special fleld suchas youth.

At the start of the Meeting Genne brought out

her brief case full of clippings (Newspaper) ete

she

also had a lot of penciled notes which she was

undoubtedly going to use to show what she was doing

and to give others hell for not co-operating with her.

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around

the late Pres. Kennedy.

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a

Communist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

against the C. party of America but by the time the

reactionarles. were getting started it was announced

that it had been disclosed that 1t seemed like the

extrene

Fight had been active. This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not the

C. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

frlend of the working class but the work of the extreme

right or almost a

fascist act. This seemed to sober

the masses that it was the same caliber of people who

had Insulted Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas,

Texas.

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this

Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he

told then he gets lots of letters of enquiry about the

C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds

of others and even sent him literature 1f he requested

16. Iney (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with a

statement but he

stated to then he would have to dig th

Istter out and be sure before he Made any statement.

Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson 1f when he got back to

New York to look in the files if he had a letter from a

wn Pokas, formerly from Bellaire, Ohio, and also an

Immate of Cambridge Asylum for a period of time, Gorby

CL 134084-557

asked Johnson to

compare the letter of pokey's with

Oswald's to see if they didn't have a lot im Common.

Palner stated that he thought the statement by the

Mathodist Minister Covered the

situation very good

when

he

stated that the fact that the Murder of Bill

Moore,M Edgar Evers and others

in the south going

by without punishment had set the stage for the

Assassination of Pres. Kennedy.

Everyone readily

agreed.

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist

Could do such a thing. There 18 not Much doubt that

since the soviet Union had expelled him by not

giving hin a Citisenship in the Soviet Union because

they thought him to be an Agent of Fascist. Genne

Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her

story told about the N.A.A.C.P. and CORE.

she finally got her Chance to unload.

She

stated that about the time of the Civil Rights

March on Washington a few days before she had been

working with COrE and NAACP the reporter from the

Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted

to talk about her.

She gave

him answers on the

phone and

finally hung up on him.

from the time

this phone conversation was completed she had been

quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a Commist

party Member, which brought about her expolsion from

the NA.A.C.P., but since

has been restored to

Membership.

Then lately a Man (Negro) by name of Johnson

head of

the local coll group was indicted for robbing a

bus driver In Steubenville,

Ohio. Geme had got 1n

touch with R. Gorby as she

thought Johnson was being

franed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting

that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed.

The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him

help but do not put CORE and the NAACP out on a limb

by doing it.

"Palmer stated that it was

News to him as

the only thing

he Knew about It Was the

articles In the paper and the

fIrst one looked as. 1f Gene had stayed on the phone

too long should have hung up quick.

He also stated that

In 1948 when he had this trouble everyone Knew

about

It and then he got more help and was successful in

defeating the reactionaries:

You have to alwys work

together on these Matters If you will be successful.

The hour was drawing Near ten d'elock P.M. and the

steuberville delegation had to work that Nite.

Iunch was furnished by each and everyone with the

exception of A Johnson and

he put away plenty.

Johnson stated that he had been down this way about one

week ago and had Contacted some of his old friends

by

phone,

so called applachian Coal project

see him at this time.

Everyone present asked A. Johnson When he was coming

back but he would not state exactly only he would notify

the Next thme he could make it.

No Literature

No Collections

During the time Gene Kuhn was belly aching about not

getting help from the Valley group It

was pointed out

by A Johnson that some years back when the wheeling group

was a part of i. Virginia group that difficulties existed

and now with the wheeling group

In with Ohio Valley the

trouble still exists.

He also pointed out that distance

has a lot to do with it too. Genne stated that Fred

Walchli was supposed to show up with the Beer.

was urged to call him against her wishes but she got

no answer on the phone"
