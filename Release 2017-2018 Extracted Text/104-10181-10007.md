rehearsing his cover story, reviewing the objectives anc

trying to anticipate questions ABAUTO-1 might ask during

their mecting together;

was given the following objectives:

a.

The foremost objective was for

to renew and

improve upon his relationship with

AJAUTO-l, to the extent that they would be able

to reminisce,

over a prolonged period, about the

relationship that existed before AJAUTO-l's departure

from the United States.

To exchange addresses and telephone

numbers for the purpose of sending occasional

greetings to one another.

C..

To invite ANAUTO-1 (and his wife, '1f

necessary) to dinner, at his expense.

d.

To ascertain AMAUTO-l's future plans.

To assess ANAUTO-1's feelings toward

the United States and toward his own government.

_to talk favorably about the

United States using himself ag an example, (the

son of immigrant parents who made good in

business) ;

to emphasize the opportunities available to anyone

with imagination, ambition and aggressiveness:

g.

If the opportunity preschted itself,

to show sympathy for the

apparent failure of

Cuban Government to reach

the 10 million ton

sugar goal and to ask whether the non-fulfillment

of

this goal would

adversely affect the economic

development

of Cuba.

It

was our hope that some-

time during the conversation AMAUTO-1 would

volunteer to discuss

his country's economic

situation which might have opened the conversation

to further exploitation by

parallel #ith objective e. above,

was instructed to ask (provided an appropriate opening

appeared in the conversation) AJAUTO-1

personal comments on the Vietnam Issue and

demonstrations in the United States and abroad:

were trying to draw out AJAUTO-l's personal analysis

of the U.S. position vis-a-vis the

war in Vietnam

and to compare his statements with the Cuban Government

position.

Although

if he had to camp
