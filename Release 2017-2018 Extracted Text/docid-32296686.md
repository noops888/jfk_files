INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

Previous investigation has reflected that the

Accion Sindical Independiente (ASI) (Independent Labor

Action) is the labor group of the Junta Cubana

Revolucionaria (JCR) (Cuban Revolutionary Board). Both

are composed of Cuban exiles in Miami and in New York

City.

The ASI is headquartered in Miami and the JCR in

New

York City.

CONRADO RODRIGUEZ SANCHEZ, a Cuban

exile, who is

a former labor leader in Cuba, now residing

in Miami, represents both of these organizations in Miami.

with

In October, 1971, MM T-l, who is well-acquainted

some

members of

the ASI in Miami, reported that

RODRIGUEZ had disclosed that his men in New York and

Washing-

ton "were accumulating plastic explosives to blow up democratic

establishments" belonging to countries that maintain relations

with the CASTRO Regime of Cuba.

Shortly thereafter agents

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Miami and

New York City interviewed RODRIGUEZ and several other indi-

viduals who were alleged to be leaders of the ASI and JCR.

They denied involvement in any such plan. Several days

later, according to MM T-1, RODRIGUEZ expressed the opinion

that

the ASI and JCR people in New York City were crazy since

they intended to continue with their bombing plans despite

the fact that the FBI had obtained information concerning

these plans.

This publication also carried

an item stating

that at an executive meeting of the JCR and ASI, Miami,

Florida, it was agreed to support the Cuban Medical

Association in Exile in its tribute to President JOSE

to work together in the underground

inside Cuba, to free political prisoners whereever they may

be, to repudiate co-existence with CASTRO Communism and

to give total support for a Government in Arms on Cuban

territory.

On March 7, 1972, MM T-1 advised that CONRADO

RODRIGUEZ indicated that members of the JCR in New York

City had been involved in an attack on a diplomatic car

In New York City during the recent past. RODRIGUEZ.

nowever, did not identily the place or the car involvec

in this

alleged

attack.

He said the name of the JCR had

not been used since members of the JR are being constantly

watched by the FBI.

RODRIGUEZ also disclosed that he is making contact

with various labor organizations in Latin America

in order

to develop a plan to attack Communists and pro-Communists

in Latin America.

He claimed to have already received the

backing of at least three labor groups.

He also disclosed

that a friend of his is talking with members of the Costa

Rican government as it is necessary to have a sanctuary

in a Latin American country in order to carry out this plan

of attack.

RODRIGUEZ

mentioned, according to MN T-1,

that he

had

received a communication from a Bolivian labor leader

who indicated that members of his organization are willing

to fight along side the Cuban exiles in their battle against

the CASTRO Regime. He indicated that acts of sabotage in

Latin America are being considered as a means of carrying out

this plan of attack.

RODRIGUEZ again stated that he has received

news from New York that his men are still determined

to carry out acts of sabotage against democratic :

establishments of countries which maintain economic or

commercial relations with the CASTRO Regime, however, he

did not furnish any specific information as

to the exact

targets, time schedule or other pertinent details.

It is to be noted that

on January 9, 1972, the

"Washington Capitol News Service" made a press release

reporting that a car belonging to the Cuban Mission to

the United Nations was scorched when a rag was placed

inside the gas tank and

set afire.

The article related

that an anonymous caller, speaking Spanish, said that

the "Commando de Cuba Rebelde" (Rebel Cuban Command) was

responsible and that "this is the beginning of what Cuban

diplomatic representatives here can expect".
