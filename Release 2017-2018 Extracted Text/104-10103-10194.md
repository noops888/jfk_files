Members of Mr. RANKIN's staff then spoke

about having found a book in OSWALD's possessions

which had certain letters cut out giving the impre-

that this might have formed the base or key

for a cipher system.

"5. Members of Mr. RANKIN's staff then com-

on the testimony of Mrs. OSWALD to the effect

that the letters from her son regarding his desire

to return to the United States had the appearance

of being dictated since they contained none of his

usual grammatical errors and used legal language

with which he would not have been familiar. . .

Mr. WILLEMS noted that Mrs. OSWALD had

introduced a statement to the effect

that she sus-

pected her son to be a CIA agent.

A considerable part of the meeting from

this point forward consisted of a review by Mr.

RANKIN and his staff of the gaps in their investi-

gation to date.

In connection with the Mexican phase of

the investigation,

members of Mr. RANKIN's staff

questioned Mr. HELMS and Mr. ROCCA regarding the

extent of the CIA file on OSWALD for the period

8 October to 22 November 1963.

The question of why no action was taken

by other agencies of the government after their

receipt of CIA information that OSWALD was in

contact with the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in

Mexico City was next discussed.

"10. The Commission, Mr. RANKIN said, would

be interested in any information held by CIA on

that had a bearing on the summarized information

be pleased to offer him and others in the Commission

the possibility of viewing the Agency's data pro-

It was indicated to him that he would

"5.

Mr. STERN volunteered oneupoint in the dis-

cussion that the Agency handling of the information

in the OSWALD case was unique among what the Commis-

sion had found had happened in every other agency.

He was critical of the Navy.

He raised specifically

the question:

why had the Navy not forwarded the

photograph of Lee Harvey OSWALD requested by the

Agency?

He added that there were six or seven other

points on which the Navy had been gigged by the Com-

mission and there would be discussion between him and

the Navy in the near future.

He stated flatly that

no Federal component except CIA had been able to show

the Commission hard documentation which indicated

there had been immediate action on field reported

information by headquarters and full instructions

Mr. STERN tended to equate this perfor-

mance to the way we handled our data and for that

reason placed great emphasis upon what the Commission

might be able to do in its report for an improved

methodology based on machines among departments and

agencies involved in security matters.

by letter to a similar question.

Mr. DULLES felt that the reply should be straight-

forward and to the point.

He thought language

which made it clear that

We should also state that neither CIA nor anyone

acting on CIA's behalf was ever in contact or

communicated with OSWALD.

I agreed with

that a carefully

phased denial of the charges

of involvement wth OSWALD seemed most appropriate.

The next question concerned the possi -

of OSWALD's having been a Soviet agent.

DULLES suggested that the Commission's question on

this matter be phrased somewhat as follows:

that our information was not in conflict with that

which

the Commission had received from State since

all of that information would remain in the records

of the Commission.

After stating my belief that there was no

real disagreement or inconsistency between the infor-

I expressed the

questions:

Do the Soviet authorities normally

permit Soviet citizens married to foreign

nationals to emigrate from the Soviet Union

to the homelands

of their spouses?

"b.

Do they normally permit such Soviet

citizens to accompany (i.e.

depart simultane-

ously with) their spouses from the Soviet

Union?

How long does it take such Soviet

citizens to get Soviet exit visas

for such a

purpose (time lapse from application to gran-

ting of visas)?

Concerning the first two questions (3a and

3b above) I pointed out that we had addressed our-

selves mainly to the question of Soviet citizens

being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while

State dealt only with the larger question of Soviets

married to foreigners being allowed to emigrate with-

out reference to whether or not they left simultane-

ously with or at another time from

their spouses.

Mr. SLAWSON commented that this explanation was most

helpful and he reread what both

we and State had said

in that light.

By way of further explanation, I said that

the statements in paragraph 6 of our memorandum of

6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being

permitted to

accompany their foreign spouses abroad

were based on

a review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans.

In only four of these cases did a Soviet wife leave

the USSR in the company of her foreign husband; in

14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone;

and in the remaining seven cases insufficient details

are known to permit us to categorize them.

I added

that although State's information began by citing

the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant

visas by the American Embassy in Moscow during

period FY 1954 tc

December 1963, it did not indicate

now many of these visas

were for Soviet citizens who

had married U.S. nationals.

Actually State provided

detailed information for only sixteen cases and dia

not indicate in many of these whether or not the

Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.

In response to a

question from Mr. SLAWSO

stated that most of the 26 cases upon which we base

our statements involved foreign students, exchange

teachers and other relatively transient

persons, and

while a number of cases have certain points in

they bear little similarity to the OSWALD case in

none involved a defector who married prior to repatri-

I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April

memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out.

Mr. SLAWSON indicated he was now satisfied on this

matter.

authorities to process visas for Soviet citizens married

Commission's report will be inclined to read

his statements through a mirror

and to assume

that the reverse of what he said was true;

i.e., that OSWALD was a KGB agent, perhaps

dispatched on a mission to kill President

Kennedy..

The inclusion of NOSENKO's informa-

tion, followed by the later revelation that he

was a soviet plant, would cast a shadow over the

reliability of the report and

the judgement of

the Commission.

Revelation that NOSENKO had any speci-

fic knowledge of OSWALD's case in the Soviet

Union would be seized upon by

an alert press

the most intriguing new item

in the whole report.

It would make NOSENKO into a public figure again

and would raise demands for

public appearances

and testimonies.

This would have catastrophic

results on our current plans to get to the bottom

of the NOSENKO affair and,

other things,

would lessen our chances of eventually learning

the true story behind his OSWALD information.

we do, we might be able in this way to contribute

significantly to the work of the commission.

SLAWSON immediately and without further

discussion said that he was convinced of the validity

of our arguments.

Mr. RANKIN was convinced that whether or not

NOSENKO's name or information were included in the re-

port, the press representatives would specifically ask

spokesmen whether or not NOSENKO, the well-

publicized KGB defector, had been asked for

his know-

ledge of the affair.

The Commission did not want t

be in the position

of having overlooked this source

nor of having withheld matters relevant to the inves -

tigation.

However, since NOSENKO appears to be a

it did not appear necessary or desirable to

there would be a public tendency to mirror-read NOSENKO's

statements after he was revealed to be a KGB plant.

At this point we all agreed that some language

could be found which would protect the Commission from

later accusations of having used planted information

or of witholding testimony.

CIA's aim was to avoid

NOSENKO's becoming a public figure or mystery or center

of attention.

We wnated if possible to slide through

Since Mr. RANKIN seemed

rather certain that the press

would ask whether NOSENKO had been consulted, even if

his name did not appear in the report, it might very

well be in CIA's interest, as well as

the Commission's,

to have NOSENKO's name mentioned in the report. (in a

manner which would discourage further questions).

RANKINwas inclined to say, at one point

something to

che effect that the Commission received informatior

from various confidential sources, without specifying

what information or which sources were involved, which

information

'did not affect the Commission's conclusions'.

We also discussed the possibility of drafting

ment to be used by Commission members should they be

questioned by the press.

It was agreed that Mr. RANKIN and Mr. SLAWSON

would work out some phraseology which would meet our

needs

and that they discuss this wording with CIA,

perhaps with Mr. HELMS present. . .

The CIA representatives thought that it would

be undesirable to

there was

general agreement on this view.

The circumstances which

contributed to this conclusion are summarized here:

however intelligent.)

The release of the fact

that NOSENKO knew specifically about the OSWAI.D

ase would, of course,

create such pressure, and

no hedging on source description could protect

his identity.

The Commission representatives, particularly

RANKIN, felt that some mention of NOSENKO might be

inevitable, at least when after the publication of its

report, the press would ask the Commission about him

and whether he had had anything to contribute.. Mr.

HELMS suggested that CIA could provide a number of

Soviet intelligence defectors to testify to the Com-

and that wording to this effect

could be worked into the Commission's draft #4, which

was otherwise quite suitable from the point of

of the Agency and the Commission.

At Mr. HELMS'

gestion,

it was agreed that CIA would undertake to

draft a few sentences to this effect.

"The Commission would appreciate receiving

American to exaggerate the lightness of a

North American's skin or jair color.

(This

is in reference to

Silvia DURAN's identifica-

tion of OSWALD as

'blond'.)

"(2) The Hotel Berlin and the Hotel

Metropole were both under the same admini-

stration and both are closely watched by the

KGB .

1(3) The 'Passport and Visa Office'

which Pimma SHIRAKOVA told Lee Harvey OSWALD

had been notified of his desire to become a

citizen of the Soviet Union, is probably

the Visa and Registration Department of the:

Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Y(4)

There have been allegations that

Syliva DURAN and her husband, Horacio DURAN

Navarro, are members of the Communist Party.

i(5) The usual Soviet procedure is to

send defectors who have carried

out their

defection in Moscow to some place in the

Sovoet Union other than Moscow reasonably

soon after it has been determined toaaccept

the defector.

(In establishing how long Lee

versing on the patio a few feet away.

One man was a tall, thin

Negro with reddish hair,

, obviously dyed. He had prominent cheek

bones, and a noticeable scar on the lower right side of his chin.

He spoke rapidly with a Cuban accent and did speak some English:

Another member ofithe. group was a white person whom ALVARADo had

seen previously in the waiting room, carrying a Canadian passport

wife of Carlos LECHUGA, Cuban Ambassador to the United

Nations, formerly Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, said that

she had received two letters from her husband in New York.

He asked for separation and said that the person in whom

source, Teresa PROENZA, Cultural Attache at the Cuban Em-

In mid-afternoon, Silvia DURAN informed the Soviet

Embassy that a male American citizen had requested

a visa

to transit Cuba on his way to the Soviet

Union. She wan-

ted to know who the American had talked with at the Soviet

Consulate. Also, she indicated that the Cuban Consulate

could

grant him the visa and arrange immigration details

if the concession of a Soviet visa were assured.

At 1605 hours (Mexico time) on Friday, 27 September

1963, Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee

of the Cuban Embassy, Consular Section, a receptionist [sic]

speaks with an unknown male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia

DURAN tells the man that the American citizen was there,

the one who wants a visa for Cuba on his way to the Soviet

Union, and he wants to know with whom he was talking there

because

she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet Em-

bassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa,

then the Cubans (Embassy) would also give him a visa without

further paper work, only advising immigration in Cuba. The

American, she says, wants to know with whom he had talked

there because he says he was told there would be no problem.

The man in the Soviet Embassy says to wait a moment. A

different Soviet speaks, and Silvia DURAN explains the same

thing to him. This man says to leave a name and telephone

number and says he will call back. Silvia DURAN gives the

telephone number 11-28-47 (Cuban Consulate). She also takes

advantage of the conversation and

stated she has moved and

wants to advise the Soviet Embassy of her change of address

so that she can receive the Soviet Embassy's bulletin. The

man says to call KOUKHARENKO to give her new address, then

27 September 1963

Pursuant to her inquiry, Silvia DURAN received a con-

firmation from the Soviet Embassy that the American had been

to the USSR installation. He had shown them a letter from

the Soviet Consulate in Washington indicating that he had

been long awaiting a visa for himself and his wife to go to

the USSR. No answer had come from Washington; however, the

waiting period was sometimes four or five months.

The. Ameri-

can also had a letter attesting that he was a member of a

pro-Cuban organization but he had claimed that the Cubans

would not give him a visa unless he had already received a

Russian visa.

Although the American was still at the Cuban Consulate,

Silvia DURAN repeated that she could not give him a transit

visa unless a Soviet visa was forthcoming, notwithstanding

the American's wish to go to Cuba to wait there for his So-

viet visa. According to DURAN, the American knew no one in

Cuba and she intended to annotate appropriately the American's

card. The Soviet official echoed her statement that the

American was not known.

American

showed papers from the Consulate in Washington,

that he wants to go to the Soviet Union and be there for

a long

time with his wife, who is Russian, but the answer

has not come from Washington in respect to this problem,

and according to this procedure it takes four to five

months, but without permission from the Soviet Union they

should ask, or better said, they cannot issue a visa there

without asking Washington. However, according to this man,

he showed a letter indicating he was a member of an organi-

zation in favor of Cuba and that the Cubans said that they

cannot issue a visa without his having a visa for the Soviet

Union, and now he (the Soviet) does not know what to do with

him (the American), because they have to wait for an answer

from Washington.

Silvia DURAN agrees the same problem exists with the

Cubans, that the problem with him (the American) is that he

does not know anyone in Cuba and therefore if that is true

it will be difficult for him to get a visa for Cuba, be-

cause he was thinking of processing his visa (for the Soviei

Union), because he knew it would require waiting a long time

for his visa to the Soviet Union while in Cuba, and from

there go to the Soviet Union. The Soviet said the thing is

that if his wife right now were in Washington she would re-

ceive her visa right now, or permission, from the Soviet

Union, to return to her country, she is going to receive her

visa in Washington but having this visa, she could communicate

to any place this permission, for example here or any place

she could receive it (visa or permission), but right now they

'do not have them. Silvia DURAN says certainly and they can-

not give a letter either because they do not know if the visa

will be approved. The Soviet says he cannot give a letter

or recommendation either because he does not know him (the

American) and asks to be excused for bothering her.

Silvia

says that's all right and many thanks.

Mrs. DURAN contacted

Embassy to ask for the address, because they had it. The

American then acceded to the Soviet official's invitation to

come by and give them the address.

Silvia DURAN was arrested at home with her husband and

members of the family who were having a party. All were

other members of the family about OSWALD's visits after she

ted her arrest to a denounciation by a cousin whom she does

not like. The Station then indicates that the source of the

Silvia DURAN had the impression that OSWALD had or be-

lieved he had made arrangements in Washington whereby in-

structions would be sent to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico to

issue a Soviet entry visa in a manner which would not require

him personally to visit the Soviet Embassy. Failure of his

real or imagined instructions to work smoothly caused him to

become rude to the Soviets. Her impression was that he was

simply a "comrade" who could not live confortably under the

rigors of capitalism and wished to return to his spiritual

home in the USSR. If OSWALD talked to anyone else in the

Cuban Embassy, she was unaware of it.

According to source, the staff meeting at the Cuban

general impression was one of shock and disbelief.

24 November 1963

LuiS ECHEVARRIA told the Chief of Station that Silvia

DURAN was completely cooperative and gave a written state-

ment attesting to two visits by OSWALD. She could not remem-

ber the exact dates but said it was the latter part of Sep-

tember. OSWALD showed her a American passport showing a

long stay in the USSR. OSWALD said he was a communist and

an admirer of CASTRO. He wanted her help to get a transit

visa to Cuba in order to go to the USSR. She said

she could

only arrange transit through Cuba if he already had a Soviet

visa. The Soviets told her that they had further checking

to do before they could issue a visa.

DURAN did not know

why he returned to the United States without a visa.

DURAN

told Gobernacion that she had

recognized OSWALD on the tele-

vision on 22 November 1963.

DURAN placed OSWALD in contact with officials of the Cuban

Mexico City Station forwards to Headquarters a trans-

Havana and Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas in Mexico City

at 0924 hours on 26 November 1963.

DORTICOS was concerned whether the Mexicans had ques-

The Ambassador responded that she had not been asked

about money.

26 November 1963

"The Cuban Government passes a note to the Mexican Am-

bassador, to Cuba, Gilberto BOSQUES, protesting the action of

the Mexican police in questioning an employee of the Cuban

Consulate in Mexico City about OSWALD's reported

application

for a Cuban transit visa during his visit.

In its note, the Cuban Government had charged that its

Consulate's employee, Senora Silvia DURAN, had been

detained

by the police on 23 November, held in prison until midnight,

physically mistreated, and subjected to insinutations about

alleged "intimate relations" with OSWALD. The Cuban note

said that this "illegal" investigation corresponded

to the

plan of reactionaries in the United States who were using

President Kennedy's assassination to promote a war policy on

the bases

of

accusations against Cuba and the Soviet Union.

Alleging

that the

Mexican police actions had disregarded the

minimum

guarantees owed to employees of a consular office,

the Cuban note concluded that the incident had damaged the

friendly relations between the

tio. countries.

passing to the Secretary of State, Mr. McCONE, and Nr. HOOVER.

In his message, the Ambassador suggested that the Mexi-

cans should rearrest and interrogate Silvia Firado de DURAN

along the following lines:

"a.

Confront Silvia DURAN again with Nicaraguan

and have Nicaraguan inform her of details of his

statement to us.

"b.

Tell Silvia DURAN that she is the only liv-

ing non-Cuban who knows the full

story and hence

she is in the same position as OSWALD was prior

to his assassination; her only chance for sur-

vival is to come clean with the whole story and

to cooperate completely with the Mexican Govern-

ment in return for Mexican Government protection.

"c.

She will not in any case be allowed to leave

Mexico."

The Ambassador asks for immediate instructions on

whether "we are authorized to request President LOPEZ

Mateos to rearrest and take Silvia DURAN into protective

custody. Danger of her disappearance or murder may be

immediate and great."

29 January 1964

DIAZ Verson, the source of Jose I. LASAGA's information

that the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico City had a long conference

with Lee OSWALD at a restaurant outside Mexico City, turns out

to be a highly unreliable source, with a reputation for fabri-

rence in Mexico of the FIOPP (Federacion Internacional de

near Chapultepec Park where they mat the Cuban Ambassador

Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas and that HERNANDEZ Armas took OSWALD

that his source for this information was Mexican journalist;

it he said that DIAZ Verson had made it all up. BORRELL

said he knew nothing beyond the fact that OSWALD had been in

Mexico, had visited the Cuban Embassy and talked to Silvia

DURAN.

A senior FBI official in Mexico, Clark ANDERSON, told

our Station Chief that he knew DIAZ Verson well wehn they

were both in Havana and that DIAZ Verson was

During a meeting with his agent handler, LIRING/3

stated that "he was

doing his best to keep active cer-

contacts he had had in the past that were on

the periphery

of the official Cuban circle. He mentioned

specifically

the case of Silvia and Horacio DURAN . . . He related that

Silvia DURAN worked as a receptionist at the Consulate in

1963-1964 and was on duty when Lee Harvey OSWALD applied

for a visa. She had been recommended to the Cubans by Teresa

PROENZA, the Press Attache from 1959 until 1962. LIRING/3

described Teresa PROENZA as a Cuban woman aged about 52, a

Lesbian, and a member of the Communist Party of Cuba, who

was currently in jail in Cuba as the result of a conviction

for espionage on behalf of CIA. LIRING/3 recalled that dur-

ing his last visit to Havana, a friend of his in the Minis-

try of Education, informed him of Teresa PROENZA's present

situation and advised LIRING/3, in the event he was asked,

he deny that he had known Teresa PROENZA of had had anything

to do with her. LIRING/3 continued that just the other day

Silvia DURAN had telephoned him to say hello and that he had

visited her at her home to renew his acquaintance.

The latter replies that

LIRING/3 continued that Silvia DURAN informed him

that

she had first met OSWALD when he applied for a visa

and had

gone out with him several times since she liked him from the

start. She admitted that she had sexual relations with him

but insisted that she had

no idea of his plans. When the

news of the assassination broke she stated that she was im

mediately taken into custody by the Mexican police and in-

terrogated thoroughly and beaten until she admitted that she

had had an affair with OSWALD. She added that ever since

then

she has cut off all contact with the Cubans, particu-

larly, since her husband Horacio who was badly shaken by the

whole affair, went into a rage and has forbidden her to see

them.

She added that she felt certain that her telephone

was tapped by the Mexican police, or, more probably by CIA,

since tapping was an expensive proposition and the Mexicans

wouldn't be able to afford it for so long a period.

ROWTON (P), LIRING/3's agent handler, counseled LIRING/3

against further

contact with the DURAN's on the ground that it

might put him under some sort of

suspicion whether in the eyes

of the Mexican police or the Cubans.

Entry in "Historic Diary".

[DDP 4- 0864]

"1.

• In a document entitled 'Historic Diary' there appears an entry

which refers to 'an elderly American'.

entry is under the date 26

October 1959 when OSWALD was allegedly confined in

an unidentified Moscow

hospital.

It is apparent that every effort should be made to iden-

tify the

elderly American, if he existed.

We assume the lead is

still outstanding.

It is

our recommendation

that the Department of State

urgently request through its channels a careful search of Embassy and Con-

sular records in Moscow which might reveal the identity of an elderly

American hospitalized at the end of October 1959 and possibly registered

with the Embassy as a tourist.

An independent confirmation of this de-

tail could be of freat significance in validating the entries of OSWALD's

'Historic Diary' and would possibly lead to the development of additional

information on OSWALD's stay in the USSR."

His replacement did arrive in September.

AZCUE was schedu-

We do not know who might have told OSwAlD that AZCUE or any other

Cuban had heen

or some Soviet

official might have mentioned it if OSWALD complained about

AZCUE's altercation with him."

"1.

The Soviet documents

forwarded to this Agency under your letter of 20

additional detail on OSWALD.

The information in

loes not contradict our previous information.

The documents do clarify

somewhat OSWALD's alleged

occupation at the Minsk radio plant: giving the

original Russian terms used in decsribing his. job.

"2. The following points relating to the documents are worth noting:

"a. A significant omission from the materials: provided is the letter

OSWALD allegedly wrote

to the Supreme Soviet requesting Soviet citi-

zership.

"B.

OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for

and a second receint in 1962 for his Identity

The similarity of wording of the receipts

regarding his understanding of Soviet residence and

travel regula-

tions further supports our belief that such regulations are identical

or nearly identical for bearers of either type of identity document.

This means that OSWALD should have obtained permission in July 1961

to travel to Moscow, but, as we know from other cases, failure to ob-

tain travel permission is not uncommon and not a seriousi offense.

The includsion of Marina's exit visa

'application' is singular

in view

of the fact that the Commission had not requested information

on Marina.

The Soviet translators for OSWALD's early

documents.

2 July 1964

Memorandum for Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel etc.

Subject: Lee Harvey OSWALD.

[DDP 4-3401]

The following remarks have been recently attributed to Soviet Consul

Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV in Mexico City regarding the subject.

'I met OSWALD here. He stormed into my office and

wanted me to introduce and recommend him to the Cubans.

He told me that he had lived in the USSR. I told him that

I would have to check before I could recommend him. He

was nervous and his hands trembled, and he stormed out

of my office.

I don't believe that a person as nervous as

OSWALD,

whose hands trembled could have accurately

fired a"rifle.'

Our Mexican Station has checked its records for the period OSWALD

was in Mexico City and has advised it is quite possible that OSWALD:

though he had talked with Valeriy KOSTIKOV when he actually had spoken

to YATSKOV; or that he first spoke to KOSTIKOV who turned him over to his

superior YATSKOV.

Statements Reportedly Made by George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT

Concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the Assassination of President Kennedy

[DDP 4-3479]

"1.

The information furnished below has been received from usually reli-

able sources

consists of statements reportedly made by the de MOHREN-

SCHILDTS

concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the assassination of President

Kennedv.

Shortly after the assassination of President

Kennedy, George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT were

among the guests attending a cocktail party in Haiti.

...

The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were asked if there was

any

substance to the view expressed in certain foreign:

periodicals such as L'Express, a left-wing Parisian

veekly newspaper, that the Kennedy assassination was

a plot organized

by Dallas millionaires.

George de

MOHRENSCHILDT said that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very

likely that certain

reactionary elements in Dallas had

organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis:

turbed person such as OSWALD to

achieve their ends.

Mrs: de MOHRENSCHILDT agreed fully with this thesis.

Your Memorandum dated

28 July 1964.

A review of the results of monitoring Soviet foreign broadcasts at

the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD had apparently been

taped was conducted with negative results.

Therefore, it is assumed

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facili-

ty for internal consumption.

"2. With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked if any

attempt had heen made hy the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for propaganda

purnoses, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts, or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in Minsk.

"1. The files of this Agency contain no identifiable traces on Konstantin

Petrovich SERGIEVSKY or on his sister.

"2. We have no information which would either confirm or refute allega-

tions that Lee Harvey OSWALD made one or more visits to the city of Gorky

in April and May 1960 or at any other time.

"3. The term 'mokrym delam' which appears in the notes which SERGIEVSKY

brought with him to the British Embassy may be translated 'wet affairs' or

'liquid affairs'.

It is an expression or jargon us d by the KGB to refer

to activities involving kidnapping or assassination.

Subject: Joachim JOESTEN

[DDP 4-5110]

Attached are reproduced copies of a set of German documents seized by

the U.S. authorities

at the end

of World War II.

The documents concern

Joachim JOESTEN, author of Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy?, Marzani & Mun®

sell Publishers,

The captured documents in this set range in

dates from July

1936

to November 1937 and contain the statement that

JOESTEN had been a member of the Communist Party of Germany since 1932.

You will note that the attention of the German

security organs was direc-

ted

at JOESTEN as early as 1936.

At that time the Communist Party had been

been outlawed in Germany and the German authorities apparently had begun

collecting

information

about JOESTEN and his activities.

tion seems to have culminated in the proposal for revocation of his Ger-
