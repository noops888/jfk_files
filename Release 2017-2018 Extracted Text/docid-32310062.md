OLACOSA NOSTRA

AR-CONSPIRACY

On 10/25/68, NY 6436-C-TE

(member source) advised

that about 10 years ago CARLO GAMBINO had a group in Baltimore

numbering about 50.

FRANK CORBI is the Capodecina having

taken over for LOUIDICIENA (LUIGI MORICI). Because of limited

contact the informant is unable to name these persons.

The number

50 seems to be excessively high and it is unlikely that the cI.

will ever be able to name a large fraction of this number.

However, in an attempt to reconcile this group, Baltimore

requested to forward to the NYO the names, photographs and a very

brief statement of current activities of

named members, suspected

members and all known BAO LCN associates who possibly could

be members of LON.

In the near future informant may visit Baltimore and

if so he will then be in a position toidentify additional

members.

FRANK CORBI's son was married in 1966 in Baltimore.

Any photographs of hoodlums attending this affair, other

weddings, wakes, funerals and social functions should be sent

to the NYO.

These will-be show to the informant for possible

identification.

Since informant has advised that CORBI's brother

(probably referring to PASQUALE CORBI)was a LCN member

photographs of all his brothers should likewise be sent.
