SYNOPSIS

On 4 September 1963, information was received from a source that had administered

a polygraph examination to an individual who claimed he was an Anti-Castro Cuban

and that he was to take part in an

invasion of Cuba on 12 September 1963, the pur-

oose of which was to counteract a "oseudo" Anti-Castro invasion which was actuallv

led by three Cuban Communists and is scheduled to commence on 18 September 1963.

The results of the polygraph examination were reviewed and, although the test

could have been more detailed and accurate, the opinion is

that the sublect of

the examination was being truthtul in relating his intentions as to his activities

in the invasion of 12 September 1963.

The following information was developed,

and was relayed to the Los Angeles, Califomia, office of the Central Intelligence

Agency on 4 September 1963.

1. Predication

This investigation was authorized by LCDR f. J. LESSING, USCo, Chief, Intelligence

MCT 11205-78016-

2. On 4 September 1963, the undersigned investigator became engaged in a conversa-

tion with Mr. Robeft BARRICK, Directors and Mr. Bert BOVAY, Polygraph Examiner,

of the West Coast Lie Detection Center, 842 Redondo Avenue, Long Beach, California.

BARRICK and BOVAY related the following:

On 30 August 1963, BARRICK administered

a polygraph examination to Loran Eugene HALL who is presently using the alias of

Lorenzo PASCILLO.

The polygraph examination was requested by one Bitt TEUNNISON

who identitled himself as a member of the John Birch Society. TENNISON requested

the examination be given to HALl to verify the facts that HALL had told IEUNNISON

regarding his (HALL's) activities in an invasion of Cuban planned for 12 September

1963.

HALL was scheduled to give a talk before a local chapter of the John Birch

Society. The purpose of this talk was to raise funds for an invasion group in which

HALL is to take part. During the course of theresametiRbethe following was

developeds HALL stated that he took part in the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cubas

HALL is presently on a fund-raising campaign in the United States to raise money.

for an invasion which is allegedly scheduled to take part in fuba on 12 September P

1963.

HALI stated that the purpose of this invasion of Cuba is to counteract a

"pseudo" invasion of Cuba which is seduled to take place on 18. September 1963.

The invasion of 18 September 1963 is slated to be headed by three groups, one of

which is to depart from Guatemala, one from Nicaragua, and the third groups

point of departure is unknown.

HALL related that each of the three groups is led

by a known Cuban Communist.

HALl stated the CIA is aware of the invasion of 18

September but has been led to believe that these three group leader: are former

Cuban Communists who are now. "anti-Castro". Actually, Hall' stated, these group

leaders are still active Communists.

The invasion of 18 September 1963, has been

designed to oust Castro from Cuba but still retain a Communist regime thereby

allowing the present U. S. administration to play down the Cuban issue for politi-

cal purposes. HALL stated the new regime in Cuba will give the appearance of

over-throwing CASTRO and the establishment of a democratic govemment but in effect

will still be a Communist stronghold and Soviet controlled.

HALI alleges that

the present administration is fully aware of the outcome of the invasion planned

for 18 September 1963.

HALL stated that the administration is

; "for" that invasion

so that the Cuban situation will not be an issue in the forthcoming election. : HALL.

stated that the next election for president will probably be between KENNEDY and

GOLDWATER and that GOLDWATER is presently "riding high" politically on the Cuban

situation.

HALL stated the purpose of his invasion scheduled for 12 September 1963.

is to destroy refineries, powerplants, etc. and to fight against the forces

invading on 18 September.

HALL stated he also plans to take motion pictures of

the action and return to the United States for further fundraising speeches.

The polygraph examiner, BARRICK, stated that HALL agreed not to accept money from

the John Birch Society until his retum to the U. S. after the in: sion.

BARRICK

related that HALL appears to be Cuban in that he is dark ana wears a beard bui

has no Cuban accent.

BARRICK further related that HALl is apparently vehemently

anti-Semitic in that HALl claims that of the one hundred forty top advisers in

the present administration, one hundred four of them are "atheistic Jews". Each "

time the subject of Jews came up in their conversation, BARRICK related, HALL

nearly "went through the roof" berating them.

BARRICK stated that the individual

requesting the polygraph examination, IEUNNISON, appears to be well-read on

Communism and "seemed to know what he was talking about"• JENNISON alleges that

the man directly under J. EDGAR HOOVER in the structure of the FBI is slated to

take HOOVER's job in the event of his death or retirement. Thir inaividual, whose

name BARRICK could not recall, supposedly was deported fron this country for

his activities in the Communist Party many years ago and return in the early 1950's

to take his present job. TENNISON stated that the planned invasion of 18 September

is just a part of the "international conspiracy" designed to take over this and

other democratic countries.

3. HALL was given a polygraph examination as to his intentions regarding his

activities in the planned invasion of 12 September 1963.

The results of the

examination were reviewed by the undersigned.
