nished by SDECE, suprats)

The notebook, not identical to that furnished by

SDECE also contained

numerous notes and names and addresses,

Much of that which was legible appeared to be rough draft

notes,

the significance of which could not be determined;

some of the notes apparently were intended for speech

making purposes.

tinues to espouse the China line and apparently does not

limit her speeches to pro-Chinese Communist groups.

She

is also active in the affairs of leftist organizations.

Based upon information received from SDECE, one

of the purposes of subject's trip apparently was to contact

pro-Chinese Communist organizations or sympathizers while

abroad, indicating her interest in the pro-Chinese Communist

1st Enterest

movement is not limited to the US, but is international in

charaeter.

She has indicated a willingness to traye

to Chicago to

nake a speech for the Ad Hoc Committee and it is antici-

pated she will be requested to do so in February, 1969.

It is hoped a sufficient relationship will beddeveloped

as a result of the contacts to enable sources to obtain

information re subject's activities.

Communists as mentioned in tre NY let.

above will be dependent upon the results obtained. ()

Should subject becone more active in the SDS it

is felt informants active in the organization could be:

targeted against her.

If subject accepts the offer to teach at the

proposed school to be established by WODETZKI, attempts

will be made to develop informants in classes taught by

subject..r

NYO is conducting investigation concerning some

of the individuals mentioned in subject's notebooks and

will remain alert for the identity of anyone who could be

developed as an

informant.

Concerning subject and her husbands proposed trip

to Mexico, Legat Mexico has been requested to alert authori-

ties re their arrival and request coverage of their activi-

ties.

All significant information has been furnished

to the Bureau and non-significant information recorded in

memorandum form for the NYO.
