coupled with a comicient to, basic social reform and opposition to

Corrunism, and

presented within an idcological framework stressing

the dignity of the human person,

I - CURRENT ENLANCE SULET DE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRACY

Parties of Current Significance. Christian Democratic

parties are sereially agreed to be of current political significance

In only four Latin American countries - Chile, Venezuela, El

Salvador and Peru.

The: Chilean PDC is the only party with the respon

sibility of soverning; the solid victory of Prel in the 1964

presidential clection was followed by an even more impressive:

showing in the March 1965 congressional election. However, the

Party's refors program is being Implerented with less than

deliberate speed, no progress has been made in weakening

of the cicctorate in 1963) and the governing Accion Democratica

COPÉI Secretary General Rafael Caldera,

onc of the few Latin American CD leaders of Intemational

stature, is expected to be the Party'e standard beazer in his

fourth try for the presidency.

c.

In El Salvador, the PDC garnered 29 percent of the

votes in the March 1966 legislative election and one of ita

Icaders, Jose Napolcon Duarte, retained the mayoralty of San

Salvador.

In less than six years the PDC has become the

leading opposition party. It has little chance of capturing

the presidency in 1967, but should be a strong contender by

1972, with Notre Dame-educated Mayor Duarte the lixely

candidate.

The Peruvian PDC formed a coalition with the Popular

Actica (AP) Party in 1963; 1t currently holds two cabinet

positions.

Sore would argue that the Peruvian CD (with only

4 percent of the votes in 1963) has no real future in compe

tition with the doninant AP and the long-established AYRA,

both reforist parties, and thus should not be Included in a

listing of significant CD parties.

Some weight is added to

this argument by the very recent split off of a dissident

faction of the PDO into a separate party. However, the

inclusion of the Peruvian party here is based primarily on the

fact that it is the only CD group participating la a coalition

governent and chus contributes an element of stability to the

political scene in Pert.

Brazil and Guateuila - that night develop as moderately leportant

forces ove: the next five years.

The Dominican PRSC stands as a prime example of

co Irresponsibility from the cinc Caonabo Javler. took over

Pasty leadership in Che wake of the Dominican Revolution in

April 1965. It has collaborated with the entire spectrum of

Massist-lining parties, and roderation of its extreme

cilitancy in the near future appears unllkely.

The PRSC has

developed a small but talented cadre of leadership, primarily

from the univorsity ranks, and is buttressed by the strongeat

CLASC affiliäte (CASC) in the Hesisphere:

The Panamanion PDC was registered some five years

ago sed polled only 3.1 percent of the votos in 1964.

Although

I continues & niniscule party, It has mado significant

organicational strides and its philosophy of social justice

gives It roots lacking by most Panamanian parties, which are

darscly personalistic or cied to tinancial Interests. "1t the

Parora CD succeeds in expanding Its middle-class base and

attracts militants fros the predominantly negro and mestizo

population, It could becone a force of some importance.

While the Brazilian PDC polled a mere 4 percent of

the vote in 1964, the Party has significant strength in three

Piuy states of the Center-South (Parana, Sao Paulo, and

Cuanabera).

Like all other pre-Castçllo Branco political

parties, the PDC was unable to campaign under its own banner

In the presidential and parlimentary elections of late 1966.

Expanded political activity will probably be permitted after

the seating of. President Costa e Silva in March 1961, but t

II. " PARTY YOUTH WINGS

Co Strenith in Unlversitics Ahead of Party Strength: of

with all political groups in Latin ircrica, the vast majority of

CD party militants are drawn fron the ranks of etudent appendages

In the local univeralties. In most countries of the hemi-

sphere, Co voting strongch on the caspus is much

a more significant

than the political strength of the parent party.

A few cxamples

illustrate this point:.

In Panana, the Party polled 3.1 percent

of the vote in 1964 (and probably rould poll not more than s

perscat todor), while Its University youch got-12.8 percent in the

January 1966

clection. The Dominican PRiSC received S.4 percent of

the vote In 1962 (and its prescht strength could will be lower

because of Intemal divisions and leadership conflicts), but ite

May 1956%

In Venezuela, COPEl polled 22 percent of the vote in

1953; lis student wing on the campus of the Central University,

horover, polled 40.? percent of the vote in 1966.

These comparitive

figures

suggest some conclusions which are presented in Paras. 19

and 20 below.

Redicallantion of Youth Win?s. Several CD leaders, most

notably Frei and Caldera, have expressed considerable concern over

the groiring radicalization of party youth wings.

That youth groupe

of every political stripo assume positions to the left of their

partics is nothing new, but the situation in several CD groups has

gotten badly out of hand.

In several countries only an opaque line

divides the positions assuned by CD youth groups (or important wings)

fros the stance assured by Marxist youth elements. "In Venezuela,

the wing of the COPEI youth headed by Marta Sosa 10 g0 "far-out"

Frei reportedly told a German Christian Democrat that his youth

wing is in danger of beconing Marxist.

In Panama, the doninant

wing of tho CD youth has assumed positions at least as Indical as

group in the National University is allied with the Coumunist

Grouch Potential Exters, But Luch Less Than Originally

Anticipateil.

The CD novcront has made only modest progress the

past two yoars.. Indications are chat the developzent of the

movescnt will be nuch alover and less extensive than many anti-

cipated in the first flush of enthusiase following the frei

victory, for it has many problcas to resolve.

Chief anong those.

perhaps, is CD failure to rcach the lover social classes and to

devolop a significant worker base.

The chances of CLISC contr/-

buting positively to correct this

failure appear renote. Another

major problem is the absenco of an Idcological comonground,

despite the lip service paid to the Papal Encyclicals and the

Catholic social philosophers, and the failure to enunciate ointm

behavioral standards that these philosophical roots would impose.

This deficiency 1s the root cause of two manifestations: First,

• propensity to consort with Co-unist and assorted Marxist groups

(c.g•, in Colombia, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic and Panama).

Second, the progressive radicalization of party youth wings which

thrcatens to push the parent parties further left.

The fact,

renains, nevertheless, that Christian Denocracy Is the most unifled

non-Communist novement in Latin America.

It cannot be labeled

deriocratic or anti-Concuriot because of the behavioral aberrations

of several national parties.

Need for Eclectic Operational Approach to CD's. The

ranks of those wio vicried Christian Denocratic prospects with

great cathusiasm. tvo ycars ago - including the Europcan financial

backers of tho novcacht . have drindled considerably. But those

who have been critics of Christian Democracy from the outset (many

of whom night be described as the "visceral denigrators") have

displayed no more perception in evaluating CD prospects. The

head-in-the-sand gencralization that Christian Democracy has no

future does not stand the challege of investigation.

Neither does

the assertion that Christian Democracy 1s the hemispheric wave of

the future.

The only valid generalization that might be made on

CD prospects is that all gencralizations are false.

• We would

subait that the only valid approach to the CD phenomenon is to assesa

the movemeat and make operational judgenents on a country-by-

country basis.

There are some countries where the collapse of

the party would be no losg.

The key question 1s: Can the party

develop as a positive element in national political stability?

If so, it is Incumbent on the Station to develop assets within

the party and to examine the need for operational involvement.

Station posture toward the CD nosenent must be based on the raw

scalities of the local situation, case by case.

The PRSC hopes

that this moderate: line will in-

has not. evolved beyond a

sort of fraternity held together

more by negative factors such as

hostility to the'US, to capital-

ism, and to the oligarchies, than

by any basic agreement among it's

members on doctrine or principles.

Moreover,

the individual parties

have

made very clear that they

will fight any effort--whether

initiated by ODCA or by the Eu-

ropean financial backers

of the

CD movement--to impose standards

and controls that will impinge

on their freedom of action.

results from the lack of funds.

The sun centioned is $10,000.5

No change in United States policy regarding action

A base of

Scurce Comment®

At the tire of his departure, Batista told

the

executive

committee that

he was going directly to Caracas,

Venezuela.

It was not until after his return that it was

learned

that he had not gone to Caracas or to Guatemala as

he had planned. He later explained that while he was in

Puerto Rico he telephoned his relative in Guatemala and was

infored that the latter had "failed in his efforts."

Field Comment.

Presumably he was referring to an interview

with President Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro which Batista

had earlier said had been arranged by his

cousin. (Cf.

: 125X0-7778-8- y0er

3.. Headquarters Comment: In early August 1964, Folch was reported to

have been in charre of Dominican sinxiet Armed Forces aid in a

xe caching operation for Cuban exiles in the Monte Cristi area.

í. The location of the house was not given.

Source Comment.

The document, as originally drafted, was

modified because Barbeite felt that the tone was too

strong.

Also, the amount of money requested was reduced to $10,000.

Field Comment. An earlier report from the same source

reported that

the document was being prepared,.

$75,000 would be requested. (Cf UrG-8322) 3-20-3/inall

FIci a demostrado ser un mentiroso. Frei la demostrado ser un po

litigiero vulgar que para justificar su sanguinario gesto, trata

de culpar a la Tri-Continental. Frei se desermascara. Frei demues-

cro di pueblo de Chile y al mundo qué tipo de revolución es la

que va i hacer. qué tipo de gobierno es el que va a llevar adelan-

te. Es decii.

no una revolución sin sangre, sinó una política de

sangre sin revolución; sangre sin revolución, esa es la política

de Froi, sangro sin revolución.

ese es el gobierno de Frei, sangre

sin rovolución, esa es la política de la Alianza para, el Progreso".

Después de estas expresiones, no podemos menos que salirlo

al paso a Castro. Y a la camarilla que desgobierna hoy a Cuba, e

Instar y pedir mayor colaboración con los patriotas que hoy ofren-

can sus vidas por liberar a Cuba, a fir de evitar no solo la con-

tinuada masacre de cubanos que se lleva a cabo en la Isla, sino

tambion ponerle fin a todos estos

incidentes bochornosos para la

historia, en los que aparece un cubano, ofendiéndo públicamente

ante el mundo. a un Presidente, a un Partido y a un pueblo que a

contrario sensus de lo que el

esta haciendo en Cuba, sí está rea-

todo momen

to el sano nacionalismo, sí se ha puesto de frente cuantas veces

las circunstancias lo han requerido a los oligarcas y explotado-

res.

Para terminar, sólo me queda reiterarle, que en nombre de

la solidaridad que une a todos los demócratacristianos, exprese

públicamente, su deseo de colaborar con la lucha que mantiene el

pueblo cubano por derrocar al castrocomunismo y poder realizar en

Cuba, una verdadera revolución en libertad, asf como

su respaldo

a la actitud asumida por el Gobierno,

el Partido Demócrata Cris-

tiano y el pueblo chilero en los actuales momentos.

Pendiente de su atención y respuesta y dejando constancia

de mi mayor consideración, quedo suyo

cordialmente,

Ernesto Rodriguez

Sec. de Relaciones/ Internacionales del

MDC de Cuba

JUVERTOS DEMOCRATA-CRISTIANA DE CUBA.

BLAND, FLA. U.S.A.

Miami, Marzo 17 de 1966

Estimado compañero:

La JDC de Cuba,

fiel al pensamiento de nuestro Apostol

José laití que dice:"ver en silencio un crimen es cometerlo", no

ha quirião marginarse del daño que Castro quiere hacerle a la

Revolición en Libertad, que está realizando el Presidente Eduar-

co Frei, su Gobierno y el Partido Demócrata Cristiano de Chile.

Consciente de que es posible que no

te hayan llegado

muchas

de las informaciones

relacionadas con los innobles ata

ques bíblicos de Castro a Frei y su Gobierno, calificándo al Pre

sidente de "representante de la burguesía chilena"

• "reaccionario"

"mimaio del imperialismo yanqui ! guardián de sus intereses en

Chile'.....etc. Hemos querido comunicarte, no sólo los ataques de

Castro a Frei, sino una de las muchas respuestas que se le han

¿ado = castro. Nos referimos a la que en dias pasados hiciera el

Diputado Demócrata-Cristiano Chileno, Alfredo Lorca y que a con-

tinuacil. cranscribimos

"Realmente, Fidel' Castro es un caso dig-

no de análisis. Hace pocos dias atrás, según expresaron diputa-

sos que estuvieron en Cuba, Castro dijo que Frei era un gran Pre-

sidenta, agrogó que si el hubiera

estado en Chile, habila hecho

lo miso que Frei.

Pero ahora, porque

se le ha tocado la epidermis de la

II1-Concánental, Frei se transforma en un Castro Cualquiera.

I'o estuve en cuba -añadió Lorca- en 1959 cuando Castro

subió al poder. En esa ocasión le pregunté al ver a tantos hom

bres armados, si pensaba reorganizar al ejército. Y él me contes-

tó, con ese modo tan tropical, "shico, armas para qué cuando se.

tiene ai pueblo"

Si. embargo, -añadió. Lorca- en los siete años que Fidel

=1 pueblo detrás de él, arda nas armado que un milicar en

guerra. En Chile, todos los Presidentes que yo recuerdo. los

casa del mañana. ..

racicaics,

el Sr. Ibáñez. el St. Alessandri, el propio Sr. Froi.

Han recorrido todo el pais sin gendarme, ni pistoleros a suoldo

como dic

que utiliaa Castro.

so se puede docir que Frei sea un cobarde. un mentiroso

y un despota como Fidel Castro afirma - añadió Lorca-. En cambio

El csi, aciguardado por metralletas y no puede dormir, ni so lo

conoce comicilio ¡ijo porque los hijos de los muertos en el pare

dón ie juscan: Ademis -puntualizó Lorca- valo la pona destacur que

rádie se ha ido de Chile. En cambio, es público y notorio que más

de 300 000 personas han huido del paraiso fidelista. Y me atrevo

a pera:" que si Fisel Castro diera libertad a quienes quieren ir-

se de Ciba, se quedaría solo con sus barbas y su hermano Raúl,

porciue camilo Cienjuegos ya no está. Dicon que se cayó de un avión.

Finalmense, Lorca recordó el caso del que fuera Presiden

te de ice tribunales populares de Cuba, Sorf Marin."Es un hombre

•Iritegió, puro y extremadamerte justo", decía Castro de él. "Estoy

segure tie núnca condenaría a guien no mercciera la pona 'de mucr-

te". si, obstante una mañana amaneció de mal genio y el Sr. Sori

Marís se convirtió en un agente de la Central de Inteligencia de

los Estados Unidos. Resultado: hizo fusilar a ese hombre puro.

Integro y justo.".

Estas palabras, expuestas por el Diputado D.C. Alfredo

Lorca, señalando algunas de las

muchas contradicciones de Castro:

ratificas una vez más lo que la JDC de Cuba a través de sus di-

rigertua, le ha venido diciendo a toda la juventud demócratacris

trana se Frérica y que hoy, con más fuerza y moral que núnca nos

permite pedirte en nombre de la solidaridad que nos unc, que ex-

porgas pisticamente

tu respaldo a la Revolución en Libertad que

viene ¿calizando el Pueblo, Gobierno y Partido Demócrata Cristia

no de Calle así como tu colaboración a la lucha que mantiene el

por derrocar al castrocomunismo existente en nues

tra Patria.

Consciente de que nuestra solicitud será escuchada por

tÍ. Y seguros de que nos darás a conocer la atención que has de

presta-le, quedo a tu entera disposición
