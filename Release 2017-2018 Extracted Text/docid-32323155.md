understood MOLINA had hired attorney MULLINAX but did not know

what MOLINA was going to do.

OROZCO, at a recent District meeting of the forum, had

reported MOLINA's plight.

Among those present were Attorneys

CALDERON and ED IDAR.

Dr. HECTOR GARCIA, Forum founder, was

present also. They were willing to come to Dallas and talk and

help MOLINA.

OROZCO was sure

(CALDERON, IDAR and GARCIA) that they should talk to MOLINA and

BILL LOWERY together:

latter's work was with the FBI. This suggestion was made after

OROZCO told them that if he or any other member of the forum,

simply for being & Forum member, was to be persecuted now or

later, they could have the Forum. OROZOO told LANDIN that he was

reluctant on taking such steps since he had not consulted MOLINA

about it.

In fact,

there has been no contact between the Forum

and MOLINA. ALBERT OROZCO felt that he had done the right thing..

MOLINA, he recalled, had worked there for a long time, why was he, he.

wondered, singled out.

LANDIN agreed that he had done the right

thing•

Informant had no additional information.
