In light of the information presented above, it is not believed tbat

Subject is eligible for staff employment or contract Type A employment.

It is conceivable, however, that Subject could be utilized as an inde

pendent contractor with access to information classified through SECRET,

provided his future usefulness to WH Division would not ba nullified by

an overt association with this Agency. It is reconmended that WH Division

be so advised.
