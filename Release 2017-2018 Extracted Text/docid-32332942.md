has observed "young Johnnie" LA ROCCA at the establishment

and noted that he was visiting Pittsburgh from his

Johnstown, Pa., residence during the week of February 19,

1961.

She added that he frequented a few of his old haunts

and

was evidently "business-minded" during this visit.

PG T-3 advised that officers of the North Star Cement Block

Company are extremely upset about the recent prison sentences

imposed and adverse publicity directed against highly-placed

officials of the General Electric Company and the Westinghouse

Electric Corporation for price-fixing and antitrust violations.

He stated that the North Star Cement Block Company is ostensibly

a member of "an association," not otherwise described, but

believed to be an organization of Pittsburgh or Western

Pennsylvania cement block manufacturers.

The aforementioned informant stated that members are engaged

in a conspiracy which may include price-fixing and that North

Star officials, JOHN CONTI and ROY VEY, are so jumpy lest

they become involved that they are making up a story to the

effect that an anonymous caller told CONTI that a representative

of the Justice Department had been making inquiries about the

association and the membership of North Star in it. He said

North Star's representative to the association may be the

vice-president of this association and that the story that

CONTI

made up and will tell may cause North Star to pudhne

out of the association before some members tell investigators

all

they know.

He added that CONTI and VEY, along with the

PRUNER brothers, ALDO and ALMO, who are also executives of

the North Star Cement Block Company are extremely worried about

being called before a Federal Grand Jury looking into the

activities of both the association and/or SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA.
