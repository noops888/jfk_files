The experience

as been both trustrating and challenging

epitomizing the

issues in transition from'a totally classified past to a nev

intelligence environment

yet to be defined.

The tension in

law between protoction of sources and methods and more open

government was apparent, daily, to those involved; good case

made as we sought to adhere to both principles and

to regain, through this process, some credibility for the

Agency.

I've tried in the past to convey my appreciation

Promotion Recommendation - Frederick C. Randall to GS-15

This memorandum constitutes a formal recommendation that Fred

Randall, GS-14/8, now Chief of the DDO Privacy Information (DDO/PIC)

unit in Services Staff, be promoted to GS-15. The position calls for

that grade.

Mr. Randall is. 49 years of age; entered on duty in CIA in

September 1951 as a GS-7. assigned to OS0/FDZ..

He is married; 'has four

children, served briefly in the Air Force (1945-46); has an AB in

Government, an AM in Forcign Affairs, and was a PhD candidate in

International Relations.

His Agency service was in FE froin 195.3 to

1965, including overseas tours in

from 1965 to March 1975, including 2 years in the DC field office;

his current assignment dates from 16 March

75. His date of grade is

The specifics of Mr. Randall's current assignment and all the

superlatives about it I have lust recounted in a fitness report which

I propared today, as well as in a QSt recommendation (approved) of

October 1975 and an out-of-cycle promotion recormendation dated

8 August 1975:

I rate his performance Outstanding and refer the

reader(s) to the reports cited for details.

•I would note here that

Mr. Randall changed his home base and functional category in Vovember

of 1975 and was rated rumber 1 of 4 Category C nominees fron this Staff

by all four members of the SS Panel, • I would note further that when

I submitted my August 75 out-of-cycle promotion recommendation, Mr.

Randall's career designation vas B/OG; given his personal circunstances

the DDO suggested that Randall change his career designation to become

more competitive "and have an excellent chance on the next go round."

The QS! suggestion then resulted.

As the individual responsible for releasing or denying

thousands of DDO documents in response to FOIA requests, and subsequently

anshering for DDO decisions in affidavits and court depositions, I kno

non hell fred does his work and how richly he deserves this promotion to

As you know, OB is not reticent about expressing hiy views, and in the informa

and his Fitness Reports refloct that face.

Fred had been in FR from 1970-1975,

that his Fitness Reports for the past years would

put him in a neutral middle, or even low middle, ranking among B/0, officers.

that's yesterday.

Today, as I tried to say strongly in my & August memo, my view ot his work is

Outstanding--and I don't so rate many officers. . I would hope his present

stand on its own merit, and project forward, expecting FOIA to be a way of

life in the DDO with all the management challenge, and headache,

that poses. His

present and future peer competition-should be with the A/C crowd, -not the B/05 group---

if that hurdle is determining.

At the risk of being irritating, I feel bound to state his case in what I con-

sider the appropriato competitive environment, to avoid an out-of-cyclo suggestion

doing mischief to the system. Any hope?

SUBJECT:

Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recormendation:

Fred Randall

1.

Ne've spoken of the need to look further at both Agency

and DDO implications of the Freedom of Information Act and, now,

the Privacy Act, including the increased number of appeals and

litigation cases, and of the logic of collecting a coterie of

deponents or affiants to take some of the load off of both you

and me.

The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents

must include 14's and 15's, to incorporate the necessary clout

with the divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information

to the outside world.

2.

Fred is a GS-14/7. He had just come to me at the time of

the last GS-15 panel exercise and had not been recommended for

promotion by FRD.

I consider his performance over the past 6 months

to have been Outstanding.

He is head and shoulders above the other

directorates' FlOs; I have considerable laudatory testimony from

OGG, OLC, 0/DDA and within the DDO as to his professionalism, tact,

persuasiveness, analytic skills and realistic, while tough-minded,

• protection of DDO sources and methods.

This includes occasional

arm-wrestling with DDO branch/division/staff chiefs, OCC and OLC

lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his current grade level.

3.. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle promotion

recommendation to GS-15 with Ev, who, in turn, has mentioned it

to Gordon. The return signals I got sounded positive.

4. I do, therefore, reconnend that you, approve fred's pronotion

to GS-15, effective as soon as the action can he cut.

for this period.

atelcentional job of supervising, motivating,

requiring both close attention to detail and constant allertness to broad opérational

and policy implications.

The workload is larger and more complicatel than anything

1 know of handled by any line operationt officer with equivalent grade and responsi

bility. The preceding two fitness reports describe well the nature of the joh.

It

renains only to be noted that Mr. Randall is the perfect man for the job, combining

a romarkable match of leadership, operational sawy, legal and policy awareness and,

perhaps most important, negotiating ability with both the Agency lanyers and legisla-

tive counsels, and the operating divisions in a bizarre situation that completely

transcends the DO's need-to-know practices (Top Secret and compartmented, higotted

information must be reviewed) and yet riquires the protection of our sources

and

methods.

Dedicated, discreet, smart, and honest, Mr. Randall is very likely one of

very few DO officers of his grade who could have handled this job from scritch, done

so with virtually

flawless output, and created a hody of judgments and advice that is

trusted, proven and amounts to de facto Do policy on how to protect our secrets.

Prior to that we had been colleagues in Services Staff, whose

chief wrote Mr. Randall's Fitness Report.

No. change in function

accompanied the change in organization,

however, and the praise

contuined in those carlier reports could be echoed here..

During 1977, Mr. Randall

and his group have continued to render

this Directorate

outstanding service in an arena where there is little

glory but the constant threat of disaster.

In the preparation of

materials for relcuse under FOlA, the Privacy Act or E.O. 11652, the

researcher treads a fine, barely visible line between protection of

operational secrets and revelation of material properly releasable

since I

it scoms, is it necessary

to have a Reviewing Official for this interim rosort: the DDO has

suggested, in commenting on my out-of-cycle recommendation of 8 August. 75

• for Mr. Randall's promotion, that a memorandum be submitted recommending

a OSI at this time.

I consider Mr. Randall's performince as DDO/FIO (now DDO/PIC, for

an informed, tough-minded approach toward sources and methods protection.

I have received considerable laudatory conment about his work from OGC,

OLC, O/DDA and within the DO.

From a one-man operation with secretary, the fOlA activity expanded

in four months to an approved T/O ot

with a pending request for 5 more,

and the possibility of further increases depending on public reaction to the

Privacy Act and the amount of litigation that develops.

Frod has done an

excellent job of selecting his staff for what is an often frantic:

frustrating

an long-houred environment; he

also manages them well, with humor and

compassion and with high analysis and output standards.

He is conscious of

cost, particularly

in human effort, in this exercise and of the need for

the application of secrecy criteria in today's environment.

am, obviously, impressed and pleased with his assistance, and feel

omfortably supported by his group's efforts in avoiding or preparing sor

REVIEWING OFFICIALS COMMENTS (Frederick C. Randall)

I concur generally with the comments of the rating officer.

I believe Mr. Randall has shown improvement in hia handline of hia

Branch Chief responsibilities. I agree that he has shown greater

initiative in this reporting period than in the previous ones, however,

I would still like to see a somewhat greater and quicker recognition

on Mr. Randall's part of operational problem areas. Granted that thie

la a talent that is frequently hard to develop, it ie nonetheless, essential

for all Branch' Chiefs in this Division to achieve a high degree of

operational perspicacity, Mr. Randall has the ability and needs only

additional experience to improve his focus

He is a thoughtful and considerate

supervisor,

respected by his subordinates and he ropresenta the Divialon

very well indeed.

Mr. Randall's career would be onhanced were he in

a position to accept a field assignment which would got him into direct

operational contact,

for family medical reason he will apparently be confined to the

Headquartera area for an indefinite period. On balance, I consider him

to be a good Branch Chief who willingly works long hours and does hia

Job well.

3. Reviewing Official'a Comments:

I concur generally with the above rating. I also observed in the

early days of Mr. Randall's assignment as Branch Chief, that his per-

formance could certainly have been stronger. It took him somewhat

longer than I had anticipated to really take charge of his Branch. However,

I feel that as he has continued in this assigninent he has made very definite

progress. He is now generally well informed on the operational activities

taking place in his area and has begun to exercist a greater degree of

initiative and aggressiveness in handling the operational matters that cross

his dosk. Had i been the rating officer I probably would have given Mr.

Randall a somewhat lower, more qualified "Strong" rating. If he continues

to improve in the months ahead as he has in the past several, I believe he

can earn an unqualified "Strong" rating for this performance.

would

rate it "atrong". I consider Mr. Randall a capable officor, but

Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff in February

Mr. Randall's performance since reporting to this

He is currently responsible for a staff

of 12 cloyces and with the inciasing responsibilities as a result

ot

the chactient of the Privacy Act it is anticipated that additional

personnel will be required in order to handle the workload.

Mr. Randall has been responsive in the handling of FOI

requests and is noted for his professionalism,

and analytic skills. Ile has done an excellent job of establishing

realistic manpower requirements for the Privacy and Information

Gorlinator Staff, ketping up with a heavy workload while training

A: It is my opinion, and also Ol's, that Me. Pandall's strengths

aro in a staff assignment such is his current one.

Therefore, follow-

Ing discussions with Mr. Randall, it was agreed that his home-basc

functional category should be changel from IMC to DAC.

If there are any ndditional questions concoming this
