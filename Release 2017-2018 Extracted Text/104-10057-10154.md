The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

Frank FIORINI,

of Watergate notoriety who also has a

long-time record of

falsely claiming Agency affiliation.

the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly

thereafter

Claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Communist Brigade:

A reported sub-unit of this

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

a memorandum by

the writer dated 10 June

1975 in thẻ name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNI, Jr:;

and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written b

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

Sin America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY.

One of the najor

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

Jr. to Frank. STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is

interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and

another cohort,

Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
