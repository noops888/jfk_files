Long to Gebhardt Memo

Re: Alleged tapping of telephone of

â€¢. U. S. Senator Howard Baker

SECREM

Gibson advised that during the course of a normal

working day two or three men usually enter and work in the

sub-leased SCI space.

They stay during the course of an

entire day without leaving the space and do not seem to

conduct business in a normal manner. An unidentified

friend of Gibson's overheard individuals in the space,

allegedly leased by DEA, discussing "tapes."

Based on

the

above information and based on Gibson's experience with

was being conducted in the space allegedly sub-leased by

DEA from SCI.

Since it appeared that an ongoing CIA operation

was being compromised and that the CIA should be aware,

CIA, Atlanta (SJ

1028 Connecticut Avenue, is a suite

located on the

twelfth floor, which is

utilized

as an efficiency apartment.

It is connected to Suite 1109 on the floor below by stairway.

Gibson said the twelfth floor space is actually the space

sub-leased to Conein and that telephone number 785-4514 is

installed in that space.

Conein sub-leased this apartment

in March, 1974, and was still being used by Conein as of

7/5/74-681(4)

Regarding the information above concerning the

alleged overhearing of discussions concerning "tapes," by

alleged DEA employees, Gibson advised this information

we oncoming they

was furnished to him by Mr. Steve Van Cleave, a personal

friend of Gibson's and a private investigator from

Atlanta, Georgia. Van Cleave told Gibson that he

visited SCI offices on a recent unrecalled date. Van Cleave

was told by Werbell that Van Cleave could not stay in the

offices at that time as Werbell was consulting with a

client.

Van Cleave told Gibson he then went to the twelfth

floor entryway to scI offices, the space sub-leased by

Conein, and overheard a conversation through the door (u)
