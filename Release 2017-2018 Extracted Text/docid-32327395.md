MI. CISNEROS stated he listened to the re-

cording but he did not know what significance it might

have since he could not understand it and therefore

he desired to turn it over to the FBI as possibly

being a coded message by anti-CASTRO elements. He

enrade ould appear, or at least be his guess that

"sansmission was being sent from the area

Boston probably directed to Cuba. Mr. CISNEROS

stated ALDO GIL at Littleton, Massachusetts could furnish

further details and also the name of the JURE member in

the Boston area who monitored and recorded the trans-

transmissions of a similar nature have also been re-

to FBI, Miami. U
