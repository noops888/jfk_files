This noperandum deals with recommendations of SAC, Miami, for

incentive audras and other commendatory action for Miami personnel wha

participated in the investigation and arrest of the subjects on 1/27/60.

By way of background, Miami

received information early on 1/27/60 that

Valdes had arrived in Miami from Cuba and was seeking contact with local

police officer who would be willing to assist cuban agents in abducting

Rolando Masferter, anti-Castro leader. Miami arranged to have an agent,

SA William Bo

Holloman, pose as local deputy sheriff and thereafter meet

we Tale desent hotel can matin adde was acon anted boned:

Holloman to assist in abduction of Masferrer for $25, 000. At conclusion

of meeting and by prearranged signal, other Miami agents moved in and

arrested subjects on kidnap - conspiracy charge, a complaint having

previously been authorized that day by local Us attorney subjects

nave been arraigned and are presently awaiting trial.

Fernandez' is identical with Mu 635-s, heretofore valuable security

informant of Miami in Cuban field. Fernandez has claimed he had no prior

knowledge of kidnap plot prior to his actual appearance at meeting with

Valdes and Holloman and was, therefore, unable to forewarn Miami of plot

or his involvement.

His story appears

plausible but it appears his arrest

was unavoidable under the circumstances.

239%

Bureau has received considerable favorable publicity as a result of t

this incident, chiefly in miami press but also to some extent nationally

Moreover, the

incident has served notice on Castro regime that U.S. will f

not tolerate illegal activities of this type.. Miami office exercised

noteworthy initiative, resourcefulness,

and imagination in handling this

matter and it is particularly worthy of note that the entire operation

mately seven hours Miami learned of plot, arranged to Rave special

was vonceived and handie in lese then a day. During prica an appeal

credentials prepared for SA Holloman in lie role as locol deputy oner fi,

discussed the matter with U.s. attorney'e office and arranged for
