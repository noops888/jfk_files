Request of JFK Assassination Records

Review Board for Courtesy Visit with DCI

1. Action Requested: Paragraph 4 below contains a

recommendation for your approval.

The Chairman of the JFK

Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), John Tunheim,

requested that you meet with him and the other four Board

members at Headquarters Building some time in the next several

months.

He asks that the meeting be arranged to coincide with

one of their monthly sessions, which are held in Washington.

(The schedule of their meetings is attached.) The Board's

Executive Director, David Marwell, would also participate.

2.

Background: Mr. Tunheim, recently appointed a

federal judge in Minnesota, would like to provide you with

a brief description of the Board's purpose and activities.

The Board has paid similar visits to the FBI, where they -

met with Director Freeh, and to NSA and the Secret Service.

The TREB members were appointed by President Clinton in 1993

as required by statute. Their principal responsibility is to

ensure public disclosure of government records related to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

The statute grants the

Board full access to all documents that are related to either

the assassination or past investigations into the assassina-

tion.

3. CIA has worked closely with the Board and its staff

from the beginning.

The Board's Executive Director and we have

worked out cooperative

arrangements for resolving differences

of opinion as to what information can be released to the public

and what should be withheld because of sensitivities.

We have

released approximately 227,000 pages of relevant Agency records

DAVID G. MARWELL

Biographical Information

i July 1, 1994, the Berlin Document Center (BDC) was transferred to the German

Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv) marking the end of nearly 48 years of American control

of this unique organization. With an estimated 25 million Nazi-era personnel-related files,

the BDC was once a crucial source of evidence for the Nuremberg Trials and is today an

incalculably important source for the study of the Third Reich. The transfer also marked

the end of David Marwell's tenure as Director of the BDC.

A well-trained scholar with a PH.D. in History, Marwell came to Berlin in 1988 from

the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), U.S. Department of Justice where he held the

position of Chief of Investigative Research. At OSI, he was involved in researching and

preparing cases against accused Nazi war criminals residing in the United States. In

addition, he was selected to participate in the Klaus Barbie Investigation (1983) and played

a major role in the Josef Mengele investigation (1985), both of which received

international attention.

In connection with the Joseph Mengele and Klaus Barbie investigations, Marwell was

in charge of assembling all relevant documentary evidence relating to any possible

connection between these individuals and U.S. institutions or personnel. The

investigations were two of the most unusual ever undertaken and through them he gained

significant experiences in the identifying and locating documentary resources. The former

Director of OSI, Allan A. Ryan, Jr., in his book Quiet Neighbors: Prosecuting Nazi War

Criminals in America, described Marwell as "an experienced and careful historian who

could find documents in archives when no one else could."

When Marwell arrived at the Document Center, the institution had been rocked by a

scandal involving a significant theft of documents. The resulting focus on the Center

revealed that it had been neglected in many areas for many years and suffered from an

outmoded administrative structure, a disaffected and undertrained staff and a lack of

professional guidance. It was Marwell's job to bring the Center up to standard and prepare

it for turnover to the German govemment.

The challenges facing Marwell were not only to manage a complex institution (with

an annual budget of eight million deutschmarks) and repair past deficiencies, but also to

define a future for an institution in transition. He prepared a "five year plan" for the BDC

that set five goals, developed a corresponding program to meet each goal, and designed a

system to monitor the progress. In achieving all of the goals, Marwell:

• Introduced computer technology (there was not a single computer at the

BDC when he arrived) and developed a sophisticated, integrated information

retrieval system that has been described as a model for archive

→ administration;

• Created a fully professional document conservation and restoration program;

• Developed a staff (50 Germans and 20+ Americans) that is better trained and

far more responsible, flexible and creative than it had been;
