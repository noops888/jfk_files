The resson the scurce wont Into the Italian Sabassy was that

he wus arrested by Ramiro Valdez and Manuel Pineiro on the charge of

haviog monitored telephone calls of Fidel Castro and other officials

of the Criban Government. Source said thie was partially true, as the

operators at the sonitoring site would llstan to such conversations and

then tell him of the contents.

arter being released by G-2, the source went into the Sierra

Escambray Mountains as a guerrilla. He stayed for about I0 days, and

came dowa in October of 1960 after Sinesto Walsh was killed.

6. Source gave the organization of the (MRP) allitary section

which he heade as follows:

The top coumand 18 known a Estado Mayor de Operaciones Militar

It consiste of five people.

Three are active allitary officers.

They Include one major (navy), one captain, and one first lieutcnant.

One tan 1s a retired officer of the rebel army. The flith person 18

Two elements subordinate to theRMCM are the Comando Accion

(CA) and Inteligencia-1 (I-1).

Underneath the staff structure, a and b abore, the organizatior

l0 broken down into provincial units. Each province la directed by a

"Mando"

which are numbered from 1-6, corresponding to the six provinces

or Cuba: Each province thereby being inow as Mando-1 (M-1) to Mando-6

(11-5) .

Each Mando is divided Into five Comando Estrategico (CE) and

each CE 1s divided Into five columas:

• Laca columna has 100-112 people,

divided Into four companies. A company is made, up of four squade of

eight men eash.

do The members of the CA are merged into the sub-paragraph e

It has been found, he said, that because a person 1n a member

of the litary as all people In the military section are, se does not

seem that he is necessarily qualified for comando or sabotage work.

Therefore, the best have been selected and can be called for action.

However,

the military section has very little ("cas1 isis") arms or

explosives.

T. Source said that In December 1961, and Janusy 1952, the EMOM

made an islandwide survey of the organization and on the basis of the

survey calculates that about 7,000 men belons to the military section.

Taking Into account that pergonal and fantly problems shich might

preclude a man's taking action could come up, it Is estinsted that

about 3,000-4,000 men could be counted upon.
