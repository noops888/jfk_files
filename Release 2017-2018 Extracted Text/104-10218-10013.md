See paragraph I below.

NO COMING N14ARID

ONE FINEGO SILE

AN ATTA SINNER

1, Your assistance is requested in intervlewing

for information which would be helpful to thia Government

in determining the accuracy of certain claims made confidentially by

Herbert I ITKIN. Mr. ITKIN is a prime vitness in legal procoedinga presently

underway in New York City Involving the Mafia and related underworld orgariza-

Hone. ITKIN lives under the protection of U.S. Federal Marshale.

2. The following data is for your information. It should not be used in

dealing with

or outside of this Organization.

ITKIN has been an

FBI Informant since March 1963.

He has now claimed to have worked for thie

Organization daring the period 1954/55 to 1960. ITKIN asserts that his contact

during these years was one Philip HARBIN. This inquiry is concerned solely

with ITKIN's claimed rolationhip with this Organization from 1954/55 to 1960

when he alleges HARBIN was his contact. As will be sees.

ITKIN

alleges, also knew RABBIN during that time and that fach, therefore, le

material to tho credibility of ITKIN's story.

ITKIN's frst contact with Philip HARBIN was in 1955 when he claime to

have been contacted purguant to a mecting be, ITIIN, had in Philadelphia with

a leading personality of this Organization and znother high-goverument official

late in 1954 or carly 1955.

According to ITKIN, HARBIN never made the

spectfc claim of being from thin Organization but that was ITIN's asaumption.

ITION describes HARBIN as about 42 or 43 (in 1955), an American.

He had receding hair, combed back but parted. He was about 5'g" ia height,

periodically in New York City. ITKIN alleges that he passed to HARBIN copies

of the correspondence developed by his law firm, Delson, Levin and Gordon,

dealing with Indonesia, Burma, and India. ITKIN left that law firm in mid-1957,

presumably tbereby losing total access. Among the materials ITKIN claims he

passed to HARBIN before he left the Delson, Levin and Gordon firm was luforma

Government of

who was studying either at New Yor. University or Columbia

where he prepared a master's thesis on

economic position

HARBIN, he says, was interested in the topic and ITKIN alleges he furnished

HARBIN notes of

monograph.

Sometime presumably after mid-year 1957, HARBIN asked ITKIN if he

knew anybody else who could do (intelligence) work. ITKIN recalled/

who meanwhile had moved to;the position as Consul General of

ITKIN provided an introduction for HARBIN by letter, which he sent to

ITKIN asserts that HARBIN- according to his own statement -

and made the "new contact", ITKIN claims he last saw

went to

HARBIN in 1960.

3. A comparison between the key points of ITKIN's account as suramarized

In the irmediately preceding paragraph with the data set out in Attachment A and

E will show immediate contradictions that tend to destroy any credibility in

ITKIN's account, particularly with respect to his relationship to

We also point out, solely for your information, that we have found no confirmia: :.

tion in our records of any relationship between this Organization and ITKiN during

the period 1954-1960, No traces have been found in our records or anywhere in

government thus far of a Philip HARBIN, and there is explicit denial thät there was

any meeting in Philadelphia in 1954 between ITIIN and the high officials he

nominates.

Finally, there is no substantiation in our files of any of the intelli

gence product which ITKIN allegedly passed to HARBIN. This case, however, le

al such a nature that we must strive, if possible, to have

statement for the record.

4. We leave to the Station determination of the best manner to approach

It is our preference that a Station officer, under suitable cover,

performa the interview, but it may vell be that a consular or emubasay officer

might be the best person to do the job. H'e repeat that we are concerned in this

matter solely with the verification or denial of ITKIN's statements, specifically

the allegation that be introduced HARBIN to

and

that as a consequence

would be in a position to identify and describe

HARBIN in a way that would permit us to locate him if be exists. The request

assistance in this matter is in no way predicated upon hostility

towards ITKIN nor is there any predisposition against his claims if indeed

evidence is found to back them up. If

indicates that he is willing to

provide whatever information he can, you can assure him that his information is

solely for U.S. Government use and will not be made public by us at any time

without his expressed consent. Also, it is clear that we are prepared to accept

hie decision to give no assistance in the matter.

5. We have compiled a short statement that might be used by the interviewer

to explain to

the purpose of the interview. (see Attachment B), A list

of questions, which should be given orally, in elaborated in Attachment C. You

will note that these questions concern the larger as well as narrower clements

of

relations with ITKIN. Wa are willing in settle for a specifie

answer to the narrower question of Philip HARBIN in preference to generalizations

about the whole relationship. Il, as a consequeuce of your handling.

is willing to talk in depth, we will be grateful.

6. Attachment Dis a copy of a New York Times article concerning ITKIN and

one of the completed federal'

cases in New York CitY. This item is attached for

your background reading. This may be shown lo

of course.

Attachment E is a copy of a letter dated 26 February 1965 from

to

ITKIN. Again, the content of this letter tends to support the theory that iTKIN'e

story, as elaborated in paragraph 2 above, is a fabrication. While possibly based

on a real relationship, it appears to be a fabrication with respect to chronology

and with respect to the exact mutual interests involved.. Also included in this

attachment is ITKIN's answer to the letter. We feel in retrospect that

might be unhappy to read his own letter in the course of a consular

interview. We, therefore, auggest that this not be shown to him. However,

there is no objection to an indication that the U.S. Government is aware that

was in períectly correct correspondence with ITKIN during 1965 on

business mattors.

%

We would appreciate compliance at your earliest convenience and a pre

liminary indication by cable of

response, if one is forthcoming, on

the questione conceringl

_knowledge of HARBIN. If there is anything

unclear la this dispatch, Headquarters would welcome any questions by cable.
