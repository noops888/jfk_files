MEISORANDUM POR: Cilel, FI/Stalf

SUBJECT:

Arthur Go VAIVADA - Request for Frozotion....

1. •It is requested that Arthur G. Vaivada, a Career Agent, be promoted

from GS-1] to grade GS-12 for his outstanding performance in carrying out a

precarious mission in line with the objectives of Project A PHODARCH, In

which he is the Principal igent.

2. In early January 1958, Vaivada volunteered to undertake a mission to

contact Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro Ruz in the Sierra Maestra mountains

in south-eastern Cuba.

He arranged for his free passage into the Sierras

through contacts within the 26 July Movement which he and the Station.

developed earlier.

After the necessary arrangements, Valvada left La Habana

on 5 April 1958 for Santiago de Cuba, from where he left for the Sierras

under the escort of rebel guides. In the course of approximately twenty

days' stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headquarters, during which

time he was exposed to many hardships and great personal risks, he accompanied

Castro and a force of about 200 rebels on their dawn attack on the town of

Manzanillo on 26 March 1958.

At Manzanillo, Vaivada broke off contact with

the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana.

3. During bis relatively short stay in the Sierra Maestra mountains,

Valvada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational

information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographie

coverage of his trip.

This exploit is another achievement to be added to the impressive

past performances of Arthur G. Vaivada, who has always shown a deep devotion.

5. Valvada has born on L

and has been idth CIA since 1949.

He has been a career agent since 1 June 1957, ana was promoted to the grade

of GS-11 on 1 June 1957. His tour of duty in Cuba was from August 1954 until

32 March 1958.

MEMORA DUM

SUBJECT:

Arthur

Veivara

subject of our jetter nuider 4025; interest in Assignment

in U.s.

1.

In recent conversations with both JRe and ROS, Subject hag

broached the prospect of a possible assignment within the U.s. follow-

ine completion of his Mabana assignrent.

He says he would not want his

statenents

re reassignment which were recently forwarded to Headquarters

to be interprated to nean that he is not interested in a u.S. tour.

ile

sajs that he has been giving mich thought to his future career, as well

as to the needs of his family.

ne points out that he personally has now

spent approximately. 16 years, excepting

vacations and short training

periods, living ma working

outside the U. So, that his two chilaren

have never lived there, and that doth he and his wile are concerned

that

too much time will elapse before they can provide their children

with a period in the U.S. auring their forkative years.

2.

It is the opinion of both KUS and JHP that Subject is at a

point in his carser developtent where a tour at Headquarters would

be extremely beneficial.

The Station lacks knowledge concering the

specific readquarters jobs to which a person of subject's status might

be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR soretimes employs

these persons as instructors. le believe that a tour with UTh would

not only renedy in great measure deficiencies in Subjest's background

caused by lack of Headquarters experience, but would at the sane time

afford ViR excellent instructor material.

3. In view of Subject's own interest in such an assignment, and

our estinate of tos potential value to him and to the Organization

that would accrue from it, we recommend tnat Headquarters arrange such

an assignment 1f at all possible.

4o In view of the likelihood of Subject's transfer in the near.

future, a prompt decision is requested.

Reference:

HIH-#-2380, dated 16 October 1957-

The subject has no objection to subnitting to an LOFLUTTER test

at the convenience of Headquarters.

in the event ar LOFLUTTER team is passing, or could pass, through Habana;

on the other hand, VAIVADA could just as easily to to any designated place

in Florida in order to take this test.

It is undersicod that LOZLUTTER

teams from time to time visit that state.

The Station will take such measures as are feasible to cover the

activities of Subject and his wife while in Habana.

While the matter was not raferred to in the reference, Sueject's

projected one-jear tour of duty will erd in june, 1958, at which time it

is VAIVADA's desire to leare Cuba for a reassimment in arother area in

his present line of overational work and under similar unofficial cover

conditions.

A detailed dispatch on this subject will shortly be trans-

mitted to Headsuarters; it is referred to here so that the readquarters

desk may be alerted to the need for considering what assignments would

be open to VAIZADi during the Spring or Surmer of 1958.

SUBJECT

• Request for conversion of Arthur Go LATVADA FOR

Contract to Staff Status

REFERENCE

: HKH-A-2577

1.

Referenced dispatch fron the field recoumends the comersion

of contract, agent Arthur G. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents

& strong case for such conversion.

VAIVADA has served CIA in a con-

tract capacity since 1949, witin a continuous high lavel of perfor-

mance; first in

later in Guatenali and Cuba.

he is cur-

rently assigned to Cuba and is expectat to remain there indepinitely.

VAIVADA is 3h years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent

of & GS-10 rating.

His expressed career interests lie in contired

enployment by CIA, more especially in the area ofunofficial cover

assignments, for which he is highly suited.

2.

Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1915) 1s a Costa Plean

citizen, a situation which complicates his proposed conversion sone-

what.

She has expressed a desire to acquire U.S. citizenship, however,

and it has been determined that this can be arranged within the next

several months, barring unforeseen developments. She will be required

to spend most

of this period in the U.S. and is currently saring

plans, to do. so.

3. In view of TAllADA's outstanding record as a contract agent,

his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a

career with CIA, it is recomnended that he be granted staff status

at grade CS-11,

contingent upon his wife's first beconing a U.S.

citizen, and providing he can meet Security and other requirements.

There 1s avatlable in iH Division a staff-position (BAF-409) to

which VAIVADA can be assigned.

4. WH Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for

covert training in the near futire.

Approval for the conversion of VAIlADi from contract to

staff status, as indicated above, 18 hereby requested.

2.

Considering the possibility that such a reavest wight be

turned down, the undersigned discassed with

_ the proce-

dures for acquisition of citizenship for Mrg. VAIVADA, and deter.

minad that this should be relatively simple.

The requirements were?

presence in the U.3. (vicinity of Washington) for approxinately

forty-live days with some additional time to acquire passport.. So

the basic requiremente would be: ability to speak English and to

pass a relatively simple test based on pamphlet which would be given

to her for study.

she arrives in the States.

& Proposed Staff Status for Arthur G. VAIVADA

HKH-4-2577, 17 April 1956

lo Referenced dispatch from the field recoumends the conversion

of contract agent Arthur C. VAIVADA to staff status, and presents a

good case for such conversion.

VAIVADA has served CIA 10 & contract

capacity since 1949 with a continuous high level of parformance; firat

later in Guatemala and Cuba. He 1a 3u years old and

was pronoted recently to the equivalent of a grade GS-10. His ex

proased career interests lie in continued employment by CIA, more

especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments; for which

he is highly suited.

2.

Unfortung tely Subject's spouse (since 1945) 15 a Costa:

Rican citizen.

Prelininary investigation at Headquarterg has revealed

that subject's conversion to staff status is virtually out of the

question so long as his vife remains an alien.. It has also been de

termined, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citizenghip vithin

a span of 15 days if she so desires and 1s willing to cons to the

U.S. for thet period of tima.

This would remove the major stunbling

block to acquisition of staff status for VAIVADA.

3. In view of VAIVADA'& outstanding record as a contract agent,

his strong overall qualifications and his expressed desire for a ca-

reer with cIA, it la recommended that (a) VAIVADA's wife be encoursged

to seek U.S: citizenship under the terms outlined above (D) VAIVADA

be granted staff status, contingent upon bis wife's first becoming

a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet all other requiremente.

C, WH/IIT has endorsed the récomendation for staff status and a sug-

gestion by C/W#/Adiain that BAP-409, a new position currently allotad

be transferred to Habana to be filled by VAIVADA.

It is further recomended that la Division consider bring

1ng. VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincide with his mite's

stay (at Headquarters" convenience).. This would facilitate acquisi-

Con of citizenship for the wile and at the same time afford VAIVADA

a chance for additional Headguarters training. Subject previously

received covert training at Headquarters fron 5 October through 25

Hovember 1953-

Careful

consideration has been given to a mumber of ideas, all of which vere

rejected because possible local conflicts.. This idea is still general

enough (and I hope contincing) to leave opportunity for changes ard/or

improvenent at Headquarters.

The idea, and the terrinology, was

gleaned from the pages of "Investrent in Cuba", a July 1955 study

published by the U.S. Department of Commerce,

As I understand this cover arrengement, the isi should mail me

a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed infornation.

should "hold us" for a couple of months, with possibly some queries fron

me occasionally.

Then when our operational picture requires investigation

in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to

request a survey of poll

in that field..

3. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and

allied naterials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration

of this "Agency" and then advise PSI as to the legal requirement.

NEHORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Vaivada

Lo During the morning of 30 April Mr.

phoned regarding Subject, citing IN 35508.

said that

he would be meeting with Vairada at 1500 hours today and proposed

providing him with a temporary rather than permanent cover with

the new cover company which was being contemplated for long-range

development. Iro

reasoning was that he did not wish

to place Vaivade under the new company with the chance that the

triai perioi approved for the Station might cause Vaivada to be

pulled out from that.cover in short order.

kro

said that

the temporary cover he intended offering Vaivada would be adequate.

2. I concurred with the above proposal.

visional covert security approsal is granted for the use of the

Subject, as described in your request as set forth in paragraph #1,

3.

It should be noted that the provisional covert security

desire at a later date to charge the status or use of this individual,

a request for approval to cover pny proposed change should bo subaiitad
