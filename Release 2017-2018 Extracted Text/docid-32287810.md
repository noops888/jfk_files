At the Blue Seas the manager has been developed as a

PCI. At the Golden Gate the manager is most cooperative and

will assist the Bureau in every way possible. At the remaining

above motels and hotels investigation has proved most difficult

due to the fact those individuals managing the same cannot be

trusted and have proved uncooperative in furnishing any informa-

tion on a confidential basis. In an attempt to develop

SOUrCEs

and informants at the same our program has been to develop

switchboard operators, bookkeepers, office employees, individuals

operating the door, bell captains, maitre d's, etc.
