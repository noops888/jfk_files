Senator Frank Church

United States Senate

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Church:

Taking the liberty of presuming on our short past acquain-

tance, I am writing you to express my deep concern over the

tragic adverse criticism being levelled at the FBI in the

news media as a result of current congressional inquiries

into United States intelligence operations.

As you well know, ninety per cent (90%) of the work of

the Bureau is concentrated on the investigation of violations

of U. S. criminal

statutes over which the FBI has primary

investigative jurisdiction. Your committee and the other

committees of the Congress now looking into the activities of

the Bureau are therefore examining and criticizing the work

which constitutes a very small percentage of their overall

responsibility.

Not to stress the long and successful history

of the Bureau along with the few mistakes (the Congress itself

has had its share) they have made over the years is, I think,

unfair and not in the national Interest.

Just one example of

the effect these stories are having occured Sunday, November 30ch,

when the Washington Post carried a letter to the Editor entitled

"The FBI Discredited"

That letter followed testimony before

and its officials.

Secondly, you know and I know,

as a former congressional

investigator,

that each and every witness is interviewed by

committee staff members long before he formally appears before

the committee.

For the life of me I cannot understand why

a reputable and responsible congressional committee would

allow testimony to be put on the record when it had already

been denied by officials of the FBI and was, in fact, untrue.

I refer, for

example, to statements made by Mr. Rowe last week.

This Nation is in grave danger of having its greatest

law enforcement agency (FBI) unnecessarily destroyed based on,

at least partially, untrue and/or unsubstantiated statements

of witnesses.

•I urge you, Senator, to be fair and judicious. To my

mind the current rash of congressional hearings have not been

that.

Proper and effective law enforcement cannot be realized

without the full voluntary cooperation of the citizens of this

country.

Congressional hearings and the news media are dis-

troying that bond sometimes for nothing more than political

ambition, financial reward or basic dislike of law enforcement

agencies

themselves.

I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of this

letter to Senator Tower, my two Senators and my Congressman.

Respectfully yours

QUESTIONS AND RUSEONGES RE: TOMAS RIHA

1. Q. Was Mrs. Moria (Calya) Tannenbaum of Denver and Coulder,

Colorado, ever employed directly or indirectly by the INS?

When?

In what capacity?

A.

A thorough search of all retrievable personnel records for

the U. S. Inmigration end laturalization Service (INS) dis-

closed no record of a Mrs. Cloria (Galya) Tannenbaum nee

Forest, having ever been employed directly or indirectly by

this Service in any capscity.

Z. Q. lias Mrs. Tannenbaum ever hired by INS in connection with the

visa status of Riha's wife, Mrs. Hann Riha, Formerly liana

Frushkava or IIrushkovnova?

A. Hirs. Tannenbaum was

never hired by INS In connection with the

visa statur of Riha's wife, Mrs. Hana Riha nee rushkova.

3. 0.

what inquiry was made by John L. Todd, INS District Director

in denver, after he received a call early on the morning

of karch 9, 1969, Involving s disturbance et the Thomas Nihn

home In Boulder, Colorado?

The disturbance involved Rib?,

lies. Ionenbeum and lirs. Inna Riha end etler placed in Mrs. Riha's

bedrcom, apparently to overcone her.

A. A thorough review of officinl farvice files C-7 105 013 (Thomas

Riha) and A14 627 222 (lena Riha) contains no written materini

indicating that then District Director John L. Todd (now retired)

had received a coll early on the morning of larch 9, 1969, rela-

ting to a disturbance occurring at the home of Thomas Rihn, involv-

ing Hrs. Tannenbaum, Mrs. linna Riha and her husband Thomas.

does not necessarily mean that he did not receive such a chll but

merely that he made no written record of same, if in fact he

received such a call.

Irrespective of such a call, the imminration status of lits. Hand

Riha was already a matter of Service inquiry initiated by the

New York office of INS predicated upon a sixth preference petition

filed in her behalf as a secretary, to sustain an application she

filed seeking to adjust her immigration status to that of a lawful

During the pendency of processing this

application, Mrs. liha had received an extension of her temporary

stay to October 20, 1968, to complete a period of prectical training.

On January 28, 1969, the New York office of this Service

addressed a request

to Fana Riha to appesi for an inter-

view on February 5, 1969, This letter was returned to the

New York office bearing an endorsement by lena Riha's aunt

advising of Hena's marriage to a U. S. citizen on October 13,

1968, and her current address in Boulder, Golorado. Accord-

ingly, the Service file was transferred to the Denver office

for continuance of this inquiry.

the service file of Mrs, lana Rihe contains a hand written

memorandum dated March 7, 1969, indicating a Mrs. Ionnenbrum

had called regarding this case.

Tannenbaum wanted to know

what was necessary for approval of an Immediate relative visa

petition. Iannenbaum wonted to get it done right away since

the husband (Thomas Riha) was getting a divorce from the allen

(Hana Riha), Also of record in this file are typewritten let-

ters addressed to the Denver office dated March 8 and 2, 1969,

respectively and bearing a signature "Hana Riha" in which the

writer, snong other matters, designates Mrs. Tannenbaum as the

person she desires to handle her business with the Immigration

Service and that all correspondence relating thereto be directed

to Tannenbaum's home address.

Cumulatively these letters allege that her marriage to Thomas

Riha was induced by her. Aunt, Mrs. Gressman, as i reans of

circumventing the immigration laws and establishing, permanent

residence status in the U. S. although she cleims she is un-

decided as to whether in fact she desires to remain in the

United States.

4. Q. What were the findings of Todds Inquiry?

A Predicated upon the referenced letters (supra) and the fact

that Mrs. Riba had overstayed her lawful admission, to vit,

October 20, 1968, Mistrict Director Todd approved an ep. lice-

tion for an Order to Show Cause prepared by a Service inves-

tigator on lnrch 10, 1969, and on March Il, 1969, issued and

signed an Order to Show Cause and Notice of Hearing on Mrs. Niha

charging her with being subject to deportation pursuant to the

provisions of Section 241(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationa-

lity Act, in that, after admission as # nonimmigrant, she had

remained in the United States for a longer time than permitted.

This Order and Notice were served on Mrs. Riha by registered

mail on larch 11, 1969, directing her to appear for a hearing

theone as tin The at 2:80 a the chay, a to 23, 13đ

March 21, 1969, the Denver office received a registered letter

dated March 20, 1969, with enclosure in the form of a Notice

of Appearance as attorney for Hana Riha, in which a continuance

of the scheduled deportation hearing was requested and granted.

The file of Hans Riha contains & memorandum dated April 10,

1969, prepared for the file by then District Director Todd

reportinz that at 10:30 P.M. in the evening of April 9, 1969,

he was telephonically contacted at his home by a reporter from

the stoff of the Colorado Daily, Colorado University, Boulders

Colorado, who advised he was preparing an article for his paper

and desired some assistance.

The reporter stated that a

Mrs. Tannenbaum hed informed him that she was employed in some

capacity by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and that

she had the authority to direct what disposition of Mrs. Riha's

The reporter also stated that Professor Riha had disap-

peared two or three weeks before from the University and that

Mrs. Tannenbaun had stated his disaypearance was the result of

activities by the secret police of three (3) foreign countries;

that Mrs. Tannenbaum also claimed to have access to certain

intelligence information in possession of the military author-

itios.

In response to specific inquiries che reporter was ad-

vised: by District Director Todd to the effect that (1) a

irs. Gerald Tannenbaum 1s not and has never been, to his knowl

edge, an emyloyec of INS (2) that he (Todd) had no idea of what

her employment might be and (3) thrit he could give him (the re-

porter) no specific information regarding a Professor Riha, the

alleged husband of subject lana itiha.

In conclusion, the memo-

randun suggests that the reporter might desire to contact Mrs. Riha's

attorney since he had already mentioned the neme of Mrs. Riha's

attorney during the course of the conversation.

S. Q. Were these findings conmunicated to the GIA and the FBI?

A. A memorandun dated April 11, 1969, prepared by then Deputy Dis-

trict Director Lloyd D. Erowell and addressed to the file of

Jana Riha reports that on April 10, 1969, Provell telephonically

contacted the Assistant . gent in Charge of the Denver office of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation and provided him with the

substance of the information contained in District Director Todd's

memorendun of April 10, 1909, (supra) and implies that such agent

was requested to advise whether a contemplated investigation by

INS would interfere with any actions which might be under consideration

by the EBI.

Denver FBI office telephonically edvised Mr. Frowell that

hds office had a pending investigation on lies. Tannenbaun

for alleged numerous impersonations of federal officiole,

but that investigation by Ils would not interfere with their

operatione in this matter. He requested, however, that upon

completion of any investigation by IN3, his office be fur

nished a copy of the seport.

TOPIC: SEPARATION OF INTELLIGENCE GATHERING FROM LAW

ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS

The question has been raised regarding the

feasibility of separating the intelligence gathering function of

the FBI from the law enforcement function of the FBI.

The functions of the FBI do not neatly fall within

"'intelligence" and "law enforcement" categories. Internal security

cases are both intelligence and law enforcement operations and

counterintelligence sometimes involves arrests and prosecutions,

i.e., law enforcement. Thus, the functions of the FBI can more

accurately be broken down into three general missions - law

enforcement, internal security (domestic), and counterintelligence

(foreign). These missions are separate, distinct, and distinguishable

functions, even though each partakes a little of each other.

While counterintelligence could adequately, and with

more success in some cases, be handled by an organization totally

separate from one with law enforcement powers, internal security

work in many cases, is directly related to criminal prosecution.

Complete separation, at least of the internal security function from

law enforcement, does not appear to be practically feasible.

## Page 37

Separation of the internal security function also

presents serious political considerations. Internal security is

the most controversial of government's intelligence collection

activities. In the U.S., this function was originally given to the

FBI which had established for itself a reputation for being respon-

sible, competent, and most importantly, politically neutral and had

the confidence of most Americans. It is to the advantage of an

internal security agency, which is subjected to political pressures,

to be somewhat insulated by being part of a larger, respected

organization which has a high profile as a competent and fair

investigative agency in the less politically complex law enforcement

and counterintelligence fields. Adding to this insulation is the

tradition of FBI political independence, and the new Congressional

concern with keeping the FBI politically independent. While the law

enforcement and counterintelligence wings of the FBI dislike the

controversies into which its internal security wings drag the FBI name,

separation of internal security into a separate agency would probably

subject it to more intense political pressures, both from within the

administration and without, which pressures it might not be capable

of withstanding. Such separation appears politically unfeasible and

undesirable.

NY 55101 DocId:32989554 Page 37

## Page 38

:

Separation of the counterintelligence function would be

more practically feasible; however, the commingling of counterintelli-

gence and internal security interests and the threat of a merger of

the counterintelligence function with the positive foreign intelligence

collection agency, especially in the U.S., are both practical and

political reasons militating against this course.

Practical considerations against divestiture of the

counterintelligence and internal security functions from the FBI are

that: basic criminal investigative experience equips men in many

areas to be intelligence officers; a pool of trained criminal investi-

gators is available to the intelligence missions to draw from, either on

an ad hoc emergency basis, e. g., seizure of an embassy or political

kidnapping or skyjacking, or as candidates for the position of intelli-

gence officer; a divestiture might result in the loss to the counterintelli-

gence and internal security wings of the effective use of the FBI name,

reputation, and contacts/sources built-up over the years using the FBI

name.

All members of the intelligence community have specific

responsibilities defined by statutes and executive orders. The FBI

maintains close daily liaison with other agencies to insure against

NY 55101 DocId: 32989554 Page 38

---

## Page 39

repetition or overlapping activities. The Congress and the Executive

Branch, in establishing intelligence agencies such as the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency, FBI, etc., must

have considered the need to keep each agency's functions separate.

The CIA, for example, is specifically prohibited from having any

internal security or law enforcement functions. For this reason, in

addition to consideration of experience, efficiency and economy, the

FBI recommends that all three missions of law enforcement, internal

security, and counterintelligence remain with the FBI.

and directive of the Attorney General has been charged with the responsi-

bility of performing certain duties subject to the general supervision and

direction of the Attorney General. The Director of the FBI, a Bureau chief

Within the Department, having been granted enormous responsibility, must

attain a proper balance between independence and responsiveness in order

to properly discharge this responsibility.

The Director of the FBI must be permitted to discharge his

responsibilities free from political or unethical pressure. This must be

balanced with his responsibility to remain responsive to the Attorney

General's leadership and direction. A Congressional oversight committee,

available to give the FBI counsel, guidance, and direction, can greatly

assist the FBI in achieving and maintaining this balance.

There must be an efficient working relationship, with free and

open channels of communication, between the Director and the Attorney

General. However, the FBI Director must also on occasion communicate

directly with the President and members of the Congressional oversight

committee. The Director must be in a position to register reasoned

disagreement with the Attorney General and if the situation dictates, to

take up important matters of disagreement with the President and the

Congressional oversight committee.

TOPIC:

THE ASSIGNMENT OF FBI AGENTS TO FOREIGN

LIAISON POSTS

The FBI has had FBI Agents serving in foreign liaison posts

since 1940. They are known as Legal Attaches and are regularly called

upon to secure in-depth cooperation from foreign agencies on criminal

and security matters which are frequently of a complicated and sensitive

nature. In order to handle such matters effectively, it is often required

that a Legal Attache be proficient in the language of the foreign country

involved and should have some familiarity with the culture, customs and

judicial processes. Simultaneously, it is obviously advantageous to have

a thorough knowledge of FBI jurisdiction, regulations, and policies. This

knowledge can only be achieved through years of experience as an FBI

Agent.

In order to maintain the cooperation of foreign agencies, Legal

Attaches assist these agencies by having investigations conducted in the

United States concerning matters of interest to the foreign countries

involved.

Several options in lieu of maintaining FBI Agents in foreign

countries have been suggested. These include the assignment of Embassy

personnel to handle FBI work, to have FBI interests abroad handled by

other law enforcement agencies which maintain foreign liaison offices,

HH 55101 DocId: 32989554 Page 41

and the discontinuance of FBI pursuit of foreign ramifications in criminal

and security responsibilities.by FBI personnel and conduct the investigations

through direct communications. All of these alternatives pose serious

problems including security risks, lack of expertise and knowledge of

FBI procedures and policies, etc.

The FBI has found it necessary and, in fact, through experience

it has been demonstrated it is invaluable to have a man stationed abroad

who can insure that prompt and efficient action is taken and that cooperative

relationships are nurtured and protected. Accomplishments attained by

the FBI through the liaison activities of the Legal Attaches with foreign

law enforcement agencies have been numerous, and it is firmly believed

that these successes would not have occurred in the absence of personal

and direct FBI liaison with foreign police agencies.

The FBI currently has Agents stationed in 15 American

diplomatic establishments outside the United States.

TOPIC:

THE FBI AS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY

The proposal to make the FBI an independent agency within

the Executive Branch has been voiced on several occasions in Congress.

Approximately one year ago, two bills were introduced in the Senate to

achieve this aim.

Proponents of this proposal indicate their basis for supporting

this approach is because of their concern to have the FBI free from political

influence. They cite as an argument the fact the Attorney General is almost

always a political appointee of the President whose views generally conform

with his own.

The question arises whether removal of the FBI from the

Department of Justice is the proper means of assuring a justifiable degree

of independence and freedom from undue political pressure. The FBI as

an independent agency would simply mean the Director would no longer

report to the Attorney General but instead would be responsible directly

to the White House.

Opponents of the proposed Senate bills suggest that some danger

does exist in the FBI's reporting to a political appointee, but a far greater

danger may exist if the FBI, performing as an independent agency, became

the arm of a politically motivated Director who was primarily responsible

to the White House.

Richard H. Ross,

• John P. Thomas, and John A. Van Wagenen.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. on Saturday evening,

10/4/75, I received a call from Special Agent Paul V. Daly

of the

Legal Counsel Division. Mr. Daly advised that the

Attorney General (AG) had requested the Bureau immediately

prepare a list of electronic surveillances conducted by the

Bureau from 1/1/70 until 6/30/75. In addition, the AG

requested that the supportive documents underlying these

electronic surveillance requests also be provided him. Both

the list and supportive documents were to be on the desk of

the AG by 9:00 a.m., 10/6/75.

After a series of calls, arrangements were made

with the Files and Communications Division to begin pulling

the necessary files needed to prepare the list and provide

the supportive documents.

At 9:30 a.I., the above-named

Bureau supervisors reported to the Intelligence Division

where they worked steadily, without taking time out for lunch

or dinner until approximately 9:00 p.m., developing the

necessary information and documents responsive to the AG's

request.

Miss Winslow and Miss Dodge, secretaries in the

Intelligence Division, along with Miss Simmons and Mrs. Weldon,

typists in the Intelligence Division, reported for work at

approximately 11:00 a.m. These 4 young ladies worked contin-

uously through the afternoon and well into the evening hours

preparing the necessary communications for the AG. Not only

did they perform in an admirable fashion but they exhibited

an outstanding attitude and suffered considerable physical

exhaustion prior to their departure for the day at approximately

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

10:00 p.m. Without the outstanding performance of these

4 young ladies, it would have been impossible for this

Division to meet the AG's deadline.

It is interesting to note that the Intelligence

Division was successful in meeting the deadline and had

the necessary material available for the AG at 9:00 a.M.,

on the morning of 10/6/75.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. In view of the outstanding manner in which

I. Patricia Simmons, Christine A. Weldon, Gerry L. Winslow

and Mary E. Dodge performed, it is recommended that each

receive a letter of commendation from the Director.

2. That a general letter of commendation be sent

the Assistant Director, Intelligence Division, for the manner

in which Bureau supervisors in the Intelligence Division

performed and that a copy of that general letter be designated

for the personnel files of those Bureau supervisors mentioned

in the first paragraph of this memorandum.

of the Constitution they have sworn to uphold, and leading

rotentlessiy to the loss ui their freedom and neis sovereignty,

they must perforce take the nost effeciive action to restore sane,

constitutional government, or perish as a free and sovereign people.

"A government that aids and abets the enemies of freedom

at home and abroad; recklessly spends the substance of the nation

In the purchase of votes and in the pursuit of a pro-communist

policy; punishes patriots who dare defy the communist enemy they

are trying to shield, while giving positions of power and peli

to those traitors who give aid and confort to this enemy; employs

the power of the press and all other communications media to

deceive the people as to their real alms and objectives; behaves

as though this nation were already but a province of the illegally

joined United Nations; is willing or unable to meet the constant

flow of crises provided by an arrogant enemy, yielding piece by

piece the entire world into their ruthless hands; shows every sign

at having yielded their powers to an unseen, irresponsible and

thoroughly rapacious government within the government; then even

the bread and circuses no longer can hold the people in check.

They must take matters into their own hands and force the traitors

"In such case there are several courses of action open

to the people.

Political organization to vote out the traitors

and vote in the patriots is one.

Pressure by personal appeals;:

petitions, letters and telegrams is another. But the time comes

when the enemy, feering strong and secure enough, shamelessly

ignores these efforts ci the people, and makes ready to replace

constitutional government with socialistic tyranny openly and

quickly.

Then there is yet another course of action left:

organization of a poweríul, armed resistance force to defeat the

aims of the usurpers and bring about a return of constitutional

government.

purpose ot preventing a communistic cakeover ot their beloved

country, with the toal loss of their freedom, cannot fail to

bring into being again that sovereignty which, under our form of

government, is based upon the people.

Government rules by the

consent or

the governed, and, when the governed refuse further to

consent to being betrayed, then beware! Those in government who

have been Zoyal need have ne fear.

But when the day cones that

the people, in the exercise of their constitutional rights and

sovereignty once more take up arms as they did in 1775, then must

the traitors take thighes Fos the wach of a free end

people, & cod rearing people, against atheistic tyrants can be

terrible and swiit.

with the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), who had received

money from the Soviet Union or had other Soviet connections.

(2) King may have been In the posture of submitting speeches

he intended to give to high CPUSA officers in New York City

prior to his making the speeches.

The writers asked me

for any official comment I could make on this matter.

On the basis of the sparse information stated

by the writers, it appears likely that they were referring

to the following two situations which were documented in

our files:

(1) King's principal advisor was the secret

CPUSA member, Stanley David Levison, who lived and had

business connections in the New York-New Jersey area and

who was deeply involved in the funds operations of

the CPUSA,

including funds from the Soviet Union.

(2) King received

SUBJECT:

Attorney Genexal's February 27, 1975 Testimony

regarding FBI Operations

In his February 27, 1975 testimony before. the Edwards •

Committee regarding FBI information-gathering practices, the

Attorney General gave certain assurances, most of which

seem to

be addressed by the FBI guidelines. These include assusances

that:

1. An examination would be made of the practice. of

collecting information on individuals, including Congressmen

(Ir. p. 6) .

2. An attempt would be made to devise a procedure to

screen unsolicited materials to be retained by the FBI, or

to periodically review them to determine whether they should

be setained (Ir. 16-17).

3. Director Kelley and his associates do not maintain

files on specific individuals in their offices which might be

considered "dossiers"

(Ir. 24). Conficmation that this remains

true today might be obtained.

for the rM toure mould a ento minimize the opportunity

5. Director Kelley was directed to report to the Attor-

ney General practices of requests to the FBI which are or may

appear to be improper (IT. 27-23). This direction was repeated

in July, 1975.

The FBI documents inforning the Bureau of this

policy should be obtained.

Instances in which matters con-

cerning actual or apparent impropriety have been reported to

the Attorney General should be listed.

6. Consideration would be given to an Executive Order

to limit the authority in the White House to make requests

directly to the FBI to a few highly placed White House officials

(Ir. 28) .

7: Consideration would be given to the scope and effect

of the Executive Order which requires the FBI to report to the

mission unverified allegations relevant to the character

of government employees (Is. 29).

8. If the guidelines were complete, the Attorney

General would be delighted to announce them (Ir. 35).

9. Consideration would be given to whether a member

of Congress should be

permitted to review FBI files concern-

ing him not compiled in an investigation authorized by statute

and, if he wishes, order the destruction of those files (Ir. 86).

SUBjECT: Attorney General's SSC testimony regaräing the FBI --

Meeting with SSC Staff

• On November 24, 1975 Doug Marvin, Jack Fuller, Mike Shaheen,

Ray Hornblower and I net with John Elliff and Mark Gittenstein

of the SSC staff to discuss tha Attorney General's testimony

regarding the FBI now scheduled for December 10, 1975.

The SSC has already had public testimony concorning th

FBI from its staff and Jim Adans. It plans to have two days

of relevant hearings next week, one on the F3: informant pro-

gram and another on Department of Justice supervision of the

FBI. On the latter subject, the SSC hopes to have as witnesses

i subject, the

former FBI officials Sullivan and Deloach and former Attorneys

General Rogers, Katzenbach and Clark.

During the week of December 1, 1975, the SSC proposes to

hear public testinony from Williams Ruckelshaus, Henry

and Joseph Califano on FBI domestic intelligence activities,

most are on

Petersen,

Clarence Kelley on the impaci certain proposals would have on

the FBI, and the Attorney General on controlling the FBI. The

SSC may also request executive

session testimony from the Altor-

ney General on the FBI's activities relating to foreign intelli-

gence.

Gittenstein and Elliff described 5 areas which the SSC would

like to discuss publicly with the Attorney General. These are:

1. The legal authority for iBI domestic intelligence activities,

including whether President Roosevelt had the authority to

initiate the program and, if so, whether his authorization

was properly construed by the FBI.

2. The breadth of the FBI's domestic intelligence operations,

which included women's liberation groups and Martin Luther

King, and whether the FBI manual or the proposed guidelines

would permit activities directed against such groups today

or in the future. ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

3. Whether "preventive action" is ever appropriate and, if so,

how it should be controlled.

Whether the Depastment, the President or Congress has given

the FBI adequate guidance on what individuals or groups

constitute internal security threats with which it should

be concerned and whether there is regular review by anyone

to reevaluate the current danger presented by an individual

or group previously designated as an internal security threat.

5.

Whether guidance given to the FBI is being followed and how

this can be assured. Related quastions include whether the

IBI can properly investigate itsele, whether the Department

of Justice should have an Inspector

General, and whether GAO

should be involved in regularly auditing FBI.

activities.

In the course of discussion, Elliff and Gittenstein alluded

to several other questions which might be raised.

These include:

I. Should internal security activities be pernitted at all,

can what Elliff called the "Stone Standard" be readopted?

2. The question raised by the Martin Luther King case of what

degree of suspected or actual connection with a foreign

government should be required to trigger surveillance or

investigation of a domestic group?

How should "infiltration"

be defined?

3. How does a domestic intelligence investigation differ from

a criminal investigation and can the differences be justified?

4. Should there be a statute explicitly authorizing and limit-

ing domestic intelligence activities? If so, what should be

authorized?

5.

What happens to information compiled in the course of unlaw

ful surveillances or activities initiated on the basis of

reasonable beliefs which prove to be unfounded?

Elliff asked whether the proposed FBI guidelines could be dis-.

tributed to members of the SSC and used as a basis for discussion

at the hearings.

We indicated we would consider this request.

FROM : Mark L. WolfüLW

DATE: Nov. 25, 1975

SUBJECT:

Questions susgested by FBI testimony of SSC

Staff and Jin Adams

ne

Mike Shaheen's office is preparing a synopsis of the

testimony regarding the FBI presented on November 18 and 19,

1975 by the SSC staff and Jim Adams.

In my view, the staff

testimony suggests several areas of interest to the SSC, listed

below, which may be discussed with the Attorney General when

he testifies.

1. The SSC questions the value of investigation and sur-

veillance of domestic groups believed to be extremist or sub-

versive.

According to its staff, the GAO attempted to evaluate

activities (Ir. 1605).

They found that of 675

reviewed, oniy l6 had been referred for prosecution; resulting

in 4 convictions.

In addition, in only 12 of these coces

the GAO find "that the FBI gained any advance knowledge of

planned activities,

and 51 percent of those cases revealed no

association with objectionable organizations or no illegal

objectionable activities" (Ir. 1605). Thus, the staff concludes

that surveillance of domestic groups has had Little prosecutorial

or intelligence value and questions whether such activicies should

ever be conducted in view of the costs and risk of abuse they

involve.

2.

The SSC staff believes that important FBI documents

were included in the "personal files" of J. Edgar Hoover which

were destroyed after his dean (Ir. 1008). They believe that

Hoover had reviewed the personal files lettered A to C and

transferred

some official documents from these to the OC files.

However, files lettered D through Z were not reviewed in this

manner

and the staff presumes that some official documents were

lost when these files were destroyed. The SSC believes that

the FBI unintentionally gave the Attorney General an incom-

plete report on this matter which suggested that no FBI docu-

ments were destroyed. This report was later transmitted to

• the SSC.

3. Senator Tower believes that attention should be paid

to the use of informants, a form of intormation-gathering which

does not require judicial or Department of Justice approval

(Tr. 1617) •

- 2 .

4. Interest has been expressed in whether the counter-

espionage and internal security functions of the Bureau should

be separated within the FBI or handled by different organiza-

tions to reduce the risk that techniques appropriate to counter-

espionage will be improperly

employed against domestic groups

(Tr. 1636).

5. The 1971 FBI document ending Cointellpro stated that

"In exceptional instances where it is considered counter-

intelligence action is warranted, recommendation should be

submitted to the Bureau under the individual case caption" (Ir.

1651). Thus, it may be asked whether there have been any such

requests since 1971 and, if so, whether any were aprpoved.

6. The SSC staff believes that the history of the "Security

Index"' is an excellent example of the problems of oversight and

relationships between the FBI, the Department and Congress

• (Tr. 1663).

7. In 1973 the FBI asked the Department to seek statu-

tory authorization for domestic intelligence activities and

such authority has not to date been sought (Ir. 1675).

8. The FBI procedure of reporting by an "INLET" letter

items with an unusual twist or concerning prominent individuals

was discontinued because there were better means of communicating

"dirt" to headquarters for dissemination to the White House

(Ir. 1707) .

This raises

the question of whether agents are

still

expected to furnish such information to headquarters

• when it was stopped. If it has not been stopped,

ahat type de information 1s nou forwarded and what is done with

it?

Finally, Alan C. Brownfold, a faculty menkor at the Chivorsily or Maryland

IY, APPROPRIATIONS TESTIMONY

On February 10, 1966, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover testified regarding the

Ku Klux Klan, saying that "the Bureau continues its worram of penetrating

the Klan at all levels and, i may say,

has bean quite successiul in doing so.

The Bureau's role in penerrating the Klan has receired public attention due to

the solution of the brutal murders of Viola Luizzo in Alabama,

Colonel Lemuel A. Penn in Georgia and the three civil sights workers in Mis-

sissippi. We have achieved a number of other tangible accomplishments in ihis

field, most of which are not publicly knowu but are most signiticant." Discussion

oft the record followed.

V. PUBLIC SUPPONT OF TILE CUCNTERINTELTIGENCE PROGRAM

Folloning acknowledgement that the FBI had a connierintelligence program,

syndicated columnist Tictor Kiesel wrote on June 15, 1973,

"no apologies are due

from those in the hichest authority for secretly developing a domesic counter-

revolutionary intellicence stratarom in carly 1970." Mr. Hiesel derailer the record

of "dead students," ' university libraries la flames," and "insensate murdering or

cops," and concluded "it would have been wrone not to nave are satra to contier

On June 1S, 1074. Eugeno al. Mothrin, Sonior Eritor. "The Reader's Digest,"

testifed before the House Committre on Forcion Affairs regrading terrorism and

noted, ".

SENATE SELECI COMMITIEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR THOMAS E. BISHOP

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

NOTE:

Mr. Bishop's report of the interview was set

out in his personal letter of 12/4/75 to Supervisor Seymor

Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project. Mr. Bishop asked

that the letter be carefully edited. This was done to

omit those portions which were irrelevant to the interview

no were personal comments to Mr. Phillips. In those

instances where it was unclear as to whether Mr. Bishop

was reporting what he said during the interview nr was

merely commenting parenthetically, the portions were also

omitted. Legal Counsel memnrandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

11/28/75 captioned "Senstudy 75" prepared by PVD:dkg

recommended releasing Bishop from any existing employment

agreements for purposes of the SSC interview.

In his letter to Mr. Phillips, Mr. Bishop, under

that portion, captioned "The Ehrlichman Teletype," also

wrote,",. this was the matter in which Pat Gray tried

to shaft me by telling the newspapers that the handling of

this matter had been done by me without authority, without

the approval of my superiors.

The truth of the matter was

that I had objected to Mark Felt that the Bureau shouldn't

even handle this, I had been specifically ordered to initiate

action on it by felt and that Felt, David Kinley and

Pat Gray had all approved the handling of it. Of course,

when 'Life' Magazine printed a critical story about it,

then Gray started to get scared and tried to dump the blame

on me. I challenged him on it quite vigorously and, in fact,

this was the thing that finally made me realize that I

should retire from the Bureau because Gray was playing

politics and using the Bureau to do so."

San Diego, Cal.

December 4, 1975

Mr. Seymour Phillips

FBI

Washington, DO

Dear Seymour:

In accordance with your request, I am going to try

to set down - very briefly -- some of the items dealt with during

my appearance before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

the Sonato

Avtivities on December 2, 1975. I am a very poor typist and can't

possibly remember all the

have to bear with me.

First of all, I Mas sworn in by sen. Schweiker, who

only stayod for a very briel time. I was interviened froa 9AM

to a bout 5 PM, with Gordon Rhea, Assistant to the Chiel Cannsel,

Frederick Baron, Assistant to the Chief Counsel, and Barbara

Banoff, Counsel, present suring the entire questioning, and with

Joseph diGenona, Counsel, participating during the morning session,

and John ElifI, Head of the Domestic Task Force, participating

in the afternoon.

Let me say at the outset that it was a protty grueling

experience, not because I couldn't handle the questions they

throw at me, but because of the sheer length of the session and

because I had absolutely no prior knowledge of what memos, docu-

ments, ete they were to throw at me. I do think that the Bureau does

a disservice to former employees who have been out of the Bureau

for some time and who have to appear before the Commityee, by not

giving them some idea of the areas of questioning that will be fand

no da 230

Laced with and some clues as to what old memos, ate thay will be

called upon to explain.

Now, gotting back to my questioning - they first

wanted me to give them a detailed account of just what duties the

Grime Records Division performed. This included every lunction

performed by the front office, as well as each and every thing that

each of the sctions dud did. They were particularly interested

In the handling of press matters -- whether we played any favorites

among papers in giving out news stories, exactly what type of in-

formation we gave out to the press, etc. Naturally, I told them

we playod no favoritos but that I naturally knew personally what

papers and reportes were favorably disposed toward the Bureau and

which were prejudiced against us and that this was in my mind

in dealing with the pross. I stressed to them that we always

strictly followed the ATtorney General's Guidelines on what

could and could not be given to the news media on criminal cases

and that only information of a strictly public source naturo was

over given to any newsman in other types of cases. I carefully

explained to them what public source data is and diffarentiated

techniques.

I also stressed to them that we never withheld

Irom any newspaper, reporter, radio or TV network any info

which they had a right to know about no matter how antagonistic

or anti-FBI the paper, IV or radio ntework ar the reporter

might be.

Now getting to some of the topics which they went into

in depth.

MASS MEDIA PROGRAM

The showed me dozens of memos prepared by the Dom. Intell.

Div, under this program, all of which recommended that the Crime

Records Div. give into to tas selected newspapors or publications

which info reflected unfavorably on certain individuals or

organizations. Many of these memos related to M.I. King, other

racial leaders

they didn't think much of this program and thought of it as

harrassment. Theu wanted me to justify each of the memos. I pointod

out to them that they dad not originate in the Crime Records

Div. and that I therefare did not think that it was up to me to

justily them. I pointed out the the role of the Crime Reoords Div

was to merely serve as a conduit to get the infonation prepared

by the Dom Intell Dit to the reporter, that the Infonation

to be passed by us to a reporter was compiled by the Dom Intell

Div and that the approval of the action proposed by the memos

was in most sases complotod before the memo even camo to us. I

also pointed out that, in each of the memos thaey showed me, the

Information to be passed to the press was of a strictly public

source nature, and that none of the information could be considered

confidential

_CONINTELPRO

They showed me a lot of memos prepared by the Dom Intel

Div under this program which also recommended giving certain info

to certain reporters abour selected individuals and groups. I told

then that, as far as the Crime Records Div was concerned, these

were handled the same as those under the Mass Media Program and

that all of my replies and explanations ubder that caption (above)

also applied to this program.

DO NOT CONZACT LIST

They wantod to know all about the handling of this.

I told them, and also explained there was nothing sinister about

it and that it was merely to keep our agents from wasting their

time contacting people during investigations who had clearly

indicated that they did not wish to be contacted, and also to keep

our agents Irom being insulted or vilified repeatedly by people f

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENTS LIST

I had to explain this in detail - its purpose, how a

person got included on the list, hun what publications, ete, were

sent to people on the list, etc. It appeared my explanations satis-

fied them.

WHITE HOUSE NAME CHECKS

This was gone into pretty thondaghly. In answer to a

question, I told them that we generally knew from the list of names

on which checks were being asked what was the reason for the name

check request (because the list whold generally indicate a date on

which a function was being hold at the White Housw to whieh the e

people on the list had been invited; I told them, however, that we

would still handle the name

check even turk though we did not

know why it was requested. They tried to make something out of that

but gave up after I pointed out how ridiculous it would be lf the

FBIrefused to give the President a summary of data in a our files

on a person unless he first told us why he wanted it.

CONGRESSIONAL FILES

I had to give them a detailed explation of this -- what

Info we collected from the field offices on newly elected Con-

gressmen and senators, what we did with the info, what we used it

for, otc. I frankly thought that they would go into this in even

more detail than they did. They seemed to back off from it when

I explained that the chief purpose of the Congressional Files was

to assist me in handling liaison with the Senate and House-: that

I wanted to know which Congressmen and Senators were crooks, lushes,

libertines, etc because I certainly wouldn't trust anyone like

that. I said I could give them some specitio, horrible ozamples,

1233

but they didn't want me to put the names an

the record.

LEONARD BOUDIN

He was the attorney for dr, spock during the latter's

trial. He has a long history of CP'associationg • During the trial

a memo was written setting out all the public source data known

on him and It was recommended that it be given to a friendly news-

In fact given to a newsman at that time, and if we made a

practice of giving out derogatory data on attorneys for defendants

in Bureau cases. I told them we must have been askod for public

showed them nosations written on the mamo which specifically

prohibited tha data beibg given out while the trial was in progres

or even until alter all appeals in the spock case were concluded.

THE ERLICHMAN TELELYPE

While I was being interviewed, the Administrative Assistant

to Sen. Phillip Hart, called the staff and asked that I be

detailed statement on the record. concerning the

above matter. I was delighted to dos so because trata,/ this was

the matter in which Pat Gray tried to shaft me by telling the

newspapers that the hanaling of this matter had been done by mo

without authority, without the approval of my superiors. The

truth of the metter wast that I had objected to Mark Felt that

the Bureau shouldn't even handle this, I had been specifically

ordered to initiate action on it by Felt, and that Felt, David Ex

Kinley and Pat Gray had all appoured the handling of 1t. 0f

course, when 'Ilfe' Magazine printed a critical story about it, then

Gray started to got scared and tried to dump the blame on me. I

challenged him on It quite vigorously and, in fact, this was the

thing that finally made me realize that I should retife from

the Bureau because Gray was playing politics and using the Bureau

to do so. Anyway, I put on the record a deatiled explanation

of the habdling of this matter and clearly placed the respon-

sibility for it where it belonged. The reason Sea Hart wanted to

get my

side of it on the record is because Gray, during his con-

firmation hearing, had triod to slip and dodge questions about

this and Sen Haft thought he may have come close to perjury.

BOS ANGELES TIMES AND JACK NELSON

I was questioned in great detail concerning the Bureau's

relations with the above paper and with Jack Nelson, one of 1t's

I if you teed to pons out

Washington based reporters who for some time had been carrying on

a vendette against.Mr. Hoover and who, on several occasions had

claimed he was out to # "get" Mr. Hoover. In 1971 or 1972 the

General Manager of the LA Times came to see Mr. Hooverk and,

before he went in , the Crime Records Division prepared a

detailed memo on our relations with the TIMES and on what we

had in our files on Nolsón.

The staff was in possession of

this memo and questioned me intensively about it. I explained why

it was prepared, that it was for interhal use only( I emphasized

this because the staff seemed to think we had planned to give it

to someone outside the Bureau), and explained the whole background.

of the situation. In doing so, I must admit, I took advantage of

the situation to get on the record several times my description

of Nelson as a "drunken s.o.B."

towA

Dal -2

Well, Seymour, that's about as much as I can recall. &

Besides, my wife is waiting for me to play golg with her. As I

said, It was a long session. I did not, however, on any occasion

ever

admit that anything that was done by me, Mr. Hoover or the

Bureau was wrong or improper, even with 20/20 hindsight. I only

wish that some of the Bureau people who has testified would have

expressed themselves the same way

Reference is made to SSC letter dated Novenber 7,

197S, requesting a monorandun on this Bureau's operation of

infornants in the internal secuxity fleld.

An informant, according to the dictionary, is

"one who gives infornation." In ligut os this definition,

it is clear that very lew persons, it aby, have not at one

time or another been informants.

To give information is an

Inseparable part of life. To give accurate, sound and

helpful infornation for a worthy cause is to make one's

Ille more usejul and valuable to society.

Informants of the FBI are persons who furnisa

nocessary and vital iniormation-intornation which is used

as a means of attaining justice. Infordants cler the

innocent as well as convict the quilty. They serve of their

own free will.

None are forced.

Informants are as old as

the hunan race.

Their use 1s international. History is

studded with wany and varied examplos of the uses of intormants.

No governent or organized society has been without thei.

Informants provide one oi the best and most complete

forms of coverage to the law enforcement officer. Sonetimes

they are the only means of penetrating subversive or extrenist

organizations.

Informants are valuable because they obtain

intornation more directly and thus save time and money;

they are useful in checking on the accuracy of intormation Ew/fl

from other informants and have been used to help develop

other informants; they give a better understanding of the

motives, objectives and intentions of subjects which allows

Law enforcement to plan its investigative operations; they

prevent or minimize danage to property and injury to

• Law

enforcement officers and innocent persons; they further the

development of independent evidence to corroborate intorianta

costiuony or alleviato the need for inforuants" testicony

OPERATIONE PITH RESPICI TO INTILLIGENCE ACIIVITIES (SSC)

The developuent of infornants is one of the most

difficult, unique and specialized assignments.

Despite

the obstacies encountered in informant development, Bureau

Agents have net and are continuing to meet with steady and

remarkable successes. They regularly denonstrate vision,

daring and commendable resourcefulness in this work.

Bureau today we believe has the best informant coverage in

its history.

When information is receivod

or developed that a

person has background qualiiications indicativo of Informant

other logical discreet checks are made, including canvass of

background, reliability, stability and integrity. It the

prelininary checks are favorable, the individual

would be

to establish a personal assessnent by a

Special Agent as to the person's qualifications, potential,

and willingness to assist this Bureau.

If the interview is

positive,

additional background investigation is conducted

to establish the persons reliability, stability, and

integrity.

Upon satisfaccory completion of this

investication,

stability and productiveness, becones a leadquarters approved

informant.

The Bureau's Informants, particularly in the internal

security tield, have many restrictions imposod upon their

relationship with the bureau. For example, they are inpressed

with the confidential nature of their relationship with the

FBI, that their actions are strictly voluntaxy and that they

are not employees. If they are connected in any way with a

Labor union, they are informed that the Bureau is not

interested in an employee-employer relationship or i1

connected with an institution of learning, they are specifically

advised that the sureau is not interested in the legitimate

activities of educational institutions.

In particulax, all

Informants are instructed to avoid knowleêge of defense plano

and strategy of discussion thereos with attorneys, subjecte

or other individuals in any prosecution arising fron intelligence

or criminal investigations In the event an informant is

unable to avoid obtaining such inforuation, this information

a Legal Officer avnilable for training, consultation and

guidance,

Frequent, extensive In-service retralning

programs

further bolster the special Agents' knowledge and

utilization of the law in the conduct of their orlicial

dutios. Specifically, Informant development and handling

are extensively discussed in the FBI's training prograns

and there is no question as to Special Agents being aware

that iniormants cannot be directed to perform a function

that the Special Agent may not legally perforn. Special

Agents are particularly reminded of the need to be alert

to plants, potential agent provocateurs to be used gainst

law enforcement in a variety of ways, so as to avoid

unfounded allegations of impropriety which may jeopardize

Investigations or prosecutions as well as result in highly

publicized contrived incidents reflecting adversely on

law enforcement.

Hany of our informants furnish needed and valuable

intormation on a sratuitous basis. Many are also paid for

theit services.

Payments to informants are one of the most

highly supervised areas within Bureau operations, When

a paymont is made to an informant, the handling Agent must

make a realistie deteruination ab

to the value of theservices

performed by the informant. Established Bureau procedure

requires that paynents made to informants, upon recommendation

of handling Agent and approval of appropriate supervisory

personnel, originate fron the office Field support Account

and are drawn from this account by check made out to the

handling Agent for the anount authorized.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVENNMENTAL

OZERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGINCE ACTIVIIIES (SSC)

Concerning varrants, a warrant requiranent for

the use of informants appears

impractical and aay be

unconstitutional. It is impractical because probable cause

usually is not available when the informant technique is

initiated and the submission oi an aîfidavit in application

for a warrant would increase the hazard of exposure of the

informant's identity. Such a Imitation night be unconstitutional

because it would linit the First Amendnent rights of the

Informant to connunicate with the Government.

Existing legal

restrictions require guidod informants to recognize the sane

legal limitations as would be applicable, in the sane circum

stances, to those directing the infommants.

An informant can

legally do no nore than an Agent is pernicted to do.

The Burenu in the domestic intelligence area has under

investigation organizations, most of wich have nuerous districis,

regions, offices, sections, chapters and clubs.

These orsaniza

tions and their subdivisions total over 1100, which receive

investigative attention to some extent. These investigations

are afforded coverage by less than 1100 internal security

Intornants.

It nust be recognized, however, that there are

other individuals who aro in various stoges oi development in

this fleld. Concerning payments, one-half of one percont (.54)

of the Bureau's budget (fiscal 1975) was utilized to pay nil

types of security inforuants including those in the foreign

counterintelligence 11eld.

As noted, the bureau's utilization of informante

involves a high degree of care and supervision. li is a

specific Bureau policy that an informnt nay only be

trngeted against individuals or organientions of

apprehended. Additionally the FBI located 442 persons

and other federal agencies located 21 individuals.

Local and state law enforcoment authorities located 94

persons.

During the same time frane, internal security

informants provided information which led directly to

the recovery of property valued at approximatoly one half

million dollars. It must be turther recognized that a

warrant requirement for use of informants would virtually

eliminate access of law enforcenent to this collateral

infornation resulting in many crimes going unsolved or

not prevented.

The FBI believes the elements of close

supervision, restraint, latitude and judguent are

essential in an infornant progran and it is further

belleved that the proper balance of these elements is

being utilized by the FBI successfully in the operation

of informants in the security field.

ATTACHMENT NO. 2

..

3. Illegal Activities

Illegal activities on the part of any employee, in addition to being

unlawiul, reflect on the integrity of the FBI and betray the trust and

confidence placed in it by the American people.

Furthermore, unlawful

activities can disqualify

him for employment by the Government of the

United States.

It is, therefore, expected tha: employees will obey not only

the letter of the law but the spirit of the law as well whether they be

engaged in transactions of a personal or official nature. With respect to

investigative activities, this admonition particularly applies to entrap-

ment of the use of any other improper, illegal, or unethical tactics in the

procurement of evidence. In this regard: it should be especially noted that,

in securing information concerning mail matter, the Bureau will not

tolerate a violation of law (Title 18, USC, 88 1702, 1703, 1708, and 1709)•

Furthermore, employees must not tamper with, interfere with, or open mail

in violation of law nor aid, abet or condone the opening of

mail illegally

by any employee of the U. S. Postal Service.

As members of a Federal investigative agency, FBI employees must at all

times zealously guard and defend the rights

and liberties guaranteed to

al1 individuals by the Constitution. Therefore; FBI employees must not

engage in anv investigative activity which could

abridge in any way the

rights guaranteed to a citizen of the United States by the Constitution

and under no circumstances shall employees of the FBI engage in any con-

reputation, integrity,

du dignity many catizen of manization a eat zen at the interstates.

Employees must not install secret telephone systems or microphones without

Bureau authority.

No brutality, physical violence, duress or intimidation of individuals by

our employees will be countenanced nor will force be used greater than

that necessary to effect arrest or for self-defense.

At the time of the last inspection in January,

-1971, the Internal Security Section handled informants

-only in the basic revolutionary organizations and related

groups.

There was no Security Informant Unit as such,

informants being handled on subversive organization

desks.

On June 16, 1971, a Security Informant Unit was

formed and this Unit now

handles informants in the

New Left field as well as in basic revolutionary

organizations and related groups.

At last inspection there were (264) member informants

EXTREMIST INFORMANTS

4-H

The prime purpose of development and utilization

of extremist informants and sources is to provide intelligence

and evidenciary information concerning black and white

extremist organizations and individuals. These sources are

also called upon to furnish information concerning situations

affecting civil unrest in all parts of the country.

Supervision of extremist informants at the Seat of

Government includes review and approval of new informants

and confidential sources, review of progress of informants,

review of payments being made to informants, analysis of

informant coverage in each field office, analysis of nation-

wide informant coverage of the various extremist organizations,

coordination of informant coverage of specific functions such

as Black Panther Party (BPP) and other extremist groups:

conventions, supervision of operations for the development of

top-echelon BPP informants, and other special projects such as

development of information concerning black extremist under-

ground escape routes and coordinating utilization of informants

abroad with other agencies. All procedures are constantly

evaluated, in an effort to increase the efficiency of our

operation and to provide the field with the necessary supervision

with a minimum of paper work.

As of 7/31/71 we are operating a total of 7,477

extremist informants compared with a total of 7,184 at the

time of the last Inspection. This is an increase of 293

informants. Concerning the above informants, 583 informants

report on black extremist organizations and 353 informants

report on white extremist organizations such as the Klan:

We

are operating (6,541) ghetto informants who provide general

information within the black ghetto areas of our cities as

compared to 6,224)ghetto informants at the time of the last

Inspection which represents an increase of (317)ghetto informants.
