On 4-15-64 Inspector Malley receited a call from J. Lee Rankin:

in New York City. It will be noted that on 4-17-64 the Commission

contemplates interrogating functionaries of the Communist Party (CP) in

New York concerning their knowledge of Oswald. U

Mr. Rankin made reference to the report of Special Agent

Thomas P. Estep dated 12-18-63 at Cincinnati, Ohio.

Mr. Rankin noted

that the report referred to a meeting which occurred at Wheeling,

Nest Virginia,

on 12-8-63.

Mr. Rankin noted that the report was

"Confidential" and he wanted to know if, in talking to CP people, it

would be satisfactory for him to ask questions concerning the details

of the meeting without interfering with any of our operations. u

The report in question contains information furnished by

Confidential Informant(CI 104-S who advised that Arnold Johnson of C

New York City, public relations man for the CP, gave a talk dealing

with the assassination of President Kennedy. The information, while

helpful, does not add anything of particular significance to the Oswald

investigation and

is generally self-serving to the CP. U

On 4-15-64 SAC Mason advised that at the particular meeting

there were six other CP members present with Mr. Johnson.

Three of

were

symbol number informants of the Cincinnati Office.

SAC Mason advised

that these

particular informants cover an area in West Virginia and

Ohio where there is CP activity and, hence, these informants are valuable

to the coverage of the CP establishment not only by the Cincinnati Cifice

but by our Cleveland and Pittsburgh Offices.

Furthermore, according

to SAC Mason, the particular informant who reported the meeting;

CI 104-S,

is the only informant who is qualified to attend the State Board

meetings of the Ohio Clathey

Mr:

Mason noted that if Johnson is questioned

concerning this meeting

will obviously check for a source

and this

could uncover one or all of

the

informants involved thereby seriously

jeopardizing our coverage
