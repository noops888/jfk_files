OSTICCO stated that he and DOMINIC ALAIMO are close

personal friends and

were raised together

in Pittston, Pa.

for one or more of his, OSTICCO's, children.

ANGELO JOSEPH SCIANDRA was interviewed by SAs HOULI-

HAN and BOYLAN on July 1, 1958, and advised that he has known

DOMINIE AbALMO all his life, but has never actually been in

business with him, nor did he recall ever having ALAIMO on his

pay roll at Ann-Lee.

When Interviewed on July 1, 1958, by SAs HOULIHAN and

BOYLAN, 1t should be noted SCIANDRA claimed

that he did not see

ALAIMO at Apalachin, N. X., on November 14, 1957.

In March 1958, PH T-2 advised that ALAIMO, ANGELO

SCIANDRA, and DAVE OstIeCe traveled to New York together in

January 1950.

On May 14, 1958, PH I-3 advised SA FREDERICK I.

HOULIHAN that he had last

seen OSTICCO with DOMINIC ALAIMO

during the time that the dress strike was in progress.

At

that time, OSTICCO did not want ALAIMO to sign with the union

and he told him to hold out and sign as one of a group and

not individually.

During this strike, OSTICCO took part in

a meeting held at the Gramercy Restaurant, Pittston, Pa., at

which were present RUSSELL BUFALINO, DOMINIC ALAIMO, and

MAX

STEIN.

At this meeting, BUFALINO asked that Jane Hogan not

Join in the signing of an individual contract with the Inter-

national Ladies! Garment Workers Union and that if an

agreement was reached it should be done as a group.

The In-

formant was of the opinion that BUFALINO wanted Jane Hogan

to remain as part of the Pennsylvania Garment Manufacturers

Association and sign with the union only if Pennsylvania Gar

ment Manufacturers Association signed.

On June 4, 1958, PH T-3 advised SA HOULIHAN that

he had obsered no current association of ALAIMO With DAVE

OSTICCO, RUSSELL BUFALINO, and ANGELO SCIANDRA; however, he

stated he believed ALAIMO

still assoclates with these indivi

duals.
