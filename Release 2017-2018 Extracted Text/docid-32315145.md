he told unman not to testify (to knowing MAGADDINO?) • MAGADDINO

retorted that they only asked about him because of

POPS"

(JOHN PAPALIA or one of the PAPALIA brothers) and

1 "that

other guy" (ALBERT AGUECI?), and the "other things in New York."

MAGADDINO then began to discourse as to how this

unman could testify by claiming inability to remember or

recall, and by claiming to have met numerous people.

then asked when the investigation is to start, but the answer

was not learned by the informant. The conversation then

brought out the name of a newspaperman named (FNU) COLLINS,

CARLS or CORLINS (PH) whom all present derided as being

"bossy" and a

• "pig.

MAGADDINO then reverted to the possible testimony

of unman who, according to MAGADDINO, could admit knowing

MAGADDINO, but only casually and nothing of a derogatory

nature.

Later, when MAGADDINO commented that he was proud

of the "family"

he had raised, RANDACCIO asked in an

apparently facetious manner which "family.

MAGADDINO

expressed disapproval of RANDACCIO's comment, RANDACCIO

quickly added that MAGADDINO had done a good

job with

both families."

MAGADDINO then related that his niece,

age 55, who lives on Devoe Street (Brooklyn, New York),

had been interviewed by the FBI regarding him.

It was not clear to the informant from the above

information whether PETE BROCIOTA and the unman who is

apparently in the process of being subpoenaed to testify

before a Canadian Inquiry Board are identical.

on 5/20/64, fisurs by Bureau Agents in Buffalo

Restaurant in Crystal Beach, Ontario, Canada, a small resort

near Buffalo. He stated that NASCA had become involvec

with Canadian Customs authorities due to smuggling merchandise

into Canada in small quantities over a period of time and

CI was not aware of the disposition

of this matter, but stated that NASCA was in extremely poor

financial straits due to high attorney's fees.

"The Chief"

is believed to be identical to a Canadian gambler in the

Et. Erie, Ontario area and Buffalo sources are being con-

tacted to fully identify him.

Records of the Toronto, Canada Telephone Company

showed on 5/21/64, that telephone number RO 9-2512 was

originally issued to G. TARANTULA of 95 Ashburnham, Toronto.

This same number was transferred to TARANTULA's current

address of 64 Cordella Street, Toronto, on 4/28/64. The

current

toronto City Directory lists a GUISEPPI TARANIA,

a bricklayer, as residing at 64 Cordella Street. There

is no record for TARANTULA or TARANTA in the records of

the Metropolitan Toronto Police Department (MTPD) or the

indices of the Buffalo Office.

Information developed to

date indicates that "DON SIMONE" mentioned by CI is possibly

DOMINICK SIMONE, a well-known Toronto hoodlum and associate

Of JOHN PAPALIA.

With reference to the JOSEPH FALCONE mentioned

by RANDACCIO, it should be noted that BU 280-c* tentatively

identified a visitor of STEVE MAGADDINO in the morning and

afternoon of 5/19/64 as JOSEPH FALCONE Of Utica, New York.

The Albany Office was telephonically contacted on 5/20/64,

to ascertain, if possibly, the whereabouts of FALCONE on

5/19/04, and to determine if he is by chance known to be

in the Buffalo or nearby Canadian areas.

On 5/21/64, the

Albany Office telephonically advised that FALCONE had been

observed at his residence in Utica between 2:00 and 3:00

p.m. on 5/19/64.

The information furnished by CI in this matter

is being disseminated to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police

(RCMP), Toronto, on a confidential basis and with due care

given to protecting the source.
