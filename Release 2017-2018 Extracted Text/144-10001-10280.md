CUBA

1.

The alert in Oriente province, apparently prompted by the

assassination of President KENNEDY, is believed to have

terminated on 25 November (2027.1). Access to the coastal

observation post at Punta Maisi was restricted only until :25

November, and Eastern Naval District units, which were to receive

further instructions regarding the alert on 25 November, have

apparently not received any such orders. Further, the Cuban navy

held an island wide communication exercise on 25 November.

Such

an exercise is unlikely under alert conditions. 12/01 R58-63,

260219Z)

B-1 Comment: It is possible that the restriction regarding access

to the Punta Maisi observation post extended to other observation

posts in Oriente as well, and that the restriction was to be lifted

on 25 November by all of

these posts.
