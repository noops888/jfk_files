dated 4/12 and 5/31/62; Newark report of SA MAURICE T.

BOWMAN dated 12/29/61; and New York letter to Bureau 6/4/62.

Referenced Newark report set forth information

concerning a past successful fund-raising effort by MENOYO

1961, with the assistance of members of the Liceo Cubano

JOSe

Marti, a Cuban social club in Union City.

on 5/22/62, PSI DIONISIO FELINO 'RODRIGUEZ,

union City; N.J., advised SA MAURICE T. BOWMAN that

he knew of

no organized group or member in the Second National Front of

Escambray existing in Union City or Newark, N.J.

No large

collections such as that made in September, 1961, were

known to have recently taken place in New Jersey.

members of the Liceo Cubano, who participated in the prior

fund drive; were described as belonging to various other

anti-CASTRO groups but to have been willing to cooperate

with MENOYO because of their faith in his alleged plans to

sponsor guerrilla activity in Cuba. PSI advised, however,

that there was one individual by the name of SILBERIO

RODRIGUEZ,

whose employment and address were unknown,

who was said to have occasionally solicited money ati

around March, 1962e

No receipts would be issued by

RODRIGUEZ, who indicated to the contributors that their

names were being made a matter of record.

Source knew of

no other individuals soliciting

funds in New Jersey for

MENOYO, FLEITES or their group.
