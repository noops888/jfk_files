SUBJECT

SPECIMC Field Iraces on Subjecte of HRS-W-1326 NR.

Reference: HRS-H-1326 of 3 September 1957

INFO: Chiefs of Stations, Sen Jose

and Habana

1. The files of all appropriate Panana and Canal Zone agencies Here re-

viewed for information concerning the Subjects of reference, as

requested therein. The only ageney with information on Subjecte wäs

HIAFFIX, and a verifax copy of that organization's file is forwarded

as a separate cover attachment to this dispatch for the information of

KUSODA. Information available in Stetion files was solely that con-

tained In Information copios of HYAFFIX reports. Station realizes

that the information contained in paragraph 2 of reference was undoubt-

edly based on these sane HYAFFIX reports and therefore does not

necessarily constitute confirmation. As will be noted, Subjects have

- not been a matter of record in files of any local agencies since

May 1945.

2. In view of the elapsed time since Subjects were employed in Panama,

current investigation was not deemed feasible.

3. Headquarters may provide Stations San Jose and Habana with copies of

the separate cover HYAFFIX filo at its discretion.
