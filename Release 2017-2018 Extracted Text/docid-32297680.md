CONFIPENTIAL

WITNESS

DESCRIPTION

on October 21, 1952 to serve

five years for Grand Larceny:

Mr. P. C. CROSBY

agent for

the Northern Pacific Railroad,

Hamburg, Arkansas, advised

on March 16, 1956 that he

knew SHAW for about eight

years from 1938-1945 and stated

that SHAW drank to excess,

that he was a person of no

responsibility,

and he would

not recommend him for a

position of responsibility.

He further stated that SHAW

had written bad checks all

his life, and when he made

any money, he would write a

check in a

surrounding town

and use the money to buy

whiskey.

CROSBY stated that

sometime in the early 1930's

SHAW got in a knife fight with

another Negro in Hamburg:

Arkansas and was placed ir

jail. CROSBY stated that it

was to his recollection that

the injured Negro died about

a year after the knifing,

however, ne ald not believe

that SHAW was charged with

the death of the other man.

Records of the Hamburg, Arkan-

sas Police Department failed

to reflect any record that

SHAW had been in jail in

Hamburg?

Arkansas, however,

Mr. WILLIAM HADEN, Chief of

Police at Hamburg, Arkansas,

advised March 16,

1956 that

he remembered SHAW had been

in a fight and had seriously

wounded another man in Hamburg

in the 1930°s.

SHAW stated

that he is willing to testify

to the information that he

furnished to the FBI.
