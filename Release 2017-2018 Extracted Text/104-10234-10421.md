CASTRO, his brother, RAULiCASTRO, lead of the Armed

Forces,

and Commandante ERNESTO "CIE" ¡GUEVARA.

MIRO

explained that he

waS

""sucked in" by communist ideology

because the Cubans desired

, the invasion of Panama in their own way.

As a result,

he

was summoned to the office. of RAUL.

CASTRO and made to stay in that vicinity until the

Invaders bad departed Cuba.

DAVIDSON recalled that this

had taken place in April of 1959. °

called Panama

imminent Invasion.

.to

Invade Panama in January, 1960.

armament to outfit 250 men for the invasion.

DAVIDSON

advised that he had a list of this equipment but could

not locate it at that particular moment, but when it vas

DAVIDSON

250 -30

concerning the invasion.

officials.

He subsequently told MIRO that he would
