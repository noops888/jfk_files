CG 9561-PCI, on 6/12/72, advised that some years

ago the Chicago outfit headed by LENNIE PATRICK, JACKIE

CERONE, and others, muscled their way into the Black Angus

Restaurant, Chicago.

This place became a meeting spot for

Chicago hoodlums.

It was operated by BEN EPSTEIN, who died,

and the operation later was taken over by IRV SINGER.

DAVE YARAS became involved shortly following the outfit's

taking over the Black Angus. YARAS spent much time in Miami

On 7/19/72, informant advised that Black Angus

had been sold to one

CHRIS CARSON, associated with the

Millionaires Club, and that allegedly YARAS, with LENNIE

PATRICK, had something to do with the deal.

Reportedly,

BEN EPSTEIN, who formerly had an interest in the Black

Ingus, was eased out by PATRICK and YARAS who took out of

he place a considerable amount of money. This was manage

somehow through manipulation of the liquor bills for the

restaurant.

when they had a meeting to consider and discuss this glass

and individuals who were introduced as DAVID YARAS and his

son, LENNIE. Informant stated that he understood that YARAS

is an outfit-connected individual and that he is closely

associated with two "juice" men who ran a laundry on the

north side of Chicago. According to the source, YARAS made

a comment to the effect that an investment by his associates

would be an excellent "tax shelter."
