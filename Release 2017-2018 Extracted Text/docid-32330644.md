Re Dallas report of SA IVAN D. LEE, 12/17/64.

Enclosed for the Bureau are five copies of a

letterhead memorandum setting forth information concerning

limited his activities and contacts and according to informants

he can be found almost every evening at one of the Redman Clubs

Club Montmarte where he is engaged in low-stake card

games.

The Dallas Division has not received any

information from sources or informants to indicate that

MATTHEWS is presently traveling or associating with police

characters other than the gamblers found at the above clubs.

As mentioned in letterhead memorandum, the following

sources or informants of the Dallas Division are regularly
