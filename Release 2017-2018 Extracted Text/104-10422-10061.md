MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

VIA

FROM

: Deputy Director for Operations

: Lawrence M. Sternfield

Acting Chief, Counterintelligence Staff

SUBJECT

: Ruby-Oswald Conspiracy

1.

The Evening Star of 9 July 1976 carried an inside

article

ex=itled "Ruby Met With Castro, Sturgis Says".

The

Five parag-aph article made the following points:

* Watergate burglar Sturgis says Ruby met

Castrs and discussed "removal" of Kennedy ten weeks

before the assassination.

B..

Sturgis passed above information to US

Govertment agencies in early 1964.

C.

Sturgis' investigation of Cuban exile involve-

ment

assassination was negative.

d.

Sturgis refused to identify agency for which

employeed, but is known to have worked for CIA.

E.

Sturgis said his investigation produced evi-

dence -nat Oswald and Ruby were involved in the same

conspiracy along with other people.

3. The

following comments re Sturgis' remarks are based

Agency records:

A.

With regard to the report that Sturgis was

mploye=: by the Agency the report of the Rockefeller

=ommiss =Ion on page 252 says that Sturgis testified

evidence of such employment in any form.

soport of a visit by Ruby to Cuba in late 1962-early

1963 had been received from Havana. This same report

received press distribution and was widely known

in the Cuban exile community in Miami.

C. There was no confirmatory information for

that report either before or since it was made.

D. In considering the matter of Agency diligence

and thoroughness in investigating the assassination

of President Kennedy, the main point is that the in-

formation was reported.

E. There is no record in the Agency that this

information was reported to the Warren Commission

OR

by the Agency of the Bureau. In fact National Archives

state that the Warren Commission records do not contain

the information.

F. On the same point it is noted that in a memo

to the Warren Commission on 15 September 1964 the DDP

Mr. Karamesines said, "The Agency has no indication

that Ruby and Oswald. . . might have been connected in

any manner. "
