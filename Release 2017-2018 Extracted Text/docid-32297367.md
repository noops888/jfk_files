since PETE LICAVOLI (Detroit and Phoenix Top Hoodlum) was

his weight" around at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas, and,

in his broken leg. Informant was unable to ascertain at

this time who administered the beating, but he will attempt

Impression that ROSELLI was living at his apartment on

Crescent Heights Boulevard.

On 12/19/60 a pretext telephone

call was made to Roselli's apartment, and a man answered the

telephone.
