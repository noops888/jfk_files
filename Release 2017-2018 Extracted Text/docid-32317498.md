briefly with ROSSELLI in the steam room area, and ROSSELLI

Immediately asked informant 1f he had seen

"that guy"

(meaning GEORGE SEEDVAN, for whom informant may work in

connection with SEEDMAN's vending machine operation):

ROSSELLI immediately started telling informant what informant

should tell SEEDMAN and again requested informant to find

out all he could about SEEDMAN=

Thereafter, FRIEDMAN and ROSSELLI went into the

cocktail lounge at the Friar's Club and joined the unknown

man mentioned above.

on 12/14/62 LA 4268-C advised that on the previous

day, 12/13/62, he observed ROSSELLI at the Iriar's Club at

about five o'clock playing carda with an individual named

ALEXANDER RUDOLPH.

ROSSELLI was losing money and FRIEDMAN

took his place and shortly after "got ROSSELLI even."

close friend and business associate of ROSSELLI, 1s currently

writing and directing a Biblleal ploture.

know for whom he was working or the name of the picture.

colored

pletures of them seated in the cocktall lounge. They

then went into the dining room where another group colored

ploture was taken at which time the doors were open into the
