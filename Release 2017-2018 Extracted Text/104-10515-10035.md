reference:

RI: Tracing continuing:

The following additional information has been corained since

The New Orleans States-Item of 3 March 1967 stated that

New York radio station WINS said thit it had tarred from reliable

sources that GARRISON belores that President Kranedy Was

assassinated by "a group of ploiters directed from Ceba." WINS

reporter Doug Edilson said that the source has access to GARRISON's

files and that, according to the files, "afler an abertive CLA invasion

of Cuba, Castro put out an execution order on de President.!

A memorandum of l May 1967 by Mr. Sichard H.

Lansdale, Associnte General Counsel, advises that GARRISON

"intends to demand that CLA furnish him with the photograph of Oswall

cntcring or exiting the Mexico City Einbassy."

James Phelan is the author of the lead article in the

Saturday Evening Post of 6 May 1967, headed " Plot to Kill Kennody?

Rush to Judgment in New Orleans":

The follniving key points chiefly

concern GARRISON:

(1) Phelan knew GARRISON in 1983, when he spent

ton days with him, obtaining material for a laudalory piece

called, "The Vice Man Cometh".

(2)

GARRISON and Pholan met in Las Vegas on 5 and

6 March 1907, and Phelan conducted ten trars of inserviews.

GARRISON gare Phelan a memorandim of as inferricw con-

ducted with Perry RUSSO by Andrew J. SCIANBR%, "a 3l-ycaI-

old assistant D.A, just a year our of lay school' no interviewed

RUSSO for three hours and took copious pars. GARRISON also

gave Pholan a transcrip: of what RUSSO said four days later, on

1 March 1967, while under hypnosis. The SalAMbiA report

0:UN21

made no mention of a plot among OSINLD, Fennile, and

STAN 10 KiU anyone. The 3,500-vord report Aiso made no

reference ton pirly at FEkklu's aparinent.

Il did not

contain a positive taent

incation of Lee Harvey OSWALD as

"Lion" OSWALD. Shown a picture of Cly Sitaw, Russo had

not identified him as BERTRAND's The SCLAMORA report

specified that KUSSO had scon SIll only twicc, 1c-did not

Bay thut SilAY knew OSWALD.

(3) On 27 February 1967, according to a second

SCIAMINA report, RUSSO was given sodium pontothal and

then did make passing reference to the porty he which the

plot was discussed", but did so only after prompting by

SCIAMIRA, who wrote, "I then asked hun at he could remen-

ber any of the details about Clay Bertrand bring up in FERRIES

apartment."

(1) Two days later Dr. Esmond FATTER placed

RUSSO under hypnosis (he did so three times in all). When

RUSSO made no mention of a party or plot, FATTER directed

him lo sce la picture of FERKIE's apartment and there are

several people in there and there is a white-haired man. Tell

me about it." RUSSO complied but made no mention of SILAl,

"BERTRAND", or a plot FATTER then ordered hin to see

this picture: "There will be Bortrand, Forrie and Oswald and

they are going to discuss a very important maller and there is

another man one girl there and they are talking about assassina-

ting somebody. Look at it and describe it to me.! RUSSO

then told the story that he subsequently gave in testimony.

(5)

Phelan advised GARRISON of the profound differences

between the first SCIAMBIA report and the eventual RUSSO

testimony: GARRISON perinitted Phelan to question SCLAMBRA

direclly, in GARKISON's presence. SCLAMBRA said that he

must have forgolen to include the party and its participants.

When Philan sugrested consulting his original notes, SCLAMBRA

said that he had burned them, Phelan asked Dr. FATTER

where he goe the information used in questioning RUSSO under

hypnosis, and FATTER said it came from GARRISON's office.

the date of references

The following additional information has bech obtained since,

that Gordon Duine NOVEL (sce Enclosure 19 of reference), tien living

in Columbus, Ohie, was the subicet of extradition charges signed

17 April 1967 bj Acting Governor C.C. Aycock. The charges concern

conspiracy to burglarize the munitions bunker at Houma, Lonisiana,

in 1961. On 18 April 1967 NOVEL stated in an article copyrighted by

the Dallas Daily News that GARRISON is conducting his prolic 1o

further his political carcer.

"The whole GARRISON investigation

thing is fiction, " NOVEL added.

"I know the full story from working

as the prosccutor's security chief." GARRISON, however, has said

that NOVEL never worked fos him. NOVEL added, "I think GARRI-

SON will espose some CIA operations in Louisiana. "

b.

The Now Orleans States-Item of 25 April 1967 states that

NOVEL "has told a number of triends and intimates he was a CIA:

oporative and will use this role to battle GARRISON's charges.

if he is returned to Now Orleans to face accusations that he burglarized

an oil scrvice company's munitions bunker in scarby Terrobonne

Parish," Steven PLOTKIN, allorney for NOVEL, refused to cottirm

or deny his client's statements. Sergio ARCACHA Smith (sce En-

closure ? of reference) is also accused by GARRISON of helping to

plan the theft of the munitions.

The article adds, "To friends and

associates, NOVEL has said that the munitions burglary was no

burglary at all -- but a war materials pickup made at the direction

of his CIA contact, " He has described the louma bunker as a Ch

cache for munitions destined for use in the April 19ul invasion at the

Bay of Pigs. NOVEl, has claimed that he worked for CLA in New

Orleans before April 1961. "Part of his job, he cortonds, was to

opcrate th: Evergreen Advertising Agency as a front for CLi

communications. With funds funneled to him by the CIA, NOVEL

They loaded the boxes of ordnance on trucks, he continues,

and returned to New Orleans where the explosives were dropped in

Urce spots - FERRIEts home, NOVEL's office building, and the

office of. former FBlagent Guy BANISTER'(see Enclosure

3 of reference). NOVEl claims the munitions were eventually taken

by boat to Cuba for A diversionary Buy of Pigs opcration. GARRISON,

however, says the burglary occurred three months after the Bay of

Pigs. Ile adds that the flouma bunker was leased by the Schlumberger

Well Services Co. of llouston, Texas.

"Schlumberger officials say

they know nothing of any CIA opcrations in connection with their

mingazine, where oil field service equipment and certain low-yield

explosives

are storcd."

An AP wire dispatch of 26 April 1967 from New Orleans

"In Columbus, NOVEL said today that "the statements that 1

worked for the CIA are absolutcly incorrect. The cents of

1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion; are none of anybody's business,

including Mr. GARRISON's.'"

RI has no record of the Evergreen Advertising Agency. There

is, however, a record of "Evergreen Enterprise," listed as "cover for

illegal activities".

The pertinent document will be obtained and studied.
