She had just received a teletape answer from the Los

Angeles 00 Field Office regarding the undersigned's request

for a specific date and place of contact with Mrs. Monica

F. Kramer and the specific date on which the Agency received

the "now

The L.A. Field Office has in its files a copy of a letter

serit to Mrs. Kramer by the 00 case officer.
