Interview: Robert Genzman interviewed Joseph Goulden at his

home

concerning an article which Goulden wrote in the Philadelphia

Inquirer on Decmeber 8, 1963, alleging that the FBI had tried

to recruit Lee Harvey Oswald as an informant in 1963.

Goulden stated that he obtained the story from two

sources--Dallas Deputy Sheriff Allan Sweatt (deceased) and an

individual he declined to identify. He stated that Alonzo

Hudkins was not

a source.

Goulden stated that he relied on the word of his sources

and never obtained any other evidence substantiating the alle-

gation. He believes that his sources relied in part on the

fact that FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty's telephone number

was found in Oswald's notebook and possibly on the fact that

an informant number was found among Oswald's possessions after

his arrest on November 22, 1963. Goulden stated that his

memory on these matters is unclear.
