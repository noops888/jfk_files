AB MEMO NO. 194

29 MARCH 1977

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Latin America Division

ATTN

Chris Hopkins

FROM

SUBJECT

: Photo Comparison

REFERENCE: DDO/LA Division Memo, dated 25 March 1977

On 23 March, Chris Hopkins of Latin America Division handcarried

photographs to OTS/GAD for identification comparison.

These photos were

examined by the undersigned and two identification experts of the Disguise

and Identification Section.

2. The results of the comparison is as follows:

Facial. Shape - Close

similarities, although there are slight

differences which are probably due

to subject's age differences.

B.

Chin - Fair similarities-the loss of muscletone due to ageing

is most apparent here.

Hair Line - Again good similarity with the natural ravages of

time factored in.

Set and Proportion of Eyes and Eyebrows - Close similarities.

(Comparison of eve detail is not possible due to poor photo quality)

E.. Nose and Caliper Lines - Close similarities in the nose but

the younger man has no sign of the distinctive caliper lines which extend

from the nose to either side of the mouth on the known Soviet.

This could

be explained by loss of muscletone and/or differences in lighting.

F. Mouth - The shape, proportion and

expression of the mouth and

the whole

area from

the tip of

the nose. to the tip

of the chin is perhaps

the most

distinctive characteristic of both subjects. Here the similarities

are very close.

Photo Comprison

The proportions of the head, check bones and the body style of

the younger man tend to indicate he is of slavic origin.

3.

The results of this type comparison are

rarely absolute and

are

usually limited by poor photo quality or differences in viewing angle.

With that understood it is our opinion the two subjects of the forementioned

photo comparison could very likely be the same person.

If additional

photographs of the subjects, particularly if they are of better quality,

are obtained, we would be happy to examine those as well.

OTS/Graphics and Authentication Division
