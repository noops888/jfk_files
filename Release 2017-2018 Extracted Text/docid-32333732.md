Three individuals identified with

I-66 in Puerto Rico advised on March 28, 1963, that they had

no previous knowledge concerning the date the L-66 raid would

take place and that representatives of the group in Puerto Rico

had furnished nothing but money for this raid.. It was stated

the group's funds in Puerto Rico have been exhausted and that

what little money had been available was sent to Pedro Muina

in Miami, Florida.

Concerning the March 18, 1963, raid on Cuba conducted

by members of Alpha 66 and the Second National Front of Escambray

(SNFE), our Miami Office on March 29, 1963, interviewed

Armando Fleites, a leader of the SNFE, who has previously been

identified as having participated in this raid.

Fleites

claimed

that all boats and weapons which figured in this

raid;

as well as all participating personnel, are still located in

an area of the Caribbean which he declined to identify... However,

he insisted that no part of the action or preparation

occurred in United States territory, including Puerto Rico or

With regard to the use of British territory in connection

with these raids, it is noted that the British territory in

closest proximity to Cuba is the Cay Sal Bank, located 40 miles

northern coast of Cuba. This Bank includes many

uninhabited islands and stretches over hundreds of miles of

water.- A representative of British Intelligence who is locatec

at: Nassau, Bahama Islands, advised our Miani Office on March I9.,

1963,

that the British Government in the Bahamas has very few

patrol boats and that the Cay Sal is difficult to patrol because

of its great distance from Nassau.

He acknowledged that the

majority of recent anti-Castro raids have reportedly been

conducted from islands located in the Cay Sal Bank
