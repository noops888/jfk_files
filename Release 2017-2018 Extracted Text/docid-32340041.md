Re 0-1 Form dated 5/10/68.

La

MICHAEL MC LANEY, as previously advised, was

' the subject of extensive publicity in connection with

his aid to the political campaign, preceding the election ON.C,

held in the Bahama Islands in January, 1967. MC LANEY's

(formerly MM 764-C-TE) purpose was to secure some interest

in Bahamian gambling activities.

During 1967, MC LANEY testified before the

Commission of Inquiry, which was investigating gambling

in the Bahamian Islands.

Up to that time, MC LANEY was

optimistic that Premier

LYNDEN PINDLING would aid as well

as cooperate in setting up gambling controls and a revision

of the Bahamian gambling laws, possibly under a commissioner

HEREIM IS UNCLASSIFIED'

•RYSPLRTA

or supervisor of gambling, which MC LANEY hoped to obtain.

After this failed, MC LANEY sought some connection with

gambling on Paradise Island, but Premier PINDLING refused

to aid or approve of MC LANEY's plans.

In 1967, MC LANEY sued the publishers of "Life"

and "Saturday Evening Post" over articles which appeared

in their magazines.

These law suits reportedly are still

pending.

DATE

On 4/16/68, MC LANEY advised he is out of the

gambling picture in the Bahama Islands as he can secure

no consideration along those lines and now hopes to get

into some land development projects on the outer Bahamian

Islands, if the Bahamian Government will cooperate with him.

MC LANEY and an associate are presently operating

the Cumberland House Restaurant in Nassau..
