RE: MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCES

You are reminded that whenever requesting authority

to install a microphone surveillance of any kind, complete

details of the proposed installation must be furnished,

specifically pointing out if trespass is involved and whether

the microphone will be installed in the telephone or a tele

phone instrument will be utilized in any way. Mere statements

that trespass is not involved or that microphone will be in-

stalled in a living room are not sufficient. Bureau desires

specific details of each contemplated installation.

In addition, when advising that a microphone

surveillance has been

discontinued state whether you have been

able to remove all equipment at the time of discontinuance.

It is realized that due to lack of maximum security such removal

may not be immediately effected and if such is the case keep

the Bureau advised every 15 days after discontinuance of efforts

being made to remove all evidence of the microphone surveillance.

Each

Special Agent In Charge must continue to personally

supervise all microphone surveillances and the Bureau will closely

scrutinize each installation and discontinuance to insure that

you are acting in compliance with the foregoing.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

(A) FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM - FIELD SERVICE

FROGRAM - One-day training sessions relating to the Federal

Employees Health Benefits Progran will be conducted within each

Civil Service Commission region in the immediate future.

These

sessions will cover:

(1) a review of the Federal Employees Health

Benefits Act of 1959; (2) proposed regulations; 13, discussion of

some of the agency responsibilities; and (4) other pertinent infor-

mation currently available. Regional Offices of Civil Service

Commission will contact our field offices to determine identity

of person or persons selected to attend these training sessions

and to arrange for such attendance.

Persons to attend training

should be those assigned responsibility for the program in tha

field and those who will train and counsel other employees.

Larger offices may want to designate several persons; smaller

offices may desire to designate only one individual. Each office

should have at least one ranking clerical employee, such as Chief

Clerk or Assistant Chief Clerk, attend these sessions.

Within five days of receipt of this letter, every office

should inform the Bureau as to the identity of the person or

persons selected for this training, and unless you are advised

to the contrary by the Bureau, it will be satisfactory for such

personnel to attend the sessions.

"Report of Medical

One of three copies attached should be placed in

the FBI Form Book and additional copies are being sent separately

for immediate use upon receipt.

The new standards are based upon

the

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company table recently prepared

following its current detailed study.

The only revision to FD-300 constitutes substitution of

the new weight chart for the old one. This new chart makes no provi-

sion for maximum weights and it lists only desirable weight ranges

for respective heights and frames. Employees not within desirable

practice encourages the officers to read the Reprint with a purpose

in mind and stimulates profitable study. Consider adopting this

(K) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES, CHANNELIZATION OF INFORMATION RECEIVED

FROM -- When a stencil is prepared to channelize information re-

ceived from informants and

sources to various files in the field

office, the block stamp may be typed on the stencil. In such

instances, the date to be used in the block stamp is the date the

typing was completed.

For the information of those offices having multilith

equipment, the Chicago Office has advised that the multilith

company markets "auplimat stamp pad ink."

Chicago has used such

stamp pad ink in a regular stamp pad and has used a regular block-

stamp machine in stamping the block stamp upon the multilith

material before it is duplicated. The special ink thus block

stamped on the material is fully reproduced when the material is

run off.

This special ink cannot be used for mimeographed

reproduction.

If used, the above procedure should be confined to copies

for use within your own office.

(A) . PERSONNEL MATTER - LIMITED DUTY AGENTS - PREMIUM OVERTIME --

I am concerned over the number of Special Agents whose physical

limitations prohibit them from discharging the normal, everyday

responsibilities expected of our agent personnel. In many

Instances physical limitations not only restrict such agents from

performing arduous duties but also result in only token compliance

with overtime requirements toward premium pay.

You should of course insure that each limited duty agent

is assigned duties consistent with his physical limitations.

Each SAC should immediately review the performance of

all limited duty agents within his office to ascertain in what

respects the agent's physical limitations prevent him from handling

all duties and overtime responsibilities inherent in the Special

Agent position. In those instances where it is found that the

Special Agent's physical disability prevents him from completely

discharging normal agent duties including equitably sharing the

office overtime, you should carefully analyze his case to determine

if he is, in fact fulfilling all requirements necessary to qualiiy

for premium overtime pay, Should it appear that his physical

condition precludes his meeting all necessary requirements to

qualify for premium pay benefits, he should not continue to be

certified for such benefits.

Particular attention should be given

to those who are consistently below the office average overtime.

The mere fact that he performs the amount of overtime necessary

to qualify for premium pay is not sufficient. He must meet the

necessary requirements as to frequency and type of overtime called

for by the Fringe Benerits Act.

This would include availability

for weekend and emergency duty beyond normal working hours.

You should immediately submit your comments to the

Bureau as to each limited duty agent in line with the foregoing,

together with your recommendations concerning his

continued

eligibility for premium pay benefits.
