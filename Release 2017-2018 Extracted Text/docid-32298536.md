Re: FRANCISCO EDUARDO CASUSO Y PEREZ

When the two boys were growing up, Dr. ENRIQUE

CASUSO Y CASUSO, a medical doctor in Havana, Cuba, was

very strict in his discipline of the two boys, and he demanded

a high degree of performance in

their school and other

activities. ENRIQUE waS

able to rise to the standards set

by his father and became a very outstanding young man. On

the other hand, FRANCISCO fell behind and developed emotional

problems at an early age. He was given some psychiatric

treatment in Cuba, but Dr. GABRIEL CASUSO was of the opinion

that the treatment met with negative results. He described

FRANCISCO as being harmless, but a chronic liar, who lives

entirely in a world of fantasy. Dr. CASUSO noted that

FRANCISCO, after coming to the United States after the Bay

of Pigs Invasion, had been sent to the Devereaux School in

Texas for treatment of his mental condition.

He remained

there for a year or so and was released after being supposedly

cured of his emotional problems. Dr. GABRIEL CASUSO was

of the opinion that the treatment was not effective since his

emotional problems appear to have remained with him. (4)

NOL'EMBER

MM T-1 on December 12, 1968, made available

copies of documents which were found in CASUSO's possession

One of these items

was a copy of a letter purported to be from the Ministry of

War, Cuban Government in Exile, and asked the addressee to

extend to the bearer, Mr. DAVID COSTELLO, the usual courtesies

given to a diplomatic representative. From CASUSO's state-

ments it appears that he is identical with DAVID COSTELLO.

The document was purportedly signed by Dr. ENRIQUE HUERTA,

"Ist Secretary, Ministry of War, and MANUEL ARTIME-BUESA,

"Chief of the Staff of the Army of Liberation."^

MM T-1 furnished in addition a similar

document

requesting the same courtesies to be extended to Second

Lieutenant DAVID HAROLD NORTHINGTON, further identified as

Attache for Financial Affairs for Cuban Government in Exile

in Canada.

This document was also to serve as a valid

driver's license for Lieutenant NORTHINGTON. This document

was also purportedly signed by Dr. ENRIQUE HUERTA,

"lst

Secretary, Ministry of War," and MANUEL ARTIME-BUESA, "Chief

of the staff of the Army of liberation. "C!

of documents which contained

his signature and it was noted

that the signature contained on the above document as

"ENRIQUE HUERTA" does not resemble that of Dr. ENRIQUE HUERTAS.

contacted at his residence, 1270 N.

E 85th Street. Miami

(MRR), and stated that during the Bay of Pigs Invasion he

of the Bay of Pigs, Brigade 2506; however, he denied that

he had ever belonged to any organization known as the

'Armv of Liberation' or that he had ever served as "Chie
