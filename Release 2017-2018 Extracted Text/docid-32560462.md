On this occasion informant learned that BRUNO's

proposed contract with the City of Philadelphia had gone to

the extent that the City Council had appropriated money for

the proposed contract.

in this contract would have to bid for the contract but that

it appeared that this bid would be only to comply with

formality.

It was reported that BRUNO's associates had not

at this time made final payment on the land to be purchased

in Salem County, N. J., where the garbage will be dumped.

on 12/18/59, informant said that he had met with

City Councilman SAMUEL ROSE on. 12/14/59 and thought that

in the near future he would have details on the latest

development of ANGELO BRUNO's contemplated contract with

the City of Philadelphia.

on 12/21/59, informant said that he had been

consulted by BRUNO and his associates regarding the securing

of a contract for the City of Philadelphia after conference

with Councilman ROSE.

Informant said that it now appears

that the original deal would not go through due basically

to strong opposition developed near the proposed dumping

site in salem, N. J. Informant was reported to have dis-

cussed with ROSE the possibility of handling garbage disposal

and dumping in Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pa., which

according to the informant may have in some way brought about

the present situation in order that the informant could

secure the contract for himself. Informant pointed out

that

if he secured the contract, BRUNO would in no way enter

into the business..

The following information, even though not derived

from a confidential source, is included in this portion

of the cover letter as it would have no meaning if included

in instant report without benefit of the preceding information:

Philadelphia Inquirer 12/23/59 reported that a

"storm of opposition"

developed being led by the Mayor.of

Bridgeton, N. J., and a State Senator from Cumberland County,

based' all opposed to using grounds for the dumping of refuse,

on the danger to health and loss of natural wildlife.
