MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Review of the Cuban Operation and Examination of Possibilities for

Her.ispheric Support from Liberal Governments

TIME & PLACE: QODALE's Home; 2245 Hours, 1 April 1960

PARTICIPANTS: DCI; C/WHD; C/wH/4; General Robert Cushman, Vice Presidential

Military Aide; Mr. Walter Donnelly, Vice President of U. S.

Steel; and Mr. William Pawley, Industrialist

I. The DCI opened the meeting by stating that everybody present should

be renoved from power in Cube. He said the necessary approval had been given

exile".

The DCI went on to say that CIA has been in contact with several non-

BATISTA groups which will form the nucleus of this government. These groups

were identified as the Montecristi group, the VARONA group, the Catholic

Action Front and private Cuban citizens; such as, Dr. RUBIO Padilla.

2. The DeI said that the government in exile had not yet found a seat of

covernment, but thet consideration is being given to Venezuela, Costa Rica,

Puerto Rico and Mexico.

He indicated that the United States has been ruled

out and that Puerto Rico also is out of the question, since MUNOZ Marin's

attitude toward CASIRO Is not firmly crystalized. The DCI then requested any

thoughts the group might have on this subject.

Mr. Donnelly suggested that

consideration might be given to Canada. The DCI said that In many ways Canada

would be a good choice, but indicated that relations with Canada on other

Sue tro coted thes

matters are such that Canada probably could not be used. The possibility of

using Colombia or Mexico was then mentioned. C/WID said that serious consideration

had been given to the use of Mexico, but that present indications are that Presi

dent LOPEZ Mateos would not be enthusiastic about permitting a"government" to

establish its base in his country®

Regarding, Colombia, both C/WHD and Mr.

Donnelly said that the recent elections in Colombia, which came as somewhat of

a surprise, cast serious doubt on the use of Colombia for this purpose. Haiti

was mentioned, but ruled out because of its proximity to the Dominican Republic

and the unsettled political situation. C/WHD said that for the moment the best

choice appeared to be Costa Rica, and he Indicated that he had been in contact

with Adolph Berle who had shown willingness to approach ex-President Jose

FIGUERES vis-a-vis permitting the exile government to locate Itself there.

Both Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Pawley agreed that Costa Rica, for many reasons,

would be the best choice. During the summerization of possibilities, Mr. Pawley

mentioned the recent case of General PEDRAZA and Francisco CAJIGAS as a CASe

In point of the U.S., which illustrated the sensitivity of the United States

being used by the exiles. Mr. Pawley explained that at C/WHD's direction,

he had persuaded General PEDRAZA to leave the country. Mr. Pawley said he

had contacted General PEDRAZA through General DIAZ Tamayo and advised him that

an extradition request would soon be received from Cuba and there was a strong

likelihood that General PEDRAZA would be picked un and held pending extradition.

He said that General PEDRiZA had reacted to this irmediately and had departed

for Ciudad Irujillo the day following his conversation with Mr. Pawley.

3. The DCI Informed the group that plans have already been made to

supplement U.S. Governnent funds from private confidential sources to defray

the cost of the Cuban operation. He turned the details of this discussion

over to C/WHD. C/WHD explained that over and above a bond issue, which will

be floated in the name of the government in exile with Mr. Pawley's help,

that donations are being made by private citizens and corporations. He indicated

that confidential arrangements have already been made with the Bureau of Internal

Revere to permit individuals or corporate entitles making donations to claim

these donations as contributions to the U.S. Covernment for tax purposes. He

cautioned that this arrangement is being limited to a very small group.

On the matter of the bond issue, Mr. Pawley said he was still waiting

to receive from CIA an acceptable list of Cuban exiles who will sign the bond

For the general information of the group, it was explained that two

candidates had been decided upon, but that a final decision on the last two is

still pending.

Possible signers mentioned were Dr. Antonio VARONA, head of

the Autentico

Party, and DI. RUBIO Padille.

4. Mention of Dr. VARONA's and Dr. RUBIO Padilla's names led to a

discussion of the ex/infiltration problems facing CIA. The group was told

that CIA is rapidly developing exfiltration capabilities by sea and air. Mr.

Pawley said that if CIA desired to expand this capability beyond present planning,

the Chalk Alr Line, operating out of Miami, could be purchased for a reasonable

price. He indicated that this air line operates five "widgins" in the Caribbean

area. C/WHD expressed Inmediate interest in this air line and indicated he

would have a representative of WID In Miant early the week of 4 April to l00%

at the company.

5. CIA plars for clandestine radio broadcasts were covered with the group.

The precise location of the transmitter was not revealed, but group members

were told that a series of hard-hitting broadcasts will be mounted in the near

The group was also told that USIA 1s Increasing its radio effort and

that the Montecristi group will be mountirg Independent broadcasts from WRUL

in the United States by April 15. The group wes told that CIA has already

gathered some talent to produce programs for the radio broadcasts and that

additional personnel is being exfiltrated to be employed in a production work-

shop, which will produce tepes that will be put on the air by the clandestine

transmitter. Finally, the group was told that broadcast time in the name of

the "government in exile" will also be arranged with radio stations scattered

throughout the Caribbean.

Apart from radio operations, it was noted that Mr. Pawley has already made

arrangenents for the printing of Diario de la Maring, the Leading Cuban dally

newspaper, In Miami. It was further Indicated that CIA will arrange clandestine

distribution of this newspaper throughout Latin America and Cuba es a part of

its other propaganda activities.

6. The DCI raised the question of hod ve play the overthrow of CASTRO

with the other Latin Anerican Republics; 1.e., what should be done through the

QAS. Mr. Fawley said that he thought cu: illitary Missions abroad could be

used more effectively. He Indicated he felt that Mission personnel, properly

briefed, could do much to bring the situetion into focus in Latin America by

keeping their Latin American counterparts briefed on a continuing basie. He

also lamented the fact that historically the Department of State has frequently

blocked the travel of Latin American milltary officers to and from the States

on the theory that 1t would not be good for latin American relations. (It was

during this discussion that the case of General Jesus Maria CASIRO Leon was

mentioned, citing the possibillty he might be refused a visa to the United

States for political reasons. General Cushman was briefed on the vital role

that General CASTRO played In protecting Vice President Nixon until his departure

from Venezuela in May 1958. General Cushman said he would take action to see

that General CASTRO is not denied a visa to the United States.)

T. The question of whether o1l sanction could be an effective weapon

against CASTRO was mentioned. The DCI and C/WID stated that they anticipated

The oil companies have recognized the fact

that sooner or later Cuba will turn to the Sino-Soviet bloc for 01l. Donnelly

speculated that CASTRO is, in fact, playing the United States off against the

Soviets in the matter of oil importation and that the only limiting factor

in this gambit is the probable fact that the Soviets will want cash for oil

they deliver.

8. Considerable time was spent discussing the present pathetic effort on

the part of the Catholic Church to face up to the Communist threat in Cuba.

The discussion revealed that the Church's inaffectiveness stems from fractionali-

ration within the hierarchy and a complete absence of leadership on the part

of the Papal Muncio, further complicated by his secretary's close connivance

with the extreme left. Two lines of action were agreed upon to remedy this

situation:

(a) The DCI directed that a cable be sent to

Irmediately, requesting that be approach the Vatican at the proper

level and briefly explain the Church's situation In Cuba. He would

also request that the Vatican send a senior official to Cuba to

Investigate and return to the Vatican with specific recommendations.

(Note:

A cable to Rome was prepared on 4 April.)

(b) The Director indicated he would be attending a dinner

being given by the Apostolic delegate in Washington for Mr. Robert

Murphy of the Department of State on 12 April. He indicated he would

endeavor to apprise the delegate of the Cuban situation during this

dinner.
