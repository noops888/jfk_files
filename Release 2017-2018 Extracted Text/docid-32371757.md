Memo for Record

Subject: LIONION Photo Operation targeted against the Cuban Consulate

From: RSG

SUMMARY

camera

Available records show that the VIS-2, an automatic triggering device,

in process of

waspeing installed at the LIONION basehouse on 27 Sept. 63. This device

was to be used with the K-100 16mm movie camera or the Robot Star 35mm

These systems were

still camera. It was aimed at the gate of the Cuban Consulate. The first

test pictures were sent to Hegaquarters at attachments to HMMA-22433 on

7 Hovember 1963. One of the attachments, (A), shows the VIS-2 coverage of

the Consulate gate. Obvious in this photo is a sign indicating the hours'

of the Consulate (for visas). The hours are 10-2, Monday through Friday. The date

test phate wras

taken is unknown.

A later monthly report for 1-31 December 1963, (HMMA-22726), discusses the

installation of a SEQUENCE camera on 17 Deember 1963 with hours of operation

against the Consulate of 0900 to 1400,

office hours of the Consulate)

Subsequent monthly reports confirm that the SEQUENCE camera was indeed

the Pulse Camera. Saxension oohaurs The record, then, shows :

A. The Pulse Camera was installed, for the first time,

on 17 December 1963.

B. No coverage of the Consulate existed prior to 27 Sept. 1963

DISCUSSION

HSCA Researchers, Dan Hardway and Ed Lopez, reviewed Agency files on

the following dates:

26 May 1978

22 June 1978

5 July 1978

20 July 1978

21 July 1978

This files contain materials cited in the SUMMARY, including sample

photos of the Consulate gate using the K-100 and Robot Starr systhes

triggered by the VIS-2 taken during a teet period. These systems are

resultant

readily identifiable by nature of the prints. The K-100 is 16mm format

and is so marked on the reverse side of the print (although misidentified

as Attachement A to HMMA-22433 when it should have been Attachment B).

The Robot Star is 35 mm format. Kithesboth None of these prints,

which were sent to Headquarters as test resalts on 7 November 1963, has the

distinctive mark of the Pulse Camera in the lower left corner. The Bulse

Camera recorded a time/date image in the lower left corner from an internal

Accutron movement. This can be seen in a sample picture sent to Headquarters

i mart tie

on 22 June 1965](HMMA-26414), entitled Details of LIONION Pulse Camera

Operation. This report confirms, too, that the Pulse Camera did not begin

operation until "mid-December 1963."

INFERENCES

concludes from Duran testimany that

The Warren Commission record assuems Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate

surrestime after

upen arriving in Mexico City on the korning of 27 September 1963. That

same morning, across the street at LIERODE basehouse, the new trigger device

and K-100/Robot Star systems were in provess of being installed. If the installation

were to have gone smoothly, the systems may have been tested against the

supposed

target at the very moment when Oswald super is ascuned to have appeared. However,

the reocra of that monnings efforts shows that the K-100 had a malfunctioning

part which had to be re-machined. Sneethe Geneulate slased it 1400, there.

is confirmed to have visited the Consulate between 1600 and 1630. Since he

appeared after normal hours of the photo operation, which terminated at the

published Consulate closing time of 1400, the Ikelihood of having a photo

on that visel

of hintis remote. Even if such coverage were to have occured during morning

testing and when Oswald was onty aesung to have been at the Consulate,

suprayed

the record does not-show ange That

visit

Assuming that LIONION-I began work on Monday morning, 30 September 1963 at

normal hours and started to operate the new K-100 and Robot Star systems against

the Consulate gate for test purposes as he was instructed to do (HMMA-22307),

the test photos sent to Heaaquarters may have been the result. The None of

these individuals appears to be Oswald. The Warren Commission concludes, too,

that Oswald only visited the Consulate on 27 and 28 September. 28 Spptember

is a Saturday. The Consulate is closed (according the to the posted sign).

The LIONION aparatinxenkoups basehoude only operated Mondays thyouh Friday

It is possible that

this installation, begun in the morning, may have taken

well into the afternoon to complete becaused (1) this was a new installation

and

in a new room of the basehouse (2) the technicians experienced problems with

on the target

the equipment. The ultimate set-up would have been testedlwhen it was complete.

But the Consulate officially closed at 1400 hours, alter which there would

have been few, if any, targets (at the gate) for test purposes! It may have

been likely, then, that the instalation, when completed, was not tested

against actlal (and avalable) targets until the opening of business, Monday

morning, 30 September. Oswald is not known to have visited the Consulate

Saturday

afterf28 September.

No photo coverage was the ald with thats site died not

operate on Saturdays...

Silva-Duran's testimony indicates that Oswald visited the Consulate twice

on Friday, 27 Septenter: in the morning when she directed-him to the Soviet

Consulate;

in hhe afternoon (4 pm) when she telephoned the Soviet Consulate

and

when the Cuban Counsel, Azque argued with Oswald. The "morning visity which

vas Oswald's first contact with the luban consulate seula hidaynave occured!

during official office hours,

10-2. This is strengthened by the fact the

he was again at the Consulate, after business hours, at 4 pm. If he had not

visited earlier during normal business

hours, he eottle have been rebuffed

breturn

on Minderg

at the 4 pm visit

with the suggestion that he come during business hours? He

was not rebuffed

,. from which I suggest that hep therefore, visited the

Consulate before 2 pm. and, mostly likely, during the very houss that the

technocians were in process of setting up the new installation in LENÖION

across the street.

I conclude that the f probablity of having taken a photo of Oswald during

his visit(s) to the Cuban Consulate on 27 Sept. 1963 is remote.

4. Use of the VLS-2 Irigger Device at the LIERODE Basehouse

7 Nov. 63

HMMA-22133

Seen by DH and EL 6/22

"The VLS-2 Trigger Device, installed athe LIERODE bashhouse to

cover the Consulate entrance, is performing well with little

false triggering."

"See Enclosure A for the VLS-2 area of coverage"

"I=22 (LIONION-I) used the K-100 with a 152mm lens for

one day, turning in 10 feet of 16mm film. (See Enclosure

B for the results of this testing.)"

NOTE: This could have occurred on the Monday aiter

the eqpt was installed. i.e. 30 Sept. 63.

Thus, the coverage for that day (which can

be found) only amounts to this one test

picture. It is definitely the K-100, as

distinguished from the Pulse Camera

because it is 16 mm.

"The Robot Star (35mm)...1s. now being used with the VIS-?

on this project. (See Enclusure C for this coverage)

5. Operational Monthly Report - 1-30 Sept. 63

HMMA -22307 18.0ct. 63

"On the morning of 27 Sept. 63, a technician

installed the VLS-2 Irigger Device a t the

LIERODE basehouse"

"I-22 (LIONION-I) was requested to test the Robot Star

camera for 4 days and the K-100 for another 4 days.

When satisfactory results of this testing become

available to the Station, they will be forwarded to

Ors/Photo Ops Branch for examonation."
