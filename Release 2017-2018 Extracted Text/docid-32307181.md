Special Agent ELMER C. MULLEN was the Agent who

conducted spot checks of the subject's residence and place

of employment on numerous occasions during the period

covered by instant report.

It is noted the subject was recommended for

occupancy of the apartment at 7926 East Drive, Apartment

4, Harbor Island, Miami Beach, Florida, by RICHARD BERGSTRESSER,

Miami attorney who occupies Apartment 2 at above address and

is also engaged as subject's attorney.

It is noted that RICHARD

BERGSTRESSER is the subject of Miami

file 97-390, a Registration

Act case. BERGSTRESSER is a partner in the firm

Taylor and

Bergstresser located at Suite 803, Biscayne Building, Miami,

Florida.

It is also noted that BERGSTRESSER and TAYLOR have

in the past represented Cubans in litigations in the Miami

area and'have also represented the Cuban government.

Referenced Bureau letter dated June 7, 1961,

indicates that the Central Office of Immigration and

Naturalization Service (INS) had advised that a Miami attorney

named BENTON, who had recently returned from a business trip

to Canada, had reported that the subject was in close contact

vite to detains vagane dated detectio

with "CHE"' GUEVARA.

Investigation by the Miami Office has indicated

that SAM BENTON is a business partner with the subject in

the G & B Sales, Inc.; and is

shown as the president of this

corporation, with the subject as Treasurer. Inasmuch as

BENTON and

TEJADA are officers of the same business firm,

BENTON has not yet been interviewed, pending development

of additional background information

concerning him, as a

direct interview with the subject will probably be more

desirable and productive if the subject is to be interviewed.
