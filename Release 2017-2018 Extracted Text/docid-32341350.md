PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS RAW, UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

PLEASE DO NOT SEND IT TO THE FIELD IN THIS FORM.

PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY COPIES OF THIS RAW REPORT.

THIS IS AN FBI REPORT.

1. Yuriy NOSENKO spent much of his career in the Sixth Department of the KGB's Second Chief

Directorate (SCD), which was responsible for tourists. He spent only a short time of his career in the First

Department, SCD, which was responsible for American officials at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

2. NOSENKO had excellent family connections because his father was Minister for the

Shipbuilding Industry in the USSR. That is how NOSENKO managed to become a security officer for the

Soviet delegation which traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, for arms control talks. He defected to the United

States from this position.

3. The SCD was quite pleased when U.S. intelligence began to believe NOSENKO was not a bona

fide defector. They were particularly pleased when he was harshly interrogated by the CIA.

4. According to the Source, NOSENKO was not sent to the United States to be a false defector.

Source said that it is against KGB policy to send an intelligence officer as a false defector. Also, the KGB

would never have selected him for such a mission because his father is a high-level Party official.

5.. Source doubts that NOSENKO ever saw OSWALD'S file. According to the Source, NOSENKO

was not higher than a Captain or Major when he defected to the United States. The Source believes that

NOSENKO may have tried to show himself more valuable to the CIA than he really was. At the time of his

defection, NOSENKO was mixing in high circles of Moscow golden youth. The Source believes he

defected for material gain.
