Reference is made to an

article on the investigation

the assassination of President Kennedy in the 3-15-64 issue of

"The Councilor" (received 4-13-64) which identifies itself as

having been published by the Citizens: Council of Louisiana Inc,

for Americans Everywhere.

The article with a date line of New Orleans claims that

"The Councilor" was in New Orleans to make a fresh search into the

assassination matter at the request of the Dallas District Attorney'st

Office.

In addition, the article claims that the Dallas District

Attorney's Office enlisted "The Councilor" to check reports that

"Oswald and Rubenstein" (apparently. Jack Ruby, convicted killer

Of

Oswald) were connected in employment matters.

The article claims that in interviewing personnel difectors?!

and employment agency officials, "The Councilor" learned that agents

from different Government bureaus have taken key documents concerningt

Oswald and have not coordinated their investigative efforts:

Councilor' claims that the biggest feud in this connection exists

between "Douglas Dillon's Treasury agents and Bobby Kennedy's FBI."

The article also states that more people "are working to cover up

the facts than are

trying sincerely to unmask the assassination

plot."

Los

TEXAS

identified by a confidential informant NO 1223-R) as a member:of

that Touchstone claimed that the Klan had

documented proof that President Johnson was formerly a member

of the Klan in Texas during the early days of his political care
