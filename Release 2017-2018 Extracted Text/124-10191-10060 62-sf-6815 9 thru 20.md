The San Francisco Office contacted WEO, who advised that

the area code 212 was a New York area code and

FBI, San Francisco, telephoned the number 212-924-7586.

A male answered the phone and a request was made to speak with

ROBERT LEE LEWIS, who then came to

the phone.

The San Francisco

agent identified

himself as an FBI agent to LEWIS and told him

that he was inquiring about the telephone call that had been

made by him to ED MONTGOMERY, a reporter in San Francisco.

LEWIS admitted

making the telephone call

and stated that he

did not represent himself to be an investigator for the CHURCH

Committee.

He went on at some length and in a rambling manner

relating to many of his past investigative experiences, including

his contacts with EUNICE SHRIVER; a priest at Georgetown;

representatives of the Secret Service, especially Agent DON

CHACOS, and others.

He again denied impersonating a government

investigator; stated that his life was an open book and that

he would have

to contact representatives of the CHURCH Committee

concerning this matter.

He also stated that SA DON CHACOS Of

Secret Service in Washington, D.C., could vouch for him.

He was told that in all

probability that an agent from

the New

He stated that would be fine and that he would request that

à telephonic appointment be made.

SA BOB TITTLE Of WEO telephonically advised that

Secret Service Agent DON CHACOS had advised him that he was aware

of LEWIS and his activities and described him as an over-

that HARRIS answered the door of her residence where

he was solielting for funds.

MC GUIRE said he talked to

HARRIS at length regarding women's lib.

MO GUIRE then told LEWIS that through a third

person he advised the FBI of HARRIS' location. MC GUIRE

said he was then informed through this third person that

the FBI knew of HARRIS's whereabouts and he should keep

the matter in confidence.

LEWIS stated he related this

information to Mrs. MC CARTHY.

LEWIS advised that he then forgot about the

Incident until February, 1976, when he was setting up

• lecture at New York University Law School in New York

city.

LEWIS advised he was reading the New York Mimes

regarding the HEARS! trial

and noted that HEARST and

the HARRIS' were accused of participating

In a bank

robbery in Callfornia on April 15, 1974.

LEWIS said he

then remembered hearine that EMILY HARRTS bad been

located by the FBI In March, 1974.

FBI had mishandled the PATTY HEARST Investigation.

LEWIS said he was advised by KEVES

to call T. V. MC GUIRE and determine the identity of

to the FBI.

LEWIS called MC GUIRE and was advised that

ED MONTGOMERY, a retired San Francisco Examiner Reporter,

was the Individual contacted by MC GUIRE regarding
