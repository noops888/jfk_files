Directories and Tampa Credit Bureau check.

This WILLIE MAE

JACKSON listed residence at 2908z East Chelsea.

On 5/21/61, SAS THOMAS S. LOVERING and LABADIE

interviewed WILLIE MAE JACKSON under pretext of seeking her

for employment, at which time it was determined she was .

not identical to the Negro maid employed at 2505 Bristol

Avenue.

On the night of 5/24/61, the Negro maid, dressed

in a white uniform, at approximately 8:30 PM, was

observed

by SA LABADIE to go to the vicinity of the 2500 block,

DeLeon Street. The 1961 Tampa City Directory reflects

the

following listings in the 2500 block of DeLeon between

Armenia and South Tampania:

2501 - ANNIE L. STEPHENS

2503 - ABR. GLOVER

2505 - JOSEPH DAVIS

no person such as WILLIE MAE at that address. Thereafter,

pretext inquiry of a Negro female at 2505 DeLeon established

she was 79 years of

age, had lived in Tampa for 43 years,

had a daughter named WILLIE MAE, but that her daughter who

works five

days a week was not interested in any other

employment.

She mentioned that her daughter was well paid,.

liked her present employment for "TALLY's," and inferred

her daughter had been working steadily for two years.

It is noted Fisur of subject had to be suspended

Fla., on 5/30/61, which

was committed with the use of shotguns.

residence, and the general topic of conversation concerned

the Cuban situation.

On May 22, 1961, TP T-3 advised SA JOHN D. MEDAGLIA

that although he has

known the subject all his life and that

although he resides in the close proximity of subject's

residence, and that although he had coffee at the Columbia

Restaurant in the morning and in the afternoon, as well as

lunch at such restaurant, he had not seen nor heard the

subject being in Tampa, at his home, nor at the Columbia

Restaurant.

On May 23, 1961, SA LABADIE, while stopped at

the

corner of Morrison Avenue and Howard Street, observed

subject in a 1959 white Chrysler bearing 1961 Florida

license 3W-12672.

Greetings were exchanged between the

subject and SA LABADIE, and subject was asked, "Where are

you going?" to which subject replied, "I'll send you a

report."

Subject then left the area

inasmuch as traffic

was

heavy, and SA BELANGER advised subject immediately
