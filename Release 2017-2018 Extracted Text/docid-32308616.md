that Assistant Legat KEENAN had handled coverage on the subject

in November 1961, when the subject was in Madrid, through

of the Directorate General of Security,

ctual surveillance of the subject having been arranged b

ir. with the Alien Brigade of the Directorate General o

was contacted on 12-22-61 and requested to

verify

whether the call concerning the subject and the other

two individuals had originated with his office or with the

Alien Brigade: Mr.L

subsequently advised on the same date

that the call had not come from his office and that he had

checked with the Alien Brigade and had been told that no call

had been made from that office li(u)

Inasmuch as Mr. HAROLD MOSS, U. S. Treasury repre-

sentative in the Embassy in Paris, had previously expressed

an interest in this matter, the Paris Office was telephonically

contacted on 12-22-61 to ascertain whether the information

contained in the telephone call may have originated with

Mr. MOSS. The Paris Office subsequently advised on the same

date that contact with Mr. MOSS and his office in Paris had

failed to develop any information indicating that they were

responsible for the call. (E) (4)

The Madrid Office is presently endeavoring to verify

through Mr. POZO whether EMIL ARNSTEIN and ROBERT SCHIFF

actually arrived in Madrid on 12-23-61, it being noted that
