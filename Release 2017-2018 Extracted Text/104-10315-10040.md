counsel, the Chiei of Wi Division, ans by Col. ". C. King, forer

Chief of WH Division. Biographic files and intelligence publicaticas

were furnished by the Director of Central Reference. He was not rade

witting of the reason for our interest in then, and those who

assembled them for him were not told for whon they were intended.

We called back four officers for interviews: Richard Bissell,

Sheffield Edwards fron retirement, William Harvey from sick leave,

and Nestor Senchez from nis post in Caracas. Otherwise, our interviews

were confined to officers assigned to the headquarters installation.

We opened each interview by referring to the Drew Pearson column of

7 March 1967, clting that as the reason for our interest in learning

of plots to assassinate Castro. We told those interviewed that we

were on a fact-finding mission on bebelf of the Director, and that

this was not the usual sort of Inspector General Investigation. We

asked each to name any others who were likely to have knowledge of

such plots.

We cautioned each not to discuss the subject of the

Interview with anyone eise-even others whom we might interview.

This is a complete list of those interviewed:
