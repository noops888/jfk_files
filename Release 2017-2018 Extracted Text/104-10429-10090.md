Operational Activities -JulY 1962-January 1964: Summary

To substantiate his claims to having served as Deputy

Chief of the Seventh Department during this period, MOSENKO

describes KGB involvement in the recruitment of

and BARGHOORN, and the investigations

the arrests of swALDe and of former KGB officer CHEREPANOV,

his discovery that

]was a GRU agent, and his assignment

to Geneva.

Even if NOSENKO learned of the operations as

he described and they were as he described (there are substan

tial reasons why they might have been conducted by KGB

elements other than the

Seventh Department), they are atypical

with respect to NOSENKO's Own description of Seventh Depart-

ment operations.

They do not

accurately characterize, as

NOSENKO claims, KGB counterintelligence operations ag√§inst

tourists, and thus do not substantiate his Seventh Department

service.

NOSENKO's explanations. for his assignment to

Geneva in 1964 are no more plausible than for his earlier

assignment there

in 1962.

NOSENKO has asserted that he was

not a lieutenant colonel

as the temporary duty authorization

indicated, but a captain, a rank incongruous with a Deputy

Chief of Department and

one from which he presumably would

have been promoted as he assumed the senior KGB positions

which he claimed to have held.

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, NOSENKO claimed
