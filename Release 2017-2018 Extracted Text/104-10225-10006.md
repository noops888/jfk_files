1. 'Do you feel SAl training was helpful to you? (if you choose to do so, please

Career as

& case officer.

I can think of several instance where SAI could have helped me

turn several falluros (recrültment pitchea) into succeeces.

2.

Did SAI training provide you with any concepts or tools which can be applied

in a practical way to your work problems? To your personal life? Any

examples you care to mention?:

I am abcolutoly cortala that putting

The greatent revelation from an operatlot point of then, was the

clarifeation of perhage an erroncous idea we have about obtaining our intelligence

objectives. I alwaye cerated under the bollof that the rost important thing in

my work vas to attaln my objectives, 1.0. the recruitment of an agent.

Please comment, if you have any definite opinion, on the duration and pace of

the training:

too long/short?

too fast/slow?

The pace of the course was

exellent. However, adding one or two more days would certainly help in putting

the SAI concepts into practice by the truinee hirsolf. That 1s, perhaps a live

N. Flores has made a nost impressive beginning in

1lo has adapted to nes

tasks

and

a new environment

with a mature

assurance and a professional approach. Shortl)

the base sas

temporarily deplored of

other officers.

Tir. Flores carried out the duties of neting

Chief of Base

in a most commendable manner.

His fluency in

Spanish and his Latin bachground have been definite assets in the

pertormance of his duties.

community und they carry out their representational duties very

effectively.

4 Nr.. Flores has proven to lo a

competent oporations

be offered. This 18 called "clearance" of an applicant.

Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearance perhapa something of which the applicant to genuinely un

aware, perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the

Agency make unacceptable.

In any event, adverse findings by the Agency

are conclusive and final

so far as the Agency is concerned, and no state

ment of specific reasons ia made to the applicant.

Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency la not a right upon

which an applicant can insist.

Offer of employment which is subject to

full clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giv

1ng an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim againat, the Agency.

Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearunce i3 at the appli-

cant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage

of applicants are not cleared.

Statement of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid

erations.

If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considera-

tions.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet Ho. 2.

cont.

I and to devise a secure and timely method of

approach to the individual Cuban.

In comaring Mr. Flores' performance as an operations officer and as a

supervisor,

I belice his perforance is somewhat stronger in the former capacity.

Str. Flores has all the attributes of an excellent case officer: he is aggressive,

thinks operationally, and is fast on his teet in an operational situation. He 1s

further aided by his fluency. in Spanish and has on more than one occasion successfully

] During his TDY travels, he has

repeatedly demonstrated dedication to the job at hand, willingness to work long

hours, and a flexibility to handle all types of situations.

Mr. Flores is less enthusiastic when it comes to the paperwork and bureau-

cratic requirements of his position.

while he is a good writer, he tends to handle

his written tasks in a hurried manner and consequently, his work oftentimes requires

review.

He is also inclined to take the shorter and easier approach when handling

the paper flon requirements.

I mention these points not because they represent

basic shortcomings,

but simply to contrast them to his exceptionally high performance

in his operations officer capacity.

Mr. Flores is an extreuely experienced, competent and well motivated

His talent as a "street operator" with a keen sense for the

human target has been amply denonstrated.

Ile has now quite successfully been

introduced to his first supervisory position and proven that he is competent for

assiganents of this nature.

I believe Mr. Flores is capable of handling positions

of increasing responsibility and should be given the opportunity to do so.

Subject has a clear-headed approach to the collection of

intelligence and

to realistic in evaluating potential sources.

Its fluency in the Spanish language hay facilitated his movement

in the local community and he has devoloped several potentially

usciul sources and identified others.

In considering this olficer for promotion, two facts should

bo kept in

mind:

Ho is probably

older and certainly more mature than

the

at his grade level.

He is anxious to

get ahead and this explains much of his initiative and drive.

The rating officer has rated hin very realistically

which,

In my view, adds to the importance of

the outstanding

rating given him on Specific Duty No. 2.

This rater's principal criticiam of this employee is his tendency

toward Impulsiveness and too-quick judgement before weighing ald the

facts and Implications in the pursuit of his operational requirements;

this weakness is more a function of his inexperience in the

field and will be resolved as he gains more field experience..

Subjoct, although exhibiting resourcefulness and imagination in
