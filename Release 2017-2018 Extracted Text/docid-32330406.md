but informant's absence has precluded this. It is not clear at this

time whether he would have furnished us data on this matter and rapid

sequence of events may have prevented

this Irrespective of whether he

would have played it straight or not, his arrest was necessary..

If he

was not dealing honestly with us he deserves arrest and, if he intended

with us truthfully, his arrest was necessary for his oun personal

safety.

(V)

We are furnishing brief summary of facts in letters to

¡attorney General and Vice president Nixon.

Details are being furnished in letter to Criminal Division with

copy to Internal Security Division of Department and in letter to state

with copies

to CIA,

intelligence services of armed forces and Immigration

and Naturalization Service.

In letters 'to Department of Justice only we are confidentially

advising of informait relationship with Fernandez since it is felt

Department must know this rather than be confronted with it unexpectedly

at trial or proor thereto.

To hold out and have to advise Department

later might create impression something was behind concealment. If it

later develops that there are mitigating factors regarding Fernandez we

will advise Department.

ACTION:

Above action is being expedited today.

Whether or not subjects

are eventually convicted or simply returned to cuba their arrest should

serve notice on Castro that such activity will not be tolerated.
