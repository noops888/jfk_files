INDEX

1. Authorization is hereby requested for the project described

below, whick we plan to initiste on l June 1919.

In view cr

the comment contained in parsgraph 2 of referenced communi-

сеслод,

assunine that contencement of this project cr

a simple exploratory basis has already been approved by head-

quarters.

lio further comitients, other than those descriced

below, will be made.

A Objectives

(1) Cutout services, as suggested by headguarters,

an effort to

test Subject's abilities.

(2) As a basie and continuing assignment to permit

and enccurage developnent of Subject's best

local contacts as we'l as in the hope of filling

a long-felt need in cur operational petiern, he

will be assigned to the general topic of labor;

specifically,

communist penetration of local

non-communist labor crouos and theoretical

developments which are of interest regardless

of croup designation.

(3)

Subject appears to be genuinely interested and

to possess an inusual appreciation for coerational

ways and mesns, which is selden encountered.

For this reason, none of his assignuents will

be exclusive, and he will be encouraged to follow

up

such leads and opportunities as arise in the

course of his dally occupations regardless of

any objective and target assignments.

B. Targets

(1)

Subject will corrence by serving as cutout for

Hukeer.

who has always held out great promise but

never been properly developed or directed.

(2)

In the labor field, the principal and only target

at the moment is the only labor federation, the

Rerun Kovarws.

(3)

Subject will t

represent our only contact among the

student groups and

certain allied "intellectual"

societies.

Any activity in this category showing

promise may subsequently become en assigned target.

C. Cryptonym and Essential Data on Personnel

The designation "Hydropathic", heretofore applied to

subject individual, is hereby discarded. He will

hereafter be designated by

Symbol

No. 26.

For essential data on personnel, see TZP-A-365,

Pare I and II.

D. Control and Contect

Judging by Subject's background data and his alreedy

denonstrated cooperative attitude, we do not feel that

control and direction of his activities will be any

problem. Contact, owine to the nature of this project,

will be

freguent and carried out in any convenient

manner, generally in one or the other of our respective

bones.

B. Corer

Subject had planned to and has established himselr in

Costa Rica for entirely personal reasons, prior to any

contact with this office.

He has a Costa Rican wife,

attends the university, and lives a perfectly normal

life which any assignments from us will not disrupt.

Our only anticipated problem is that of moutine contacts

between Subject and the Chief of Station.

will be handled with core and discretion.

F. Cost

DESENSITIZED

Subject has agreed to serve for a salary equivalent

Er one 2?

$50.00 per month,

to be paid in colones. To offset

this expense we plan to dispense with the services of

Hucklebone who 1s presently receiving $400.00 per Ionth.

G. Timine and other Factors

Our preliminary Interviews with Subject lead us to

believe that he will be the interested and relia ble

American cutout for which this station has long felt

a need.

His greatest virtue in this respect appears

to be an understanding of operational methods and an

appreciation of relative valus with respect to infor

mation.

It is hoped to make this a permanent project,

but our plans and our arrangements with Subject are

considered to be probationary, dependent entirely

upon

his development and future usefulness.

TERMINATION SECRECY OATH

I, -

-, an about to terminate my

association with the Organization.

I realize that, by virtue of my duties with

the Organization, I have been the recipient of information and intelligence which 2

concerns the present and future security of our country. I am aware that the

unauthorized disclosure of such information is prohibited by the espionage laws

of our government which specifically requires the protection of intelligence

sources and methods fron unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, I SOLEMNLY SWEAR,

WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DURESS,

AS FOLLOWS:

1. I will never divulge, publish, or reveal by writing, word, conduct, or other-

wise, any information relating to the national defense

and security and partic-

ularly information of this nature relating to intelligence sources, methods,

personnel,

fiscal date, or security neasures to anyone, including, but not limited

to, any future governmental or private employer, private citizen,

or government

employee or official without the express written consent of the Chief of the

Organization or his authorized representative.

2. I have been invited to subait in writing any monetary claims I may have

against the Organization or our government which may in any way necessitate the

disclosure of information described herein.

I have been advised that any such

claims will receive full legal consideration.

In the event, however, that I am

not satisfied with the decisions of the Organization concerning any present or

future claims I may submit, I will not take any other action to obtain satisfac-

tion without prior written notice to the Organization, and then only in accordance

with such legal and security advice as the Organization will promptly furnish me.

3. I do not have any documents or materials in my possession, classified or un-

classified, which are the property of, or in custodial responsibility of the

Organization, having come into wy possession as a result of my duties with the

Organization or otherwise.

4.

During my exit processing and during oy perlod of employment with the Organ-

ization I have been given an opportunity to report all information about the

Organization, its personnel, and its operations which I consider should receive

official cognizance.. Hence, I am not avare of any information which 1t is my

duty, in the national interest, to disclose to the Organization, nor an I aware

of any violations

or breaches

of security which I have not officially reported,

1. The Station would appreciate any information which Headquarters can

provide concerning an ETD for Harold R. NOEMAYR and his family and an

ETA for NOEMAYR's replacement. NOENAYR's tentative ETD of 1 January

1960 is only slightly more than one month away and he has visas to obtain in

addition to other departure preparations.

2. NOEMAYR was instructed by the Station to proceed with the necessary

correspondence with Mexican, Costa Rican, Cuban, and Panamanian authorities

for the required police certificates for his wife since she is not a citizen of

PBFRIME and is applying for an Immigrant Visa. He has already received the

necessary documents from Costa Rica and Cuba and expects to obtain the

Mexican certificate within the next two days. No reply from Panama has been

received as yet although it should arrive shortly. As soon as the Panamanian

clearance and that from Mexico is obtained, NOEMAYR will submit all papers

to the local ODACID installation and request the necessary documentation for

the travel of himself and his family. As Headquarters is aware, the Immigrant

Visa for NOEMAYR's wife will be valid only so long as she travels within four

months of the date issued.

3. An early reply to this dispatch would be appreciated.

Discussions of the whole problem of VAIVADA's early TDY to Headquarters

were held between the agent, the feld case officer,

and the Chief of Station on

13 and ll January, as & result of which it becane clear that, unless Headquerters

has a compelling reason to the contrary, it would be advisable that the conten-

Plated ToY be postponed until about the end of VAIVADA's current contract year,

1.e., the period of July-August 1957.

delay in acquiring staff status that would accrue fron such a postoonerent.

wife is sufficiently 1ll at this time from a form of nervous colitis as to recom

mend that she not travel now. His children would have to lose a semester of

their schooling since the current semester began on 7 January. Moreover as he

and farily have resided in tropical areas for a number of years, VAIVADA would

have to make a rather large financial outlay to purchase needed sinter clothing

for himself and his fantly which does not seem justified for a perlod as sbort

as two months.

Owing to several routine but time-consuming inquirles being made

by the local ODACID in connection with his wife's visa asplication, there is no

guarantee that VAIVADA would be able to depart Cuba before February 1957

two promising sources currently under development by the Station, namely AMPHODARCH-

6 and AYPHODARCH-10, were originally contacted by VAIVADA and he has since been

the person working most closely with them.

To substitute him with a relatively

untrained cut-out at this point in tbeir development is not desirable. On the

basis of the original proposed timing of bis trip the Station has however proceeded

with firm plans to transfer handling of two other sources, AMPHODAPCH-1 and AMBI-

VALENT-5, to a rellable PBPRIME cut-out. This plan can be initiated whether

VAIVADA departs now or later, and provides the ideal opportunity to take two low-

Level sources off VAIVADA's hands thereby freeing the latter to undertake new
