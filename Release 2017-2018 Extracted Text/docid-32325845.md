AT MERIDIAN, MISSISSIPPI

DI T-4 on October 28, 1963, advised SA JOHN H. PROCTOR,

JR., that LEO KINARD 1s a whiskey bootlegger, and has been for a

number of years. DL T-4 did not believe KINARD would hijack any

whiskey, but would buy hijacked whiskey and sell it.

DL T-4 advised he does not know subject DOLAN, but he

does know GEORGE FUQUA, whom he described as a whiskey hijacker

who, on one occasion about two years ago, hijacked a $1,500

load of whiskey from DL T-4. DL T-4 advised there were two

carloads of whiskey involved, and that only his load was hijacked,

while

the other load,

the property of LEO KINARD, was

not taken.
