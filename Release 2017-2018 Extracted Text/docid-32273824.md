(PURSUANT TO S. RES. 21, 84TH CONGRESS)

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510

May 3, 1976

DI. James B. Rhoads

Archivist of the United States

Seventh and Pennsylvania

Washington, D. C.

Dear Dr. Rhoads:

Dinger

Arrangements have been previously made for

Committee staff members Dan Dwyer and James John-

to examine certain materials relating to the

assassination of President Kennedy which are located

at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas.

The purpose of this letter is to add the name

of Committee staff member Michael 1. Epstein to the

list of individuals who need to examine these mater-

ials.

Mr. Epstein and Mr. Dwyer plan to be in

Austin later this week, and Mr. Corcoran of the

Library

staff has asked that we make sure that Mr.

Epstein's name is added to your list.

Both he and

Mr. Dwyer have Top Secret/Compartmented security

clearances.

I would appreciate it if you would com-

municate this information by telephone to Mr. Corcoran

so that there will be no delay when Mr. Epstein and

Mr. Dwyer arrive.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Willan 6. Miller

William G. Miller

Staff Director
