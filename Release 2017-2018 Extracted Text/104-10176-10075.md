SUBJECT

: Operational Approval for LITAMIL 9

The Provisional Operational Approval for LITAUIL-9

(C-101331) is due to expire 8 January 1965.

In discussions with the field case officer for this

operation, VH/1/Mexico

has found that there is no way to

when, or whether, LITAMIL9 will again leave Cuba.

For reasons of

personal security, LITAUil9 has not been

able to function as a repulling auuro dini:= =112= +o

early March 1965.

Letters to his brother, LITAMIL 17,

and reports fron occasional Cuban official travelers transiting

Mexico indicate that LITAVIL-9 is well and is employed by the

National Cultural Council.

LITAXIL-9 is not an inactive agent.

The Station

has recently proposed that his

salary cease accumulating

ag of 30 June 1966.

If and when be again manages to leave

Cuba, he

will be contacted and a full assessmeut of his

future usefulness will be nade.

Owing to the lact that his

sister-in-law is a secretary to Fidel Castro it is expected

that be ill be a valuable source of information, at leat

for an initial debriefing period.

It would be appreciated if the POd or LITAMIL-9

could be extended for six months.

If at the end of that

time he has not left Cuba, it will be proposed that thes

POA be allowed to expire.

Operational Approval for LITANILg

1. An Operational Approval is requested for LITAJIL9,

The Station has expressed its

reluctance to interview a lexican officer who alleged in

1959 that LITAJIL-9 was a Corunist, since this course of

action would unnecessarily draw attention of this officer

to our interest in LITAMIL9.

Will has concurred in this

decision, and considers that this unevaluated derogatory

2 mEan4201

LITANIED 15 tan sutredoned by tie pendea

mance record.

Realizing the risk involved in working with any

Cuban national, WH/1 feels that LITAJIL9's excellent record

of cooperation, plus his acceptance of the idea of continued

cooperation in a denicd area favor consideration of an

Operational Approval.

Additionally,

we have had audio

coverage through the telephone in LITANILg's office for

the past two yeals or more, and during this time the Station

has used the installation for spot checking his information,

and is satisfied that there are no reasons to question his

veracity and security or suspect that he is under control

of the Cuban service.

Attached for your review are several contact

reports of LITAMIL9,

as requested by dir. Lally.

prompt return will be appreciated.

This office will be

to cooperate in any further revier of this case

which will facilitate the OA.

MDIORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: LITAKIL-9, Report of IDY,

During 21-26 February 1963,

travalled from Headquartera to Mexico City on TDY to train

on various clandestine, operational, techniques,

pon arrival in Mexico City

that LIAHlug logodly became of moral improm certained

unvalling to roceive tralning and also untilling to accent the

SY syutaos Headquarters

had iseved for his,

and which

had carried to Mexico City.

Neverthe'ess, PARIERS set LIThIIL-9

three tires to determine the agants precise objections and to

overcome then if possible. Although the agents general

resintance was not avaroomo.

DARUERS AlA FAUTON WITS TITANTIA

clandestine wethods and techniques in a general way.

2.

The first meeting was held at the Station case

officers home, with the Case Officer present.

LITAYIL-9 ex-

plained

his reasons for refumine to be trained and for ..ot

being willing to cornunicate in SW with FUBARK while in Cuba.

Generally LITANIL-I claimed that be le very norvous, and

lucapable of performing clandestine tasks without having a

nervous breakdown and at the san. time getting himsell caugat

in the act because of his general incompetaacy.

Also, LITAKIL-9

was planning to stay at sis brothers

home in Cuba, and felt

It would be unethical

and innoral for him to be cormunicating

clandestinely with KUBARK while accepting

the hospitality of

his brother and sister-in-lar who are ataunch supporters of the

Castro rcaine.

These sareements obvioualy had already been

presented to the Case Officer who had already concluded that

LITAKIL-9 could

not be moved from his position.

The agent

furthernore, felt that there was no need for training of sw

mince he would be returning to Mexico after only three months

In Cuba. He displayed a cable he had just received fros his

father answering LITANIL 9'a query as to what might be bis

next assignent.

The cable stated that LITAMIL-9 would nast

likely return

to his present post in Mexico.. The agent thre

fore felt that upon his return to

Mexico City, he could be

debriefod by his Case Officer.

LITAMIL-9 rejected all attempte

to convince him of our nod for current into from Inuida Cuba.

He was adament when we pointed out that be might not return

to

Mexico CIty &S

hoped, but might havo to remain in Cuba Thaving

no means of contact.

If this happens he plans to ramsa bia

position and return to Mexico an a private citizen, maco he

already 1a a

regintered "resident" of Mexico.

On Friday, 24 February,

spent most of

the day visitinz alone dith titAntid ar une matter e apart-

By the eat of the day LITAMll9 hed softened a little

and had revered some of the personality traits

montioned

below.

LITINIL9 also agreod to

conmunicate with hia Case

Officer through open code in letter to bia brother in Mexic

City.

He alno was willing to meet taaide YUBARK; preferably

1l the contact vas a diplomat but not Cuban.

He agreed to

take a set of cuff links as boon fines.

As a suggestion, be

mentioned that

his friend, The Swiss Ambassador, nor serving

in Madrid, Spaío,

would be

an ideal pontact.

In revealing bow

euch a contact could be performed and in discussing LITAIL 9

modus reveadi ia Cuba,

there

was coneiderablo discussions

concerning operational Security and clandentine procedures

LITAYIL-9 cas apply while in Cuba.

:

LITAMIL during this meeting also presented.

in logical

Bequence, his reasoas for believing

that te

Mexico City.

Restrally. Ho toole that harder theo

fact that be has many contacta in Mexico City (where ho Jas

lived

and vorted for many years) and the fact that his sister-

1n-1aT 1n Cuba has a responsible position with considerablo

Influence in the Castro Government, be LITAXIL-9 will be re

assigned to his present post in M-rico City after three monthe

of leave, consultations, and training in Cuba.

5. The third meeting ocurred in the evening of

25 Februar., ln a car pick up mituation, with the Case Officer

present.

ThiE time, LITAMIL-9 was less villine to consunicate

WIth TUBARS while in Cuba than be had been during the previous

meeting, but with

some reluctance, agreed to the use of open

code and to be contacted by some diplomat.

This meeting.

fore, was a routine operational meeting, with his Case Officer

le charge.

6.

Based upon their three neetings,

fored

the following opinions of LITAXIL-9:

Fic 18 a Barora aspor

tunist, willing to colloborate with XUBARY against the Castro

Goverament, but not to the point where his personal security

in endangered.

Re dimlikes the Castro Regime because it has

fumbled mo badly, and because the current Cuban officiel are

crude and inconpetant.

He greatly adaires the American people,

but definitely. feels that we

own

aro merely concerned about our

national security and well-boing.

LITAMIL 9 Owes bia

firut loyalty to the fine

arts, has little Patriotic feelinen

towarda Cuba, since he has lived 1n Mexico for so many years,

and han declared himself to be a rosident of lexico.

opportunity

personal friende reside.

Although at firet appearance, and according to

his orn opinion statemeats, LITAUIL-9

appears to be extremely

norvous becaume of his clandestine activities in behalt of

KUBARK and agalam Cuba, after some discussion It van apparont

that be actually relishes these clandestine actions that he

would have angaged in then long before he did, and that he

would bave continued a covert relationahip with KUBARK even alter

Castro falls, serving either in Vexico (wers he has many

contacts of Inter:st to KUBARK) or in Cuba 1a

500s pOst In

Bone future governent.

"e bag excellent ragport with hie

present KUBARY case officer.

He statos that as long as KUBARK

remains willing to acceot chat he has defia!t3 personal limi

tations, (since he can perform only those clandestine tasks

related

to his cover and cannot be trained or induced to do

anything else) he will gladly continue collaborating -1th

KUBARE an long as desired.

8.

Actually,

feels that LITAyIL-g rould

do most anything

we

would deatre if XUBARX would someday

establish some control over him.

His preseat rerarks concerning

his moral qual-o are artificial. He has great appreciation

"or BoreroneRs and double play, and oponly admits haviar

engaged 1A LE all sis 115€.

On many occasioss he sinito that

he has accomodared himself to a situation for profit or because

he. knew that he could turn the tables eventually on big ad

Versarles.

When he 1a off-guard he admits to being a cool

operater who can schese and work behind bis adversaries' backs.

shows many sigas of enjoying doing what he does for and

with his present TUBARK case officer.

9.

In summary, although LITAMIl9 did not accept

training or St in the standard sense,

believes that the

agents reluctaace

was based on hig desire to take for risks.

The agent in competent, his moral inhibitioas are probably

fated.

He in convinced that be will return to Merico moon, and

desires to continue serviaz KUBARK if no greater riot 1= 11-

volved.

Since ZCBARK at present has no clear control (monetary

or Ideologieal) over LITANIL-O, It vas difficult to impose

LUBARrE WIll over bis.

But he 1a

very willing to Darform for

KUBARE within the limitations he sats, and if someday ve can

Batinly. some personal need he might have, to bag the pot entiml

of becoming a good controlled agent for KUBARK.

He ln intell-

Igent and by nature ho seers to Instinctively conduct him

clandestine operations in a securo manner.
