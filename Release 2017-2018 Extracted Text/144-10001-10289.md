MIMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Report on Examination of Material

Related to lee Harvey Oswald Case

The undersigned have exanined all the material relating

to the tee Harvey Oswald case provided to us by the warren

Commission and have found no indication that any of the

Itema was used for a cryptographic purpose or for passing

secret information?

a. A detailed examination of the dictlonaries failed

to show any indication that they had been used in connection

with a dictionary code.

b. A review of the letters of all the correspondents

related to the case, as well as of the Oswald Diary and

other documents, provided no suggestion of the use of an

open code.

c. Perforations which suggested the use of a grille

system appeared on two pages of the Russian novel, GLAZA

KOTORYE SPRASHIVAYUE,

"Questioning Eyes". However, the:

manner of perforating only a few letters does not conform

to any krom system. For purposes of further study, we

would like to obtain the original of the novel on long-term

or permanent loan. We believe, nevertheless, that it is most

likely that the letters were cut out for sone purpose

related to Oswald's photographic experiments.

the appearance of the term "micro dots" on page 44

of Lee Oswald's address book aroused our suspicions,

particularly in that it was associated with the address of

the photographic firm where he was once employed. There

was nothing to indicate to us that micro dots were actually

used and we have had to assuna that appropriate technical

tests vere made by the fBI or CIA.

oswald's Soviet made portable radio receiver and

Its associated power supply were examined and tested by

R34 with negative results:

The radio (for purposes of the

tests the power supply was considered an Integral part)

conformed closely to one examined by the British in 1959.

f. The names appearing in lee's and Marina's addresa

books have been checked against NSA files but no COMINT

references have been discovered. Collateral references

held in the files have only confirmed known Information.

A copy of the report is attached.

g.:

In addition to the Information on the addresses

developed in the personality check, a separate study of

NSA address files is being made.

While this study 1s

not yet complete, results have so far been negative and

there is no reason to expect that anything beyond what

the personality check has already turned up will be

discovered.

MEMORANDUM FOR DR. TORDELLA

SUBJECT: Letter for the President's Commission

1. Please note that I have eliminated two items from the origina

Memorandum for the Record on the examination of the Oswald materials.

These are the reference to "micto dots" (paragraph d) and the COMINT

reference in paragraph 1.

I suggest that you informally (possibly by telephone) call the

Commies on attention you appearance of the tem picto dots on

page 44 of Oswald's address book. You might Indicate that this reference

aroused our suspicion but that we do not feel competent to make an

exhaustive examination of the materials for the presence of micro dots -

such examination should be conducted by the PBI or CIA. If micro dots

are actually found, we would be happy to collaborate to the fullest

degree required in the analysis of these dots.

3. I do not believe a statement that we have checked the names

against the NSA files needs to be made since:

8- The results were negative and

It identifies the existence of sensitive COMINI records.

Of course, " we had found something, a positive report would have been

required:

Mr, Amold has reviewed the text of the letter and accepts 4t

as unclassified under the circumstances.

President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy

200 Maryland Avenue N.E.

Washington, D. C. 20002

ATTN: Mr. J. Lee Rankin

General Counsel

Dear Mr. Rankin:

Skilled cryptologists at NSA carefully examined the materials

relating to the log Harvey Oswald case provided by the Warren Cow-

mission. The results are as follows?

8, A detalled examination of the two dictionaries revealed

no indication of their use for cryptographic purposes.

b. In the cortespondence, the Oswald Diary, and the other

documett s examined there were no evidences of the use of any type

of cryptography, to Include the use of an open code.

c. Certain letters had been removed from pages 150 and 152

of the Russian novel, GLAZA KOTORYE SPRASHIVAYUI, "Questioning

Eyes." Eight letters had apparently been cut fron page 152 as follows:

Line 10

Line 11

Ilne 13

Line 16

Ilns 24

Laine 26

Ilne 27

One letter had been removed from page 150; however no significance

1s attributed to the removal of this letter since it corresponds in exact

position to one of the letters removed from page 152, It was con-

cluded that this letter had been accidently removed by the cutting

process applied to page 152 and that its removal resulted from the

appiication of excessive pressure on the cutting tool when the letter

on page 152 was taken out.

The sample is considered too small for any valid conclusions to

be reached as to the purpoges for which the above noted letters were

removed. It is considered most unlikely that this process of letter

removal has any cryptographic implication.

d. The Russian "Tourist" portable radio was examined for

cryptologic evídence. The radio appears to be a normal raceiver and

there

was no evidence of its use for any other purpose.

The names appearing in Lee's and Marina's address

books were checked. No evidence of cryptologic Implication was

found.

Although the results of the examination of the materials provided

by the Commission are essentially negative, further study of these

materials will ba made. It any rasults are obtained, the Commission

will be advised. However, it is considered most unlikely that any

thing beyond what is reported above will be discovered.

Sincerely,

GORDON A. BLAKE

Lleutenant General, USAF

Director
