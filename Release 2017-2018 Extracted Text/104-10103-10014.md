to accept any remuneration matsoever, stating that the

conservatively of

In addition to the above information, the

undersigned discussed various aspecte of the ALASk case,

and in particular, questioned A/1 about ArLASH's frane of

mind and future plans which he may have revealed to A/l

after intrich departed the scene. A/l made several points,

which basically boiled down to the fact that AMASH mag

still not pleased with the support he was getting fron the

usG side.

The vistt with DAINOLD, who acted in the capacity

of a representative of high levels of the Govt concernod

with the Cuban problem, saclefied AMAsh as far as policyy

was concerned, but he was not at all happy with the fact

that he still was not given the technical assistance for

the operational plan as he saw it. A/1 said that AMLASH

dwelt constantiy on this point.

He could not understand

why he was denied certain

anall pieces of equipsent which

promised a final solution to the problem, while, on the

other hand, the USG gave much equipment and money to exile

groups for

their ineffective excursions against Cuban

coastal

targets,

and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date.

A/l stated

I that AMLAS!! now has his feet wet vis-a-vis

cooperating with USG and has accepted the

fact that he will

work profitably: and securely with it. It 1s this that. we

stand to lose with our procrustination..

AMLASH a150

talked about going

to the French terrorist group, the

OAS ,

in order to get the naderials and guidance he noeds.

It'

1s belloved that he was tallied out of this idoa, after the

dangers involved were discussed with AMLASI.

T, With rocord to the radio gear, AMASH stated

that he did

not feel that he wanted to take one in with

hin, particularly. In view of the recent arrests in Cuba

of agents carrying concealed radios. He was not opposed,

however, at this time to having a radio cached for him,

to be recovered by hiu later.

8.

According to AMIIIP, if there 1s any interest

in having ALASI link up with other trusted assets in

Cuba, these names would have to be given to him before he

returned; otherwise he rould not trust any other meane

need

later inside to get hin to inltiate or respond to such

contacts.

A/l stated that AMASH talked about getting

at least ciscussing his position, pitu

However he stated that he questioned whether

this was the best idea, since if RAY came to Paris while

he (LASH) nas thore, people would conclude that there was

sonothing between the two,. Another spot would be better;

thought AMLASH.

10. At the time of A/l's departure, AMLASHI

said that he would contact "Jack" (Red stent, Paris

statior) upon his return to Paris. (This he subsequently

did on the loth of November, according to info received

fron Paris-somewhat belatedly).

11.

When ArRASIl, A/l, and VENEGAS were together

in fome and Italy, VINEGAS

told ANLASH that people were

betting that LASHl would not return to Cuba.: Some hed also

questioned his nother on this point. AlASh reportedly

told VENEGAS to cover all the bets he could as he would

be a rich nan. (It das at this time, according to A/l,

that AMASh decided that he had better return to lavana

little sooner than he intoded, in fact almost as soon

as possible.)

12.

ANTASIl talked

about the two possibilities

of re-toking

Cuba - either thru invasion by US troops, or

his ray.

He also realized, however,

that invasion was

not to be considered serously at this tine. Also, AMLASIL

talked about his ability to take some men into the hills

of. Las Villas Province and taking the smell towns of

Trinivad nud Topes de Collantes.

He said that he and his

men could last no more than l5 days in the hills as the

onti-guerrilla fighters now employed by the Regime were

thombotves and knew the way to fight and

the hilla.

ked the Soviet equipent made the govt

forces much bore

fornidable than in Batista's time.

AMLASI

apparently was discussing those ideas with the impression

that this

was the way to set up a provisional rebel sovt

and thereby invite and rain US support,

By the way A/)

talked, it is tairly certain that AMASH realized that

this was not the kind of a plan wich could even remotely

be expected.

to receive USC aid. It 1a hoped that he

does realize that javana must firet be taken... or failing

that, a truely sizablo niece of land (say, almost an '

entire province) which could be a true rallying point and

staging ground under conplete Rebel control, from which

the rost of the island could be wrested from the Fidelietas

and the Communists.

13.

In sunnary, the talke with A/l led the

undersigned

to believe that AMlSIl is again entering

one of his skeptical

woods, one which our aotions have

done little to dispel.

Too little and too 1ato.......
