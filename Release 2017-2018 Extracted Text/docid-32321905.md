Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act

of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The Act established the Assassination Records Review

Board (ARAB) to oversee the governments' production and

compliance with the Act.

The ARAB reviews the proposed

postponements in documents sent by each agency to the National

Archive and Records Administration (NAIA) and decides what

postponements the Act allows or opens the document in full.

ARAB's responsibilities include having agencies

search other

subjects and areas to find any additional material not already

identified as assassination records.

The establishment of the

ARAB by the Act also limited the time for their duties to be

accomplished. The ARAB must complete their tasks by September

1997.

With this deadline in mind, the ARAB sent a letter

requesting additional information.

The

Enclosures: ARRB letter requesting material

Details: On March 10, 1997, the ARAB sent a letter to the FBI

setting forth a formal

request to receive and review additional

315

Congress and the American public that all was done to accomplish

the intentions of the Act.

Dallas should conduct a search of its office for the

listed items. If Dallas is aware of any administrative records

they may have maintained outside the normal index system, they

should include those areas in the search.

If any documents

related to the matter are found, please forward the documents to

the JFK Task Force.
