DETAILS: Navarrete has been a central figure in the intrigue

surrounding

the bombing of captioned Cubana airliner.

He is a

former Miami informant who has been an unpaid confidential source

of Legat, Caracas: As an official of DISIP, Navarrete was

responsible for the care and debriefing of Orlando Bosch Avila,

an anti-Castro terrorist who had sought refuge in Venezuela and

is now being held in connection with the Cubana bombing.

Navarrete has provided information obtained from Bosch to

Legat, Caracas, including the allegation that Guillermo anc

Ignacio Novo were responsible for the murder of Orlando Letelier

former Chilean official in Washington, D. C., on 9/21/76.G 4)

As evidence mounted that the Cubana bomb plot was hatched

in Venezuela and that a number of present and former Venezuelan

officials were implicated, Navarrete went on the offensive and

attempted to discredit CIA, FBI and the American Government

a Dade County, Florida, organized crime officer traveled to

Caracas to persuade Navarrete to testify in the Florida trial of

anti-Castro bomb figure Rolando Otero.

Diaz confidentially advised

our Miami Office that he was

told by Navarrete that Navarrete

participated in two meetings in Caracas at which plans to

bomb a Cubana airliner were discussed. Navarrete also related

that if Luis Posada, one of the persons arrested in connection with

the bomb plot,

were to talk then he (Navarrete) and others would go

"down the tube" in a Venezuelan styled Watergate. Navarrete became

an embarrassment to the Venezuelan Government after forcing

three American journalists to leave Venezuela on. 10/21/76.

Venezuela now denies the existence of Navarrete and Navarrete is

reported to have called his Miami,

her not to call as

Florida

girlfriend and told

"he does not exist. "(R)U)

By teletype 11/4/76, Legat, Caracas

advised that

Navarrete desired to meet with Legat on 11/4/16, but was unable

to keep the appointment indicating that he was being held against

that he had a lot to tell Legat but could not talk over the

phone and that he was

Navarrete

person was

name "Remberto. " (» (U/

period that Posada was a member of that organization. Legat did

not know what cryptic comments of Navarrete meant but no

elaboration waV!

Legat believed Navarrete is being kept in seclusion, and

that he may

Legat/

speculated that if Navarrete returns to the

United States he may be able to shed light on Cubana bombing and

Letelier's assassination. daU

In another development Raul Diaz,

supra, received a

elephone call from Navarrete late on 11/3/76. In this call

Navarrete alleged "that the CORU meeting in the Dominican

Republic was sponsored by the CIA."

CORU is an anti-Castro.

terrorist group which has taken credit for numerous terrorist

acts throughout the Caribbean since June, 1976. CORU was formed

as an umbrella organization at a June, 1976, meeting in the

Dominican Republic attended by five anti-Castro terrorist groups.

It is believed that Navarrete was refering to this meeting.(f-(u)

In this telephone call Navarrete aso told Diaz that if

George Gomez, Alfredo Chumaceiro and Armand Santana were out of

jail at the time of the Letelier bombing then they were

responsible for it. If these men were in jail, according to

Navarrete, then two of their associates perpetrated the Letelier

bombing.

Government never gathered steam. *He is currently on
