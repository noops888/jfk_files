In reference to the verification of the birth of the

subjeet

as shown in the report of SA JAMES J: FILES dated

December 26, 1957 at Chicago:

Investigator JOHN. J.. BURKE, Immigration and Naturalization

Service: (INS), Chicago,

advised that he concluded that SAMUEL

GIANCANA was

born at Chicago,

Illinois on May 24, 1908, based

on birth certificate 5915 and Baptismal records of Holy

Guardian Angel Church.

These records both reflect the

birth of a son to the subjeet's parents on May 24, 1908.

Even though there is a discrepancy in the names, BURKE

believes this discrepancy arose from the fact that the

birth certificate was filed by

a midwife some time after

the event.

The delayed certificate filed by the subject in 1957,

also varies, but BURKE pointed out that a routine check

of the Bureau of Vital Statisties records at Chicago would

not have disclosed certificate 5919 and that undoubtedly

subject's lawyer located this only after having submitted

affidavits supporting the delayed certificate.

advised that INS has closed its deportation case on the

strength of the above verification of birth.

Arrangements have been made to monitor the account

of the subject at the Oak Park National Bank on a monthly

basis.

Regarding information furnished by CG 5951-0 in

May, 1954, as

was reported in re report under the caption

1'=9 on page 15, this informant was recontacted by SA 'ROBERI

J. DENEEN

on February 7, 1958.

She advised that in using

the word "syndicate" when discussing the positions of TONY

ACCARDO, TONY CAPEZIO and SAM GIANCANA in May, 1954,

could have had in mind no more exact meaning than

that which

That is simply that

The informant stated the use

of the

work "syndicate"

was not meant to indicate that she

to each member.

She

stated that underworld characters now

seldom use the term "syndicate".

When referring to the

undefined

powers in vice in the Chicago area, they currently

speak of "the outfit".

A copy of this report is submitted to the Los Angeles

Office since a lead is outstanding in that division and

FRANK FERRARA, who subject reportedly visited in Los Angeles,

reportedly now lives in Chicago.

A copy is submitted to the Miami Office for information,

inasmuch

as leads are outstanding in that division, and
