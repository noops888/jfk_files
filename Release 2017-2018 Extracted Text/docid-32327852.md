He served as manager of this club for about four or live

weeks, until the club folded and went into bankruptcy.

During

this perioa, SALLY BURNS contributed a total of approximately

$13,000 to the operation of the club and he, TONY, personally

contributed close to $30,000 which he had been able to

borrow from close friends.

While the club was in operation, BURNS gave the

indication that the $B, 000.00 contribution was an investment

in this venture. However,

when the club went into bankruptcy,

BURNS informed TONY that he was responsible for the $13000.00

as a personal loan from BURNS.

Again, BURNS began demands on

TONY not

only for the $13.000.00, but

for exhorbitant interest

on this

"loan" which, as of September, 1958, amounted

to a total of approximately $16,000.

Though BURNS took no active part in managing

this club, he was often there during the evening hours, as

of his underlings, specifically the individuals

referred to previously as BABE, CHICK and BUDDY.

Part of the $13,000 contributed by BURNS was,

according to TONY, raised in the following manner:

At a particular time when TONY was having

difficulty making the payroll, BURNS instructed him to

accompany JOE QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey, where they were

to pick up $2500.00 from RAY (previously mentioned as having

been in the office of VITO GENOVESE on Thompson Street). TONY

accompanied QUAGLIARELLO tO New Jersey to a roadside club

le meet

NY T-7 further advised the roadside club where

Following the closing of the Cafe De Paris,

TONY's only contacts with BURNS and his element have been

at times when BURNS has demanded payment, plus interest,

on the $13000.00 he put into this club.

At one time, during early 1958, while TONY!

was with BURNS at a tavern in Atlantic Beach, Long Island,

New York, an Individual identified by BURNS as Mr. JOHN

ORMENTO came over to their table and said "Hello"

one to the zae atted

to BURNS

on his way out of the tavern.

This appeared to be a chance

meeting and there was no discussion between BURNS and this

individual.

While in Havana, Cuba, on one of his visits to

GEORGE LEVINE, LEVINE Introduced TONY to a casino manager

identified as JOE RIVERS, with whom LEVINE appeared to be

quite friendly.

• NY T-7 was recontacted on October 15, 1958,

and advised that during one of TONY's visits to Havana, Cuba,

auring 1957, previously discussed, TONY met an American named

LOWELL BIRRELL, who frequested the Oriental Park Racetrack

near Havana, which was operated by GRANELLO and LEVINE.. The

informant related that BIRRELL was a New York City lawyer who

was in trouble with the United States Government in connection

with large scale stock manipulations and BIRRELL was reportedly

in Havana at the time to avoid Investigation or prosecution

in connection with the matter.

The informant related that it was his impression

that BIRRELL seemed to be in close contact with the interests

of GRANELLO and LEVINE in Cuba.

He stated that in relation to

the stock issued in the Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana,

originally the stock had been placed on the market at about

twenty cents per share and that during a comparatively short

time, the stock rose to around a $1.50 per share. The informant

stated that LEVINE and GRANELIO were reported to have made a

"killing" on the manioulation of this racetrack stock. The

Informant advised further that it would not be surprising 1f

BIRRELL had a hand in the above manipulation.
