On 10/13/64

informant advised that he received

a subpoena on 10/12/64 dated 10/7/64 ordering him to appear

at Miami on 10/20/64 as a witness in the FELIX ANTHONY

ÁLDERISIO, et al case.

He advised that he is certain that

if he appears in Federal Court in Miami and is seen by

ALDERISIO, his life as well as his family's will be in jeopardy.

On 10/14/64, he advised that he called Mr. KENNEY,

Departmental Attorney in Miami on the morning of 10/14/64 and

pleaded with him, mostly on the basis that his absence

will result in the ruination of his business; not because

of his fear because he thought that would open up questions.

KENNEY told him to be in Miami on 10/20/64.

It is noted that Miami airtel to the Bureau dated

10/9/64,

captioned FELIX ANTHONY ALDERISIO, et al, advised

that the trial date has been reset for the week of 10/26/64

and will probably not commence before 10/29/64.

Informant has stated that he intends to appear

at Miami on 10/20/64 as ordered by the subpoena.

Miami is requested to determine if informant

should appear on 10/20/64 as set out in the subpoena or possibly.

at a later

date. If there is any possibility that informant

need not appear

in view of the fact that he feels his life

is in jeopardy,

Miani should advise the Los Angeles Office.
