CUBA

MOVEMENT OF PROPAGANDA MATERIALS

I.

Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede

the movement of Communist propaganda materials from Cuba

to and within Latin American countries. Actions contemplated

to control the movement of propaganda are closely related to,

and in some cases identical with, those which control the

movement of persons. As in the program which addresses

the problem of movement of subversive trainees to and from

Cuba, the successful execution of the proposals will materially

reduce the flow of propaganda, but will not eliminate it

entirely.

Communist Cuba has many legitimate outlets through

which propaganda materials flow. By eliminating these out-

lets, and by physically isolating Cuba from the remainder

of Latin America, Communist propagandists and their sympa-

thizers will be forced to rely more heavily upon production

and dissemination of propaganda materials in a clandestine

environment within each Latin American country, with a

consequent increase in difficulty.

II. Nature and Scope of the Problem

While the Castro Image has probably diminished in

Latin America, by virtue of his own imprudent actions, the

susceptibility of the Latin American people to communist

propaganda remains high. The basic social and economic

factors which have made this so in the past have not greatly

changed, and the variety and quantity of propaganda materials

with which the Latin Americans are beset is impressive, as

examplified in the

million dollars which the

communists are reported as investing in the project annually.

The program presents a continuing threat to the tranquility. of

Latin America.

For the purpose of this paper, propaganda materials

Include radio program scripts, tapes and recordings, printed

materials, (posters, pamphlets, magazines, leaflets, books,

newspapers, news service output), motion pictures, duplicating

or reproducing equipment, electronic communications equipment,

spare parts and supplies therefor and printing resources,

particularly paper stockpiles. To be complete, moreover,

"movement of propaganda materials" must exterd to small

quantities, of selected publications which are hand-carried

into a country by legal or 1llegal travellers for subsequent

reproduction. It also includes materials transmitted through

Cuban and Soviet Bloc diplomatic installations, shipments

via postal channels, quantities introduced through smuggling

operations, oral transmission of propaganda guidelines by

individual travelers or by Radio Havana, and the dissemination

of slanted news by Prensa Latina, the official Cuban news

agency, for pick-up and reproduction by local outlets.

Finally to be considered is thematic guidance which can

be exploited locally by returning trainees, front groups

and sympathetic publications; and in some countries such as

Mexico, Argentina and Uruguay, the products of those commercial

establishments which regularly print or broadcast pro-Castro

materials as a matter of police or ideological conviction.

Press and Publications

There are 326 Communist and pro-Communist newspapers

and periodicals in Latin America. Infiltration of the

democratic press and the non-critical attitudes of some

newspapermen help give wider diffusion of the Cuban propaganda

Iine. In addition, there are 228 communist oriented publish-

Ing houses and bookstores which serve as outlets for 30

different Cuban periodicals and other Communist books in all

Latin American countries except Dominican Republic, Paraguay,

Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Many of them offer books and

publications at very low prices or give away two or three

books with the purchase of one, and easy credit terms are

available.

Decrees banning Communist activity and propaganda have

not prevented the continued clandestine publication and

distribution of a number of periodicals, books and other

printed materials in come countries, notably Argentina.

Excluding TASS and New China News Agency (NCNA) ,

Prensa Latina is the principal Communist news agency in

Latin America. It operates openly, but not entirely without

restriction, In ten countries -- Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,

Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Panama and

Uruguay. Although its users are chiefly leftists or overt

Communists, in some countries there is fairly extensive

unattributed use of Prensa Latina releases, especially in

radio.

Radio

Shortwave radio is the principal direct mass audience

medium available to Cuba to carry subversive propaganda

to Latin America, and extensive use 1s made of It. The Castro

regime has constantly increased Radio Havana's shortwave

broadcasts to Latin America to a total of 115:30 hours per

week. Communists have had little success in placing radio

and television material on local stations in Latin America.

Cultural Activities

Penetration under the guise of "cultural" activities

is a favored Communist propaganda technique in Latin America.

There are 64 binational centers and friendship societies

in the area.

F1lms

Feature films and short documentaries produced by the

Cuban Institute of Motion Picture Art and Industry (ICAIC)

play a direct propaganda role. Their showings have been

focused on binational centers, pro-Communist labor and student

groups, and on private or clandestine meetings.

It will be seen from this brief review that Latin

America is the target of a broad scale propaganda program,

comprising not only propaganda materials but including also

the ideas, the knowledge and the funds which are necessary

to make those materials effective.

III. Direct Actions to Impede Legal Movement of Propaganda

Materials.

Presented below is a summary of actions contemplated

to impede legally executed movement of propaganda materials

from Cuba to and within Latin American countries. For the

purpose of this paper, legal movement is characterized as

movement by recognized private and governmental carriers

and communications, as well as postal systems and diplomatic

pouching.

The following actions offer promise of contributing

to the production of early and effective results in selected

Latin American countries. It is recognized that they do not

necessarily have universal application and that those which

are effective in one country may not be feasible in another.

1. Political Actions

a. Induce the countries In which Prensa Latina

operates to limit or exclude its activities.

b. Persuade those governments which receive

Cuban and Bloc diplomatic missions to maintain close

surveillance over the propaganda activities of the

## Page 9

SECRET

Communist embassies with a view toward prohibiting

abuses of diplomatic privilege for subversive

purposes.

c. As applicable and feasible, induce Latin

American

countries to:

(1) Adopt adequate internal security legis-

lation which would provide severe penalties for

any person engaging in dissemination of Cuban

Communist propaganda aimed at the overthrcw

of the legal governments by force and violence.

(2) Preclude attendance of Cuban delegates

to international meetings held in Latin America.

(Delegates are propaganda disseminators.)

2. Intelligence Actions

a. Continue U.S. intelligence efforts in each

country to identify irdividuals, organizations and

facilities involved in propaganda importation, repro-

duction and/or dissemination; make available to each

country selected intelligence concerning these individuals,

organizations and their activities.

b. Encourage each country not having a legal

Communist Party to offer rewards for information lead-

ing to interception of Castro Communist propaganda

materials considered dangerous to the country's tran-

quility.

c. In separate diplomatic approaches to each

country, urge full

and effective cooperation with the

appropriate organs. of the OAS, and bilaterally among

the several nations, in the interchange of information

concerning movement of propaganda materials.

d. Persuade Latin American countries to report

promptly to the diplomatic mission of the country

concerned, the identity of any national of that

country who arrives from Cuba and who is discovered

to have been carrying propaganda materials.

3. Covert Actions

a. Cause disruption in the reproduction and

distribution of propaganda materials, and in the

procurement and delivery of related supplies and

equipment.

e. Dissuade U.S. and local businessmen and firms

from advertising in Latin American media which carry

pro-Communist materials; prepare and circulate to U.S.

f1rms, for information, lists of such media in order

to encourage their support of a non-Communist press.

I. Inhibit the spread of Cuban Friendship Societies

in Latin America by an active program to expose their

subversive activities and objectives.

g. Subsidize non-Communist newspapers or press

services in order to make them economically competitive

with papers served by Prensa Latina and TASS in Latin

America.

4. Military Assistance Action

Complete and distribute, through U.S. Military

Groups, printed material and film strips on the

realities of Communist propaganda, for use in Latin

American troop education programs.

IV. Direct Actions to Impede Illegal Movement of Propaganda

Material.

As the actions outlined in the preceding sections become

effective, movement of propaganda materials will be forced

SECRET

Into clandestine channels. Although many of the actions

outlined in Section III will serve to restrict 1llegal

movement, additional measures to impede this clandestine

traffic will acquire increasing importance.

1. Intelligence Actions

a. Use penetration and other intelligence techniques

to identify efforts to move propaganda materials from

Cuba to and/or within Latin American countries; determine

routes and methods employed; report selected information,

consistent with requirements for protecting our own

Intelligence program, to governments concerned.

b. Utilize U.S. intelligence capabilities to

determine the nature and extent of clandestine air

craft and small boat traffic between Cuba and other

countries in the Caribbean area, with special attention

to Mexico, Honduras, Jamaica, Haiti and Dominican

Republic. Use the evidence obtained to induce govern-

ments concerned to initiate surveillance and other

control measures aimed at interception of propaganda

materials.

2. Surveillance and Reporting Action

Exploit the mechanism of the Caribbean surveillance

system approved in the study on movement of personnel,

for discovering and Impeding the movement of propaganda

materials by Illicit means.

3. Political Action

Where legally feasible to do so, induce each Latin

American country to improve police measures to seek and

destroy the subversive Communist propaganda apparatus

in that country, and to detect and eliminate corrupt

officials who permit illicit shipment of propaganda

materials.

4. Technical Assistance Action

a. Provide technical assistance to enable local

officials to locate clandestine transmitters.

b. Assist Latin American governments, which so

desire, to develop a jamming capability against radio

broadcasts..

5. Military Action

Assist in the accelerated improvement of Latin

American internal security forces and police forces,

especially patrol and intelligence activities aimed

at preventing clandestine propaganda activities.

Provide equipment, training and advice

as required.
