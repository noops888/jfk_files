CIA OPERATIONS: - MIAMI AREA

On July 1, 1962, the following information was

furnished by MM 639-S, who is active in Cuban revolution-

ary activities and who has furnished reliable information

in the past:

p. 3

During the latter part of february, 1962,

members of the 30th of November Movement, an

anti-CASTRO

organization, met in Miami with THEODORE RACOOSIN, who

was understood to be President of the International Broad-

casting Company, New York City, and MI. WILLIAM HILLMAN,

who was understood to be head of Radio Free Durope. The

30ch of November people believed that these men, because

of cheir positions, might be able to assist their organiza

tion in obtaining United States Government backing in the a

arms, and training camps.

The informant,

who was associated with members of the 30th of November

Movement at that time, learned that these men did not

promise any help to the Cubans they met with, but coun

selled them to write to the Secretary of State, should

Ithey desice any help, or have any complaints.

approximately three days in this area, RACOOSIN and HILLMAN

departed.

Nothing further was heard of or from these men

for several months, and their visit appeared to have no

significance.

Subsequently, on June 22, 1962, RACOOSIN

telephoned the informant from New York City and said

he intended to come to Miami. He said he wanted to

talk with the informant and "the Miami representative of

President KENNEDY." He did not further identify "the

¿Miami representative of President KENNEDY."

On the same day, June 22, 1952, WILLIAM BAGES,

editor of the "Miami Daily News," telephoned the informant's

residence and asked if RACOOSIN

was there.

The informant

was unaware as to why BAGGS thought RACODSIN might be at

his residence, denied he was there, but said he would try

to contact RACOOSIN.

The informant thereafter telephoned

RACOOSIN in New York and asked if it was satisfactory to

give BAGGS his phone number in New York. RACOOSIN said

this was satisfactory.

The informant thereafter called

BAGGS back and gave him the number.

According to the

informant, it was apparent that BAGGS and RACOOSIN, up

until

this time, had never met.

RACOOSIN arrived in Miami on June 29, 1962

and contacted the informant on June SOth, stating that

White House representatives, not further identified,

had contacted him and asked him to go to Miami and contact

President KENNEDY's representative, WILLIAM BAGGS, editor

¡of the "Miami Daily News."

RACOOSIN said that the White House doubted chat

CIA was giving the true picture concerning Cuban natters,

and that CIA head MC CONE was responsible fos this.
