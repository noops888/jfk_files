MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with Gordon Novel

Gordon Novel called the New Orleans office on 13 August 1981.

Ronald Farris was away on Annual Leave and had arranged to have his calls

forwarded automatically to the Houston Field Office's listed telephone

number.

When the call was answered with the Houston number, Novel indi-

cated that he was calling the New Orleans office.

He was told that Farris

was out of the office for a week and his calls were being relayed to

Houston.

Novel asked how he would go about obtaining his personal Agency

file under the Freedom of Information Act.

He was told that he should

address a letter to Freedom of Information Coordinator with his request.

He then indicated that he had done this already, and the information sent

to him was so severely edited and sanitized that it was difficult to make

sense of it. He did, however, discover. that it contained information that

was erroneous

and he asked how to go about refuting the misinformation

and/or correcting the file. It was suggested that he write a letter

detailing the discrepancies and request that a change be made.

He did

not seem

interested in doing that and promptly changed his line of

questioning.

He asked how he would go about contacting the Director of

the Agency directly. He was told that he should use the local represent-

ative, Mr. Farris, to relay any information he might wish to get to the

Director. : Novel

indicated that he had only talked to Farris once, but

was anxious to bypass the usual channels to avoid having his information

mishandled or misconstrued. He was told that Farris was a highly qualified

representative of the. Agency and the proper individual to contact regarding

information he wished to get to the Director's attention. He gave a small

sinister chuckle and replied, "We'll see about

i that," then hung up.

SUBJECT

: Pending Litigation - Gordon Novel

1.

Gordon Novel is a somewhat notorious figure

who

first came to the attention of this

Agency during the

- Garrision

Investigation into the assassination of

President Kennedy. From time to time he has claimedto

be a CIA employee or to be acting on behalf of the CIA.

He has never been employed by the Agency and has had no

contacts with the Agency except for occasional visits

to

Domestic Collection Division offices.

He has been in

several scrapes with the law, most recently in October

1976 when he was on trial for conspiracy to firebomb

several buildings in New Orleans.

Mr. Novel has now

filed a civil suit claiming alleged violations of his

rights and interference with his personal affairs.

He

is not suing the Agency but he has named Mr. Howard

Osborn as a defendant.

Mr. Osborn has been

in touch with

the Office of General Counsel seeking representation by

the Justice Department since he feels his being named in

the suit probably resulted from his official duties with

the Agency.

2.

On 27 April 1977 Mr. George Jameson of the

Office of General Counsel contacted the undersigned to

inquire whether we had a file on Novel and if the file

showed any reason why Mr. Novel should have named

Mr. Osborn as a defendant in the suit.

Mr. Jameson was

given a rundown on the nature of the information in

Novel's file and was also provided with Mr. Osborn's

retirement date, t February 194.

Mr. Jameson mentioned

that most of the

alleged activities complained about by

## Page 15

CONHDENTIAL

Novel occurred in 1975 and there is no apparent reason

for Novel having singled out Mr. Osborn as a defendant.

Mr. Jameson also requested traces on two individuals

these individuals.

3.

Mr. Jameson indicated that we would probably

be receiving.

a formal request for pertinent information

as this case

develops, but he merely needed a preliminary

reading in order to determine if Mr.. Osborn should be

defended by the Department of Justice in this litigation.

Aside from indexing the names of Blanscett and Pfiffer to

Novel's file, no further action is contemplated by the

undersigned.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM

SUBJECT

John K. Greaney

Associate General Counsel

: Gordon Dwane Novel

1. Gordon Novel is scheduled for rosecution in New Orleans

on 27 October on charges stemming from = conspiracy to firebomb some

buildings on Canal Street. He was mentioned extensively in the James

Garrison investigation of the Kennnedy assassination in 1967. Subse-

quently, Novel filed suit against Garriso= and later against Playboy

Magazine for an article they published wich identified Novel as a CIA

employee. In 1969 the Agency submitted a certificate signed by the then

Director of Personnel, Robert S. Wattles, which certified that Gordon Novel

had never been employed by the CIA (cc=y attached). It may be necessary

to submit a new certificate for the upcoring tial in New Orleans. You

are requested to search your files to determine whether there is any

record of employment.

2. There are two additional deferse witnesses that we would

appreciate a search as to any employment relationship:

(a) Lawrence B. Rohde

530 "N" Street, S.W.

Washington, D.C

Employed by: Commont ealth Pug Corporation

It is my understanding that these names have all been traced as a request

from the Domestic Collection Division with negative results. However, I

would appreciate a written response to those traces by close of business

20 October so that certificates can be prepared.

3. It is possible that a witness from the Office of Personnel may be

required to appear in New Orleans as a rebuttal witness to testify that

there was no employment relationship with Gordon Dwane Novel, but this

is subject to negotiation with the prosecutor.

In channel o's news broadcast at 6-6:30 PM, Saturday, 25 March 1967,

choloca newscaster announced that NOC had

interviewed him in "Washingion." The film then switched to a front view

of Novel scared in an armchair and showing him

answering questions posed

by somsone off comera.

The latter äsked if. Garrison had promised

Novel brything in exchange for his testimony.

Novel said that Garrison

had asked him if he needed money and had volunteered to give him whatever

financial assistance he needed. (b): The interviewer asked what was

Garrison's motive in prosecuting the case.. Novel eventually said that

it

was purely political.

But before that, he said that Garrison reminded

viavor askod this question a second time, couching it in somewhat different

terms

"wat did Garrison hope to accomplish, what was his motive.: Novel

said that that was a matier of conjunction (conjecture), that he might

At the conclusion of the Washington interview, the film returned to

local newscaster. The latter stated that NEC had informed the NO

scation that Novel had submitted to a polygraph test in connection with

the interview and "had passed it."

The attached clippings from the 26

and 27: March issues of the Times-

Picayune do not mention the substance of the NBC interview.: These articles

REFERENCES

: Domestic Collections Division Memoranda

dated 25 February 1976 & 1 March 1976

1. According to the referenced Domestic Collections

•Division (DCD) memoranda, the New Orleans DCD Office had con-

sidered proposals: from Subject in October 1975 and on

9 February 1976 which were rejected.

During the last contact,

the DCD representative requested Subject not contact him again.

2. DCD requested Office of General Counsel (OGC) guidance

if they should be contacted by the press concerning Subject's

arrest for conspiring to detonatesincendiary devices in a down-

town New Orleans building.

OGC recommended that they acknowledge

receiving a proposal from Novel which had been rejected. DCD

was also informed that Subject had never been employed by the

Agency, with the understanding that this might also be made

known to any inquiring reporters or United States Attorney?.

DCD stated that they were pleased with this guidance, since

iballowed them to respond candidly to any immediate inquiries

and also serves to disassociate the Agency from the difficulties

in which Subject now finds himself.

It appears that the only

action taken in this case is the OGC guidance supplied to DCD

and the only CIA interest in Subject is based on his contact

with the New Orleans DCD Office..

CIA Association

REE

(a) N0-39-76 dated 20 February 1976, Subject: Gordon Novel

Watts Telecon of 24 Februasy 1976, Same Subject

3

The US Attorney in New Orleans, Gerald Gallinghouse, called

the New Orleans Resident Office on 24 February 1276, to advise me that

Gordon M. D. Novel had been arrested by agents of the US Alcohol, Tobacco

and Firearms Bureau (AIY) for conspiring to detonate incendiaxy devices

In a downtown New Orleans building on Mardi Gras, 2 March 1976- Novel

had apparently described such a plot in a conversation he unwittingly

hold with an undercover tr agent.

2. I confirmed to Gallinghouse that I had had a rumber of contacts

with Novel since October 1975 concerning a proposal which Novel had offered

for CIA consideration. : I told Callinghousa that the proposal had been re-

jected by the Agency, but that I had again seen Novel on 9. February 1976

to accept additional material in support of his proposal.

At that time,

I also asked lovel not to contact me again.. I assured Gallinghouse that

at Bo time had Novel been an Agency employee, not had he ever bad any

fornal relationship with the Agency. Gallinghouse thanked me for ex-

plaining the nature of our relationship with Novel, and he suggested

that he might recontact me later 1f necessary for nora details.

3.

to the referent tolecon, I briefed the Deputy Chief of Operations,

Ed Watts, on the development and asked him how I should respond lf Galling-

house sought acceas to the office file on Fovel. Mi. Watts recommended that

I try to avoid giving the US Attorney direct access to the file, but that

11 Callinghouse should ask to xeview the file, I should refer the request

to Headruarters for resolution,

4s. Mrs. Gordon Novel called shortly after my conversation with

Messrs. Gallinghouse and Hatts.

She said that her huaband had asked

her to call no to insure that federal autborities vere aware that bex

husband had been actively discussing a proposal for the Agency with me.

Mrs. Novel said that her husband had been denied boud, and that he hoped

his contacts with a DOD officer night somehow convince federal authorities

that he could be safely released on bond after all. Otherwise, she said,

he might be detained through the Mardi Gras holiday as a precsution. She

sosured me that Novel had nade no effort to persuade the authoritles that

he is a CIA officer or employee.

"The court documents also claim that

although Novel was unaware. Grafton

was an undercover federal agent, he

tried to hire Grafton for the plan at

$1,600 and a year's free rent in an apart-

ment.

Reportedly, Novel and two other men

were supposed to meet with Gov, Edwin

Edwards last Saturday in Baton Rouge

to discuss the possibilities of getting a

world's fair for New Orleans.

*I had a luncheon scheduled (last)

Saturday at the mansion with some peo-

ple to talk about thie exposition," the

governor said.

"But the name Novel

doesn't ring a bell.

"Only one man showed up Saturday.

He said the others couldn't make it and

asked if we could re-schedule the meet-

w: ing. I didn't even ask why they couldn't

make it.

An aide to the governor said the gover-

nor's office was trying to determine if

one of the three men was Novel.

He said records of the appointment

show only the time and subject matter of

the meeting.

The aide added that Novel may have

been one of the three, but he could not be

certain.

According to the documents, the ATF®

Bureau received information "from a

confideritial informant" of the alleged

plan.

Grafton, posing as a prospective "hit

man," made arrangements to discuss

the plans with Novel on Feb. 4.

The affidavit for a; search warrant

signed by Johannesen … said Grafton

was told by Novel that Novel "had

several buildings he wanted destroyed in

the New Orleans, La. area...

The papers also show that on Feb. f,

Grafton met Novel at Novel's home, 1718

Lakeshore Drive, where Novel allegedly

said "he had made a firebomb for an

individual to burn the first building he

wanted destroyed, but that man failed to.-

The identity of that person was not re-

vealed in the documents.

Novel said he had a few problems

with some of the properly located within

the (downtown) project area and that

wa's where Grafton would come

in .

* according to the affidavit.

The documents showed that Grafton

met Novel again al his Plaza Tower of-

fice on Feb. 11d the two "discussed

the firebombing

five buildings within

the downtown area."

At that time, according to the docu-

ments, Novel allegedly showed Grafton

the equipment as well as what Novel

supposedly described as "'legal wire-

tapping equipment:"

At that meeting, the papers claim.

Novel allegedly agreed to give Graiton

"the contract"' to destroy the live bulld-

ings:

That same day, the documents indi-

cate. Novel supposedly pointed out the

first huding targeted for the alleged at-

tack, and later look Gralton to "the

building located beiween St. Charles and

Camp Street.*

According (o the papers. Novel al.

legedly explained to Grafton "how

difficult it would be to get inside the

building:

• 88

At another meeting Feb. 13 between

the two in Novel's office, the documents

said, Novel drew a diagram of the first

targeted building which was described

as being "accross the street from One

Shell Square."

Presumably. that building was the

Greater Federation of Churches Build-

ing

•On that same date, the records allege,

Novel told Grafton "the fire should be on

the second floor in order for the roof and

floorlo burn completely."

It was then, according to the affidavit,

that Grafton agreed to the plan for $1,000

and the free apartment.

Aceuding to the records, Novel also

presented Grafton a nolebook, contain-

ing "a plan project of approximalely

three blocks near the One Sheil Square

Building™ which was also to be part of

the alleged scheme.

After their series of meetings Novel

was arrested by the ATF agents Feb: 20.

Notel was denied bail the next day

and the gaverment - led by Asst. U.S.

Atty. Al Winters - was granted a mo-

tion that Novel be examined by a psy

chiatristão determine his competency in

the proceedings.

Defense attorney Servando C

"Sonny" Garcia III - a law partner of

Municipal Court Judge Eddie Sapir, has

urged that bond be set for his client.

In documents filed with the court Gar-

cia called Novel "a man well respected

'SUBJECT: Correspondence of Possible Interest to Office of Security

REF

: Durbin/Noble Telecon, 17 July 1975

CLV-121-75

DATE: 17 July 1975

1. On 15 July 1975, an agent of the Cleveland FBI contacted the

Cleveland Resident Office concerning the attached correspondence. The

Bureau had received the letters the same day, and because there were

several references to the Agency, the agent thought that our office

should be informed.

Copies of the correspondence are attached for

your information and retention.

2.

The FBI agent who discussed this matter with us stated that

he had been told that the author of the four-page letter was a

"professional wiretapper"

, had previously been convicted to transporting

Illegal wiretap equipment across state lines (into Nevada), and was

suspected

of illegally obtaining and

selling "classified information".

Cleveland

FBI plans no action at this time other than further in-

vestigatory work on

the individual.

The Cleveland RO plans to do absolutely nothing about this

matter other than forwarding the information to Headquarters.

The

agent was informed of and agreed to this course of action, he was

thanked for his concern and the matter was dropped,

Gentlemen:

Due to the rapidly accelerating national

sensitivity

of my historical personal interests, as well as the

magnitude of political, intelligence and financial involve-

ments for which I am legally responsible to ny associates,

I deen it wise to contaci your office for the following

It 1s inperative that your files be revised in order

to case reflecting purposeful disinformation, slanderous

Irregularities and obvious inconsistencies about my activities.

This data has been maliciously accunulated by your business

and security offices during tho past seven years while

Illegally, Intruding and Interfering In highly sensitive

Industrial and political counterintelligence research in

which I was involved. To accomplish this, 1.

T.& 1. has

used misrepresentation and a

fraudulent legal technicality

covering

anticipated" financial loss to the phone company.

(My phone bills have always been paid promptly.)

The police tactics used by your offices--harrassnent,

Intimidation,

threats, extortionary denands- have been

verified throughout jexas and in Washington, D. C. however,

the highly sensitive nature of the work in which we are

currently Involved could, concelvably, pose a threat to

naitonal security because of this invasion of privacy where

our phone calls are concerned.

Immediately.

Relative to the recent meeting in my private study

at my Dallas

July 2, 1975, I have reviewed my

records: and do not find a willine nor direct acknowledement

of the R. B McMasters billing responsibility, alleged by

Mr. Horak in his letter of the

sane date, written on plain

watermarked stationery bearing questionable signature.

That purportedly official telephone company document claims

that I owe your company $1, 041.42.

I deny any responsibility

for the reason that Mr. McMasters personally effected the

installation of the phone at 3055 Leahy (243-6382), In his

name and as an officer of the now-defunct Genesis Corpora-

tion.

I have caused approximately $20,000 to be paid to

Mr.

Mcrasters, privately and corporately. 1oy.ats unsuccess

responsibility for something else i do not owe in Mr.

McMasters behalf. He and the Genesis Corporation were.

personally and corporately responsible for

My records reflect that hundreds of

vindictive;

asparaging and slanderous lone distance teleohone calle

that I did owe the bill.

Gordon Novel, Worker for the CIA

Another important witness in the Shaw trial

was

Gordon Novel, a bugging and eleetronics expert who

worked for the ClA.

Garrison tried to subpoena him,

but he. left.New Orleans and fled .to Ohio. Garrison

was never able to extradite Novel from Ohio to Loui

knew who had killed David Ferrie. (Ferric died mys-

sure that Novel would never be extradited to Louisi-

ana. to testify.: Since Novel never was extradited

and since Governor Rhodes of Ohio blocked his extra-

He said Garrison was going to be destroyed and that

she should cooperate with NBC.

The NBC Special on June 19, 1967

The NBC-Walter Sheridan special on June 19,

1967, titled "The JFk Conspiracy - The Case of Jim

Garrison"

• was packed with Sheridanese.. Here are

the principal examples:

Dean Andrews in New Orleans had

played a key role in the Shaw trial because Clay.

Bertrand had telephoned him in a hospital shortly

after the assassination and asked him to represent

Andrews. told so many different

stories about Clay Bertrand that the truth was dif

ficult to determine.

Frank McGce asked Andrews on the program about

Glay Bertrand and whether he was Clay Shaw. Andrews

said Bertrand was actually Eugene C. Davis, a bar

Sheridan's coup quickly blew

up in his face when Davis denied the shole thing.

When the trial finally took place, Shaw was pegged

as Bertrand by a woman who saw him sign his name as

Clay Bertrand.

Apparently Sheridan had

paid him a lot more than $500.

Sheridan Could Not Get Russo to "Cooperate"

Sheridan himself appeared on screen to discuss

Russo. He

Sheridan interpreted for

that Russo told him that his testimony against Shaw

Bribing and Attempting to Bribe Witnesses

In addition to bribing and attempting to bribe

witnesses, Sheridan also had meetings with one of

Garrison's part-time investigators, William Gur-

vich. Garrison found out about the meetings and

did not give Gurvich all of the information

Jim Garrison said about Sheridan and the NBC

which some powerful outside interests will go in

order to interfere with state government."

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical

Computers and Automation, established 195l and

therefore the oldest magazine in the field of com-

puters and data processing, believes that the pro-

fession of information engineer includes not only

competence in handling information using computers

and other means, but also a broad responsibility.

in a professional and engineering sense, for:

- The reliability and social significance

of pertinent input data;

- The social value and truth of the

output results.

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-

fessional responsibility for the reliability and

significance of the data he uses, and the safety

and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human

beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes

from time to time articles and other information

related to socially useful input and output of data

systems in a broad sense.

To this end se seek to

publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical

- but productive of thought and an improved and

safer

"house" for all humanity, an earth in which

our children and later generations may have a fu-

ture, instead of facing extinction..

The professional information engincer needs to

relate his engineering to the most important and

most serious problems in the world today:

nuclear «capons, pollution, the population explo

sion, and many more.

SOURCE:

Numerous news Items, the

latest dd in October 1967•

OS INDICES RESULIS:

Subject's file contains newspaper clippings dating from March

1967 when CARRISON charged him with conspiracy in connection with

a burglary of a munitions bunker at Houma, Louisiana in 1961 together

with David FERRIE and ARCACHA-SMITH. To avoid arrest, NOVEL left

New Orleans, first going to Mclean, Virginia where he was given a

lie detector test by Lloyd B.. FURR, a private detective.

See summary

on FURR). This incident tended to give credence to NOVEL's initial

claim that he was working for CIA because of the Agency's promimity to

McLean, Va.

After NOVEL vacated his New Orleans apartment in March 1967

a letter written by him was found under the linoleum on a sink

drainboard. by the new tenant, a girl who turned it over to her boy

friend, who gave it to a professor at a New Orleans university who in

turn gave it to a reporter on the New Orleans STATES-HEM; Hoke MAY.

Hoke MAY was granted a Covert Security Approval in April 1958

for unwitting use by Project FJINDULGE. MAY was not to be directly

employed by FJINDULGE but was to be used in connection with his

position with a provate firm which handled work for the Project.

The letter was presumably written to a "Mr. WEISS" In CIA and referred

to classified DOUBLE-CHEK activities in 1961 in which NOVET claimed

he was involved. This matter was reviewed by CI/R&A at the time the

matter received publicity and it was determined that DOUBLE CHoK

was created by the Agency for the sole purpose of making payments to

No connection with NOVEL could be established. NOVEL knew Sergio

ARCACHA-SMITH who was New Orleans head of the Frente Revolucionario

Although ARCACHA-SMITH had no Agency clearance, NOVEl could have gained

an impression from him that he was employed by CIA.

In October 1967 NOVEL was granted immunity from arrest by GARRISON

on the Houma Bunker burglary charge and returned to Louisiana to

testify before the East Baton Rouge Parish Grand Jury in their probe

on crime and labor troubles in the State of Louisiana.

DELATES:

The Agency had no connection with the Houma Munitions Bunker.

However, an Agency training site was located at Belle Chasse, Louisiana

and Colonel Thomas BURBANK, State of Louisiana Police Superintendent, was

one of the Louisiana officials witting of Agency affiliation with

Belle Chasse. It is noted from news items concerning NOVEL's testimony

before the Louisiana Labor probers in October 1967, that Colonel BURBANK

was also a witness at the same time, although, there is no mention that

BURBANK and NOVEL, knew each other.

BURBANK testified that every Louisiana

sheriff was notified to "clean up" gambling and other vice in Louisiana.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel

#526113

1. On 20 May 1969, the Director of Security advised that

he had received a call from Mr. Bienvenu, Director of Security;

National Security Agency, regarding a possible impersonation

by Subject. According to Mr. Biehvenu, an ex-Federal Bureau of

Investigation agent, Mr. Russel !

Aufrance, 3256 South Union

Avenue, Alliance, Ohio, 44601,

had called Mr. Mathison and

advised that a contact of his had stated that Subject had shown a

CIA credential and indicated that he was employed by the Agency.

MI. Aufrance advised he called the National Security Agency to

bring this matter to the attention of the highest security officials

in Washington and that if anyone wished to contact him they should

call him before 5:00 p.m., this date.

2. After reviewing Subject's file and confirming that Mr.

Aufrance was an ex-Federal Bureau of Investigation agent, I briefed

the Director of Security who requested that I call Mr. Aufrance and

advise him that we were knowledgeable of Subject and that on other

occasions he had inferred he was employed by CIA. In addition, that

we intended to turn this information over to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation for investigation since the FBI had jurisdiction on such

impersonation cases.

3.

I later briefed Mr. Fred J. Cassidy, FBI/Liaison, who

suggested that I advise Mr. Aufrance to report the information to

local FBI agents.

In MI. Cassidy's presence, I called Mr. Aufrance

who repeated what he had told Mr. Mathison.

He also stated that

Subject's wife is now separated from him and is suing him for divorce

in Columbus, Ohio.

She has stated that Subject is armed, carries a

tear gas weapon and some kind of a .22 caliber pistol, concealed as a

fountain pen. She stated that Subject is leaving Columbus for Reno,

Nevada, where he intends to open a gambling establishment. In further

discussion with Mr. Aufrance, he indicated his source was a friend of

Subject's wife and from other statements he made, it is believed that his

source is Thomas F. Hughes, Jr., who was interviewed by the Chicago

Field Office on 18 April 1969.

4. After further discussion with Mr. Aufrance during which he

indicated he was leaving for a fishing trip in Canada and would not

return until Sunday, 25 May 1969, it was agreed that he would contact

the local Federal Bureau of Investigation and brief them regarding

Subject and that I would, meanwhile, alert FBI Headquarters/Washington,

which could follow-up with the local office.

5. I then provided Mr. Cassidy with all pertinent information

regarding Mr. Aúfrance's telephone call and all information on Subject.

MI. Cassidy will'keep us advised.

no record

A

reliable, confidential source, who is personally

acquainted

with Thomas F. HUGHES, Jr furnished the following

observations ou HUGHES:

That HUGHES was born and reared in

the South Shore area of Chicago; that HUGHES Inherited the

fanily business,

, Hughes Oil and Coal, and has built it into

a successful business; that HUGHES seems to have an income

sufficiont to maintain a 30 foot boat, patronize the smart

and oxpenalvo rostaurants and night clubs, live in an

oxponsive apartmont and dress in a stylish fashion; and

that HUGHES has a reputation for "liking the ladies" and

Is a steady patron of the Playboy Club and other night

spots.

HUGHES is regarded as

a "man about town" who enter

tains frequently around the night club circuit. His tastes

are expensive..

The confidential source further related

that HUGHES may have some effeminate mannerisms,

but nothing

derogatory was known in that regard. The confidential source

further volated that he has always wondered about the source

01 HUGIES' mongy.

HUGHES has various businoss investments,

Including some apneamond bulldinge and an Interest In tho

Maryland Hocol. To soureo pointed out that tho Maryland

Hotel has always been Identified as having ownership in the

Chicago syndicate. The source speculated that HUGHES may be

a front man or have some support from the Syndicate; howeyer,

he (confidential source) has never known HUGhes to be involved

in any Syndicate operations or activities.

GIGAS, Chris

Subjoct in identified as e California Investigator who administered

a polygraph test to Edgar Eugene FRADLEY who has been charged with conspiracy

by GARRISON.

Subject was born 12 August 1921 at Omabe, Hebraska. He 1s a former

Agency employee who BOD in October 1949 as a GS-9 Intelligence Officer.

Subject resigned his staff statue in February 1951 and becano a staff

agent with Projact FID MORPH 1D Turkey from March 1951 until July 1952-

(Ela Vite Anne Claudia QUOAS nee SETARO vas granted a covert security clearance

1n February 1952 for use in a clerical capacity in the Middle East.)

In his ancienment with Project SIDOMORPHin Turkey, Subject was a

source of constant embarrasement in fle contacte with Turkish police]&

officiale. He was boastful; indiscreet, lacking in sound judement, knew

Ilttle or nothing In the fields In wich he ve self professedly an expert

and we guilty of security breaches in falllag to maintain hie cover..

in one Lncident he made recommendations of police reorganizations to be

nade by province governors in Turkeys woereas, in Turkey, the Police &

Department 1s a national orgenisation and not subject to the dictates of

the provlace governors.

This caused nuch: 111 wil and Iriction with the

Turkish police.

Subject professed to be an expert in bia knowledge or the polyeraph

mohtne and claimed he had tuo years' expertence sith the los Angeles

Police Department prior to his employment with the Agency. However, 1+

was developed that Instead of this claimed experience, he had actually

spent one or two weeks in a detective achool connected uith the Ios Angeles

Police Depertuent where he received belor average grades.

In October 1952 he approached an Agency employee regarding a new.

typo of technical eguipment and thie conversation led to the dioclosure

by Subject that he was suployed by the Ageney In a covert capacity; that

he was teaching lle detection techniques to foreign police departmonts

without bolng authorized or competent to do so.

Subject was briefed 1n

December 1952 with stress placed on the importance of living up to his

security responsibilitles and exercising utmost precaution in protecting

the covert intereste of the Agency.

In spite of the strong warninge given him 10 this Interview, Subject

time when the Departuent of State was not authorized to have a polygraph

machine and Congressional legislation was pending at the time regarding

such authorization. An a result of this misrepresentation, subject vas

afforded another security interview In March 1953-

He explained that

his cover company sold equiment to foreign countries through the Mutual

Ald Progran and supplied consultant services to the State Department but

Subject denied that be ever represented himself an a State Department

polygraph operator. After the security Interview Subject was also assessed

by an Agency psychologlot (March 1953) and vas found to be egotiatical,

emotionally unstable, possensed of a need to baild himself up ta the

eyes of others ond gave either exaggerated or completely erroneous

Information as to his past positions. Els Intelligence quotient was foind

to be comparatively. lon in relation to thome of other gancy employees.

In Apr1l 1953 termination of his employment was recommended.

that he was responsible for supplying the classifled information to HARRELSON

about ENDINORPE Jectivities.

Leonard HARRILSON 18 a private Inveetigator pecializing in hypnotion

and the use of the polygraph machine.

In 196% he was employed by the Keeler

HARRELSON 18 belleved to be a person of poor morals. He was given

a medical dlecharge from the Army as a psychoneurotic in 1949 and had been

court martlaled twice for Impersonating non-commissioned officers of a

rank higher than he possessed. In his bustness partnership with FURR,

HARRELSON would ninrepresent himself as being with the FBI by covering the

word "Anericon" when presenting hit credentiale and just showing

"Bureau

with the name "Schlumberger."

HE SAYS FIVE OR SIX 07 THE BONES were open.

Inside, he says, were rifle grenades, land mines and some

"little missiles" of a kind he had never seen before.

The friend said he remonstrated with Banister because

"fooling with this kind of stuff could get you in trouble."

He added:

'"Banister said no, it was all right, that he had approval

night, that somebody was supposed to pick it up. He sald

a bunch of fellows connected with the Cuban deal asked: to

leave it there overnight."

Banister's friend said this happened sell before the

April Bay of Pigs invasion.

eventually were taken by boat to Cuba for use in a diver-

sionary operation staged in conjunction with the Bay of

NOVEL'S ACCOUNT OF THE explosives caper sharply:

conflicts with Garrison's charges against Arcacha and

Novel. The DA's accusation says the burglary took place

after Aug. 1, 196l-three months after the Cuban disaster.

The DA accuses the two men of conspiring to burglarize

a bunker at an abandoned military base at Houma. Gar-

rison's bill of information says the bunker was leased by

the Schlumberger Well Services Co. of Houston

Schlumberger officials say they know nothing of any

As to the date the Houma burglary happened, no one

seems to know or will say exactly when it took place.

their records are missing, and the Terrebonne Parish DA,

Wilmore Broussard, will not reveal the date he charges

it is "material evidence" in his case.

PLOTKIN SAYS HE MADE A TRIP to Houma to get

Shaw, a tall white-haired retired New Orleans business-

man, who stoutly denies participating in a plot to kill

Kennedy, was managing director of the International Trade

Mart. He was with the organization for 19 years and in a

favorable position to observe the movements of international

commerce through Amelica's second-ranking seaport.

On March 4, Pase Sera, an afternoon newspaper in

Rome, carried a story. which said shaw is a director of a

firm known as
