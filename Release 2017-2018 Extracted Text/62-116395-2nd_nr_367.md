By memorandum dated 6/10/75, I advised that on 6/7/75

il.

captioned individuals, former New Left informants who were

developed and directed by SA. Gary M. Laturno of this Division

while assigned to the New Orleans Office, contacted SA. Laturno

to advise they were in Washington, D. C., to confer with staff

members of the Senate Select Committee (SENSTUDY).

alicam

On 6/28/15, captioned individuals again contacted SA Laturn.

They advised that on 6/7/75, they met SENSTUDY staff members

but declined to confer with them regarding their service with the FBI.

They explained they were apprehensive regarding the appearance

and behavior of the staff members, for they looked and acted like a

In

group of "movement"' radicals. On 6/28/75, they met with one

Charles Kirbow, an aide to Senator John G. Tower (R-Texas) who

is Vice Chairman of SENSTUDY, (Congressional Services Office

advises Charles Bruce Kirbow is a staff member in Senator

Tower's Office.). Kirbow, a former CIA. Intelligence Officer,

appeared sympathetic to the problems of the intelligence community

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Senstudy Committee

Harry Eugene Schafer

(Former No. 1850-S)

Jill D. Schafer

(Former No. 1868-S)

but on occasion reflected a CIA bias. Many of his questions seemed

designed, however, to refute allegations made against the FBI

by former Tampa informant Joe Burton. Kirbow also questioned the

Schafers regarding the Bureau's administrative procedures

relative to the handling of New Left informants.

As a matter of courtesy, the Schafers desire to furnish

to the Bureau the details of their contact with Kirbow. They

will mail a detailed letter to the Director, FBl Headquarters.

RE COMMENDATION:

None. For information.
