Source told DE FEO he would not see HOFFA in

Washington

because of his illness and did not care to

discuss this matter on the phone. He told DE FEO he would

speak to HOFFA in his behalf if HOFFA visited his home.

Source advised he will not do anything on this loan for

DE FEO since he feels

• that HOFFA does not want the Forum

Motor Lodge to get the loan through dE FEo or he would not

have allowed the loan to be reduced to $500, 000.00.

Re:

PHILIP WEISS

Informant was visited by WEISS on 5/12/63.

WEISS brought with him an individual whom he introduced

as his younger brother but did

He asked the source if he

that he (WEISS) was about to be indicted in Nashville.

Source said WEISS appeared very sick and nervous and was

taking pills during the short time they visited. Informant

told WEISS that he had read of the indictments returned and

assumed the Grand Jury would not

return any further indict-

ments.

WEISS stated he had received information that the

Grand Jury would reconvene and that he would be indicted

shortly thereafter. Informant attempted to learn the source

of WEISS' information but was unsuccessful.

WEISS then left

without further discussion of any pertinent significance.

In view of the fact that informant is on the

road to recovery and intends resuming his duties for the

IBT on a limited basis within the rest two weeks, informant

case file is being reopened.
