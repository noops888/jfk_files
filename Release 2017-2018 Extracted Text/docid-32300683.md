ANTI-RACKETEERING

Re Havana letter to Bureau dated February 6, 1958.

Continuous contacts with the following individuals

have failed to develop any further information concerning

the subjects and any possible gambling interests on their

part in Havana:

PCI GOFFREDO CELLINI, Afternoon Manager, Gambling

Casino, Hotel Nacional, who is personally acquainted with

both subjects;/

ARTIE NEWAN, Credit Manager, Gambling Casino,

Hotel Nacional, who is also acquainted with both subjects;

Havana-4;

Havana-13;

Lit. JORGE PENA HERRERA, Head of the Alien Control

Section, Department of Investigation, Cuban National Police.

(Tra)

No additional investigation concerning subjects

is contemplated by the Legal Attache, Havana, until such

time as information is received indicating that subjects

have renewed their activity in Havana.

In this regard it

should be noted that detailed review of incoming and out-

going flight manifests covering any extended period of time

is not feasible since the Alien Control Section of the De-

partment of Investigation does not have personnel available

for such a project.

uch a check can be made tor a specim

ate or for a period covering only a specified few days. (AM)

Extra copies of this letter trYs been prepared for

forwarding by the Bureau to Pittsburgh.
