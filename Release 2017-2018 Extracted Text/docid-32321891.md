Title: JFK RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992 (The

Act)

Synopsis: Requested original records enclosed.

Enclosures:

1.

92-406-2-157 (SF-2584) 4/22/63 Ñ€.6, 7

2.

92-123-2-459 (SF-2405) 7/5/61, pg. 2

Details:

Reference is made to HQ EC dated 2/21/97, and HQ

telephone calls 3/5 and 3/6/97.

The serial that was requested in the 2/21/97 EC, namely

66-672B-326, was sent to the JFK Task Force via EC 10/2/96.

on 3/5/97, request was made to send in 66-672B-p.1,

3/27/64, elsur# SF-1851.

There is no such serial in San

Francisco, as 66-672B starts in 1966. Upon further review of San

Francisco's EC of 10/2/96, this appears to be 105-44254 Sub 2

3/27/64, Elsur# SF-1851, which was sent to HQ 10/2/96.

The requests for elsur# SF-2584, 92-406-Sub 2, 4/22/63,

pgs. 6 and 7, and 92-123-sub 2, 7/5/61, are enclosed.
