On 10/12/60, Victor Manuel Paneque Y Batista advised that he came

to the Us in September, 1960, on behalf of the Movimiento Insurrecional

to two individuals in the Navy Department to whom he presented a plan

for aiding anti-Castro forces in Cuba.

On this trip he utilized the

services

of Dr. Conte Aguero as an interpreter. U

claimed to be one of the leaders of an anti-Castro organization known

to WDC and New York with Aguero, but had later split with Aguero after

Aguero had attempted to deceive Paneque, whereupon Aguero started a
