In June 1972, DCD was advised by a WH Division

staffer that one Rolando MASTERRER, Jr, whom the

staffer had personally known in the Miami area, was

about to become VP of Sales for MAC in Washington, D. C.

Masferrer was described as the son of Rolando Avcadio

MASFERNER y Rojas (201-42669).

Our Washington office

nad no contact with the junior Masterrer, but in May

and June of 1973, he initiated contact with the DCI

Miami office and provided information concerning the

efforts of one Guillermo YGLESIAS to solicit Masferrer's

assistance in raising money for secret CIA operations

in Latin America.
