Previous information has indicated that the

captioned anti-Castro organization is planning to carry

out a bombing raid over Cuba from Bimini in the Bahama

Islands. The airplane scheduled to be used in the raid,

an Aero Commander, Number N2624B, was located at the

Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Plorida.

On December 21, 1963, our source in the matter

who has furnished reliable information in the past learned

that one of the motors of the above-mentioned plane had

burned out and that plans were being made to obtain

another plane.

On December 22, 1963, Orlando Bosch Avila,

as the vigilance of the opposition would be at a

minimum at that time.

Charles Bush, ouner of the above-mentioned

Aero Commander airplane, stated on December 22, 1963,

that he would substitute a two-motor Piper late airplane

for the Aero Commander.
