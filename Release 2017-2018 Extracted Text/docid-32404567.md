Associate Director for Research and Review

Subject:

Backchannel Communications Between Mexico City, JMWAVE, and

Headquarters (ARRB Request for Additional Information and Records

No. CIA-13)

ARRB Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-13 asked CIA to

determine whether there existed any "backchannel" communications between the

Mexico City Station, JMWAVE, or Headquarters during 1963. "Backchannel" was taken

to mean, inter alia, any administrative, senior staff, or restricted access communications

or any written or electronic communications other than cables or dispatches of the types

already included in the JFK Collection. Work by the CIA Team has not uncovered any

indication of an established or ad hoc informal backchannel per se in 1963. There has

been no indication of the existence of any additional recoverable records other than

official Agency communications.

Members of the CIA Team received a very detailed comprehensive briefing on the

working of the CIA's Cable Secretariat as it handled electronic cable traffic in 1963.

Various members of the CIA Team also have examined the Mexico City Station,

JMWAVE, and Headquarters communications material available in the JFK Collection

and have seen nothing to indicate that communications existed within another channel.

In addition, the ARRB has spoken informally with numerous former and current CIA

employees who served overseas during the relevant time period. Each of these

individuals, without exception, stated that they had no knowledge of the existence of

any established or ad hoc electronic backchannel communications. Several mentioned

that while such a form of communication might have been possible in 1963, it would

have been a very unusual last resort since both the Chief of Station and the

communicator could have expected to be immediately relieved if such a communication

came to light.

During the relevant time period, CIA electronic cable traffic was handled by CIA

communicators through a restricted handling communications channel separate from

53217 DooId:32404567 Page 2

that used by the Department of State for its cable traffic. CIA communicators were

required to send an information copy of every communication between stations to

"Director," that is, to Headquarters. Once a cable arrives at Headquarters, routing

indicators at the top of the cable and cryptonyms in the "slug line" in the body of the

cable were used to direct a cable to the proper recipients. Cables received widespread

distribution or restricted, special, or proscribed and limited handling based on the

sensitivity and type of information they contained. Any limited distribution to

particular offices was indicated by the routing indicators and any limited distribution

within an office was indicated by the cable "slug line." Traffic received by a station

from Headquarters or another station was handled in the same manner and distributed

to the appropriate individual or branch within the station.

Formal station traffic to and from CIA Headquarters through the diplomatic pouch was

handled by hand in much the same manner as cable traffic. Dispatches were sent to the

designated addressee and packages to the office, branch, or individual indicated on the

address label. However, in 1963, it would not have been unusual for a Chief of Station

or any other member of a station to send an envelope marked "eyes only" to any

individual in Headquarters, nor would it have been unusual for someone in

Headquarters to send an "eyes only" envelope to an individual in an overseas station.

Since these types of messages were not considered official CIA traffic, no records were

kept.

The CIA reports, and all of the individuals with whom we spoke agreed, that while it

was technically possible for a CIA Chief of Station to send an electronic communication

to his or her counterpart in another station in 1963, to do so would have required the

acquiescence of the communicator to violate one of the most basic and oldest rules of

Agency communications traffic. Yet it was entirely possible to send non-time-sensitive

messages to and from individuals through the diplomatic pouch. In addition, given the

locations of the Mexico City and JMWAVE (Miami) stations, communications could

have been sent via the US Mail system or even by telephone. Communications between

an individual at Headquarters and an individual attached to JMWAVE could easily

have been sent through the mail. Similarly, a person traveling from Mexico City Station

to any location in the United States could be asked to mail a letter or package to an

individual at JMWAVE or Headquarters. Most commonly, sensitive messages simply

were handed to individuals traveling between Headquarters and a particular station

and hand carried to the designated addressee. Hand carried messages and messages

sent by US Mail would have not officially existed as CIA communications. No records

were kept of any non-official traffic between Headquarters and any station.

Dear Mr. Gunn:

Re: ARRB Reguest CIA 13, Ior Intormation

On "Backchannel" Communications

The following is responsive to referent request.

antonion be the or re

referent request and an addendum thereto

accessioned by Mr. Dewey Claridge's book, you asked for

the forms of so-called "backchannel"

communications. Further, the request asks for any

backchannel communications between Mexico City Station, CIA

Headquarters and JMWAVE for specific time periods.

First, we have previously advised you concerning

Roger/Cactus designated communications

which you have

acknowledged as a partial response.

Second, during the DO

records briefing follow-on which took place

on 1

April 1997, a question-and-answer session, the subject of

"backchannel" communications was covered.

During the period 1959-1964, the term "backchannel"

applied to non-CIA communications sent through Agency

communications facilities.

It was a communications channel

used by senior government officials, including the

President.

There is another term applied to similar communications

which is frequently but erroneously labeled "backchannel"

communications.

It is the "privacy" channel used by CIA

managers primarily to discuss personnel matters.

Conceivably senior CIA officials could communicate in the

"privacy" channel without coordinating the cable with a

particular area division, for example Western

Hemisphere/Latin American Division.

However, the message

would still be in cable format, addressed "Eyes Only COS" or

something similar, and would be sent and received through

regular Office of Communication

facilities.

## Page 5

With reference to your question can the Agency retrieve

any of these categories of cables, the answer is no.

such cables were not

captured by any organized filing

process or any generic or specific filing term and were not

placed in official files. Therefore, there are no indices

or other indicators that can be used to search for them.

In

addition, because any copies which were retained were

considered unofficial files, there were no retention

policies governing their retention or destruction.

If you require anything further in this regard, please

advise.

Sincerely,

J. Barry Harrelson

RE: Status of CIA Responses to

Requests for Additional Information and

Records

(U) This memorandum is submitted in response to formal request

number 13 (CIA #13) from the Assassination Records Review Board.

**CIA-13 Mexico City Backchannel Communications

a .

(C) In the question-and-answer segment of the Directorate of

Operations Records briefing follow-on of 1 April 1997, the

backchannel/privacy topic was covered. First, a distinction needs to be

made between backchannel and privacy channel.

b.

(S) In 1959-1964 the term "backchannel" applied to non-Agency

communications through Agency communications facilities; that is, as

utilized by senior officials, including the President, of other U.S.

Government agencies.

c.

(S)

Senior Agency officials conceivably could communicate --

through "privacy channels" -- without coordinating the cable with

Western Hemisphere/Latin America Division, but it would still be in

cable format, addressed "Eyes Only COS,"

and would be sent and received

through regular Office of Communications facilities. Agency officers

frequently -- but erroneously -- interchanged the terms "back channel"

and

"privacy channel."

Barry,

As we discussed, please note the description of a "privacy" or "back" channel in Dewey

Clarridge's A Spy For All Seasons. Admittedly, Clarridge is discussing the mid-1980's but this

channel was not mentioned during our agency briefings. Did such a channel exist in 1959-64?

How was it used? How did it work? Are any cables sent via this channel recoverable today? As

you know, we are particularly interested in any communications to and from Moscow, Mexico

City, and JMWAVE.

Information on "back" channels is the subject of our Request for Additional Information and

Records No. CIA-13 of November 1, 1996. If you wish, an additional formal request focusing on

"back" channels as a broader issue can be sent.

Thanks for your help.

Michelle

A SPY FOR ALL SEASONS

North set himself up in my outer office. He needed access to our

secure communications with Lisbon to work on the landing rights prob-

lem. I sent the cables via my "privacy" or "back" channel to Lisbon. A

privacy channel is the way a division chief communicates with his chiefs

o1 matters that are particularly sensitiveâ€”usually personnel matters.

Cables in this channel are supposed to be destroyed on both ends after

nincty days. Knowing this, I asked my secretary to set up a special file for

these cables, separate from the regular files, to have a record of events. I

did this because I still clearly recalled Ted Shackley's admonition to me.

In 1977, Shackley was the associate deputy director for operations

(ADDO). He gave me advice, saying, "When you support another

agency, keep a detailed record, because when it all goes south, guess

who's holding the sack,"

This was a Friday morning, and Casey, McMahon, and Clair George

were all away from Washington. Ed Juchniewicz, the ADDO, was run-

ning the Directorale of Operations. A copy of all incoming and outgoing

divisional back-channel cable traffic is sent to the office of the deputy

dircctor of operations; thus Juchniewicz and his staff had full access to

our coininunications between Washington and Lisbon. The DDO and

ADDO read the divisional back-channel traffic first every day, unless

some uther crisis took precedence. What was going on was so unusual it

must have been brought to Juchniewicz's attention immediately.

At North's behest 1 contacted our chief in Lisbon, telling him to pull

out all the stops to secure landing rights for the El Al aircraft. My efforts

were not isolated-the fight was nearing the turnaround point and

North was trying anything he thought would work. Bud McFarlane was

yanked from a meeting with Presidents Reagan and Gorbacher in

Switzerland to place a call to the Portuguese foreign minister to see if he

could get the needed elearance.

It was all in vain; the Eil Al plane had to turn around. Once the aircraft

returned to Israel, North had to figurc out an alternative means to get his

shipment to Iran. Ever if landing rights had eventually been secured in

Lisbon, the El Al 747 was no longer available to fly the cargo there. The

shipment was stuck in Tel Aviv.

The problem rattled on through Friday, the twenty-second. North

wanted Lisbon to contact his confederate Richard Sccord, who was going

by the alias Richard Copp, to see about arranging other transportation.

For me this episode was the first time Secord's name had surfaced-I'd

never heard of him before. When it became clear to North that Secord

could not solve the problem from the Lisbon end, Ollie asked me, "Can

you recommend an aircraft charter company that can provide a couple of

707s to get this stuff out of Israel?"

As stated in the second paragraph at the beginning of this letter, we seek to

review the original files that we have requested. The DO provided no response

and no time frame for a response.

CIA-13 Mexico City Backchannel Communications.

This request, dated November 1, 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up briefing

on April 1, 1997. The DO provided no response and no time frame for a

response.

CIA-14 Mexico City Station Annual Reports.

This request, dated December 23, 1996, was raised at the DO follow-up briefing

on April 1, 1997. The DO provided no response and no time frame for a

response.

CIA-15 Win Scott files identified in Russ Holmes Files.

CIA has completed its response and no further action is needed.

**CIA-16 Oswald Pre-Assassination Files.

The HRG reportedly received a lengthy answer from the Office of Security on the

LHO fles and a formal response to the Review Board's request is in process.

Oswald's Office of Security file has been located and will be delivered to HIRG

for review in April. Access to other files will require a special request from HRG

to the Office of Security and should be requested by HIRG for ARRB staff review.

II. Informal Requests.

All of the following informal requests have previously been made to CIA. For future

reference, they will be referred to by the "Informal Request" (IR) number provided

(Backchannel Communications)

Dear John:

We request your assistance in obtaining access to information and records of possible

pertinence to the John F. Kennedy assassination. We request that you provide

information to answer the following queries:

What forms of backchannel communications were there between the

Mexico City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters

during 1963? By "backchannel" we mean, inter alia, any administrative,

senior staff, or restricted access communications, or any written or

electronic communications other than regular cables or dispatches (of the

type included in the JFK Collection).

Were there, in fact, any backchannel communications between the Mexico

City Station (including the COS), JMWAVE, or Headquarters during the

time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963?

3.

To the extent that there were any backchannel communications for the

time periods 27 Sept - 16 Oct 1963 and 22 Nov - 30 Nov 1963 (other than

those currently contained in the JFK Collection), please make such records

available for review.

These requests should be interpreted in their broadest reasonable sense. To the extent

that you question whether a particular record is encompassed by our request, please let

us know and we can advise you whether we seek to include it.
