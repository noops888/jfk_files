HELSINKI:

1. ' Events of 30 July 1962:

AWHIP arrived in Helsinki on 30 Jult 1962. He called HBFINCH.

according to plan, and after his second call (due to his hotel porter's

abysinal understanding of Inglish), Fallucci established contact. with

ANWHIP vithout further difficulty. The meeting took place in the

restaurant of his hotel, the Yaakuna, and later in his room.

We had

not at this time located AMLASH, so the time was spent briefing AMWHIF

on the local scene, and on his conduct with AlASt whan they mat.

The

meeting lasted

about one and a half hours.

Later the

same day we called AMwHIP at his hotel to report

no progress in locating AMLASH.

Feeling. It advisable to keep AMHIF

occupied, we took him out to dinner at Fisketorpet, located in the

subuchs of Helsinki.

The evening lasted until 1200, terminating with a

drink at the rool par of the vaakuna.

Juring the six hours, we had an

opportunity. to explain carefully to AWHIP that in order for us to help

his friend, AlIASH must be willing to follow our directions and agree to

certain conditiong (already agreed upon bi interested Has. parties.

benevSient and subjective manner. This being rather far removed from our

intended approach to, and opinion of AMLASH: AWHIP will require handling

of a close nature in order that he fully understands and is aware of our

He reported to AWHIP the fact that we had not located AMIASH, and suggested

that ve rave dinner together, to which he agreed.

We met AMWHiP at 2100

at, our hotel, the Kamo, and proceeded to the Royal Restaurant for dinner.

ANHIP was obviously getting on pins and needles because we had not found

his friend. He suggested chat we call up the Cuban Festival delegation,

or try some notals that evening. We persuaded him that it was not the

best idea get; and to give other people more time to locate him. He

agreed, but kept coming up with ideas all evening for ways to locate AMASH

He suggested that AMASH liked right clubs; and that after dinner we could

perhaps try several, We agreed, more to placate him that with any thoughts

oi success.

We tried several, the Bransparken and the Theater Criti,

both of which were filled with drinking Finns, but no signs of AMLASH. The

Finns, engaging in their national pastime, obviously irritated AMWHIP, and

after being rushed around in the boater Grill for an hour, ho said that

he thought this was a waste of tire.. We agreed, grabbed a taxi and went

home. During the evening, we told AMWHIP that tomorrow moring, if nothing

had turned up, we would start by calling the better hotels in town ourselves,

and try this rather laborious method to locate AMLASH. We agreed to meet

dining room, a practice not uncommon in this Station/ recommended restaurant,

as it is often used by businessmen to have private dinners and afterwards,

business discussions.

We arrived at the inite Lady first, arranged for the dinner, and

awaited AWHIP and AMLASH, who arrived at 2110 by taxl. Although AMWHIP

had suggested to us that the discussions should be merely devoted to

getting acquainted the first evening, AMASh commenced almost irmediately

As reported in our cable,

the strein of his unexpected meeting with AMWHIP. Although obviously

under notional strain, AMASH presented his feelings in a relatively calm

felt that if he could do something really significant for the creation of

Allash said he had had plans to blow up an oil refinery, as he felt that

the continuing existence. of a semolenco of noral functioning in Cuba

depended upon a continuing supply of petroleum, supplies of which, as we

know; are at a critical stage today.

He also wanted to plan the execution

01 Carlos Rodriguez and the Soviet Ambassador, and also to eliminate Fidel,

ly execution if necessary. He feels that if fidel is eliminated, It would

be much easier to effect a take-over. (We listened for the most part, but

at this point tried to esplain to AM.ASH that men like Rodriguez could easily

be replaced by Moscow, and that the killing of the Soviet Ambassador, would

have only the briefest effect on the Soviet control of cuba.) AMLASH was

not too interested in listening at this point, and continued by saying that

It he could achieve all these actions, plus others, in one master stroke,

a take-over, during the ensuing confusion, would be much facilitated. He

did not feei that Raul or Che would be able to rally the people in sufficient

tine to preveni, oposition forces frum forming. His arguments and plans had

many flaws, but AMWHIP could not help admiring (to himself) AMLASH!'S

professed desire for vigorous and, heperully, effective actions, designed

to alter the situation in no uncertain terms. While we were making no

committments or plans, we pointed out to AMASH that schemes like he envisiozed

certainly had their place, but that a lot of coordination, planning, information-

ccllection, etc., were necessary prerequisites to ensure the value and success

of such plans. AMliASH said he agreed with this, but ve werent too sure just

favored after the fighting was over. We felt that AM.ASIl meant that he was

as much concerned about his (AMLASH's) position in the government and

personal stake in a new Cuba, as he was about arything else. It is our

impression that AMIAST feels that he did not get his share of the spoils

or power from the Castro regime, in proportion to his contribution against

Batista. AMLASH is a complicated personality.

It is difficult to fairly

judge, at this time, AMASH's degree of concern for a truly revolutionized

cuba for the people's benefit, us his concern to see a new government in

cuba in which he gets just recognition.

This does not necessarily mean

that AMLASH wants high political office; but he does want credit for his

efforts and the resultant power and prestige among his countrymen.

Just as great as are AMAS's fears about the Castro's wirning of

concern thet the USA will begin to consider a status

/lity, such as he plans, and which looks as if it might depose the regine,

intr will withdraw its support from such efforts in the face of serious

Wealt fron the Soviets. Although AMASH did not say it in so many words,

it was apparent from the discussions that AVLASH would prefer to be able to

true cuba without any outside support (and by inference, obligations), but

is a realist enough to concede that any efforts to overthrow Castro

mat. have the support of PBPRIME. He is, therefore, willing to enter into

"cussions with a representative (s) of PEPPINE tewards this end.

AMLASH agreed to meet in Paris for the purpose of further debrierings

wi to give any intormation in any field which he has. he is also most

illing to discuss any plans which may lead to an overthrew of the present

wvernment.: "AMLASH stated many times, however, during the course of the

were concerned. He also does not wish to trust or be involved with, any

(Along this line,

AMWHIP stated that he did not think it advisable to reveal any of these

negotiations to AMCONCERI/], whom AMWHIP has known for mary years and is

quite friendly, but whom he does not feel can keep a secret of this nature:)

This meeting terminated at 0030 on 2 August. The three participants

took a taxi together back to tern. AMHIP and AlTASH stopped off at a 100al

right cluò, Ieater Oilien, mile we continued on to our hotel. No Incidents

of a security nature were observed, and it was felt that the meeting was

held without the knevledge or observation of the opposition.

4.

Meeting of 2 August =962.

We met with AMHIP in his hotel room (No. 142 at the Vaakuna) at

1700 hours on 2 August.

We discussed the events and talks of the preceding

evening for some time. At approximately 1800, AMASH arrived, greeted

us affably, and joined us for a drink. AMLASH used this meeting to re-

state his vosition concerning is desire for participation in a reäliv

significant action against the Castro regime. Having decided by this time

that further discussions and debrietings of AMAS™ should take place wit

a spanish-speaking c/u, we out thed the idea to meet for such a purpose in

Paria: ANTASH did not like tra idea de ton many pennia hoing munna do hea

cooperation with PBPRIME, but agreed that it would be best in order to

allow himself to express his ideas and plans better, and to be able to provide

us with his information in the greatest possible detail.

- e persuaded SHIP and AMASa that it would be best not to have

urthe meetings with them in Helsinki, but that we could continue our tails

in greater salety in Stockholm and Paris.

They agreed. AMASH also said

that he felt that he shouldn't see ANWHIP too much more in Helsinki, as he

was reginning now to make some public appearances; and his presence was

established to everyone in the city. Incidentally, prior to Thursday,

2 August, ALASH had purposely refrained from making any public appearanses

at the festival because (1) he and the other Cubans had been aware of the

AMSPEti group and their announced intentions, and (2) AMLASH did not feel

very disposed

to play the "Public Relations" man from Cuba and espouse the

"peace and friendship nonsense", as he called it.

However, AMLASTI also said

that he felt that he had better perform this role to some extent, as it was

expected of him by Fidel, and he did not wish to provide any unnecessary

chances for unsatisfactory reports to be sent back home concerning his lach

of cooperation with the Cuban delegation.: In making the arrangements for

a Paris meeting and further discussions, AMLASH said, in response to the

question, that it would be quite normal for him to be in Paris, as he had

already cleared this with Fidel, with whom, he remarked caustically, one

had to clear everything these days. He then expressed the idea that he

wuld like i rein iu faris, via siocknowm and at amirs suggestion,

spend a lew days there just relaxing. From there, or Copenhagen, he would

return to Prague for two days at most, in order to pick up his luggage,

then come as soon as possible to Paris. There, he intended to visit a

nospital of two,

as agreed upon with fidel, and spend a total of at least

a week there. He sald that if he was to retur to cuba to begin his

efforts, he did not wish to be away from Cuba any longer than necessary.

interested in i Fan American Miami-based stevardess, whom he would have

come over to stay with him. WHIP suggested to us that he thought the

stewardess might be connected with PBPRIME. He cased this apparertly on

a remark which the stewardess made concerning AMuSH's political frame of

mind last year. We answered that as far as we lew there was no basis. for

ANWHIP's thoughts along this line.) ANWHIP will try to get the stewardess

full name for us.

Meeting arrangements for Stockholm and Eelsinki vere laid on at

this meeting. AMLASH felt he had to stay until the end of the Festivai for

caves purposes.

since ANNIP had already accidentally run into several

people he knew, it was agreed that he should leave town for stockholm.in

the near future. We wuild remain behind until ALASH left, serving as ar

energency contact in the event of change in AMLASH's. plans: It was arranged

to meet AMASH if absolutely necessary, at either 1200 or 1600 each day

at a given restaurant in the center of the city. Normal security measures

for the "emergency" meeting were laid on. In Stockholm, meeting arrangements

for Paris will be established. AMWHIP departed Helsinki 5 Aigust and is

presumably starine at the Palace Hotel in Steake s

However, both ANASH and AWHIP did not want to become involved with him

they felt that this, in both their cases, might compromise their

Eiterests in AMASH's returning to Cuba. AlWHIP felt, for example, that

Venegas would almost certainly connect his presence here with an attempt. to

do something with AMLASH. AMASH also felt that he did not want to disclose

ally indications

of his real sympathies to Tenegas, 1f he (AMLASH) were going

reactions or opinions from Venegas, thought AMLASH. Venegas, it Is felt

by AKASH, might very possibly be counted on at a later date if this was

desirable. An approach could then be worked out at that time.

As reported, AMLASH came to the Festival as a "special delegate,"

aiter his request to fidel was approved.: AMLASH Claimed to fidel that he

was fatigued and sick and needed a good rest in Europe. The Festival

provided the excuse, Fidel bit the bait, and AMASH got to Europe to see

mate, his originel intention. AMulp felt that this 1a e logical end

honest explanation. It is interesting to note that neither the local

service, U/2, or any of the Cuban delegates he asked, could determine the

whereabouts of AMASH. It is perhaps reasonable to assume that the Cubans

were told not to tell of his presence to anyone not from their immediate

delegation.

influence over AMASH:

ALASH aiso trusts AWHIP explicitly, as evidenced

by his remark to us that AwHUP was the only one whom he felt that he

could fully trust and to whom he could speak openly.

Of course, he did

speak openly at length to us at the behest of AWHIP, but it is also

obvious that he does not tell us everything. ANWHTP has given good advice

in the handling of AMLASH, but, as he has a tendency to interpret AMLASH's

remarks and feelings subjectively, and to attempt to guide us a bit too

mich, it might be wise to eliminate in later portions of the talks in Paris.

as evidenced by his actions in this case. However, to his credit, he

responds readily to directions in this area, and follows rather weil suggestions

for adding to the security of the meetings. His remark about the

advisability of keeping his old friend ANCONCERT/l out of the operation or

from any knowledge thereof, is gratifying. AMHIP aiso has gently explained

to us, that while he is a Cuban at heart and loves the cubans, they simply

real tested reasons, they consider safe and discreet. As a general'

statement, we feel that AMWHIP is a good security risk operationally, and

that with more exposure to the game, will become a good and useful asset

under almost any circumstance. He is, however, somewhat subconsciously

subjective about his evaluations of AMLASH. He is completely honest, and is

using a considerable amount of his own money, not to mention time, in this

meration. No only hope his faith in AMAn is justifiea.

vith him, AMLASH told AMWHIP a little different story, 1. e., that he

auld not want to make a public defection statement, because of the

probable repercussions against his friords in Cuba for no good reason.

This area of thinking needs to be examined at length in Paris. A Spanish-

speaking c/o might vell do the trick.

STOCKHOLM:

AMWHIP departed Helsinki for Stockholm on 4 August. Both AMVHIF

said by many before him, they were interesting to hear from a disenchanted

Cuban revolutionary.) He feels that PBPRIME is simply not getting "through"

to the youth and students of Latin America, as are the Communists, and for

this simple reason alone, the next ten years (when these students become

the political and economic leaders in Latin America) will see us lose

the struggle for latin America. We replied by using the old line that

of view, but nevertheless, if we intended to win the strugzle, we must

co as the comunints do, and disregard the archaic and doemed old-line

governments in Latin America. We agreed that this was undoubtedly the

more agressive way to deal with the problet, but that such methods would

leave us open to the old familiar charges of interference in the internal

affairs of sovereign countries. AMASH smiled and replied that fron a

practical viewpoint this didn't make any difference, for if we didn't

act forcefully and soon; there woulan't be any opportunities there for us

to be open to anything! He then cited Venesuela as the next obvious

conmunist victim and thereby a loss of another opportunity for BPRIME.

Obviously AMLASH was correct in much of his thinking, but rather than stand-

ing still with our shoes untied, we gave him the ball by soliciting from

him, as a former student leader and politician, any ideas he might have

for combating the Communists in the strugzle for the minds of Latin

American youth. He replied that he would be glad at any time to disuess

this problem and to offer what ideas and suggestions he could:

: In dealing with AMLASH, one trait of his which confronts the c/o

discussing the various aspects of AMLASH's future role in Cuba; we used

the term "assassinate"

The use of this term, we later learned from

WHIP and from MIASH himself, was most objectionable to the latter, and

he was visibly upset.

It was not the act he objected to, but rather merely

te choice of word used to describe it. "Eliminate" was acceptable, but

obviously the term "'assassinate! had a distasteful connotation. From

ascussions with AMWHTP, this lable of "assassin" had been given to

ALASH after some of his escapades against Batista supporters in the

pre-Castro era. Another example, which AWETP discussed with us, occurred

during a meeting in Mexico City in March 1961, when a KUBARKER said to

AaSH, "T'n prepared to help you in soy ver within my pover" According

to ANWHIP, AMLASH later turned to him, shrugging his shoulders in a manner

of saying, "So I need help from him?" These examples are pointed out

Following this meeting, we went to a small bistro near our botel, phoned

AWHIP, and arranged for a meeting in our hotel room at 1830.

This meeting took place in our hotel room (#41) at the Hotel

Roblin, at 1830. The purpose was merely to net wHIp and re-assure him

that arrangements for AMLASH's meeting were laid on.

We also made

arrangements to give hin his expenses for the trip and account for same

during a meeting the following day. This will permit him to leave for

Milan without delay at the close of our business with AMLASH. He was

getting "nervous", as he called it, and will be glad to get this business

over and done. We agreed. He wanted to remain until the conclusions of

the talke with AMLASH, however, for he felt that he could be of use in

handling AMLASH. We agreed. He did not, of course, want to be in on

any operational discussions, but just to be on hand to guide his

tampomontal "charge"

He was very anxious to meet Wallace A. Growery in order to

point out to him in advance some of the quirks in AMLASH's personally.

In talking to us, AWHIP said that a person with the background of

realized that he is of a different background and make-up (flattery?)

though he is of no Ilttle Importance to us, he is after all, the only one

man with one non's resources:

ANNHIP continually stressed the point that to work with people

like AMLASH, it was necessary to have them first accept a person either

by personal contact over a period of time or on the recommendation of a

good friend. He felt that while it was necessary for us to spend some tine

becoming acquainted with AMLASH, It also might be necessary for Growery

but that-we felt quite enough time had been spent with AMLASH already,

and that the reetings in Paris were going. to get down to business quickly,

During this talk, AWHIP again expressed the feeling that if

AMHIP informed us that WLASH had arrived as promised from Prigue about

they in the future called "Jalme" as they could not readily pronounce

Grovery's true first name) was not able to arrive before that afternoon,

and that a meeting with him could not take place before the 16th. Also,

AWHIP was reminded that he himself had stated that it would be best for

him (ANNIP) to talk to Jaine first in order to explain A lASH's personalit.

AWHIP was unhappy that this meeting could not take place immediateiy,

ALASt's attltude in Parts was easentially that which it had

been during the previous contacts in Scandinavia, that is, changeable as

the weather, varying from occasional flashes of wit and mirth to degrees

of discouragoment and perhaps despondency. He was gererally receptive and

on time. IS one is discussing Cuba, hoteves, he ooriously is very

interested.

Therefore, lu might well be that he is actually so pre-

oscupied sith thoughts about problens at home, that all else is secundary

and treated accordingly. When, on occasion; he "opened ip" a bit with us,

It was obrious that he had done, and was doing, a great deal of thinking

about Cuban problems. It may be that Growery will have much more to say

on this point; as their discussions were in AMASH's native tongue. On

many occasions, ALASH is rather exasperating to deal with, but we feel

that this is a trait of his which is a normal fact of his personality,

and not assumed to try the metal of his case officers. We may-be wrong,

but doubt it.

27.

Fhysical Appearance:

AMASH 1s about 5'1l", weighs abort 175 lbs., dark wavy hair,

thinning noticably on tep and usually needs combing; brown eyes, small,

a]most petulant mouth, small nose, pale complexion, eyes are a little

small for his face and very intense in expressinn. He prefers dressing

informally, and is prone to wearing Jackets sith no tie. (He could

mingle with the typical small town corner-loungers without difficulty.)

When dressed up, he presents a good appearance in a masculine way, and

apparenty iron inhiris stories, does quite weil with the women. Concerning

the question of his being a honosexual, we cannot say whether he has a

hidden bent in this direction, but if he does, he is not at any rate, a

purist. hit rather Ar-De.

28:

Language.

Native Spanish, fair to good Inglish, but with limited vocabulary

He can be successfully conversed with using Inglish, but it has to be

done slowly and with baste constructed sentences. It ds not possible to

be articulate with him, if he is expected to grasp the full meaning of the

conversation.

AMTASH is on good terms with a Pan American stewardess of French

descent who is based in Miami. AWHIP said to us that he thought she was

with us, but we replied we really did not know.

AMLASH also is friendly

with the Cuban dancer Sonia CALERO, whom he telephoned from Paris to give

tie retur date to Havana.

to a limited degree in architecture and historical buildings and sculpture.

32. AMLASH's Original Schedule in Paris.

AMLASH was interested in coming to Parts, executing his busiress

with us in the first three days, then checking into the Cuba House or a

small hotel on the left bank, and socializing with the Cubans at their

Embassy in Paris:

He also wanted to spend some time on the Riviera

before he would see this area again. As it turned out, scheduling for

his taking the Riviera trip, and also postponed his seeing his Cuban

friends.

ite finally went to the Embassy on Tuesday, 21 August to make

what contacts he felt were necessary. As it turned out, Grantges and

most of the men were away on vacations, etc.,

the Embassy was not a problem at all. No plans had been laid on for his

entertairment by the Embassy, and no one, it turred out, was expecting

him at any definite time after his leaving Prague. He felt mich better,

AWHIP reported, after he had made the Embassy appearance and learned

the above facts.

Money Banked by AMLASH.

At our last meeting with AMWHIP. on 23 August, he said that

AMASH had given him $500.00 to be banked in Paris or elsewhere against

a rainy day. It is also interesting to note that while AWHIP said that

any offer of money to AMASH would be an affront to him, IMLASH readily

allowed AMMlIf to pick up the tabs for the hotel rooms and all expenses
