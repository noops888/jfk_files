significant pointe:

(1) KUBARI was criticised for "fooling around for

yenrs" vithout helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

12) the group was to be prepared to denounce

ODYOKS as responsible if the operation falls and belloved that

the resulting scandal would make the Bay of Pigs seen insigal-

ficant; and

(3) AMLASH-3 was in touch with Cuban Intelligence

I believe that the

problen is a more serious and basic one. As indicated in

paragraph 3 of the present nemorandum,

Fidel CASTRO himself

reportedly knew as far back as 1962 that the soup was plotting

against him and, knowing it, enlisted its support.

The contacte at Paris and the matters affecting

Station. - The

"recruitment" of Maureen had been the

subject of an exchange of cables between

and Headquarters

and of discussions at Headquarters between iH/C and WE (See

-1071 (IN 66557) and DIR-10955).

The annoying thing in

this connection

now is that ESPINOSA has talked about it to

ODENVY and ODURGE and the danger that, 11 he i8 indiscreet,

his story about this (and the other matters) could reach some

curious newspaperman. (In thie connection, it appears that the

questionable decision to put Maureen in touch with the AMLASH

roup man made without the knowledge of STOCKIOOD.) ESPINOSA

did not report any critician of the KUBARKers at

but 1t

in evident that the AMLASH group knows more about them than

we might wish.

What 18 new and of concern from ESPINOSA about

matters in Paris 18 his story of ANTHIP 1 and UNSNAFU-19

deslings.

The questions raised about AlWHIP -I are of mutual

concern siso to Headquarters which has been running him and

which he has visited often.

(On the occasion of my

previous trip to Madrid on the QUiOPS-l case,

ChOlERY had voiced

his doubts about the whole group and specifically about AlWHIP-1

and his connection with UNSNAFU-19.)

At issue are two bagic

points, the knowledge

on the part. of UNSNAFU-19 about SUBARK's

connection with AMWHIP-I and the charge that ANNHIP-I has been

defrauding KUBARK in the jevelry transaction.

Also to be kept

in mind is the fact that ODENVY has an office in Paris which

well sight have been informed of the allegations and which might

have been asked for comments - although ODENVY policy always

has bees to stay away from any investigation of other government

"gencies unders specifically directed by the Attorney General

to investigate.
