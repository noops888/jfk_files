Legat Paris has requeste outstanding with theDST, DGSE, and

Prefecture of Police regarding all documents supplied by fax to

Legat Paris.

Each agency has advised that decisions must be made

at high levels (for example, DGSE'& Director must review the

matter, and he is currently out of town, the package for the

Prefecture of Police had to be conveyed in the form of a written

cormal request and hand-delivered to the Prefect

note that the surete Nationale no longer existal (Soffica). Ne

Legat Paris will follow this matter closely and report results as

received.

However, FBIHQ should bear in mind that the problems

of old archived documents, compounded with the need for

translation, will cause certain inevitable delays.

We greatly appreciate the responsiveness of the task force in

helping remedy problems of poor quality or partially conveyed

documents.
