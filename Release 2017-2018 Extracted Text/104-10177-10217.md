The

Incident

. by Taylor Branch and John Rothchild

How two mild-mannered reporters, on the

trail of a Washington bomber,

landed in Caracas and ran afoul of the

Venezuelan secret service, warring

Department, the C.I.A., the F.B.I.

=::

Well, that all depends on who you talk to and how

paranoid they are," says Branch. "Our friends in

Washington used to be simple journalists and policy

analysts. Now they are three-pay-phone men. That

means you can't call them without using three pay

phones. You call them up and all they'll say is 'phone

number ore." Then they so to pay phone number one

and you call them again. Then they ask you for the

number of another pay phope near yours, and they call

you on that one."

"What do you talk about?".

«Things like pay phones and letter bombs and wheth-

..er the Feds can be trusted. The last time I called they

told me we would be walking into four nests of known

killers: the Cuban exiles in Venezuela, the Venezuelan

secret police, the C.I.A. and the Chilean-secret police."

Rothchild does not look reassured. He does not like

the way Branch reels off the life histories of all the

C.L.A. Cubans he has known, especially since the point

is, always that the situation is -too cociplicated for

words. "Tell me,"" Rothchild says gravely, "did you tel)

your mother you were soing to Venezuera?

Branch squirms at the cruel question. He wants to

appear as knowledgesble and confident as possible, be t

cause he has dragged Rothchild into this adventure on

less than a day's notice. "No, I didn't teil ber," he.ad-

mits. "It's too complicated. But I think well only have

one point of danger."

"When's the point of danger?"

"Yell, we may get into the prison and get our an-

sirers," Branch replies, "or we may get shem from pro

ple in the Venezuelan governmeat. Fither war, we'll

know who did the murders and who paid the killers

and what other murders they've done. That's that we

hope, anyway. If we get that information, we'll be hot
