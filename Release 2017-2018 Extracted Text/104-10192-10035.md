EOMB HABANA: USING A B-25. AIRCRAFT, EXPLAINING THAT SUCH AN OPERATION

WOULD "MAKE A GIG SPLASH." (FIELD COMMENT: FOR PREVIOUS REPORTING

THE AIRCRAFT HAS EVADED UNITED STATES AUTHORITIES, BOMBED HASANA,

AND RETURNED TO THE MIAMI AREA, BOSCH INTENDS TO EXPUSE THE. OPERATION

AS HAVING BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. THIS

ALLEGATION, HE FEELS, WOULD FACILITATE HIS OBTAINING THE RELEASE OF THE

CREW.
