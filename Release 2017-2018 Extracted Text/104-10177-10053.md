Marina and Los NorToy 053 D

Tho subject of the OSWALUs was Introducod Into tho

Interrogation during a discussion nbout the difficulty a

Soriet citizon, uho marries a foreignor, oncountors in

attempting to loave tho USSR 18 the KCA chooses (for some

roason) not to pormit the soviet citizen to emigrato.

Subjoot stated that lt goos althout saying that prior to

rocolving KGB'g

sanction not a single Sovlot oltlion, wether

ho or she

1s married to a foreignos, would be allowed to

leave

, the USSR.

Asked 1f the oase of Marina OSWALD's departuro from

the Soviet Union was typical, Subject roplied that hor

departure from tbe Soviet Union was noitber typical nor usual,

particularly in vlor of the faot that hor husband, Loo Harvey

OSWALD, was a vory strango individual.

He had been in Cuba,

and then came to

the Soviet Union not'as a tourist, but as

an American defootor who renounced his Anertean eltizenship.

and attempted to become a Russian oltizen.

This In Itsolf

is unusual for an Amorican - it 1s not typical and very rare

for an Amarioan to do s0, and Subject bolloved that an

•American doing what OSWALD did (seaking Soviet citizenship

and renouncing Amorican oftizenship) could only do so because

In answer to a request for his opinion rogarding the

DSWALD case,. Subject said that all of his information was based

only on what was known to everyone who road the newspapers

attor the KENNEDY assasination and on what he read in a con

donsed version of the Warren Report while he was in Wostern

Europe.

When pressed for his porsonal opinion he said it was

n very

unusual situation.

Normally a Soviet cittzon (like

Marina) would not bo allowed to leave the Soviot Union, in

faot the Sorlot authoritles would try in some way to convince

the ottison not to leave.

However, If a Soviet married a

foreigner.

and insisted on leaving he or she could always, as

a last resort, be refused an exit visa.

There have been

casos whore & Soviot oltizen marrled a foreigner and received

bowever,

in such cases the Soviet authorities

have concaded to the oxit visa roquests only because they folt

that the foroign spouse may havo had some influence, and could

havo croated adverse publioity for the Soviet Government had

the exlt visa not been granted.

This was definitoly not so

1r OSWALD's case.

OSWALD could not Insist that Marina be

granted an

exist visa since bo, was not in a position to do so.

and consequently the Soviot authorities sere not compolled to

do so unless they spoolfically wanted to lot her go to America

wIth OSWALD.

When asked to st1ll furtbor elaborato on bis bollois

rogarding the caso, Subject stated that in this case (OSWALD's).

Subjoct. couldn't guess,

and in ordor to come to any kind

valid conclusion he would bave to know something (faotunl).

which he doesn't, His opinion, however, is striotly an

without any basis or fact.

the KGD kopt OSSALD In "thalr flold of vision" and

undoubtedly worked with him.

To Subjoct it Is unthinkable

since it

that the KGB would miss such an opportu stiLD) for work

always considors using poryong (such ay

o1 thor dirootly in intolligenco, as an agent, or in any

othor way "to infilot damago to

tho Wost"..

iskod whathor the assasination of President KENNEDY

nould be considered as

"boing damaging to

the west", Subject

ansverod in the affirmative.

Subjoot explained that the existence of a government

the Unitod States 1s a throat to the Soviet regime.

The Unltod Statos is an example to

the rost of the world

(Soviets Includod) that people can live, survive, and have

a highor standard of llving in a democracy.

Therefore, the

Soviet Union tried, and tries,

cut the U.S. Government

down at every opportunity.

Sinco• President KENNEDY was looked

many In the. Soviet Union

as a popular personality,

KENNEDY's porsonal attraction further raised this feeling

that living in a democracy had its benefits, to an even higher

lovel with the general population of

the Soviet Union.

When asked 1f it was possible that KGB could or would

ever sanction suoh an

answered

operation

(the assasination) Subject

"yes, at that time (KHRUSHCHEV's) It could have"

KHRUSHCHEV was considered by Subjeot to. be an ignorant

Individual who was willing to take risks and adventurous

under

takings.

subjeet said,

howeter,

that this could never occur

under

the present Soriat leadership.

Subject

considered that

the decision to carry

out such an operation, (the assasination)

could not have been

made by the Chairman

of

the KGB

since he

does not

. possess such

authority, and,

therefore, could only

hate

been made by KFRUSHCHEV himself.

Subject was asked if such an operation might not have

Involted a terrifle risk which could have possibly rosulted

in an armed contaiet between the tro nations, had soviet

involvement been proven by the Americans.

Subject felt that

aven 1$ the Amorieans did acouse the Soviot Government of

complicity in the assastration,

the Soviet Government would

cortainly deny such an American accusation, olaiming that the

Americans were using OSWALD, a orazy

man who had been in the

Soviet Union,

would say that the accusation was a provocation,

and in all probability vould ropudiate such American claims.

To undorline.

his point, Subject mentioned that even

though OSWALD was

In the Soviet Union, and was suspected

because he was in Cuba, nothing happened and the Sovlet Union

wasn't accused by the Americans.
