Counselor of the Spanish: Embassy, who intolerably abused the

diplomatic immunity and privileges granted him and used them

for purposes, like those cited, that are very different from the

functions assigned to him.

"With the purpose of documenting what has already been

indicated, I take the liberty of informing you below in detail, of

the charges which have been brought against Counselor JAINE CALDEVILLA,

proved in an authentic and irrefutable manner, and which compel

us to formally and expressly request his immediate departure from

the country persona non grata.

"The main activites of Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA are

of ideological diversionism and the recruitment of agents and

counterrevolutionaries for the Central Intelligence Agency, tasks

in which he has availed himself of the very close collaboration of

his secretary, Miss CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ ((A)) .

"Since February 1959, Counselor CALDEVILLA has undertaken the

job of recruiting members of the then Rebel Army, among them the

traitor ALDO VERA((A)), MARIO MARRERO((A)), and AGUSTIN PARRADA((A)) .

The latter, once his activities were discovered, found it propitious

to flee the country to avoid prosecution.

"Along this same line, he also used the aforementioned Miss

CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ, instructing her to infiltrate student

organizations for the purpose of creating diversionism in the

ideological order, and she established,

for this purpose, intimate

relations with Mr. PEDRO LUIS BOITELL( (A)): ex-President of the

Miss JIMENEZ GOMEZ went there and carried out military and political

espionage activities. The data and information that she obtained

on that occasion weze transmitted to Counselor JAIME CALDEVILIA,

an attempt against the life of the then First Deputy Chairman of

the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. ANASTAS MIKOYAN,,

a guest in Cuba, for which purpose he delivered arms to a group

of counterrevolutionarly elements.

It was not executed, according

to what Counselor CALDEVILLA himself claims, because of the

cowardice of the assassins, He also sought refuge and protection in

the home of his collaborator JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ ((A)), FOr MI. ISRAEL

ZAMORA PEREZ((A)), a fugitive from Cuban authorities for plotting

an attempt against the life of the Vice Prime Minister and Minister

of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, Commander RAUL CASTRO RUZ,

and offices of the Cuban State. The former went to work in the

offices of the National College of Architects, where she established

contacts with numerous professionals. to induce them to desert, as

well as to obtain data and intormation from the Congress of the

International Union of Architects, where she worked as a simultaneous

interpreter.

for civic resistance and strengthening of the Revolutionary Student

Directorate, and the latter, a CIA agent.

political prisoners and counterrevolutionaries, inciting them to

organizations.

espionage network for the illicit procurement of military, economic

and political information and in penetrating the Cuban-Spanish

having offered, on one occasion, to supply to one group rifles

the other maintains relations with the well-known counterrevolutionary

leader MANUEL ARTIME, whom: Mr. VERGARA visited in Miami sometime

before the mercenary
