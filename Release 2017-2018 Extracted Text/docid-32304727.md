RE:

Re Bureau airtel to Cleveland, 4/16/64.

Informant was contacted on 4/25/64, at which

he was questioned as to what group he considers himself to be a

member of, and he advised he believes he became a member of the

"Calabrese

Organization", which in the Youngstown area has as

its active head, DOMINICK MALLAMO and PAUL ROMEO Of Campbell,

Ohio, being the retired "head.

He advised that at no time during

the initiation ceremony did ROMEO use the words "La Cosa Nostra"

however, he did tell informant he was going to make him "one of.

He also stated that to date, no other superiors have been

Identified to him, nor has he obtained any info as to the connect-

¡on of this group

with groups in other cities.

It is to be recalled that ROMEO, during the initiation

ceremony, asked the informant, however, if he would be able to

travel to Steubenville and Cleveland, O., for him.

Continued contacts will be had with the informant in

an effort to resolve those questions raised in re airtel.
