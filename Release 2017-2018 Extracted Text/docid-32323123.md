ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DL -6-S

AT 15-975468510/KSR

(JFK)

On 12/11/61 SA W. HARLAN BROWN received, in person,

a handwritten report dated 12/10/61 from DL-6-S.

This report

has been serialized as 134-1A-644.

Informant determined on 12/10/61 that on that date J0E

LANDIN contacted GILBERT C. GARCIA of Fort Worth. GARCIA is

North District Director of PASO and former state chairman of

the American G. I. Forun. LANDIN asked i1 there was a forum

chapter in Slaton, Texas. He wanted to know if anything was

being done in Slaton in regards to the barring of Mexicans and

LatinAmericans from a swimming pool there.

GARCIA said there was a forum chapter in Slaton and it

was through it that the issue had come to light.

He indicated

he was taking an active part in it and would be'in Slaton the

first of the week. GARCIA said they were trying to settle the

issue in Slaton as quietly as possible and advised LANDIN not

to print anything about it.. Three attorneys had gone to

Washington in connection with the Slaton case. They were ED

IDAR, BOB SANCHEZ and ROEL.

Funds were needed badly, he added.

Any contributions could be mailed to him or to Dr. GARCIA in

Corpus:

The contributions were to be marked as for Poll Tax

drive expenses.

He urged LANDIN to contact both PASO and the

forum in Dallas and ask them for contributions for the Poll

Tax sale drive.

Informant had no additional information.
