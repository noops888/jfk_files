PA BUSINE

It should be noted that the above communication

sets forth information obtained 9/28/64 from Lt. LESLIE

VAN BUSKIRK, Intelligence Unit, Dade County SO, Miami,

to the effect that he, BUSKIRK, recently received infor-

mation from a confidential informant he considers reliable,

that subject TRAFFICANTE had failed in his attempts to

take over bolita operations in Miami, and was "giving it

up as a bad job."

BUSKIRK's informant said he had heard

that TRAFFICANTE planned to move his headquarters to

Orlando, Florida,

where he could operate without as much

interference from law enforcement officers.

The above possibility has been very discreetly

explored with the following sources on the dates indicated,

and none of them possess any pertinent information which

would tend to confirm the information:

Lt. JAMES GOODE, NA, Vice Squad, Orlando PD,

Orlando, Fla,, on 10/7 and 12, 1964.

Detective Sergeant WILLIAM E. BRANCH, NA, Vice

Squad, Orlando, Fla. PD, on 10/13/64.

TP 67-C, Orlando, on 10/12/64.

TP 104-C, Orlando, on 10/5/64.

During the course of a contact with PCI

jat Cocoa, Fla. on 6/30/64, he advised SA LOREN C.

BROOKS that HARLAN ALEXANDER BLÄCKBURN is now "complete?,"

independent, and is no longer connected with the 'MAFIA.

This

PCI, who has been closely associated with BLACK-

BURN in Brevard County, stated that about a year and a

half

ago, BLACKBURN "broke off with

meaning the Italians in Tampa. PCI

the "Tayl

explained

that

he, informant, first became acquainted with BLACK-

BURN's Cuba operation during about 1/62, when BLACKBURN

was being banked by an Italian in Tampa.

Further, the above PCI stated that he could not

recall this Italian's name, and does not believe he ever

met him.

He does know that this man did have the "Tropi-

cana" in Havana before CASTRO threatened to kill him. He

returned to the U. S. after hiding in Cuba for two months.

This man kept a lot of money in a trunk in his home, and

charged BLACKBURN a high rate of interest when BLACKBÜRN

found it necessary to borrow.

PCI seemed to recall that

this man also had

a home in

• Miami, and knows that he had:

a brother active in

the business.

It is his recollection

that these brothers also had two or three clubs in Tampa

that were closed down. He said this individual may have

been named "SANTO."

The Tampa Office will, of course, continue to

follow this development closely and discreetly through

PCI

Jat Cocoa, and other reliable sources in the

Orlando área.

In the

meantime, however, it is requested

that the Miami Office maintain close liaison with It.

LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK, Intelligence Unit, Dade County SO,

Miami, for any further specific information the latter's

informant may receive in this matter.
