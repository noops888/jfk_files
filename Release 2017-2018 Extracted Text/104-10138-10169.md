also included

information the

had received

from ESDEW-1 on 8 June. ESDEW- 1

said thai he

had been providing information on ZIMERI to the

Guatemalan government for the past six months or

He claimed that two Americans were involved

with ZIMERI, one of them who runs a guard service

in Miami. ESDEW-1 did not mention names but

described one of the Americans as about six

feet

four inches and weighing about 230 pounds.

4. The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends

with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United

States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the

United States for possible use in

Guatemala?

d. Does ZIMERI receive any kind of preferen-

tial

treatment by U. S. authorities which

permit him to carry firearms, as weld as

to purchase arms and ammunition for

shipment to Guatemala?

e. Any information on Robert and Gerald

HEMMING?

5.

On 19 June 1976

'the Guatemala Desk advised

that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State

Department.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent

variations of the name of ZIMERI. or Robert HEMMING.

. From the name, physical description, activity, and

alleged employment, it is apparent that Gerald Patrick HEMING

is identical with

Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JMAVE.

On

Muniono Decasions since ai least tho carly isco has bedo

had claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 450),

Exank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a

long-time record of

falsely claiming Agency affiliation.

the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba

but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Communist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

9.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, •Jr-;

and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup d'etat

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John E.

Kennedy

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the najor

links attempted by the authors

is through Everett Howard HUNT,

Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugone

HALL.

Loran Bugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

GARRISON

shortly

interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
