Dear Mr. Horton:

I am writing to you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an

independent Federal Agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The Review

Board, whose members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is

charged with collecting records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The

Review Board is not seeking to reach any conclusions regarding the assassination, but is

primarily concerned with identifying, clarifying, locating, and making available

assassination records. I am enclosing some explanatory material about the Review

Board and its mandate.

As part of our mandate, we have been reviewing records that originated with the

Central Intelligence Agency. Several of the records relate to the investigation of Lee

Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City and his alleged association with the Fair Play for

Cuba Committee and anti-Castro organizations. We have some questions about these

subjects as well as a related event that involved James Angleton traveling to Mexico

City in 1971 to acquire Win Scott's papers. We hope that you may be able to assist us in

determining the existence of various assassination records connected with the events

described above.

We would like to request a meeting to discuss the aforementioned issues. We invite

you to come to our offices in Washington, but we would be more than willing to meet

you at your home or another convenient location. We will be contacting you in the near

future to arrange for a convenient time for you.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Langelle:

I am writing you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an independent

Federal Agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The Review Board, whose

Top Secret, SCI clearances. The Review Board is not seeking to reach any conclusions

regarding the assassination, but is primarily concerned with identifying, clarifying,

locating, and making available assassination records. I am enclosing some explanatory

material about the Review Board and its mandate.

As Michelle Combs mentioned in her telephone call last Tuesday, we would like very

much to discuss your work experiences in Moscow from 1957-1959 with you. We

believe that your past in-depth knowledge of the Moscow Embassy and its procedures

may assist the ARRB in our attempts to clarify the historical record in this area.

Before talking with you, we would like to make certain that you would feel free to

discuss fully all relevant aspects of your work in Moscow. To the extent that you think

that discussion of your work might possibly involve classified or sensitive matters, we

would like to resolve such concerns in a way that would provide you with whatever

assurance that you need that you would not be improperly divulging classified

information. If you feel discussing this subject with the Review Board would constitute

disclosure of any information that is still classified, we will be happy to initiate a

discussion between you and the appropriate officials to address any concerns you may

• have.

One of the members of our staff, Michelle Combs, will be calling to arrange a mutually

agreeable time and place for an interview. Should you wish to contact us in response to

Russia House has looked at Michelle Combs' memo on her interview of Russell Langelle.

The only areas of concern they had, which they said they could not comment on knowledgeably, are:

• The mention of George Payne Winters, Jr. They do not know if he is overt.

• The mention of the HTLINGUAL program in the last paragraph of page two. They are not familiar with this program and don't

know if this program is overt/as been publicly acknowledged by the Agency.

If you could check into these two matters or tell me where to get the answers, I would appreciate it. Thanks.

OVERFLYING RUSSIA

153

The next thing we tried was something called a Salisbury

screen, a metallic grid applied to the airplane's undercarriage

in the hope of deflecting incoming radar beams, but it worked

only at some frequencies and altitudes and not at others.

Kelly thought it was more practical to try special iron fer-

rite paints that would absorb

a radar ping rather than

bounce it back to the sender. The paints were moderately ef-

fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's

outer skin and we experienced overheating engine problems.

But the paint lowered the radar cross section by one order of

magnitude, so we decided to give it a try. We called these

specially painted airplanes "dirty birds" and shipped the first

one out for flight testing in April 1957. Our test pilot, Bob

Sieker, took the U-2 up to over seventy thousand feet and

suddenly radioed that he was experiencing rapid airframe

heat buildup. Moments later his engine blew out and the face-

plate blew off Bob's oxygen mask as his pressure suit in-

stantly inflated. The U-2 dove straight down and crashed. It

took us three days to locate the wreckage and Bob's body. An

autopsy revealed that above seventy thousand feet he had

suffered acute hypoxia and lost consciousness in only ten

seconds. The culprit that killed him was a defective faceplate

clasp that cost fifty cents.

The CIA was so desperate to buy time for these Soviet over-

flights that Bissell got Kelly to sequester four of our test flight

engineers and have them write a bogus flight manual for a U-2

twice as heavy as ours and with a maximum altitude of only

fifty thousand feet that carried only scientific weather gear in

its bay. The manual included phony instrument panel photos

with altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor

limits. Four copies were produced and then artificially aged

with grease, coffee stains, and cigarette burns. How or if the

agency got them into Soviet hands only Mr. B knew, and he

never told.

It is our understanding that you handled, organized, and worked with former

Counterintelligence Chief James J. Angleton's files for over thirty years and that you

had access to his safes and private vault. We would like very much to discuss this

subject with you, and believe that your past in-depth knowledge of Mr. Angleton's files

this area of inquiry. We would like very much to discuss this subject with you, and

believe that your experiences and recollections may assist ARRB in our attempts to

We would like very much to discuss your work experiences in Moscow from 1959-1961

with you, particularly as it pertained to the USSR residènce of Lee Harvey Oswald. We

have reviewed the transcripts of your testimony to the Warren Commission and to the

House Select Committee on Assassinations. We believe that your knowledge of Oswald

and the Moscow Embassy may assist the ARRB in our attempts to clarify the historical

record in this area.

One of the members of our staff, Dr. Michelle Combs, will be calling to arrange a

mutually agreeable time and place for an interview. We anticipate being in the Boston

area in the near future and would easily be able to visit with you

if that would

be most convenient for you.

Before talking with you, we would like to make certain that you would feel free to

discuss fully all relevant aspects of your work in Moscow. To the extent that you think

that discussion of your work might possibly involve classified or sensitive matters, we

would like to resolve such concerns in a way that would provide you with whatever

assurance that you need that you would not be improperly divulging classified

information. In the course of our interviews with other persons, we have arranged with

NOTE FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: JFK Board/Ann Goodpasture

1. At the request of Jeremy Gunn, General Counsel of

the Assassination Records Review Board, I called retired CIA

employee Ann I. Goodpasture today.

The reason for the call was to advise her that Gunn

planned to contact her to arrange an interview about the

Kennedy assassination. Fred Wickham, DO, had agreed that I

make the call.

I explained to Ms. Goodpasture the role of the

Board and the purpose of the interview, and offered to

provide any assistance.

She said that she would be willing

to be interviewed, but did not recall the details of events

around the time of the assassination. She asked that she

receive an official statement from CIA releasing her from

her secrecy agreement for purposes of the interview, which I

agreed to obtain.

3. Ms. Goodpasture said that she had plans to visit

Washington in November and could be available for the

interview then.

She will call me when her plans are firm.

4. I relayed the above to Gunn, who said that he would

call Goodpasture sometime in the next two days.

Interview with Russell A. Langelle

On August 21, 1997, Russell A. Langelle, senior CIA officer in Moscow from 1957 to

1959 was interviewed by Michelle Combs. The interview was not recorded.

• Mr. Langelle provided an overview of life in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow from

1957-1959. He outlined his duties and activities as the embassy security officer

and as the senior CIA officer in Moscow during that time period.

• Mr. Langelle noted that he had no contact with Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow

and did not remember ever hearing the name until after the assassination of

President Kennedy.

In discussing his duties in Moscow, Mr. Langelle said that he had been sent to

- Moscow specifically to meet with GRU Lieutenant Colonel Pyotr Popov,

recruited in Vienna in 1952, who was then working as an agent-in-place within

the GRU, the Soviet military intelligence service. Langelle explained that

meeting Popov in the Soviet capital was his number one priority and that he was

given instructions not to draw attention to himself in any way which might

endanger Popov.

Mr. Langelle noted that his other responsibilities for CIA included finding,

checking, and locating potential dead drops, and the general assessment of the

various Soviet officials he met as potential recruitment targets. He emphasized

that his activities on behalf of the CIA were very passive and that none of these

activities was allowed to overshadow the importance of meeting Popov safely.

He made no attempts to recruit any Soviets for fear of calling attention to himself

as a CIA officer and thus endangering Popov.

When asked about other CIA officers in the embassy, Mr. Langelle said that he

had a loose supervisory role over the other officers in the embassy in that he

knew each of them (they did not necessarily know each other as CIA officers)

and generally what they were doing. However, Langelle emphasized that he did

not know the specifics of anyone's work but his own and that there was no

"station" which functioned as any kind of a unit. The CIA officers in Moscow

functioned as individuals, acting on instructions from Headquarters, with no

coordination of their activities in-country.

Mr. Langelle thought that it was likely that George Payne Winters, Jr. had his

own communications channel with Headquarters and that possibly the other

officers did too. He stated that he was never instructed to pass a message from

Headquarters to any other officer and that no officer ever asked him to pass any

information on to Headquarters.

When asked about CIA files, Mr. Langelle noted that the few CIA files that

existed in Moscow were kept in one drawer of his safe and that only he had

access to them. No one else had the combination. He said that to the best of his

recollection, the files consisted mainly of communications materials such as one-

time-pads, a few records of dead drop locations, and communications protocol.

Mr. Langelle explained that tourists and defectors were never part of his

responsibilities in Moscow either as the embassy security officer or as a CIA

officer. He said that he had no contact with any of the American defectors. Mr.

Langelle explained that any potential counterintelligence risk from an American

defector would not have been viewed as important enough to expose Langelle's

presence as a CIA officer.

Asked about the CIA's legal traveller program, Mr. Langelle said that he knew

about the existence of the program but that he had no contact with any of its

participants. He thought it possible that George Payne Winters, Jr. had some

contact or role in the program because he had many contacts in the Russian

community. Mr. Langelle emphasized that he had no specific knowledge

whether Winters did have a role in the legal traveller program.

Mr. Langelle thought that it was possible that the military attaches would have

met with any defector with a military background, but that he did not know if

any of the attaches had met with any of the defectors. He also thought it was

possible that an attache could have taken Oswald to the upper (restricted) floors

for counseling but again, he did not have any specific knowledge of such an

occasion.

When asked about the HTLINGUAL program, Mr. Langelle said that he knew

about the mail opening program. He noted that he was the only person in the

embassy who knew that American non-diplomatic pouch mail was seen by both

the Soviets, through regular KGB screening, and the CIA through HTLINGUAL.
