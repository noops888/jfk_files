1. Will contact logical informants and sources

in an effort to ascertain subject's current activities and

connections with regard to the Cuban government.

2. Will follow and report deportation proceedings

regarding the subject.

ADMINISTRATIVE

It is to be noted that a 134 file was opened on

the subject on 4/23/59, and was closed on 9/16/59, due to

the fact that. although

PEREZ voluntarily furnished infor-

mation which was of assistance in the location of the

individuals in whom the Miami Office was interested,

investigation conducted toward the establishment of PEREZ's

reliability reflected that he was not considered reliable

or trustworthy by individuals who have been in contact

with him. Also, it was stated that he could not be depended

upon to furnish

all information in his possession if with-

holding some would be to his advantage.

This report is classified "confidential" inasmuch

as it contains information the disclosure of which could

reasonably result in the identification of confidential

informants of continuing value.
