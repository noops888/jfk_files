FLA,

On April 8, 1960, GILBERT BARRERAS, PSI, a Cuban

exile residing in the Miami area who has furnished reliable

Information in the past, advised that on April 7, 1960,

CUBA

FERNANDO

XBUSTO, Cuban exile in Miami, accidentally met LUIS

CONTE AGUERO at Miami International Airport, and asked CONTE

if he had seen EMILIO and ANDRES RIVERO, his half-brothers.

CONTE told BUSTO he had not talked with them, because he did

not have their telephone numbers or addresses. BUSTO there-

upon furnished CONTE with the telephone number of EMILIO

FLA

RIVERO, and CONTE then talked with EMILIO's wife, ]

RACQUEL, Me ivero

He told her he was leaving Miami for New York in

a special

ELA

airplane with JULES PUBOIS, newspaperman. CONTE planned to

FLA

find an apartment in New York City, where he had already

found employment, not, described.

He disclosed that his wife

and mother and one or two children would arrive in Miami,

possibly during the week of April 18, 1960, and they would

continue to New York to live with CONTE.

BARRERAS said that CONTE is suspected by EMILIO

RIVERO as being pro-FIDEL CASTRO because in public interview,

MM 105-2484

CONTE had not talked about CASTRO nor attacked him. CONTE had

merely stated there were some Communists in the Cuban Govern-

ment.

He said EMILIO suspects CONTE may be a "plant" for some

ted hit to suspect

unknown purpose, possibly similar to that played by WILLIAM

ALEXANDER MORGAN in the Trinidad Incident, on behalf of CASTRO.

It is to be recalled that WILLIAM ALEXANDER MORGAN, a

former United States adventurer, participated in the double-

cross at Trinidad, Cuba, which resulted in the apprehension

and death of a number of anti-CASTRO revolutionists.

On April 15, 1960, MM 715-S, who is in close contact

with various officials of the CASTRO government, stated he had no rea-

son to suspect that CONTE AGUERO is a "plant" for the Cuban

Government.

On the same date, MM 639-S, who is also in close

contact with a number of Cuban officials, including several who

are engaged in intelligence activities, advised that he had

received no information indicating that CONTE is working for the

Cuban Government surreptitiously.

(CONCEAL)

On April 15, 1960, Colonel MARIANO FAGET, PSI,

former

Chief of the Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities

(BRAC), and who is closely associated with most of the leading

anti-CASTRO leaders in the Miami area, advised that he had heard

rumors concerning the possibility that CONTE might be a "plant"

of the CASTRO government. He said that he had made a number of

inquiries and had turned up no information which would tend to

support such a suspicion.

He expressed the opinion that CONTE

is ninety-five per cent (95%) against CASTRO.

FLA

On April 18, 1960, and again on May 13, 1960, Mrs.

ADA, FALK, 433 N. W. 24th Avenue, Miami, who requested specifically

that her identity be treated confidentially, advised she had

received no more information reflecting upon this matter. She
