Re Miami telephone call to Chicago 10/13/65.v

On 9/28/65, MM 1003C-TE advised that SAM FRANK

URBANA of Chicago and another individual, unknown to the

informant, had recently arrived in the Miami area and

advised VINCENT JAMES PALMISANO, Miami top hoodlum,

they were representing JACK CERONE and ROSS PRIO of Chicago

and were going to "take over" Policy and Numbers in the

South Florida area now under the control of HYMIE MARTIN

of Miami. URBANA said that, as a front, he and his

associate were purchasing a

local nightclub in Miami known

as the "500 Club," which establishment caters to both

Negro and white clientele.

Preliminary inquiry conducted at the 500 Club,

2724 NW 36th St. Miami, on 10/8/65, revealed that

approximately two weeks

prior thereto,

the ownership of

the club changed hands from the Brooks

Management Corp.

to the "SAMBO, Inc." upon the death of the owner, SAv

BROOKS. A caretaker of this club identified a photo

of URBANA as one of two individuals from Chicago who

recently purchased this establishment.

At that time,

URBANA made an appearance at the club,

interviewed by

a Bureau Agent, and denied that he owned

any part of the

500 Club, stating that he came to Miami for the purpose of

establishing permanent residence and was

"looking for

something legitimate"

for purchase.
