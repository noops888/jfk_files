MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Ramparts: John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr:,

Samuel George CUMMINGS, and

INTERARMCO

1: Ramparts of June 1967, Vol. 5, No. 12, pp. 28-29, contains

the following passages about Subjects:

"The day after the assassination, Gary Underhill left

Washington in a hurry.. Lite in the evening he showed up

at the home of friends in New Jersey. He was very agitated.

A small clique within the CIA was responsible for the as

sassination, he confided, and he was afraid for his life and

probably would have to leave the country. Less than six

months later Underhill was found shot to death in his

Washington apartment. The coroner ruled it suicide.

"J. Garrett Underhill had been an intelligence agent

during World War Il and was a recognized authority on limi-

ted warfare and small arms. A researcher and writer on

military affairs, he was on a first-name basis with many of

the top brass in the Pentagon. He was also on intimate terms

with a number of high-ranking CLA officials--he was one of

the Agency's 'un-people' who perform special assignments.

At one time he had been a friend of Samuel Cummings of

Interarmco, the arms broker that numbers among its cug-

tomers the CLA and, ironically, Klein's Sporting Goods of

Chicago, from whence /sig/ the mail-order Carcano alleg-

edly was purchased by Oswald.

"The friends whom Underhill visited say he was sober

but badly shook. They say he attributed the Kennedy

murder to a ClA clique which was carrying on a lucrative

racket in gun-running, narcotics and other contraband.

and manipulating political intrigue to serve its own ends.

Kennedy supposedly gor wind that something was going on

and was killed before he could "blow the whistle on it'

Although the friends had always known Underhill to be

perfectly rational and objective, they at first didn't take

his account seriously. 'I think the main reason was.

explains the husband, "that we couldn's believe that the

CIA could contain a corrupt element every bit as ruth

leac--and more efficient--as the mafia."

"The verdict of suicide in Underhill's death is by no

means convincing. His body was found by a writing

collaborator, Asher Brynes of the New Republic. He

had been shot behind the left car, and an automatic pistol

was under his left side. Odd, says Brynes, because

Underhill was right-handed. Brynes thinks the pistol

was fitted with a silencer, and occupants of the apartment

building couid not recall hearing a shot. Underhill obri-

ously had been dead several days.

"Garry Underhill's chilling story is hardly implausible.

As a spy apparatus the CIA is honeycombed with self-

contained cliques operaring without any seal central control...."

2. A check of Agency records has yielded the following information

about John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr.

a. DPOB: 7 August 1915, Brooklyn..

from Harvard in 1937.

dated 1 June 1965, staled that at that time there was

"no record of a current operational intereat in Subject."

menta by the BND, and that these included lists of

Soviet and Bloc arms for procurement. I was also

reported that he showed a BND representative a copy
