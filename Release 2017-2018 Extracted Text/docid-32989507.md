Memo Number 56

RE: SENSTUDY 75

NW 54970

to intelligence

may act to retro curent and tone it ye:

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

staff has interviewed several former employees and it is

anticipated that many more such personnel will be contacted.

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the

Committee and we wish to assist and facilitate any investigations

undertaken by the Committee with respect to the FBI. However,

we do have an obligation to insure that sensitive sources

and methods and ongoing sensitive investigations are fully

protected. Should any former employees contact the office

and have any question regarding his obligation not to

divulge information obtained by virtue of his past FBI

employment, he should be instructed to contact Legal Counsel,

FBIHQ, by collect call. Our conversations with former

employees must be in keeping with our pledge.

It is believed

that such a procedure would insure proper protection and

also facilitate the work of the SSC.

The above procedure also applies to current

employees of this office,

however, contact with the Legal

Counsel

should be handled through

. the SAC.
