A. PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

Name Change

No information has ever been received why the MANNARINO family

name was legally changed from RUGGIERO to MANNARIND.

Marriage of GABRIEL MANNARINO

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO'S wife, JEAN, had no choice in her

selection of mate.

The marriage was arranged between her

father, FRANK AMATO, of Braddock, Pa., and KELLY MANNARINO.

JOSEPH PETER MANNARINO, aka, JOJO - Brother

JOJO MANNARINO, who suffers from a palsy-like twitching and

from severe stammering, is a "nut" and

"con man." He has

dissipated the fortune

of his wife, HAZEL, widow of motion

picture actor LEWIS STONE, in just a few years.

KELLY and

SAM MANNARINO allow JOJO to come to New Kensington occasionary

on the conditon that he "stays out of trouble,

but JOJO always

does something to get Into trouble, such as writing worthless

checks, and is forced to leave town.

After such visits to

New Kensington, KELLY and/or SAM MANNARINO ordinarily make

good the amount of the worthless checks written by JoJo.

ABE SEID, aka, Al Ross

Although AL ROSS has the reputation

of having killed

on many occasions, It is not belleved that he deserves that

reputation.

He has never been known to brag about any kill-

ings.

ROSS, who is under order of deportation to his native

Russia, is worried that the U. S. Government will find some

nation which will accept him.

ROSS is very much in love with

his wife, MORMA, who is a nymphomaniac currently residing on

Florida. ROSS gives the appearance

of being a

taking part'in any illegal activity to obtain money, even

though he is in serious financial straits.

JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard and most

trusted lieutenant.

KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his

protege and made him a "don." After FONTANA's marriage about

a year and a half ago, he and MANNARINO had a falling out...

FONTANA thought that he was not getting enough money and

complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all

he was going to get.

FONTANA then made the serious mistake

of going over KELY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN

LA ROCCA, who subsequently reported this to KELLY MANNARINO.

Since then FONTANA has been relegated to an unimportant. job

fronting the Marbet Heating Company store in New Kensington,

and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO garbling

activities.

Gun-running

Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it,

there is no guestion that SAMUEL MANNARINO was part of the

conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to

Cuba.

Originally the plans to take guns to Cuba were

plans, and the guns were scheduled to go to FIDEL CASTRO.

In

the summer of 1958, AL ROSS told

I that he could obtain

M-1 rifles and carbines.

New York City, and gave ROSS $4,000 as part payment for the

Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, that SAM MANNARINO

was interested in purchasing an Apache airplane. Because

Jis a pilot and acquainted with airplanes, he looked

over the prospective plane with Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO and

advised Dr. PESSOLANO that the airplane was too defective.

After that,

Jassisted Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a Twin

Beech airplane from a company owned by HAL DUPONT, Miami,

Florida.

When Dr. PESSOLANO told L

_that MANNARINo intended

to use the airplane to fly guns to Cuban dictator BATISTA, he

realized that these were the guns that had been promised to

him and that he was being double-crossed.

Canton, Ohio.

_later learned from a source he could not

recall

that the burglary of the armory was committed by

GEORGE FLOREA and RICHARD STEWART, with help from a "inside

man," and that the guns had been stored in the beer distribu-

torship owned by VIC CARLUCCI in Arnold, Pa.

RED GIORDANO,

who was convicted in this case merely because it was proven

he had bought some burlap bags and the weapons, when found,

had been wrapped in burlap bags, actually had nothing to do

with the case.

ANDY MANGINI,

who was never brought into the

case, actually helped load and unload the guns from CARLUCCI's

beer

distributorship to the truck and from the truck to the

airplane.

Lottery

HYMEN MARTIN, aka, PITYSBURGH HYMIE, used to have the distributor-

ship in Western Pennsylvania of the Empire Treasury lottery

tickets, and since he was friendly with the MANNARINOs, they

the Pittsburgh area.

Recently, "the outfit" has come out with the Pan American

Sweepstakes ticket, which is based on the running of the Dixie

Handicap horse race at Pimlico Track, Maryland, in the near

future.

"The outfit" compelled KELLY MANNARINO to take 10,000

intake 20,00c

books of these sweepstakes tickets, which he must dispose

of in his area of Western Pennsylvania.

One of KELLY MANNARINO's

employees, known as

"SHRIGGS," undoubtedly will handle the

delivery of the sweepstakes tickets, as he currently does with

the Empire Treasury lottery tickets.

Pittsburgh, which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are

transported from that section to New Kensington for the pur-

pose

of gambling.

Routine employees at the gambling casino

receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the

$150 weekly salary plus a small percentage of the net take.

It has been curious in the past to note that whenever they so

desire, KELLY MANNARINO or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the

gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum

of money.

For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier

to give him $1,000 and not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the

risk of being killed.

Employees at the casino do not carry

weapons generally, buton occasions, when there is a rumor that

the casino may be robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOS,

goes about town fully armed.

Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to traffic

in narcotics or to operate prostitution.

Hideouts

During the long period of time, in excess of one year, that

KELLY MANNARINO was hiding to avoid service of subpoenas,

commencing in December of 1957, he stayed at two places:

the house of "SARGE" BOTTI, In Wilmerding, Pa., and the house

MANNARINO, who i resides... In East McKeesport, Pa.
