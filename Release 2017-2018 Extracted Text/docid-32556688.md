From:

GUS ALEX

ANTI-RACKETEERING* X17

Is 3182-1098

Reurtel 10/4/65.

Your suggestion that action be initiated to have Swiss

authorities require Alex to submit affidavit relative to his

presence in Switzerland is being held in abeyance pending the

receipt of information which Legat Bern has requested from Swiss

authorities concerning this matter.

Note:

Chicago hoodlum Gus Alex and his paramour visit Switzerland

each

winter on vacation and Legat Bern has established appropriate

coverage in past years through swiss authorities.

Following last

visit of Alex during past winter Swiss authorities issued a prohibition

against Alex's re-entry into the country on the basis that he was an

undesirable.

Alex has appealed and Swiss police now advise they

verification concerning this. Legat has requested Swiss authorities

to furnish information as to

reason why they believe two different

persons by the name of Gus Alex are involved. Chicago suggests that

since evidence of Alex's presence in Switzerland is conclusive that

contact be made with Swiss officials to require Alex to furnish

affidavit denying his presence in Switzerland.

Chicago being advised that this will be held in abeyance

pending receipt of requested information by Legat Bern.
