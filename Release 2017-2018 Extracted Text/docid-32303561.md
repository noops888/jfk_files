During the small talk prior to the arrival of

KONIGSBERG, there was no indication that either JOE or RALPH

they parked the car. He could not recall the

exact location

where the car was parked but recalls that if you left the

building where HASS' office is, turned right and traveled

about two blocks, then turned right again and traveled about

fourteen blocks, that would be the approximate place the car

was parked.

Prior to their arrival in Philadelphia,

Turnpike and told him they would

and this was the first time he had ever met HASS personally

although he talked to HASS many times over the telephone in the

past concerning real estate matters.

He told HASS that KONIGSBERG

was a gangster but that Hass would have nothing to fear if he,

HASs, stuck strictly to the point and the business at hand and

did not get off on a tangent of some type with him.

HASS he did not know what KONIGSBERG wanted his services for.

states thatthis secon

man was the one who introduced ZAVOD tO KONIGSBERG fOr the loan,

which was brought out in subsequent conversation.

Around 6:00 p.m. KONIGSBERG

arrived and in his usual

overbearing way promptly began to dominate the conversation.

He showed HASS a piece of paper which apparently had to do with

the sale of a house and demanded HASS to use every trick he

knew to obtain possession of the house. KONIGSBERG refused to

accept the advice that

the document may not be legal.

To

amazement, HASS knew the owner of the property was not

the person represented in the document, but the person's mother.

At KONIGSBERG's request, HASS called the person

represented in the document on the telephone, andl

_believes

it was ZAVOD.

KONIGSBERG 6010 HASS tO FEll ZAVOD that he, HASS,

had been contacted by a lawyer in Bayonne, N.J., who had KONIGSBERG

as a client. that HAss had

some kind of paper that showed

KONIGSBERG owned his property, and HASS suggested they talk it

over. ZAVOD apparently did not want to talk about it; and since

HASS apparently knew ZAVOD, they agreed to meet later and it was

indicated that HASS lived

near Zavod and they could talk about

it some evening.

KONIGSBERG admitted to HASS that he was a shylock and

a thief; but in

order to convince HASS that he was right in

this matter,

he called ROBERTS into the office and told him

to relate the real estate

transaction which involved a Jewish

organization in

Philadelphia.

ROBERTS did as he was told; but

when ROBERTS began to tell about the arrangements

and problems

of financing, KONIOSBERG made him shut up and chased him out

of the office.:
