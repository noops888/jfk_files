PG 92-236

On February 14, 1966, PG T-6 advised:

Recently, KELLY MANNARINO called an indi-

vidual on the telephone and told this individual that

he would give him

the book"

for all types of bets,

but this person stated,

"What if I don't accept?"

MANNARINO replied,

"Think it over for one day-and

then I believe you will."

It was rumored that this

person thought it over and thereafter took the booking

action.

The unknown individual called at the time

is still not known.

LA COSA NOSTRA

It is noted that it has been reported

previously that sources have identified GABRIEL

MANNARINO as a member of La Cosa Nostra.

On March 10, 1966; PG I-T advised:

In a recent conversation with ANTHONY

also indicated that he has been in frequent con-

tact, of late, with KELLY MANNARINO and TONY RIPEPI,

Pittsburgh members of La Cosa Nostra; however, in-

formant was unable to ascertain the purpose of these

contacts.

MISCELLANEOUS

On February 18, 1966, PG T-1 advised:

Recently, SAM MANNARINO stated that while

he was incarcerated at United States Penitentiary,

Lewisburg, Pa., from mid-1964 to mid-1965, a building

contractor named (FNU) DALEY had cheated him out of

a substantial amount of money.

According to MANNARINO,

his brother, KELLY MANNARINO, and

some

friends" had

come to him, upon his release, and suggested the killing

of DALEY, but MANNARINO claimed he disuaded them from

this course of action, saying that the risk involvd

was too great for the small amount of money he had lost.
