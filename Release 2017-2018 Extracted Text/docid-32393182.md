MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: OSWALD-- Nosenko

29.7.68

1.

On 26 July

called to my attention

an aspect of NOSENKO's information which must be thoroughly

examined when we attempt to assess

analyze (sic) NOSENKO's

story about the OSWALD case..

has been reading all the

latest from NOSENKO) re OSWALD and it is his impression there

are not only gaps in the info from the stanpoint that NOSENKO

should know more but also some aspects which don't ring true.
