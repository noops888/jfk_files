SECKE

MM 492-S advised on 9/16/63 that he had no

information re captioned group other than what he read

in newspapers.

Since activities apparently centered in Miami,

it is suggested Bureau designate Miami as office of origin.

Miami

suggeses that

as this operation appears

to be in the initial stages of formation and may be a

fund raising attempt rather than a legitimate effort to

MM 639-S, until such time as

have been determined.

Copies of the attached- letterhead memo have

been disseminated locally to

• interested agencies.
