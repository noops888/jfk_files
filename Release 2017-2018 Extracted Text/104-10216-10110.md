Three ASTRUNK operations, the foremost objective of each of

which has been to re-contact AMTRUNK-10 to broaden the base

Of MHAPRON recruitment in the AlTRUNK project, have been mounted

In 1964.

Two of the three have been partially successful but

to date ANICE- 14, the ANTRUNK leader, has been unable to make

contact with AMTRUSK-10.

Oporation ASTRUNK VI was mounted in January 1961. This

was the operation in which ANTRUNK-9 and his family were ex

filtratod.

The unexpected presence of AMTRUNK-9'g wife and small

children forced AMICE-14 to vacate the infil/exfiltration area

All three attempts to launch Operation ANTRUNK VII

in February were unsuccessful largely because of rough seas and

the resultant difficulty in towing the ANTRUNK Intermediate Craft.

The firefight with the patrol craft in the first stage of the in

filtration phase on Operation AMTRUNK VIII in March forced the

team to wait out the alert which their encounter had precipitated.

• The team was able to emplace the ASLASH cache and to add to 1t

an OWL receiver with instructions and schedules for AHTRUNK-10

as well as additional S/W supplies for ANTRUNK-10 and -ll.

S/W message containing the cache recovery plan was sent to

An

AUTRUNK-10 shortly after the team's return to the JINAVE area.

With one notable exception, the above failures and

partial successes have constricted the ANTRUNK effort toward

MHAPRON recruiting at least until AYICE 14 should attempt another
