MEMORANDUM FOR:

FILE

Talking to Hank Schorr today, he passed the following

interesting detail on ISCA requests:

cos now holds for HSCh review some 1,850 documents

on individuals on whom requests were made, plus another

414 documents on organizations.

This covers about 30

individuals (there was no record in COS on a much larger

number of people). He adds that he could not tell me

how many files were involved, nor how many pages there

were per document

He states that no one from isca has come down to look

at the first document.

He states that COS is up to date on all requests

received by it, which has been reported to Sa/uDo

(now Shepanek).

I wonder if this has been reported to isca people,

and in what forme

ind what doos ESCA understand to

be its responsibility to review material when reported

realy for review?
