on August 20, 1958 that BARNEY BAKER lavished $25,000.00 on

her keeping her in plush surroundings while financing

unsuccessful appealtof her conviction. BAKER denied he

spent that much money on BROUGHER. Regarding BROUGHER'S

testimony that BARNEY BAKER spend approximately $25,000.00

on her, the Bureau's attention is directed to page 5 of

report of SA EARL C. PORTER dated February 3, 1956 at

St. Louis in GRENAP Captioned Re: ROBERT BERNARD BAKER, Wa.

BARNEY BAKER, FBI # 910 142.

The information appearing or

oage 5 states that on December 30, 1955 (former)

• SL 1071-C

advised SA ROBERT R. HANNI that ROBERT BARNEY BAKER, JOE

COSTELLO, and informant met at COSTELLO'S OffiCe On

afternoon of December 29, 1955 at which time BAKER stated

he was interested in a business venture of informant in

the State of Illinois. Informant

gave BAKER $500.00 on

account and promised BAKER $5,000.00 more if BAKER could

swing a contract for him. During the conversation BAKER

stated that he was...

"18 grand" in debt to the

"syndicate"

which money he blew on RUTH BROUGHER in Miami. BROUGHER

advised informant that BROUGHER was then serving time on a

murder charge and he, BROUGHER, had her jewelry which he

showed informant at which time

informant said he observed

a diamond brooch, some diamond earrings and finger rings.

An August 2ê, 1958 edition of the St. Louis Globe

Democrat reflects RUTH BROUGHER

testified August 21, 1958

before the Senate Committee that BARNEY BAKER hauled a

shipment of jewels to New York City while they were mixings

big-money work and play in Florida.

She rejected suggestions

by Committee Counsel ROBERT F. KENNEDY that they were

trafficing in stolen jewels to pay the rent on three costly

hideouts and to meet lawyers' bills to keep her out of

prison.

In this regard it should be noted on Page 10,

report

Of SA JOHN P. LENIHAN dated December 16, 1955 at Miami in

GRENAP captioned Re: ROBERT BERNARD BAKER, reflects that
