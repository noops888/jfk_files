08 5/7/63,

POL, adVISEd SA CARLION

GIOVANNETTI that he had been to 1915 Biltnore Street, N.w.,

on the night of Saturday,

5/4/63, and that there was

& fairly

large dice game held that night.

PCI said

I that the dice

was held in a large room on the second floor and that the

LOLLOTINg

particinated:

TOURINE; MITCHELA;

ELMONSION, JIMMY LUBIN and

others

whon he could not identify.

On 5/6/63,

Doyuty Chief ROY E, BLICK, Metropolitan

Police Department UPD, SAVISed SA ROBINT L. SHACHELDORD

that ho had received information that there was a gambling

operation located at 1915 Biltonore Street, N.H. According

to Chief BLICK he sent to Morals Division

personnel (not

anod) to the eatablishent Saturday evening, 5/4/63, 'at

approxinately 10:45 p.k.

Chief BLICK advised that the

establishment was a

large three story structure and that the

interior was laviahly furnished.

According to Chief SLICK

there uns no gaubling activity during the period that the

MPD regresentativos were there and he advised that JOSEPH

GORDON and "BILLy" MITCHIll were the only ones present.

In connection with information furnished by Chief

BICK It in Likely that the MpD officers wore aù 1915 Biltmore

Street prior to the time PCI

participated in the dice

gage the sano night.

In view of the above develoyments it appears

the dice gone at Ripley, Maryland, hns boen abandoned for

the present.

Inasnuch as the operation at 1915 Biltwore

Street involves

substantially the same individuals as fore

involved ln the lipley, Maryland, operation, it 18 likely

that the site for the game has been noved.

Accordingly it

Is raconmended that the office of origin be changed fron

Baltinore to WO since it appeara that the operation

moved fros Ripley, Maryland, to the District of Columbia.

Extra copies are provided for the Bureau for notification to

inItimore and WO of the change.

Information copies of instant comunication are

being directed to all officen who have an interest in the

subjects involved.
