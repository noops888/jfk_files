indicatos various possibilities: 1) that Cogswell and

Harricon are consumately stupid in furnishing any "packaged

that JULIAN and VIXAMA are dealing

with other U. S. investment interests unknown to DAVIDSON;

3)

tha" a senarate pool of money outside of the sum requested

ot DAVIDSON pO

bly exists toward the total of two and one-

half millions

DAVIDSON stated that with the few words VIXAMA did

get in, he gives the impression that

his activity is
