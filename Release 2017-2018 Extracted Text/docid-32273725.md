Honorable James A. Wilderotter

Associate Counsel to the President

The White House

Washington, DC 20500

Dear Mr. Wilderotter:

On Friday, Auguet 15, ve received from the Kennedy Library by

courier service the documente which David Aaron had requested

In behalf of the Church Committee In his letter dated July 29,

1975.

which had previously been examined by staff members of the

July.

You advised this office that, since the subject matter of these.

documents is unrelated to the

subject for which a written agree-

ment exists between the White House and the Church Committee,

It would be necessary for the documents to be revlewed by the

staff of the National Security Council before being conveyed

for committee use.

Accordingly, we are transuitting the docu-

ments by hand for that review.

When you have finished your

review, please return these coples to this office with your

instructions.

The last two documents listed on David Aaron's request were

not copied and forwarded by the Kennedy Library.

They will

be sent down later this week and forwarded to your office.

Sincerely,

DANIEL J. REED

Assistant Archivist for

Presidential Libraries

Dear Dr. Rhoads:

In accordance with Fritz Schwarz's letter to you of July 14, 1975

and subsequent discussions between the Select Committee staff, members

of your staff, and Mr. Wilderotter, Select Cormittee staff members have

reviewed materials at the Kennedy and Eisenhower Libraries relating to

Laos and to paramilitary activity in general.

It may be necessary to

review some addition of those materials again, but for the moment my

purpose in writing to you is to ask if some of the materials already re-

viewed could be made available to the Committee for our use here in the

Senate. A list of those documents we request for that purpose is attached,

as is a letter to Mr. James Wilderotter on this subject.

All of our staffers who have utilized the facilities at Waltham over

the past several weeks have told me that they have been extremely grati-

fied by the helpful and cooperative attitude of the Kennedy Library per-

sonnel. We are most appreciative of that assistance and also of the

crucial support which your office has provided.

Sincerely yours,

David Aaron

The Honorable James A. Wilderotter

Dear Mr. Wilderotter:

Following correspondence and conversations between the Committee

and the Administration earlier this month, Committee staff members re-

viewed various materials at the Kennedy and Eisenhower Libraries concerned

with Laos or paramilitary operations in general. As per our agreement,

notes were taken but no copies of any documents were made.

In order to facilitate the work of the Committee, we are asking the

Archivist to make a number of those documents available for our use here

at the committee. Our letter to Dr. Khoads, together with the attached

list of requested documents, is enclosed.

your assistance in facilitating the provision of those documents to the

Committee.

In closing, let me add a note of thanks for your willing cooperation

in giving Committee staff access to materials on these areas, as well as

the assassination issue.

Assistance in that spirit helps immeasuraoly

in reaching informed and considered judgments as quickly as possible,

which I think we can all agree is in the national interest.

With best regards.

Sincerely,

David Aaron
