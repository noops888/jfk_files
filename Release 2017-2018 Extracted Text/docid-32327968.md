NY 3368-C-TE advised that a ritual is

part of the

formal induction of a sponsored Italian hoodlum into the

organized criminal element as a "button man".

Prior to this ritual, the sponsor, already in the

organized element, brings the candidate around to meet the

various caporegima in a particular "family": The purpose of

this introduction Is to determine whether any information is

known

to them that would be an impediment to acceptance of the

candidate into the family.

If no impediment is uncovered, such as having been

at one time a pimp (procurer) or ever having furnished

information to the police, the candidate is

"made" by a

caporegima, underboss or boss. Only they have the power to

make button men.

Inis informant pointed out that SWATS MUT,ICAN

(DOMINICK-CIAFFONE) cannot become a button because he.

was a pimp,

but also advised that CARL APPOLITO

Jersey was made a button despite

acted as a police informant in the past.

According

to the

#source, the fact that IPPOLITO is a money maker, ono who has the

talent for making money in the rackets or legitimately, was the

deciding factor.

It is his opinion

that IPPOLITO is not trustod

by his fellows andris. not permitted to know about matters of

absolute secrecy.
