Mr. Baker stated that he has been in contact with a Mr. MITCHELL,

WERBELL, III of Powder Springs, Georgia.

Mr. Baker says that Mr. Werbell is in the business of manufacturing

weapons and delivering them by air throughout the world. Mr. Baker

understands that Mr. Werbell does this for the Central Intelligence

Agency.

Mr. Baker says that Mr. Werbell is a supposedly reputable man.

Baker understands, from Werbell, that Baker will have to get a

CIA security clearance to fly for werbell.

No. Baker has served in the hiitary'" and now participates in

He has had some paramilitary

training.

He belongs in a

"freefall"

He has a Morse Code proficiency and a Radio

License Second Class. He has Spanish language proficiency and would

be willing to collect for us.

This man persists on pursuing me re this CIA/Werbell relationship.

I tell him I don't know a thing about it. It seems he has a smuggling

record when he was I7 and he's afraid this may keep him from getting

this Werbell "CIA" clearance.
