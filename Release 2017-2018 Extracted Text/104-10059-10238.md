SUBJECT: WIROGUE/1 Mission to Kinshasa, December 1960

On 13 March 1975 a search of available documents was

made

to determine the

reason for the comment in paragraph

2

of a 17 December. 1960 cable from Leopoldville indicating

that WIROGUF/1 had attempted to recruit a European to be a

member of.

"an execution squad." The research did not clarify

this matter to any great extent, although some assumptions

can -be made on the basis of circumstantial evidence.

WIROGUE/1 was

an ethnic Georgian recruited and trained

for the old REDSOCks program. Although born in the Soviet

Union, he moved to Western Europe when two years old. He

fought in

Toband as of 1960 was

for good behavior. He was brought to the United

states originally for use as one of two agents for project

OZCAESENTINEL. He spoke native) French and fluent Georgian,

German and English.

By 1960 the Agency was involved in a reasonably major

effort to resettle WIROGUE/1, possibly in Mexico, for.the

mission for which he had been brought to the United States

had been canceled. WIROGUE/l's file indicates that as of

30 August steps were being taken to resettle him in Mexico.

However,

on 19 September. 1960. two members of Africa Division

met with him to discuss "an operational

assignment in Africa

Division." In connection with this assignment, WIROGUE/1

was to be trained in demolitiong, sinall arms and medical

immunization.

Plans to

resettle him in Mexico were can-.

He was provided a new pseudonym and immunization

WIROGUE/1 was being prepared for deep cover assignment to

and conduct

a surveillance team; (b) intercept packages;

(c) blow up bridges; and (d) execute other assignments

requiring positive action.

*His utilization is not to be

restricted to Leopoldville. Indeed, he may be subject to

call by other African stations although it is expected for

him to be resident in Leopoldville."

In this cable WIROGUE/1

was described correctly as an inventor, photographer, archi-

tect, forger and former bank robber.

He was judged to be

ingenuous, observant, shrewd, glib and one who relished

intrigue and daring.

He was assessed as able to "learn

quickly and carry out any assignment without regard to

danger."

As he was in the United States black, the plan

was for him to depart black, documented as an

to surface in West Germany and from there to proceed on

his own to Leopoldville. In November 1960 "to prevent his

identification with the U.S. Government or BKHERALD and to

preclude any unexpected recovery of his past which would

Training records for WIROGUE/1, subsequent

to his engagement by the Africa Division, indicate training

only in SW.

WIROGUE/1 arrived in Leopoldville on 2 December 1960.

His case officer gave him the following instructions:0ộ (a)

to build cover possibly by opening al

and

(b) to try to spot persons for a surveillance

team, intel

assets, particularly in Oriental province, and para-military

assets. Almost immediately upon arrival he ran into QJWINg

who told the station that WIROGUE/1 looked like an intel-

ligence agent.

In attempting to recruit QJVING for his

"execution squad"; WIROGUE/1 exceeded his instructions to

avoid making approaches without checking with Leopoldville

station.

Leopoldville because he. had run into difficulty obtaining

a residence permit.

He was terminated in September 1961.

In a summary of his activity in August 1961, Leopoldville

Station said WIROGUE/1 knew very little about station activ

ities.

It is the writer's opinion that WIROGUE/1 was recruited

for his Congo

assignment because of his third country national

background in order to establish a support mechanism in
