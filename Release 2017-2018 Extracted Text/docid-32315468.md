Informant advised

that before 1954, the numbers business was honest and was

a profit to be made. Informant stated that since 1954,

the man who actually was running the numbers business was

TONY GIACALONE.

Informant stated that GIACALONE took over

frOm PETE CORRADO and then in order to make more of a proiit

he devised a system whereby the winning number would be

changed if it was one that would cause heavy payoffs.

Informant stated that when the number began to be

changed the profits in the numbers business skyrocketed and

everybody was making a large amount of money.

Informant

stated that in 1954 EDDIE WINGATE was a small man. He stated

WINGATE came out of the South years before this and had been

a cottonpicker with no background, and little education, but

he was a shrewd man.

When WINGATE found out that the number

was being changed he immediately paid unit heads and pickup men'

more money than anyone else with the results that he took over

more and more business. Today, he has more numbers business

than anyone else in Detroit.

Informant stated that CLARENCE WILLIAMS worked

along with WINGATE and both of them became very big and may

have the dominating position in the numbers business.

Informant

stated that EDDIE WINGATE and CLARINCE WILLIANS took over most

of the Italians! Negro numbers business.

Informant stated that last January the "dagos"

decided to pay off on the correct number with the result that

all of the Negro numbers houses are in serious financial

difficulty.
