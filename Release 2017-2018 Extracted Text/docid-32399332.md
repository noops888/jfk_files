Request for Field Iraces and Investigation

1. In connection with the issuance of a Covert Security Clearance for

a Career Agent, IDENTITY-A, being used in another area, KUSODA has requested

that full overseas traces

sible be conducted on IDENTITY-A and on his wife, IDENTITY-B, and her

family.

2. Headquarters files contain a report dated December 1944 concerning

IDENTITY-B and her sister, IDENTITY-C, who are believed to be identical with

IDENTITY-A's wife and sister-in-law, respectively. According to the report,

the above-mentioned individuals (IDENTITIFS-A and -B) were described as

Costa Rican citizens then in Panama under suspicion and members of the

Russian Ballet team of Pedro and Lidia CHUPRINE.

IDENTITY-B is known to

speak and understand German. She was formerly married to Pedro MARZAL,

reportedly a German national and formerly on both the British and U. S.

Proclaimed List. She is reliably reported to have made pro-German remarks

and is pro-German in her sympathies. It was further reported that both

IDENTITY-B and IDENTITY-C had at times attempted to secure information from

members of the PBPRIME Armed Forces.

3. The addresses are requested to comply with the aforementioned

instructions, as promptly as possible, and, at the same time, attempt to

negate or confirm the information set forth above.
