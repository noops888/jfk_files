Dear Chairman Tunheim:

My colleagues and I very much appreciate your letter

of May 14th, in which you comment positively on the working

relationship between our staff and the Review Board and

staff.

We, too, regard the relationship as positive. For

example, the

Board's willingness to discuss issues with the

Agency's representatives has been very helpful. David Marwell,

Jeremy Gunn, and Mary McAuliffe deserve a good deal of credit

for fostering constructive communications between our staffs.

Again, thank you for your thoughtful comments. You can

be assured that we will continue to take very seriously the

responsibility for releasing as many assassination records

as possible.

Sincerely,

Cha Percia
