Re:

Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-16

(Oswald Pre-Assassination Files)

Dear John:

Under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44

U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994), the Review Board has the authority to "direct a ...

Government office to ... investigate the facts surrounding, additional information [and]

records...." Section 70)(1)(C)(ii). Pursuant to this authority, the Review Board is

seeking to resolve in a complete and comprehensive manner certain questions related to

files on Lee Harvey Oswald that CIA may have held prior to the assassination of

President Kennedy. Accordingly, we request that CIA provide complete and

comprehensive answers to the questions identified below.

On May 12, 1992, Director Robert M. Gates testified to the Senate Committee on

Governmental Affairs regarding CIA's records on Oswald prior to the assassination.

Mr. Gates testified that "[p]rior to President Kennedy's assassination, ClA held only a

small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 34 documents amounting to 124

pages....." (The Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1972: Hearing Before the

Committee on Governmental Affairs, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 52 (1992) (emphasis added)

(copy enclosed). It is the Review Board's current understanding, however, that at the

time of the assassination, CIA held at least three separate files (including soft files) on

Lee Harvey Oswald: a 201 file (201-289248), an HTLINGUAL file, and an Office of

TESTIMONY OF THE HON, ROBERT M. GATES, DIRECTOR,

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

Mr. GATes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I am here

that relate to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Senator Sasser. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if the Director could

put mike just a littie it loser Think opportunity to speak on

this important matter.

Let me begin by stating that I am in complete agreement with

the purpose underlying the joint resolution, that efforts should be

made to declassify and make available to the public as quickly as

possible Government documents relating to the assassination of

51

President Kennedy. We hope that opening up and giving journal-

ists, historians and, most importantly, the public access to govern-

mental files will help to resolve questions that still linger over 28

years after the assassination. Further, I believe that maximum dis-

closure will discredit the theory that CIA had anything to do with

the murder of President Kennedy.

Even before the introduction of this joint resolution, I recognized

he need for greater public access to CIA documents of historica

mportance. Two months ago, I announced the establishment of a

new unit within CIA that will be responsible for declassifying as

many historical documents as possible, consistent with the protec-

tion of intelligence sources and methods.

This new unit, the Historical Review Group, in the Agency's

Center for the Study of Intelligence, will review for declassification

documents 30 years old or older and national intelligence estimates

on the former Soviet Union that are 10 years old or older.

In addition to the systematic review of 30-year-old documents, 1

nave directed the history start in the Center for the study of Intel

igence to assemble CIA records focusing on particular events of

historical importance, including the assassination of President

Kennedy. The Historical Review Group will then examine the doc-

uments for the purpose of declassifying the records.

Because of high interest in the JFK papers, I am not waiting fo

egislation or other agencies to start declassifving documents be

longing to CIA. The Historical Review Group, at my direction, al-

ready has begun its review of the documents related to the assassi-

ation of President Kennedy, and I am happy to report that the

irst group of these records, including all CIA documents on Le

Harvey Oswald prior to the assassination, has been declassified

with quite minimal deletions and is being transferred to the Na-

tional Archives for release to the public.

This is, I acknowledge, a small fraction of what we hold, but it is

an earnest of my commitment immediately to begin review for de

lassification of this material. Indeed, as i speak, the reviewers are

going through a substantial number of documents and I anticipate

that many of these will be released shortly.

As. we carry out our program to declassify Kennedy assassination

documents, our goal will be to release as many as possible. In fact,

I recently approved a new CIA declassification guideline for our

historical review program which specifically directs a presumption

in favor of declassification. I believe we can be very forward-lean-

ing in making these documents available to the public, and I have

instructed the Historical Review Group to take this attitude to

heart. In this spirit, the Agency today will make publicly available

these new guidelines for historical review and declassification.

To understand the magnitude of the effort involved in reviewing

these documents for declassification, it is important to place them

in some context. The CLA's collection of documents related to the

assassination of President Kennedy consists of approximately

250,000 to 300,000 pages of material. This includes 64 boxes of

copies and originals of

information provided to the Warren Com-

mission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and 17

boxes of material on Lee Harvey Oswald accumulated after Presi-

dent Kennedy's assassination.

Unfortunately, and for reasons that d do not know, what we are

dealing with is a mass of material that is not indexed, is uncatalo-

gued, and is highly disorganized, all of which makes the review

process more difficult. The material contains everything from the

most sensitive intelligence sources to the most mundane news clip-

These records include documents that CIA had in its files before

the assassination,

a large number of records that CIA received

later as routine disseminations from other agencies, as well as the

reports, correspondence, and other papers that CIA prepared in the

course of the assassination investigations. I should emphasize that

these records were assembled into the present collection as a result

of specific inquiries received from the Warren Commission or the

House Select Committee on Assassinations.

Prior to President Kennedy's assassination, CIA held only a

small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 34 documents

amounting to 124 pages, some of which originated with the FBI

Department, the Navy, and newspaper clippings. Only 1

of these documents originated within CIA. I have brought along a

copy of Oswald's file as it existed before the assassination so that

you can see firsthand how slender it was at the time. As I have

already noted, we have declassified the CIA documents in this file

with quite minimal deletions and we are providing them to the Na-

tional Archives.

The records in this file dealt with Oswald's defection to the

Soviet Union in 1959 and his activities after his return in 1962, By

contrast, it was only after the assassination that CIA accumulated

the rest of the material on Oswald,

which CIA received from other agencies after November 22, 1963.

The Committee has asked about documents in our possession

generated by other agencies. In fact, much of the material held by

CIA originated with other agencies or departments. For example,

in the 17 boxes of Oswald records, approximately 40 percent of the

documents originated with the FBI and about 20 percent originated

from the State Department or elsewhere.

Our staff is still going through the material compiled at the re-

quest of the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee

on Assassinations, which includes 63 boxes of paper records and

one box that contains 78 reels of microfilm. The microfilms, in

part, overlap material in other parts of the collection. We estimate

that within the 63 boxes of paper records, approximately 21 per-

cent originated with a variety of other U.S. Government agencies,

private organizations, and foreign and American press.

Although our documents do include many documents from other

agencies, we nonetheless have a substantial collection of CIA docu-

ments that will require considerable effort to review, and as I said

earlier; at my direction, this review for declassification is now un-

derway.

A preliminary survey of these files has provided us some indica-

tions of what they contain. Although the records cover a wide vari-

ety of topics, they principally focus on CIA activities concerning

Cuba and Castro, Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, and Os

wald's subsequent activities in Mexico City and New Orleans. They

also include a large number of name traces requested by the staff

53

of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, as well as mate-

rial relating to the Garrison investigation and Cuban exile activi-

The CIA cannot release a number of documents unilaterally be-

cause of the limits in the Privacy Act which protect the names of

American citizens against unauthorized disclosure, the sequestra-

tion of many documents by the House Select Committee on Assassi-

nations, and the fact that many of the documents belong to agen-

cies other than CIA.

lease the results of the declassification effort on the sequestered

documents.

While I expect a large amount of the material can be declassified

under our program, I assume that there will be information that

cannot be released to the public for a variety of reasons, including

privacy concerns or the exposure of intelligence sources and meth-

ods. Let me take a moment to give an example of this type of mate-

rial.

During the investigation by the House Select Committee on As-

sassinations, I understand that security and personnel files were

requested on a number of CIA employees. These files contain fit-

ness reports, or performance evaluations, medical evaluations, and

credit checks on individual CIA officers. Although irrelevant to the

question of who killed President Kennedy, these and other personal

documents ultimately ended up in the sequestered collection of doc

uments. I do not believe that the benefit to the public of disclosure

of this information outweighs the clear privacy interest of the indi-

viduals in keeping the information confidential.

Similar privacy concerns exist with documents containing derog-

atory information on particular individuals where the information

is based on gossip and rumor. Our files also contain the names of

individuals who provided us intelligence information on a promise

of confidentiality. We would not disclose their names in breach of

such a promise. Where we cannot disclose such information to the

public, the Agency will make redactions and summarize the infor-

mation in order to ensure that the maximum amount of informa-

tion is released, while still protecting the identity of an agent or

the privacy of an individual.

If legislation is not passed by the Congress and signed by the

President regarding the JFK papers, to enhance

relevant to the assassination, I would appoint a panel of distin-

guished Americans from outside of Government, perhaps including

distinguished former jurists, to examine whatever documents we

have redacted or kept classified. They would then issue an unclassi-

fied public report on their findings.

The effort required to declassify the documents relating to the

assassination of President Kennedy will be daunting. However, it is

an important program and I am committed to making it work.

Even in a time of diminishing resources within the intelligence

community, I have allocated 15 full-time positions to expand the

this background that in response to the Committee's request, I cite

our few technical reservations about the mechanism established by

the joint resolution to achieve this same result. I intend to address

only intelligence community concerns. I will defer to the Depart-

ment of Justice on any additional problems posed by the joint reso-

lution.

First, vesting in an outside body the determination as to whether

CIA materials related to the assassination can be released to the

protection of intelligence sources and methods.

second, I am concerned that the joint resolution contains no pro

vision requiring security clearances or secure document handlins

by the assassination materials review board or its staff.

formation contained in documents originated by Congress or the

Warren Commission. Under the joint resolution, documents origi-

nated by these entities can be released directly by the executive di-

rector of the assassination materials review board without any

review by the President or other Executive Branch agencies.

Fourth, the joint resolution provision for a 30-day period for

agencies or departments to appeal decisions by the executive direc-

cor to release information may not provide sufficient time for

meaningful review of what could prove to be a large volume of ma-

Fiith, and finally, Section 6 of the joint resolution, which out-

lines the grounds for postponement of public release of a document,

makes no provision for postponing release of documents that may

contain Executive privilege or deliberative process, attorney client

or attorney work product information. While such privileges could

be waived in the public interest and, in fact, are not likely to arise

with respect to factual information directly related to the JFK as-

sassination, they would be unavailable under the joint resolution in

the rare case they might be needed.

These are the technical problems that I believe can be solved and

that will, in fact, expedite the release of documents bearing on the

assassination of President Kennedy. But, again, whatever the

future course of this legislation, CIA is proceeding even now to

review for declassification the relevant documents under its con-

trol. Further, we will cooperate fully with any mechanism estab

lished by the Congress and the President to declassify all of this

material.

Mr. Chairman, let me close with a comment on why I am person-

ally committed to getting these documents out. Like all Americans

old enough to remember that terrible day in 1963, and as severa

members of the Committee have alluded to, I also remember where

I was and what I was doing.

55

I was a college student at William and Mary, and I can remem-

ber how the word spread like wild fire between classes of that hor-

rible event. I made my way to Washington that weekend and stood

at the intersection of Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues

where I waited for hours to watch the President's funeral cortege. I

I entered public service less than three years later, heeding

President Kennedy's inaugural call, a call I think many in my gen-

eration heard. He said then,

"Now, the trumpet summons us again,

not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need, not as a call to

battle, though in battle we are, but as a call to bear the burden of

a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, pa-

tient in tribulation, a struggle against the

common enemies of

man. tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself."

•Mr. Chairman, the only thing more horrifying to me than the as-

sassination itself is the insidious, perverse notion that elements of

the American Government, that my own Agency, had some part in

it. 1 am determined personally to make public or to expose to disin-

terested eyes every relevant scrap of paper in CIA's possession, in

the hope of helping to dispel this corrosive suspicion. With or with-

out legislation, I intend to proceed. I believe I owe that to his

memory.

Thank you.

public access to CIA documents of historical importance.

Two months ago,

I an-

nounced the establishment of a new unit within CIA that will be responsible for

declassifying as many historical documents as possible consistent with

the protec

This new unit, the Historical

Review

Group, in the Agency's Center for the Study of Intellizence, will review for declassi-

the Study of Intelligence to assemble CLA records focusing on particular events of

ical Review Group will then ezamine the documents for the purpose of declassifying

other agencies to start declassifying documents belonging to CLA.

as we carry out our program to declassily Kennedy assassination documents, our

goal will be to release as many as

possible. In fact, I recently approved a new CLA

declassification guideline for our Historical Review Program which specifically di-

rects a presumption in favor of declassification. I believe we can be very forward

leaning in making these documents available to the public, and I have instructed

the Historical Review Group to take this attitude to heart.

To understand the magnitude of the effort involved in reviewing these documents

for declassification, it is important to place them in some context. The ClA's collec-

tion of documents related to the assassination of President Kennedy consists of ap-

proximately 200,000300,000 pages of material. This includes 64 boxes of copies and

originals of information provided to the Warren Commission and the House Select

Committee on Assassinationa and 1% boxes of material on Lee Harvey Oswald accu-

mulated after President Kennedy's assassination. Unfortunately, and for reasons

that I do not know, what we are dealing with is a mass of material that is not in-

dexed, is uncatalogued, and is highly disorganized all of which makes the review

process more difficult. The material contains everything from the most sensitive in-

tolligence sources to the most mundane news clippings.

These records include documents that CLA had in its files before the assassina-

tion, a large number of records that CIA received later as routine disseminations

rom other agencies, as well as the reporta, correspondence, and other papers that

CA prepared in the course of the assassination investigations. I should

emphasize

that these records were assembled into the present collection as a result of specific

inquiries received from the Warren Commission or the House Select Committee on

Assassinations. I have prepared a chart that illustrates this point.

As you can see, prior to President Kennedy's assassination, CIA held only a small

le on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 33 documents (approximately 110

pages), some of which originated with the FBI, State Department, the Navy, and

newspaper clippings. Only 11 documents originated with the ClA. I have brought

along a copy of Oswald's file as it existed before the assassination so that you can

see first hand how slender it was at the time. As I have already noted, we have de

classified the CIA documents in this file with quite minimal deletions, and we are

providing them to the National Archives. The records in this file dealt with Os-

wald's defection to the Soviet Union in 1959 and his activities after his return in

1961. By contrast, it was only after the assassination that CLA accumulated the rest

of the material on Oswald some 33,000 pagesmost of which CIA received from

other agencies after November 22, 1968.

You have asked about documents in our possession generated by other agencies.

In fact, much of the material held by CLA originated with other agencies or depart

mente. For example, in the 17 boxes of Oswald records, approximately 40 percent of

the documents originated with the FBI, and about 20 percent originated from the

State Department or elsewhere, Our staff is still going through the material com-

piled at the request of the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee or

Assassinations, which includes 69 boxes of paper records and one box that contains

72 reels of microfilm. The microfilms, in part, overlap material in other parts of the

collection. We estimate that within the 63 boxes of paper records, approximately 27

percent of the documents originated with a variety of other U.S. Government agen-

cies, private organizations, and foreign and American press.

Although our holdings do include many documents from other agencies, we none-

theless have a substantial collection of CIA documents that will require considerable

effort to review, and as I said earlier, at my direction, this review for declassifica-

tion is now underway. A preliminary survey of these files bas provided us some in-

dications of what they contain. Although the records cover a wide variety of topics,

they principally focus on CLA activities concerning Cuba and Castro, Oswald's defec-

tion to the Soviet Union, and Oswald's subsequent activities in Mexico City and

New Orleans. They also include a large number of name traces requested by the

staff of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, as well as material relating

to the Garrison investigation and Cuban exile activities.

The CIA cannot release a number of documents unilaterally because of the limits

in the Privacy Act (which protects the pames of American citizens against unau-

thorized disclosure, the sequestration of many documents by the House Select Com-

mittee on Assassinations, and the fact that many of the documents belong to agen-

cies other than CIA. However, we have already taken steps to lift the sequestration,

coordinate with other agencies and to begin the process of declassification. li neces-

57

sary, l will ask the House for a resolution permitting CIA to release the results of

the declassification effort on the sequestered documents.

While I expect a large amount of the material can be declassified under our pro

gram, I assume that there still will be information that cannot be released to the

public for a variety of reasons, including privacy concerns or the exposure of intelli-

gence sources and methods. Let me take a moment to give examples of this type of

material. During the investigation by the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions, I understand that security and personnel files were requested on a number of

Agency employees. These files contain fitness reports,

(pertormance evaluations),

medical evaluations and credit checks on individual CIA officers.

Although irrele-

vant to the question of who killed President Kennedy, these and other personal doc-

uments ultimately ended up in the sequestered collection of documents. I do not be-

lieve that the benefit to the public of disclosure of this information outweighs the

clear privacy interest of the individuals in keeping the information confidential.

Similar privacy concerns exist with documents containing derogatory information

on particular individuals where the information is based on gossip and rumor. Our

files also contain the names of individuals who provided us intelligence information

on a promise of confidentiality. We would not disclose their names in breach of such

a promise. Where we cannot disclose such information to the public, the Agency will

make redactiona and summarize the information in order to ensure that the maxi-

mum amount of information is released while still protecting the identity of an

agent or the privacy of an individual.

If legislation is not passed by the Congress and signed by the President regarding

the JFK papers, to enhance public confidence and provide reassurance that CIA ha

not held back any information relevant to the assassination, ! will appoint a panel

of distinguished Americans from outside of Government to examine whatever docu-

ments we have redacted or kept classified. They would then issue an unclassified

public report on their findings.

The effort required to declassify the documents related to the assassination o!

President Kennedy will be daunting. However, it is an important program and I ar

personally committed to making it work. Even in a time of diminishing resources

within the Intelligence Community, I have allocation of 15 full-time positions to

expand the History Staff and to form the Historical Review Group that will review

the JFK documents and other documents of historical interest.

I believe these actions attest to the seriousness of our intent to get these papers

declassified and released, and to open what remains classified to outside, non-gov.

ernmental review. It is against this background that, in response to this Commit-

tee's request, I cite our technical reservations about the mechanism established by

the joint resolution to achieve this same result. I intend to address only Intelligence

Community concerns; I will defer to the Department of Justice on any additional

problems posed by the joint resolution.

First, vesting in an outside body the determination as to whether CIA materials

related to the assassination can be released to the public is inconsistent with my

statutory responsibility to protect intelligence sources and methods.

Second, I am concerned that the joint resolution contains no provision requiring

security clearances or secure document handling by the Assassination Materials

Review Board or its staff.

Third, I am concerned that the joint resolution does not provide the Agency with

the opportunity to object to the release of CIA information contained in documents

originated by Congress or the Warren Commission. Under the joint resolution, docu-

menta originated by these entities can be released directly by the Executive Director

of the Assassination Materials Review Board without any review by the President

or other Executive Branch agencies.

Fourth, the joint resolution provision for a 30-day period for agencies or depart

nents to appeal decisions by the Executive Director to release information may not

rovide sufficient time for meaningiul review of what could prove to be a large

volume of material at one time.

Fifth, and finally, section 6 of the joint resolution, which outlines the grounds for

postponement of public release of a document, makes no provision for postponing

elease of documente that may contain Executive privilege or deliberative process

ttorney-client, or attorney work product information. While such privileges could

be waived in the public interest and, in fact,

are not likely to arise with respect to

factual information directly related to the JFK assassination, they would be un-

available under the joint resolution in the rare case they might be needed.

These are the technical problems that I believe can be solved and that will, in

fact, expedite the release of documents bearing on the assassination of President

Kennedy.

TESTIMONY OF THE HON. WILLIAM S. SESSIONS, DIRECTOR,

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION; ACCOMPANIED BY

DAVID G. LEITCH, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL,

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

Mr. SEssIons. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the

Committee. I have a complete statement which I will file, and

there are some diagrams which I will also make available for the

record, and a photograph of the files themselves

Chairman GLENN. Without objection, your entire statement will

be included in the record.

Mr. SEssIoNs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to appear

before you to testify about FBI investigative records relating to the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I applaud this process

and your efforts. It is fundamental that Government exist to meet

the needs of its citizens. An examination of these issues is directly

related to satisfying the intense interest and concern of our citizens

directi

about the circumstances surrounding that tragic event some 29

years ago.

From the outset, I would like to state emphatically that I favor

maximum disclosure,

consistent with the law and the legitimate

need to protect certain small but highly sensitive categories of in-

formation. I can assure you that the FBI will work cooperatively

through the Department of Justice with both the Senate and the

House to develop a comprehensive approach to these important

issues.

As you know, the Government has conducted a number of re-

views of the assassination. The Warren Commission, the House As-

sassinations Committee, and the Church Committee all conducted

reviews that I believe can be best categorized as exhaustive. It is

my understanding that the FBI provided massive amounts of infor

mation to those entities to help ensure that they accomplished

their missions. Once again, we desire to be as helpful as we are

able.

Immediately following the shooting of President Kennedy, the

FBI began a massive investigation. An intense effort was made. Re

lated investigations were conducted and much information was ex-

changed; as Director Gates has noted, between the various agen-

cies. As is the case with all major investigations,

, thousands of

pages of documents were created to record the results of these ef

forts and to facilitate the investigations.

Many different kinds of information were recorded in the FBI

the FBI headquarters and our field offices, and vice versa, were in-

cluded, as were communications between the FBI and other agen-

cies. Forensic reports were recorded. In all, FBI files relating to the

59

assassination contained over 499,000 pages of documents,

gation or a new issue arises.

the FBI began receiving requests for information relating to the as-

sassination. By 1978, four years later, over 200,000 pages of materi-

al had been processed and made available to the public through the

FBI's public reading room. Many authors, journalists, historians,

and others have visited and revisited these materials, which

remain available today as a valuable source of historic information.

I would like to briefly describe to the Committee a breakdown of

FBl records relating in some way to the assassination. The FBl has

four core files that relate directly to the investigation of the assas

sination. Our cooperation with the Warren Commission and the in-

vestigation of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby-those are the

four core files. There are approximately 499,000 pages in these

files, 263,000 of which are duplicate pages that were cross-filed,

third agency records, and some FBI records that have not been

processed pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.

Approximately 223,000 pages, or 94 percent of the records we

have processed, have already been released to the public. In addi-

tion, the FBI has several other much smaller files as a result of

other directly related investigations, such as the investigation of

Marina Oswald, and these files comprise approximately 22,000

pages, 13,000 of which are duplicate, third agency, or unprocessed

pages. Fifty-eight percent of these pages processed pursuant to the

Freedom of Information Act have been released to the public.

Of the pages available in the FBI reading room on the main floor

at FBI headquarters, approximately 189,000 pages, or 94 percent,

are avallable in their entirety. The remaining 12,000 pages in the

reading room reflect some degree of redaction. The information

that has not been disclosed or that has been redacted to

some

degree falls within the exemptions that are enumerated in the

Freedom of Information Act and the protections of the Privacy Act.

This includes information that, one, is classified on the basis of

national security; two, would disclose the identities of individuals

who specifically requested confidentiality; three, would disclose the

identities of confidential informants or sources; four, is highly per-

sonal information about individuals; or, five, originated with other

Government agencies and those agencies specifically requested that

the information not be released based upon exemptions applicable

to those particular agencies

While I strongly favor maximum disclosure under the law, ther

are certain types of information that are particularly critical to

successful law enforcement investigations and national security; for

example, information that is properly and appropriately classified,

information that would identify confidential sources, and informa-

tion that would disclose sensitive investigative techniques or the

types of information the disclosure of

which could

negatively

impact upon our ability to fulfill our mission. Information in FBI

files that has not been disclosed publicly falls largely within these

descriptions of information.

In any case, I believe it is extremely healthy for the country to

have these issues aired and to be resolved. The public interest dic

and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee

Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in

the automated security database known as the Management Data

Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS) • These files were

originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the

above numbers circa 1964. A'hand search was also conducted

of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated .

system. This hand search produced the same results as the

automated search of MDP/PS.

(U) In your request specific mention is made of an

HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official

files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),

#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of

the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along

so grat d

with numerous soft files.

Since this material has been

destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files

contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search of

Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any of

these files.

•(U) Attached is all of the available information

regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL files. This

information was retrieved from l

Jof the

Information Management Branch/Records Control Section and

from a review of general office administrative files.

Question z: (U) Other than for the 201-289248 file

on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was

opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and

the documents that were in the file at the time of the

assassination.

Responae:

(U) As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have

been destroyed.

Since OS files are usually set up in

chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in

close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was

undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening

dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826

(U) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project

that involved opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to

and from the Soviet Union, l

and South

America. In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with

subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and

SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of

mail with the acquired information referred to the

Directorate of Operations.

(U) The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa

1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens

defecting to other countries and information regarding

foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.

This compilation of information was received from press

clippings, Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal

Bureau of. Investigation, the Department of State, and the

various armed services.

The pre-assassination documents

located in this file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

files on Oswald, please explain why those offices

maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.

In answering this question, please make appropriate

references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)

and to any other materials (including organizational

charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and

organization reasons for which CI and OS would have

maintained such files.

Response:

(U) It is believed that os holdings on Lee

Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during

which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in

contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the

Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the

Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution

• of these reports.

In the beginning this material was

probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of

documents on this person increased, a separate file was

created to be the repository of information on the alleged

American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors

File that a separate file exists on Oswald.

(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of

Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.

Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-

assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a

majority of them contain a notation or the initials of

Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the

officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing

of this information.

Destruction of MICHAOS and HTLINGUAL

Project Files

Reguest for Authorization to Retain of

Destroy Quentionable Recorda: I41C's for

MHCHAOS and HTLINGUAL Projects, from

IMS/MPG/IRMB, dated 18 December 1989

The seferenced request seeks concurrence for the

destruction of MHCHAOS and HILINGUAL files in accordance with

routine records destruction schedules approved by the National

Archivist.

Subject to the qualifications set forth below, the

proposed destruction can proceed without legal objection.

On several occasions over the past 12 years, DO/IMS has

proposed that the Agency identify and destroy MICHAOS and

HTLINGUAL racorda in accordance with routine records

destruction schedules.

The major reason not to do so has been

the existence of litigation that has necessitated retention

of

those records.

With the settlement of the National Lawyers'

Guild litigation, a major obstacle to routine records

destruction appears to

have been alininated.

3.

That case alone, however, does not govern the records

retention or destruction of MCHAOS OF HTLINGUAL fILeS.

addition, dentruction may proceed only in accordance with the

records disposition authorization provided by the Archivist on.

17 March 1978. (Job Nos. NCI-263-77-18 and NC1-263-78-1). The

approval given by the Archivist 1s subject to essentially the

following conditions: (1) files and documents that are the

objects of FOlA and Privacy Act requests, or those involved in

any other litigation, are not to be destroyed: (2) files that

document the initiation, implementation, and termination of the

projects, and other files on U.S. persons of forelgn

intelligence or counterintelligence value which the Agency 15

required to maintain, are not to be destroyed; (3) no disposal

w1l] occur prior to review and concurrance of the Senate select

Committee on Intelligence.

In reviawing the materials you have provided. I have

more to conclude that then ssc. Chairman, Birch Bayh, in

severa, reparate letters dated 6 april 1978, incormed the Do

that the Committee had no objection to the implementation os

the records disposal lists approved by the Archivist. In my

vier, therefore, condition number (3) has been satisfied.

Accordingly, with the exception of the case of Hurwitz r.

Initad States, there appear to be no ongoing court cases

relating to MICHAOS OF HTLINGUAL files that necessitate the

retention of those materials. All HIINGUAL materials relating

to L0o I. Hurwite, therefore, should be retained. In addition.

any records pertaining to DI. Sidney M. Peck (Peck y, GIA)

should be retained.

I am not aware of any other matters that

would require retention of the files at the present time, but

you should contact the Agency's FOIA Coordinator to determine

1f there are any outstanding FOIA or Privacy Act requests

relating to MICHAOS or HTLINGUAL that should not be destroyed.

If so, materials should be retained in accordance with the

roguirements of the Records Disposal List. Finally, of course,

Information that the Agency must maintain that is of foreign

Intelligence value also should not be destroyad.

1. I would also point out that the terms of the National

Lawyers Guild settlement reguire that all agencies of the

Federal Government, Including the CIA, shall not use, release

or dinclose, within or outside the Covernment, certain

information relating to the National Lawyers Guild and its

mubunits.

Accordingly, 1f there is CIA Information derived

from the FaI's Investigation relating to the National Lawyers'

Guild, Agency records, files or indices must be appropriately

marked so as to permit implementation of the settlement

agreement•

This means that, to the extent MICHAOS recoIds are

not Isolated but are contained in other Agency ties. some

means of ensuring that the information is not disseminated must

be mide.

The following actions need to be taken to complete the

Agency's response to the JFK Board's Request for Additional

Information and Records No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination

Files:

a.

Response to Request: CIA has to provide an official

response that will become a part of the public record.

The

response should be a releasable version of your memorandum of

27 February 1997; according to the classification markings, most

of the text is unclassified. I recommend that you send me an

annotated copy indicating what can be released.

I will prepare

the response and coordinate it with you. Also please review the

attachments to the memorandum for possible release. The JEK

Board may consider documentation of the destruction of

potentially relevant files as assassination records.

HRG will

handle any additional coordination (OGC, DO, etc.) required.

b. Iransfer of Oswald's OS File(#0351164): The original

Office of Security subject file on Oswald currently held by the

Office of Personnel Security should be transferred to the

Historical Review Group.

The file will be incorporated into the

Agency's JFK Assassination Collection and reviewed for release

under the JFK Act of 1992. Most documents in this file will

probably be duplicates of

documents in the HSCA sequestered

mates are considered assassenation records The ARRe"statt

assassination records.

The ARRB staff has

asked for access to the file when practical.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Chief, Information Management Branch

Office of Personnel Security

OSWALD, LEE HARVES

AIN: 0351164

The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31

January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center for the Study

of Intelligence (HRG/CSI), via the Directorate of

Administration/Information Review Office, with researching pre-

assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was.

generated by the John F. Kennedy. Board's desire to review and

declassify relevant material. The results of this réview were

forwarded to the ING/CSI on 21 February 1997.

2.

During the Informa:ion Management Branch's

(IMB) research in response to the above tasking it was noted that

Volume V of the Oswald files las not on the shelf where Volumes

I-IV and VI-VII were located. A search of the entire area where

the volumes had been

maintained failed to locate Volume V. The

IMB Files Section was subsequently charged with conducting an

all out search for the missing volume. The search failed to find

Volume V.

In July 1997, the Oswald files were reviewed page by

page prior to being turned over to. HRG/CSI and another attempt

was made to locate Volume V or to locate persons who might know

what happened to it. Volume V wis not located nor were any

persons located who were knowledgeable of its status.

4.

During the complete review of the Oswald files no

time gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall

ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume V

nad been consolidated into other volumes or that Volume V never

kisted, but that a numbering error resulted in what should hav

een Volume V being labeled as Volume VI. The use of Romar

numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this

error to occur.

Dear Dr. Gunn:

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records •

No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files) and

nation and Reso des

No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)

This is a partial response to the ARRB's referent

request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had

on Lee Harvey Oswald.

It is believed the following comments

and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of

Security questions. The DO response is pending.

• 1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum

containing information from the Agency's Office of Personnel

• Security which provides details about the files it had on

Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they

were created.

These include the Office of Security file on

Oswald, a general file on Americans who had defected to

another country and information about HTLINGUAL files:

2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977

memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which

explains the numbering of that Office's file on Oswald. In

particular, it explains why the "missing" volume V may never

have existed.

3. An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald

Security file and the file on American defectors.

4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and

those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRE

staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will

be processed according to current release guidelines.

If you have any questions about this response, please

advise.

sincerely..

22 December 1997

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. Pursuant to ARRB

"Resquet No. CIA-16, the Office of

Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre-

assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The following

responses are provided to those questions

which pertain to

he Office of Personnel Security (OPS).

These responses are

P octobe 12. was on a tie of 0 01a

the best reasonable answers based on available information.

Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to

Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as

possible,

each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time

of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response:

At the time of the assassination, the Office

of Security (OS) held two files which contained information

on Lee Harvey Oswald.

One file entitled "Defectors File"

(#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and :

the second file was Office of Security subject file on Lee

Harvey Oswald

(#0351164). This information was reflected in

the automated security database known as the Management Data

Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were

originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the

above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted

of microfiche

records which were superseded by the automated

system.

This hand search produced the same results as the

automated search of MDP/PS.

2. Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an

HTLINGUAL file.

MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official

files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),

#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of

the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along

with numerous

soft files.

Since this material has been

destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files

contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search

of Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any

of these files.

Attached is all of the available

information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL

files.

This information was retrieved from the Information

Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review

of general office administrative files.

Question 2: For other than the 201-289248 file on

Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the

purpose for the opening of the file, and the documents that

were in the file at the time of the

assassination.

Response: As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been

destroyed.

Since OS files are usually set up in

chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in

close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was

undertaken.

This search revealed the approximate opening

dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826

#0090079

#0093466

#0119144

Opened approximately July 1952

Opened approximately February 1953

Opened approximately July 1953

Opened approximately May 1955

3. HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project

involving the opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to

and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South

America.

In the Office of Security this project was known

as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER,

INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER.

The Office of Security actually

conducted the opening and monitoring of mail with the

acquired information being referred to the Directorate of

Operations.

4. The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa

1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens

defecting to other countries and information regarding

foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.

This file contained information was from press clippings,

Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed

services.

The pre-assassination documents located in this

file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959

entitled "U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at

15"

b. Department of State memorandum dated 25 October

1960 with attached list of American "defectors"

The index reference to the Defectors File

identifies a

list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as

the Defector Machine Listing.

This listing was a computer

printout of defectors and provided limited biographic data

on each name.

This listing was maintained separately from

the actual Defectors File; notations within the Defectors

File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently

charged to the Security Analysis Group of the Office of

Security. Efforts to locate this listing or determine its

disposition have been unsuccessful.

6. Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors

File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.

An employee of this Office was, recalls the Defector Machine

Listing as being approximately one and one-half inches thick

and in two parts.

One part consisted of an alphabetical

index of defector names with assigned numbers. The second

part listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and

contained the limited biographic däta on each name.

7.

The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald

(#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file

was created as a separate repository for the numerous press

clippings and reports received from other government

agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR

and his activities following his return to the United

States.

The first volume of this file appears to have been

preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents

contained in this file are as follows:

a. Department of State telegram #1304 from Moscow

dated 31 October 1959

b. The Washington Post press clipping dated

1 November 1959 entitled "Ex-Marine Asks Soviet

Question 4: To the extent that Counterintelligence

and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination

files on Oswald, please explain why those offices

maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.

In answering this question, please make appropriate

references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)

and to any other materials (including organizational

charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and

organization reasons for which CI and OS would have

maintained such files.

Response: It is believed that os holdings on tee

Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during

which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in

contact with

the American Embassy in Moscow, and the

Department of State prepared reports

on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the

Central Intelligence Agency was

included in the distribution

of these reports.

In the beginning this material was

probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of

5

## Page 49

13-00000

documents increased, a separate file was created to be the

repository of information on the alleged American defector.

There is a notation in the Defectors File that a separate

file exists on Oswald.

9. Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of

Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.

Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-

assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a

majority of them contain a notation or the initials of

Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the

officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing

of this information.

10.

The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the

component responsible for collecting, developing, and

evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to

detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency's

organization, employees, and activities by foreign or

domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted

research in connection with employee loyalty cases and

maintained records identifying personalities, environments.

and personal traits of individuals who had been of

counterintelligence interest over the years.

SRS maintained

liaison

with various government agencies in connection with

counterintelligence activities and coordinated the

counterintelligence effort throughout OS.

Using

organizational charts of this time period, sRs reported

directly to the office of the Director of Security.

11. A representataive of

the Office of Personnel

Security /Management Staff was queried regarding the mission

and

functions of SRS during the pre-assassination time

period. He made inquiries relating to the above request,

and the OPS/ Information Management Officer retrieved retired

policy records for review.

The information on the mission

and function of SRS was retrieved from the archived Office

of Security administrative and historical files as well as a

review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens.

DO Response to Board Request CIA - 16

Oswald Pre-Assassination Files

The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO

records to determine if there were any additional files

containing pre-assassination records relating to

Oswald.

Research identified a document in the Oswald

201 which appeared to be a file inventory.

The

document identified CI Staff as the file custodian.

CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were

incorporated into the 201.

Prior tô establishing a 201, any documents received

would have been placed in an operational interest file.

We found no reference to the existence of an

operational file.

If such

a file had existed, however.

it might not have been registered in the central index.

It was standard procedures that upon opening a 201, the

documents from an interest file would be transferred to

the 201.

Given that Oswald was a subject of the HTLINGUAL

operation, it is reasonable to believe that there was a

file on him. We destroyed all of the HTLINGUAL files

under court order, and no record was made of what files

existed. We did not review all of the DO record system

to destroy all copies of material which may have been

derived from HTLINGUAL material. We know, for

instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items related to

Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection

In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the

information we are aware of that we had prior to the

assassination.
