DATE:

SAC, NEWARK (105-11467) (RUC)

SUBJECT:

ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO, Aka

IS - CUBA

(00: Miami)

Re Newark letter to Bureau, 6/29/62.

Contacts with Cuban informants and sources

uring July and August, 1962 have produced no informatior

concerning collections

being made in New Jersey by Seconc

National Front of Escambrey or representatives.

On 8/27/62, PSI DIONISEO FELINO RODRIGUEZ,

Union City, New Jersey, advised that he could not further

identify SILBERIO (PH) -RODRIGUEZ who reportedly had made

attempts to collect money supposedly for subject's group

about March, 1962.

PSI indicated that this individual

was possibly from New York and, instead of an organized

collection attempt, could have been

someone who was attempting

to obtain personal financial benefit.

As previously reported,

INS file, credit and criminal checks have produced no

information concerning this person whose name might be ir

in error.

Newark, therefore, is making no further attempts

to identify RODRIGUEZ.

Newark will remain alert for organized collections

being made in New Jersey by GUTIERREZ'S group and will report

same to Miami as office of origin.
