and desired charges be dropped against HITSON so he could be

returned to Florida to be of assistance to law enforcement

authorities. HITSON advised he had known Sgt. HENNING for

some 15 to 18 years and

he was one of the few honest police officers

in the SO, Tampa, Florida. HITSON stated that he desired

to return

to Florida to work back into the organization, where-

by being able to furnish information of value.

He said he

realized he was risking his life.

HITSON advised there were

many dishonest officers but he did not know their identities.

He stated he is able to make this statement because he knows

from experience that most of the time when a raid is planned

on any gambling club in the Tampa area, the

owners usually

receive a telephone

call prior to the arrival of the officers

in sufficient time to give them a chance to get rid of any

gambling evidence.

HITSON advised he would be glad to be of assistance

to the FBI upon his return to Florida but did not desire

sgt.

HENNING to know of his cooperation with the FBI at the same

time.

He said that if he is successful in returning to Florida

he would be in telephonic contact with the FBI Office and make

arrangements to furnish information on a confidential basis.

To date, 5/20/64, no further information has been

heard from HITSON

in the Tampa Division.
