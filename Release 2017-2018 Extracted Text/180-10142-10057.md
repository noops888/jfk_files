An earlier CIA dispatch from the CIA Chief of

Station in Mexico City to the Chief of the CIA's Western

Hemisphere Division records that:

Wilfredo of the Cuban Consulate, Tampico,

reported that Luisa Calderon has a sister

residing in Reynosa, Texas... Luisa may go

up to the border to visit her sister soon--

or her mother may make the trip--details

not clear.

21849, July 31, 19651

At the very least, the above dispatched evidenced

an interest in Calderon's activities and those of her

family. Whether this interest took the form of a clan-

destine-agent relationship is

not revealed by Calderon's

201 file.

The Committee has queried the author of the above-

cited dispatch requesting that Calderon's sister be con-

tacted by the CIA's "domestic exploitation section."

David Ronis, the dispatch's author, was a member

of the CIA's Special Affairs staff at the time he wrote

the dispatch. He worked principally at CIA headquarters

and was when responsible for-recruitment and handling

of

of agents for collection/intelligence data. Mr. Ronis,

when

interviewed by this Committee, stated that part of

his responsibility was to scour the Western Hemisphere

division for operational leads related to the work of

It was Ronis' recollection

that the above-cited domestic exploitation section was

a task force within the Special Affairs Staff.

He also

stated that in 1963 the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division

might have been requested to locate Luisa Calderon's sis-

ter. Ronis told the Committee that he had no recollection

of recruiting any person associated with the Cuban Intel-

ligence Service. He did recall that he had recruited

women to perform tasks for the Agency. However, he did

not recall ever recruiting any employees of the Cuban

Embassy/Consulate in Mexico City. Finally, Mr. Ronis

stated that he had no recollection that Luisa Calderon

was associated with the CIA. (HSCA Staff Interview August

31, 1978)

Various present and former CIA representatives

were queried whether Luisa Calderon had ever been asso-

ciated with the CIA. The uniform. answer was that no one

recalled such an association. (Cites: Helms, Hearing, August

THE AMLASH OPERATION

During 1967, the CIA's Inspector General issued a

report which examined CIA supported assassination plots.

Included in this report was discussion of the CIA-Mafia

plots and an Agency project referred to as the AMLASH

operation (67 IGR PP: 1-74, 78-112). The AMLASH operation

involved a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA

cryptonym AMIASH/I) who during 1962 while meeting with a

CIA representative, expressed the desire to assassinate

Fidel Castro (1967 IGR p.84). As a result of AMLASH's

expressed objective and the CIA's desire to find a viable

political alternative to the Castro regime, the Agency sub-

sequently provided AMLASH with both moral and material

support designed to eliminate Fidel Castro. (1967 IGR

Lat

you

pp. 80-94). The AMLASH operation was terminated by the

CIA in 1965 as the result of security leaks (1967 IGR

meun

pp: 104-106). During 1965, AMLASH and his conspirators

these

?were brought to trial in Cuba for plotting against Castro.

tam

AMIASH was sentenced to death, but at Castro's request the

sentence was reduced to twenty-five years imprisonment.

(1967 IGR pp. 107-110) •

In its examination of the AMLASH operation

the 1967

IGR concluded that the CIA had offered both direct and in-

direct support for AMLASH's plotting (1967 IGR p. 80).

The most striking example of the CIA's direct offer of sup-

port to AMLASH reported by the 1967 IGR states:

The 1967 IGR offered no firm evidence confirming

or refuting Castro's knowledge of the MALASH operation prior

to the assassination of President Kennedy. The Report

does note that, in 1965, when AMLASH was tried in Havana

explint.

(1967 IGR p. 111)

The Church Committee in Book V of its Final Report

examined the AMLASH operation in great detail. (SSC,

Book V, pp.2-7, 67-69) The Church Committee concluded:

The AMLASH plot was more relevant to the Warren

Commission work thaky the early CIA assassination

plots with the underworld. Unlike those earlier

plots, the AMLASH operation was in progress at

the time of the assassination; unlike the earlier

plots, the AMLASH operation could clearly be traced

to the CIA; and unlike the earlier plots, the CIA

had endorsed AMLASH's proposal for a coup, the

first step to him being Castro's assassination,

despite Castro's threat to retaliate for such

plotting. No one directly involved in either

investigation (i.e. the CIA and the FBI) was told

of the AMLASH operation. No one investigated a

connection between the AMLASH operation and

President Kennedy's assassination.

Although

Oswald had been in contact with pro-Castro

and anti-Castro groups for many months before

the assassination, the CIA did not conduct

a thorough investigation of questions of

Cuban government or Cuban exile involvement in

the assassination. (Church Committee, Book V,

Final Report, p. 5)

In 1977, the CIA issueded a second Inspector

General's Report concerning the subject of CIA sponsored

assassination plots.. This Report, in large part ,was in-

tended as a rebuttal of the Church Committee's findings.

The 1977 IGR states:

The Report (of the Church Committee) assigns

it (the AMLASH operation) characteristics that

it did not have during the period preceding

the assassination of JFK in order to support

the SSC view that it should have been reported

to the Warren Commission. (1977 IGR p. 2)

The 1977 IGR concluded that, prior to the assassination

of President Kennedy, the AMLASH operation was not an

assassination plot and that the treatment of the issue

by the Church Committee was both imprecise and misleading. Starte

it would have served to reinforce the credi

had it taken a broader view of the matter (of

normal avenue of investigation).

The CIA,

too, could have considered in specific terms

what most then saw in general terms--the possi-

bility of Soviet or Cuban involvement in the

assassination because of the tensions of the

That CIA employees at the time felt--

as they obviously did--that the activities

about which they knew had no relevance to

the Warren Commission inquiry does not take

the place of a record of conscious

review.

(1977IGR p. 11)

It should be noted that Richard Helms, as the highest

level CIA employee in contact with the Warren Commission

Ola regular basis, testified to the Rockefeller Commission

that he did not believe the AMASH operation taareen

relevant to the investigation of President Kennedy's death.

(Rockefeller Commission, Testimony of

Richard Helms, 4/24/75

pp. 389-391, 2) In addition, Mr. Helms testified before

thescoansttee that the alash operation was not designed

to be an assassination plot (Richard Helms, Executive Ses-

sion testimony, 8/9/78 pp. 26-27).

A contrasting view to the testimony of Mr. Helms was

offered by Joseph Langosch who in 1963 was the Chief of

Counterintelligence for the CIA's Special Affairs Staff

(hereinafter SAS). During 1963, the Special Affairs Staff

was the CIA component responsible for CIA operations di-

rected against the Government of Cuba and the Cuban Intel-

ligence Services (HSCA Affidavit of Langosch,

Sept. 14,

ate

this,

## Page 17

- 5 -

1978, p.l) The Special Affairs Staff was headed by

Desmond Fitzgerald and was responsible for the AMLASH

operation (Church Report, Book V, pp. 3, 8, 79) $ Langosch

as the Chief of Counterintelligence for the Special Af-

fairs Staff was

responsible for safeguarding SAS against

penetration by foreign intelligence services, particularly

the Cuban Intelligence Services. (HSCA staff,

supra)

It was Langosch's recollection

a. san.

that the AMLASH operation prior to the

assassination of President Kennedy was

characterized by the Special Affairs

staff, Desmond Fitzgerald and other

senior CIA officers as an assassination

operation initiated and sponsored by the

CIA.

Langosch further recollected that as of 1962 it

was highly possible that the Cuban Intelligence Services

were aware of AMLASH and his association with the CIA and

that the information upon which Langosch based his conclu-

sion that the AMLASH operation was insecure was available

to senior level CIA officials including Desmond Fitzgerald.

(HSCA Langosch Affidavit p. 4 supra)

However; the issue before this Committee is not

simply whether the AMLASH operation was an assassination

plot prior to President Kennedy's death. The broader

and

more significant issue, as the 1977IGR has identified

it, is whether the AMLASH operation was of sufficient

relevancy to have been reported to the Warren Commission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation the determina-

tion is a most difficult matter to resolve.

Reasonable

men may differ in their characterization of the Agency's

operational objecitves.

Based upon the presently available evidence it

is the Committee's position that such information, if made

available to the Warren Commission

mor have stimulated

the Commission's investigative concern for possible Cuban

involvement or complicity in the assassination. As J.

Lee Rankin commented before this Committee:

...when I read...the Church Committee's

report--it was an ideal situation for them

to just pick out any way they wanted to

tell the story and fit it in with the

facts that had to be met and then either

It might have only revealed

On April 23, 1276 the Senate Select Conmittee to Revie

Study Governmental Operations (hereinafter SS) issued its it wi

report regarding "The Investigation of the Assassination me?

of President John F. Kennedy: Performance of the Intelli-

gence Agencies." This report set forth a limited study

of those federal agencies, primarily the Federal Bureau

of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, that

provided assistance to the Warren Commission in its investi-

gation of the circumstances surrounding the assassination

of President Kennedy. In particular, the SSC examined

the relevancy of certain information pertaining to alleged

assassination plots by the CIA against Fidel Castro and

the withholding of this information from the Warren Commis-

sion. The SSC conclusions pertaining to these alleged CIA

sponsored assassination plots

have generated additional

public and private inquiries regarding the substance and

quality of information reported by the CIA to the Warren

Commission.

During 1977, the CIA issued a report prepared by

the Agency's Inspector General (hereinafter 77IGR). This

report was intended to be, in large part, a rebuttal to

the findings of the SSC pertaining to alleged CIA sponsored

assassination plots. The 77hGR response concluded:

1) That the SSC Book V final report "contains nu-

factual errors, both in the extensive

treatment of a selected operation (AMLASH) and

in a number of separate incidents that it pre-

sents" ;

2) "While one can make the point in principle that

of the U.S. Government, in trying to make the

case for that concept, Book V of the Senate Se-

lect Committee Final Report went to such lengths

in its treatment as to detract from the point

at hand. It is difficult to characterize it

more generously.* (CIA 77IGR, p. 9)

The 77IGR further concluded that the SSC Final Report

conveyed an impression of limited effort by the CIA to as-

six the warren commission in its work. the TIeR was in

fundamental disagreement with this characterization of the

SSC findings and noted that "CIA did seek and collect in-

formation in support of the Warren Commission. Additionally,

it conducted studies and submitted special analyses and

reports." (Introduction to Tab E of 1TIGR).

* The 77 IGR comments regarding Warren Commission lack of

knowledge of anti-Cuban programs of the U.S. government

will be addressed at lord! in another section of this report.

In order

to further demonstrate the scope of support

provided by the CIA to the Warren Commission, the 77IGR com-

piled a comprehensive listing of CIA generated material

provided to both the U.S. Intelligence Community and the

Warren Commission regarding the assassination of President

Kennedy. In this

respect the committee agrees with the

77 IGR wherein it is stated that

"This compilation (of CIA generated material)

is appropriate to consideration of the extent

of the CIA effort, to the extent that it reveals

something of the results of that effort."•

(77 IGR, Introduction to Tab E)

Therefore, in order to examine the broad issue of

the CIA's scope and quality of support to the Warren Com-

mission in both an objective and disciplin manner, the

Committee has reviewed in detail the 77 IGR's listing of

information

pertaining to the assassination provided the

Warren Commission and the U.S. Intelligence Community

The

Committee has particularly focused its attention on the

specific issue of whether the CIA or any employee or former

employee of the CIA misinformed, or withheld information

relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy from

the Warren Commission. In addition, the Committee has

attempted to determine whether, if the Warren Commission

was misinformed or not made privy to information relevant

to its investigation, whether the misinforming or withhold-

ing of evidence from the Warren Commission was the result

of a conscious intent to do so by the Agency or its employes

In examining the Agency's comprehensive listing of

CIA generated material referenced above, the Committee has

paralled its review to the structure given to these materials

by the 77 IGR. In this regard, the 77 IGR details four

interrelated compilations of Kennedy assassination material.:

These four compilations are:

1) Agency dissemination of information to the Intel-

ligence Community (Formal and Informal Dissemina-

tions,)

2) Dissemination of material to the Warren Commission

Agency dissemination to the FBI et al regarding

rumors and

allegations regarding President Kennedy's

assassination

J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel for the Warren Com-

mission, testified that the Warren Commission and its

staff were assured that the Agency would cooperate in its

work. (HSCA deposition of J. Lee Rankin, August 17, 1978,

Classified, p. 4).

John McCone, Director of Central Intelligence at

the time of President Kennedy's assassination and during

the Warren Commission investigation, supported Mr. Rankin's

testimony in this regard by characterizing the CIA's work

vis a vis the Warren Commission as both responsive and

comprehensive. (HSCA deposition of John McCone, August 17,

1978, p. 5) Mr. McCone testified that he was personally

responsible for determining whether Lee Harvey Oswald was

ever associated with the Agency. Mr. McCone was

further

responsible for ensuring that all relevant matters

(McCone

building where our information is microfilmed

Mr. Raymond Rocca, one of the CIA's key represen-

tatives to the Warren Commission during its investigation,

also characterized the Agency's role as one of full sup-

port to the Warren Commssion. Mr. Rocca, who served as

the Chief of the Research and Analysis Division for the

Counter-Intelligence Staff of the CIA recalled under oath

that Richard Helms had direeted thatgiven the following diractive:

All material bearing in any way that could be

of assistance to the Warren Commission should

be seen by CI staff and Rand A and marked

for Us.

He issued very, very strictly worded

indications--they were verbal in so far as I

know--that we were to leave no stone unturned.

1978, p. 24)

slimes.

A somehwat different view of the CIA's role regard-

ing the supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commis-

sion was propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who

served as the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the

Warren Commission investigation and who was directly re

sponsible for the CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's

assassination (Rocca dep. p.23), testified to the Committee

that the CIA made every effort to be as responsive as pos-

sible to Warren Commission requests. (HSCA Executive Session

testimony of Richard Helms, August 9, 1978, p.10)

Mr.

Helms added further testimony regarding the manner in

which the CIA provided its information to the Warren Com-

mission. . He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-

mission).

We would attempt to respond to it.

But these inquiries came in individual bits and

pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we

could. (Helms hearing p. 10-11)

It was Mr. Helms' recollection that the CIA pro-

vided information to the warren Commission on the basis

of the Commission's specific requests. under matt ne

supported this proposition:

Mr. Goldsmith: In summary, is it your position

• that

the Agency gave the Warren Commission

information only in response to speci-

fic requests by the Warren Commission?

Mr. Helms:

That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that

memory is fallable.

There may have been

times or circumstances under which some

thing different might have occured, but

my recollection is that we were attempting

to be responsive and supportive to the

FBI and the Warren Commission.

When

they asked for something we gave it to

them.

As far as our volunteering informa-

tion is concerned, I have no recollection

of whether we volunteered it or not.

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

Commission requests on a case by case basis rather than

uniformly volunteering relevant information to the Warren

Commission stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's

The following exchange between Committee Gounsel

and Mr. Helms illustrates the acuterlaxitye the Agency's

compromise:

Mr. Goldsmith:

Mr. Haems, I take it from your testi-

mony that your position is that the

anti-Castro plots, in fact, were rele-

vant to the Warren Commission's work;

and, in light of that, the Committee

would like to be informed as to why

the Warren Commission was not told by

you of the anti-Castro assassination

plots.

Mr. Helms:

I have never been asked to testify before

the Warren Commission about our operations.

Mr. Goldsmith: If the Warren Commission did not know

of the operation, it certainly was not

in a position to ask you about it.

Is that not true?

Mr. Helms:.

Yes, but how do you know they did not know

about it?

How do you know Mr. Dulles had

not told them? How was I to know that?

And besides, I was not the Director of

the Agency and in the CIA, you did not

go

traipsing around to the Warren Commission

or to Congressional Committees to to any-

place else without the Director's permis-

sion.

Mr. Goldsmith: Did you ever discuss with the Director whe-

ther the Warren Commission should be in-

formed of the anti-Castro assassination

plots?

Mr. Helms:

I did not, as

far as I recall.

Mr. McCone testified that he first

became aware of the CIA's anti-Castro assassination plots

involving CIA-Mafia ties during August 1963. He stated

that upon learning of these plots, he directed that the

Agency cease

all such

activities. (McCone deposition, p.13)

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

On February 1, 1964, Helms appeared before the

Commission (see above) and likely discussed the memoran-

dum of January 31, 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee

Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of

January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

alast as of his wasting

the Warren Commission

had no substantive knowledge

or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-

cripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-

ruary 10, 1964 letter whether Oswald's direct communica-

tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in

of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated

by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-

mission had been informed o

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this

conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between .

the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-

mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headguar-

ters in Langley; Virginia and had been shown various trans-

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions concerner owald's

Mexico trip,

that he had reached

were derived from CIA

memorandal of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

and in addition a Mexican federal police summary Binof

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, (sich an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that Salwson placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that Salwson had been provided the Duran

franscripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments conerning the Mailcan police report,

it would appear that the Warren Commission as. of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

Insert pa8

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported

by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)

wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

wente wes

is based upon an analysis of Sylvia Duran's testi-

• mony before the Mexican police.

for this purpose. His analysis bould have reflected

criticism of the Mexican police summary report.

On March 12, 1964, representatives of the Warren

Commission and the CIA confered regarding the February 12

request for the materials forwarded to the Secret Service by

the Agency. (See Rankin letter of March 16, 1964 and Slawson

The record indicates that

the Commission at the March 12

meeting pressed for access to the Secret Service materials.

Rankin wrote to Helms on March 16 that it was his understanding

that the CIA would supply the Commission with a paraphrase of

each report or communication pertaining to the Secret Service

materials "with all indications of your confidential communica-

tions techniques and confidential sources deleted. You will

also afford members of our staff working in this area an

opportunity to review the actual file so that they may give

Oswald in Mexico City. Furthermore, the CIA stated that it

had determined that the photograph shown to Marguerite

Oswald on November 22, 1963 did not refer to lee Harvey Oswald, Th's

was done by checking the photograph against the press photographs of

Oswald generally available on November 23, 1963.

CD 674 reveals that on November 22, 1963, immediately

following the assassination, and on November 23, 1963, three

cabled reports were received at CIA headquarters from the CIA

Mexico City Station regarding photographs of an unidentified man

who had visited the Cuban and Soviet Embassies during October

and November 1963. Paraphrases of these cables, not revealing

sensitive sources and methods, were attached to CD 674. The

Agency further stated that the subject of the photo referenced

in these cables was not Oswald. It

further stated that:

"In response to our meeting of 12 March and your memo

of 16 March, Stern and Willens will review at Langley

the regional copies.of these 3 disseminations to the

Secret Service and the cables on which they were based, as

well as the photos of the unidentified man." (CIA,

p. 116444, of notes)

On March 26, William Coleman wrote in a memorandum for

the record:

"The CIA directed a memorandum to J. Lee Rankin on March 24,191

(Commission Document No. 631) in which it set forth the

dissemination of the information on Lee Harvey Oswald.

I realize that this memorandum is only a partial answer

to our inquiry to the CIA dated March 16, 1964 and I hope

that the complete answers

will give us the additional

information we requested."

The following day, as agreed by Warren Commission and

Agency representatives, Samuel Stern of the Commission visited

Murphy responded to Dulles' statement by stating that

the Commission's concern was understandable but that the Agency

felt the Commission's final report should make no mention of

Nosenko's information. Murphy indicated that a possible

alternative would be to use language "which would allude to

the existence of other, unverified information on the Oswald

case." This language, Murphy contended, would permit the

Warren Commission to state, if challenged on this point at a

future time, that it had given consideration to the Nosenko

information.

replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

the Committee has determined that the CIA did not provide

Calderon's conversation to the Warren Commission, thus,

even though the Warren Commission was aware that Calderon

had connections to intelligence work, as did other Cuban

Embassy officers, the vital link between her background

and her comments was never established for the Warren Com-

mission by the CIA. The Agency's oversight in this re-

gard may have forecassed the Commission from actively

pursing a lead of great significance.

• In that cable Mann stated:

...Washington should urgently consider feasi-

bility of requesting Mexican authorities to

arrest for interrogation: Eusebio Azcue,

Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal. The

men are Cuban national and Cuban consular

officers. Luisa Calderon is a secretary in Cuban

This cable does not state the basis for arresting

Calderon. However, the CIA's copy of this cable bears

handwritten notation on its routing page.

states: "Info from Amb Mann Sur

Mann went on to state in urgent terms:

"They may quickly be returned to Havana in order

to eliminate any possibility that Mexican govern-

ment could use them as witnesses."

According to CIA files, Calderon returned to Havana

on December 16, 1963, less than four weeks after the as-

sassination.

Calderon, Azcue and Mirabal were not arrested nor

detained for questioning by the Mexican federal police.

However, Silvia Duran, a friend and associate of Calderon's

and the one person believed to have had repeated contact

with Oswald while he was in Mexico City, was arrested and

questioned by the Mexican police on two separate occasions

(Cites). During her reinterrogation, Duran was questioned,

Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,

1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to

the CIA's Mexico City Séêtion and to the Chief of the CIA's

Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). That dis-

patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data

on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico

City. At page three of the attached report Luisa Calderon

was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's commercial

office.

to locate the report.

paraphrased AMMUG's

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned about

17 March 1964, shortly before I made a trip to

Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico.

The information to which

I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange

that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from

the DGI althought she apparently did not do any

work for the Service. (The case officer) told

me that hers was a peculiar case and that he

himself believed that she had been recruited in

Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-

though Manuel Pineiro, the Head of the DGI, did

not agree.

As I recall, (the case officer) had

investigated Luisa Calderon.

This

was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the GI had

intercepted a letter to her by an American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar.

As you know,

the pronunciation of

Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so

I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan

dez should be spelled. It could have been "Howard"

or something different.

professional relationship between the writer and
