phone numbers contained in subject's address book.

Recontact MM 1169-PC for further infornation

regarding subject's activity.

ADMINISTRATIVE

During the month of February, 1971, SA PETER C.

CLEMENTE, the case agent, was out the entire month on sick

leave and no investigation of the subject other than contact

of an informant was possible.

Delay in submission of a report in this matter was

due to SA CLEMENTE's 11lness, heavy involvement in police

school matters, Title III specials, and trials.

No further effort will be made to locate JOHN THANOS

whose check stamped insufficient funds was found in subject's

possession. Papers of subject indicate receipt of the check

during the

operation of his vending machine business.

INFORMANIS

MM T-1 15 JAMES HARRIS, Loan Officer and Vice Pres1-

dent, Central Bank and Trust Company.

MM T-2 is MM 1169-PC.
