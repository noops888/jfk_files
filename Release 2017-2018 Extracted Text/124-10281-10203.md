CCNIDENTAL

Concerning assurances that/

wanted that his

cooperation would be made known to all government agencies

which should know of his cooperation, it was pointed out

that no such assurances could be given him and, further,

that concealment of his

identity made it impossible to

advise other agencies of his cooperation.

was additionally advised that the Bureau

appreciated his cooperation but that his actions in this

regard had to be completely voluntary and that he could

not be directed

or guided in any way.
