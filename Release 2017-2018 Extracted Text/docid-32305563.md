Re:

John: RoselM

Approtinately a year ago a very valuable and

sensitive informant, who hinself has long been a

member

of

La Cosa Nostra, furnished information on an extremely

confidential basis that Roselli's true name is Filippo Sacco,

who was brought to this country from a town near Naples, Italy,

by his immigrant parents when Roselli was but a small child.

According to the informant, the Sacco family

settled in

Boston,

Massachusetts, where Roselli's mother and other

family

members still reside.

The informant relates that Roselli has

continued to maintain in secrecy his true identity and connection

with Boston but has

for many years sent a sum of money each

year for his mother's use.

Only a very few people know of

this background and the transmittal by Roselli of money to his

mother .

"Elaborately careful and secretive methods are used in

transmitting the money to Roselli's mother in order to avoid

the possibility of his true identity becoming known.

The informant was of the opinion that the

motive of

Rosellis concealment of true background was that he may

. be

wanted for a very serious crime committed in the Boston area

in the early 1920s, possibly as an accomplice of Tancredi Tortora,

who was known by the informant to be in the los Angeles and

San Francisco, California, areas in the early and middle

1920s,

both reportedly in a fugitive status.

Tancredi Tortora has

been identified as the individual now residing in Acerra, Italy,

who was charged with a murder committed in Boston in 1922 but

who was not apprehended and convicted until 1934.

After

serving part of a life sentence, Tortora was paroled from

Massachusetts State Prison and deported to his native Italy

February, 1951.

Tancredi Tortora, mentioned above,

is the same

individual concerning whon you made inquiry

through the Italian

National Police, the results of which were contained in

letterhead memorandum of 9/2/64 and transmitted to the Bureau

under cover letter of the same date.

Your letterhead memorandum

set forth that Tancredi. Tortora together with his brothers,

Parigi and Comizio, are dealers in fruit and vegetables and

reside an Corso Italia Street, Acerra, Italy. It is also set

forth that the son of Parigi Tortora, Carmine, is an officer

in the U. S. Navy.
