ADMINISTRATIVE

As the Bureau was advised by reairtel, this

report has been delayed in order to obtain the results of

the trial in U. S. District Court, Pittsburgh, of subject,

his brother, and their associates on charges of income tax

fraud and evasion, plus conspiracy.

During the period of this report, liaison has

been closely

maintained with Intelligence Division, Internal

Revenue Service, Pittsburgh, which has an investigation

underway regarding this subject.

Bureau that on 11/18/63 PCI|

nadia 11/19/62, Pittsburab advised the

advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, as follows

that date at about 4:30 P.M., SAM MANNARINO

stated "they" intended to try to get to Mrs. BROWN, wife

of Allegheny County Judge HOMER S. BROWN, who had been

selected to the jury in U.S. District Court, Pittsburgh,

that day.

MANNARINO said

the BROWNs had a daughter who

was going with the son of PAUL LONG, Pittsburgh Radio and

Television News Commentator, and the approach would be

made through PAUL LONG.

When asked how he knew LONG would

go for the deal, MANNARINO laughingly said he was positive

LONG would go for it.

It is noted that Judge BROWN and his wife,

Mrs. WILHELMINA B. BROWN, are of the Negro race, and the

PAUL LONG family is Caucasian.

The above information was furnished to U. S.

Attorney GUSTAVE DIAMOND, Pittsburgh, who was scheduled to

commence presentation of

the Government case against subjects

on November 19, 1963, on charges of income tax evasion.

USA DIAMOND requested that no active investigation be made

to prove or disprove the above allegation at that time for

in an effort to ascertain whether or not attempts to contact

Mrs. BROWN had been made and if they had been successful.

On 11/21/63, PCI L

advised SA FORSYTH as follows:

On 11/20/63, SAM MANNARINO stated that the "contact"

had been made with "Judge BROWN's wife."

indicate that the results of the contact had been successful

from his point of view and, in fact, appeared to be deeply

BROWN's son going with the daughter of PAUL LONG, rather

than

BROWN's daughter going with LONG's son, as had been

previously stated.

The above information was furnished to USA GUSTAVE

DIAMOND, Pittsburgh, on 11/21/63.

No further information regarding the above

allegations was furnished by PCI or any other source.

SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III as follows:

On 11/20/63, SAM MANNARINO stated that the "contact"

has been made with "Judge Brown's wife."

MANNARINO did

not indicate that the results of the contact had been

successful from his point of view and, in fact, appears to

be deeply worried about the outcome of the trial. MANNARINO

changed one part of his story in that he now referred to

Judge BROWN's son going with the daughter of PAUL LONG,

rather than BROWN's daughter going with LONG's son, as

had

been previously stated.

The above information was furnished to USA GUSTAVE

DIAMOND, Pittsburgh, Pa., on 11/21/63.

The trial of the MANNARINOs in USDC, Pittsburgh,

on income tax fraud and evasion charges, is estimated by

USA DIAMOND to be about half over and may be concluded by

11/29/63. Although a report is slightly past due in each

of the MANNARINO cases, Pittsburgh will, in the interest

of continuity, delay the reports until the conclusion of the

trial VACB.
