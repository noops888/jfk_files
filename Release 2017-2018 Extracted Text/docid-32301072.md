claim and for any indication that he has B-26 aircraft as

and other logical sources for any indication that Cuban radio

has announced the interception of any intruder aircraft which was

driven off by anti-aircraft fire.

may be propaganda move by him aimed at publicizing activities of

his group to facilitate his collection of funds to carry out

attacks against Cuba.

tion attached. Include in the memorandum the data which appeared

in the above-mentioned Washington, D.C., newspaper as well as any
