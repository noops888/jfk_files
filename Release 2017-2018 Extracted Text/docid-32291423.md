DL 94-55A-SUB

On 3/21/63, Bureau Agents noted that LITTLE's car was

gone from his Irving, Texas residence at 8:30 AM, which is a

departure from his usual routine. Efforts are being made to locate

his new place of operation.

On 3/21/63, PCIL

activity by Bureau Agents around the Redmen

had caused the members to become quite upset to the point where

they now had signs in the club room, demanding that members play

cards only, not discuss any bookmaking activities whatsoever, or

discuss any betting activity.

PCI also advised he had heard

from Dallas gambler EDDIE TOM GREEN that COX and LITTLE were again

operating as bookmakers and had a place "out in the county", no

in the vau

further description.

The above information was furnished to Lt. JACK REVILL,

Intelligence Section, Dallas PD and Deputy BOB MORGAN, Intelligence

Section, Dallas County SO, on 3/22/63.
