RET: WAVE 9311, 14 JUlY 1964

1.

Prior to his currant tolp fur training, ACLATISN/l

permisalon to make a stopover 10 ZRETAl on his retur

to JRAVE to inquire about the status of his citizenship." "e.

ofjured instoad to have the matter looked into during his train-

ins course and then, lf there was anything his presence in

ZRUETAL could accomplish, to have arrangements made for appropriate

contacts.

To this end he submitted a memorandum outlining his

recollection of the history of his case. It is paraphrased in

stanile form below.

In 194950, for approsinatoly 16 months, 1 vorked

- Identity A. Before taking the appointment I consulted with

Identity B, who warned ne that I was endangering sy citizenshi?,

but also promised to help in case of trouble because I had offered

to cooperate fully with ODEARl. It so happened that I quickly

worked my

way up to the rank of Sergeant and was detailed to liaison

WITH ODYOKE agencies.

This facilitated my volunteering Inforation

not normally given in liaison contacte and even my fulfilling of

requirements lovied by then,

particularly ODFARL and DACID.

bo

I belleve that it mut have been Identity C who

made the charge that deprived me of my citizenship on the techni

callty. that to have achleved my rank and position I must be

considered & PBRIEN citizen. Identity C and I had crossed

swords over a lIlend of wine who had been refused a PBPRIME visa.

Latar Idertity C was fired for having been involved in a visa

selling racket.
