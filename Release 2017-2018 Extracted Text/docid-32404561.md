RE: ARRB Additional Information Request No. CIA-6

Dear John:

As a part of our examination of the documentary record surrounding the assassination

of President Kennedy, we would like to conduct a systematic review of cable and

dispatch traffic between the CIA's Mexico City station, CIA headquarters, and

JMWAVE during the period immediately surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald's visit to

Mexico City and the assassination of President Kennedy. It is our understanding that

although copies of many of the cables and dispatches are already in the Oswald and JFK

files, not all cables and dispatches are included.

We hereby formally request the CLA to assemble all of the cable traffic and dispatches

for the period September 26, 1963 through October 20, 1963 and November 22, 1963

through December 30, 1963 between: (a) the Mexico City station and headquarters, and

(b) the Mexico City station and JMWAVE.

Because it may be appropriate in the future for us to examine all similar traffic between

CIA headquarters and JMWAVE during this period, would you please provide us with

your best reasonable estimate of the amount of time and effort that would be entailed in

assembling cables and dispatches between headquarters and IMWAVE for the same

period identified above?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,

SIGN

Dear Mr.. Gunn:

Re: ARRB Request No. CIA 6, for Information

CIA Cable Traffic For Specific Periods

The following is responsive to referent request.

Via referent request, the ARRB asked for additional

information on cable traffic and dispatches between CIA

headquarters, Mexico City and JMWAVE.

Specifically, the

staff asked that the Agency provide as a package all such

cables and dispatches for the periods 26 September through

20. October 1963, and 22 November through 30 December 1963.

As you know, within the sequestered collection, there

are several chronological dispatch/cable collections, but

the earliest that any of them commence is 1 October 1963.

In general cable traffic and dispatches are not available as

a chronological collection and

through 30 September 1963, it is not possible to provide

cables and dispatches in a chronological/package form.

During the periods in question, the Office of Communications

(OC) only held cables long enough to ensure that they were

successfully transmitted to the named recipient.

On

occasion, because processes and resources required to

perform cleanup activity varied, cables were sometimes

for longer periods but not with

held

the intention of creating a

long-term reference collection.

In addition, the offices of record for the origination

of cable traffic and dispatches did not create cable and

dispatch files for reference collection purposes.

The

originating office maintained a temporary paper cable

chrono, usually retained for not more than ninety days.

Then, because this temporary chrono copy was not the

"official" or "record" copy, it was destroyed. Accordingly,

NW 53217 DocId:32404561 Page 8

## Page 9

we can only assume that those chronological compilations

which do exist were assembled and preserved solely because

of the assassination of the President and, none had an

earlier start date than 1 October 1963.

There is no electronic repository for cables and

dispatches from the stations.

Once cables were printed out

they went to the addressee and then into specific files.

If you require anything further in this regard, please

advise.

Sincerely,

Barry Harrelson
