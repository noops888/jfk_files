MARCELINO GARCIA JIMINEZ, Of MIRR, contacted MM 639-S at

his home and elaborated upon his plans.

BOSCH explained that

he had met with a very important man who agreed to pay

BOSCH $1,000 for a small raid and that if it succeeds, this

man, identity unknown to MM 639-S, would furnish $20,000

said that he would provide a Cuban to serve as bombardier,

four 100-pound bombs and money for MV 639-5 to rent a plane.

He said that after the raid succeeded, he would make certain

BOSCH

emphasized that only three people, BOSCH, GARCIA and

"MIMO" (GERVELIO GUTIERREZ CONCEPCION) know about these

plans, in addition to MM 639-S. RA)

On April 1, 1966, MM 639-S reported that on

March 30, 1966, he accompanied BOSCH and a Cuban known to

him only

as "GUAJIRO" to Marathon, Florida, in the Keys,

where they inspected the airport and BOSCH decided upon

plan for the raiding plane to depart from this point for

Cuba.

He desires MM 639-S to rent an Aerocommander twin-

engine plane in the Miami area, fly it to Marathon, Fla.,

He suggested that MM 639- leave the plane at a particular

the field shortly after midnight.

In the meantime, four

bombs and a Cuban bombardier will have been placed

It is also felt that a reasonable delay by

MM 639-s in setting the date for this operation will,

enable him

to obtain more detailed information

such as eaten to cris and explosives cache. CoU

Both Customs and this office are of the opinion

that an appropriate roadblock in the Florida Keys, north-

east of Marathon, manned by Customs and the Border Patrol

(as trequently decurs), will achieve the desired results. 'll

It is to be noted that. BÖSCH and GARCIA are

scheduled for trial on 6/7/66, on Federal extortion case

in Miami.

In the opinion of this office, a Neutrality Act

orosecution in this case would be impossible withou

exposing MM 639-5, whereas Customs can stop the raid

by seizing the

bombs with good prospects of prosecution

under the Munitions Control Act without involving MM 639-S.(

MM 639-S and close liaison with Customs in accordance
