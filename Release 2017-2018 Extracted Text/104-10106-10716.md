engineer by the SCHLUMKRGIR Company, Paris, France, received & letter

dated 27 July 1952 at Moscow from one Siegtied Btefanovitch MOROSOFT,

asking MARIIN for speclallied Information concerning geophysics. The

letter requested thet MARTIN's reply be forwarded to Moscow through an Inter-

mediary. Fron January 1932 unt1l April 1937 MARTIN represented the SCHLUMBERGER

Company In Russia as an engineer, and It was thought that the correspondence

fron MOROSOFT may represent a Soviet attempt to resuns contact with MARTIN

and develop clandestine relations with him. The FBI conducted an Investi

gation dated Ime 1953 and determined that Maurice Henri MARTIN resided

at Nod H1l1, Wilton, Connecticut and ras employed by the SCHLUMBERGER

Well Surveying Co., Ridgefleld, Connecticut. Informants advised that
