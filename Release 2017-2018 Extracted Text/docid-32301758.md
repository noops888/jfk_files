ADMINISTRATIVE

One extra copy of this report is being forwárded

to the Bureau in the event dissemination to Legat, Havana,

is desired.

One copy of this report is being furnished the

New York Office for information,

due to the interest of

that office in Cubana Airlines.

One copy of this report is being designated to

INS locally due to the investigative interest of that

agency in defected personnel

of Cubana.

A separate investigation is being conducted con-

cerning MANUEL MAGARINO DORTICOS, (Miami File 105-2279,

Bureau File 105-85224):

On September 20, 1960, SANTIAGO L. FONT advised

that he is seeking other employment, since working condi-

tions in Cubana Airlines have become intolerable since the

arrival of FAES, in addition to the obvious Communist domi-

nation of the Cuban government.

This report is being classified Secret due to

the highly sensitive nature of information reported by

5)LMM 709-S*| and New York NY 2494-S*Jand also since this

ceport involves investigative coverage.of a foreig

liplomatic establishment In the U. s.

tains information reported by informants, the disclosure

of which would tend to compromise the future effectiveness

of these,

informants and possibly tend to reveal their iden-

tities.

It is observed that most of the defected flight

personnel from Cubana Airlines have been absorbed into the

Democratic Revolutionary Front and have departed from the

Miami area.

"Cubana planes must carry enough fuel from Havana

for a round trip flight..

Frequently to do this the

line must lighten its passenger list and load up with

extra gasoline. .... Because of this short payload,

Cubana carried only half of its scheduled passengers

to New York Saturday.

And it had to cancel a flight

to Madrid when the British-Dutch controlled Shell

Oil Company refused to refuel the flight at Bermuda

and Lisbon.

Shell Oil was taken over in Cuba by

CASTRO, along with Esso Standard and Texaco. The

three companies said the Cuban government owes them

nearly seventy million dollars for oil they have im-

ported within the past year..

When they refused to

refine Russian oil, CASTRO seized their Cuban opera-

tions."
