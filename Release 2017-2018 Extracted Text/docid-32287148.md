Re your airtel 10-26-62.

Bureau authority is granted to conduct a survey and, if

feasible, to install a misur at the Tri-City Textile Company,

Old Forge, Pennsylvania, and to secure the necessary leased line

in connection with this

installation.

This

matter should be closely followed to insure that

the source is developed with the least possible delay consistent

with security.

Subnit FD

143 within 30 days alter installation.

NOTE: Philadelphia was previously authorized to install this misur,

however,

their request was resubmitted in view of the increased

estimate in cost of the leased line from $1 to $3 per mile each

month. Philadelphia now advises that the leased line cost will be

approximately $350 to $400 a month. This method of monitoring the

sgurce at the Philadelphia technical plant will be considerably

39

ass expensive since the operation of a separate plant would require

transferring an employee to the resident agency plus the expense of

leasing separate space:

This source will be monitored at the

Steganical plant in conjunction with other misurs, thus reducing the

galaxy expense to a fraction of one employee. Bufalino is one of

The 40

target subjects and a principal racket figure in the Eastern

Penn

sylvania area.

He is closely associated with leading hoodlums

tho

garment industry

in New York, Chile. Bufalino utilizes the

Tri-City

Textile Company as

meeting place.
