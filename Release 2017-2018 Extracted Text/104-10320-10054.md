Subj : Request for Information under FOLA on OSWALD

We have attached a copy of the print-out on OSW.. D from the

U.S. Defector Machine Program, a sub-program of the Soviet GICS

Machine Program. (The 26 page computer print-out to which IMr.

Lane makes reference is probably the file content listing.

It is

remarkable that FOLA requests now and then indicate leaks of

information.) Under the terms published in the Federal Register,

we are not obligated to provide (a) material from newspapers, books,

and other overt sources; nor (b) information provided by other USG

agencies; nor. (c) information provided by foreign services.

Data

from those three sources have been marked in yellow, leaving only

some 16 lines. (The sources are SB Division's SPR filed in 201-305052

and HMMA-31932.. I assume that both of these sources involve foreign

liaison, and hence are exempt.) In any case, there is nothing in the

machine summary which is not covered by the 201. I you want to send

the machine dossier along to DDO/FOIO, I have no objection, but nothing

from this machine dossier should be passed to the regester.
