It appeared that ALEX stayed in Geneva with the

intention of skiing at Chamonix and neighboring re-

sorts, but decided to return to Pontresina because

of lack of snow.

While in Geneva, ALEX made telephone inquiries,

not further described, of Swissair and Alitalia Air-

lines.

He also called the Hotel Hilton in Rome, re-

questing that his hat, which he had left there,

should be forwarded to Pontresina.
