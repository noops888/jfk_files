was also upset about the fact that JACK KRESS and HASKELI

-JONES of New Orleans, Louisiana, had allowed

themselves to

be caught with invoices

reflecting shipments

to other

subjects, because they should have known that searches by

FBI Agents would be forthcoming.

i.:.

JAMES told the informant that 'everybody, including

the big boys, are shook up!''over the recent gambling arrests

and searches.

JAMES commented that the main point they are

afraid of is the fact that the searches of JONES of New

Orleans and KRESS of Tulsa, might reveal shipments of crooked

gambling equipment to Las Vegas, Nevada. JAMES did not

further elaborate on this comment.

On/ 10/3766,

TN 14-C advised that JAMES had commented

that_ CARLOS MARCELLO of New Orleans, Louisiana, was "framed

by the FBI at the New Orleans National Airport on 9/30/66.

JAMES was referring to the incident where MARCELLO struck

a Bureau Agent at New Orleans following his (MARCELLO's)

arrival from New York City on 9/30/66.

JAMES further

claimed that MARCELLO would not be convicted on the assault

charge because no one could prove that MARCELLO knew the

man was

an FBI Agent. JAMES further indicated that MARCELLO

has not been on the Mississippi Gulf Coast recently; however,

The did not elaborate on this point.

on 10/3/66, JN 14-C also advised that CARL DOUGLAS

WHITE, aka "TOWHEAD' WHITE, well known Mississippi hoodlum

who was recently convicted for possession of untaxed alcohol,

will be out of the penitentiary soon as the result of some

"string pulling" in Washington, D.C., by one "HOWARD" from

north Mississippi.

Further identification or description

of "HOWARD" is unknown. WHITE allegedly has the state

charge flea pending against him in Mississippi "fixed"

•and

will never serve a day. Allegedly this will cost him

approximately $30,000, reportedly payable directly to

Mississippi Governor PAUL BO JOHNSON. "The informant did

not make any Inquiry for specifies and could not vouch

for the veracity of this alleged payoff to Governor JOHNSON.
