IA 4396-C* advised that ROSSELLI was residing at

his Los Angeles apartment on 1/11, 1/12, 1/13 and 1/14/63.

HAI, ROACH, JR., Motion Picture Producer, was inter-

viewed on 1/9/63 in connection with another Anti-Racketeering

investigation.

On this occasion he was also interviewed

concerning: his business relationship with JOHN ROSSELLI and

JOSEPH J. BREEN,

IR. in theirplans to make movies of the floor

shows in

the casinos in las Vegas, Nevada.

ROACH said that

the idea to make such a movie was

his and

that originally

BREEN and ROSSELLI were in the enterprise to obtain the con-

tracts from the casinos and to help with the filming. BREEN

and ROSSELLI did obtain contracts from nearly all of

• the

casinos but, against the advice of ROACH and CARROLL CASE, a

clause was engered in their contracts giving the casino own-

ers right to final approval of the film taken.

ROACH said

that no one would finance their picture with such a clause in

the contracts.

In any event they did not obtain financing

and their contracts expired.

BREEN and ROSSELLI said the

casinos would not sign new contracts unless the approval

clause was included.
