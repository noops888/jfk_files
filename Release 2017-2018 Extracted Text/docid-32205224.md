MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

The Department of Defense has now approved, with some

modifications, a plan developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff

to implement your instructions that renewed attention be given

to the induction of Cuban refugees into the U.S. Armed Forces.

Mental, moral and physical standards will be essentially

those in effect for the induction of Puerto Ricans, with some

These modifications include: lowering the mental

test score to 40 from 62, and no disqualification for dependents

or lack of facility in English.

The individuals accepted will be organized into Cuban units

through basic and advanced individual training:

At the end of

that time, they will either be selected for special forces training,

integrated into regular units or separated for the convenience of

â€¢the government.

It is hoped that as many as 1500 men can meet the reduced

standards.

Personally, I am very doubtful that any such figure

can be reached, primarily because of the problem of motivation.

As of 8 June 1961, 4152 Cubans had been interviewed. 734 had been

found acceptable under the old standards, and 122 volunteered for

induction into the armed services as follows: 17 Army, 15 Navy,

18 Marine Corps, 72 Air Force.

Of the 17 Army inductees, & requested

and received discharges at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 14 June

1962, upon finding that they were not being trained in preparation

for

an

invasion of Cuba.

Whether the new program will be more successful remains to

be seen.
