Subject was called at his Viami hone on 7 Hay 1965,

by the undersigned using the alias Albert Antonelli.

CISNEROS had attempted to contact his former case officer.

Alfonso Rodriguez, the day before, but failed.

Briefly, for the readers

not familiar with his

name ,

Rogelio CISNEROS was a former leader in the Junta

Revolucionaria (June), organized and directed by Manuel

prepare a study on the Cuban secondary education syster-

before

and after Fidel Castro.

All arrangement for parent

sum of

$1200 for eight-typewritten pages - double spaced, a

project any non-Cuban could have written in less time

and expense.

In November 1964 CISNEROS asked for an additional

$650 for the study so that he could enroll at the

University of lichigan's intensive isglish language course.

He was denied the additional sun, but went to the University

• CISNEROS stated that while at the University he

became acquainted

with some young Dominicans and reportedly

he developed a good rapport with the men.

He wondered out

loud if any use could be made of the friendship in view of

the

activities in Santo Domingo.

The undersigned listened

attentively, but made no effort to educe further information

on

this

subject.

as a recent "graduate", is interested in

Job and isplied that he would like to work for KuBArk.

The undersirned indicated to him that jobs were scarce. but

that his interest in enployment will be passed along

"my superiors".

The undersigned closed the conversation by

promising that he would call during the week of 10 May and

convey any message received from

"upstairs".

RECOMMENDATION: Unless the readers feel there may be

some value to CISNEROS' Dominican contacts, this writer opines

that we should not get involved with CISNEROS again, and that

he should be told there is

no work available for him at the

present, but should something open-up in the future we will

certainly keep him in mind.

Rea son:

After his resignation

in September 1964 CISNEROS wanted Al Burt, Miani Herald

reporter; to do a news story on RAY pointing up the following

facts:

That RAY was a tool of the U. S. State

Department and received $25.000 per month from the

U. S. Government.

(CISNEROS reportedly said that he

could doucment all facets of RAY's funding.)

That RAY knows his failure to infiltrate

Cuba embarrassed his State Department friends,

but

State will continue to back him as their betrayed

revolution thesis

can be tied only to RAY's star

and as

this theme has been sold to the United

States

Government at policy levels, despite the

objection of KUBARK,

State has no alternative but to

back RAY.

CISNEROS did not go through with this plan, but he will always"

use this as a peg to blackmail.

We have no obligation to

place CISNEROS on the KUBARK payrolls, either directly

indirectly.

He is undoubtedly witting of KBARK's financial

role in RAY's aborted attempts to infiltrate Cuba,

but

payments to RAY are untraceable. It is doubtfull that an

expose on ti, mi, PAY relationship would enlighten anyone,

as many reporters

have speculated that RAY was being assisted

y KUBARK or someother agency of the United States Government.

Should it be warranted, this writer is willing to

debrief CISNEROS furtber on his

Dominican friends.
