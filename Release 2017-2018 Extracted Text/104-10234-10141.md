4. MAJOR CUBELA WAS A POPULAR AND PROMINENT UNIVERSITY

STUDANT LEADER, AN ARDENT REVOLUTIONARY AND ONE OF THE EARLY

COHORTS

OF CASTRO DURING THE BATISTA REGINE. CUBELA WAS ALSO A CLOSE

FRIEND OF CASTRO AND UNTIL THE ARREST RANKED RICH ANONG THE LEADERS

OF THE REGIME, HIS ARREST AND ABJECT CONFESSION AT THE PUBLIC

TRIAL CONDUCTED IN STALINIST FASHION TRIGGERED OFF A SERIES OF

STUDENT REACTIONS. THE TRIAL IN EFFECT BACKFIRED AGAINST THE REGIME.

•. 5. UPI REPORTS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICES,

INCLUDING ACCOUNTS OF REFUGLES WHO DEPARTED RECENTLY FROM CUBA,

TESTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT ANTI-GOVT' STUDENT AGITATIONS OCCURRED.

WALL SCRIBBLINGS ON UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS THREATENED CASTRO, ONE

READING: "ONE HEAD PAYS FOR ANONIER,"' ANOTHER READ "OUT WITH FIDEL."

REQUESTED THE STATE PROSECUTOR NOT TO INPOSE THE DEATH SENTENCES.

7. THE CUBELA TRIAL HAS USED AS A PEG, I.E., GUILT BY

ASSOCIATION IN THE DISMISSAL AND CHARGES LEVIED AGAINST MAJOR

ANEI JEIRAS WHOSE LOYALTY TO THE REVOLUTION IS "UNDISPUTED" BY

CASTRO.

HOWEVER, AMEIJEIRAS WAS STRIPPED OF HIS MILITARY RANK

AYD CHARGED WITH THE CRIME OF BEING A PLAYBOY, LIVING THE GAY LIFE.

8. AMEIJEIRAS WAS ONE OF CASTRO'S FIRST PEVOLUTIONARY

FOLLOWERS, HE HAD BEEN WITH CASTRO SINCE 1956, HAS ONE OF THE

SURVIVORS OF THE GRANA EXPEDITION, FOUGHT IN THE SIERRA MAESTRA

IN 1957-58 AND HAD HELD HIGH OFFICE SINCE 1959. IN OCT 1965 HE WAS

NAMED TO THE HUNDRED MAN CENTRAL CONMITTEE OF THE CUBAN COMMUNIST

PARTY.

9. RUMORS ARE CIRCULATING THAT BLAS ROCA CALDERIO,

MEMBER OF THE SECRETARIAT OF THE CP AND CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSTITU-

TIONAL STUDIES COMMITTEE, WILL SHORTLY BE BROUGHT TO TRIAL.

SINILARLY, THE CHARGES OF MALPRACTICES AGAINST THE BINISTRY OF

FOREIGN AFFAIRS IMPUGNS THE LOYALTY OF FOREIGN MINISTER RAUL ROA

GARCIA HINSELF, ANOTHER MINISTER UNDER SUSPICION, I.E., GUILT BY

ASSOCIATION, IS PAURE CHOLON, MINISTER OF TRANSPORTATION. THE

10. THE UNDERLYING CAUSE FOR THE "SHONTRIAL" OF CUBELA,

THE ARREST OF THE DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENSE AND THE OUTLANDISH

HARGES BROUGHT AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE CP AND MINISTERIAL OFFICIALS

ARISES FROM THE IRREVERSIBLE FAILURES OF THE GOVT IN THE HANDLING

OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS. THE SCARCITY OF BASIC

FOOD PRODUCTS HAS WORSENED. RICE, ROOT CROPS, MILK, MEAT CONTINUE

TO BE RATIONED SEVERELY, AND THE AVAILABILITY TO THE CONSUMER IS

• NOW BELOW THE 1957-59 LEVEL, DESPITE SEVEN YEARS OF "COMMUNIST

PLANNING". THERE ARE SERIOUS SHORTAGES OF MEDICINE, TEXTILES AND

HOUSING. THE LATTER HAS DETERIORATED IN URBAN AREAS TO A LEVEL

FAR BELOW PRE-WAR STAVDARDS. SIMILARLY, CASTRO REPORTED THAT THE

SUGAR CROP THIS YEAR WILL FALL FAR BELOW TILE SIX MILLION TONS

HARVESTED IN 19G5. SINCE SUGAR ACCOUNTS FOR SOME 80%.0F TOTAL

FOREIGN TRADE EARNINGS, 1966 INCOME FROM SUGAR SALES, FACED WITH

DEPRESSED WORLD MARKET PRICES, WILL NOT IN ANY WAY MEET THE COST

OF BASIC IMPORTS, ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINING THE NATIONAL ECONOMY.

CASTRO HAS SOUGHT TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE ECONOMY BY PER-

MITTING THE EXODUS OF SOME 400 REFUGEES PER MONTH RHO ARE STREAJING
