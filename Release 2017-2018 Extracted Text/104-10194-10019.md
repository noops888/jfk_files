to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore

more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts

than in that of more than s.ort-range operational developnent.

Subject's operational situation makes it impossible for him to

attempt recruitments.

Thus, his very rezl achievements are not

by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to

be copious.

He could, however, further improve the selectivity

of the leads provided the station and make more of an effort to

"digest" the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function,

he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility.

ile is careful

with operational expenses

and has exercised good security.

During the period under review, additional efforts have been

made to make full use of subject's potential and integrate him

further in the work of the station component with which he works.

He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs

directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

although our initial impressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred

an "s" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately

deserve an

"o", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.

MoreoveI, I believe the overall rating would more properly have

been ir the higher range of the "p" category, rather than "s",

but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,

who is more intimately and directly involved with subject on a

Section D3 continued

from the Organization, his continued presence at this Station definitely

appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite

conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat

longer period than that reflected by this report.

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to

direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more

aggressive efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity

to the primary Station targets.

This officer does bring many talents to bear

on his operational activity: he has absolutely fluent

and a vast range of contacts in the local community.

Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in

depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue

then actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina-

tion from further development, for whatever reason.

In sum, in spite of the recognized and commendable improvement in this

officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits

that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would morc properly have

been a "P", and that the overall rating, at this point, would more accurately

be set at a level between "P" and "S", probably closer to the former than

the latter.

Thie reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared

the Fitness Report.

Since the Reviewing Officer In the field has not indicated his views

I would like to make a comment of my own.

wishing to detract fron

anything the Supervisor has said about Subject's per-

that the ratings given him in this report are

as such, are inconsistent with the grading patteru of the Division as a whole.

reporting in general, despite the burdens imposed by the necessity for minimizing

be destred.

Other than the funds for operstional activities, this employee eurrently has no

responsibility. for the prograiming and use of personnel, space, equipment, and

funds.

His dedication

to and enthusiasm for accepting the challenge ofthis assignment, and his willingness

to continue on in 1t, deserve particular mention, particularly since he would. per

haps Justifiably feel that his present assignment may leave him outaide the main-

stream of competitive organization progression.

This employee's health and fanily situations

leave nothing to be desired, as his

vuring the perlod covered by this report he has displayed great industry and

devotion to duty in a varlety of circumstances and achieved notable results

In production and in-the creation of both short and long-tern assets for his

unit. On the debit side I would say that he is somewhat too businesslike in

many personal situations to the point of being almost humourless.

The very facts of

In terns of reporto, operational data, and Joint enterprises while, overall,

he has established enduring professional relationships frou which the
