SUBJECT: La Re: The IRO's ARRB Declarations

Fred, This is a followup to my LN of Friday. Please refer to D/OIM's memo to the DDs of 12 August (OIM 98-0088).

I have talked to Barry and we agree that the most important steps needed for the DO certification are as follows:

1. Your own title and duties, and your experience.

2. A detailed description of the searches wich have been undertaken in all parts of the DO since 1933 on benalt of the Board.. li you

have any insight as to how the searches at the time of the Warren Commission and the Church Commission were done - which led to

Assassination related documents--this would also be helpful)

3. A description of DO Briefings provided to ARRB staffers.

If we can get the above information, Eileen I. and Gary B. can put together a package which includes the individual responses provided to

the Board.

It is critical that we get on this soonest. We need a final product by WEDNESDAY and, as you can see, this is a big job.

Thanks for your help. Sim O.

Re: The IRO's ARRB Declarations

Fred, Yes, these are two distinct actions. The option for the Board was that they would receive detailed declarations from each of the

DDs to the Board or there would have to be internal declarations that would support the declaration before the EXDIR or GC could sign

for the agency. . The decision was to go with internal declarations and the Agency declaration will specifically say that certifications

have been made by each of the directorates. And that means that the DO will have to do one which looks something like the sample we

gave you. We need to get together soonest to determine how it can be done in time (early part of next week). Jim O.

I guess I'm a little confused in that the example looks more like the directorate certification that needs to be done prior to the Agency. I

thought you were focused only on the EB being sent electronically. On the assumption the a memo will be acceptable for stating the EB

was distributed I have started in that direction.
