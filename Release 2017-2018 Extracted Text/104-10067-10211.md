1. ASCA has advised that a draft of the final report, 1200 pages

on all aspects of the investigation, will be ready for an informal review

on Friday, 2 March, at 0900, in Room 3381, House Annex 2.

2. We have been asked to read the report and to compile all of our

comments on security aspects upon a single copy to be returned to

Mr. Blakey when we have finished. Blakey hopes to end up with an un-;

classified document by the end of the review and will look to us for help

in reaching that point. He will circulate the unclassified document: to

the former members of the Committee for comment on Monday. Their

returned comments, along with any substantive comments we may wish to makes

will be consolidated into a clean draft toward the end of next week and be

submitted to us under the five-day rule for release.

Please arrange for a

representative from your office to

be present at this review and advise
