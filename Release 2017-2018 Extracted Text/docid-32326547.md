In view of the serious implications of infiltration of

telephonically supplied to CIA on 12-15-60 and confirmed

in writing

(105-76826-17)

CIA by letter 12-16-60 advised of receipt of data from one

of its contacts who had received it from Julia Cellini that the

Cellini brothers have long been associated in the narcotics and white

slavery rackets in Cuba.

Reportedly the Cellini brothers planned to

support the FRD in hopes

of moving in on their old business after

overthrow of Castro.

During a White Slave Traffic Act investigation in 1945

it was alleged that both Julia Cellini and Dino V. Cellini were

I TOTAL DENIAL

Santo Trafficante and personally:knew Americans: holding Large

gambling interests in Havana including Frank Erickson. He

furnished extensive data on hoodlums and gambling.

Beginning in

1958, Legal Attache was authorized to pay him up to $100

monthly for services.

His, discontinuance in May

,1960, was

prompted by his return to U.S.

Legal Attache felt he was stable,

responsible family man. (137-4014)

(u)

In connection with a security

Investigation in 1957 it

was established that Benvenuto M. Cellini is apparently the father

Files of Identification Division contain no arrest records

for Benvenuto, Julia

Edward and Goffredo Cellini on basis of name

search. Dino

Cellini has record of only two convictions (1941 and

1945) on gambling charges.

Background of Cellini family does not indicate they could

make contributions of millions of dollars but definitely points

to possibility Cellini brothers are fronting for gambling interests.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

seat

Attached is letter to CIA advising that Agency of the

additional data received. In view of CIA's support of böth Varona

and FRD we are asking CIA whether it has obtained any verification

of these allegations and whether it has received any other data

indicating financial backing of anti-Castro elements by U.S. gambling

interests.

In view of critical public reaction which could be expected:

to follow the reactivation of large-scale gambling operations in Cuba

by top hoodlums should Castro be overthrown, recommend Investigative

intelligence standpoint.
