Miller advised that House Assassinations Conmittee Chairman Stokes is

pushing for some independent audit of our excisions of material provided in

connection with their investigation.

A lengthy discussion followed on the

merits of establishing a special review mechanism. The Director noted that

an option would be for him and Chairman Stokes to review any issues that might

grow out of the Committee's random samples.

The Director asked Lapham and

Miller to come up with the best option, although in his judgment a DCI/Chair-
