NEW YORK DIVISION

COL-X3

REC/39

NY 4860-PC was interviewed on 2/24/65, 3/18/65,

3/31/65 and 4/23/65.

To date, informant has not furnished any

information of value regarding the organized underworld's

activities.

He willingly meets with SAS FRANK R. GERRITY and

JEROME N. BOWERS and appears cooperative about discussing

burglars, check passers, pimps and prostitutes, but has not

furnished any information of value concerning the above.

On 3/30/65, shortly after the EMILE GRIFFITH VS.

JOSE

STABLE fight for the Welterweight Title, informant,

during conversation, said that STABLE was controlled by

TONY "Pro

ROVENZANO

On 4/23/65, informant was specifically asked about

JOSEPH FARACCO aka - FUGITIVE; CRV, NY File 76-2663. Informant

said he knew subject as GEORGIE FARACCO and stated that we should

save our time and forget about looking for "Georgie". Informant

said that "Georgie" was

"dumped" about two years ago.

Informant

added that he is personally acquainted with "Georgie's" wife and

she believes her husband to be dead.

It is believed by the NY that since informant

willingly meets with Special Agents and will discuss some

criminal matters, further efforts should be made to develop

this informant as an active top echelon criminal

informant.
