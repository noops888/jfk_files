assured this office that subject is

It snot that t Meten mirated, repeated on

their stop lists at the various ports of entry to

be denied

entry into Mexico.. Yet he is almost certain to have entered

Mexico probably on several occasions since the issuance of

the stop notice.

Experience has shown that such stop notices

are not particularly effective, both because of the enormous

volume of tourists entering Mexico and because of the venality

of the Immigration Agents.

By far the most convenient direct access to Mexico

is by air to the Mexico City International Airport.

It is

considered that the stops placed at this airport are the most

effective because of the more orderly operation, higher caliber

of personnal and the number of inspectors involved, and

especially since the stop there was regularly re-emphasized by and int

known to be backed by high governmental officials.

Therefore it

was considered that it would have been precarious for the subject

to fly into Mexico City and that this convenient access to his

property in Cuernavaca had been denied him!

Subject's spearance in Merida suggests

that he is

using this method to avoid immigration scrutiny at the Mexico City

Airport.

Incoming international flights clear Customs at Merida

and subsequently upon arrival at Mexico City may freely pass

to their ground transportation. It would be relatively simple

to make an

"arrangement" at the Merida Airport to insure no

difficulty, and subject gould, for example, pass freely between

Florida and Mexico City.

The Bureau

and Chicago willibe kept advised of

developments.
