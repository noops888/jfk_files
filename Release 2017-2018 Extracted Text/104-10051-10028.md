In view of the foregoing, the allegations

The following

convents are keyed to matters raised by ESPINOSA:

A. The AMLASH conspiracy - As detailed by

(IN 28631) 0n 6 April 1965, AUSPORT-I reporting on a neeting

of the AlLiSh group, including AMiHIa-1 mentioned the following

significant polnts:

(1) KUBARK was criticized for "fooling around tor

years" without helping and for jeopardizing the operation;

(2) the group was to de prepared to denounce

Obloks as resporsible it the operation tails and believed

the resulting seaadal would rake the lay of Plos sest insigui-

Ilcant; and

(3) AJILASH-3 was in touch with Cuban Intelligence

as established by coded messages which he exhibited.

As reported by

71532 (IN 32339) on 4 June 1965, baged on

meetings with ESPINOSA, the probleu seen by

The annoying thing in

this connection now is that ESPINOSA bas talkeù about it to
