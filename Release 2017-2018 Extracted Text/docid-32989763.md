T-l stated that during the week long seminar

there were the usual speeches. Dr. Ralph D. Abernathy

was presented by Reverend Joe

Lowery and Abernathy, greeted

the ministers.

Reverend T. Y. Rogers gave a resume of

the past year's achievements of MLTP in connection with

"Operation Breadbasket".

Dr. Gardner Taylor of Brookly

New York, led the memorial service for the late Dr.

Martin Luther King, Jr., on Monday night, September 23,

1968. During the week, Dr. Glasco Wilmore of the United

Presbyterian Church spoke on making a "positive" change in

history. Dr. C. S. Spivey of the National Council of

Churches spoke on the mission of the church to transform

our misguided society. Dr. Lucious Walker told the group

that the church is the most powerful agency to change

conditions in ghetto areas.

Dr. Archie Hargroves of the

Chicago University

that the mission of the church was

to support the disinherited people in their everyday

problems.

Reverend Robert Rhodes and Sampson Ranschumbush

said that America is still deeply involved in colonialism.

T-l stated that during the week there was much

inter SCLC politicking and bickering among the ministers;

nowever, there was also a great transier of ideas

and rumors.

I-1 stated that although there has been no official

confirmation, most of the ministers who attended this

seminar suspect that the SCLC officials in Atlanta, Georgia,

have set up some sort of security force to protect

the

leadership and to gather intelligence informtion on hate

groups and Government intelligence agencies.

that he

T-l stated

that he could not develop any positive details to support

this rumor.

In regard to the SCLC leadership, T-l stated

that most of the ministers were loyal to Ralph Abernathy;

however, they all fully realized that Abernathy is not a

good administrator and cannot compare with Jartin Luther

King, JI., as an organizer.

The major criticism of

Abernathy was that at the seminar and on several occasions

previous to the seminar; Abernathy has spoken of visions

which have come to him.

T-I stated that many of the national

leaders who attended the seminar were of the opinion

that Abernathy should not speak in public about his

visions.

Confidential Informant T-l said that there

were two major decisions made by SCLC at this seminar:

1. The MLTP is too disorganized at this

point to conduct a nation-wide economic

boycott; however, by this time next year

MLTP should be ready and probably the first

nation-wide economic boycott will have as

its target the A & P Food Chain Stores.

2.

MLTP leaders in all major United States

cities have been instructed to qualify

their churches as non-profit sponsoring

agents to secure United States Government

funds and build Government-financed housing

projects.

the position he holds today.

•*.

T-I stated that during the week long seminar

there were the usual speeches.

Dr. Ralph D. Abernathy

was presented by Reverend Joe Lowery and Abernathy, greeted

the ministers.

Reverend T. Y. Rogers gave a resume of

the past year's achievements of MLTP. in connection with

"Operation Breadbasket".

Dr. Gardner Taylor of Brooklyz

New York, led the memorial service for the late Dr.

Martin Luther King, Jr., on Monday night, September

23,

1968.

During the

week, Dr. Glasco Wilmore of the United

Presbyterian Church spoke on making a "positive" change in

history.

Dr. C. S. Spivey of the National Council of

Churches spoke on the mission of the church to transform

our misguided society. Dr. Lucious Walker told the group

that the church is the most powerful agency to change

conditions in ghetto areas. Dr. Archie Hargroves of the

Chicago University said

that the mission of

the church was

to support the disinherited people in their everyday

problems.

Reverend Robert Rhodes and Sampson Ranschumbush

said that America is still deeply involved in colonialism.

T-1

stated that during the week there was much

inter SCLC politicking and bickering among the ministers;

however, there was also a great transier of ideas and rumors.

I-I stated that although there has

been no official

confirmation, most of the ministers who attended this

seminar suspect that the SCLC officials in Atlanta, Georgia,

have set up some sort of security force to protect

the

leadership and to gather intelligence inforsation on hate

groups and Government intelligence agencies.

T-1 stated

that he could not develop any positive details to support

this rumor.

In regard to the SCLC leadership, T-l stated

that most of the ministers were loyal to Ralph Abernathy;

however, they all fully realized that Abernathy is not a

good administrator and cannot compare with Martin Luther

King, Jr., as an organizer.

The major criticism of

Abernathy was that at the seminar and on several occasions

previous to the seminar; Abernathy has spoken of visions

which have come to him.

I-l stated that many of the national

leaders who attended the seminar were of the opinion

that Abernathy should not speak in public about his

visions.

Confidential Informant T-l said that there

were two major decisions made by SCLC at this seminar:

1. The MLTP is too disorganized at this

point to conduct a nation-wide economic

boycott; however, by

this time next year

MLTP should be ready and probably the first

nation-wide economic boycott will have as

its target the A & P Food Chain Stores.

2. MLTP leaders in all major United States

cities have been instructed to qualify

their churches as

non-profit sponsoring

agents to secure United States Government

funds and build Government-financed housing

projects.

FION: EXECUTIVE COMA TIRE

National. Committee of inquiry

The national committee of inquiry hus embarked upon a program of in-

vestigation of the political scene in order to inform the black people

of this country of the political icalities that we face. Our investiga-

tion has not only carried us

into confcontations with the Presidential

aspirants bui di has carried us into a definitive investigation of the

political nachinery wich selects those aspirants. Though we have

given substantial attention to candidates on which subject you may expect

ouc findings on Saturday, we were grievously appalled by the facts

which relate to our political system.

We have found on the basis of the selection of delegates in both mojoi

parties that the political process is inherently undemooratic and un~

representative. It is in fact a mockery of representative government.

white millions of citizens watch the television scroens to withess

meaningless charados, no cameras piecce

the smoke filled rooms where

the chacecter of an administration

is actually determined, Not only

soas the oxisiting process deny white American people a

voice in its

pun governient. Jut it places a double

burden upon the black citizons

chis country becuse the political machinery like the

sociely of

hich it is a part is infested with cacism.

Black people therefore aro

rictimized twice by a corrupt process and

also a racist

witzin this context ve have concluded that there must be a confrontation

with the cxisting forces within the systen wich will give black

Americans

the political capacity to participate in the selection of

political

candidates instead of their mere election.

We are in the process not only of evaluaiing candidates and issues in

the interests of the black community but beyond that we intend to expose

the

structural defects of the political system.

our committee is but a beginning in a long process to chable black

America to exert its righuful influence in political. life. Our voice

will be militant and independent . our composition is diversified and

with those elements we will be able to speak honestly to every issue.

• In accordance with these investigations,

plenary session of the national

conmittee

will be meeting on Saturday in Chicago in an efcori to iñ-

plement a

strategy and complete ou findings.

National Committee of Inquiry

The nacional conmitice of inquiry has embarked upon a program of in-

vestigation of the political scene in order to inform the black people

of this country of the political rcalities that ve face. Our investiga-

tion has not only carried us into confrontations with the presidential

aspirants but it has carried us into a definitive investigation of the

political machinery which selects those aspirants. Though we have

given substantial attention to candidates on which subject you may expect

• 0Ue

findings on saturday, ve were griovously appalled by the facts

which relate to our political system.

•

• have found on the basis of the selection of delegates in both major

parties that the political process is inherently undemocratic and m

representative. It is in fact a

mockery of representative government.

Inite millions of citizens

watch the television screens to witness

meaningless charades, no cameras pierce the smoke filled rooms where

the character of an administration is actually determined. Not only

doas

the exisiting process deny unite American people a voice in its

own government but it places a double burden upon the black citizons of

this country because the political

machinery like the society of

mich it is a part is infested wich racism.

Black people therefore

rictimized twice by a corrupt process

and also a

racist one.

Within this context we have concluded that there must ise a confrontation

with the existing

forces within the systen wich will give black

Americans

the political

capacity to pacticipate in the selection of

political candidates

instead of their mere election.

We are in the process not only of evaluating candidates and issues in

the interests of the black community but beyond that we intend to expose

the structural defacts of the political system.

Our committee is but a beginning in a long process to enable black

America to exert its rightful influence in political. life. Our voice

will be militant and independent - our composition is diversified and

with these elements we will be able to spoak honestly to every issue.

• In accordance with these investigations, a plenary session of the naciona?

committee will be meeting on Saturday in Chicago in an affore to ii

plement a strategy and complete our findings.

washington, Do and there was supposed to be friction between

the two groups, however, no trouble materialized during the

course of the convention.

The leader of the "Chicago Rangers"

known as Baracuda, appeared to be in charge of security, at

least over the young Negroes, acting as a security force.

The security force was made up of the "Invaders"

from Memphis,

whose leader was known as "Sweet Daddy Wine". Source stated

tart we noted that in he evide the even thout

any question and no friction seemed to exist.

Source stated that Fred Bennett on the staff of the

SCLO from Atlanta, George, heads the security forces of SCLC

and is designated by them as a four star general. Baracuda

•is a two star general:

Reverend

members party.

report to the convention.

in thirty cities.

He condemned the Atlantic & Pacific (A&P)

chain of grocery stores.

He promised that SCLC would close down

the AsP chain all over the country and described them as the chain

selling the worst quality foods.

Reverend Abernathy was not

specific in how he proposed to attack the A&P stores other than

Source advised that at least ninety percent of the

people attending the convention were under twenty-five years

of age and were rather enthusiastic in receiving Reverend

Abernathy's talk.

Reverend Abernathy defined Black Power as

the use of the ballot box.

He stressed that the power of

Negro was in the ballot box.

Reverend Abernathy claimed that

the Poor People's Campaign was a success, first because it

made America conscious of the existance of poverty and

secondly,

because Congress is now doing someof the things

they said it could not do.

Reverend Abernathy stated that

soLe would call for a Nationa south conference, but he made

no mention. when it would be called, or where it would be

held.

• The source stated that the various panels held

during the day were uninteresting and for the. most.

consisted of speakers repeating the same thing over and over

again. On that evening the annual Freedom Banquet was held at

the Paradise Inn. The source stated that this was very poorly

organized and the food was poor and many people were not served

food. They were told that the money they paid for their dinner,

they should consider a donation to SCLC and that it was for a

good cause. Nothing new or unusual was said in speeches and

consisted for the most part in laments over the death of

Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Source stated that the mood

of the people appeared to be

King was now, dead and they should go

on from there and less should be said about . him. Mrs. King

spoke in generalities, without saying anything.

He stated that "Operation Breadbasket" would be established

in thirty cities.

He condemned the Atlantic & PaCiliC (Axi)

chain of grocery stores.

He promised that SCLC would close down

the A&P chain all over the country and described them as the chain

selling the worst quality foods.

Reverend Abernathy was not

specific in how he proposed to attack the A&P stores other than

stating that it would be in a non-violent way and that the way

Source advised that at least ninety percent of the

people attending the convention were under twenty-five years

of age and were rather enthusiastic in receiving Reverend

Abernathy's talk.

Reverend Abernathy defined Black Power

as

the use of the ballot box.

He stressed that the power of

Negro was in the ballot box. Reverend Abernathy claimed that

the Poor People's Campaign was a success, first because it

made America conscious of the existance of poverty and

secondly, because Congress is now doing someof the things

they said it could not do.

Reverend Abernathy stated that

SOLC would call for a National South Conference, but he made

• no mention

when it would be called, or where it would be

held.

• The source stated that the various panels held

during the day were uninteresting and for the most part

consisted of speakers repeating the same thing over and over

again. On that evening the annual Freedom Banquet was held at

the Paradise Inn. The source stated that this was very poorly

organized and the food was poor and many people were not served

food. They were told that the money they paid for their dinner,

they should consider a donation to SCLC and that it was for a

good cause. Nothing new or unusual was said in speeches and

consisted for the most part in laments over the death of

Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Source stated that the mood

of the people appeared to be

dead and they should go

on from there and less should be said about

• him.

Mrs. King

spoke in generalities, without saying anything.
