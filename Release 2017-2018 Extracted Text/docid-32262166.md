Dear Mr. Wolf:

As indicated in my letter of 21 September, additional Army records

in the case of Loran A. Hall have been located through the Veterans

Administration Headquarters in California. A certified copy of these

records is appended hereto as Attachment 1.

The documents provided do not constitute a complete service record,

since these were destroyed by the 1973 fire at the National Personnel

Records Center. However, the file contains substantial medical records

and substantiates military service by Mr. Hall as follows:

FINAL SUMMARY

PVT

22A/5.

11 Mar 47

White male, age 17,

with one motth military service, entered the

hospital relating that in 1941 after he had been in a hospital for fever,

he had fainted while in a formation while standing in the sun. He

denies any convulsions. Patient just passes out and comes to

minutes.

Later that same year, while standing at inspection for the

Civil Aeronautic Patrol, he just fainted.

He believes that he was very

weak from not having eaten dinner.

While in the army in a dayroom

ho was getting up out of a chair, hit is back against the arm of the

chair, felt a pain go up to his head and then just passed out.

Patient was admitted to the hospital.

Neurological examination of patient is completely negative. Patiert

appears somewhat immature.

Lumbar puncture, spinal fluid analysis,

X-ray of skull, glucose tolerance curve, and

other routine laboratory

tests were completoly normal.

We are unable to substantiate any diagnosis of epilopsy; however,

it is felt that this patient should be separated from the service with

the diagneess of syncope, cause undetermined.

Patient may be returned

to civilian life essentially in the same condition as on entrance in the

army. He will be discharged under Dragon 05-305.
