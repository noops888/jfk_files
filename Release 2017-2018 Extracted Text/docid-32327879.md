Re. NY tels 10/6,7/70, and report of SA PAUL J.

STAPLETON, NY, 9/23/70.

The following 1s

a resume of the events leading

up to and subsequent to the

gangland slaying of SALVATORE

GRANELLO, notorious soldier in the GENOVESE "family" of "LCN",

whose body was found 10/6/70.

NY 4336-CTE furnished information to the effect

that he was certain GRANELLO was slated to be "hit" because he

was "bad mouthing" TOMMY EBOLI and was making claims that he

intended to find out who was responsible for the assassination

of his son MICHAEL GRANELLO.

MICHAEL was killed in

gangland

fashion in NYC in December, 1968, when SALVATORE was confined to

the FCI, Danbury, Conn.

The contract on MICHAEL was let out after

he had a number of disputes with ICN members on the Lower East

Side of NYC.

MICHAEL GRANELLO was active with a younger hoodlum

group and had gained a reputation of being

guy".

Sources reported he was "hit" for a combination of reasons

and his utter disregard for ICN authority. At the time of MICHAEL's

death, sources reported SALVATORE was greatly upset and angered

over the killing and vowed that he would take retributive action

if he determined the identity of the slayers.

After SALVATORE GRANELLO's release from prison,

sources continued to report that he never forgave EBOLI for

authorizing the "hit" on his son..

SALVATORE GRANELLO was then

opened

as a PC of the NYO to explore the possibility of his

potential as a C-TE. On 9/23/70, GRANELLO was contacted by

Buagents for the purpose of informing him of the alleged "contract".

He initially declined to talk to the contacting agents and re-

quested permission to consult his attorney ROY COHN. After

telephoning COHN, GRANELLO told agents that his attorney instructed

him not to answer any questions pertaining to substantive matters

that were presently before the federal Court in the SDNY, but to act

in a cordial manner. Bureau should note that GRANELLO was under

indictment in three

separate cases in the SDNY alleging violations

of the WPPDA Statutes.

GRANELLO was then informed of the proposed contract

and the underworld rumors that he was slated to be

"hit" because

of his bad remarks about TOMMY EBOLI. GRANELLO discounted these

reports, claimed that he always got along with EBOLI and there was

no basis to the FBI's contention about the proposed hit.

Investigation revealed that on the evening of

about 7:00 p.m. and was to later meet LEVINE and CORALLO at the Park ~

Sheraton Hotel, NYC, about 11:00 p.m. He never made the meeting.

On 9/25/70, GRANELLO was scheduled to appear in

USDC, SDNY, with his attorney ROY COHN relative to an application

that he was making to the court for permission to travel to Florida.

GRANELLO never appeared but his presence was not needed as his

attorney filed the necessary. papers.

On 9/30/70, NY 4336-CTE advised that GRANELLO was

missing and that he was almost certain that he was hit.

On 10/1/70

, NY 7446 PC informed that he learned

GRANELLO was last seen 9/24/70, that he failed to appear in court

9/25/70, and failed to meet other appointments scheduled for 9/25/70.

Source reported GRANELLO's mother in Greenwood Lake,

upset over her son's disappearance and that GRANELLO's wife and

HYMAN GEORGE LEVINE came up from Miami to make inquiries about the

subject.

Source reported it was felt GRANELLO was possibly hit but

that relatives and close friends of GRANELLO were not discussing his

disappearance with any outsiders.

Subject's mother was contacted by a Buagent 10/2/70,

at Greenwad Lake, NY.

She admitted not having seen her son in a

couple of days but was not concerned because she assumed he was away

on business.

ments to be there with COHN.
