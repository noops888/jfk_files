WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 822-C advised that MAX EDER (MM 92-467) appears

to have acquired more control over activities at the

Fontainebleau Hotel, evidenced by the fact that executives

from all departments of the hotel have been consulting more

and more with EDER on policy, etc.

EDER now has JOE-SMITh,

• an employee of the baggage room of the Fontainebleau Hotel,

handling all of the employees!

with the money to BEN SHERMAN salets, which SMITH delivers,

a bookmaker for EDER.

also assigned BEN SHERMAN to operate in the cabana of the

hotel, rather than the card room, as EDER 1s attempting to

avoid paying the law enforcement

agencies.

Reportedly, EDER

then can report that there has been no activity in the card

room and hence there is no need to make any payoff.

MM 814-C reported that MIKE MC LANEY (MM 92-464)

had owed the Fontainebleau Hotel between $8,000 and $9,000

for three or four years, and recently paid 1t. He also

reportedithat MC LANEY acquired the transportation desk at

the Fontainebleau Hotel for $10,000 a year.

He advised in

odds at present because the transportation desk, In NOVACK's

opinion, has been doing very poorly.
