We have given all information developed to date to all

interested agencies and on 12/12/63 instructed Miami to see that U.s.

Bureau of Customs was fully apprised of all data developed since that

agency has been investigating Johnson and his activities on behalf of

the MIRR since last Summer, and is in position to seize any boat or

plane;which may be utilized in a raid over Cuba.

This afternoon Departmental Attorney John Davitt telephoned

and referred to the foregoing information. He said Department wants

to

prevent any raid over Cuba and

asked that we notify Bureau of Customs

of this fact, pointing out that a boat which the group plans to use in

transporting

munitions to the Bahamas for use of the raiding plane

should be, seized under Title 22, U.S. Code, Section 401, since the

exporting

of any

such munitions would be in violation of Title 22, U.S.

Code, Section 1934 (which is under Customs' investigative jurisdiction).

Davitt said Department is desirous of having the action stopped without

any arrests being made if

possible, but if necessary to stop the action,

arrests woüld be permissible.

He said the main concern here is to
