whose conviction and sentence are reported above,

and their sentence

grew out of another raid in which ARCADIA was apprahended, which raid

occurred on April 9, 1946, at 5714 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh. However,

ARCADIA was acquitted on

this charge after he and PERRINI both testifled

that ARCADIA had taken a lease on the premises only to acconnodate PERRINI.

1946, are presently engaged as commission brokers with

offices in downtown Pittsburgh.

They are in constant commmication with

FROY NATHAN, a big-time gambler who has his headquarters in the William Penni

Hotel. The value of this allignment is that upon information furnished by

JAFFE and FARBAR as to betting trends, NATHAN is able to make many coups.

The infornant further aavised that SAM MANTARINO, WILLIE SAM, and ART ROONEY,

who are mentioned on Pages 20, 21, 22, 43, 49, and 50 of the report subnitted

October 15, 1946, have all achieved the financial status of millionaires as

a result of their racket activities.

MANNARINO and SAM are located in New

Kensington, Pennsylvonia, and ART ROONEY 13 located on the North Side, Pitte-

burgh, Peinsylvania. The informant further advised that NAI IFFT, who 18

Agent INPORE then made discreet inquiries and determined that

restaurants, bar rooms, etc. in the Mckees Rocks district.

tender, his father-in-law, GRUENFIEID JIMMY SMITH, MILION JAFFU, a well-known

gambler and the brother of the owner of the only burlesque show in Pittsburgh;

and ARI ROONEY; the owner of the Pittsburgh. Steelers professional football tean.

All of the employees in the club were allegedly taken from the Bachelor's Club,

which was formerly

an exclusive gambling joint in Pittsburgh, leaving Ay TURNER

a former partner, in the Bachelor's Club; with only some bank and chuck-a-luck

games.

This grew out of a feud between TURNER and SMIIH, who are not on speaking

terme

at the present time:

It has been learned recently from Detective JOE

BECKER, who has served as CONY's bodyguard, that CON will shortly resume boxing

for financial reasons since CONV has gone broke in the horse racing game. \

On November 13, 1946, Confidential Informant|

advised that

HENRY CROWLEY; horse racing

news disseminator with headquarters in Steubenville,

Ohio, and RED MYERS,

whose first name was unknown to the informant,

are operating

a wire service in Pittsburgh as

a sideline to CROWLEY's other activities. Accord-

ing to the informant, the place in Pittsburgh caters to big bets only, taking

$1,000 as: ä minimum bet.

In an article appearing in the "Pittsburgh Press" written by feature

writer CHASTIR FOITER in January, 1947, POTTER stated that there are at least

slot nachines and other types of mechanized equipment for gambling in Alle-

County, Pennsylvania. He stated that a machine will pay for its own cost

within two or three weeks, after which each machine will average a $150 nét

income. "This figure does not include pinball machines, and if the estimate is

near accurate, the Federal Government is being defrauded out of approximately

hèlf a million dollars since such machines require a $100 license, According to

POTTER's article, the machines are manufactured by a Chicago firm, and by an

unwritten agreement the first $100 revenue therefrom is supposed to go to the

United States, Government for the license.

He stated that the distributing firm

for Western Pennsylvania "is owned or controlled by two Allegheny County men,

both widely known in political, police and sport circles." Thie undoubtedly

refers to ARI ROONEY,

owner of the: Pittsburgh Steelers national professional

football team, and BARNEY McGINLEY, his associate in sport enterprises, who

is also well known politically in Allegheny County.

The article suggested that

the best weapon against the machines, which predominantly appear in clubs having

liquor licenses, is by activities of agents of the State Liquor Control Board,

who do not need warrants to make inspections or corrections in such club premises.

Under the regulations governing the issuence of liquor, licenses to clubs, liquor

control agents are duty-oound to cite any club for disciplinary action if

gambling is found on

the premises, which citation could result in the suspension

or revocation of the liquor license issued to such club.:

The' article went on to

state that under existing Federal laws the Collector of Internal Revenue cannot

advise as to the number of $100 licenses issued since receipts from all coin

operated machines are lumped together, and these regulations forbid the Collector

from permitting perusal of the applications for

a license to count the number

relating to slot machines. The article stated that even police, fortified by

court order, are not permitted to see such applications.

In the "Fittsburgh Sun-Telegraph" issue of November 24, 1946, in an

article apparently written by DAVE JONES but bearing no by-line, it is stated

that the big time gambling joints and all other

types of rackets have been booming

in Pittsburgh since January, 1946, with at least a dozen new gambling joints

opening up in the firet ten nonths of 1946.

The article also pointed out that

during the same period Pittsburgh witnessed its first three racket slayings in

recent years and witnessed the open return of the old-fashioned slot machines.

On December 10, 1946, Confidential Informant

advised

that. former Chief of County Detectives JARPY, DEASY,

, TOMMY SILVERBLAIT, the

florist in the William Penn Hotel, and JOHN DUFFY, commonly, known as the "Wheeling

Kid," are'operating a high-stake card game on the seventh floor of the William

Penn Hotel regularly:

The informant also commented on the retirement of BILLY CONV, former

heavyweight boxing chempionship contender, as-follows:

BOB MATES, who is employed

at the Allegheny Sportsmen's Club, mentioned above, was at the training camp with

CONN prior to his bout with JOE LOUIS on June 19, 1946.

On the evening of the

fight, MATES telephoned from New York to ANTHONY "HOT NOSH" GAUTANO and advised

GARTAVO that MILION JAFTE, who has a percentage of CONY, had just bet $30,000 on

LOUIS and suggested that the smut money in Pittsburgh get on IOÜIS but that no

bets could be placed in New York because all bets had closed.

GARTANO, who had
