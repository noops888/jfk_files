Subjoct was asked 1f he know anyone by the name of

ognize as having perhapa some senificance to this individual.

After some mulling around he said he had heard of his own, I

did not suggest the name of Justo, he sugrested 1t bimself, he

mulled it around and he said he had heard of this Individual au

being a membor of an organization, he had never seen him, ha

does not know and he thinks that he 1s in the United States.

Subjeot claims no knowledge of this person at allo

Coument:

(De-Briefer'g

This latter Individual le now In one of our other safo

houses and claims to know this man very well and has seen him

many times.

It is not possible for this Individual to know

may subject to know Aguedo by any war name, because the man did

not use one until after he had gone into the Argentine Embasay.)

Bubject was also asked If he knew the name which was dreamed up

by myself.

Subjoot did not tumble, but tried to reason out who

It was.

He apparently was not trying to deceive me on this in-

dividual.

on one occasion in the Presedential Palace on the 13th of Maroh,

1960.

Subjeot olaims never to have spoken to them or treated with
