Memorandum to MI. Rosen

Re:, John Roselli

A Chicago source, CG 6343-C*, indicated that Lederer planned

to reside at Roselli's apartment at some future date and while in

Chicago Lederer was in contact with Murray Humphreys, a Chicago top

hoodlun.

Roselli and Lederer were determined to be in constant

contact with each other during late August and early September,

1960,

in Los Angeles.

On several occasions Lederer was known to depart

from Roselli's

home, proceed to an apparently prearranged rendezvous

and meet Roselli.

It was determined that during this period Rosell1

was apparently residing with a night club singer, Betsy Duncan, whose

identity was not previously known by los Angeles.

Roselli and Lederer were observed on one occasion during

September, 1960,

to be in contact with one Robert Notti, former

Assistant City Manager of Las Vegas, who was then in los Angeles,

Notti is employed as an investment expediter for H. L. Hunt, wealthy

Texas oilman.

Roselli was observed leaving the Los Angeles Airport on

9/2/60 for Las Vegas where he remained for a brief stay.

Lederer, on one occasion, was seen leaving subject's

apartment and departing in a car which was subsequently found to be

that of an informant of the Los Angeles Office. Additional information

about subject's activities has been obtained from this informant.

The

informant furnished information that subject, together with Lederer and

the subject's attorney, would fly from Los Angeles on that date.

Lederer and the attorney left for Las Vegas earlier that same day.

Financial Transactions

Los Angeles is currently examining bank records and other

financial transactions of Roselll. Checking accounts of Roselli's in

two Los Angeles banks are being examined and appropriate leads are

out to inquire further into transactions reflected in these accounts.

On 9/29/60 subject made out a check: in the amount of $400 to the

Diplomat Apartments.

It is noted the Diplomat is an apartment-hotel

in Las Vegas and the $400 payment is believed to be a months rental

on quarters that Roselli frequently maintains there. This is being

checked out.
