degree of accuracy, demonstrations, criminal acts which might be committed by

dissidents and others whose goals are inimical to our Government.

For the purpose of establishing this Interdepartmental Intelligence at

The Honorable J. Edgar Hoover

Director, Federal Bureau of

Investigation

Washington, D.C.

20530

Dear Mr. Hoover:

I sincerely enjoyed my conversation with you on

Wednesday and wish to thank you for so generously

giving me your time.

I have not contacted any of the departments and

agencies whose cooperation we hope to enlist in

connection with the government-wide intelligence

unit other thai your Bureau and the Central Intolli-

gence Agency. I think it would be helpful to have

your designee or designees named before making any

further contacts in order to have available your

advice with respect to which departments and agencies

should be included as well as those you deem unneces-

sary to include at this time.

In view of the fact that preliminarily, at least,

all we wish to do is discuss the subject very generally

for the purpose of assessing realistically the nature

and structure of the intelligence unit which we hope

to achieve, I am of the present opinion that the size

of the initial group should be somewhat limited.

I

would.be.grateful.for.your thoughts.on.this aspect of.

the problem as well as the substantive matters to be

resolved.

DATE: 12/1/70

The Director has instructed that Assistant Attorney ,

General Robert C. Mardian be advised that Inspector George C.

Moore will represent the Director in connection with meetings

which will take place with respect to a Government-wide

Intelligence unit being formed by Mr. Mardian. A

letter in

this regard is attached.

It is noted that in incoming letter from Mr. Mardian

dated November 27, 1970, Director -was requested to furnish

the identity nt his representative to the captioned unit and

was also requested to furnish his advice concerning other

departments and agencies which should be included in such

meetings. In this regard Mr. Mardian pointed out that he is of

the present opinion that the size should be somewhat limited.

In oux reply to Mr. Mardian we are pointing out that we are also

in agreement. that the size should be limited but will abide by

his decision regarding other agencies invited to participate.

It is not felt that we should be placed in a position of being

responsible for the make-up of any such group which might be formed.

Mr. Mardian also asked for the Director's thoughts

as to substantive matters to be resolved at such meetings.

It

appears that it is certainly premature at this point to make

any recommendations at all along this line, such will develop

out of the meetings

as they take place and vill be presented

to the Director for his decision in each instance.

Re: Intelligence Ivaluation Conmittee

Internal Security - Miscellaneous

It was indicated that they had been given the

assignment to expeditiously form a committee to have

access to all intelligence in the Government concerning

political terrorists in the United States in order to

render evaluations to Nessrs. Mitchell, Thrlichman, and

Haldeman who in-curn would advise the President. These

evaluations would be for the purpose of determining, but

necessarily limited to, such things as the severity of

the problem under study regarding various terroristic

groups and to make recommendations as to various options

which the President might take as to Federal response

concerning such problens. The responses which were

mentioned as exampies were legislation, pusecucion,

and other measures designed to alert and prevent acts

of terrorism.

It was apparent that both Dean and Mardian

had not given any real thought to mechanics of the

operation of this proposed committee as evidenced by

the fact that during the meeting Mardian called the

Attorney General direct in order to ascertain who would

pay Judge Sharp's salary and what office space he would

temporarily occupy. During the discussion with Attorney

General Mitchell, Mardian was told by the Attorney General

chat Sharp would

be funded by the Justice Department and

thạt the committee which was being formed was to be

considered as operating inder the Justice Department's

auspices; howevar, arrangements were being made for space

in Federal Office Building Number Seven which is near the

thing about its operation the response from Justice

would be that Justice Sharp was working with the

Department's Inter-Division Information Unit.

Mro liardian further informed that he had

purposely kept the initial meeting of the committee

small but felt that it should be enlarged to include

other Government agencies wich could make a con-

tribution and would have a definite interest in such

intelligence evaluations. In this regard, he stated

that the Accorney General was calling Secretary of

Defense Laird, Secretary of the Treasury Kennedy, and Vice

Admiral Noel A. M. Gayler of the National Security Agency

in order for them to have representatives at the next

meeting.

Mardian stressed that the President wanted

this committee

• set up as soon as possible in order

to become functional" and for that reason he intended

to call a meeting early next week, at which time other

matters such as staffing and procedural plans would be

formulated.

...

It was observed that Mr. "Märdian as well'as"

others present till rely largely on the Bureau for the

intelligence produce which vart be cumishea to this

committee for evaluation.

In this regard, Doherty of the

Justice Department commented that the FBI has furnished

No mention was made either as to the staffing

that they contemplated a small nucleus of personnel

working directly with Justice Sharp from the member

connection, the Justice Department has assigned Doherty

In this regard, Mr. Mardian stated that

following the initial meeting of the Connittee on 12/3/70 he

reported back to Attorney General Mitchell at which time

NI. Mitchell impressed upon Hardian the keen personal interest

of the President on a top priority basis in having the cap-

tioned Comnittee established and functioning in very short

order to an extent whereby the President can be assured of

getting.the very best intelligence available from all sources

within the Government in order to be in the best possible

position to decide action to be initiated and responses to

be made based upon such intelligence. Mardian stated that

either he (Mardian) or Attorney General Mitchell had spoken

personally with heads of the agencies represented on captioned

Comittee and had been assured their full cooperation.

Ke. Egit Kugh bivught up the security factoi enolved

and cautioned everyone present that the White House wanted to make

certain that everything is done to prevent any leakage to the

press that this particular Committee is in existence. It was

reiterated that if any such inquiry is made by the press, Justice

Sharp of Mr. Mardian would handle such by stating the Committee

was operating under the Justice Depariment in connection with the

operations of

the Inter-Divisional Information Unit (IDIU).

Mardian stated in fact this Committee has nothing whatever to

do with the IDIU but this response is for security cover purposes

only.

As the first step in carrying out the mission of the

Committee, each agency present was requested to submit a blind

memorandum (classified "For Eyes-Only) to nr. Pardian by the

close i business January a 19s containing a listing of

by the Cormittee in evaluating intelligence coverage of these

groups such ass the extent of foreign influence in each. of the

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANCOUS

This afternoon Judge Morell Sharp, Chairman of

captioned Committee on which I serve as the Director's

representative, called and stated that he would like to

advise me of a rather small problen which he realizes is

not within the FBI's jurisdiction but vanted to make it a

matter of record in our files.

The Judge stated that his Committee has just moved

into space in Federal Office Building i7 on Jackson Place and

this afternoon, around 1 p.M., a stranger very aggressively

cano to the coor and forcau lo wy in insising upue using

the telephone. He indicated his name was Dr. Sandler (phonetic)

who is interested in nuclear studies and he proceeded to nake

about four telephone calls looking for a Colonel John Sheffie

(phonetic) who was preparing sone sort of study in which Sandler

was very much interested.

Judge Sharp's secretary, Mrs. Dohaney, was the only

person in the room when this stranger came in and she stated

that she vas very much conceined about the security aspects

of the Committee in view of the fact that this individual.

seemed very inquisitive and nosey in trying to find out the

identity of the group currently occupying the space in that

particular room. It is noted that this space was previously

occupied by an executive study group which went by the name

of Aelantic-Pacific Interocean. Study Group which is no longer

in existence: Nirs. Dohaney described Dr. Sandler as approxi-

mately 6'1"' tall, age middle 40's, dark broim, long, curly

hairs slender build, long fingers,

aquiline nose, white race,

and well dressed.

Judge Sharp stated that he realizes that there is

nothing the FBI can do about this and, in fact, the stranger

was probably just seeking the free use of a Goverment tele-

phone by forcing his way

into the office space. Nevertheless,

the Judge is very security conscious and did not want something

like this to pass without the Bureau's knowing about. it.

At the sane White House meeting, 1/21/71, Mardian

that the committee oparate from a problem solving approach

and prepare necessary intelligence evaluation studies as

needed by the White House and operate within the framework

of agencies composing the committee without having an actual

working staff assembled within the committee itself. He said

he was promptly told by his superiors (Mitchell, thrlichman,

and Haldeman) that the President definitely wanted the

committee physically staffed and operational in short order

so that intelligence evaluations needed by. the White House

would be forthcoming. Both Dean and Mardian stated they were

taken to task for not having the committee physically staffed

antiwar demonstrations in Washington, D. C.; 2) Assessment

lof likelihood of campus disturbances in 1971; and 3) Develop-

ment of a calendar of proposed future extremist events.

It was indicated that the first item of importance,

however, was the physical staffing of a working group within

the committee composed of individuals from member

agencies

qualified to assist in analyzing and preparing appropriate

intelligence evaluations which in turn would be submitted

to the White House after appropriate review by heads of

Committee.

This intelligence evaluation working staff

togother with supporting cierical and stenogranhir personnel

is to be provided by agencies making up the captioned comnitiee

and is to function in a semipermanent capacity.

At this point I was asked by Mr. John Dean as

sto the FBI's position in helping to staff this group at

which time he was informed of our own manpower and

budgetary problems and frankly told that consequently

the FBI is not in a position to staff

the proposed working

group.

(In this regard advice of the Director was followed

as set forth on page three of my 1/11/71 memorandum, attached).

Both Mardian and Dean were quite insistent that I bring to

This is contrary to position which we have

taken in our letter dated 1/27/71 in which we stated that

we could not provide assistance in staffing a working group

because of manpower and budgetary problems.

Accordingly, it is felt that we should once again

point out our position in this regard and request that

"Staff" to clearly show that the proposed permanent

The stated functions of the permanent staff

appear to be in line with the committee's overall mission

and contain nothing which we should take issue with.

• RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached letter be sent to Assistant

Attorney General Robert C. Mardian requesting that the

wording of the "proposed charter" be changed to clearly

show the FBI will not provide personnel for the proposed

permanent intelligence estimation staff. The letter

reiterates our full support in providing intelligence to

inquiry received from the captioned Committee as to whether

the Bureau would desire to make a security "sweep" of the space

occupied by the Committee in the Internal Security Division of

the Department to make certain no listening devices are found.

This morning Mr. John F. Doherty, Executive Director

ot Che captioned Committee, contacted me and advised that the

space which will be occupied by the staff of the Intelligence

¡valuation Commiitee is aimost icady for occupancy. This space

is located on the 4th floor of the sane building in which the

Domestic Intelligence Division is located (9th and D Streets,

Northwest) and is part of the overall space occupied by the

lInternal Security Division of the Depariment. Mr. Doherty

stated that since much of the information which will come into

the hands of the Committee will be in the nature of communica-

tions intelligence data which bears the highest security

classilication and security protection, it will be necessary

to give the space a thorough security "sweep" both physically

and electronically..

Mr. Doherty stated that he is able to obtain the

services of other members of the Committee (Defense Intelligence

Agency, National Security Agericy, and Central Intelligence Agency

to handle this security check hit he did not vant to do so without

DATE: 2/22/71

ON : R. D. Cotter

BJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Mr. G. C. Moore's memorandum, 2/19/71, reported T

that the Executive

Director of captioned Committee had

furnished three intelligence estimates, prepared by the

Committee for Bureau comments.

Mr. Moore is to discuss the

documents at the next meeting of the Committee.

=1.

"May 1971 Demonstrations."

The first estimate

is entitled

"May I9TI Demonstrations" and concludes that-it is

too early to prodict the size of the demonstratiors scheduled

for Washington, D. C.,

the first week in May.

As previously

reported, these demonstrations

are being sponsored by the

Peoples

Coalition for Peace and Justice.

Some officials

vi the Conlition, particularly kenne Davis, idve veeu

calling for a shutdown of Washington, D. C., on one day of

the demonstrations, probably May 5.

The Committee's conclusions

state that the Coalition has publicly announced the intent to

block the flow of traffic into Washington, D. C., the Pentagon,

and the Central Intelligence Agency.

Observations

---

We agree that it is too early to predict the size

of the demonstrations scheduled for May 197l. We also agree

that vandalism may take place during the demonstrations.

It

should be noted, however, that during a meeting of the Coalition's

Continuation Committee last January, members of the Committee

voted against disrupting the flow of traffic into Washington, D. C..

However, extremists among the demonstrators could still attempt

to do this inasmuch as Davis has given considerable publicity

to this plan.

n 2. restimate of bikelihood of Nev. Momentum on the

"(Antivar Activittes and Forces in View of therlaos and. Cambodian

ISituation." This estinate, captioned as above, concludes

that

military action in Laos or Cambodia will give new impetus,

purpose

and unity to the antiwar Movement and the protest

activities will be stimulated.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

Observations

We concur with this conclusion. It should be noted

that antivar demonstrations have increased measurably since

the military action began in Laos.

For example, on 2/10

¡demonstrations were held in over 60 cities throughout the

United States. It should be noted that in Les background

information on this conclusion, the Committee mentions che

"National Student Movemont" in connection with the recent

Student Mobilization Committee antivar conference at Catholic

University.

The way this is written leaves the impression

that there

is an organized group called the National Student

Movement which is, of course, inaccurate.

3. "Likelihood of Kidnaning of Any High U.s• Govern-

ment Official in the Inmediate Future by Political Terrorists.

This estinate, cantioned as above,

e, concludes my sanapies 5t

a high government official must be considered a definite probam

bility by extremist elements.

Observations

We concur with this conclusion. It should be noted

that the background material submitted by the Committee

supporting this conclusion states that violence-prone groups

such as the Black Panther Party and the Weatherman have endorsed

political kidnaping.

We do not have information that the

Weatherman has endorsed kidnapings although it has called for

assassinations for political purposes.

ACTION:

If you approve. Inspector G.. C.. Moore, who represents

the Bureau on the Intelligence Evaluation Conmittee, vill make

RE: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

62-113887

The Committee staff is preparing guidelines which will be

issued to each of the agencies making up the Committee in

order to have individual draft estimates prepared. (Upon

receipt, the request will be analyzed and submitted for

lapproval prior to our undertaking preparation of estimate).

Mr. Mardian expressed his concern over the fact that

the staff of the Committee is not large enough to prepare the

intelligence estimates needed to carry out the mission of the

Committee.

In this regard he stated he is in receipt of a

letter from the Department of Defense indicating that since the

FBI is not furnishing personnel to the Committee's working

group, Department of Defense also will be unable to furnish

personnel in the future.

Mr. Mardian stated that this leaves

the working staff composed merely of representatives from

the Internal Security Division of the Department, Secret

Service, National Security Agency and the Centrai Intelligence

Agency.

He expressed the hope that something could be done

in the near future to fully staff this group in view of the

obvious increased activity on the part of militant groups and

individuals in the country.

ROM :R. D. Cotter pRem

SUBJECT: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

By letter dated 3/10/11, attached, the Intelligenco,

Evaluation Committee (IEC) furnished two estimates drawn up

by the Committee.

The first concerns the demonstrations

scheduled to be held at Washington, D.C., 4/24/71 to 5/5/71.

The second is a Calendar of Events (demonstrations) going

through 5/5/71.

Bureau comments or approval of the estimates is

requested by 3/12/71. Telephonic approval was requested.

The estimate concerning the pending demonstrations

at Hashington conciudos that it is too carly to pecaici ibe

size of these demonstrations. (This is an accurate conclusion

as planning for these demonstrations is still taking place.)

It also concludes that the demonstration on 4/24/71 will

probably reduce participation

in subsequent demonstrations

las participants will not remain in Washington until 5/5/71.

(This is also a valid conclusion.

April 24 has been set for

the date of the massive demonstration by both the National

Peace Action Coalition and the People's Coalition for Peace

and Justice, the sponsors of it.)

It is also concluded that

these demonstrations will be similar to past major demon-

strations.

It points out that during the past demonstrations,

a small number of participants have engaged in vandalism and

other destructive acts.

It also points out that the People's

Coalition for Peace and Justice has

indicated that nonviolent

civil disobedience will take place.

(As of the date of the

estimate, 3/9/71; this: is a valid conclusion.

There will,

undaibtedly, be civil disobedience

and acts. of vandalism

during these

e demonstrations.

April - May Demonstrations, April 5, 1971, " also attached, prepared by

the Intelligence Evaluation Committee.

I have read the entire estimate and find it a concise and

informative statement of what may be expected both at home and abroad

in connection with the forthcoming April and May demonstrations. The

information appears to be correct insofar as can be judged by that which

has previously come to my aitention. It is true, as the Domestic

Intelligencs Divicion cheerves, that the number of participants and the

extent of civil disobedience are still tentative, but that seems unavoidable

at this time because the organizing groups are still in the planning stage.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Bureau offer no objection to this estimate.

COMMITTEE (IEC)

**,

Captioned Committee has furnished an estimate drawn

up

by it concerning the forthcoming demonstrations at lashington,

D. C.,

beginning 4/24/71.

The estimate states that it will

be distributed by the Committee unless members of the IC,

of which the Bureau is one, object.

The estimate concludes that it is extremely difficult

to adequately predict the size of the April 24, 1971 demon

strations, bui indications are that attendance will be over

100, 000.

It also concludes that strong efforts are being made

by groups tavoring aisrupon io raily sirruit dur tuc ovents

scheduled April 25 - Max 5; extensive disruption has been

planned by some factions which are likely to be beyond the

control of the organizers'

• Leadership.

It announces that

disruptions will include blocking of key bridges and major

traffic arteries; sit-ins and interference with the work of

Government employees, as

well as the possibility of "knocking

out" the

telephone system, having Radio Hanoi announce a

state of insurrection and martial law in Washington, D.C.,

and

the cutting of all pover sources in the Capital.

The estimate

"notes that a spokesman for People's Coalition for Peace and

Justice (PCPJ) has indicated it will take Federal troops to

prevent use of hock Creek Park as a campsite.

A major

conclusion in the estimate is that the key to the extent and

tone of the April - May demonstration lies in the response

of students to the proposal that they be prepared to stay

in Washington for at least a week.

At present, there is

insufficient information on which to judge the extent of

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Director has approved assignment of two qualifiet,

Special Agents and one secretary to the permanent working

staff of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC) pursuant

to a request from the Attorney General.

Inspector George C. Moore discussed with the Executive

Director of the Committee today methods and standards of the

operation of the Committee staff.

The staff reviews a voluminous

amount of intelligence data received from the intelligence

community, does research, and prepares estimates for dissemina-

tion to the White House and other high officials within the

I Executive Branch. What the Committee needs are Bureau personnel

who are well livined regarding entremist arbyteres across-the-

board in the dömestic field, Bureau coverage and resources

regarding violent demonstrations and agitation in antivar and

racial fields, and especially personnel who have expertise in

analysis and

research.

It is felt that the following Agents would be ideally

suited to handle this assignment and would be well qualified not

only for Committee purposes but to protect the Bureau's best

interests: 1) Section Chief Richard D. Cotter of Research Section,

Domestic Intelligence Division; and 2) Supervisor Garnett I. Tunstall,

Racial Intelligence Section, Domestic Intelligence Division.

Section Chief Cotter has had 23 years of service as an

Agent and has handled Section Chief's: position in Domestic Intelli

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

RE: STAFF. SUPPORT - INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

a wealth of experience in research matters and his Section has

been coordinating

the intelligence gathering functions with

respect to extremist groups.

It is noted that staff members

from other agencies represented on the Committee are in grades

GS-15 to GS-17 and it is believed an individual of similar

stature should represent the Bureau.

It is noted that Cotter

suffered a heart attack in September, 1970, and is currently

on limited duty. However, he has made a good recovery from

this coronary, is now working on a full-time basis, and there

lis no reason why he cannot handle this Committee.

Also, if the Director so desires, Cotter will be in a

position to assume the increasing administrative liaison functions

between the Committee staff and the Bureau, which would relieve

Inspector George C. Moore of these duties currently being

handled by him. Inspector More, of course, would still be the

Director's representative on the IC itself (distinguished from

the working staff).

The IC staff is located in the same building as

Domestic Intelligence Division and accordingly Section Chief

Cotter will be able to stay in close touch with the operations

of his Section.

...

With regard to Supervisor Tunstall, he has been an

Agent for some 24 years, including the last three years at the

Seat of Government in Racial Intelligence Section where he is

presently serving as GS-14.

Tunstall has a wealth of experience

In security and Intelligence work, especially in the all important

• INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

SUBJECT: INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

To recommend that the attached letter and enclosures

be furnished to Mr. John E. Doherty, Executive Director of the EC.

As you have been previously advised by memorandum of

R. D. Cotter to C. D. Brennan, 6/24/71, same title, Mr. Doherty

requested information we have on the subject of "The

Interrelationship of Arab Terrorist Groups and U.S. Black

Militants." The IEC with the concurrence of the White House is

scheduling an intelligence estimate on that subject.

American black extremists have established a close

relaiionship with Arab cerrurisi groups; much anti-Semitic and

anti-Zionist propaganda has appeared in the black extremist press

and complete support of the Palestinian "liberation struggle" has

been expressed by black extremists in this country.

Two groups containing black extremists and/or subversives

have traveled to the Middle East in the past year. The groups

ostensibly were to observe the situation and return to the U.S.

to propagandize on behalf of the Arabs but both reportedly visited

Arab guerrilla camps and one group was trained in the use of

handguns, rifles, and explosives. One member of this latter group

emble of

claimed members of that group were expected to commit acts of

terrorism when they returned to this country. Others of the

group have denied receiving such instruction but members of this

group have engaged in firearms training upon their return to this

country. Both groups have engaged in propaganda efforts on behalf

of the Arabs

reigny

No information has been received to date to indicate

that any members of the two groups who visited the Middle East

have engaged in terrorist activities in the U.s.

• Meeting of-the Committee took place this morning,

Assistant Attorney General Mardian acted as Chairman, and

the following representatives were present:

of Central Intelligence Agency; Martin Pollmer and Robert

Merchant of Treasury;

of National Security

Agency: Tom Kelley and Dan Miller of Secret Service; Colonel

John Downie and Bill Vaught of Defense Department; Jim McGrath

ut Intoinul Security Divicion; and John Dohortz, rocutive

Director of IC.

I represented the Bureau.

Mr. Mardian stated that he had just returned fxom

seeing the President in San Clemente and that, as a result

of his visit with Mr. Nixon, he was charging the IC with a

new project; namely,

a comprehensive report on the United

states Government's treatment of classified and sensitive

information along with such corollary problems as how "Top

secret

clearances are granted, whether we need to tighten

up our security procedures, and whether there is too much

classification of documents under our current system. Mardian

noted that this study was triggered by the Ellsberg case but

he was not asking the Committee to review the Ellsberg investi

gation as such.

He said that President Nixon was most concerned

regarding. the Pentagon Papers incident and the serious situation

cheated by supreme court decisions relating to the fasterg

case.

Mardian. said that the: fresident wanted the. Committee

to conduct an overall, comprehensive review of all the factors

relating to classification and profection of national defense-

information and to make appropriate recommendations for the,

President's consideration

Memorandum R. D. Cotter to MC. C. D. Brennan

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

Mardian reviewed briefly the various ongoing studies

which are already underway by other agencies relating to this

general matter. These include a study being made by Assistant

Attorney General Rehnquist regarding classification and de-

classification procedures (pursuant to National Security Council

(Directive 117 of January, 1971); a Department of Defense damage

estimate dealing with the Ellsberg and related disclosures; a

Defense Department study on security management and clearances

at the Rand Corporation; and a Defense Department review of

the origin and development of the entire "McNamara Study" on

which the so-called Pentagon Papers were based. Mardian said

that the result of all these studies would be funneled to the

IEC on a continuing basis and that the committee would llave

access to any other information it might need from any component

of the Executive Branch.

Mardian also pointed out that several Congressional

investigations will be conducted concerning the Pentagon Papers

and related developments. He said that one in particular, by

the House Armed Services Committee, will be a penetrative

study

and will have the full cooperation of the Executive Branch.

He asked that this information be closely held. Mardian said

that an exact definition of the objectives of the IC in

connection with this study should be worked out by the Committee

Staff in the near future in line with the capabilities of the

Committee. He again stressed that anything the Committee needs

from any agency will be made available, if necessary through

White House intercession; and that the IC study will be a

holds barred" review.

an example of this, Mardian noted that the

Committee should look into the question of former Presidents

taking highly classified material with them when they leave

office.

In answer to a question, Mardian said that no

deadline could be placed on the Committee's study. He

noted that it would depend in large measure on the Committee's

receipt of input from current reviews being made by Defense

Department and Justice. Mardian said that he was well aware

this job is a complex and difficult one but stressed that he

felt that it could be of great value to the White House and

the Executive Branch generally and that this study alone

could prove the need and value of the IEC.

Memorandum R. D.

Cotter to Mr. C. D. Brennan

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

It was agreed that special attention should be

devoted to the possibilities of unauthorized disclosure

of classified information being made through the dissem-

¡ination and handling of such data by non-Government

agencies especially private contractors or subcontractors

who are granted access to sensitive data in connection

with Government projects.

The IEC will focus particularly

on such contractors who deal in study projects and policy

matters such as the Rand Corporation and similar "think

tanks." As a matter of fact the starting point for the

IEC will be an examination of the Government's relation-

ship to Rand and a review of policies and practices of

Rand in handling classified information and granting

access to it. (In this connection IEC will obtain copies

of ongoing studies currently being conducted by Defense

Department.) From there the IEC study will branch out

to cover similar private organizations with access to

Classified information, with the objective of recommenà-

ing specific measures to tighten security gaps and fore

stall a recurrence of the Ellsberg fiasco.

For information. You will be kept advised of

any significant developments.

This memorandum recommends that Section Chief!

Richard D. Cotter who has been serving on the working

staff of captioned Committee since 6/1/71 be designated

to replace Inspector George C. Moore as the Bureau's

representative on the Committee itself.

When this Committee was first set up in late

1970, the Director designated Inspector Moore as the

Bureau's

representative.

Subsequently, in response to

a specific request by the Attorney General, the Director

approved assignment to the Commitice's workiny siaff of

two Bureau representatives including

Section Chief Cotter.

Since his assignment to the IEC staff, Cotter

has devoted a great majority of his time to this assign

ment. As reported in previous memoranda, the IEC has

been requested by the white House to consider various

aspects of security leaks typified by the Ellsberg case.

The IEC will play a major role in drawing together and

correlating the various studies which have been under-

taken by different agencies as an outgrowth of the

"Pentagon Papers" disclosures. Moreover, the Committee

will now be reporting directly to a White House repre

Reference prior memoranda advising that the Intelligence

a summary regarding the problem of unauthorized disclosures of classified

information together with appropriate recommendations.

For your information, a meeting of the working staff of the

IEC was held on the afternoon of 8/12/71 at which time a tentative outline

was drawn up to define the specific areas into which the ILC will inquire.

It was decided that the principal aim of the IEC reDori, viu be io deveion

recommendations as to (1) whether dissemination of classified information

should be more restrictive than under current practices and (2) whether

additional steps are needed to insure the reliability and trustworthiness of

individuals who hold access.

The IEC study will concentrate on questions involving personnel

security and access rather than with matters relating to physical security

or administrative handling of files, mail,_etc. It will show the great

complexity and magnitude of the problem of properly controling classified

information without resorting to undemocratic methods. The study will

focus on the problems arising from the disclosure of classified data to

individuals and firms outside the Executive Branch under various industrial

and scientific contracts. We will particularly take a close look at the

Rand Corporation and other think'type.groups.m:

The TEC also plans to cover in general terms problems arising:

rom leaks to the press.

The report will emphasize the difficulties encountered

in identifying persons responsible for such leaks and in prosecuting them.

It will stress the fact that the only real answer to

such leaks lies in tight

administrative controls and discipline within each Federal agency, a positior

events at Attica State Prison. The White House is

interested in the scope of the problem posed by prison

riots as well as the influences which create these

conditions in the penal system. Of particular interest

lIs the influence of black and New Left extremists in

prison disorders.

According to Mr. Wells, 10/15/71 has been

set as the deadline for this estimate and all member

agencies of IEC are being requested to. furnish anv

pertinent data they may pogsess;

The Bureau has previously levied a requirement

on the field to furnish data developed regarding the

extremist activity directed against prisons and the

field has been instructed to submit such data in form

suitable for dissemination by 10/1/71. Upon receipt

information, including appropriate recommendations.

Attached is a draft. of the proposed report on

this subject which has been prepaced by the staff of the

In summary, this report outlines the major problems

and policies which relate to this matter; summarizes the

pertinent executive orders and directives relating io this

issue and comments on their effectiveness; sets forth the

major lessons learned from the "Pentagon Papers" fiasco;

and lists specific recommendations to tighten Government

security and better protect classified data.

Recommendations include a conclusion that all

agencies should have centralized control of releases

involving classified data and that such releases should

first be cleared by appropriate intelligence or security

personnel to assure that it is sanitized. Recommendation

was also made that contacts with news media should be

tightly controlled with clearly defined procedures and a

central office to handle press

contacts.

In addition, a

recommendation was made that;all contacts with news media;

should be undertaken by the agency involved. It has always

been the Bureau's position that the ultimate answer to

leaks lies in tight administrative control and internal

discipline within the various agencies.

The report also calls for improved security

training and orientation programs both within the Government

and private industries handling classified material and

for tougher security inspections. This report specifically

deplores the practices of some Government officials retaining

classified documents as "private papers" and urges that an

executive directive be issued prohibiting this practice.

Fxom the above, it can be seen that in large

measure this report reflects views long held by the

Director and recommends practices which already are fol-

lowed by the FBI..

- It is believed this report is an excellent

• statement of the problem of unauthorized disclosures and

that it contains a number of hard-hitting and effective

recommendations to improve the situation. The IEC staff

is to take up this report at a meeting on 10/26/71. At

that time, member agencies will submit any suggested

corrections or modifications.

ACTION:

If you approve, Bureau representatives will offer

no objection to this report at the 10/26 meeting. You will

"INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

By memorandum, R. D. Cotter to Mr. E. S. Miller, dated 1l/5/7i, the

Laboratory was requested to submit observations on any national security hazards

posed by "phone phreaking," the use of telephone lines by private individuals who

are familiar with various signalling systems employed by the telephone company.

Reference memorandum was precipitated by an article in the October, 1971, issue

of Esquire magazine by Ron Rosenbaum, captioned "Secrets of the Little Blue Box."

The term "blue box" is applied to a tone signalling device which

generates tones normally used by toll operators and telephone switching equipment to

initiate and dial long distance calls within the telephone direct distance dialing network

(DDD). The Laboratory has been familiar with "blue boxes" for many years. A

numbi mg marg b maamde? in the Laboratory.

"Phone phreaks" are individuals who are either technically competent to build a

"blue box" or have obtained one from some source and who amuse themselves by

using the "blue box'' to make toll-free calls within the DDD network. Some "blue

boxes"' are known to have been used by gamblers to make toll-free calls that

normally produce no record of the call to telephone company billing equipment. In

a recent Title III court-authorized wiretap in Las Vegas, interceptions were made of

a "blue box"' so used.

The Laboratory is of the opinion that "blue boxes" do not pose any

substantial national security threat to telephone communications. A "blue box" could

be used to initiate a single long distance call thereby tying up a single calling path,

but it is not felt likely that a sufficient number of "blue boxes" could be operated

independently to tie up enough single channels to materially effect the toll network.

could be a simple method of wiretapping.

Various defense telephone networks which are accessible by DDD have

While the Laboratory does not have information on many computer

systems accessible by telephone dialing, such systems as NCIC, which is the center

of a dedicated network, appear to have adequate safe guards to prevent unauthorized

would like to get monthly reports on the Republican Convention

in San Diego, 8/21-24/72, and the Democratic Convention in

Miami Beach, 7/10-13/72. Beginning about May, the White House

desires biweekly reports and reports on a weekly basis beginning

about 7/1/72. Mr. Dean told Wells that the White House would

expect the IC to serve as a focal point for pertinent infor-

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

On the local scene, the San Diego Convention

Coalition is beset with serious internal problems, and

the Community Congress of San Diego has announced estab-

lishment of a group to provide for medical, legal, housing

and other aid for the demonstrators. Unsubstantiated

information indicates dissident elements have formed

battle plans for rioting and accelerated violence,

including bombing; however, these reports appear to be

only grandiose schemes of individuals who do not have

sufficient backing to accomplish substantial disturbances.

On the international scene, the San Diego

Convention Coalition has received a letter of support from

the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the American

People, a quasi-official organization of the North

Vietnamese Government.

General law enforcement task force continues to

hold meetings, but in view of possible change of location,

San Diego Police Department is holding further plans for

• the Convention in abeyance.

Mr. Bernard A. Wells, Executive Director, IEC, has

advised that the White House has expressed an interest in

being advised of the plans and the disturbance potential of

(demonstrations scheduled for May 27 for Washington, D. C.

These demonstrations are in protest to the U.S.

support of European colonialist rule in Southern Africa,

including present situation in Rhodesia. They are sponsored

by the African Liberation Day Coordinating Committee, a group

composed of pan-African organizations and the Congress of

African Peoples. Individuals involved in these denunstrations

are expected to range from the most militant to high-level.

civil rights leaders.

They are expected to draw support from

all levels of the black community and could easily involve

violence.

In view of the violence potential of the above

demonstrations, the IEC, in accordance with the White House

request, is obtaining all available information concerning

the plans for these demonstrations from the member agencies

of IEC. Information developed by the Bureau will be furnished

to IEC by the Bureau's representatives and will be included in

the overall reports submitted to the White House.

to observe that the Miami anti-Castro Cubans present a pos-

The White House has requested an evaluation be

prepared by IC setting out the plans and disturbance poten-

tial of the May 27, 1972, African Liberation Day demonstra-

tion in Washington, D. C. By memorandum dated 5-8-72, approval.

was received for Bureau representatives on the IC to furnish

the Committee information concerning this demonstration.

Attached is the initial IFC report in which the

disiuvaice potontil of tis demonstration is mted ao high

in view of the extremist individuals and organizations involved

in its planning. The Committee feels that although the

demonstration may not reach the attendance figure of 10,000

as predicted by its leaders, there will be sufficient numbers

to present a potential for violence.

Led by such individuals as Leroi Jones; Howard Fullegn

and extremist leaders of the Black Panther Party and the

Republic of New Africa, and focused against such targets as

the South African, Rhodesian and Portuguese Embassies, the

individual participants could easily be incited to commit acts

of destruction, as well as confrontation with law enforcement

officers.

An additional evaluation will be submitted prior

to the demonstration when a check of transportation sources ind

winn give a more realistic indication as to the number of

participants coming from outside the City.

• Attached is a copy of the latest IEC report dated

National Convention scheduled for Miami Beach, Florida, in

August, 1972. This report points out that organizations are

beginning to form which are focusing their attention on the

Miami Beach site for the Republican Convention. Leaders of

groups formerly planning demonstrations at the San Diego

site are now joining with East Coast groups and are in the.

process of forming the Miami Conventions Coalition (MCC) to

his militant Anti-war Union to peaceful demonstrations.

SUBJECT: STAFF SUPPORT -- INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

During May, 1971, former Attorney General Mitchell requested

that Bureau assign two qualified Agents and one secretary to permanent

working staff of Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC). This

Committee is composed of representatives of Justice, Bureau, Central

Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Secret Service, Defense '

Department and Treasury Department and it prepares reports and

estimates, primarily regarding possible civil disorders for the

White House and the Attorney General.

In response to Attorney General Mitchell's request, two Agents

were assigned full time to IEC in May, 1971 (Section Chief R. D. Cotter

and Supervisor G. T. Tunstall). Cotter has recently been appointed to

: the newly created post of Bureau's Document Classification Officer to

carry out implementation of the new classification and declassification

procedures.

It is believed SA Tunstall can at this time handle the Bureau's

representation to IEC alone; however, we should advise the Attorney

' General of our recall of one representative from IEC.

Attached for approval is appropriate letter to Attorney General

in this connection.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee

The attached report concludes that the demonstra-

tions during the Democratic National Convention will not

attract large numbers of participants and will, in all

likelihood, be peaceful and nonviolent. The greatest

potential for violence lies with the Cuban refugee groups

and their actions against protesters.

The IEC report contains information compiled from

contributions

from the various Government agencies, including

a large volume of information made available by the Bureau.

Al1 Bureau information incorporated therein has previously

been disseminated to interested agencies, including the IEC.

17-14-72 regarding potential disruptions at the Republican

National Convention scheduled for August 21-24, 1972, in *

Miami Beach, Florida. This report predicts that the lack of

suaress of protest astivitios during the Democratic National

Convention will affect such activities during the Republican

National Convention. The number of participants are expected

to be greater and the violence potential higher due to oppo-

sition to current Vietnam policies and to the general anti-

establishment sentiment among the protesters.

The two coalitions in operation just prior to the

Democratic National Convention, the Joint People's Action

Coalition and the Miami Conventions Coalition, are expected

to continue coordination of protest activities for the

Republican National Convention. The Vietnam Veterans Against

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

INTERNAL SECURITY - MISCELLANEOUS

(IEC

IEC,

formed in late 1970 at the specific instructions

of President Nixon, is composed of representatives of the

various U. S. intelligence agencies.

The Committee, although

housed in the Department of Justice space under the direction

of an executive director who is a special assistant to the

Attorney General, is directly responsible to The White House.

Its purpose is to review and evaluate all data collected by

the

U. S. intelligence community

and to submit results of such

evaluations to The White House.

Participating agencies,

Including the Bureau, are represented on the working staff.

On March 21, 1972, the President's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board (FIAB), in furtherance of the President's

announced reorganization of U.S. intelligence efforts requested

IEC to obtain from the various agencies and furnish to FIAB an

overall list of the intelligence requirements of the U. S.

intelligence community which could be collected domestically.

FIAB requested such list in connection with their study of

ways and means to improve the quality of intelligence within

the limitations of recent budgetary and other resource con

straints imposed upon the nverallU. S. intellidence effort.

e na..

Attached is a rough drait of a proad, comprenensive

list of intelligence requirements compiled by the IC staff

from contributions of member

agencies in accordance

with the

EIAR reguest.

As pointed out in the introduction, intelligence

can no longer be

defined in the classic: context whioh

concerned itself with information regarding foreign governments insure

their.activities/capabilities; military prowess.and. foreign

Porcles. Such a definition in today's environment is much A4

too limited:

Intelligence requirements of the U. S.have +

broadened and proliferated immensely and, although the old

techniques and methods of collection are still valuable, new? tor

ones may have to be adopted with increased emphasis on

exploitation of available sources within the

United States

Although basicaily this is

not a new concept, it has not been

fully emphasized or implemented in the past.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

This report, which will be disseminated only to The

White House with copies to the lec member agencies, contains

observations which coincide with the already formulated

attitude of the FIAB which is interested in and nurturing

broader across-the-board intelligence collection efforts.

The

thrust being put forth is human

collection versus mechanical

collection.

In other words it is being realized that the

u. S. has been putting too many

expense of what is thought to be by many in the intelligence

community a better and more economical means of intelligence

The President in his plans for reorganization of

intelligence efforts does not desire a cut in intelligence

gathering but rather the replacement of costly collection

methods with more economical and thorough means.

If this theory is sustained and the President

endorses it, the FBI will be the logical agency to handle the

job because of our present responsibility of intelligence

collecting within the United States.

If this occurs and

since our duties would be substantially broadened, additional

manpower and resources will be needea.

ACTION:

If approved, the bureau's representative on the IEC

staff will concur with these requirements for submission to

the FIAB.

ADDENDUM BY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR E. S. MILLER 10/4/72 ISM:aeb

I can endorse the observations made by Nr. Tunstall in

this memorandum since ve are currently.in the process: of preparing..

answers to 36 questions submitted by the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board, a number of which are obviously

"directed" to what appears to be a/preordained concept.of./expanded

Of particular interest is the reporting of plans

The White House requested IEC prepare an evaluation

of the potential of foreign students (Arab, Israeli and Irish)

in the U.S. for conducting or aiding terrorist activities in

this country. Prior memorandum of 11/10/72 attached a copy

of a summary of information compiled by the Bureau for use

in the above evaluation. This data was approved by the Actina

Director on 12/5/72.

Attached is the Bureau's copy of IEC Estimate Number 30

entitled "Porcign Deudcuts -Terrorists, dated siclis. this

estimate concludes that the large number of Arab students in

this country present a definite potential for either aiding

Fedayeen terrorist groups in local operations or actually

participating in terrorist activities. Control of Organization

of Arab Students by militant Arabs increases the potential

for the use of this organization by terrorists. It is felt

that diplomatic missions, which have been a channel for arms

and

financial support for terrorists in other countries,

could provide the means for such activities in this country.

This estimate fürther comments that as tensions

increase between Arabs and the Israelis and as Arab terrorist

activities increase worldwide, it becomes more possible that

Arab students in this country will engage. or assist ip such

activities.

Although no information of this nature is yet..

ravatlable, Fedayeen terrorists may be introduced into the N-t.

inger the guise of students.

The estimate further concludes that information is

so limited on Greek, Irish, Israeli, Spanish, Yugoslav and other

students that it is not possible to make an evaluation of their

potential danger as a source of terrorism or disruptive activities

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

"New York Times'" today carries lead story captioned

White House Ring Reportedly Spied on Radicals in '70."

This article, written by Seymour Hersh, deals chiefly with

history and activities of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee

(IEC), an interagency group which was formed at the direction

of the White House in late 1970 and which has been furnishing

general intelligence reports to the White House since that date.

The Committee is made up of representatives of the FBI, Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Department

of Defense, Secret Service, Treasury Department and Justice Department.

While the "Times" article contains elements of fact, it presents

a badly distorted version of the objectives and operations of the IEC.

This memorandum summarizes the "Times" allegations and sets

out the actual facts for the information of the Acting Director.

"New York Times" Charges

According to Hersh article, unidentified sources have reported

that the IEC was established by the White House in 1970 to collect

and evaluate information about radical and antiwar groups. The

article claims that the IEC is operated "clandestinely" out of the

Justice Department and has reported directly to John Dean, former

White House Counsel, and John Caulfield, the former White House

staff member who allegedly. was involved in White House eltorts to cover

up the Watergate affair. Reportedly, the IEC was created on orders

rof John Ehrlichman and ugil Krogh, Trus an aide to Ehrlichman has

been connected with IC at various limest

106.

The article cites possibility. Dean may have relied on intelligence

estimates produced by IEC to back up a beliëf that a White House

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

intelligence operation was needed during the national political

conventions last summer. Supposedly, government investigators

are now seeking to determine whether some of IEC's classified

reports may have been used by Justice Department agencies and

the White House to justify "undercover and double-agent activities"

against groups opposed to the Nixon Administration, including the

Democrats.

The "Times" article referred to testimony by James McCord

to the effect that officials of the Internal Security Division of Justice

Department had supplied the Committee for the Reelection of

the President with intelligence reports on radical activities for

possible political use. McCord claimed to have visited the "analysis

and evaluation section" of Internal Security Division to receive

some material. In reply to a question, Mecord exprassed the

belief that he had obtained this intormation from the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee.

The "Times" has identified Bernard Wells, a former FBI Agent,

as head of IEC and claims that IEC members include officials of

FBI, CIA, NSA and "various other police and official units." IEC

was reportedly set up to meet the grave threat posed by radical and

antiwar groups. The article notes that in response to this threat

the FBI and Justice Department had developed an'elaborate system

of undercover agents," although it did not specifically charge that

IEC had engaged in this activity.

Presidential Assistant Ehrlichman and that it would operate

from the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House.

He said the Committee would be headed by Morell Sharp, former

judge from the State of Washington, and he expressed the hope

that all member agencies, including the FBI, would appoint top

men to represent them in the group. Mr. Hoover assured

Mardian of the FBI's co-operation in this endeavor. On 12/1/70,

Section Chief G. C. Moore of the Domestic Intelligence Division,

was named as the FBI's representative. In December, 1970, and

during the early months of 1971, several meetings of the group

were held in the office of John Dean. They were attended by

representatives of Justice, CIA, FBI, NSA, Secret Service,

Defense Department, Treasury Department, Mr. Dean, Mr. Krogh,

Mr. Mardian and Judge Sharp. At the initial meeting; the group

adopted the name Intelligence Evaluation Commitice and iviardian

explained that the group had been assigned the mission of pooling

information regarding political terrorism in the U.S. According

to Mardian, the Committee would report to Ehrlichman and H. R.

Haldeman at the White House as well as Attorney General Mitchell

and they, in turn, would advise the President so that he could weigh

what federal action was necessary. During one meeting Krogh

cautioned those present that the White House wanted to make

certain there were no leaks to the press regarding the IC.

As a matter of fact, during late January, 1971, it was announced

that Judge Sharp was dropping out as head of IEC in view of the fact

that his presence in the Executive Office Building had caused several

for the permanent working staff of IEC. Mr. Hoover acceded

to this request and two Domestic Intelligence Division Supervisors

R. D. Cotter and G. T. Tunstall) were designated along with

a secretary. FBI staff support for the IEC has continued to the

present time except beginning in July, 1972, only one Agent Supervisor

has been assigned to the Committee.

Other agencies have also supplied staff support for IEC. For

example, for the first year and a half Department of Defense

furnished a professional analyst and during the summer of 1971,

NSA provided a security specialist on a full-time basis. All member

agencies have designated representatives who attend the regular

weekly staff meetings of IEC and who furnish assistance on a part-time

basis.

Organization and Activities of IEC

IEC is headed by an Executive Director, former FBI Agent Wells, and

a Deputy, another former FBI Agent (James McGrath). The IEC has two

full-time secretaries including one from the FBI. During roughly the

first six months of IEC's existence, its efforts were devoted primarily

to preparing periodic intelligence estimates with reference to antiwar

activities, especially the May, 1971, activities at Washington, D. C.

Thereafter, the IEC has given its attention to and prepared reports

concerning a variety of domestic intelligence matters of likely interest

to the President, most of them revolving around possible civil disorders.

For instance, the IEC has prepared several reports dealing with the

potential of racial violence, another dealing with prison riots and

throughout the spring and summer of 1972, the Committee prepared

a series of intelligence summaries dealing with the potential for

violence at the two major political conventions held in Miamt Beach.

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

To our knowledge, James McCord has never had any

connection with the IEC. It appears that McCord's reference

to the "analysis and evaluation section" may have denoted a

unit which did exist in the Internal Security Division of the

Department, namely the Analysis and Evaluation Unit, which was

under Mardian's direction.

At no time has the IC engaged in any activities of an

operational nature or made any recommendations for operational

activities. It has concerned itself entirely with preparing summary-

type estimates based on the information contributed by member

agencies. While its reports have been classified, they have generally

speaking not involved particularly sensitive information and they

have all rclated to subversive or criminal activities of one type

or another of likely interest to the White House. It is hard to visualize

how any political use could have been made of any IEC's raports.

In any case, FBI representatives on the IC have no knowledge

whatever of any political ramifications in the activities of this group.

One particular project undertaken by the IEC should be mentioned.

During July, 1971, Assistant Attorney General Mardian called a

meeting of the IEC and explained that he had just returned from

seeing the President in San Clemente, and that as a result of his

visit with Mr. Nixon, he was charging the IEC with the preparation

of a comprehensive report regarding the handling of classified and

sensitive information. Mardian noted this study had been prompted

by the Ellsberg case but said that the IEC would in no way concern itself

with the Husberg matter from an investigative or prosecutive stand-

point. Mardian said the President wanted the IC to conduct an

overall review of all factors relating to classification and protection.

of national defense formation and ta make appropriate recommendations

for Mr. Nixon's consideration.

Shortly thereafter, during the last week of July, 1971, IEC's

Executive Director Doherty reported to the IC staff that a White

House staff member had been appointed to work with.IEC.in conqueting.

its inquiries with regard to the handling of classified information.

The latter was identified as Gordon Liddy, who has recently received

considerable notoriety in connection with the Ellsberg case.

Re: INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE

Liddy did meet on one occasion with the IC staff in

August, 1971, at which time he discussed the project in very

general terms. This was the only contact Liddy had with the

IEC, either personally or in writing, to the knowledge of the

FBI representatives.

The IEC published a special report in

November, 1971, entitled "The Unauthorized Disclosure of

Classified Information" which completed this particular

assignment. This study alluded to the Ellsberg situation, but

only as a case in point. It dealt primarily with existing federal

procedures for the handling of classified data and set out nine

specified recommendations to tighten these procedures.

BJECT: "INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (TEC)

An article in today's "Evening Star and Daily News"

under the heading "Senators Seeking Radical Ties Data"

reports information from the Associated Press regarding the

alleged connections of the IEC with political espionage-type

activities. The article presents a totally misleading picture

of the IEC.

Specifically, the "Star" piece claims that unidentified

sources close to the Watergate investigation have reported that the

IEC was established in December, 1970, after FBI Director Hoover

bad objecied lo a Tun Secrei White House plan devised In imprors.

U.S. intelligence operations. Reportedly, the IFC was established

ostensibly to improve co-ordination among U.S. intelligence agencies

and prepare estimates of domestic intelligence, however, it soon

became "a cover for a secret police operation. " The article further

charged that the IEC had used its access to government agencies to

intercept mail, tap telephones, review income tax returns and plant

informers. One source was quoted "They (the IEC) were using

the national-security plan that Hoover objected to. That was the

blue print. "

A United Pres International story released early today cites

similar allegations carried by the New York "Daily News." In addition,

this story charges that a break-in at the Chilean Embassy in May, 1972,

was part of the plan for domestic espionage (apparently referring to

the plan devised by an interdepartmental ad hoc intelligence committee

in June, 1970),

These news stories are way off base. As reported in my prior

memorandum 5/21/73 entitled "Intelligence Evaluation Committee,"

the IEC has at no time been operational nor made any recommendations

for operational activity.

It has had no connection whatever with any

type of espionage activities or with the mail interception; wire tapping,

informant activities or the monitoring of income tax returns.

It is entirely separate and distinct from the temporary interdepartmental

committee on intelligence (Ad Hoc) which prepared an extensive

report on internal security matters in June, 1970.

The burglary at the Chilean Embassy in May, 1972, had

no connection with any government operations, clandestine

or otherwise, so far as we know. This burglary was reported

to the Metropolitan Police Department which conducted an inquiry

showing that four or five radios and one electric razor were stolen.

No national security angles developed and no FBI investigation was

ever conducted.

DATE: 6/4/73

The Seattle Office has submitted an airtel

enclosing a letterhead memorandum, both dated 5/30/73 and

attached, setting forth some "concerns" from U. S. District Judge

Morxell E. Sharp, Western District of Washington, Seattle, as

expressed with regard to the captioned Committee, which is now

receiving a substantial amount of publicity in the press.

Judge Sharp is a former Supreme Court Justice of the

State of Washington who originally was to have headed the IC as

its operating shairmon and did; in fact, attend sevoral of the

early meetings. I attended the meetings of this Committee as the

Bureau's representative.

In the incoming letterhead memorandum Judge Sharp, among

other things, related that "while the initial purposes of the group

appear to be quite legitimate there was some discussion about soine

clandestine operations that may be engaged in and at this point it

became evident to him that he did not want to have any part of it

and furthermore he did not want to operate in Washington without

his real purpose being known to his contacts in the State of

Washington, namely Senator Jackson and Senator Magnuson."

Although Judge Sharp might have been aware of some

"clandestine" operations discussed in his presence by Mr. Robert.

Mardian of the Department of Justice (prime mover in establishing

the IC) of on the part ofcothers that t was not la party to, ram

would be as well as the overall purpose of the Committee. (I might

add that very few present seemed to have any conception either as

to what form the Committee should take, including Mardian, who

evidently had been given the assignment to establish a committee

which would coordinate intelligence and furnish evaluations to the

President.)

A considerable amount of concern was voiced by both

Mardian and John W. Dean III (who represented The White House) at

these early meetings as to the necessity for keeping the functions

of this unit away from the press and prevent The White House from

being identified with the group.

Judge Sharp was cautioned during

each meeting very carefully in this regard as to how to handle

this matter in the event of a press inquiry.

In this regard there is attached one copy each of

memoranda dated 12/3/7U and 12/16/70 which set out details relative

to White House concern as to the necessity for providing a

security cover for the IEC. You will note that Page 2 of the

12/3/70 memorandum shows that Mardian was instructed by the

Attorney General to have Judge Sharp's salary paid by the Justice

Department and the Committee would be considered to be operating

under the Justice Department's auspices and arrangements were being

made for space in Federal Office Building Number Seven near The

White House.

It was also indicated that original thinking was to

have the Committee go by the name of "The White House Intelligence

Evaluation Committee" but because of possible publicity it was

one go by

decided by the Attorney General not to have The White House in the

title but have the Committee operate under some insignificant name

such as the!'

"Intelligence Evaluation Committee.' The purpose of

this would be to respond to the press better in the event of an

inquiry.

The 12/16/70 memorandum Indicates Mr. Egil Krogh,

The

attached to The White House, was present at that particular meeting

and "caütioned everyone that The Whitë House wanted to make certain

everything was done to prevent any leakage to the press that the

IEG was in existence. It was indicated that if any such inquiry

was made Judge Sharp or Mr. Mardian would handle same by stating

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

the Committee was operating under the Justice Department in

connection with the operation of the Interdivision Information

Unit (IDIU). Mr. Mardian stated, in fact, that the IEC had nothing

whatever to do with the IDIU but

the response would be for security

cover purposes only.

Our files show Judge Sharp attended three meetings of

the IEC all during the initial stages of its development -- first

on 12/3/70 followed by meetings on 12/16/70 and 1/11/71. He did

not attend the fourth scheduled meeting on 1/25/71. At that

meeting Mr. Mardian explained the absence of Judge

Sharp by stating

there had been several inquiries made by acquaintances of Judge

Sharp in Congress which caused the Attorney General and White House

concern that it would be difficult to maintain appropriate security

concerning the Committee's work with Judge Sharp as its head and

in an office located so near The White House (Federal Office Building

Number seven. Mardian stated that accordingly, ai a meering itiu

1/21/71 at The White House, attended by Mardian, John W. Dean III,

the Attorney General, H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman, it was

decided to have the Committee function in space occupied by the

Internal Security Division of the Department, 315 Ninth Street,

Northwest, and that Judge Sharp should be removed from the Committee

and assigned to other consultant duties with the Justice Department.

A copy of the 1/26/71 memorandum is also attached.

In addition to the above, it is my own personal recollection

that Judge Sharp was very much concerned about the nature of his

assignment in that he frequently made trips to the State of

Washington and friends would ask him what type of work he was doing.

He said that he was never really able to give them a satisfactory

answer and this bothered. him-somewhat.

OBSERVATIONS

;:.

0620r272028

Unless Judge Sharp is aware of "clandestine" plans of IEC

that were not. discussed in my présence, it would appear that the

above secrecy set-up involving a "cover" for security purposes

could have been reason enough for the Judge to want out

only planned to be in Washington temporarily awaiting a judgeship in

the State of Washington:

It was

also my recollection that he was'a

friend of Mr. Ehrlichman.

SUBJECT

DECLASSIFICATION MATTER

On 2/19/74, Mr. Kevin Maroney, Deputy Assistant Attorney

General of the Criminal Division, contacted me and inquired whether

two prior FBI letters to the Department can now be declassified. The

items in question are our letters- to the Internal Security Division dated

1/27/71 and 2/3/71 both entitled "Intelligence Evaluation Committee,

Internal Security - Miscellaneous. " These letters both deal with' the

issue of whether or not the FBI would provide personnel to staff the

Committee. They were classified on the grounds that disclosure of the

existence of the Intelligence Evaluation Committee could damage

national defense.

At the time these communications were prepared (1971) the White

House had indicated a desire to keep the existence of the Intelligence

Evaluation Committee secret. However, during the past year there has

been considerable publicity revealing no only the existence of IEC but

details of those operations. Hence, there is no longer any grounds for

retaining the classification of these communications. I advised Mr. Maroney

• that both letters could be declassified and appropriate steps have been

taken to so mark them.

Maroney desired declassification of these items in connection with

certain Departmental communications he is furnishing to the Senate

Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights.

REQUEST OF GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE

ON BEHALF OF CONGRESSVAN ROYBAL

By letter 7/18/74, Mr. Daniel F Stanton, Assistant Director:

General accounting Unice (GAO); has advised that GAO is conducting

inquiry regarding former Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC) on

behalf of Congressman Edward I roybal. Stanton specifically has

requested the following data (1) rames of the FBI personnel, including

secretaries, who participated in activities of IEC either as members of

Committee or working staff and periods they served; (2) estimate of

funds expended by FBI in support of IEC and the appropriations from

which such paymcats were made.

Based on request of former Assistant Attorney General Mardian

we designated a Special Agent to represent Bureau on IEC. on inception

of this group in December, 1970, until it was dissolved in June, 1973.

Other agencies represented on IEC included Justice Department, Central

Intelligence Agency, Defense Department, Secret Service, Treasury

Department and National Security Agency. With regard to members of the

working staff, Mr. Hoover initially resisted a request by Mardian for

us to supply FBI personnel for this purpose. However, in May, 1971,

former Attorney General Mitchell requested in writing that we furnish

two Agents and a secretary as members of the IEC working staff.

Accordingly, beginning 6/1/71, we did staff the IEC working group. Two

SAs were named full time to this assignment initially, however, beginning

6/1/72 this was reduced to one Agent. One secretary was assigned to

the IEC working group continuously from 6/1/71 - 6/11/73 when IEC was

disbanded.

In his letter, Stanton indicates that he has already been furnished

certain information by the Justice Department. In view of this and the

fact that the IEC was operated under the Department's direction, it

is believed we should consult with the Attorney General before replying

to GAO. We do not ordinarily furnish the identities of FBI personnel on

specific assignments to outsiders and GAO has not shown a specitic

need for this data.

ACTION: Attached is letter to Attorney General with copy to Deputy Attorney

General advising of the GAO request and requesting the Attorney

INTELLIGENCE EVALUATION COMMITTEE (IEC)

SURJECT REQUEST OF GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE ON

BEHALF OF CONGRESSMAN ROYBAL

Reference is made to memorandum from A. B. Fulton to me, 7/26/74,

in captioned matter. You requested a memorandum be prepared outlining the

background and activities of the ItC.

On 11/25/70 Assistant Attorney General Robert Mardian of the Internal

Security Division contacted Director J. Edgar Hoover. He advised that he had

been commissioned by President Nixon to establish an Interdepartmental

Intelligence Unit for the purpose of pooling intelligence information from various

agencies regarding violent demonstrations or other efforts to overthrow the

Government. Mardian said the group had the support of Presidential Assistant

Ehrlichman,

that it would operate from the Executive Office Building, and

would be headed by Morell Sharp, a former judge, Mr. Hoover assured Mardian

of the FBI's cooperation and on 12/1/70 Section Chief G. C. Moore of the

Intelligence Division was named as the FBI representative.

In December, 1970, and during the early months of 197, several

meetings of the group were held in the office of John Dean. They were attended

by representatives of Justice, Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, National

Security Agency (NSA), Secret Service, Defense Department, Treasury

Department, Mr. Dean, Mr. Egil Krogh, Mr. Mardian, and Judge Sharp. At

the initial meeting, the group adopted the name "Intelligence Evaluation

Committee" and Mardian explained that it had been assigned the primary mission

of pooling inforination concerning political terrorism in the U. S. According to

Mardian, the Committee would report to Ehrlichman and H. R. Haldeman at

The White House as well as Attorney General Mitchell, and they, in turn, would

advise the President so that he could weigh what action was necessary. During

one meeting Krogh cautioned that The White House wanted no leaks to the press

regarding the IC.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

Request of General Accounting Office on

Behalf of Congressman Roybal

In late January, 1971, it was announced that Sharp was dropping out as

head of lEC since his presence in the Executive Office Building had prompted press

inquiries. At the same time, it was decided to move IC from the Executive Office

Building to the Internal Security Division of the Department and to place it under

the direction of a Departmental official, John Doherty.

One of the early problems facing the IC was the question of statfing.

Mr. Hoover initially declined a request from Mardian to provide staff support.

However, on 5/17/71 Attorney General Mitchell requested in writing that the Bureau

provide two Agents and one secretary for the IC working staff. Mr. Hoover

[acceded to this requesi and two Intelligence Division supervisors (P. D. Cotter and

G. T. Tunstall) were designated with a secretary. FBI staff support continued

until dissolution of IEC on 6/11/73 (although beginning in July, 1972, one Agent was

recalled.

Other agencies also supplied limited support for EC. During the first

year and one-half, the Defense Department provided a professional analyst and

during Summer of 1971 NSA furnished a full-time security specialist. Other agencies

also designated representatives who attended weekly staff meetings and furnished

assistance on a part-time basis.

Following retirement of Doherty in September, 1971, IEC was headed by

a former FBI Agent, Bernard F. Wells, with another ex-Agent, James McGraph,

(serving as his deputy.

During the first part of 1971, IEC efforts were devoted primarily to

preparing periodic intelligence estimates on antiwar activities and demonstrations

and during 1972 a large part of the IC's efforts was directed to preparing summaries

of possible demonstrations at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.

However, IC was preparing a variety of other reports of possible interest to the

President, most of them revolving around possible civil disturbances. "This

included reports dealing with the potential of racial violence and another dealing

with prison disturbances.

One project undertaken by IC deserves special mention. During July, 1971,

Mardian called a special meeting of IEC and explained he had just returned from

meeting the President in San Clemente. He said that the IC was commissioned to

/prepare a comprehensive report concerning the handling of classified information.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re: Intelligence Evaluation Committee (IEC)

Request of General Accounting Office on

Behalf of Congressman Roybal

Mardian indicated this had been prompted by the Ellsberg case but said IEC would

not concern itself with the Ellsberg matter from an investigative or prosecutive

standpoint. He said the President wanted IEC to conduct an overall review of factors

relating to the protection of national defense information.

Shortly thereafter, Mr. Doherty reported that a White House staff member,

Gordon Liddy, had been named to work with IEC in handling this project. Liddy

met on one occasion, in August, 1971, with the IC staff, and discussed the project

in general terms. In November, 1971, IC published a special report entitled "The

Unauthorized Disclosure of Classified Information, " which completed this assignment.

Normally, IEC projects originated with John Dean, although there were some

exceptions such as a report on terrorist activities requested by the President's

Cabinet Committee on Terrorism. IEC estimates were furnished to Dean and the

heads of each member agency, inciuding ine Attorney General.

There has been some speculation that the IC was actually an outgrowth of

the so-called "Huston Plan" which had been briefly approved by President Nixon in

Ithe Summer of 1970. This plan called for the liting of various investigative

restraints on U. S. intelligence agencies (relating to covert mail coverage, wire-

taps, surreptitious entry, etc.) and also urged the formation of an interagency

intelligence group to keep The White House advised regarding matters of domestic

intelligence interest. This plan was scotched by The White House based on the

strenuous objections of FBI Director Hoover as well as Attorney Generad Mitchell.

However, a memorandum prepared by John Dean in September, 1970, revived the

idea of an interagency intelligence group which would not only provide evaluations of

domestic intelligence for the President but which would also be operational in nature.

Circumstances indicate this memorandum was a forerunner to establishment of 1EC.

in ade shoula be stressed

" however, that at no time did I#C engage in any

activities of an operational nature nor did it make any recommendations Ior

operational activity. It concerned itself wholly with preparing summary-type

estimates based on data contributed by member agencies. FBI representatives on

the IEC have no knowledge whatever of anyspolitical ramifications in the activities

of this group.
