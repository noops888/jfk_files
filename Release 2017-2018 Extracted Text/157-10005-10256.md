ACTIVITY

Caribbean Admission Center,

po-Locka, Florida, fully

tivated by 15 March 1962.

TOP SECRET SENSITIVE

_ 15 March 1962 (cont)

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence required for the

operations, to identify and earmark in-

telligence assets as refugees arrive,

and to provide security against Com-

munist agent operations.

Periodic intelligence esti

ates, as required by progress

operations.

To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current

estimates can be considered at national

policy levels,

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendation

as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at

utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with

a new building completed and occupied, and with a

•staff of 43 at work, Operations commenced 15 February

and, as of & March,

33 people were active at the Center.

(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,

State, USIA.)

As the operations develop, there will be both increased

intelligence collection and a need for as current an in-

telligence Estimate as the U,S. can produce meaningfully.

It is likely that a more informal method of producing an

Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than

=port summing up intelligence for this purpose. (Cl

esponsibility, with support of others as required.

ER OPERATIONS

orhotive lubricants

ACTIVITY

stablish 2 additional third-

puntry resident agents i

Cuba

By 31 March, have 105 agents

selected and 50 agents trained.

TOP SECRET SENSITIVE

16 - 31 March 1962 (cont.)

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence.

CONSIDERATIONS

Possible future use in communications and support.

To ready agent operationes:

* Develop intelligence potential

of Cuban "colonies" in U.S.

To exploit the intelligence possi

bilities of former residents of

Cuba (including U.S. citizens) now

in the United States.

* Develop additional interroga-

¡on centers in other areas by

31 March 196z.

To colleci intelligence in a Latin

atmosphere, at different levels thai

now seem possible in the continental

U.S., to spot additional intelligence

assets and to provide security

against Communist agent operations.

Effectiveness and numbers are

dependent upon purpose

of recruitment, nature of training,

and policy decisions

controlling these factors.

If the recruitment and train-

ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-

ment and training will be much less difficult than if

they are limited to intelligence-collection purposes

only.

There are "colonies" in Washington, D.C., and other

U.S. cities which are

"little Cubas," Family, Church,

and business interests provoke unusual personal ties

inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential

exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-

able.

(FBI support and coordination is basic in this

effort.)

As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CLA will activate

other interination enters as prompel ta easible,

Negotiations with

local authorities are being undertaken to activate centers,

if possible,

fare being sur-

veyed for possible centers.

(CLs responsibility with sup-

port by others as necessary,)
