Re :

Note continued:

Robert C. Ode, American Embassy, Bern, has received

request from State Department for information concerning the

Alex ban and has requested legat to furnish him with infor-

mation to answer this request.

In making request of Embassy

Jr.,

indicated Department of Justice has file on Alex, but that he

had not yet heard from the FBI.

No record located that Smith or Department of state

has made any request of Bureau for information on Alex (per

Records Section).

Inasmuch as no record located of State

Department request and in view of current controversy involving

foreign travel of American citizens, no contact with State

Department being made.

Legat Bern being instructed to advise Embassy

representative we do not know reason for issuance of ban by

Swiss authorities and, therefore, are not in position to

furnish information concerning this. Previous instructions

to Legat to handle

matter to avoid involvement of Bureau being

restated.

It is suggested that I reply to ODE as follows:

In past years, the Swiss Police have been

requested to furnish any information they might have con-

cerning the activities and contacts of GUS ALEX while in

Switzerland, in view of his association with individuals

with criminal records. In February 1965 the Swiss

authorities issued an

entry ban against ALEX. No request

was made to the Swiss authorities for an entry ban against

ALEX, nor was it indicated to them that such would. be

desirable.

It is understood from Swiss sources that the

Swiss

authorities cannot be legally required to reveal

the reason for the issuance of an entry ban.

The foregoing is furnished for the information

of the Department of State and it is requested that it

not be disseminated outside that agency.

In view of the statement in the letter of

FREDERICK SMITH,

IR.,. that he had not yet heard from the FBI,

it is presumed that he has made inquiry of the Bureau in this

matter.

The Bureau is therefore requested to review

what information,

if any, was furnished Mr. SMITH, and then

inform if it considers the above information appropriate to

furnish ODE. Mr. ODE has indicated that he would greatly

appreciate expedite action by me in this case.
