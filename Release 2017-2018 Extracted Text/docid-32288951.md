ADMINISTRATIVE

On August 14, 1967, MM 1231-C-TE, an active

member of the La Cosa Nostra (LCN) at Miami, Florida,

advised that a large movement of narcotics was imminent,

involving traffic throughout the east and connected with

international personages. Informant stated that several

LCN members were involved, including SANTO TRAFFICANTE

at Miami. He further stated that the area of activity.

would be in Miami.

With regard to LCN activities in South Florida,

informant stated that SANTO TRAFFICANTE and PASQUALE

ERRA share these responsibilities.

TRAFFICANTE has

control of the southeast portion of the United States,

while ERRA represents

those areas of Miami under the

influence of New York, particularly the Bronx.. Since

ERRA represented the GENOVESE family, and that family

is considered the most powerful, ERRA is accorded the

most respect.

On August 18, 1967, MM 1231-C-TE stated that

SANTO TRAFFICANTE is "head of family" and maintains some

degree of control in the South Florida area.

Source.

knew of no one to whom TRAFFICANTE would have to answer.

He described TRAFFICANTE's position in the LCN as equal

to that of other heads of family" throughout the country.

source

stated that TRAFFICANTE, therefore, would receive

at least a piece of all gambling action, including

bookmaking and bolita in South Florida.

Source stated

that TRAFFICANTE would have been the world's richest

hoodlum had it not been for his forced departure from

Cuba. ai
