ANNEX 2.

CUBAN IN DALLAN TEXAS, U:S.A!...

MIGUEL CASAS SAEZ,

22 or 23 years of age,

born in Remedios, Las Villas,

• son of Joaquin CASAS (Alias) "Quintello"

(this family is callec

by everyone "Los Quintellos") and'of Georgina SAEZ Lopez,

known as "la

With thy l, vet the sald cate hume do heele dario have his

background before the revolution, maybe because he was so young, but

after it, he became an ardent revolutionary, follower of Rau. castro.

He went through the Department of Constructions of, the ministry of

Education at tbe same time chat he was a militiaman in Remedios nilexe

he was known on account of doing more than what was required of

Later he was transferred to the State Security Department (G-2), which

was no secret to anyone because of the way he bakaved.

From time to

time he was gone from the city of Remedios, a thing that didn't amaze

of bothered anyone because of the quality of the person.

His aunt, Lucia LOPEZ MARRIED TO MR. WILFREDO RUISSCH, a rormer

shoemaker in Canajuani, head-town of the municipality next to Remedios;

this couple live on the Andres Cuevas St. #54 at the mentioned town

I camajuani, L.V. Now this Ruissch is in charge of the Trust of Leathe

which takes care of the distribution of Unit #402 of the Shoemaker$ o1

Camajuani; she (Lucia Lopez), upon a visit to the dentist, whom I have

known for many years as a responsible and serious person,

she expressed

herself in the following manner...-

"My nephew "Miguelito"

he was in Dallas

brought him to cuba

she continued to say

of Raul's men (refering to Raul Castro); Miguelito is very brave,

very brave!"

Miguelito, he

says he knows the so caller

He had

firing practice while in the militias and the doctor considers this

man capable of doing anything.

Immediately I called two of my best men in Camajuani, one of them a

shoemaker who knows Wilfredo Russch very well and I gave him instructions

on this matcer,

but I didn't tell them too much of what I knew;

"M.C.S. was a poor person, poorly dressed, and after he was missing

Remedios for several

weeks but this was not strange due to his

condition of militiaman and indoctrinated revolutionary, but now he

cresses weld, has a lot of money, owns large amounts of

I-shirts,

jackets and

shoes. all American made.

The rumers, are that he has given

some pairs of shoes to some of his friends.

"They were in a bar near

him and were able to observe that the shoes they were wearing were

American made'•

1e seems that he departed from Daddas texas with two triends,

Dentist believes he is following the tracks of one of them. It & have

had any means of transmitting this message, you would have known about

it at least ten days ago, but we have no other means to do it.
