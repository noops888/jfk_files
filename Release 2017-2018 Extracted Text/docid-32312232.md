1. CUFRENT COUNTERINTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY

arxisu-veniniste

The Bureau has authorized the mailing of

Progressive Labor literature to 3 CP members in Seattle

who were somewhat upset over receipt of the letter

they received from the ACTMLCP concerning the new CP jouth

organization.

They thought the letter came from

Progressive Labor.

The NYO

intended to send the July

issue of

"progressive Labor" but as of this writing,

this issue is not yet out. If it appears the July

issue is going to be

a copy of

"challenger heluded in the August losue, then

, the weekly Progressive Labor

news letter, will be sent to the seattle subjects.

are the

informants designated to participate in the Counterintelligence

Program.

participate in the program this month.

6. Miscellaneous

Camp Webatuck

Appropriate counterintelligence suggestions will

be made when we learn the identity of the church group that

is reportedly interested in buying Camp Webatuck.

The Bureau has denied NY authority to mail an

anonymous letter to the president of the NY Bar Association

pointing out LANE's Marxist leanings and the fact he is a

sexual pervert.

MARVINY MARKMAN

NYO

*Pursuant to instructions in Bulet 4/22/64, the

sent a summary

to San Francisco of the counter-

intelligence action taken against MARVIN MARKMAN so that

San Francisco would be in a better position to make

follow-up recommendations in the MARKMAN case. MARKMAN

is living in the San Francisco area..

CP Activity in

Leonia, New Jersey

Two agents assigned to the NYO who live in Leonia,

New Jersey, have become aware of a large group of people

in Leonia who have Communist backgrounds and have been

hindering the paper functioning of the Leonia Board of

Education.

This information was furnished to the Newark

Office for possible use under the Counterintelligence Program.
