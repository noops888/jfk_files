On 9/18/61, MM-726-S advised SA Leman L. Stafford, Jr.

he had ascertained that subject has two vessels which are located

on the Miami River, Miami, Florida.

According to informant,

subject and his wife are both receiving money from the Cuban

anti-Castro organization, FRENTE REVOLUCIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (ERD)

and live on one of these vessels. Informant stated subject

apparently monitors the marine band which is also used by Cuban

radio stations and he is apparently taking some of the data

received and furnishing it to the FRD headquarters.

Informant said it has been rumored that at times subject??

has made certain transmissions on 2764 kilocycles in an effort

to disrupt the communications of the Cuban radio stations which

operate on this frequency. Informant was unable to state if

such rumor is true. Informant learned that subject reportedly

is installing a broadcast transmitter for the purpose of beaming

anti-Castro propaganda to Cuba, and it is reported that such

transmissions will be carried

out from the vessel "Monterrey."

On 9/29/61, ARTHUR GILBERT, Radio Engineer in Charge,

FCC, advised he has no information concerning subject.

Subject's INS file has been located at Miami and will

be reviewed for pertinent background information. Contact will

Gibe maintained with MM-726-S and other sources for additional

information concerning subject and his activities, and a report
