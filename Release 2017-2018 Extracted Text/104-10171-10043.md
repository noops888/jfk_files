CHORANDUN FOR THE RECORD

SUBJSCT: Anti-Castro Cuban Actirities at the Eighth World Youth Featival

This memorandun vill outline the activities of the anti-Cantro

Cuban delegation that CIA sent to Helsinks for the Eighth World Youth

Festival, 29 July - 6. August 1962.

The delegation was sponsored overtly by the Directorio Revolu

Elonarto Estudiant1l (DRE) and conleted or nine wenbers Its megion

was to nullify the offect of the Castroite Cuban delegation to the

festival and to seok to persuade. likely defectors fron that delegation.

On the opening day of the festival, as delegations paraded through

the atreeta to

stadius,

five DRE delegates unfurled a banner in tront.

of the Cuban delegation deminding that Castro tree bis tbousande of polit-

Ical prisoners.

(Reporta vary on the actual text of the banner.) The

Cuban delegation broke ranks from the parade and attacked the DRE memberg,

pushing tbem backvard into a crowd of Finnish spectators. The Finna rallied

to the ald of the DRE members. and a General Melee followed, much to the na

later embarrassment of the Cuban delegation and the festival sponsora.

This incident was unrelated to the Pinnish rioting that folloved

for three days after the festival opened. Eut It 1s lIkely that the 1n-

cident helped to exacerbate the anti-communiat tension that caused the

rioting. Apparently with this view, Finnish police pieked up two of the

Dre members and questioned them.

After releasing them, the police sought

tbe tvo agalo.

Unfortunately, the tvo DRE members happened to be riding

in a car that collided with a

police car on. the night of 1 August.. The

two vere. Jailed overnight and released the next day with the suscestion

that tbey leave Finland as soon as they could. Accordiasly, the shole DRE

delegation left on 2 Auguat to 50 t0 Germany to attend a Christian Demo
