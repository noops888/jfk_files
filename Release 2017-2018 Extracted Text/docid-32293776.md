After a brief discussion concerning this point,

GREENE began to discuss the MARFEO murder which occurred in

Rhode Island.

Again GREENE questioned the informant as to

the informant's knowledge of each individual indicted for

this crime and in particular desired to know whether the

informant had met any of the defendents in Rhode Island

and the circumstances surrounding any such naming.

He also desired to know whether JACK KELLEY

KneW RAYtIOND PATRIARCA, whether he ever met with PATRIARCA

in Rhode Island, and everything the informant knew of the

circumstances of any such meeting between KELLEY and

PATRIARCA, particularly the place of the meeting.

The informant told GREENE that while he believed

KELLEY knew PATRIARCA, he had no knowledge of any meeting

between the two men. U

GREENE told informant that it was necessary to

KELLEY and PATRIARCA and that all efforts were being made

to develop information to disprove KELLEY'S statements in

this regard.

It was informant's impression based on the limited

amount of time that he devoted to the discussion of the Brink's

robbery that GREENE was primarily interested in the MAFEO

murder case in which the ICN people had a greater interest.

This impression was further supported by the fact that upon

the informant's arrival at GREENE'S office, Attorney AL

HORRIGAN, Attorney for JERRY ANGIULO, was present and gave

the definite impression of being in charge of the inguiry. L

During the interview, GREENE told informant that

it may become necessary for the informant to sion a certain

as davit on statements which were being prepared in order

to preclude informant from becoming involved as a witness

in support of KELLEY. U

Informant advised that only he and GREENE were

present during this interview. U

REINE said that he would be in touch with the

informant at a later time to continue their discussions.

robbery and the MARFEO murder and asked the informant if

the informant was aware that there had been numerous parking

tickets issued by the Boston Police Department involving
