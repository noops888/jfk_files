For the information of the Bureau, a check of toll calls

on telephone available to CIVELLO has not been made since prior to v

July, 1966.

As the Bureau is aware, CIVELLO became active in a

proposed deal with FRANK DESIMONE, his cousin and former LCN boss of

the family in Los Angeles, prior to DESIMONE's death on 8/4/67.

LA TE informant was also in active contact with CIVELLO regarding

proposed loan from the Teamsters Union to buy the Riviera Hotel in

Las Vegas.

CIVELLO recently made a trip to los Angeles, covered by

that office.

While check of toll calls on CIVELLO have

not always

would not be complete unless continuing review of his toll calls was

being made. DI 289-C,

who is close to and in frequent contact with

CIVELLO and in CIVELLO's home periodically, has advised that he has

been in CIVELLO's home on a number of occasions when CIVELLO has

received a number of long distance calls, which CIVELLO would not

accept, but told the party calling in the CI's presence that he would

call back on a public line.

REC 6

92-2824-133

Other factors to be taken into consideration are the

following:

If we do not periodically checksuch toll records and

it is later determined that a significant call was made, the record

could have already been destroyed by the telephone company.

With

the

new system of recording calls being used by Southwestern Bell

Telephone Company, much helpful incidental information is picked up

as noted by the operator on handling a long distance call. JAMES M.

MAUGHAN, Area Security Manager, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company,

and former Special Agent, is well aware of the Bureau's interest in

CIVELLO, and on several occasions has voluntarily offered to make

toll record information available on CIVELLO. It has not been

accepted in view of

the current regulations on the obtaining of such

information.
