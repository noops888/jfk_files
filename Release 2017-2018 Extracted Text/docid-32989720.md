CONFIDENTIAL, LMORANDUES

This morning, in accordance with the request of the President

conveyed to me personally by him last liednesday in New York City, 1 called

at the thite House at 9:15 and was with the President until 10:15.

He was desirous of discussing the quastion of the suoversive

activities in the United States, particularly Fascism and Coumunisa. He

hau preriously received the memorandun mich I had prepared covering y

conversation with Ganeral Smedley Butler and the effort of Father Cougalia

to have Caneralxbutler head an expedition to Mexico. I inzormad the President

concerzing certain recent develooments in the Comminist activities in tre

country, particularly the efforts of the Bridges organization in San Fran-

cisco and tneir progressive control oi the shipping on the Pacific Coast,

the Gulf Coast and teir recent

expansion to shipping operations or the

Atlantic Coast. I told him that nile their contract will empire on

Lewis. I told him that the Briüges organization vas practically cortrollad

by Connunisis and that the Comminists had nor decided to make very definita

plans to get control of the Levis organization.

I called his attention to the activities of the Newspaper Cuila

headed by Heywood Brown, mich has strong Communistic leanings, and which

has been responsible for putting out of oparation the Seattle Posü Inval-

ligencer. I told him that my information ras that the Commnists had planca

to get control of thesa three groups and by doing so they mouia be able at

any tino to paralyze the country in that they could stoo all shipping ir

and out through the Bridges organization; stop the operation of industr

through the hiring Union of Lewis; and stop publication of any newspapers

of the country tarough the Neispaper Guila.

I also related to hin tae activities which have recently oc-

currea ithin Governmental service irspired by Communists, particuiarly

in some of the Departments and in the National Labor Relations Zoard.

I likewise informed him that I had received information to the

iffect that the Comunist Internationale in Mascon has recently issued in-

suructions for all Communists in the United States to vota for Prasideni

Roosevelt for reelection and against Governor Landon because of the fact

trat Governor Landon is opposea to class warfara.

The President stated that he had been considerably concerned

about the movements of the Conmunists and of Fascism in toe United States

and that thile the Secret Service of üse Ireasury Department had assured

him that they had inormants in every Cormunisi group, he believed that

¡i thai vas true it was solely for the surpose of getting any infortation

upon plots upon his life, thereas what he was interested in was obtaining

a broad pictura of ine genaral movemest and its activities as mey affect tac

sion that it night investigate any matiers referred to it by the Departuent

of suate and that ii the State Departnent should ask for us to conduct such

priatica already granted.

He stated that he is reluctant to have a forma:

on in his safe in the white House, stating he had instructed the Secretary

of State to request this incormation to be obtained by the Department O1

Justice.

He stated he rould have the Secretary of State at the Waite House

tomorrow afternoon, and asked me to call at the Thite Housa at 1:45 p.m.

to see him, the Presideni, and the Secretary of State, at minich tire the

natter could be further discussed and an oral request coula be made oê be

by the Socretary of Stata for investigation so as to avoid ary possivility

of any leak.

He suggested that I endeavor to coordinate any investigation

along sinilar lines nich might be nade by the Military or Naval Intelligence

Services. He stated that the Secret Service was not being brought in on this

investigation as they should contine themselves strictly to the matuer of

protecting his life and the surver mich de desired to have made was on a

much broader field.

CONFIDENCIAL LENORANDUM

Poday, in line with the request of the President; I called at tze

White House at 1:45 p.n., and present at the conference were the Presidenu,

the secretary oi sinue and uyseli.

The President related to the Secretary o

State his concern iriative to cominist activities in this country, as well as

*Fascist activitiec.

He stated that he was very desirous of having a survey

made of these concitions and informed the Secretary of State that this surey

could be made by. ¿re Departmeni of Justice if the Secretary of State requested

the Department to conduct the inquiry, as under the Appropriation Act this

Bureau would hava autcority to nake such investigation il askea to do so by

the Secretory of State.

The President poinied out that both of these nove-

ments were interrational in scope and thai Communism particularly was directed

from Moscon, and that there had been certain indications that Ounansly, at-

torhad in the Russian Sovici Erbassy, was a leading figure in some of the

activities in this country, so consequently, it was a matter which feli ritazi

the scope of foreign affairs over maich the State Department would have a rigi

to request an inquiry to be inde.

The Secretary of State inquired it a request should be made in

writing.

The President indicnted that it should not be since he desired the

matter to be handled quite confidentially and that it woula be surficient thai

the President, the Secretary of State and I should be the ones aware of this

request.

The Secrotary of State asked that the investigation be made and then

made several suggestions - one, relative to the making of a protest, either

fornaliy or inforcally, to the Pussian Government relative to its intestereres

with affairs in this country.

Discussion was also had as to the information

obtained indicating that the Trira Internationale had indicated preference fos

Roosevelt as against Landon.

It was the opinion of the President that some

statement should be rade along this line by the Attorney General at an early

date. The President asked that I speak to the Attorney General, woon his re-

turn to the city, about this matter, and he suggested to the Secretary or

State that he talk over the technique to be folloved in this particular asject,

with the Attorney tereral.

DATE:

You requested analysis of the legal authority ior FBl

criminal intelligence collection and its relationship to ow statutory

jurisdiction in criminal matters.

"The gathering of criminal intelligence information"

describes activity not subject to precise definition..

• However, its

general objective is well understood by those engaged in law enforcement.

There exist individuals and groups whose daily occupations are direcied

toward proft without regard to the restraints or the law. rei, wy the

very natura ni their associations. little actual participation in criminal

acts may be observed by the most astute law enforcement observer.

Their existence and contribution to the sum of criminal behavior has been

detected and to some degree measured by the collection of data concerning

their personalhie-sigles, property holdings, associates, influence, and

access to capital. Such information has been characterized as "criminal

intelligence."

For years, the FBI has been aware of the need to identily

these resources of the criminal element. Congress responded to this

need through the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970. The Congressional

findings were that organized crime in the United States is a highly

sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains

billions of dollars from Amorica's economy by unlawful conduct and by

the illegal use of force, fraud and corruption. Legitimate business and

labor unions are infiltrated and corrupted and our democratic processes

are subverted. The problem was declared lo be of of national concern

both as to our economy and the domestic security.

were confirmed by the Congressional findings but statutory enactments

did not eliminate the conduct described as evil therein. There remains

the task of establishing the identities of those constituting the national

menace and developing prosecutable evidence of their guilt.

"Criminal

intelligence" collection is one means by which this responsibility may

be fulfilled. It may be the only practical means in view of the scarcity

of witnesses willing to testify and of the high mortality potential of those

who do appear. A classic example of such intimidation is reported in

United States v. Addonizio, 451 F2d 4y (Jrd CIr: i57Z) where a Muspectre

enoco in 2

coco found an anonymate mnts on the cost of his

car which read "This could have been a bomb. Keep your mouth shut. "

necessity, the sting emana for integried there as of cranitationa

protections. If the Supreme Court announces that individuals have a

Constitutionally protected right of privacy that may be overcome only

through established arrest, search, and subpoena procedures, the issuc

will be settled

but, thus lar, the Court has only drawn upon the concept

of Constitutional privacy to resolve cases involving special circumstances

such as marital ailairs (Criswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) ) and

interception of communications (Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1907)

More specific Constitutional limitations on the criminal

intelligence function may be found in the First Amenciment protections of

speech and assembly; the Fourth Amendment prohibitions of unreasonavie

searches and seizwes; and the fifth Amendment privilege against

compulsory self-incrimination.

The theme consistently found in decisions having a bearing on t!

r'clationship between these rights and the collection of criminai intolliya cs

is that, when in direct conflict, the collection eiforts must yield. Such is

not to label criminal intelligence as necessarily the product of malpractice.

but to recognize the paramount nature of the Constitutional interests being

safeguarded. Other incidents of government regulatory authority have

been required to yield as well when confronted with legitimate claims of

Constitutional protection, e. g. the administrative search cases, Camara v.

Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523 (1967).

Overt and obtrusive conduct susceptible of being characterized

•as harassment may well be enjoined as, for example, was the case of an

obvious 24-hour-a-day physical surveillance of an individual, his home,

relatives, friends, and associates (Giancana V. Johnson, 335 F2d 366

(7th Cir.

1964) cort. den. 379 U.S. 1001. Similar results might be

expected where an identitied officer loiters in the subject's place of

business (Bee See Books, Inc. V. Leary, 291 E. Supp. 622 (SD I. Y. 1963)

or openly attends organizational meetings where his presence innivits

309, United Furniture Workers v. Gates. 75.F. Supp. 620 (ND Ind. I956) ).

However, open photographic surveillance of public gatherings (Donahoe.

Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (ED Va. 1971)) and secret monitoring of

criminal activities through the use of undercover agents (Lewis v. United

States, 385 U.S. 206 (1966) ) and informants (Hoffa v. United States, 355

U.S. 295 (1966) ) have met with judicial approval.

Obviously, criminal intelligence information gained by un-

reasonable search and seizure or through compelled self-incrimination is

tainted and subject to judicial condemnation upon complaint of one having

the requisite standing.

Perhaps, the decision coming ncarest to discussing the

legality of criminal intelligence collection was Anderson v. Sills. 106 N. J.

However, the court order to destroy the intelligence files excepted instances

"where such information will be used to charge persons with specificall;

of criminal intelligence information where the objective is the establishmen:

FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS•

You requested an analysis of the Bureau's authority to conduct

domestic intelligence investigations. The question of the jurisdictional

basis for these investigations is being examined at length by the Domestic

Intelligence Division and will not be discussed here.

It is fair to say that the domestic intelligence program is one

of the more controversial areas of the Bureau's activities. For one thing,

an intelligence investigation casts a broader net than inquiries that ire

direciou toward the propinf a sporific offense. A large amount of raw cata

is collected, much of nich has no immediate bearing on potential offenses

or offenders. But seemingly trivial information may later become imporiani

in the detection and prevention of violence or civil disorder. There are

also fears that these investigations may eventually touch upon one's

political beljeis, habits or associations; or that information collected for

proper purposes may eventually be misused at the hands of Government.

Each is a legitimate concern.

The notion of Government prying into the

personal lives of its citizens is repellent to all of us. And yet there is a

strong sense that the Government must acquire necessary intelligence

information if it is to meet its responsibilities in connection with the

national security.

One of the major concerns about our domestic intelligence

activities is that they we not supervised or monitored by any outside

agency. The claim is made that the Executive Branch has been left wide

discrotion to define its own authority, and to choose the directions, mcthods,

and focus of its investigations. For one thing, the law has never made

clear what facts and circumstances must be present to authorize an•

intelligence investigation, nor how far such an investigation may lawhilly

procced without being directed toward proof of a specific olfense.

Hotis to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI AUTIGRITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

And unlike the practice in criminal cases, our electronic surveillances in

security matters are not submitted for prior court approval. For anothei,

the exclusionary rule which provides the usual method of judicial control

over investigative procedures, is not often available in securty cases.

Since the goal is largely preventive, these cases seldom come before the

cow'ts. As a result, the public, the courts, and the Congress have very

little information about how we operate in domestic intelligence matters.

and what we do with the information acquired.

In response to this situation, some members of the Congress have

pressured for tighter controls over the Bureau, perhaps in the form of a

watchdog committee to oversee our operations.

Senator Ervin, Who chairs

the Senate Subsommittee on Constitutional Rights has expressed particular

concern about the right of privacy and the authority of the Government to

gather information. In an exchange of correspondence with the Department

of Justice, the Senator has requested specific documentation of the

Department's guidelines for the gathering and retention of domestic

intelligence information. He has also suggested inat iegisiaiion migii ve

enacted, requiring a showing of probable cause before an investigation can

be initiated by the Government. It is doubtful that any such measure would

pass the Congress, but the proposal does show the mood of the times.

A parallol trend may be developing in the courts. In several

recent cases, plaintiffs have made the claim that Government information

gathering, which goes beyond the effort to apprchend criminal suspecis,

may have a "chilling effect"' on the exercise of First Amendment rights.

These challenges thus far have not been successful. Anderson v. sills.

56 N. J. 210, 265 A2d 678 (1970); Donahoe v. Duling, 330 E. Supp. 308

(E.D. Va. 1971); American Civil Libertics Union v. Westmorcland, 323

F. Supp. 1153 (N.D. Ill. 1971).

The courts have generally recognized that one of the principal

functions of the Bureau is to gather information law violators, gitators of

• violence and possible sibversives.. Tatum V. Laird, 444 E2d 217, 957

(D.C. Cir. 1971) cert. granted, 404 U.S. 935 (1971); The Filth Avenue

et. al., 70 Cr. 2640

Columbia Circuit, has obscived that the identity of the agency gathering

such information is determinative of the significance of any alleged chill tọ

to First Amendmentrights. Thus, in Davis v. Ichord, 442 F2d 1207 (D. C.

Cir. 1970) although appellants allegedly felt chilled by a Congressional

Commitice's investigation of them, the Court of Appeals found there was

insufficient justiciability in their claims to create a viable case or

controversy.

This was because appellants had failed to bring the fear oi

investigation by the present Committee home to themselves; their fears

were wholly speculative; there were no criminal proceedings contronting

them; nor was any action pending. Moreover, the Court in Davis found

that the power of a Congressional Committee began and ended with the

investigation; whenever & Commitice of the Congress seeks punilive action,

the Judiciary must become involved, and thus every investigation has a

judicial check which operates to guarantee the protection of constitutional

rights.

This latter aspect of the Davis decision was given jerspectire by

the Court of Appeals in 'Tatum. In contrasting the potential impact on First

Amendment rights occasioned by investigations conducted by the military

with investigations conducted by a civilian investigative agency, such as the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Court observed:

The compilation of data by a civilian investigative

agency is thus not the threat to civil liberties or the

deterrent on the exercise of the constitutional right

of free speech that such action by the military is, because

a civil investigative agency has no inherent power always

being subject to the well-defined restrictions of law and

the approval of the courts. ***

There, the Court pantedly examined the "source of the chill" as it had in

Davis, and in applying the "chilling effect doctrine", singled out the FBi

as a source which does not genciate a reasonable basis for inhiitions or

apprchensions. In this connection the Court stated.

Memorandum

B. Flotis to Mr. Dalbey

RE: FBI AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Referring to our holding in Davis that the

"source of the chill" is important in determining whether

there is any inhibiting cilect on the exercise of First

Amendment rights, we think that there is a significant

difference between investigative actions taken by a

military agency in reference to civilians and similar

investigative actions taken by a regular investigative

agency of a civilian branch of the Government.

One of the functions of a civilian investigative

agency, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is

to compile information on law violators, agitators of

violence, and possible subversives. It has always been

recognized that this is a delicate function, and it is

exercised under the direction of the Attorney General.

Investigation is performed by men a majority of whom are

under the direction of lawyers in the Justice Department,

and the information compiled is only usable and effective

through court action. The FBI is powerless to imprison

or to affect his liberty in any way except through the

action of the courts.

As to the surveillance of public meetings through the use of

iniormants, it has been held that such surveillance is not per se actionable.

see Donanoe v. Duling, 330 F. Supp. 308 (E. D. Va. 1971) (police -

surveillance of street demonstrations held not to offend First Amendment

rights).

The Supreme Court in Hoffa v. U.S., 385 U.S. 293 (1966), held

that the use of secret informants is "not per se unconstitutional", and does

not violate the Fifth Amchdment privilege against self-incrimination, nor

the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and

seizures. The Court upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment,

admission at trial of evidence obnined by an undercover informant to whom

a defendant spoke without knowledge that he was in the employ of the police.

385 U.S. at 300-303. See also Lewis v. U.S., 385 U.S. 200 (1960) and

Lopez V. U.S., 373 U.S. 127 (1963).

RE: FBI AUTIIORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

Moreover,

the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Whitc, 101 U.S. 745

(1971), recently held that the use of secret informants does not violate

any constitutionally justifiable expectation of privacy under the Fourth

Amendment, even when an informant uses electronic equipment to transmit

his conversations with defendants to other agents.

If the use of undercover government informants without a

warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment and invade a defendant's

constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy, Hotla v. U.s., supra:

and such informants may write down their conversations with deiendants

and testify concerning them, or simultaneously record and transmit such

conversations to others, who may testify against them, On Lce v. U.S.,

343 U.S. 747 (1952); U.S. V. White, supra, then clearly mere visuai

"surveillance" of plaintitic in plain viow by informants at public moctngs

would not violate their constitutional rights.

It would seem that those who elect to present their views actively

in the public arena deliberately expose themselves to the public. See

Associated Press v. Walker, 388 U.S. 130 (1907). Any recording of their

activities by the deiendants does not invade their privacy any more than

does a newspaper, radio, or television story, and, indeed, much less since

any information compiled is usable and effective only through court action.

Tatum V. Laird, 444 F2d 947, 957 (D. C. Cir. 1971).

More difficult questions are presented where the investigation.

delves into the private affairs of the individuals or organizations. But

even here, the courts have generally sustained our procedures so long as

they comport with the restrictions of the Fourth, Filth and Sisth Amendments

Re:

In summary, it is premature to say that the First Amendment

line of cases, dealing with the "chilling" concept offers any substantial

impediment to our intelligence investigations. There is less reason for

optimism, however, with regard to congressional intervention. We

should be prepared,

therefore, to meet arguments regarding the need

for outside supervision. The sound answer, which should satisfy

governmental needs and individual rights, is found in tight internal

controls and carefully developed guidelines.

Espionage and Foreign Intclligence Investigations

The mission of the FBI In the

foreign intelligence

fiold is one of counterintelligence. The objectives and

priorities of counterintelligence have been variously stated

and evaluated. Generally, these objectives may be listed in

doclining priority as follows: (2) the detection and

identification of intelligence operations and agonts;

(2) the penetration of these operations for the purpose

of control aud the development of intollizence infornation;

(3) neutralization of hostile intelligence operations through

disruption and disinformation; and, (4) prosecution. Wriever

the assigned priority, the overall objeciive is to dony access

to information sought by whatover practical means ae available.

Foreign intelligence investigations are grounded in

the Espionage statute and related laws including the Registra

Lion and Atomic Energy Acts. Individual investigations are

initiated usually on the basis of & known or suspected connec

t10n with a foreign Intelligence service, foreign country or

subversive organization with such concctions. Since these

Investigutions emanate from various sensitive sources and.

involve special considerations, extensive criteria and

•Limitations are defined and enumerated in current instructions.

In general terms, the governing criteria are desiened

to preclude initiation and continuance of investigations which

are not justified. The limitations are designed to control

the

scope of investigation in order to insure secuiity of out

Interests through close supervisory scrutiny.

'ECOME OF ODI JUISMICTION

ANDKUTHORUTY INDO IRSTIC

INTEILIGDICE NVISDGATIONS

August 7, 1973

During our mecting on July 25, 1973, you referred to a discussion

you had with Schator Charles IcC. Kathias, dr., of Maryland during your con-

firmation hearings as to the statutory authority of the FBl and the Department of

Justico in the lield ol' donestic intriligence investigations. You then arlied

Me. Wiltiom D. Luckclhous to work with the fBI in weighing the pros and cons

with rogard to statutory authority in this arca. I mentioned that research was

touch with fir. Ruckelchaus with regard to this lanter when we have comploted

the ronalts of our concidoration and findings within the FBI.

Actually, a study has been going on in the FBI for more than two

rears as to the scope cf ful jurisdiction and authority in comestic intolligence

invostigations. When Mr. I. Patrick Gray, Ill, wes designated as Acting

Directus of the FBI, he instrueted that a position paper be propared concern-

ing the jurisdiction and authority of the Fbl to conduct domestic intelligence

investigations. A position paner was prepared which in essence stated that

authority of the Fill in this field is bused on legislative enectients, even

thougli we may have publicly relicd heavily on Presidential directives as the

basis for such authority. I'. Gray ordered an in-depth study made of the

position and in August, 1972, a detailed report was furnished to him. The

following is a summary of that report.

Over a period of several months there were a number of public

statements questioning authority and jurisdiction of the FBl to conduct domestic

intelligence-lype invecticutions, particularly where there is no clear-cut

legislative authority apparent. One of the most searching inquirics wes con-

tained in a paper presented by Prolessor John I. Plug el a twe-day conicience

at Princeton University in October, 1371, sponsored by the (omnittee for Public

Justice.

even unmounced nat he intemped to prcpose logicialion to prohiuit the 2bl

from investigating ony persor without that individual's consent, unless the

Government hes zeuson to bolicre that percon bas committed a crime or is

about to commit e crime. Other Congresemen indicated a similar interest

in fit investicative activities.

Our study revealed that the FBI had declared publicly over a

long period of time that its ze-ponsibilities in the domestic intelligunce field

are authorized under legisluéiva enactments, Presidential directives, and

instructions oi the Attorney Coneral. The Presidential directives are obviously

the i) directivé dated Sepicmber&, 1989, and reiterated January &, 1943;

July 24, 1050; end Decembor i5, 1905, and 2) Esccutive Order 10450 dated

April 27, 1953 (and amendec bui not yet implemented by Executive Order

11605 dated July 2, 1971) •

In curofully anslyzing the lnnguege of the first dircotive, dated

September 0, 1939, and considering that the subsoquent directives are all

hinged on that one, we believe that there is a misconception as to the extent

of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the Fll by those dircetives. It

appears that while the 1939 directive fixed responsibility on the FDI to handle

espionage, sabotage, and noutrolity matters, it did not convey any authority

or jurisdiction which the Fil did not alrowdy have from legislative enactments.

It is ditficult to roud into this directive or in any of those which follorred any

authority to conduct intelligence-type investigutions which would or could

not be conducied under an umbrella of legislative enactments.

requirement from the Prosident es to tho rature and type of intoiligence data

the rationale is nevertheless valid ind when scrutinized closoly, the language

Government thereunder; and

"Whercas there have been continuing unlawful acts of violence

perpetrated against the Government of the united States on against citizens

of the United States or against persons entitled to the protection of the

United States thereby endangering the domostic tranquility, threatening the

commor doiense, and jeopardiring the gendral welfare of the people of the

United States; and

"Whereas the Congress has enacted laws prohibiting acts such as

of civil rights, and conopiracies to commit such acts; and

"Whercas the President of the United States as Chief Executive

in the maintenance of the Government thereundor must have intelligence

information for appropriate decisions in the discharge of his constitutionally

Imposed responsibilities;

"Now by authority vested in me by the Conctitution and statutes

of the United States and in the interest of orderly opcration of this Government

and in furthsrance of the domestic tranquility, common defense, and general

welfare of the people of the United States it in ordered that;

"The Attorney General prepare and issuc guidelines, conforming

to the principles of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and outlining the

necessury direction, coordination, and guidance of investigations to assure

that the Federal Bureau of Investigation provides on a continuing basis

intelligence information essential to the exccution of laws pertaining to sub-

versive activity and other such activity affecting the national security,

domestic tranquility, and gencral welfare of the United States."

The Nation has been going through a time of terror. The concept

of urban guerrilla torrorism has been adopied by various extremiat elements

in the United States. Bombings of public buildings and national institutions;

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 63

## Page 64

The Attorney General

killing of police officers who, by their unitorm, are a symbol of the democratic

establishment; hijacking of aircrait in furthelance of revolutionary novemonts;

terrorist assaults on foreign diplomatic porsonnel and establishments; and opon

decluraticn of war on our form of government are only a few of the violent acts

which have been perpetruted by domestic subversives who seek io destroy or

seriously cripple our Government. Terrocist guerrilla attacks which were

once confined to far away pluses und reluied to problems oi no immediate con-

cern of our's are now possible in this country. Forcign terrorist groups in

collusion with domestic terrorists have laid plans for on airport massacre of

the type which rocently occurred in Isracl. Other foreign terrorist clements

have laid plans for terrorist attucks on American soil. Aiready oue foreign

officini has been assassinated, possibly by terrorists.

It would be folly to adopt an investigative policy based on

the concept of investigation only when there is roason to believe a erima

invoiving the national security has been committed. The IBI must

obviously anticipate the crimes dcscribed bove. We believe that in

order for the Government to be in position to defend itself against revolu-

tionary and terrorist efforts to destroy it, the FBI must have sufficient

investigative authority to conciuct intelligence-type investigations not

normally associated with enforcement of the statutes. In other words we

think the President has the inhorent Executive power to expand by further

defining the FEI's investigarive authority to enable it to develop advance

information concerning the plans and aspirations of terrorists and revolu-

tionaries who seek to overthrow or destroy the Government. However, we

also believe that such expanded authority must be formally set forth in an

Executive order and that this recommendation is responsive in the Attorney

General's expressed interest in laying more formal guidelines to our work

in areas where dofinition is not now clear.

We consider the issuance of a new Exccutive order delineating

our jurisdiction, authority, and responsibility to gather and report intclligence

information relating io the national security to be a very importaut and high

priority matter. We believe the issuance of guidelines by the Attorney Genoral

under Title 28, Section 533, United States Code, to be equally important.

DATE: NOV .1: 1971

This is in response to: your memoranda, entitled as above,

dated lay 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy

Attorney. General, Criminal Division, and referring to pro-

blems which have arisen as a result öf the promulgation of

Executive Order 11785 which amends Executive Order 10450. In

view of the involvement of my staff in these matters, I vill

undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the

criminal Division.

As you know this matter has been under continuing review

both in the Task Force, chaired by a representative of this

office, of working level representatives of various agencies

in the

security field and is now under study to a lesser degree

an Project #10 of the

"Domestic Council on Privacy".

You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instruc-

tions to the Bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations

to identify and determine the activities of organizations now.

described in the amended Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Oider

10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau in ini-

tiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter

pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and spécifically, criteria to

be utilized in determining whether available information is a

sufficient basis for investigation.

Under the amendment to Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order

20450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those

which

unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts

of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their

rights under the constitution or laws of the United States or

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 66

---

## Page 67

any State, (2) or which scek to overthrow the Government of

the United States, or any State or subdivision thereof, by

unlawful means: (Emphasis added).

Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate

that the investigation should be initially based on a possiole

violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute

prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful

act of force or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to

detoci organizations with a potential of the above nature, it

is importani that tie

investigation proceed on the basis of in-

formation indicating thai the oiganization may be of the natuse

mentionea. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the

investigation is initiated, but. only that a reasonable evaluation

of the available information suggests that the activities of the

organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The

most recent example of the type of organization,

that you have

advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated •

to violence, Symbionese Liberation Army (SIA). Organizations. of

this naturc would cieariy lall within the Order and should se

investigated as soon as infonnation is available indicating their

potentiality for violence

and of course, if possible, prior to

the fulfillment of their purposes.

It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior

communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations

and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the

investigations of such organizations if their programs call for:

acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the com-

mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these

programs.

It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the

initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling

within the Order but once the investigation reaches a stage that

offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in.

nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investi-

gation suggests a'determination that the organization is engagea

in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should

continue.

' It follows in answer to your second question that individ-

vals who are active either as members of or as affiliates of

2

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 67

## Page 68

izations described above should be investigated when

mation is rcceived indicating their involvement. The

yardstick indicated above for organizations in deter-

ling wiether the investigation should continue, should apply

corning individuals and when a determination can reasonably

e made that the individuals activities, either within the

oganization or as an individual, do not appear to be in vio

lation of any law, then the investigation should cease.

BASIS FOR FBI NATIONAL

SECURITY INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

On July 31, 1972, the Intelligence Division issued

a position paper which in effect drew the conclusion that the

FBI has the responsibility to conduct whatever investigations

are necessary to determine if statutes relating to espionage,

sabotage, insurrection or rebellion, sedition, seditious

conspiracy, advocacy

of overthrowing the Government and

other such crines affecting the national security have been

violated. In carrying out this responsibility, the FBI has

tho authority to undertake investigation prior to the actual

commitment of such a crine to determine if groups or

Individuals are engaging in activities which 1f uninterrupted

could result in a violation of a specific statute. . The

position paper noted that the FBI had declared publicly

over a long period of time that Its responsibilities in the

donestic intelligence field were authorized under legislative

enactnents, Presidental directives, and instructions of the

Attorney Goneral. The Presidential dircotives cited were

those of September. 6, 1939, and three subsequent ones of

January 8, 1943, July 21, 1950, and December 15, 1953, which

roitcrated the dircctive of september 6, 1939. It was stated

that It was belloved there was a misconception as to the

extent of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the FBI bY

NW 54969 Docld:32989720- Page 72

---

## Page 73

these directives. It was said that it appeared that while

the 1939 directive fixed-responsibility on the FBI to handle

espionage, sabotage and neutrality matters it did not convey

any authority or jurisdiction which the FBI did not already

have from legislative enactments.

The position paper was forwarded to former Acting

Director Gray but no action was taken with respect to it.

Following the appodntment of Mr. lelley as Director of the

FBI, on August 7, 1973, the results of the study were called

to the attention of the Attorney General by letter and it

was suggested to him that an executive order be prepared which

would in effect establish definitive guidelines which it was

felt had been theretofore unclear.

Subsequently on August 24, 1973, at the request

of the Department, we furnished to MI. Milliam D. Ruckelshaus,

the Deputy Attorney General Designate, a copy of the position

paper together with a copy of Section 87 of our manual in

which new guidelines had been promulgated to assure. that the

field thereafter predicated investigations in the internal

security area of our operations on specific statutes.: The new

manual section had been issued and went Into effect during

August, 1973.

The copies of the position paper and our new Section

87, of the Manual of Instructions, were returned to us by

• the Departnent without comment. On Septenber 12, 1973, the

Attorncy General stated. that he thought it would be premature

to Iccommend to the President that an executive order be

Issued until "we were fairly certain in our own minds as to

how much should be and can be accomplished at each level of

delegation." There has been no followup from the Department

with regard to the Attorney General's statements as of this

time.

On June 1 and 5, 1974, Assistant Director W. R.

, Wannall and former Inspector Thomas J. Smith of the Intelligence

Division appeared before the Committee on Internal Security

House of Representatives (Ichord Committee). The results

of their testimony are set forth in a publication entitled

"Domestic Intelligence Operations for Internal Security

Purposes Part I." Pertinent portions of this testimony

appear on pages 3571 through 3574 and on page 3591. These

sessions of the connittee were under the direction of

Mr. Alfred M. Nittle, Legislative Counsel of the Conmittee,

and he propounded most of the questions.

Referring to the directive of september 6, 1939,

Mr. Nittle said, "Now for the purpose of carrying out that

directive, has the Attorney General by standing and general

orders now in effect instructed the FBI as to precisely

what investigative work is to be enoraced within the expression

'subversive activities?""

3

sia

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 74

## Page 75

In responding to the question, Wannall read into

the record a strictly confidential memorandum dated

September 10, 1936, prepared by former Director Hoover for

MI. E. A. Tamm, Associato Dircator. In the memorandur,

Mr. Hoover referred to a conversation he had had that day

during which ir. Hoover briefed the Attorney General with regard

to a conference he had had with the President on September 1,

1936, during which the Secretary of State was present and

requested Mr. Hoover as the representative of the Department

of Justice "to have investigation made of the subversive

activities in this country, including connunism and facism."

The memorandum shows that the Attorney General verbally

directed

Mr. Hoover to proceed with this investigation and

to coordinate, as the President suggested, information upon

these matter's in the possession of the Military Intelligence

Division and the Naval Intelligence Division. In effect,

this constituted a standing and general order to the FBI fron

the Attorney General with regard to the Presidential directive.

of September 6, 1939. While the Attorney General's order pre-

ceded the September 6, 1939, directive by some three years,

It has never been abrogated and the manner in which it:

relates to the order of 1939 will be explained hereinafter.

MI. Nittle then pointed out that he saw no specific

reference to statutes which would show basis for the FBI to

: Investigate subversive activities. It was explainca to him

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 - Page 75

---

## Page 76

...

that prior to the issuance of MI. Hoover's September 10, 1936,

menorandum he had had meetings

at the thite llousc, one of

which included the Secretary of State, and Mr. Hoover had

Insisted that the Secretary of State request that the FBI

conduct investigations relating to subversive activities,

including connunism and facism, since under Title 28, Section

533, U. S. Code, the Attorney General is authorized to instruct

the FBI to conduct such other investigations as are required

by the Secretary of State in carrying out his authority.

Later during the testimony, Mt. Nittle pointed out that it

was his assumption that at least one of the bases for the

President's authority

• for issuing the directive of September 6,

1939, was his constitutional duty to protect and defend the

Constitution and that it was adequate to lend support to the

Federal investigative jurisdiction without reference to any

statutes. It was acknowledged that the fBI does not question

the Constitutional power of the President to delegate

Investigative jursidiction.

Following his appearance before the Ichord.

Committee, Wannall undertook personally to conduct research to

determine if there is a basis for concluding that FBI intelli-

gence investigations are in fact based upon a delegation of

authority under the President's Constitutional powers. This

course was pursued for the following icasons:

- 5 =

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 76

## Page 77

I. In testimony before the Appropriations

Committees, It. Hoover had consistently stated that the FBI's

responsibilities in the domestic intelligence field are auth-

orized under legislative enactments, Presidential directives

and instructions of the Attorney General. He said they include

Investigative jurisdiction over matters relating to espionage,

counterespionage, sabotage, treason, sedition, subversion

and related internal security functions. He pointed out that

subjects of investigation included the Communist Party USA,

Communist Front Groups and other totalitarian organizations

Including individuals or groups who are alleged either to

seck the overthrow the Government of the United States by

force or violence or to conspire against the rights of citi-

zens. He further stated the FBI has primary responsibility

for Investigating matters of these types in the United States,

Puerto Rico and

the Virgin Islands. Following his testimony,

the Congress consistently appropriated funds to permit the

FBI to carry out investigations in these areas.

•2. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin C.

Karoney of the Criminal Divison of the Department made

appearances before the Ichord Conmittee: on February 20, April

1

and April 2, 1971. His testimony as recorded on pages 3366

and 3439 of the publication "Domestic Intelligence Operations

for Internal Security Purposes Part I" contained statements

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 77

---

## Page 78

bearing on this subject matter. For example, after MI. Nittle

had referred to the September 6, 1939, Presidential airective

and the subsequent ones, li. Nittle asked if he regarded the

directive as embracing within its terms a requirement that the

FBI also take charge of investigative work of subversive

activities generally. Mr. Maroney said that he thought it did

generally direct the FBI to take charge of investigation of

versive activities and, "

...I think through the years what was

embraced through that condition was, in various executive orders,

and in other directives of the Attorney General relating to civil

disturbance matters." On page 3439, Mr Maroney is reported to

have discussed investigations in the internal security area

conducted by the FBI.. He stated that in connection with

particular Investigations

after a period of tine or after an

accumulation of information the FBI submits the information

to the Departnent and the Department will give an opinion

as to whether the facts constitute a prosecutable violation

and will also advise whether additional or continual investi-

gation is requested. Maroney stated, "Sometimes it will be

Indicated no further investigation is desired. However,

If any relevant future information comes to your attention,

please advise.'" Mr. Nittle then inquired if it. Haroney

was telling him in effect that not only are these investigations

being conducted but that he construed the Attorney General's

• directive to be a directive to the FBI to conduct broad,

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 78

---

## Page 79

on-going Investigations with respect to subversive activities.

Mr. Maroney roplied that' he thought they (FBI) are under a con-

tinuing mandate of the Attorney General to continue

investigations of crines which include seditious conspiracy

anti-riot statutes and many other statutes.

3. In our position paper of July 31, 1972, the

conclusion was drawn that no additional investigative

authority was conveyed in the first paragraph of the

September 6, 1939, Presidential directive wherein the

FBI vas instructed to take charge of investigative work

in matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and violationg

of the neutrality regulations. Since these were statutory

matters, the position was taken and, I feel correctly, that

this direction nerely fixed responsibility in the FBI to

Investigate previously existing statutes. However, the

position paper did not take into consideration the gossible

significance of the last paragraph of the directive wherein

the President called upon "all police officers, sheriffs,

and all other law enforcement officers in the United States

promptly to turn over to the nearest representative of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation any information obtained by

them relating to espionage, countcrespionage, sabotage,

subversive activitics and violations of the neutrality laws."

As noted hereinbefore, Mr. Hoover

in his memorandum

of September 10, 1936, wherein he explained that the FBI had

been charged with investigating subversive activities indicated

that the memorandum was classified strictly confidential.

On June 26, 1939, the President issued a directive

which was classified confidential. In it he stated, "It is my

desire that the investigation of all espionage, counterespionage

and sabotage natters be controlled and handled by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice, the Military

Intelligence Division of the War Department and the Office of

Naval Intelligence of the lavy Department. The directors

of these three agencies are to function as a conmittee to

coordinate their activitles." He went on to point out that no

investigation should be conducted by any investigative agency

of the Government into matters involving actually or potentially

any espionage, counterespionage or sabotage except these

three agencies and the directive, which was issued to these heads

of all departments, stated that the President would be glad

if the heads of tho departments would instruct agencies other

than the three named to immediately refer to the nearest

office of the r'BI any data, information or material relating.

to these matters.

•

The directive of September 6, 1939, was not

classifiod. It was issued to the public. In it the President

said the Attorney General had been requested to instruct the

## Page 81

FBI to take charge of investigative work in matters relating to

espionage, sabotage and violations of the neutrality regu-

Lations.

It was in this"paragraph that the President

publicly fixed responsibility for investigative work with

respect to statutes relating to these three subject matters

in the FBI. However, in the third paragraph of the.

September 6, 1939, directive the President stated, "To this

end I request all police officers, sheriffs and all other

law enforcement officers in the United States promptly to

turn over to the nearest representative of the Federal

Bureau of Invesigation any information obtained by them

relating to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, subversive

activitios and violations of the neutrality laws." It will

be noted that in this paragraph he referred specifically to

violations of three statues which he had enunerated in the

flist paragraph but he also asted that there be turned over to

the FBI any Information relating to countorespionage a word

which he had utilized in the confidential June 26, 1939,

directive and also the words subversive activities a phrase

which had been utilized by MI. Hoover in explaining the

delegation of authority in September, 1936.

Mr. Hoover's nemorandum had been classified strictly confi-

dential and memoranda concerning his visits with President

Roosevelt and the Secretary of State which preceded the

Issuance of his September 10, 1936, memorandum revealed that

the PIcsident wanted this matter treated in the greatest

of confidence. Accordingly, there is the basis for a

strong conclusion that in 1936 and in June, 1939, under his

constitutional authority, the President had already delegated

responsibility to the FBI for investigations relating to

counterespionage and subversive activities in classified

directives. For this reason, the first paragraph of the

Septenber 6, 1939, directive did not include the delegation

of responsibilities for investigative work relating to

counterespionage and subversive activities because of the

classified nature of these matters but there was an acknow-.

Lodgement in the third paragraph of the September 6, 1939,

directive of the previous delegation of authority to the FBI

by the President in these two areas.

since the June 26, 1939, directive indicated that the

FBI and the Har and Navy Departments should function as a

committee to coordinate their activities with respect to

investigations of espionage, counterespionage and sabotage

matters, Wannall requested the Research Section of the

Intelligence Division three weeks ago to undertake a study to

determine how this committce was formed and how it functioned

thereafter.

The results of this study are set forth in

the

attached 35-page paper.

On page

T of the attachment; it will be noted

that the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IIC)

was formed as an independent cormittee pursuant to the Presidential

directive of June 26, 1939, to coordinate the investigative

efforts of the three agencies. To faciliate coordination, the

IIC adopted the Delinitations Agrcement of June 5, 1940.

The members cited in the preamble of that document that in

conformity with that directive contained in the Presidential

memorandum of June 26, 1939, as augumented by his directive

of September 6, 1939, charging them with investigation of all

espionage, counterespionage, sabotage and subversive

activities the responsibility for these investigations would

be delineated as contained in the agreement. The Delimi-

tations

on February 23, 1949.

As shown on page g of the attachment, the IIC as

an independent committee ceased to exist in 1919 as pursuant

to the National Security Act of 1947 it was absorbed and then

chartered by the National Security Council presided ovcr by

the President. In the charter, referance was made to investi-

gations of donestic espionage, counterespionage, sabotage,

subversion and other rclated Intelligence matters affecting

Internal security.

Page 10 of the attachment clates that supervision

of the IIC was transferred by the National Security Council

to the Attorney General in an Action Memorandum dated June 9,

1962. On March 5, 1961, the Attorney General issued

Instructions to the FBI wherein the Attorney General was

Indicated as the individual through whom the authority flowed

as opposad to the National Security Council. In a memorandum

to former Director Hoover explaining this dated March 5, 1964,

the Attorney General again referred to the coordination of

all Investigations of domestic espionage, counterspionage,

sabotage, and subversion and other related intelligence

matters affecting internal security

A reading of the enclosure will show that the

_IIC

was primarily concerned with matters of internal security

which had ramifications international in scope. However,

It should be noted that on November 1, 1950, an attempt was

made to kill President Truman by two members of the

Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico when they endeavored to

shoot their way into the Blair House which he was then

occupying. From a letter to Mir. Hoover as Chairman of the IIC

and Mi. Raymond P. Whearty, Chairman of the Interdepartmental

Committee on Internal Security, dated November 6, 1950, signed

by MI. J. Patrick Coyno, National Security Council Representa-

tive for Internal Security, It is apparent that the President

- 13 ..

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 84

## Page 85

felt that both the IIC and ICIS had interests and Icspon-

sibilities In the domestic terrorist field, in light of the

fact that he, through the

National Security Council, made

inquiry of the IIC regarding "the recent outbreal of violence

by the Puerto Rican Mationalists." The President requested

that the IIC and ICIS report to the National Security Council

on the lessons to be learned from that incident on donestic

terrorism. Indicated by the detailed questions posed by the

president and the detailed response given.by the IIC, It is

apparent that the President intended that IIC have gicat

latitute in the area of subversive activities and terrorism

as it relates to internal security matters assigned to the

IIC.

Keeping in mind that it was during the admini-

stration of President Truman and based upon recormendations

that he made that the National Security Act of 1947 was

passed, I feel that his reguest of the IIC for a report

regarding the activities of a purely domestic group, the

• Natlonalist Party of Puerto Rico, provides an indication of

what he had in mind with respect to the responsibilities.

of the IIC with regard to investigation of subversive

activities.

I think this is well stated on page 14 of the enclosed

document. "Men do not operate in a vacuum and their acts and

documents are guided by their knowledge, instructions and

• 14 -

NW: 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 85

## Page 86

understanding of instructions at that time in history. The

delimitations agreement of 1940 must, therefore, speak to

existing problems and only the anticipation of future prob

lems. All prior knowledge and understanding of instructions

and orders could only have been interpreted to clearly

include investigation of United States citizens."

The foregoing information and the information con-

tained in the attachments are supportive of the conclusion

that the intelligence-gathering activities of the FBI have had

as their basis the intention of the President to delegate his

Constitutional authority as indicated by certain Presidential

directives, the provisions of Title 28, Section 533, U. S. Couc

and the provisions of the national Secuxity Act of 1947. These

intelligence-gathering activities are also based upon statutes

defining violations pertaining to the national security, a

list of which is attached hereto.

Synopsis;

:

Oral and written, confidential and public Directives of 1936 and

in June and September, 1939, ordered the FBI to investigate matters of internal

security, to include "subversive activitics," and to coordinate such with the

military intelligence services. In compliance, the FBI and military formed the

Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IC) and delineated their areas of

investigative responsibility in the Delimitations Agreements of 1940, 1942, and

1949, basing their authority on the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, 'as

augmented by the Directive of September 6, 1939. The Delimitations Agreement

stated that the FBI will investigate matters affecting internal security, including

United States citizens. This authority for intelligence investigation was restated

and reaffirmed in 1949 when the National Security Council, presided over by

the President, chartered the IIC and adopted the Delimitations Agreement in

total. In 1962, the President assigned the internal security responsibility

to the Attorney General by National Security Action Memorandum 161. The

Attorney General rechartered the IIC pursuant to this authority and therein

reaffirmed the Directives by adoption in total of the Delimitations Agreement.

Pursuant to the Directives, the FBI has had continuous authority.

to conduct intelligence investigations of internal activities which have potential

to subvert the ability of the Nation to maintain continuing existence under the

Constitution. (Emphasis Added) This authority has remained constant though

the nature of the threats has changed. As illustrated hercin by use of examples,

• NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 89

the original problem was global war and how internal subversion affected the

war effort through actual or potential espionage and sabotage. This problem

continued through the Cold War to the present time. In more recent years, a

strictly domestic threat arose; riots, racial militants, hate groups, and terrorists.

Cognizant of the continuing authority for intelligence investigations, these

threats were faced by the FBI not only because of the immediate effect on the

national welfare or possible violation of statute but the evaluation of potential

for subversion during a national emergency.

This authority for intelligence investigation in the field of internal

security precipitated the dual role of the FBI as it exists today; (1) intelligence,

and (2) criminal investigations. This has been recognized by the Executive,

the Attorney General, and the Congress.

in addition to the authority granted under the Directives, the FBI

has (1) a broad field of statutory authority, and (2) authority under Executive

Orders to investigate employee loyalty matters; neither of which is in any way

affected by the authority granted under the Directives.

In summary, the Directives granted intelligence authority and

placed the FBI in an internal security intelligence posture, in addition to the

original statutory responsibility in the investigation of solely criminal matters.

AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BY THE

PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVES IN THE AREA OF

INTELLIGENCE AND INTERNAL SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

AND SUBSEQUENT PERTINENT DOCUMENTS

I. Verbal Presidential instructions of August 24, 1936, and August 25, 1936:

Verbal instructions were given to Director John Edgar Hoover

by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on August 24, 1936, and August 25, 1936,

to investigate "subversive activities in the United States, including Fascism

and Communism," and "to coordinate any investigation along similar lines

which might be made by the Military or Naval Intelligence Services."

(Emphasis Added) President Roosevelt saw these activities "as international

in scope" and advised the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, to request "such

investigation" under the Appropriations Act (Title 28, Section 533, United States

Code), which was done orally as the President wished the matter to be "handled

quite confidentially." President Roosevelt instructed Mr. Hoover and

Secretary Hull to speak with the Attorney General "upon his return to the city"

about this matter. The discussion of August 24 and 25, 1936, covered the

area of communist and fascist "movements" in the United States and President

Roosevelt was interested in obtaining

• "a broad picture" of the movement and

activities "as may affect the economic and political life of the country as a

whole." (Confidential memoranda, John Edgar Hoover, dated August 24,

1936 and August 25, 1936.)

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 91

## Page 92

On September 10, 1936, Mr. Hoover advised the Attorney General

regarding "the radical situation" and his conference with the President

and Secretary of State, wherein he acted as the representative of the

Department of Justice, and wherein the request was made "to have investi-

gation made of the subversive activities in this country, including

Communism and Fascism." (Emphasis Added) The Attorney General

orally directed Mr. Hoover to "proceed with this investigation and to

coordinate, as the President suggested, information upon these matters in

the possession of the Military Intelligence Division, Naval Intelligence

Division, and the State Department. This, therefore, is the authority upon

which to proceed in the conduct of this investigation, which should, of

course, be handled in a most discreet and confidential manner." (Memorandum

for Mr. Tamm, strictly confidential, from John Edgar Hoover, dated

September 10, 1936.)*

It is noted and emphasized that, throughout the memoranda,

Mr. Hoover referred on a recurring basis to "subversive activities, in-

cluding communism and fascism" and the overall gist of the conversations

as reflected in the memoranda demands the understanding that this

authority was granted for a widespread and diverse look at all subversive

activities within the United States. It should not be overlooked that the

United States was then on the brink of global war and, of necessity,

information regarding subversive activities of all manner were of vital

importance to the President and Seeictary of State.

II. The Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, a confidential Directive:

"It is my desire that the investigation of

..

all espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage

matters be controlled and handled by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation of the

• Department of Justice, the Military Intel-

ligence Division of the War Department, and

the Office of Naval Intelligence of the Navy

Department. The directors of these three

agencies.are to function as a committee to

coordinate their activities.

-9 .

No investigations should be conducted by

any investigative agency of the Government into

matters involving actually or potentially any

espionage, counterespionage, or sabotage,

except by the three agencies mentioned above.

I shall be glad if you will instruct the heads

of all other investigative agencies than the three

named, to refer immediately to the nearest office

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation any data,

information, or material that may come to their

notice bearing directly or indirectly on espionage,

counterespionage, or sabotagc." (Emphasis Added)

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 93

:: 20.

## Page 94

In the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, President

Roosevelt clearly and unequivocably ordered that "the investigation of all

espionage, counterespionage, sabotage matters" be handled by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation, Military Intelligence Division (MID), and Office of

Naval Intelligence (ONI) and that their directors were to act as committee

to coordinate their activities. This is unquestionably delegation of investi-.

gative authority for Bureau investigations of the enumerated areas of activity

to the exclusion of other agencies, save the MID and ÖNI. In the second

paragraph, the Directive also clearly and unequivocably states the President's

intent to have investigation made of actual or potential espionage, counter-

espionage or sabotage as he directs no other agency to enter the field of

actual or potential espionage, counterespionage or sabotage investigations.

(Emphasis Added) On the contrary, in paragraph three, he directs other

agencies to "refer immediately" to the FBI any data, information or material

bearing directly or indirectly on espionage, counterespionage, or sabotage.,

If such matters are to be referred to the FBI, the President's intent obviously

is that he desired the FBI to "control and handle" the correlation of such

material as reflected in paragraph one of the Directive and as he had pre-

viously verbally instructed Mr. Hoover to do in 1936, in other words, to

coordinate any investigation with the military

Reflecting back to the verbal Directives of August, 1936, as

compared to the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, it is noted that two

major premises can be made, one being the intent of the President for the

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 94

---

## Page 95

FBI to investigate "subversive activity, including Communism and Fnscism,"

an area of concern akin to and overlapping in many respects the area of

espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage; and secondly, his intent that

the FBI and Military Services coordinate their efforts of investigation as

assigned by these Directives. (Emphasis Added)

III. The Presidential Directive of September 6, 1939, a public Directive:

"The Attorney General has been requested by me

to instruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the

Department of Justice, to take charge of investigative

work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and

violations of the neutrality regulations.

This task must be conducted in a comprehensive

" and effective manner on a national basis, and all

information must be carefully sifted out and correlated

in order to avoid confusion and irresponsibility.

To this end I request all police officers, sheriffs,

and all other law enforcement officers in the United States

promptly to turn over to the nearest representative of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation any information obtained

by them relating to. espionage, counterespionage, sabotage,

subversive activities and violations of the neutrality

laws." (Emphasis Added)

- 5 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 95

---

## Page 96

Interpreting the Presidential intent in this Directive, a public

document, it must be first noted that in the first sentence the President states

"the Attorney General has been requested by me to instruct the Federal Bureau

of Investigation of the Department of Justice to take charge of investigative

work in matters relating to espionage, sabotage, and violations of the neutrality

regulations." (Emphasis Added) The use of the past tense requires one to

understand that the President, through prior instructions and Directives,

oral or written, had, to his own satisfaction, specifically delegated responsi-

bility for these investigations. The President restates publicly the need for

handling of these matters comprehensively and on "a national basis." He

restates matters previously covered in verbal and written form by expressing

his desire to have the information "sifted out and correlated." One need only

refer to the verbal instructions of 1936 and the confidential Presidential

Directive of June 26, 1939, to clearly see that the main intent of the President

is here again reflected, only in this instance, publicly, and with an appeal for

assistance from law officers.

Further, and a point believed worthy of note, the President

instructs in this Directive that law officers in the United States remand to

the FBI information relating to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage,

subversive activities, and violations of the neutrality laws. Emphasis

Added) Carefully note that the President included in this request that

information regarding subversive activitics be turned over to the FBI as

in

= 6 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 96

---

## Page 97

well as information involving espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, and

violations of the neutrality laws. This is the precise language of the verbal

Directive or instruction of August, 1936, and it is logical that if the President

instructed Mr. Hoover to investigate subversive activities in 1936, he would

desire that information regarding subversive activities be furnished to the FBI

by law officers in his public Directive of September 6, 1939, in order to

increase and enhance the tempo of incoming information regarding subversive

activities in which he had a grave interest. (Emphasis Added)

.. i:

IV. The Presidential Directives of January 8, 1943, July 24, 1950; and December 15,

1953, in main, restate and reaffirm these basic instructions and orders based

on then current developments at the time of their respective issuances.

.V. How has the FBI complied with the verbal instructions of August, 1936, and

confidential Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, as augmented by his

Directive of September 6, 1939, and what other Presidential documents reaffirm

subsequent Presidential approval of this investigative authority?

A.

Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IC):

The Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IIC) was formed

as an independent committee pursuant to the Presidential Directive of June 26,

1939, to coordinate the investigative efforts of the FBI, MID, and ONI. To

facilitate coordination, the IIC adopted the Delimitations Agreement of June 5,

1940. The members cited in the preamble of that document that in conformity.

with the Directive contained in the Presidential Memorandum of June 26, 1939,

- 7 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 97

...

## Page 98

as augmented by his Directive of September 6, 1939, charging them with

investigation of all espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, and subversive

activities, that responsibility for these investigations would be delineated

as contained in the Agreement. (Emphasis Added)

It is apparent that the members of IIC recognized their authority

from the Presidential Memorandum of June 26, 1939, and that their duty

under that Directive was to investigate the aforementioned areas, including

subversive activities, as Mr. Hoover had been directed to do in August, 1936.

(Emphasis Added)

The IIC in issuing the revised Delimitations Agreement of February 9,

1942, again cited the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, as augmented by

the Directive of September 6, 1939, as authority. IIC members stated in the

preamble that investigative responsibility of IIC extended to "all activities

coming under the categories of espionage, counterespionage, subversion,

and sabotage." (Emphasis Added)

The Agreement was redrafted in the Delimitations Agreement of

February 23, 1949, and again the members in the preamble cited the

Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, as augmented by his Directive of

September 6, 1939, the Delimitations Agreement of February 9, 1942, and the

Presidential Directive of October 30, 1947 (pertaining to employee loyalty

investigations), as authority. As before, the IIC members referred specifically

to the delincation of responsibility of investigation of "all activities coming

undcr the categories of espionage, counterespionage, subversion, and sabotage."

(Emphasis Added)

B.

IC under the charter of the National Security Council (NSC):

The IIC as an independent committee ceased to exist in 1949, as

pursuant to the National Security Act of 1947 it was absorbed and then chartered

by the NSC, presided over the President. The Council chartered both the IC

and the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security (CIS), which consisted

of representatives of the Departments of State, Treasury, and Justice, and the

Military Establishments. *The IC charter issued by NSC dated July 18, 1949,

".

reads in part:

"Pursuant to the provision of Section 101 of the

National Security Act and NSC 17/4 as approved by the

President, the National Security Council hereby

authorizes and directs that the Indepartmental

« Intelligence Conference effect the coordination of

all investigation of domestic espionage, counter-

espionage, sabotage, subversion, and other

related intelligence matters affecting internal

security. The IIC shall be guided by the terms

of this charter.

A. ORGANIZATION

(1) The Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference

shall be constituted as set forth in the Presidential

Directive of Junc 26, 1939, that is, the Director of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Director of

the Intelligence Division of the Army, the Director

of Naval Intelligence, and in addition, the Director,

Office of Special Investigations, U. S. Air Force,

which office has been created since the issuance of

the original Presidential Directive." (Emphasis Added)

C. IIC under the charter of the Attorney Genéral:

Supervision of the IIC was transferred by National Security

Action Memorandum 161 issued by the President, John F. Kennedy, dated

June 9, 1962, which reads in part:

"(2) Accordingly, I have directed that the two

interdepartmental committees concerned with internal

:

'security--the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference

(IC) and the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal

Security (ICIS) --which have been under the supervision

of the National Security Council, will be transferred to

the supervision of the Attorney General. The continuing

need for these committees and their relationship to the

Attorney General will be matters for the Attorney General

to determine."

Pursuant to National Security Action Memorandum, the Attorney.

General in a memorandum to John Edgar Hoover, Chairman, IIC, dated

March 5, 1964, which, in essence, restated the IIC charter as issued by

NW 54969 Docid:32989720 Page 100

## Page 101

the NSC, with appropriate amendments, causing it to read in part:

"Pursuant to the provisions of the National

Security Action Memorandum 161, dated June 9;

1962 from the President, the Attorney General hereby

authorizes and directs that the Interdepartmental

Intelligence Conference effect the coordination of all

investigation.of domestic espionage, counterespionage,

sabotage and subversion, and other related intelligence

matters affecting internal security. The IIC shall be

guided by the terms of this charter.

A. ORGANIZATION

(1) The Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference

"shall be constituted as set forth in the Presidential

Directive of June 26, 1939, that is, the Director of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of

Justice; Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence,

Department of the Army; Director of Naval Intelligence,

Department of the Navy; and the Director of Special

Investigations, the Inspector General, Department

of the Air Force (the latter position having been created

since the issuance of the original Presidential Dircctive.)"

(Emphasis Added)

- 11 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 101

## Page 102

It is apparent that all authority granted by NSC and the Attorney

General subsequent to the Presidential Directives of August 21-25, 1936, and

June 26, 1939, which authorized the FBI to conduct intelligence investigations

refers to those Directives and recognizes, adopts and reaffirms their instruction.

D. What are the primary areas of inquiry considered by IC in fulfilling

their responsibility? Do they include United States citizens?

A review of the voluminous files relative to IIC reflects that the

primary considerations of IIC were directed at such matters as security of

plants, protection of industry and transportation, obstruction of commerce and

vital utilities, registry of boats, security of wharfs and docks, public radio

broadcasting, alien entry and control matters, diplomatic establishment

radio authorizations, visiting foreign nationals, Communist Party, USA,

and alien seamen, to mention but a few.

Obviously, the IIC was primarily concerned with matters of

internal security which had ramifications "international in scope," as

President Roosevelt described previously herein, and this is only natural

as these were the primary problems during the heat of the Cold War of the

late 1940's to the mid-1960's. These problems continue today. Domestic

terrorism was not a problem in this country at the time, except on a very

limited basis. Mr. Hoover, when preparing proposals for the Delimitations

Agreement of June 5, 1940, suggested to the members that "subversive

activity" be understood to include "espionage, sabotage, groups organized

to assist hostile forces ("Fifth Column") and Subversive propaganda, " all

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 102

---

## Page 103

which are matters obviously pertinent to internal security challenges from

without the Nation's boundries. One primary consideration cannot be lost,

however, and that is the central fact that from the earliest verbal instructions

in 1936 through and including all other orders, the FBI, without reservation,

has been directed to "investigate," "take charge," "correlate," "sift out,"

"control," and "handle," all intelligence matters concerning the internal

security of the United States whether it be called "subversive activities,"

"subversion," "domestic espionage," "espionage," "counterespionage,".

"sabotage," or "subversion and other related intelligence matters affecting

internal security."

(Emphasis Added) Secondly, and of primary importance,

is the fact that the thrust of these investigations as ordered by the various

Directives and charters has not been limited to the alien principle or agent

operating in the United States but directed at the United States citizen when

he or she acts or functions in a manner to fall within the above terms used to

indicate a threat to the internal security. Supporting this fact is the Delimitations

Agreement of June 5, 1940, wherein the members, conforming with the Presidential

Directive of June 26, 1939, as they so state, outline their respective areas of

responsibility to investigate. Item 2 of this Agreement reads in part:

"Il. FBI will assume responsibility for all

• investigations of cases in these categories involving

civilians in the United States and in its territories

with the exception of the Panama Canal Zone, Guam,

Samoa and the Philippine Islands." (Emphasis Added)

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 103

---

## Page 104

Men do not operate in vacuum and their acts and documents are

guided by their knowledge, instructions, and understanding of instructions

at that time in history. The Delimitations Agreement of 1940 must; therefore,

speak to existing problems and only the anticipation uf future problems. All

prior knowledge and understanding of instructions and orders could only have

been interpreted to clearly include investigation of United States citizens since

Item 2 of the Agreement speaks so specifically to this point.

1. Has the Executive adopted Item 2 as set forth in the Delimitations

Agreement of 1940?

Absolutely. The Delimitations Agreement of 1940 was replaced by

the Delimitations Agreement of February 9, 1942, wherein reference for authority

• is again based on a Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, and Item 2 is

changed in language but not in meaning. Item 2 reads in part:

"II. FBI will be responsible for:

1. All investigation of cases in the

categories involving civilians in the

United States and its territories with

the exception of the Republic of Panama,

the Panama Canal Zone, Guam, American

Samoas, Palmyra, Johnston, Wake and

Midway Islands, the Philippine Islands

and the Territory of Alaska other than

that specifically described in Paragraph III."

(Emphasis Added)

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 104

## Page 105

The IIC issued the Delimitations Agreement of February 23, 1949,

again basing authority on the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939, and

again restated the position to investigate United States citizens, which is

clearly stated in Item 2, which reads in part:

"II. FBI will be responsible for:

1. All investigations of cases in these

categories involving civilians and foreign

nationals of all classes in the continental

United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin

Islands, (the State of Hawaii), and the State

of Alaska except as specifically described

hereinafter in Paragraph V, Section 5."

The Delimitations Agreement of February 23, 1949, was in effect

on July 18, 1949, when the IIC was chartered by the NSC. The President was

Chairman of the NSC. The NSC charter to IIC reads in part:

..

"D. Nothing herein shall be construed as

modifying or affecting the Presidential Directives

issued to the members of the IIC relating to their

individual responsibilities and duties. The

Delimitations Agrecment among the members of the

IIC relating to the investigative responsibilities and

duties of the individual members and other agreements

:

to be amended, changed, and supplemented at the

discretion of the IIC." (Emphasis Added)

The President herein clearly adopted the language of the Delimitations

Agreement of February 23, 1949, to include Item 2 of that Agreement, wherein

it is specifically stated the FBI will investigate United States citizens.

2. Does this adoption apply to the charter issued by the

Attorney General in 1964?

Yes. Pursuant to the authority of the National Security Action

Memorandum 161, dated June 9, 1962, from the President, the Attorney General

:

chartered the IIC and that charter reads in part:

" "D. Nothing herein shall be construed as

## Page 107

In summary, the Executive has, over the years, granted continuing

authority to the FBI to investigate matters threatening the internal security, including

investigation of private citizens of the United States and their activities.

VI. What Other Areas of Intelligence Investigation Have Been Recognized By

the Executive to Fall Within the Jurisdiction Delineated By the Directives?

Examination of the question illustrates that over the years the .

scope of internal security problems has been expanded from the original

category of "subversive activities" as described by Mr. Hoover in

his proposed definition of the term to a much broader field of intelligence

responsibility. It has been illustrated that the oral and written Directives

of 1936 and 1939 vested intelligence investigative authority in the FBI and that

this authority has been reaffirmed over the years. The authority was granted

originally to meet the problems of the 1936-1939 period and has continued

in effect to meet the problems involving internal security as they arose in

subsequent years.

Originally, the problem facing the Nation was obviously the threat

of communist and fascist espionage, sabotage, and subversive activities, acts

such as infiltration of vital functions, dissemination of propaganda, and fostering

discontent that would weaken the national fabric at a time when the Nation was

faced with global war. These concerns have grown and evolved over the years

to include domestic "hate groups," anarchists, and terrorists. The following

chronology illustrates this cvolutionary aspect of the recognized problem:

- 17 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 107

---

## Page 108

By letter to Mr. Hoover, Chairman, IIC, and Mr. Whearty, Chairman,

ICIS, dated November 6, 1950; from Mr. J. Patrick Coyne, NSC Representative

on Internal Security, it is apparent that the President felt that the IC and the

ICIS had interests and responsibilities in the domestic terrorist field in light

of the fact that he, through the NSC, made inquiry of the IIC regarding the

then recent Presidential attack by Puerto Rican nationalists. The President

requested that the IIC and the ICIS report to the NSC on the lessons to be learned

from that incident of domestic terrorism' (see App. Section I). As indicated

by the detailed questions posed by the President and the detailed response by

the IIC, it is apparent that the President intended that IIC have great latitude

in the area of investigation of subversive activity and terrorism as it relates to

internal security matters assigned to IIC.

It should be obvious that the concern of the President and referral

of this concern to the IIC and ICIS for answers affirms and illustrates the

President's atritude that such matters as domestic terrorism certainly affect,

the internal security and national welfare and are the responsibility of IIC.

• The FBI is the member of IIC charged with investigation of "subversion" under

the Delimitations Agreement of February 23, 1949. What more subversive activity

could be imagined than an armed terrorist attack on the President?

In a report to the NSC on the status of the internal security program

dated March 5, 1954, prepared jointly by the IIC and the ICIS, the scope of

intelligence investigation of internal security matters was described in connection

with outlining specific major.goals of the program:

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 108

10

---

## Page 109

"1. To coordinate the activities of all agencies and

and departments concerned with internal security matters,

including investigations, the collection of domestic

intelligence, and the integration of foreign intelligence

pertinent to the domestic intelligence field.

2. To continue the acceleration of investigations

designed to provide the basis for the apprehension,

prosecution, or other action, against persons involved

in subversive activities.

3. To detect and maintain security indices on

persons considered dangerous to the national defense

and public safety.

4. To neutralize Communist front and Communist-

dominated organizations of the United States."

It may be seen that in addition to their interests in prosecuting

statutory violations, the IIC members recognize their responsibility as assigned

by the Directives to obtain a broad-based intelligence picture regarding the

subversive potential of individuals and organizations.

In a joint status report to the NSC dated August 27, 1958, the IIC

and ICIS discussed the dual aspects of their jurisdiction. It is pointed out

that there is occasional conflicts between the prosccutive jurisdiction under

statutes which might tend to interfere with the intelligence-gathering function.

- 19 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 109

---

## Page 110

In such cases, it was noted that prosecution is frequently foregone in favor

of the more valuable collection of intelligence. The report states in part:

"Following the Supreme Court decisions reversing

the convictions of 19 Communist Party leaders for

violation of the Smith Act of 1940, action by various

Circuit Courts of Appeal has resulted in the acquittal

.. of 20 additional Communist Party functionaries and

the remanding for retrial of 29 others. While selected

cases

are not scheduled for retrial during the fiscal

year 1959, problems have arisen in other cases due

to the lapse of time since the periods covered by the

indictments. In most instances, several years have

been consumed by trials and appeals with the result

that witnesses have died, have become invalid, or

are unavailable for other reasons and at this late date

their testimony cannot be replaced. Another problem

has been the stringent evidentiary standards established

by the Supreme Court in the case of the California

communist leaders

In other cases, the Department of Justice must

consider the loss, through their appearance as witnesses,

of additional confidential informants of the FBI. It

is necessary to weigh the difficulty of developing

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 110 -

---

## Page 111

informants within the Communist Party and its related

groups together with the value of the information they

secure against the benefit to be derived from using

such persons as witnesses."

On November 6, 1958, former Director Hoover gave a presentation

to the President and the Cabinet, which reads in part:

"We have still a sixth program under which we

continuously evaluate the espionage and sabotage

potential of individuals whose current activities

indicate that they might constitute a threat to the

country in the event of a national emergency. These

include members of the Communist Party of the

United States and other individuals dedicated to

the violent overthrow of our Government. We,

maintain a special index of such persons to enable

us to effect their immediate apprehension in the event

the President so directs the Attorney General. For

your information, there were 12,835 names on this

index.

Communist Party leaders are hopeful that, by

exploiting such current national and international

issues as racial discrimination and peace., they can

- 21 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 111

---

## Page 112

bring about a resurgence of Party activity and influence.

For example, Ecnjamin Davis, chairman of the Party's

New York District, in a report made in September of

this year to top communist functionaries, stressed

that the Party should concentrate on the integration

issue as symbolized by the Little Rock school situation.

Diligent efforts are made by the communists to infiltrate

Negro groups, particularly at the local level, so as

to agitate and create confusion.

The public usually associates the FBI's internal

security investigations with Communist Party activities

only. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our

investigations encompass any and all organizations based

on a creed of force and violence to determine whether they

are a threat to our internal security or whether they have

violated any Federal laws.

We investigate the activities of such diverse and.

international organizations as the Marxist Socialist

Workers Party, and the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico. •

(Responsible for attack upon President Truman,

1950, and Congress, 1954.) Further, we investi-

gate such fanatical and so-called 'hato' groups as

the Negro Nation of Islam; the Ku Klux Klan; the

NW 54969 Docid:32989720 Page 112

---

## Page 113

National States Rights Party, an anti-Jewish and anti-

Negro organization; and the 'Confederate Underground.'

The latter is a name which has been mentioned on

a number of occasions in recent bombing threats and other'

forms of violence.

Since January 1, 1957, there have been over 90

• bombings, or attempted bombings, in the United States.

Of these, at least 69 have involved Negro victims and at

least eight, Jewish religious and educational facilities.

In the early bombings there was no evidence to show

that these bombings could be attributable to specific

organizations. Pather, they were individual acts of

terror strictly within the jurisdiction of local authorities.

When these outrages occurred, we in the FBI have made

immediately available to local authorities our laboratory

and fingerprint facilities here in Washington.

As the bombings directed toward religious and....

educational facilities continued, the FBI extended its

cooperation to cover out-of-state leads which local

authorities could not handle. We extended such

assistance to the Jacksonville, Florida, and Birmingham,

Alabama, Police Departments in connection with the

- 23 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 113

---

## Page 114

bombings of a Jcwish center and a Negro high school

in Jacksonville on April 28, 1958, and the attempted

bombing of a Jewish temple in Birmingham on the

same day.

Recently, however, there has been some indication

of a general interstate pattern to these bombings. For

example, one of the men indicted on October 17, 1958,

(Richard Bowling) for the bombing of the Jewish temple

in Atlanta, received from one of his fellow conspirators

two checks amounting to $200. One of these checks

was dated October 4, 1958, the day before the Clinton,

Tennessee, High School bombing, the other, October 9,

1958, three days before the Atlanta temple bombing.

Recognizing the danger to the national welfare from

a general pattern of organized terrorism, the FBI has moved

to expand its assistance to local law enforcement in the

recent bombings at Clinton, Atlanta, and Peoria, Illinois.

We are now providing all-out investigative assistance

in these cases. We are closely checking the activities

of individuals prominently involved in racial disturbances,

such as the notorious John Kasper, the executive

secretary of the Seaboard White Citizens Council of

Washington. As a further aid to local law enforcement

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 114

---

## Page 115

agencies, the FBI has scheduled a series of special

conferences for November and December, 1958, to

discuss our cooperative services regarding bombings

and threats of bombings against religious and educational

institutions.

Our entry into these cases at this new level is not to

be interpreted as an attempt on our part to usurp the

jurisdiction of local authorities. To give the FBI this .

jurisdiction would relieve local governments of the

basic responsibility to maintain law and order, and

the ultimate responsibility rightfully rests at the local

level."

As specifically stated by Mr. Hoover in his comments to the President

and the Cabinet, he therein delineates that there is an internal domestic aspect

to the intelligence-gathering function of the FBI and this is based on the fact that

he recognizes the danger to the "national welfare" from a general pattern of

terrorism which does, in fact, affect the internal security of the United States.:

By letter of May 17, 1961, McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to

the President, requested of the IIC and the ICIS, pursuant to Presidential wishes,

reports covering current and contemplated internal security programs which fall

within the cognizance of their respective committees. The reports were to

include such items as: description of the program and its objectives, the

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 115

- 25 -

---

## Page 116

datc of initiation, reference to the Directive or other authority pursuant to

which the program was undertaken, highlights of the results achieved and

significant problems encountered, to name but a few.

Pursuant to this request, Mr. Bundy was furnished by letter of

• July 25, 1961, a copy of the IIC status report dated July 25, 1961, wherein

he was advised in part as follows:

"I. IDENTIFICATION AND INVESTIGATION OF POTENTIALLY

DANGEROUS PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES*

The FBI maintains a current list of individuals, both

citizens and aliens, to be considered for apprehension

and detention, if necessary, in a period of emergency.

Approximately 12,000 individuals are listed at this time.

This list is kept current on a daily basis by the addition

of new individuals whose activities make them potentially

dangerous to the United States, and by the deletion of

individuals who are no longer engaged in subversive

activities. Included on the list of potentially dangerous

individuals are nearly 200 persons who are engaged in

pro-Castro Cuban activities or who sympathize strongly

with such activities. In addition to members of the

Communist Party, it also includes certain members of such

organizations as the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, the

Nation of Islam, and the Socialist Workers Party."

*Sce Appendix for additional information concerning-Emergency Detention Law

NW 54969 Docid:32989720 Page 116

---

## Page 117

As indicated in the last sentence, from information furnished to the

President, it is apparent that the problem area being discussed included not only

members of the Communist Party and their apparent capability of action in the

field of sabotage and espionage during an outbreak of war but also such organi-

zations as the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, Nation of Islam, and the

Socialist Workers Party, organizations whose potential for internal disruption

in time of emergency is the matter in question.

In further illustration of this point, on May 11, 1961, former

Director Hoover submitted a memorandum to top Bureau officials, wherein

he described a presentation to the President concerning the FBI's intensifi-

cation of its coverage of Cubans in this country, both anti-Castro groups

and pro-Castro groups. During an NSC meeting on April 27, 1961, it is

apparent that the thought in the minds of the men discussing this matter

extended not only to the possibility of espionage and sabotage activities of the

pro-Castro groups discussed but the possibility that the anti-Castro groups

discussed might well be involved in activities which would involve terrorism

or violence of a domestic nature.

• As previously noted, in 1962, the supervision of the IIC and the

overall responsibility for the internal security programs of the United States

passed by National Security Actioh Memorandum 161 to the Attorney General.

From that date to the present time, the FBI has reccived on a case-by-case.

basis specific instructions from the Attorney General regarding investigative

- 27-.

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 117

---

## Page 118

matters pertinent to the delegation of intelligence investigation authority in

numerous areas involving individuals or organizations which advocate violence

or the denial of rights of others.

Let us pause to summarize the position of the FBI at this time in

history.

The Directives cast the FBI in an intelligence-gathering posture

which was recognized by the Governmeat as a body and the American public.

As herein indicated by the previous examples, the FBI gradually came to be

assigned intelligence investigations outside the foreign controlled espionage

and sabotage matters and into an area of intelligence investigations regarding

"other intelligence matters affecting the internal security," to wit; Puerto Rican

nationalists, anti-Castro groups, Nation of Islam, Socialist Workers Party,

"hate groups," and others advocating the violent overthrow of the Government

or who could, on reasonable belief, cause disruption of the "national welfare"

and in time of emergency, be of assistance to foreign powers. These matters

were automically referred to the FBI because we had been cast in the "intelligence

posture" as a direct result.of the Presidential Directives coupled with the fact

that the FBI has statutory investigative jurisdiction of the criminal violations in

the general area of internal security. Our position had become twofold:

(1) intelligence gathering in the arca of internal security and (2) investigation

of criminal statutory violations, both in the internal security area.

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 118

- 28 -

---

## Page 119

• During the turbulent 1960's, Executive concern for the internal

security and national welfare naturally increased due to campus riots, racial

unrest, militant groups who ambushed police and bombed, the increase of

activity of "hate groups," both "far right and left," and the open advocacy

of entirely domestic groups to overthrow the Constitution and Government of

this Nation. Because of the intelligence criminal investigative posture of the

FBI in the internal security field, the inquiries and orders were naturally

directed to the FBI. We responded because we had come to recognize and operate

within our dual posture of intelligence and criminal investigation.

Can we illustrate how this dual posture was magnified and

expanded since the 1950's and early 1960's? • .

Clear evidence exists that past Presidents and Attorneys General

have assumed the FBI's intelligence-gathering authority.

For example, by memorandum dated April 28, 1965, to Bureau

officials, former FBI Director Hoover recounted a conversation with the laté

President Lyndon B. Johnson, which occurred on that date, during which

Johnson expressed profound concern that his military and foreign policy

with respect to Vietnam was being undermined by anti-war agitation in

the United States, particularly on the college campuses. The memorandum

of former Director Hoover noted that, during their conversation, he informed

the President of FBI information concerning forthcoming demonstrations and

instructed that a memorandum be prepared for President Johnson concerning

the Students For a Democratic Society.

in:

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 119

---

## Page 120

Further, by letter of September 14, 1967, the Attorney General,

Ramsey Clark, obviously concerned with recent riots of that period, directed

& letter to the FBI, wherein he instructed that the FBI conduct investigation to

determine whether there was an organization which made advance plans for

and was active during any of the riots in the Summer of 1967. He pointed out

that, in view of the seriousness of the riot activity across the country, it is

most important that the FBI use the maximum available resources, investigative

and intelligence, to collect and report all facts bearing upon the question

as to whether there was scheme or conspiracy. He enumerated various criminal

statutes, which he pointed out should be considered if prosecution was a

possibility based on the investigation but clearly recognized the intelligence-

gathering role of the FBI.

:

To further illustrate, reference is made to the Attorney General's

letter to Director, FBI, dated February 18, 1969, wherein he requests broad-

scoped and comprehensive investigation of the Students For a Democratic Society

in relation to the illegal and violent campus disorders of that period. (For

Details, See Appendix.)

It must be recalled that, pursuant to the National Security Action

:

Memorandum 161, the President had assigned to the Attorney General the

responsibility of the internal security in 1962. As illustrated, no more broad

instruction for intelligence investigation could have been phrased. Thesc Ictters

clearly rccognizc the dual function of the FBI in its intelligence-gathering

role and in its criminal investigative role.

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 120

---

## Page 121

Further evidence of the recognition of the dual role of the Ecderal

Bureau of Investigation is illustrated by reference to the Intelligence Evaluation

Committee (IEC). Based on the President's need to know, Presidential

• representatives, Attorney General representatives, and others, on or about

December 17, 1970, formed this Committee with the purpose of obtaining reports

and information concerning militant terrorist groups operating within the

United States. This was for a dual necessity, its efféct on the internal national

welfare and how such activity might affect the foreign policy and war effort.

This Committee, composed of members of the Executive, pursuant to their

authority under the Interdepartmental Action Plan for Civil Disturbances,

a plan for the Executive to meet emergencies, requested through the Attorney

General that reports and intelligence information be furnished to the Committee

for the benefit of the Executive. This is another graphic illustration of how the

Executive has relied on the intelligence function of the FBI.

In summary, the FBI has had authorization and approval of the

President and Attorney General to investigate matters concerning internal security

since the verbal instructions of August, 1936; the Presidential Directive of

June 26, 1939, as augmented by the Presidential Directive of September 6, 1939,

down to and including the charters by the NSC and the Attorney General. The

• FBI has conducted these intelligence investigations under the scrutiny of the

Executive Branch as hercin indicated.

= 31 -

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 121

---

## Page 122

VII. Has Congress Recognized the Dual Intelligence--Criminal Role of the FBI Which

Results From the Directives?

Absolutely. On November

• 30, 1939, some 85 days after the public

Directive of September 6, 1939, former Director Hoover appeared before Congress

as reflected in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill of 1940

testimony wherein he states that in September, 1939, the General Intelligence

Division was organized based on the Presidential proclamation that all complaints

regarding violation of the National defense statutes be referred to the FBI. He

described in his testimony that the function of the Intelligence Division was to

"compile extensive indices of individuals, groups, and organizations engaged

in these subversive activities, in espionage activities, or any activities that are

possibly detrimental to the internal security'of the United States." (Emphasis Added)

Again, in testimony under Justice Department Appropriation Bill

of 1941, former Director Hoover specifically cites verbatim the Presidential

Directive of September 6, 1939, the public Directive not the confidential

Directive of June 26, 1939, and thereafter in narrative describes the general

intelligence activities of the Bureau, the coordination system between the FBI

and military intelligence services, plant protection, and the opening of ten

added offices to handle the volume of work in the intelligence field. Further

testimony was furnished on June 6, 1940, with reference to the Supplemental

National Defense Appropriations Bill of 1941 and such testimony has continued

in subsequent years to the present, each time setting forth the specific areas of

intelligence investigations. This testimony includes, for example in the 1973

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 122

---

## Page 123

appropriations testimony, information regarding investigations of New Left

terrorism, antiwar

• demonstrations, student agitation, Communist Party, USA,

Socialist Workers Party, Progressive Labor Party, racial extremism, Black

Panther Party, Student National Coordinating Committee, Junta of Militant

Organizations, extremism in penal institutions, Klan-type organizations, urban

guerrilla warfare, bombing matters, espionage and counterintelligence to

mention only the work done by the Bureau in the intelligence field.

In addition, voluminous intelligence information has been furnished

to investigative committees of the Congress regarding internal security matters

and at no time did Congress, having been advised as above, offer objection by

means of legislation or enactment to the intelligence field of investigation.

VIII. Do the Directives in Any Way Alter the FBI's Jurisdiction as Assigned By Statute

or Other Executive Order?

Nothing herein alters the FBI's basic responsibility assigned by

the Attorney General under Title 18, Section 533, U. S. Code, to investigate

statutory violations which are the mandate of Congress and specific Executive

Orders of the President relative to employee loyalty matters.

IX. What Effect Would Be Realized If the FBI Had Not Had the Directives 'ór

If the Directives Were Revoked?

The effect of the Presidential Directives of August, 1936, and June 26,

and September 6, 1939, is to place the FBI in an affirmative intelligence-gathering

posture. The FBI overtly secks intelligence information in the internal security

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 123

- 33 -

---

## Page 124

field based on the Directives.

Should they be nonexistent or revoked, the FBI

would be placed in a position of merely investigating violations of statutes. Investi-

gation would commence only at a point where some set of facts would indicate a

"strong suspicion," "reasonable grounds to believe," or "probable cause" that

a violation of law was about to be or had been committed and a person or group of

people committed it, i.e., no overt, offensive search for intelligence information

in the internal security field regardless of lack of specific statutory violation.

In summary, the question should be not one of whether the FBI has

authority to conduct intelligence investigations, this has been herein reflected,

but whether the FBI has acted reasonably under that authority.

Compare, if you will, the FBI Agent who, having lawful probable cause

to search for three large stolen television sets, obtains a search warrant, valid

: on its face, for a residence and thereby enters and conducts a search pursuant

to the warrant. He is lawfully and with authority in the residence but while

there searches a small drawer in a desk, where no television set could possibly

be secreted. Narcotics are found. Are they admissible? No. The search is

"unreasonable" under Fourth Amendment standards as it pertains to the narcotics,

however, this in no way effects the Agent's lawful presence in the residence

under the authority of the warrant.

This is analogous of the situation in which the FBI finds itself today.

The FBI has the authority to be in the intclligence field under the Directives,

however, will be challenged as to the reasonableness of its activities and conduct

in the field.. (Emphasis Added)

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 124

---

## Page 125

The FBI has over the years limited the boundaries of this authority

on its own with minimal guidance from the Executive and the Attorney General. In

most instances this self-limiting has been more to restriction than liberalism. If

outside challenge is made to the FBI's conduct to date, it should be properly

addressed to the limits and boundaries of our activities, not the authority itself.

CONFIDENTIAL MELORANDUM

POOSEYELT

This norning, in accordance with the request of the President

conveyed to me personally by hin last Weanesday in New York City, I called

at the Thite House at 9:15 and was with the President vatil 10:15.

He was desirous of discussing the question of the subversive

activities in the United States, particularly Pascism and Communisia. He

had previously received the nemoranaun which I had prepared covering ay

• conversation viüh General Smedley Butler and the effort of PathariCougalin

to have Goncral Butler head an expedition to Mexico. I incormoù the President

concerning certain recent developments in ina Communist activities in ine

counts], particularly the effosts of the Bridges organization in San Fran-

cisco and their progressive control of the shioping on the Pacific Consù,

the Gulf Coast and weir recent expansion to shiyping operations on te

Atlantic Coast. i told nin that wile their contract vill expire or

September 30, 1936, they are endeavoring io have it temporarily extended

until April 1, 1937, in ordes to conform to the same date that te Uniuçù

Mine Horkers' contract expires, vaich organization is headed by John I.

Lewis. I told hin that the Briages organization as practically controlled

by Connunists and that the Communists had zon deciued io make very deririte

plans to get control of the Lemis organization.

I called his attention to the activities of the lewspaper Guild

headed by Heywood Brown, which has strong Coumunistic leanings, and which

has been responsible for putting out of operation the Seatule Posi Intoi-

ligencer. I told him that my information vas that the Communists hau plarca

to geù control of thesa thrao groups and by doing so they vouid be able at

any tine to paralyze the country. in that they could stoo all shipping in

and out through the Bridges organization; siop the operation of industry

through the Mining Union of Lewis; and stop publication of any newspapers

of the country through the Newspaper Guila.

I also rolated to him the activities which have recently oc-

curred within Govcranental service inspired by Communists, particularly

in some of the Departments and in the National Labor Relations Board.

I likewise infornod him that I had received information to the

effect that the Cornunist Internationale in Mascow has recently issued in-

structions for all Communisis in the United States to vota for Presidcri

Roosevelt for reelection and against Goveror Landon because of to fact

that Governor Landon is opposed to class warfare:

The Presidont siated that he had been considerably concerned

about the movements of the Coummists and of Fascism in tie Vizited Statos

and that thile the Secret Servico of the Ireasury Department had assured

him that they had incornants in every Comunisi group, he believed that

If thai was true it was solely for the surpose i feiting any irforuation

upon plois upon his life, hercas wat he ras intarested in was obtrining

a broad pictura of tre genaral movemezt and its activities as may affect ine

economic and political life of the country as a raole. I tola hia thot there

is at ine present time no governmental organization nich is getting any

so-called "general intelligence information" upon this subject. He inquired

what suggestions I night offer relative to this matter.

I cold him thei

the appropriation of the Fedoral Bureau of Investigation contuins a provi-

sion thai it night investigate ay matters referred to it by the departient

of Staüe and that if the State Depariment shouia ask for us to conduct such

an investigation ne could do so under our present authority in the appro

priation already granied.

He stated that he is reluctant to have i forma?

request cose through the Siate Department because of the many leaks thorain, !

bụt that what he would do rould be to puù a handmitten memorandu on his

on in kis safe in the hite House, stating he had instructed the Sacretér..

of State to roost this inforzation to be obtained by the Department of

Justice.

He stated he mould have the Secretary of State at the lihite House

tomorro: afternoon, and asked me to call at the thie House at 1:45 p.n.

to see him, the President, and the Sacretam. of State, at thica time the

matter could be further discussed and an oral request could be made of e

by the Secretary of State for investigation so as to avoid any possivility

of any leak.

He suggested that I endeavor to coordinate any investigation

along similar lines wnich might be made by the Military or Naval Intelligenco

Services. He stated that the Secret Service was not being brought in on this

investigation as they should contine themselves strictly to the matier of

protecting his life and the survey nich he desired to have made was on a

much broader field.

menis were international in scope and that Communisn particularly was directed

*APPENDIX B

FERIODS OF PREDOLIWANT MILITARY

INTERESTS, NOI INVOLVING MARTIAL LAW

MI. In time of war certain areas will come intó prominence as potential

theaters of operation. Then an armed forces commander of such a potential

theater is designated, he definitely has interest in, though not control of,

i am army

the civilian life within the area.

In order that the armed forces counander

may prepare himself for the discharge of the possible responsibility mich

may affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon?

"I. Agents.of the FBI; of CNI; ID, Army; and the USI, IG, U.S. AIr

Force will continue to function in accordance with the provisions of Sections

II, I1l, IV, and Vo

12. In addition thereto, the armed forces commander may take steps

to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the manner in which con-

plete coverage will be obtained if artial law is declared. Adequate liaison

with the other subscribing agencies will insure that the armed forces commander

will have the benefit of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the repre-

sentatives of the other agencies.

M3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and receive

such information from the other thres agencies as he may desire and they may

be able to furnish.

"II. The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the coverage

furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any additional coverage each

• subscribing agency can undertake. Then the commander feels thai more complete

coverage is required, Iù is recognized that he is authorized to augment the

of the subscribing agencies as are under his

gorara lot such ee ta inrasion of the sheres normally coning under

the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies, the armed forces commander

should obtain the necessary authority from the Secretary of Defense.

"III. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations have

placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces conmander, wherever

any of the other services feel that such a survey to determine adequacy of

coverage should be undertaken, it should be so reconmended."

(1) Instructions

The major differences between the foregoing Delimitations Agreement •

and previous versions are as foilors:

The Director, OSI; USAF, is a party thereto.

The Bureau has jurisdiction over all civilians insofar as espionage,

counterespionage, subversion and sabotage are concerned, regardless of em-

ployment.

HISTORY OF THE MATIONALIST PARTY

The Nationolist Party of Puerto Rico clains that its

•origin can be traced back to september 23, 1868, when a small

revolution took place at Lores, fuerto Rico, for the purpose

of overthroiving the spanish Government, preparatory to establish

ing a Republic of puerto Rico. This revolution was quickly

quelled by spanish autrorities.

shortly thereafter, when Spain vas defeated in a

war with the United states, Puerto Rico was ceded to this country

in accordance with the ciains of the treaty of Paris.

The

Nationalist Party refused to recognize this Irecty, charging it

null and yoid where puerto rico is concerned.

Although there has long been an indeperdence

novement

in Puerto Rico, the lotionalist Party as it is known today did

•not come into existence until 1922.

In this year it was jormally

established at lio Piedros,

Puerio rico. The declared

purposes

of this party were and still are: (1) to secure the separation

of puerto Rico iron the United states; and (2) to create "a free,

OBSERTATIONS AND CONCLUSIOHS

In view of the constant threat from world connurism,

DIS

as the lationalist Party of Fuerto Rico, cots of violence ajject-

In the case of fuerto Rico, no positive neutrclizing

broader question naturally arises from this series of incidents

as to whatner it is recessary to cwalt eatensue damage cy

In conclusion,

it may be said that the effectiveness of.

I. O3JECTI VES

The over-all objective of the Internal Security irogram is to

protect the inited states against the throats of Communism and other

subversive movements, particulurly arainst the designs of Sovict

Russia and her satellites upon the security of the United States.

Sabotage, espionage and subversion within the United. States can cause

not only the loss of imerican lives and the loss of battles anyuhere

in the world, but can cause serious disruption of our productive

capacity and adversely arfect the maintenance of a stable economy•

Communist doctrine provides that a period of peace is to be

used to consolidate and strengthen the Communist forces in the world

while at the same time weakening and dividing the democratic nations

including disruption of the internal life of those nations economically,

politically and socially.

Thus the present Soviet "reace tactics"

• emphasize that our internal security protective coverage must be

maintained at a high level.

Soviet Fussia can continue to increase

subversive, disruptive tactics without risk or cost to herself commen-

surate "ith the potential beneficial results to the Soviet cause.

The Internal Security Program was formulated on the assumption

of a continuance of peacetime "cold war" conditions, Horever, it

includes the ejements to be expanded for a vartime operation. •

The major specific goals of the Internal Security Program are:

lo Io coordinate the activities of all agencies and departments

concerned with internal security ratiers, including investigations, the

collection of domestic intelligerce, and the integration of foreign

intelligence pertinent to the domestic intelligence field.

2. To continue the acceleration of investigations designed to

provide the basis for the apprehersion, prosecution, or other action,

against persons involved in subversive activities.

Зo To detect and mintain security indices on persons considered

dangerous to the national defense and public safety.

La To neutralise Communist front and Cormunist-dominated organi-

zations in the United States.

the use of microdots in espionage. Since it is extremely difficult to detect

these tiny photographic messages once they have been placed in correspondence

We have still a sixth program under which we continuously evaluate the

espionage and sabotage potential of individuals whose current activities indicate

that they might costitute a threat to the country in the event of a national

emergency. These include members of the Communist Party of the United States

and other individuals dedicated to the violent overthrow of our Covernment. We

Communist Party leaders are hopeful that, by exploiting such current

national and international issues as racial discrimination and peace, they can

bring about a resurgence of Party activity and influence. • For example,

Benjamin Davis, chairman of the Party's New York District, in a report made

in September of this year to top communist functionaries, stressed that the Party

should concentrate on the integration issue as symbolized by the Little Rock school

situation.

Diligent efforts are made by the communists to infiltrate Negro groups,

particularly at the local level, so as to agitate and create confusion.

The public usually associates the FEl's internal securit

investigations with Communist Party activities orly. Nothing could be

further from the truth.

Our investigations encompass any and all

organizations based on a creed of force and violence to determine whether

they are a threat to our internal security or whether they have violated

any Federal laws.

We investigate the activities of such diverse and international

organizations as the Marxist Socialist Werkers Party, and the Nationalist

Party of Fuerto Rico. (Responsible for attack upon Fresident Truman, 1950,

Confederate Underground." The latter is a name which has been mentioned on

a number of occasions in recent bombing threats and other forms of violence.

Since January 1. 1957, there have been over 90 bombings,

or attempted bombings, in the United States. Of these, at least 69 have

involved Negro victims and at least eight, Jewish religious and educational

In the early bombings there was no evidence to shory that these bombings

could be attributable to specific organizations. Rather, they were individual

acts of terror strictly within the jurisdiction of local authorities. When these

outrages occurred, we in the FBI have made immediately available to local

authorities our laboratory and fingerprint facilities here in Washington.

Recently, however, there has been some indication of a gencral

interstate pattern to these bombings. For example, one of the men indicted

(39)

on October 17, 1958, (Richard Bowling) for the bombing of the Jewish temple

in Atlanta, received from one of his fellow conspirators two checks vorte

nearly $200.

One of these checks was dated October 4, 1958, the day before

the Clinton. Tennessee, High School bombing; the other, October 9, 1958,

three days before the Atlanta temple bombing:

Recognizing the danger to the national welfare from a general

pattern of organized terrorism, the FBI has moved to expand its assistance

to local law enforcement in the recent bombings at Clinton, Atlantz, and

(11)

Peoria, Ilincis. We are now providing all-out investigative assistance in

these cases. We are closely checking the activities of individuals prominently

of special conferences for November and December, 1958. to discuss our

cooperative services regarding bombings and threats of bombings against

religious and educational institutions

Our entry into these cases at this new level is not to be interorcted

as an attempt on our part to usurp the jurisdiction of local authorities. To give th

FBI this jurisdiction would relieve local governments of the basic responsibility

to maintain law and order, and the ultimate responsibility rightfully rests at the

Act of 1950" (64 stat. 987-1031) as amended, provided for the emergency

detention of "each person as to whom there is reasonable ground to believe

that such person probably will engage in, or probably will conspire with

other's to engage in, acts of espionage or of sabotage." From the time Sub-

chapter II of the Internal Security Act of 1950 was enacted until the repeal

of this law by the Congress, the FBI operated under a Congressional mandate

which required the identification of all persons who might be covered by its

provisions in the event of a national emergency.

• •

What is the effect of the repeal of Subchapter Il of the Internal

. Security Act of 1950 upon the jurisdictional basis for investigations conducted

by the Intelligence Division?

Essentially none. During the time Subchapter II was in effect,

lists of individuals to be considered for apprehension and detention under the

provisions of Subchapter II during a period of emergency were compiled based

upon information derived from investigations of subversive organizations and

individuals. However, investigations were not instituted for the sole purpose

of determining whether an individual should be considered for emergency

apprchension and detention under the provisions of Subchapter II. The

identities of individuals who might be appropriate for apprehension and detention

in a national emergency were a by-product of the FBI's investigations in the

subversive field based upon statutes, Exccutive Orders pertaining to national

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 220

security and instructions from the Director of Central Intelligence pursuant

to power vested in that office by the National Security Act of 1947. In summary,

passage of the dotention provisions incorporated in Subchapter II of the

Internal Security Act of 1950 did not enlarge or restrict the FBI's jurisdiction

to collect information pertaining to national security. Our national security

jurisdiction has been delineated by Congressional statutes and Presidential

Directives independent of the detention provisions of Subchapter Il of the Internal

Security Act of 1950. This provision of the law affected how information collected

pertaining to national security was to be administered, retained, and retrieved

should exigent circumstances arise. Consequently, although repeal of the detention

provision of the Internal Security'Act of 1950 eliminated the Congressional mandate

requiring maintenance of lists of persons to be considered for apprehension and

detention during the period of emergency, it did not limit or enlarge the jurisdiction

and authority of the FBI to collect information in the national security field.

In this connection, it is worthy to note that on November 30, 1939;

shortly after issuance of the Presidential Directive of September 6, 1939,

Director Hoover offered the following testimony before the House Appropriations

Committee in connection with the FBI Emergency Supplemental Appropriations

Bill of 1940:

"Purpose and Work of General Intelligence Division

In September of 1939 we found it necessary to organize a

General Intelligence Division in Washingion. The establish-

ment of this division was made necessary by the President's

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 221

## Page 222

proclamation directing that all complaints of violations of

the national defense statutes and proclamations be

reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This

division now has compiled extensive indices of

individuals, groups, and organizations engaged in

these subversive activities, in espionage activities, or

any activities that are possibly detrimental to the

internal security of the United States.

The indexes have been arranged not only

alphabetically but also geographically, so that at

any time, should we enter into the conflict abroad,

we would be able to go into any of these communities

and identify individuals or groups who might be a

source of grave danger to the security of this country.

Their backgrounds and activities are known to the

Bureau. These indexes will be extremely important

and valuable in grave emergency."

Thus, it may be seen that the compiling of lists of potentially

dangerous persons and individuals had been undertaken by the FBI prior to

enactment of the detention provisions of the Internal Security Act of. 1950 as part of

the Burcau's implementation of the Presidential Directive of September 6, 1939.

MENORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON

MR. PARSONS

MR. BELMONT

1

On Apnil 27, 1091, I attended, at the request of the Attorney Ceneral,

a meeting of tab rational security Council presided over oy the president.

The first part of the meeting consisted of a discussion of the situation in

laos, which in no way involved the t3I.

The second part of the meeting doalt with the Caban situation. There is

was a general discussion by variois menbers of the National security Council a3

to the many pases thai enter into this over-all problem.

The President inquired of me what my views were concerning the then

present sitaction. I told the president that there were approsiantely do, 000 Cubank

nationals in the iarai, Fiorida, general area and this troup posed a socirity

probies because of the fact that many of these individanis are bitter and disillusiono

as a rosalt oi the infusion doieat. I stated that large numbers of rafugees wino

particizated in the invasion forces are coming into florida by plane and by boat

¡rora the training camos anintained in Cantral erican countries. I stator that

a substantial amber will ting it curicalt to become readjustod to civilian lie.

• I stated it must ba remembered that this large group was looting for

and expecting United States leadership and sympathy in their continuinz efforts

againgt Castro. I pointed out thai the sons of Cardona and varora cou were me abers

of the invacion forces and were castired by Castro and I statod that there were no

doubt many other Cuban inmilies in the iriami area who had close members oi thoir

families who particizated in the invasion and have either bean stiled or captured,

and this all pointed no to the necossity for the Unitod states maintaining the care

for those retayees and piving the some guidance. I strassed the importance of

on

cons

IT United States having close lizison with this Cuban group and its several factions

on so as to give guidance to it.

Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, Parsons, Belmont

May 11, 1961

I outlined to the President the fact that the 2ei had intensified its

coverage of Casaas in this country, both anti-Castro arcaos and pro-Castro

groups. I conmertod brially anon the activities of the fair Play for Cuba

Committes and the clamonia in back of it.

I pointed out that the situation within Cuba would be, li course, even

more acute now than in the past and that Castro no dowdt had ibsen materiaily

strengthened militarily as a rosalt di the fallure of the inregion. I ctated that

Castro's government woud continue to receive military gauincent from the iron

Curtain nationg in view oi the fact thet the port oi barona was onen.. I said.

therefore, evon touca tao econorsic situation in Cuba tay bacozie inore critical,

certainly iron the point oi view ci military control and the runnine of a polica

MEMORAIDUM FOR THE DEECTOR,

FEDERAT

BUREAU OF INVESTICACION

Although the bulk of criminal offenses occurcing

In the course of recent riots have been, local rathes

than federal in nature,

the question as to whether

there was an organization which (a) had made advanced

plans for, and (b) was active during any of the riots

in the summer of

1957 is one that cannot always be

readily resolved by local authorities.

In rien of the

seriousness of the riot activity across the country

It is most important that you use the

marimum available

resources, investigative end intelligence,

to collect

and report all facüs bearing uron the question

25 to

whether there has been or is a scheme or conspiracy by

any Ercuo oi inatever size, effectireness or affiliation,

plan, promote os aggravate riot activity.

In this connection the following federal statutes

-could be applicaole depending: of course, upon the lectual

situation that develoys:

Title 18, USC, Section 2383; whick proserites

the inciting or engaging in any reballion or

insurrection against the authority of the

Unitad States.

Title 18, USC, Section 2304, which proscribes

conspiring to

overthron or

to dasticy by lorce

the Government of the united States or to

oppose by force the authoriiy thereor or oy

force to prevent, hinder or delay the execution

•of any law of the United Suases.

Title 18, USC, Section 2385, which proscribes,

Inter alia, advocacy of o'erthrowing the

ment of any state, territory, District or

political subdivision therein by force or

violence.

Crimes on Federal Reservations, 18 USC 13, 81 et al.

I appreciate that the Bureau has constantly been

alert to this problem and is currently submitting intelli-

gence reports to us about riots and about the activity of

certain groups and individuals before, during and after

a riot.

Indeea, the President has said both publicly and

privately that the FBI is conducting extensive and comprehen

sive investigations. of these matters.

•There persists, however, a widespread beller that

there is more organized activity in the riots then ie

presently know about. We must recognize, I believe, that

this is a relatively new area of investigation and inteili-

gence reporting for the FBI and the Department of Justice.

We have not heretofore had to deal with the possibility

of an organized pattern of violence, constituting a

violation of federal lan, by à group of persons who make

the urban ghetto their base: of operation and whose

activities may not have been regularly monitored by

existing intelligence sources.

In these circumstances, we must be certain that

every attempt is being mede to get all information

bearing upon these problems; to take every step possiols

NW 54969 Docld:32989720. Page 245

to determine whether the rioting is pre-planned or

organized: and, if so, to deterrine the identity of

the people and interests involved; and to deter this

activity by promot and vigorous legal action.

As a part of the broad investigation which must

necessarily be conducted, it is requested that all

available information be reported and analyzed regard-

in -Ing each sniger caught in any riot or extremist

activity and regarding those arrested during the course

of a riot or significant racial disturbances who were

not, residents of the general area. i moreover, sources

or informants in black nationalisi organizations, SNCC

and other less publicized grougs shoula de developed

and expanded to determine the size and purgose of these

groups and their relationshig to other groups, and also

to determine he hereabones of cersons tomight be

sarines,

allegations of conspiratorial activity that come to our

attention from outside sources such as those reported

regarding Newark in Life Magazine for July 23, 1967,

and those regarding the Detroit riot wich were furnished

to the Depariment by Walter Sheridan of the National

Broadcesting Company (surmary of latter is attached).

You will notice thint this phrasenlogy contains three limititions.

First, for personal services at the seat of governent an increase of

$100,000.15 allowed

Our present appropriation allows unmount of $1.872.480 available

for persoul services at the seat of government, and this proposed

supplemental appropriation wiil increase that amount to $1.972.480.

Phe proposed phscolory in this supplemental estimate allows in

amount of $75,000 for the purchase and exchange of motor-propelled

passenter-carning vehicles.

The original appropriation for the fiscal

year perints the purchase of such vehicles an the amount of 850.000.

If the supplement appmopriation for this items allowed. the lumta-

110n1 for 1h0

exchange of automobiles for the present

for 1940 of $20,000, making & totul amount of $120,000 arailable for

the confidential fund.

At the present time there are 47 agents and 1.014 clerks assigned to

duties at the sent of government.

The supplemental estimuto provides

for an additional $100.000 which would aller us to increase the stuff

at the seat of government by o agents and s3 elerks, making a total

personnel at the sent ni government of 49 agents and 1.097 clerks.

The additional personnel requested would be divided as follow's:

• NUMBER AND SOURCE OF COMPLAINTS OF ESPIONAGE, SABOTAGE, ETC.,

RECEIVED BY FEDERAL BUREAU OP INVESTIGATION

As a justification for this increase I would hke to point out that in

the fiscal year 1935 we received 200 complaints, involving mutters

pertaining to the national defense which includes violations of the

espionage, sabotare, and colnted mtional defense statutes.

Mr. HooveR. From the entire country. At the present time wr

are receiving 214 compiaints necessitating investigntive attention

daily. If that average continues we will receive a total of nyproxi-

• mately 78,000 complaints for the year.

This comparison is indicutive

of the incrense in tho volume of this work. If conditions become more

acute abroad, such complaints will increase materiaily.

Mr. LaMBeRIsoN. They are going over the heads of the local police

officers?

Mr. Hooven. Thut is impossible to determine without first investi-

gating the complaints received.

I do know that the complaints

received by the F. B. I. refer to violations of the Federal statutes and.

not to violations i local statutes

Mr. LuDLow. What is vour experience as to the percentage of the

complaints that have nou any substance?

Mr. Hoover. A comparatively small percentage of them. For

instance we recently rereired complaints of sauntage arainst certain

large linors.

Severul sich compinints hare been given to us in

reference to those ships.

They came irom sources considered reliable.

Steps had to be tuken promptly to make certain that proper protection

is accored to thom.

Mr. LuDLow. You cannot take any chances?

Mrs HooveR. No; we cannot.

This is also true with reference to

the protection of our nailonal deienses.

There has been

an increase in such complaints from 250 in the

nscal Year 1938 to 1,65l in the hscal year 1939, and for the present

year, the total number will be about 78,000.

PURPOSE AND TORE OF GEVERAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

In September of 1939 we found it necessary to orennize a General

Intelligence Division in Washington.

The establishment of this

division was made necessary by the President's proclamation directing

that all complaints of violations of the national deiense statutes and

proclamations be reported to the lederal burenu o1 investgation

This division now has compiled eatensive indices

of indisidunis,

groups, and organizations enguged in these subversive. artivities, in

espionage activities,

or why activities thut are possibiy detrimental

to the internal security of the United States.

The indexes have been arranged not only alphabetically but also

geographically, so that at any time, should we enter into the contlict

abroad, we would be able to go into uny of these communities and

identify individuns or groups who micht be a sourer of crate ranter

to the

security of this country.

Their backgrounds ari activities

are knos'n to the Bureau.

These indexes will be extremely important

and valunble in crave emergener.

As a result of the present dilliculty abroad the mail at the seat of

Government has increased tremendously.

About 10.000 communi-

cations are being received each month from persons and organizallons

ofering their services or secking positions, as well as the many com-

plaints of violations of the national-defense statutes. This corre-

spondenee in the majority of instances must be answered.

It has been necessury to estailish a translation section within the

General Intelligence Division whose function it is to review various

foreign-langunge material received ani secured by the Burcau.

A code section also has been

established within the General

Intelligence Division for the purpose of decoring any messages which

PLANT PROTECTION PROGRAM OF F. B. I.

Another phase of the general intelligence work which will place an

additional burden on our force, is that of plant protection.

Under

arrangements between Government departments, the Military Intel-

ligence and aval Intelligence

have turned over to

Federal

Bureau of Investigation the handing of ail piant protection incusures,

in addition to the investigation of espionge and other activities.

Many factories in this country are minuiacturing products for the

Anne and the tave under finverment contract.

The War. und

Nary Departments lure compiled a priority list of 130 piants which

they have requested the t.

B. I. to consider immediately for the

purpose of determining whether the proper plunt protection freilities

are sriulable.

There are 12,000 additional plants that would come under the plant

protection progran in the event of war between this country und s

foreign country.

Mr. LidIon. Plunts in the first group are already producing, are

they not?

Mr. Hoover. Yes; they are already producing, both for the Army

and the Jasy. In muny instunces it has been found that adequnto

plant protection measures have not been taken heretofore in these

plants.

To cite one instance, in one of the great airplane fartories on the

west coast, a very impostant plant. plans for one of the Army bombers

wore stolen.

We were successful in locating the man who stole them

and in having the plans returned.

The procedire under

which those plans were given out each day

was indicative of the lack of a proper protection program in thut luc-

tom. In the mornmy the drattsmen would secure plans irom the lore-

No inquiry sas mide as to their assuance and no record was kept

of the plans given nus. There ere no chochs as to who had the plans

or where they were.

That is one step we have taken for plant pro-

tection.

We have takon steps to have that sort of thing corrected.

l'nder our plant-protection program we have included the securing

of proper fire-fighting equipment, as well as an efficient and adequate

gunrd service.

It is not the intention of the Government to police any of those

factories.

We have had our agents in the field divisions call in for conference,

tho heads of the corporations listed on the priority list, and we have

outlined to them the things they should do to insure protection for

the production of their particulr articles of products that they are

manufacturing under army nud dary contracts.

Mr. Cardos. Your service has been limited to casual conferences?

Mr. Hoorel. Yes; but nitimately it will be a matter of inspection.

Our function will be to surrer the plant to see that the necessary pro-

tertise stops hure beon taken, or to seo that the plant does install

necessary prorisions to protect the plant aguinst sabotage or destruc-

tion.

Mr. Ludlon. Do you get cooperation from the factories them-

selves?

Mr. Hooven. Jes; we have been getting excellent cooperation

from many of the factories in the country.

They welcome the sug-

gestions they have received from us.

We have compiled a manual of plant protection, the first manual

of its kind ever prepared in this couutry.

We sought the advice of

the Burenu of Standards and Army and Tary officials in the prep-

aration of this manual, so that we may in turn be thoroughly equipped

to follow this program through with a mininum delay and maxinan

service.

Mr. LInkeRsoN. I thought these plants all had efficiency people.

or had a honk-ny with a national burean whose representatives visited

them frequently and tole them how to do those things.

Mr. Hoover. Only to a cortain degree, in connection with the nnt-

ter of fire protection, but not arminst sabotage or restruction.

1 hare been vert much surprised at the absolute lack of protective

measures in many of our great industrial piants. Some of the great

plants in the country have utilized practically no measures against

sabotage or destruction di property.

Mr. #unLon. Do they not carry auy lusurance?

NIr. Mooren. Ther do not carry insurance against sabotage; they

do carry insurance niminst fire.

In that item there is also a provision for a confidential fund of

GENERAL LITEILIGENCE ACTIVITIZE

I would like to point out the volume of work it connection with

national-defense matters, or what we call general intelligence activities.

During the fiscal year 1938 the Bureau received a total of 250 mat-

ters in that 1 year.

In 1039 this had increased to 1,051 matters. For

the current year te will probably lure i total. at the rate at which

we are now going. of 78.000 complaints under this classification. We

are receiving complaints at the present time at the rate of elt new

matters a Clay, as compared with 200 mattery for the whole year 1948.

I frould also like to point out the congestion that has arisen sa the

result of this increase in work, showing the reason why I am asking

for an additional appropriation.

The Bureau has pending on its dockets 21.916 investigative matters.

of which 7,418 are unassigned. making a total of 3t percent of the

matters unassigned.

I would also like to explain. in detail, the condition of the national-

Of the total mumber of matters pending, toll are in

connection with national-defense matters. Of that number 1.8tT have

not been assigned, because of lack of manpower. Becanse of un-

aroilable manpower 41 percent of the national-slefense cases ure un-

There are 1,549 delinquent national.

Now, as to the amount of work performed by the agents. the urerage

agent in the Burean is carrying more than 19 cases, which is an exces

sive number of cases for a man to handle.

1s I told you ou Friday:

the field personnel are working from 3 to à hours a day overtime.

Of the entire personnel of the Bureat we have 3X9 agents who hare

already been trained in the handling of this special kind of work.

Inder the present

arrangement the federal Bureau of Investisation handles all civilian

investigations arising within the United States and ils territories.

dealing with the carions phases of the national-defense work. The

Military and Naral Intelligence Divisions are confining their setiv-

ities to the armed forces, and they have also called upon as at times to

GENERIL ISTFIIIGANCE DIVISION

In regard to the Intelligence Division which his been set up in the

Bureau, when this work was assigned to us we organized at the scat

• will have supervision of espionage, sabotage, and other subressive

activities, and violations of the neutrality regulations.

That division consists of an assistant director and eiglit super-

PLANT PROTECTION WORK

One of the phases of the work to which we have given particular

attention has been the plant-protertion work. We have now assumel

juriscuiction, at the request of the army and the dary of plant-pro-

tection activities at all plants manufacturing any arricles for the

Army or the Nary.

In a time of greater emergency there mill be approximately 12.000

such plants operating in this country. At the present time there are

540 such plants actively engaged in the manufacture of materials,

under contract. for either the Army or the tary.

We have compiled the fist manual of its kind, known as the Plant

Protection Manual. which contains suggestions as to methods to be

followed in the protection of there plants. not only from the point of

viet of fire protection. but also in regard to the safeguardina of

documents and materials in thesé mants so that definite prechutions

can be taken to aroid dets of salotage nu thefts of valuable documents

at plants that are making commodities for the Army and the Nary.

Nr. Rosact. Is that mamml given to the plants?

Mr. Hoorer. o it ina very confidential manual issued only to the

special agents of the Federal Burean of Investigation and Army and

Navy intellicence overs.

The procedure we follow in comection with this work of plant

protection is to call in for conference the sicials of the various plant.

haring these contracts. and outline to them the steps they should sitt

in connection with precautions that must he exercised.

Then we will send one of our agents-and we have now a total of

3o0 men enraged in mtional defene workamen the carious plants

to make an mspection ni ghosiel conditions existine there. aud have

him report to is mpon things that should or should not be done.

Then we submit to the diners of the plant recommendations for

corrections that should le mace.

We do not. furnish protection to the

plant, but our position is as adviser on technical matters in connee-

tion with plant protection.

Since last September we have been able to complete 29 such in-puy-

tions of plants. and l othere de now in progress. We me doing the

That movement, as you gentlemen know, has changed its name

many times, while its party line changes from day to day. Thera

Is, however, one fact that prevails and that is that the party line

is based upon the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism.

I would like to present to the committee at this time a chart showing

the ramifications of the growth of the party in this country with

its various changes of names over a period of years.

"Kenintom a Criminal that son atrim "S ton" and

Mr. Hoover. They use the term "Ilarsism-Leninisin" as their so

called doctrine and philosophy.

That doctrine, as their own docu-

ments set torth, advocates the violent overthrow of capitalistic gov-

ernments.

They state that in their documents and in their speeches.

That doctrine further advocates the establishment, i place or the

capitalistic governments, of the dictatorship of the proletariat by

the Communists. It further states that that cannot be obtained

except by force and violence.

One of the great instruments and reapons used today by all Com-

munists throughout the world is the resort to propaganda and the

resort to the boring and termite tactics.

That is an entirely new

technique that came into being during the last World War, as I have

indicated, in the fifth-column movement. That is the type of warfare

they are resorting to today to take over countries without a direct

attack. of arms, but rather by penetrating into governmental func-

tions, into schools and into churches, where they will have access to

public expression and opinion.

I will deal with some of those activities in detail as I go on.

COMMUNIST FRONT ORGANIZATIONS

Senator FerGusox. If I may interrupt. Mr. Hoover, we have in the

displaced persons bill the use of the word "Communist" or "Commu-

nist Party." Is there any may you could lay down a standard by

which you could teil whether a man coming from a European country

tras or was not a Communist within such a meaning?

Mr. Hooser. As regards that, senator, the only way you can deter-

mine whether an individual is or is not a Communist is through an

investigation of the background of the man and his associations and

contacts.

The Communist-front organizations are the parrots or

the "Charlie McCarthys" for the Communist Party. Those organi-

zations can be determined by just analyzing how they follow the

party line.

The particular man you refer to may not be a member of the Com-.

munist Party of Imerica and prohably would not be coming from

Europe. He may not even be a member of the Communist Party of

the country from which he is coming.

Since the trial in New York

of the 11 Communist leaders, membership cards are no longer issued.

membership lists have been destroyed. and speret stays of communi-

cating with each other have been established, so thrt the only way

in which you could really tind out a man's connections is through an

investigation of him.

Senator Fencesox. What would you say a Marxist was?

Marxist oTher may he see us eat stalled

is, as adhering to the philosophy of Marx but not going as far as

Lenin. I personally think that is a fallacious line of demarcation.

I think they are largists and out-and-out Communists in the sense

that you and I use the word.

Senator FErGusox. That is my judgment-a Marxist is a Commu-

nist.

Mr. Hoover. I believe that very definitely.

Senator AIcCarrIs. Is not that largely true of Leninism?

Mr. Hoover. Exactly. They are synonymous terms, NIr. Chairman.

They call the philosophy alarsism-Leninisin. That is one word, a

lo go further into this matter, many Americans have been lulled

into a sense of complacency by the claim that there are comparatively

few members of the Communist Party of the United States of Amer-

ica. Personally, I would have no fear if the Communists could be

brought out into the open, but so long as the party is a branch of a

world-wide underground movement, inspired from abroad, they can-

not be dismissed lightly:

According to our best intormation, there is a total of 51,171 members

of the Communist Party in the United States at the present time.

I have here and wouid like to submit to the committee a chart show-

ing the distribution of the membership in the Communist Party by

districts and by States.

SECTIONS OF UNITED STATES WHERE CONSIUNISI PARIX IS STRONGEST

Mir. Hoover. Most of the members of the Communist Party in the

United States are in the concentrated sections of population of the

country. For example, New York State has 25,000 members: Cali-

fornia, 6,977; 1llno15, 3.061; Pennsylvania, 2,816; Ohio, 2,83k; Alichi-

gan, 1,200; assachusetts, 1.022; Nevada, 20; lyoming, 10; Tennes-

see 27; Alabama, 141; Yew Hampshire 13; and so on.

Even though

there are only 51,17t members of the party, the fact remains that

the party leaders themselves boast that for every party member

there are 10 others who follow the party line and who are ready, will- V

ing, and able to do the party's work.

In other words, there is a poten-

tial fifth column of 50,000 people dedicated to this philosophy.

Senator SaLToNsTiLL. I saw a report the other day that disturbed

me very much, and it seemed to me something was wrong somewhere.

There are & number of people free under small bonds and sometimes

without any bond who are deportable cases, that is, deportable aliens

who cannot be deported because they are refused behind the iron

curtain. Are they being turned loose or are you people keeping an

eye on them?

DENIAL OF VISAS BY RUSSIA OF AMERICAN COMMUNISTS

Mr. HooveR. Senator, I am very glad you mentioned that becauso

that is merely one of our many problems. Those people are aliens

who have been arrested and some of them have been proven to be

deportable on the grounds that they adrocute the overthrow of the

Government of the United States by force and violence. The Russian

Government has refused to grant them visas, ind they therefore

IATIONS, 1951

cannot be sent back to Russia or to one of the satellite countries from

which they came.

Senator McCarriv. Do you think it is a part of the plan to deny

them visas?

. Mr. Hoover. I am not far from having my suspicions along that

line, Senator.

I think it would be a very practical part of this

technique to have them here.

Under the rulings of our courts, those people cannot be held in

custody indefinitely. They must either be deported or released on

bond. When they are released on bond, it is our function to know

generally what they are doing.. That merely adds to those people

whose activities we should follow in this country. • I think it is almost

a travesty upon our democratic processes that you can have people in

this country who have been found to advocate the violent overthrow of

our form of government, yet you cannot deport them nor hold them at

Ellis Island.

Senator SALtOySTaLL. Why can you not hold them?

Mr. Hoover. They are released by orders of the courts.

Senator SArToNSTALE. I understand that:

Mr. Hoover. We do not have any law by which we can hold them.

It would be necessary for Congress to pass a law along that line.

To continue. the Communist Party is not a bona fide political party.

It is a highly organized, militant, and disciplined conspiratorial group

following the whims and dictates of international communism.

was proven in the ew York case which recently concluded with the

conviction of 11 members oi the executive board of the Communist

Party. The Communist Party of the United States constitutes a

fifth column if there ever was one.

EFFECT OF THE COMMUNIST LEADERS' TRIAL

The trial of the 11 members of the erecutive board of the Commu-

nist Party in New York last year took the Bureau approximately 10

years to prepare. We prepared a 1,53r-page brief, with a total of

1,033 exhibits. That was presented to the grand jury and indict-

ments were returned.

I have here a chart outlining the members who were indicted with

& brief statement about the case which I would like to submit to the

committee.

The trial of the Communist leaders removes any doubt in the

minds of right thinking people as to where the loyalty of the Com-

munist Party rests. It was brought out at the trial that the party is

a group dedicated to the overthrow of our Government.

The Communist trial in New York has also resulted in making the

work of the Bureau more dillicult, and I will cite the reasons why.

Before pointing out some of the problems that we have had to face,

let me siy that it was necessary in the trial to use seven informants

of the Bureau. They appeared and testified against the detendants.

We had more arailable if they were necessary, but the evidence was

so overwhelming that it was not necessary to introduce them.

All of the informants who testified were bona fide members of the

party. They had been in the party for some years. Mir. Thilbrick,

who was one of the principal witnesses for the Covernment, had been

in massachusetts. nother intormant who testined in that trial, the

night before ind conterred with and had been in conference with

high ranking members of the Communist Party and the next morning

testified against them as a representative of the fBI.

DECENTRALIZATION AND UNDERGROUND ICTIVITY OF COMMUNISTS

Now, that case, as I say, has raised certain problems because with

that penetration of their apparatus, the Communist leaders have

become increasingly security conscious and hare developed certain

security measures to protect their organization.

The trend has been toward the perfection of a highly developed

underground apparatus and decentralization of Communist Party

operations. This decentralization has almost tripled the number of

Communist Party clubs, the purpose being to do away with their

congregating in such large groups. As a security measure, no Com-

munist Party membership cards were issued in 1919. The mainte-

nance of membership records has been discontinued.. Members speak

in a jargon of double talk, and use codés in correspondence. A cour-

ier system has been substituted to protect confidential party communi-

cations. Public meetings are maintained at an absolute minimum.

Party records have been destroyed or removed to clandestine hiding

places. Secret printing facilities and supplies have been secreted for

future underground operations. Transfers of party members from

one district to another are now controlled through the use of an elab-

orate identification system.

the party today is in the process of selecting individuals for secret

• leadershin of its underground apparatus. To counteract the FBI:

penetration of the Communist Party, its leaders have established a far-

reaching and vigorous lovaity program of its own, calling for the

establishment of investigating committees in each State and a thorough

investigation of each member of the party as to personal history, activi-

ties, associations, contacts, and length of membership. Lach member

, of the party is being gone over thoroughly by the various investigating

gram of their own in operation.

" Now, I state these things because these steps tending toward security

within the party have made more dificult the Bureau's maintenance

of confidential informant coverage of the activities of the party. I

do not mean to infer to the committee that we do not have good sources •

of information or that me do not have good representation in the

party in varging positions of trust.

But it is true that it is more

difficult to penetrate the party today. Those in the party exercise

" greater caution. Investigation of party leaders requires more ingenu-

ity. The accitional budget request will materially aid us in main-

taining the type of corerage necessary for the preservation of our

internal security.

Senator Fencesay. Where are they getting their money?

Mr. Hoover. Various benefits and fund-raising drives are held from

which money is obtained. Then they also receite contributions from

Mr. Hoover. I cannot give you an oihand estimate on that.

Senator FErGUSox. Do they raise money here in Washington?

Mr. Hoover. They raise it all over the country and right here in this

city of Washington.

COMMUNIST FRONT ORGANIZATIONS

I would like now to take up the activities of certain of these front

organizations. A new drive is being launched in the Communist

Party circles to revive what is known as the united front program

which characterized the party's greatest growth in the middle thirties.

One of the great dangers of communism is the ability of its espousers

to infiltrate and corrupt various spheres of American life.

The way to evaluate the real electiveness of the Communist Party

is by observing its influence and its ability to infltrate otherwise

thoroughly American phases of life.

Combating the front organizations is more difficult today than ever

before. To prove party amliation is dificult: but their deeds and acts

expose them for what they are. They cannot long survive in the spot-

light of truth.

At the present time scores of known or suspected Communist Party

front organizations are under' investigation by the FBI. Many are

organizations national in scope with chapters in various cities through-

out the United States.

The Communist Party has through its increased activities,

deavored to exploit youths, reterans, civil rights, foreign nationality,

the press, radio, television, the motion-picture industry, educational,

political, women, and labor groups.

That statement can be corrob

orated by overwhelming tacts which we have in our possession.

Senator Hilt. Are you going to give us any illustrations of that?

Mr. HoovEr. Yes, I am.

Now, in connection with the Communist front organizations. the

FBI is primarily concerned with Communist infiltration of such or-

ganizations and the manner in which Communists seek to subrert these

organizations to further the Communist cause.

Experience has demonstrated that many fronts are used as a cover

for espionage purposes and others as a propaganda media.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION. OF BASIO INDUSTRIES

The Communists have long ad-

vocated working through trade-unions as a incans of accomplishing

their ends. Forty-eight percent of the membership of the Communist

Party is in the basic industry of this country. In this manner, they

would be able to sabotage essential industry in vital defense areas

in the event of a national emergency.

Our investigations disclose that Communist activities are most pro-

nounced in such strategic industrial areas as New York, New Jersey,

Ohio, Pennsylvania, California. and Michigan.

Communist efforts toward infiltration have been intensified in basic

industries vital to our security such as steel, heavy machinery, min-

ing, communications, transportation, the electrical industry, and the

maritime industry.

COMMUNISI PROPAGANDA ACITVITIES

The Communists have developed one of the greatest propaganda

machines that I think modern civilization has ever known.

They

capitalize upon ill-founded charges designed to enlist honest, progres-

I sive liberals to support left-wing causes.

". Of the many projessions, penetration of the legal profession is the

most amazing. As officers of the courts, well trained and educated,

lawyers have made some of the inest contributions to American life.

It is regrettable, therefore, that any association of lawyers till per-

mit itself to be used and parrot the Communist Party line.

Earl Browder, then the acting head of the Communist Party, on

September 6, 1939, while testifying before a congressional committee,

defined what he meant by the term "transmission belt."

/ He said, "Transmission belts reter entirely to the Communist ap-

proach to the problems of reaching the masses. Transmission belts

mean having

Communists work among the masses in the various

organizations."

- He later was asked about & group of organizations as to whether

they were Communist transmission belts.

When asked about tha

National Lawyers Guild, he replied, "Yes; they are one of the or-

ganizations"

-During the trial of the 11 Communist leaders in New York, the

bar was shocked by the actions of the deiense attorneys. Some of

those lawyers were members of the ilational Lawyers Guild.

INTERNAL SECURITY OPERATIONS

Mr. Hoover. The EBI's work in the internal security field continues

to mount and there is every reason to expect these matters will place

an increasingly heavier burden upon our investigative stali. Constitut-

ing a major responsibility of the FBI, investigations of internal secu-

rity matters are conducted to derelop evidence for legal proceedings

• as well as to enable Government officials responsible for the safety and

welfare of the citizenry to take appropriate corrective or preventive

action.

NEW LEFT TERRORISII

The Ne Left terrorism is best personified by the Weatherman

group, a group which split with the Students for a Democratic So-

ciety in 1969 so that it could build itself into a small, tough, paramili-

taïy urganization to carry out guerrilla wartare in order to bring

about a revolution in this country. The Weatherman, acidicted to vio-

lence and hostile to our society, has from its underground perch

59

claimed credit for the bombings at colleges. business establishments

and Government installations including the March 1971 bombing of

the U.S: Capitol. Over 20 Weathermen are currently FBI fugitives

for violations of Federal statutes or local mob action laws.

The prescht-day Students for a Democratic Society is dominated by

the Worker Student Alliance which in turn is.controlled by the com-

munist Progressive babor Party. The Worker Student Alhance tac-

tion is critical of bombing and violence in the belief that such tactics

would impede rather than aid in the development of the revolution-

ary movement at this time.

The Venceremos Brigade, organized in 1969 by a coalition of New

Left groups, has proclaimed its purpose is to perform manual labor in

the citrus and sugar cane fields of Cuba as a contribution to Castro's

economy and revolution. Since December 1969, some 1,550 young

Americans, in defiance of the State Department travel ban, have

journeyed to Cuba as part of the Venceremos Brigade. Another con-

tingent. the fifth. is currently planned for March 1972.

While in Cuba, Brigade members were subjected to revolutionary

speeches and were provided with hard-core revolutionary literature.

Repeatedly they were told they are the vinguard of the revolution

in the United States.

Although some of these college - and high school-age Americans have

rejected the communist propaganda and rerolutionary philosophy di-

rected at them in Cuba, many of the returning Brigade members en-

thusiastically adopted the anti-United States stance promulgated in

Cuba and have aligned themselres with the violence-prone Weather-

man and other extremist groups.

New Left, terrorists present a profound challenge to lan enfurcé-

ment. To their threats. their violence and their total disregard for the

law, the FBI and all law enforcement officers must respond in a lawful

and professional manner. Meeting the challenge mill require continued

vigilance to protect the lives and property of the public and continued

dedication to the task of bringing these terrorists to justice.

ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATIONS

Three groups emerged during the Spring of 1971 as the main spon-

sors of the antiwar morement. One group, the National Peace Action

Coalition, is dominated by the communist Socialist Workers Party

along with its youth group, the Young Socialist Alliance. The Coall-

tion adrocates mass nonviolent protest demonstrations on the sole

issue of ending the war.

The second group, the Peoples Conlition for Peace and Justice, is

supported by various antivar groups but more importantly it has the

unqualified support of the Communist Party-USA. This group advo-

cates massive demonstrations, including cirl disobedience, to bring

about the end of the war. Into this issue; the Peoples Coaltion for

Peace and Justice injects poverty, racisin. repression and women's

rights, among others, on the premise that the war in Vietnam had an

intensifying eitect on these problems.

a group, tras or-

ganized in New York City in 1967 to stimulate veterans' opposition to

the Vietnam conflict. The group rallied several hundred members to

participate in theSpring 1971 antiwar demonstrations in Washington,

D.C. With a current claimed membership of over 10,000, this group

of Vietnam veterans has engaged in numerous local actions, including

picketing and simulated battle scenes, to protest not only U.S. involve-

ment in Vietnam but also conditions of racism and poverty in our

country:

STUDENT AGITATION

Disruptions on the Tation's college campuses during the 1970-1971

school year took a heavy toll in lost academic time, property damage,

personal injury and death. iearly 600 demonstrations occurred, in-

cluding 49 sit-ins and building seizures. The Reserve Oincers Training

Corps was the target of In attacks. There were over 30 instances of

arson and there were 13 Wombings. Over 150 personal injuries were

sustained, approximately 10t by police and school authorities. Four in-

dividuals were killed during the disturbances and property damage was

estimated at approximately $t. million.

The current school year. which began in the Fall of 1971, has seen a

general lessening of student activism. There have been only 58 dem-

onstrations reported on college campuses, including eight sit-ins. tso

bombings, and four arsons. Inzuries to police and participants dropped

to five. Approximately of arrests have been reported. Damages to col-

lege facilities amount to approximately $322,000. In genora, u chrito

lessening in the leel of student participation in demonstrations is

being reported (February 23.1972).

OMISIUNIST PARTY-USA

Completely under Soviet influence, the Communist Party-USA

consistently follows the lead of the Soviet Union. Party leaders con-

stantly criticize policies of the United States while praising policies of

the Soviet Union as the Party seeks to broaden conflicts within the

United States in areas ot racial, labor, welfare and antimar activities.

A major effort of the Communist Party-US A , has been directed

into the campaign to support Ingela Daris, an admitted communist

Party member, indicted for the crimes of murder. kidnaping and con-

spiracy in Marin County, Callt., arising out of the abortive escape at-

tempt in August 1970, by Negro convicts on trial in a county court-

room. On February 23, 1972, Davis was released on bail pending trial.

The Party has mobilized broad support from diverse clements in the

United States and abroad through its propaganda that Duvis is being

prosecuted because she is i black communist. Every possible ploy is

being utilized to divert attention from the criminal charges and to

imply Davis is being tried solely because of her political beliefs.

Ever mindful of the communist dictum that the revolution must be

led by the working class. the Party in 1970 instituted a new front

group, the National Coordinating Committee for Trade Union Action

and Democracy. Through this front the Party is attempting to regitin

lost influence in the labor movement.

The Communist Party-TSA has long sought to become an effec-

tive force in the peace movement and is presently making a strong

effort to dominate the Peoples Coalition for Prace and Justice. The

Party favors a quasi-reformist rhetoric and although it is willing to

work with the pacifist radicals and the rerolutionary comminists and

anarchists in the Peoples Coalition, the Party prefers an approach

thich would de emphasize the disruptive and civil disobedience tactics

demanded br the more activist elements writhin the Peoples Coalition.

This is in line with the Party's pose that it represents a reasonable

alternative to the disruptiveness of the radical left.

The Party is making a concerted effort to change its public image

and to gain acceptance as a legitimate political party. In the 1972

Presidential election the Communist Party-l.SA aims to place its

general secretary, Gus Hall, on the ballot for President and Jarvis

Tyner, a Party National (ommittee member, for Tic President. In an-

other move intended to increase its stature. the Party again plans to

issue membership books and dues stamps. practices discontinued as

security measures in 1918. The most ambitious attempt to gain public

favor was the November 1971 filming for television of a portion of a

traditionally secret National Committee meeting..

tutions of learning. A listing of appearances made during the 1970-

dents to adopt revolutionary behavior through campus chapters

throughout the United States.

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY

The communist Socialist Workers Party, a Trotskyist organization,

has been actively engaged in promoting und planning antivar demon-

strations through its front group, the National Peace Action Coalition.

Also participating in this antiwar group is the Young Socialist Alli-

• ance, the youth wing of the Socialist Workers Party. The loung

Socialist Alliance is extremelv well organized and continues to appeal

to young radicals in the United States

it has

virtually complete control over the broadly based Student

Mobilization Conmittee to End the War in Vietnam which professes

to be the largest national student antiwar group.

RACIAL EXTREMISAI

The coverage of the activities of black and white racial extremists

continues to place heavy demands upon the # bl.

THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Most prominent among the black extremist groups is the Black

Panther Party. 'The Black Panthers call for the overthrow of our

Government which the Party claims is engaged in a massive con-

spiracy to repress all minorities, kill all Black Panthers and practice

genocide against the black race.

(Discussion off the record.)

Early in 1971. à serious split dereloped between Huey P. Newton,

self-styled Supreme Commander of the Black Panther Party, and

Eldridge Cleaver, then the Minister of Information and a fugitive cur-

rently in exile in Algeria. Warring factions loyal to each resulted.

Within 2 months. one member of each faction was murdered with each

faction accusing the other and threatening reprisals. The Cleaver tac-

tion is calling for consrant violence and revolution now.

The larger Newton faction, in an effort to improve the Panthers'

image, is calling for "survival pending the revolution" which Newton

explains means working and surviving in the black community until

the revolution occurs.

The Newton forces hare 27 chapters operational throughout the

United States with some 450 hard-core members and the support of

thousands of sympathizers. The Cleaver followers number 250 plus

many sympathizers with the main strength centered in New York City

but with scattered points of support in other large cities.

The chief target of Black Panther violence and invectives has al-

ways been local law enforcement as epitomized by its perennial slogan

"Oft the Pigs." Panther jargon for "kill the cops." The Panthers main-

tain that the police are an extension of the "power structure" of "im-

perialistic" United States and since the police are readily available

every day, they have urged their followers to attach the police at every

opportunity. The efiectiveness of this campaion is eridenced by the

fact that since 1967 P'anthers have been allegedly responsible for the

killing of 12 police officers and the wounding of 71 others (February 23,

1972).

The Newton-led faction has toned down its public demands for vio-

lence and attacks upon police and has shifted its propaganda to em-

phasize community service in an chort to repay its image. brograms.

such as free breakfasts for children, health clinics. tree clothing for

the poor and free bus service for visitors to penal institutions are being

highlighted. Panther claims to extensive accomplishments in the serv-

ice to the community. however, are highly exaggerated. Much of the

food contributed by local merchants actually is used to feed the adult

members of the Black Panther Party. The health centers are staffed by

attendants untrained for medical work and of little serrice. First choice

o'i clothing is given to Black Panther Party members iith the remain-

der being handed out in the ghetto areas to the accompaniment of much

publicity.

In contrast to the efforts by the Newton group to project a non-

violent image, the Cleaver faction has adopted programs of unre-

strained violence against the existing order. Individuals associated

with the (leaver group have been linked to murders, arsons, attacks

on police officers, aircraft hijackings, and armed robberies. The official

newspaper of the Cleaver faction is known as "Right (n! " This publi-

cation has called for the assassinations of the President. the Attorney

General, the Director of the FBI and other Government oflicials. The

As his wife toured the [nited States, Eldridge Clearer was busy

creating tiro new revolutionary units. The Revolutionary Peoples

Communications Network was established as an international abôre-

ground'liaison organization to publicize and coordinate the activities

of all revolutionary groups. Its underground counterpart is the afro-

American Liberation Army which will foster urban guerrilla war-

fare in the United States. The organ of both new organizations is.

"Babylon," a biweekly publication which parallels "Right On!" in its

call for revolutionary violence and disruption. Cleaver has assumed

personal command of the Afro-American Liberation Army from Al-

geria where he is in exile.

So that he mar devote his full energies to guerrilla activities, Clearer

has relinquished control over the Black Panther Party international

section in Algiers, naming Felix "Pete" O'Neal as his replacement.

O'Neal, also a fugitive from justice, once headed the Black Lanther

Party chapter in Kansas City, No.

STUDENT NATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE

Another all-black rerolntionary

organization is the Student Na-

tional Coordinating Committec which at the time of its founding as a

civil rights group in 1960 iras known as the Student Nonviolent Co-

ordinating Committee. Leaders of the group have included well-

known black extremists Stokely Carmichael, who now lives in Guinea,

and H. Tap Brown. Wanted on local charges of inciting to riot and

arson, as well as on a number of Federal charges, Brown was appre-

hended in New Tork City in October 1971 following the armed rob-

William Hunt, currently titular leader of the Student National Co-

ordinating Committee, is spearheading eflorts to revitalize chapters

throughout the country. Included among these efforts are programs

aimed at establishing black, revolutionary labor, student and youth

groups.

OTHER BLACK EXTREMIST GROUPS

Other black extremist groups. most operating locally and region-

ally, spread revolutionary rhetoric and promote violence and con-

frontations with law enforcement officers.

One such organization is the Junta of Militant Organizations, also

known as JOMD, with headquarters in Florida. JOMO, dedicated to

the liberation of the black man, has declared it is necessary to bring

down the capitalistic system in the United States and replace it with

a socialistic system. Members of JOMO hare participated in fire

bombings, armed confrontations with police and actual attacks on

police with the use of firearms.

The Republic of New Africa is another militant black revolutionary

organization. Its principal factions are located in Michigan, Missis-

sippi, and Louisiana. In August 1971, at dachson, wliss...Its members

engaged in a shootout with law enforcement oficers who approached

the Republic of New Africa headquarters there seeking four fugitives,

one wanted for murder in Detroit, Nich. Durig the shootout, one

police officer was killed and a second officer and än FBI agent were

wounded. Eleven members of the group. including Richard Henry, one

of the founders, have been charged on a variety of counts including

conspiracy to commit murder and assaulting a Federal officer.

"BLACK ESTRENISTS IN PENAL INSTITETIONS

It is becoming increasingly evident that black extremist activities in

our penal system are increasing at an alarming rate. Rebellion such as

occurred at the prison at Attica, Y.X., has brought into sharp focus

major activities of black extremists, such as the Black Panther Party,

within the penal institutions.

The unrestricted flow of extremist propaganda, including its revo-

lutionary rhetoric, has stimulated the black, hardened criminal prison

inmates into an unholy alliance with the black revolutionary extrem-

ists. With the lessening of the Vietnam issue other extremist groups

such as the Students for a Democratic Society and Progressive Labor

Party are also interjecting themselves into the dangerous situation

that now exists in our penal institutions.

KLAN-TYPE ORGANIZATIONS

The FBI has continued to investigate Klan-type organizations which

had a slight increase in membership from 4,300 a year ago to approx-

imately 4,500 at present. This increase in membership is attributed to

some extent to renewed interest in Klan-type organizations brought

about. by reaction to school busing directives in order to achieve racial

balance in public schools. In addition to the membership, many thou-

sands of sympathizers lend their support to Klan programs and

activities.

A number of

ser small hate-type groups, exc

Ively white, con-

tinue in existence. These groups such as the National Socialist White

People's Party (formerly the American Naz Party), the National

States Rights Party and the Jational Renaissance Party, obtain public

attention in excess of their numerical strength by carefully orchestrated

demonstrations and colorful public appearances in order to gain con-

verts and, or sympathizers to their causes.

URBAN UNREST

"...

During the calendar year 1971. 109 incidents involving mob violence

tere reported as compared to 159 for all of 1970. Resulting from

the 1971 incidents were 2.033 arrests. 213 personal injuries, three

deaths and property damage amounting to about $1.7 million.

Disorders in the Nation's secondary schools continue to provide

strong evidence that racial discord is far from being at an end. A

total of 360 disturbances, during which there were.28 personal in-

juries and 2,455 arrests. were reported for the 1970-1971 school year.

During the 1971-1972 school year, 125 school disturbances involving

331 personal injuries and 750 arrests have been reported (February 21,

1972).

According to information received by the FBI through the Uniform

Crime Reporting program, 20 police oficers died in ambush-type at-

tacks, the mark of the extremist or terrorist. in 1971 and 19 oincers

died in ambush-tre attacks in 1970. But. during the previous perioc

from 1961 through 1969 only three ambush-type killings of policemen

were reported.

During 1971, extremists tere known to be or suspected of being

involved in 76 unprovoked and apparently racially connected attacks

on police, resulting in the deaths of 12 officers and the wounding of

47 others! Guerrilla-type ambushes accounted for eight of these deaths.

Although the overall number of extremist-type attacks on police de-

clined in 1971, the increase in ambush-type attacks on police during

the past 2 years is indicative of the growing terrorist threat to law

enforcement.

URBAN GUERRILLA WARFARE

Urban guerrilla warfare by black extremist organizations such as

the Black Panther Party, by white radical groups. such as the Weath-

erman, and by other organized terrorists is a serious threat to law

enforcement and the entire Jation.

Increasing evidence of bombings, burnings and unprovoked attacks

on police led the FBI to convene 51 selected State and local law enforce-

ment oficers from areas where this problem appears most serious to a

seminar on urban guerrilla warfare in Washington, D.C. in November

1971. The seminar explored this problem of secret and planned activity

designed to disrupt and terrorize the Government. Covered specifically

were the robbery or "espropriation" of funds. arms and esplosives to

further the revolutionary obiectives of these tanatical few.

The primary activity of the urban guerrilla is the unprovoked at-

tack on police ofticers which is designed to show that police are power-

less to protect themselves and, thus, to convince revolutionary sym-

pathizers that society can be overthrown. The urban guerrilla also

67

NW 54969 Docld:32989720 Page 295

## Page 296

hopes to provide over-reaction by authorities in order to radicalize

sympathizers who would not otherwise engage in violent activity.

Carlos larighella. deceased Brazilian revolutionary and author of

the "Mlinimanual of the Urban Guerrilla,

" instructed that, "Every

urban guerrilla can only maintain his existence if he is disposed to

kill the police."

The Weatherman group claimed credit for the bombing of New

Xork City police headquarters in June 1970 and Black L'anthers have

been identified in numerous attacks on police. The logic of the urban

guerrilla is simple, but terrifying: it police oncers cannot protect

themselves from ambushes, snipings and bombings, then the private

citizen is that much more defenseless against these weapons of the

revolutionary.

ANTIRIOT LAWS

The Federal antiriot laws, enacted in April 1968, established Fed-

eral jurisdiction for criminal prosecution in connection with certain

activities relating to civil disorders.

In May 1971, Abbott Howard Hofiman was indicted by a Federal

grand jury at Washington, D.C., on charges of violating Federal anti-

riot laws following an investigation by the FBI. The charges were

based on Hoffman's travel from Oklahoma to Washington, D.C., and

his activities during disruptions which occurred during antimar dem-

related matter. Hotiman was previously convicted for violating Hed-

eral antiriot statutes based on disruptions in Chicago in August 1968.

He was also cited for contempt based on his courtroom conduct during

his trial in that case. Both matters are presently under appeal.

Following extensive investigation by the FBI. a Federal grand

jury at Miami, Fla., in December 1970 indicted three leaders of an

organization known as the Black Afro Militant Movement. Two of

the leaders were charged with teaching and demonstrating the use of

explosive devices and possession of a destructive device in violation of

Federal antiriot and gun control statutes. The third leader was

charged with violation of l'ederal conspiracy and gun control statutes

based on possession of a destructive device. One defendant, after en-

tering a plea of guilty, was sentenced to 1 year's probation. Ihe other

tiro defendants were tried and convicted; one tras sentenced to 4 years'

imprisonment and the other was sentenced to serve 2½ years.

BOMBING MATTERS

The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970, enacted in October 1970,

• substantially broadened Federal jurisdiction in bombing matters. A

significant portion of the investigative responsibilities has been as-

signed to the FBI by the Department of Justice. While investigation is

conducted only in those instances specifically designated by the De-

partment, the cooperative facilities of the FBI are offered in all in-

stances to State or local law enforcement authorities conducting

investigation.

Investigations authorized by the Department have involved substan-

lowing casements. of manpower and rusources, as typitiod by the fol-

In March 1971, a violent explosion caused damages in excess of

$100,000 to the original Senate wing of the U.S. Capitol. this tollowed

an anonymous call to the ettect that the Capitol would be blown up

in 30 minutes as a protest against military operations in Laos. Exten-

sive investigation by the FBI is continuing and the matter is pending

before a Federal grand jury.

During the late evening of October 14. 1971, the Iranian Consulate

at San francisco. Calit., was extensively damaged by an explosion.

Damages to the Consulate and surrounding property were estimated

at approximately s1 million. Intensive investigation to identify all

persons responsible is continuing.

In July 1970, a Federal grand jury at Detroit, Nich, indicted 18

members of the Yeatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic

Society, charging them with conspiracy to violate Federal bombing

and gun control statutes. The indictment charged that the conspiracy

originated during a meeting of the leadership of the Students tor a

Democratic Society at flint, alich. during Necember 1969, and that

various overt acts. including bombings, attempted bombings and pur-

chases of explosives, followed that meeting. Five of the detendants

are presently tree on bond, charges against one of the defendants were

dismissed in February 1971 at the request of the Government and the

other seven defendants are being sought as fugitives.

News media in several cities receired handprinted letters in Jan-

uary 1972 warning that during July 1971 nine unusual prototype

bombs mere planted in difterent banks across the country. The let-

ters stated that similar devices could be used to demand the release of

"political" prisoners." Explosive devices were located in safe deposit

boses in banks in Chicago, San Francisco, and New York City. These

devices were bombs constructed of battery-powered calendar clocks,

photographic flash bulbs and black powder. The bombs were capable

REPORTS ON BOMBING INCIDENTS

For over a year the FBI has been collecting detailed information on

bombing incidents through its field offices. This data identifies the num-

ber of bombing incidents. types of devices, types of targets, and the

like. Beginning in January 1972, a program was instituted within the

FBI to disseminate this information on a monthly, quarterly and an-

nual basis to all law enforcement agencies through the Uniform Crime

Reporting program. This is another FBI service to keep local, State

and Federal law enforcement agencies fully informed.

BODIB THREATS AGAINST FBI FACILITIES

During the 1971 calendar year, there were 170 bomb threats against

FBI facilities or buildings housing F BI facilities. Each of these insidi-

ous harrassments forces us to assign a certain amount of manpower

to perform the required search of our space.

ESPIONAGE AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE

• Although shifting political winds periodically cause an individual

communist nation to deviate somewhat to the left or right of its set

course, there has been no indication that any has abandoned its resolve

to undermine the security of the United States through espionage and

subversion.

THE SOVIET BLOC

The Soviet espionage services continue to lead in the intensity of

these efforts and the other Soviet-bloc nations complement their

efforts in rarying degrees.

As has been true over the years, these communist intelligence agen-

cies, shie wor intely enge active es the State as the in enemy?

establishments in the United States. Soviet-bloc official personnel in

this country hare been increasing in number over the years and as 01

February 1, 1972, the count was 2,593, consisting of 1.166 officials anc

1,427 dependents. Not included in the count are couriers, members of

special delegations and other officials temporarily in the United States

but not assigned to omcial establishmenis.

These charts which I offer to the Chairman show the build-up of

Soviet-bloc personnel in the United States since 1967 and a current

breakdown of official personnel by country.

Mr. RooNer. We shall insert these charts at this point in the record.

Tele:

The recent decision of the Supreno Court entitled Irvine+.

Calzoazza, 307 0.5. 123, dendincing the use of microphone surveillances

by city police in a gamblina casa makes appropriate a reampraisal of

the use which may be made in the future by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation of microonone surveillance in connection with matiers

relaiing to the intemal security of the country.

It is clear that in some instances the use of microphone

sure?lence do the only receipts moy of uncoverina the activities

cê capionage agents, mosible sahoto's

;.ard subversive persons, In

such insuances I an of the opinion that the national interest reauires

that microphone curreillance be uilized by the federal Bureau of

Investigation.

This ase need not be limited to the development oi

criconce for prosecution.

The EST has an intelligence function in

connection with internal security matters coually as important as

the duur of developing evidence lor presentation to the courts and

the national security requires that the Ful be abie to use microprore

surveillance for he proper discharge of both of such functions.

The Department of Justice approves the use of microphone surveillance

by the fBi under chese circumstances and for these purposes.

I do not consider that the decision of the Supreme Court

in Izzine v. Califonia, supra, requires a different course.

That

case is readily castinguishable on its incts. Ihe language of the

Court, however, indicates cortain uses of microphones which at would

be well to avoid, is possible, even in internal security inrostigu-

tions.

It is quite clear that in the Irvine case the Justices of the

Supione Court were outraged by what they regarded as the indecency of

installing a nicrophone in a bedroom. They denounced the utilization

of such methods of investigation in a gambling case as shocking.

Court's action is a clear incication oi the need lor discretion and

intelligent restraint in the use of microphones by the FBI in all

cases, including intomal security matters. Obviously, the insialla-

tion

oê a nicrophone in a borroom or in some comparably intimate

Location should be avoided werever possible. It may appear, however,

that imporant intelligence or evidence relating io metical connected

with the national. securiur can only be obtained by the installation oi

a micropinone in such a locution. It is my opinion. that under such

circustances the installation is proper and is not prohibited by tho

Previous interpretations nich have been fumished to you

as to what nay consüitute trespass in the installation oi microphones,

suggest that the viers enpressed have boon tentative in nature ma

have attempted to predict the course which courts would follow

rather than refleci the present state of the lai. It is realizod

that not infrequently the question oi trespass arises in connection

with the installation oi a microphone. The question of whether a

trespass is actually involved and the second question of the effect

oi such a trespass upon the acmissibility in court of the evidence thus

obtained, must necessarily be resolved according to the circunstences

of each case. The Departrent in resolving the problens which may arise

in connection with the use ai microphone suveillance will revica tho

circunstances in each case in the light of the práctical necessities

of investigation and oî the national interest which must be protocted.

It is my opinion that the lepartment should acout that interpretation

which will permit microphone covcrage by the FBI in a manner most

conducive to our national interest.

I recognize that for the FBI.

to fulêill its important intelligence function, considerations of.

GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

Fundamental to

investigations by the

FBI is

the need to protoct the

constitutiona1

rIghts of any individual while still

thoroughly and

expeditiously discharging those responsibilities with which it is charged

by statutes and Directives of the

President and the Attorney General.

The FBI is a fact-finding agency which sooks

with equal vigor to gathor

evidence which will aid

the successful prosecution, or establish the

innocence, of alloged violators of laws of the United States or of those

who are accused of seeking by force to subvert or overthrow the Government

of the United Statos.

The FBI makes no determination of the guilt or

innocence of any individual or group so accused.

To this end, guidelines have beon established to be followed in the

investigation of cases falling within the jurisdiction of the FBI, to

prevent unwarranted investigations and invasions of the constitutional rights

of any person.

IB. [SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS

In matters affecting the security of the United States, under no circumstance

is an investigation conducted of any individual on the basis that such indi-

vidual supports unpopular causes or opposes Government policies. All inves-

tigations of

subversive or extremist activities are directed to the collection

of information pertinent to a determination as to whether or not the subject

has violated, or is engaged in activities which may result in a violation of,

one of several specifically enumerated Federal statutes; or are in fulfill-

ment of instructions from the Department of Justice. All communications re-

garaing these cases must be limited to intormation regarding the subject's

subversive activities,

sympathies and affiliations; pertinent background data

covering subversive individuals or groups with which the subject is connected;

and essential background data regarding the subject. No electronic surveil-

lance may be instituted without the specific authority of the Attorney General.

PIiOI FBIHQ approval is required to institute an investigation of a faculty

member or an organization connected with an institution of learning or to

interview a student or faculty member other than established sources. Inves~

tigations of foreign diplomatic or official personnel are not instituted with~

specific approval by FBIHQ and clearance from the Department of State.

No investigations are conducted of active or retired members of the U. s.

nilitary forces under terms of a delimitations agreement entered into betweer

;he FBI and the counterintelligence services of the armed forces..

c.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGINCE - ORGANIZED CRIME

Where matters of a criminal intelligence nature or organized crime are

concerned, investigations are conducted to develon and maintain current

information

on the activities of organized crime in general, and to develop

substantive cases against individual racket figures.

These investigations

are highly selective and are

,concentrated on the leaders of organized crime

and their reported associates.

Any electronic surveillance used in these

investigations requires approval of the Bureau, the Attorney General, ana

authorization by a court order.

D. APPLICANT-TYPE MATTERS

In the area of applicant investigations, specilic standards have been

established to protect the rights of individuals.

111 relevant information,

both favorable and unfavorable, obtained concerning an individual must be

duly reported; investigation is linited to checks of pertinent records and

interviews of persons in a position to furnish rolevant information; persons

furnishing derogatory information are requested to furnish a signed statement.

The FBI makes no evaluation or recommendation to the requesting agency

concerning the applicant.

PREFACE.

GUIDELINES FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS

IE..

GENERAL CRIMINAL AND CIV

MATTERS

Our investigative iurisdiction in criminal cases is based on

specific

violations of Federal laws.

Investigations aro conducted when information

is receiveà indicating a violation of a Federal law, over which we have been

given investigative

jurisciction,

Results of our invostigations

are fürnished

to United States Atiorneys or the Department of Justice for

determination

uf the course of any prosecutive action.

The decision may be

made to present the

case to a Federal Grand Jury or, if the facts so justify,

to arrest the subject, in which latter instance the arrest is made on the

basis of authorizod prosecution and the issuance of a marrant.

Upon arrest,

the subject must be brought before

nezrest United States Magistrate or

Federal Judge in accordance with established rules of Federal criminal

procedure.

Requests for FBI investigations in selected civil matters in which the United

States is or may

be a party in interest are received from the Unitad States

• Attornoys and/or tho Depariment of Justice.

These are handled in strict

conformity with guidelines furnished by the Department of Justice, as are also

.investigations ol violations of the civil rights, antiriot, election laws,

and antitrust laws.

iF.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

In addition to thase principles, numerous other restrictions apply to all

phases of our work.

For example, our authority to arrest fugitives is

statutory.

The United States Code empowers Special Agents to make arrests

and carry firearms but FBI policy further requires that' only that force may

be used which is necessary

to effect arrest with due regard being observed

for the safety of the arresting officers and others.

Special Agents are not permitted to shoot anyone except in self-defense.

No surveillances are conducted in the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme

court, or the House and Senate Office Buildings.

No surveillance, electronic

or otherwise, may be instituted on any member of Congress, any Justice or

Judge, or any principal functionary of the Execative Branch.

Our Special

Agent's may not engage in entrapment or any other improper, illegal, or

unethical tactics in procuring infornation or evidence; any critical

complaints concerning FBI personnel must be thoroughly investigated; any

testimony by a Specizl Agent

in court must be

given clearly and without bias

or embellishment.

Ihe foregoing is a goneral statement of guidelines for iBI invostigations.

All investigative personnel must follow these rules.

The section is zined at the substance of the proscribed

information,

not at the ast of making it more readily available for use."

Based on Hoine

decision, it appears Government must prove that information

gathered

or transmitted

to some degree limited or restricted and not

available to general public.

DEPARTMENTAL INSTRUCTIONS [(UNCLASSIFIED) ]

According to Department, prohibitions in

section 793(a) b are conditioned

upon suspect having

the purpose of obtaining information respecting

defense with intent or reason to believe

that it is

to be used

Injury of U.S. or advantage of any foreign nation; those in subdivision

(c) require

same purpose plus suspect's knowledge or reason to believe that

it will be used contrary to espionage laws; subdivisions (d and

(e) relate

to suspects who already nave possession of

or access. to information relating

to national defense, either lawfully or unlawfully, which they have reason

to believe could be

used to injury of u. s.

or to advantage of any foreign

sation, and ino willfully transmit it to unauthorized persons or retain it

after demand made by person authorized to receive it la demand is onl

necessary under subdivision (a) where individual has lawful possession - no

demand is necessary under subdivision (a) where person has unauthorized

possession); subdivision (1) applies to suspects who have lawful possession

of national defense information and pernit it to be lost or destroyed through

gross negligence or fail to report its loss to proper authorities.

Department has instructed all USAs that its prior authorization is necessary

before instituting prosecutive action in espionage cases, except in emergency

where subiect is fuéitive or damade may result from delay.

In cases involving photographing violations, Department has advised such

cases can be more expeditiously handled by presenting directly to USA for

•preliminary opinion.

This does not alter.policy of presenting all espionage

cases to Department prior to actual prosecution:

Concerning section 798, Department has advised that classification may be

by written directive,

or by marking or stamping on item classified;

authorization may be established by written directive or oral testimony.

Decodes of unclassified information are covered by act where it can be proved

they facilitated analysis of cryptographic system.

Department holds that photographing or sketching of outside of commercial

establishment engaged in manufacture of classified military or naval arms

and munitions for U.S. Army, Navy, or Air Force would not constitute violation

of section 795 and/or 797, where no classified equipment or material appears

in photograph or sketch.

Department has suggested following procedurés

when obtaining and returning

photographs taken in violation of section 795:

Subject should be requested

to relinquish film.

Receipt should be given to subject and signed statement

film is being voluntarily relinquished. Film taken in

connection with section 795 should be submitted to FBI Laboratory for any

necessary processing and

should then be submitted to commanding officer of

military post, or othar

installation, for censorship. If film contains

photographs in violation

of section 795, it should be delivered to USA either

airectly by commanding officer or through Bureau.

prosecution deemed advisable, film should be retained as evidence and not

returned to subject unless, at

conclusion of case, USA feels that any innocuous

negatives or prints may be

returned. In such event film should be returned

As to rights of Bureau Agents in carrying out enforcement procedures regarding

violations

of sections 795 and 796 by Soviet-bloc diplomatic and official

personnel, Department advised in summary as follows:

In all instances in which photographs or sketches

of delense installations are

made by Soviet-bloc nationals, every reasonable effort should

be made to

recover and confiscate these items in interest of national security.

Soviet-bloc nationals who have no diplomatic immunity are observed by Bureau

Agents to photograph or sketch

military installations in violation of

sections 795 and 796, they may be arrested without warrant and film seized

as evidence.

If observation is by person other than Bureau Agent, an arrest

warrant should be procured

(because misdemeanor rather than a felony is

involved) and search warrant obtained il premises are involved.

Where Soviet-bloc or other foreign officials who may have diplomatic immunity

are observed taking photographs by Bureau Agents, they may be detained until

Burezu is satisfied they do in fact have immunity and film may be confiscated

in interest of national security.

If Agents do not actually observe the

activity but received information from outside source, film may not be legally

since warrant of arrest or search may not be lawfully executed against

person or

premises naving diplomatic immunity.

if possible, allegations can be established

or disproved.

Whore nonspecific complaint is received which is vague and indefi-

is being corducted.

However, this does not mean that before case

opened, full or substantial evidence must be on hand. Il responsible

sources, published data, confidential informants, double agenis, or

any reliable citizen makes allegation which would indicate espionage

activities, careful consideration should be given to matter before

decision is made not to initiate investigation.

Investigation of diplomatic or other foreign official personnel, in-

Act, should not be instiuted without prior Bureau authority.

ever, in emergency situations, discreet physical surveillances may be

conducted of such persons apparently acting outside scope of their

authority.

In such instances immediately advise Bureau.

5. Conducting investigations [(SECRET)]

a.

Investigations must be complete,

tnorough, and expeditzousLy nanaled.

Bureau

should be kept currently advised

of

important dovelopments.

Determine at earliest possible timo

whether allegations have any pos-

sible basis in fact in

order to conserve Agents' time and efforts.

b.

Only photographing cases should be presented to USAs for

preliminary

prosecutive opinion.

Do not contact USAs regarding violations of

other statutes, but

submit to Bureau for presentation to Department.

FBI Agents may photograph, sketch, or make graphic representations

of military or naval installations or equipment without obtaining

permission from commanding officer or higher authority when request

for investigation has emanated from latter

Cr

where urgent nature of

Investigation prevents obtaining such permission.

In latter instance,

photographs, etc., should be submitted promptly to commanding officér

or higher authority for review.

d.

Pursuant to consultations with Department of State and Department con-.

cerning violations of sections 795 and 796 by Sovieï-bloc diplomatic

and official personnel, be guided by following instructions:

Exocutive Order 10104, which defines defenso installations covered by

sections 795 and 796, specifies that installations or equipment must

be classified,

designated, or marked

prior to any arrests

of any diplomatic personnel or memors of thoir staffs (including persons

affiliatod with embassies, legations, etc., and missions to UN) or

INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE [(SECRET)]

1.

Investigation should

be based on premise alleged intelligonce officers

and their agents have been thoroughly trained and their activities

directed by experts.

Most successful

spy is ordinary-appearing person,

who has established

an excellent "cover"

for his activities.

2.

Principal goal is providing adequate protection to national

defense.

tain counterintelligence measures frequently will be more desirable than

immediate apprehension and

prosecution.

It may be desirable to permit

subject to remain at large, whereby cuntinuing surveillance may disclose

information as to his associates, targets, or accomplices.

Every pre-

must be used to prevent subject from becoming

aware of our investi-

Climax of any espionage case is actual transmittal or disclosure of infor

mation affecting national defense to foreign government or its representa-

Investigations should be

view to determining as soon

as possible actual method by which information involved is being transmitted

to foreign government or its representative.

It may become necessary in

some instances to make an arrest to prevent

transmission of classified in-

formation known to be in possession of a subject or to prevent his escape

with information.

Although not all-inclusive, following investigative steps should be con-

Make every effort to corrob-

orate conversations between informants or double agents and subject

in order that admissible evidence may be available to corroborate in-

formant or double agent.

Make sure latter interprets instructions

correctly and have such instructions properly recorded.

Ascertain method and nature of communications, including mail drops,

through:

Use of highly confidential techniques.

This is very important

and should be considered whenever security is assured.

service with which he is connected, including setup of files section and

how their material is coordinated.

Identities

There is definite difference between a cipher and a code.

A cipher is

made by using individual letters of messago as units.

This may

done eithor by substituting numbers, symbols, or other letters lor

original letters in message; or by rearranging order of letters

Investigative juriscaction

sil investigations under this soction are based on specific statutory

jurisdiction and Departmental instructions.

Investigations conducted under this section are to be directed to the

gathering of material pertinent to a determination whether or not the

subject has violated, or is engaged in activities which may result in

a violation of, one

or more of

the statutes enumerated below; or in

fulfillment of

Departnental instructions.

There are

three principal statutes which provide a basis for these

investigations, as follows:

Rebellion of insuirection (T18, USC § 2383).

"Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists

engages in any rebellion

or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the

laws thereof, or gives aid of comfort thereto, shall be fined not

more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both;

and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States."'

Seditious conspiracy (TIS, USC § 2384).

"If two or more persons In any

State or Territory, or in any place

subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to over-

United but down, or to destroy by force the Government of the

States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force

the authority

thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the

execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take.

or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authorit

thereof, they shall each be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned

"If two or more persons conspire to commit any offense named' in this

section, each shall be fined not more than $20,000 or imprisoned

not more than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for

employment by the United States of any department of agency thereof,

for the five years next following his conviction.

"As used in this section, the terms 'organizes' and 'organize', with

respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include the

recruiting of

new members, the forming of new units, and the regroup-

ing or expansion of existing clubs,

classes,

and other units of

society, group, or assembly of persons."

The courts have interpreted this statute to require advocacy to

action, l.e., advocacy to do something, now or in the future, rather

than merely to believe In something•

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, there

are two other statutes which might provide a statutory foundation for

an investigation under this section.

These

under this Section.

This Act makes it unlawful to knowingly

within the United States which is controlled by a foreign

government, organization, or individual.]

2e Prosecutive determination

All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investigations

initiated under this section will be conducted by FBIHQ with Departmental

officials.

These cases should not be discussed with local U. S. Attorney's

office without FBIHQ approval.

3.

Related statutes

There are a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative

jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handiing these investigations.

Information concerning possibie violations of

such statutes is frequently

developed during

these investigations.

Where this occurs the field should

consider the desirability of conducting investigation in line with the

policies and procedures governing the statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investigations

is outlined in an appendix to this manual.

Definitions

The term "subversive activities" as used in this section denotés

activities which are aimed at overthrowing.

destroying or undermining the

Government of the United States of any of its political subdivisions by

the illegal means prohibited by statutes enumerated in A. 1. above. The

term "'subversive organization" or

"'subversive movement" denotes a group

or movement which is known to engage in or advocate subversive activities,

as defined above.

specifically the statute upon which the investigation is based

together with necessary supporting facts. Where investigation has been

specifically requested by Department, this should be indicated.

following examples

are illustrative; however, the basis for each

indivichal. case must be tailored to the circumstances of such case.

"This investigation is based on information that the subject's

activities could involve violation of I 18, USC, $ 2383 (Rebellion

or Insurrection), and § 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy). A source whose

reliabilily has not been determined has informed that the subject

is planning, along with others, to travel to Washington, D. Co,

on April 30

1971, to participate in planned violent demonstrations

during the first week

in May, 1971, to 'shut down the Government.'

Demonstration plans include the blocking of streets and highways,

destruction of personal and Government property, and physical

obstruction to prevent Government employees from reporting to work."

"This investigation is based on information that the subject's

activities couid involve a violation of I 18, USC, $ 2385 (Advocating

the overthrow of the Government).

The subject is an admitted member

(or has been identified as a member by a confidential source who

has provided reliable information in the past) of (nane of group).

The (name of

group) in its public statements and publications

advocates the desirability and

necessity of overthrowing

the U.S.

Government by force or violence, and the assassination of U.S.

Government officers.

The same source has reported that the subject

actively supporis these positions."

the first intra-Bureau communication prepared which

Where possible investigation is beinglconductedlshould specifically

indicates that

indicate the

statutory

• basis for the

investigation. However, there

may be occasions

involving individuals of groups in contact with known

subversive clements where the purpose of the contact is not initially

known and where a preliminary inquiry must be made to determine

whether a statutory basis exists for full investigation.

In these

instances, a preliminary inquiry may be undertaken, through estab-

lished sources, for a period not to exceed 90 days, without specifically

specific statutory basis for the inquiry.

If after the

conclusion of 90 days it has not been possible to establish a

statutory basis but further inquiry appears necessay, FBIHQ must

be furnished a succinct summary of

the facts by letter together with

specific reconmendations as to further action. In all cases, oi

course, investigations must be based on indications that subject

may be engaged in subversive activity, whether or not a specific

statutory basis is cited.

In the event preliminary inquiries fail to establish a sound basis

for investigation, the case should be promptly closed and there is

no need to advise

FBIHQ (unless FBIHQ has been previously advised

of the inquiry).

Nor is there any need to prepare an LIM or report

where no pertinent subversive derogatory information has been developed.

If the statutory basis for an investigation should change or be

expanded to include an additional statute or statutes, the first

communication prepared subsequent to such change or expansion should

specifically show such changes.

Similarly, this information should

be included in the next report or LHM prepared in the case.

ecret Service..

Under

agreement

between FBI and

Secret Service

concerning protective

responsibilities (set out' in section 102, volume IV; of

tli's mariual);

reports and LIMs are disseminated to Secret Service both locally

and at FBIIIQ in all cases which meet standards set forth.

This

includes virtually all cases on individuals where any substantial

information exists as to subversive activities or sympathies of

subject.

When photographs are available send copies to Secret

locally and to FBIHQ for dissemination at headquarters

Secret Service should be advised of reason for referral; i.e.,

statement of class or classes of agreement which apply to

subject.

FD-376 serves as letter of transmittal for both local

and FBIHQ dissemination.

Forward original and one copy to FBINQ

(2)

maintain copy in case file.

After initial dissemination, as changes occur in residence and

employment, advise Secret Service locally by FD-366 and furnish

two copies

to FBIHQ. FD-366 must be submitted even though changes

in residence and/or employment are noted in report or LIM being

submitted.

(3)

For instructions governing dissemination-to Secret Service in

matters involving threats against President, refer

to section

134B, volume IV

of this manual.

(4)

Upon

transfer of office of origin, old office of origin should

furnish Secret Service locally with subject's new residence and

business address by LIM or FD-366. Provide copies to FBIHQ and

new office of origin for dissemination to Secret Service head-

quarters and branch office covering new residence, respectively.

(5)

As an administrative ald to insure proper dissemination, the Ille

covers of cases in which dissemination is being made to

Secrei

Service may be stamped "SS."

3. 'Restrictions on field dissemination

If security measures are known to be inadequate at local office of

another Government agency, do not disseminate locally: but bring matter

to attention of FBIHQ for

headquarters dissemination.

E. ADMINISTRATIVE INDEX (ADEX)

1.

Purpose and general policy

a.

To have a readily available and up-to-date listing of individuals

deemed currently dangerous to the national security.

Objective is to

identify individuals who should be afforded priority investigative

coverage in the event of a national emergency.

b.. Under no circumstance should individuals be included in ADEX merely

because of their opposition to Government policies or because of the

exercise of their constitutional rights of protest and dissent.

ADEX is strictly an administrative device. It should not be treated

as a factor in determining basic investigative decisions, 1.e..

whether an investigation should be opened or closed, the extent of

investigation to be conducted in a particular case, etc.

ADEX should include individuals whose actions or statements have

established that they represent a current threat to the national

security, i.e.,:

Individuals (whether affiliated with organized groups or not) who

government officials, or other

such acts which would result in interference with or a threat to

the survival and effective operation of national, state or local

government.

The term "leaders"

denotes those individuals, irrespective

of title, who are in a position to significantly influence the

policies or direct the activities of the group. Mere membership

in an organization, without the element of leadership or without a

demonstrated willingness and capability described in paragraph a,

is not sufficient for inclusion in ADEX.

Individuals should be considered a "current threat" to the national

security when reliable information has been developed that they have

engaged in activity or exhibited the requisite willingness and capability

falling within the above-described criteria during prior two years

and there is no indication they have ceased such activity. However,

there may be instances where retention of an individual in ADEX is

justified even though no pertinent information is available during

sible reactivation on ADEX•

whether or not a stop can be placed,

necessary administrative procedure should be set up so that sub-

juiis uniinued incarceration is verniled at least every

six months.

If case is not pending, it should be placed in a pending inactive

rather than closed status. If a subject under investigation appears

to qualify for ADEX but is under sentence for over two years as de~

scribed above, do not recommend for ADEX but follow procedures

described above to consider for ADEX upon release from imprisonment.

Sentences which permit releases in less than to years should be ignored

as a factor in considering ADEX status.

These guidelines are for

application only as to ADEX status and have no

bearing on whether or

not subjects should be investigated.

For those cases in a closed

status at time these new guidelines become effective, they should be

brought in line with the

new guidelines when the cases are next

reviewed for any reason.

ADEX should not include individuals who may be ideologically committed

to a philosophy which calls for the downfall of our form of

or which favors another form of society but who have not shown a current

Willingness or capability of engaging in meaningful action to promote

their beliefs.

This might apply, for example, to rank-and-file members

of the Socialist Workers Party or the Communist Party, USA, or other .

our present form of government but where subject's activity is .

primarily ideological in nature and not oriented toward action.

case should be reviewed on an individual basis in the light of the

criteria enumerated above.

Recommendation for preparation of ADEX card

When dangerousness of

subject has been

established, office of origin

should prepare recommendation on. FD-122, in triplicate.

Forward,

original and

copy to FBIHQ, and place copy in subject's file.

bo Attach additional page or pages to FD-122 setting out succinct

summary of facts on which recommendation based.

STEP TAKEN BY COMMUNIST PARTY, USA, TO AVOID PROSECUTION UNDER THIS ACT

I'he Communist Party,

USA, held

a special convention

in New York City on

November 16 to 17, 1940.

This convention declared "that the Communist Party

of the USA in convention assembled, does bereby cancel and dissolve its organi-

zational affiliation with the Communist International, as well as any and all

other bodies of any kind outside the boundaries of the United States of America

for the specific purpose of renoving itself from the terms

of the socalled

Voorhis Act."

DEPARTMENTAL POLICY

(In 1941,

the Department considered holding grand jury hearings under this

act at which leading Communist Party lunctionaries would be subpoenaed.

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor

stopped any action in this resara.

Then prosecutive action was initiated against the Communist Party and it:

in a violation of one or more of the statutes enumerated below or in

fulfillment of Departmental instructions.

There are three principal statutes which provide a basis for these

investigations, as follows:

Rebellion or

"Whoever incites,

with respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons,

include the recruiting of new members,

the forming of new

and the regrouping or expansion of existing clubs, classes,

The

courts have interpreted this statute to.reguire advocacy to

action, i.e., advocacy to do something, now or in the future,

rather

than merely to believe in something.

In addition to the three principal statutes outlined above, the follow

ing statute would pertain to investigations of. Klan and other white

hate groups.

Civil Rights Act of 1968 (T18, USC, §241)

In summary, this statute makes it unlawful for two or more

persons to

conspire to injure,

any citizen in the free exercise of enjoyment en, of intimidate

any right or

privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of

United States.

Additionally, it prohibits two or more persons'

going in disguise on

the highway or on the premises of

with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment

of any rights secured by the Constitution or the laws of the

Prosecutive

Determination

All discussions pertaining to the prosecutive potential of investi-

gations initiated under this section will be conducted by FBIHQ with

Departmental officials.

These cases should not be discussed with

1ócal U.

Attorney's office without FBIHQ approval.

Related Statutes

There are

a number of other statutes under the FBI's investigative

jurisdiction which should be borne in mind in handling these investi

Es frequently developed during these investigations.

Information concerning possible violations of such statutes

investigation in line with the policies and procedures governing the

statute in question.

A list of other Federal statutes which may arise during these investi-

gations is outlined in Subsection 9 of this section.

APPENDIX B

PERIODS OF PREDOMINANT MILITARY

INTERESTS:

NOT INVOLVING MARTINE LAW

1.

In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as

potential theaters of operation. When an armed forces commander

of such a potential theater Is designated, he definitely nas

interest in, though not control of, the civilian life within the

area.

In order that the armed. forces commander.may prepare him-

self for the discharge of the possible responsibility which may

affix to him, the following procedure is agreed upon:

U.S. Air Force will continue to function in accordance with the

Air

Agents of the FBI; of ONI; ID, Army; and the OSI,

IG,

provisions of sections II, III, IV, and V. .

2. In addition thereto, the armed forces commander may take

steps to analyze the facilities existing.and to explore the

manner in which complete coverage will be obtained if martial law

is declared. Adequate liaison with the other subscribing agencies

will insure

that the armed forces commander will have the henetit

of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the representatives

of the other agencies.

3. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and

receive such information from the other three agencies as he may

desire and they may be able to furnish.

:.

II.

The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the

coverage furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any

additional coverage each subscribing agency can undertake. When

jurisdiction. Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally

coming under the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies,

the armed forces commander should obtain the necessary authority

from the Secretary of Defense.

III. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations

have placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces

commander, whenever any of the other services feel that such

a survey to determine adequacy of coverage should be undertaken,

it should be so recommended.

•Title XI of the captioned law amends Title 18, United

States Code, by adding a now chapter 40 with section numbers 9il

through 848 governing

the importation, manufacture, distribution

ane storage of explosive raterials and creating certain Federal

ortenses pertaining to the linlawful use of explosives.

involving explosive or incendiary devices sent through the mails

or directed against U.S. Postal Service property.

Title XI greatly broadens Federal auchority pertaining to

explosives-connected offenses.

At the same time, Congress has

expressly disclalred any. intent to occupy the field to the exclusion

of state law on the same subject matter.:

To effect both Congressional

purposes and to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort it is

essential that the limited Federal investigative resources be carafully

allocated, particularly in cases in which both the ATf and the FBI

have jurisdiction.

2. Federal Bureau of Investiration (FBI) Jurisdiction in General

only to those incidents as to nich the Ful had no investigative

offender is identified, all available information will be disseminated

as indicated in paragraph 6 below.

(b) Use/carrying explosive in commission of a felony

property or functions (paragraph 2(b) above) require immediate full

federal investigation.

Lion of factors pertinent to the exercise of Federal jurisdiction.

Accordingly, in those incidents which these guidelines do not prescribe

immediate full investigation, the investigative ayency having juris-

diccion will develop background information which includes (a) facts
