EISENHOWER PROTECTIVE DIVISION

PROTECIIVE INTELLIGENCE

SITUATION REPORT

Whoever occupies the Presidency also inherits the incipient dangers

that it is the duty, by law, of the Secret Service to combat. The

past decade, with its improved news media coverage has emphasized

the role of the President's wife upon the world's political and

emotional scene.. In view of the foregoing, the "First Lady", now,

more than ever before, acquires the image associated with her Presi-

dent husband. Should the President pass on, either while in or out

of office, his widow will, in varying degrees, fall heir to many of

the dangerous and/or varying annoyances that had beset her husband.

In essence - the security requirements needed to sustain a reason-

ably normal evironmental atmosphere for the situation of "president

and First Lady" are also required with modification, for the situa-

tion of "First Lady".

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, EISENHOWER PROTECTIVE DETAIL,

In Septenber 1965, Federal Law became effective which provided former

Presidents with the opportunity to acquire a protective detail fron

the Secret Service. Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower gratefully

acœepted such coverage and stated clearly that his prime motivation

was his great concern for the safety of Mrs. Eisenhower.

With the wishes of former President Eisenhower in mind, the Seccet

Service has been involved with almost equal concentration upon the

needs of Mrs. Eisenhower. The security confidence that has been

established between Mrs. Eisenhower and the Secret Service has de-

veloped to the extent where she has publically stated she cannot

feel safe except with our agents present.

Mrs. Eisenhower has directly related her appreciation of Secret Ser-

viœ efforts to President Johnson and Secretary of the Treasury

Fonler; further, discontinuance of such coverage would constitute

a loss she cannot absorb.

EVALUATION OF DISTAFF SECURITY NEEDS

The problem of mail as a prelude to physical violence, real or pre-

tended and/or a source of mental anguish is presented in the Intelli-

gence Division Report. It becomes a matter of prime concern, however,

when one must consider that as much as 60,000 items of mail may be

processed by General Bisenhover's Offio in a given year. Prior to

the arrival of the Secret Service Detail, there were several occasions

when threatening and abusive mail was to the extreme degree that

assistance fran the F.B.I. was requested, and granted, to resolve

the individual problem at hand.

State and local authorities have

also been utilized in many similar circumstances. However, such

efforts were piece meal and follow-up activities were insufficient.

Herein lies a problem in communication and coordination between geo-

graphical locations and various law enforcement agencies. The Secret

Servica now has the capabilities, not only at a state or national

level, but on a world-wide basis.

Telephone calls present the same basic problems as mentioned above.

However, the present telephonic procedures are such that the Secret

Service screens out any undesirable callers. To accomplish this,

an agent has for all intent and purpose become Mrs. Eisenhower's

quasi, social and business secretary. In this capacity, business

and social engagements, as well as press exposure and travel arrange-

ments, are under strict control of an agent.

EFFECT OF SECURITY MEASURES

Shortly after General Eisenhower left the Presidency, Mrs. Eisenhower's

car was burglarized of personal property and various items of medical

equipment. Also, on many occasions, persons would trespass on the

Eisenhower Far at Gettysburg, which would frighten Mrs. Eisenhower.

The above took place prior to the assignment of the Secret Service to

the Fisenhowers.

trespassers, not only at Gettysburg but other temporary winter resi-

dences. The Service also instituted a program of automobile security

and proper car maintenance which has eliminated both the theft and road

breakdown problems.

Mrs. Eisenhower also keeps large amounts of jewelry which is of great

intrinsic, personal and historical value at the Farn.

She is in the

habit of carrying much of this jewelry with her when she travels. The

presence of the Secret Service agents has substantially decreased her

anxiety regarding these items.

Other than the obvious physical protection afforded Mrs. Eisenhower by

this Service is the aid to her in avoiding embarrassing situations in-

volving harmless and well-meaning people such as is the following:

Each year Mrs. Eisenhower attends a benefit fashion show in Palm Desert,

Califomia, and each year is accosted by the same elderly lady, who

appears harmless but insists on talking endlessly to Mrs. Eisenhower.

The Secret Service has been able to arrange program activities to avoia

this embarrassing situation.

CONFIDENTIAL

## Page 5

- 3 -

Another similar situation was avoided at an important function at

the Plaza Hotel in New York City when General Eisenhower was es-

corted to a position at the head table. However, Mrs. Eisenhower

had inadvertently been overlooked. The Secret Service, through

advance planning, was able to arrange escort to Mrs. Eisenhover

to a front table without embarrassment to anyone. Instances such

as the above occur daily when the Secret Service travels with

General and Mrs. Eisenhower.

Mrs. Eisenhower has an inner ear problem which makes it difficult

for her to maintain balance. Thus, it becomes necessary for an

escort to be constantly at her side to assist her in maintaining

balance while standing, walking or using stairs.

Since General Fisenhower's recent serious illness, Mrs. Eisenhower

has voiced extreme concern as to her future should the General die

and the protection afforded by the Secret Service be discontinued.

SUBJECT:

Protective Intelligence Information Regarding Widows and Wives

of Foimer Presidents

2 (c)Ci)

2(c) (i)

A review has been made of all Intelligence Division files

and indices to determine the extent and type of interest

exhibited by subjects toward former Presidents, their

wives, and widows. The review indicates a widow of a former

President receives substantially more attention from cranks

and individuals, both dangerous and not dangerous, than do

wives of former Presidents. This phenomenon seems to occur

because of a subject's tendency to transfer attention

previously directed toward the former President. Persons

who directed claims or threats against the former President

often continue to pursue their activity in regard to the

widow.

Subsequent to the assassination of President Kennedy,

individuals who previously expressed abnormal and sometimes

violent interest in the President directed their interest

toward Mrs. Kennedy and her children.

Brockton, Massachusetts, is representative of this group.

On September 12, 1961, he threatened to shoot President

Kennedy and even attempted to get a gun permit. On July ll,

1964, he appeared at Mrs. Kennedy's Hyannisport home to find

out from her why he had been placed in a mental institution

during her husate a konat share en response.

Three new groups of abnormal individuals appeared, following

the President's assassination, and each subject exhibited

an undue and often violent preoccupation with Mrs. Kennedy

and her children.

One group concerns individuals who

attempted to obtain financial assistance from Mrs. Kennedy

because they considered her to be the widow of a wealthy

man. It is apparent the same opportunists will direct their

attention toward future widows of Presidents, making them

targets of mentally ill people, seeking financial assistance

for some bizarre invention and personal venture. Generally,

the "money seekers" are considered obnoxious, rather than

dangerous; however, our files contain several cases concerning

individuals who have exhibited violent tendencies when they

axe rebuffed in their financial pleas. They continue to ba

of New York, wrote an anonymous letter to Mrs. Kennedy on

April 21, 1964, demanding a gift of $10,000, stating "I

could kidnap your children and hold them for ransom".. She

has also been diagnosed as schizophrenic paranoid.

A second category includes men who exhibit amorous intentions

toward Mrs. Kennedy. These subjects, who are of course

mentally deranged, either propose marriage or express a desire

to enter into an illicit

relationship with her, as they feel

she is in need of companionship. Their "love" soon turns to

hate and their attitude is expressed in extremely obscene and

abusive letters. Some of these subjects make direct threats

against the life of Mrs. Kennedy. It is also not uncommon

for one of these subjects to focus his attention on the wives

of former Presidents. If they bacone widows, the subjects

will most certainly escalate their abnormal attention. On

General and Mrs. Eisenhower and Mr. and Mrs. Truman are also

the recipients of critical, abusive and threatening correspondence.

Wives of former Presidents are not immune to the attention of

mentally ill individuals. Many of these subjects focus their

attention on the wives of former Presidents because they feel

they can accomplish their mission of reaching the former

President through his wife. This Service considers those

subjects dangerous to former Presidents, and also dangerous

to the wives and widows of former Presidents. i

Extensive background investigations must be conducted to

permit the evaluation of subject's protective interest and

degree of danger. For example, those individuals who have a

sinister interest in Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy and wives of

former Presidents have the means to travel quickly from one

jurisdiction to another, both nationally and internationally.

Local law enforcement agencies rarely conduct such investigations.

nor do they furnish information concerning dangerous individuals

to other police agencies. If this Service was not responsible

for the protection of Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy, law enforcement

agencies in areas where she travels and resides would be

unaware of any threats against her life, except those which

occurred in their own respective jurisdiction.

The illustrations furnished in this memorandum do not show

the full scope of the problem concerning mentally ill and

dangerous individuals who have shown interest in Mrs. Jacqueline

Kennedy, General and Mrs. Eisenhower and Mr. and Mrs. Truman.

The Intelligence Division presently has files concerning 678

individuals who have expressed specific interest in a widow of

a President, Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy. Of this number, 252, by

action of statement, have directly or indirectly threatened

Mrs. Kennedy or her children. Investigations are still being

conducted by this Service every 90 days on 59 of the subjects

to pernit their evaluation and to confirm addresses, mental

condition, etc.

Two thousand, eight hundred and eighty seven (2,887) individuals

are of record because of their specific interest in General

and Mrs. Eisenhower. Of this number, 923 at one time were

considered dangerous; quarterly investigations are conducted

on 56 individuals still considered dangerous and exhibiting

a continued interest in General and Mrs. Eisenhower.

Two thousand, six hundred and forty six (2,646) Intelligence

Division files reflect specific interest was exhibited by

subjects for Mr. and Mrs. Truman. Of this number, 946 were

considered dangerous at one time.. Quarterly investigations

are currently being conducted on 23 individuals who continue

their interest in the trumans and are considered dangerous.

This Division has been advised of twenty-five (25) bomb threats and

civil demonstrations in and around the greater Kansas City area.

actual bombing has taken place in the Independence area, a minor ex-

plosion at the Patriotic Party headquarters (Minutemen headquarters) •

One riot of major proportion occurred in Kansas City. Immediate

evacuation for President and Mrs. Truman was planned, but not needed.

During the spring months, numerous tornadoes are sighted in the area

of Kansas City and Special Agents are at the residence in the event

the residence is struck or power is lost at the house.

SURVEILLANCE - Three (3)

Three (3) individuals were sighted on separate occasions near the resi-

dence acting in a suspicious manner and were kept under surveillance by

Special Agents of this Division until they departed the area.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE

During the period of hospitalization of the Former President., June 1966,

Mrs. Truman requested a Special Agent remain at the residence during the

hours of darkness. This is now done on a permanent basis.

All mail addressed to Margaret Truman Daniel in care of the Former Presi-

dent is checked by the fanily and turned over to this Division if circum-

stances warrant. Mrs. Truman has requested this Service to assist Mrs.

Daniel on several occasions, including trips to visit the Trumans and once

when there was a death in the family.

This family assistance usually con-

sists of ground transportation to and from airports.

The Truman residence is located at Truman Road and N. Delaware Streets.

Truman Road is a heavily traveled main street between Kansas City and

Independence, Missouri. Both streets are used as parade routes on

national holidays and other special occasions. The residence is lo-

cated .9 of a mile from the Truman Library and as a consequence is

visited by most of the tourists visiting

the Truman Library. It is

estimated that 25 to 35 percent of all visitors continue on to the

residence.

The actual visitor attendance figures provided by the

Director of the Truman Library for Fiscal Year 1968 is 178,243.

During the administration of President Eisenhower, a White House

staff member received an extortion letter and several obscene

photographs containing superimposed photographs of Mrs. Mamie Eisen-

Mrs. Richard Nixon and other public figures.

The letter de-

manded the delivery of $350,000 to a Baltimore, Maryland address.

The anonymous author threatened to distribute the obscene photographs

throughout the Washington, D. C. area if the money was not delivered.

Extensive investigation by this Service resulted in the identifi-

cation of the extortionist.

Although handwriting experts positively identified the subject

as the author of the extortion letter, prosecution was declined

by the U. S. Attomey's Office. Investigation also indicated the

subject was suffering from mental illness, but he was not sufficiently

ill to warrant commitment.

This case dramatically illustrates the abnormal attention often

directed toward wives of Presidents and Vice Presidents.

An individual who is presently a patient in the Medical Center

for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri, came to the attention

of the Secret Service

in 19s/ when he mailed an obscene and threat-

ening letter to Former President Eisenhower.

In 1962 the subject

was arrested by this Service after he threatened the life of

President Kernedy. He was comnitted to the Nedical Center for

Federal Prisoners

and subsequently released in August 1964. He

inmediately began writing obscene letters to Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy

and on June 28, 1965 he was arrested in Patterson, New Jersey for

threatening her life. He was again committed to a mental institution

and released nine (9) months later.

The subject's letters to Mrs. Kennedy continued and he expressed

a desire to marry her.

On one occasion he asked intervieving agents

to pass along his marriage proposal.

On other occasions he verbally

threatened to assault and kill any Secret Service Agent who attempted

to interview or arrest him.

The subject was indicted for mailing obscene letters to Mrs.

Kennedy on October 19, 1966, and sentenced to five (5) years imprison-

He is new serving his sentence in the Federal Medical Center.

Psychiatrists have described the subject as dangerous and schizophrenic.

The Secret Service still evaluates this subject as dangerous to Mrs.

Kennedy, and periodic inquiry is made every 90 days with Medical Center

officials to determine if the subject's condition has improved or

deteriorated. Copies of some of the obscene letters the subject has

authored are attached.

A 27 year old man living in Brooklyn, New York, began

telephoning staff members of Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy's

office in September, 1967. The subject professed his

love for Mrs. Kennedy and indicated his desire to marry

her. Investigation conducted by this Service determined

the subject was a former mental patient and had been

arrested for several offenses including larceny, breaking

and entering, false pretenses and "peeping tom".

On December 29, 1967, the subject mailed a lengthy,

obscene letter to Mrs. Kennedy relating his "love" for

her. On July 11, 1968, he was located and interviewed

in New York City by Special Agents of this Service.

He admitted making several telephone calls to Mrs. Kennedy's

office and authorship of the obacene letter. He stated,

"I have what she lacks and she can help me with my inter-

personal relationship".

Although the subject still demonstrates a desire to meet

Mrs. Kennedy, no grounds exist for judicial action.

This Service conducts an investigation every 90 days to

verify the subject's residence address and determine his

attitude toward Mrs. Kennedy. A copy of one page from the

rambling, obscene letter mailed to Mrs. Kennedy is enclosed.

On February 27, 1967 a patient at the Veterans Administration

Hospital, Washington, D. C., mailed an amorous letter to

Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy. When interviewed, the subjeet

advised he intended to see Mrs. Kennedy immediately upon

release from the hospital. The Veterans Adninistration

Hospital released the subject March 13, 1967 and it was

necessary to immediately re-conit him to St. Slizabeths

Hospital because he could not be dissuaded from traveling to

New York City to meet Mrs. Kennedy.

Paychiatrists treating

the subject advised he is infatuated with Mrs. Kennedy and

believes he must marzy her.

On March 30, the subject appeared before the District of

Columbia Mental Health Commission and at that time was

described by a psychiatrist as dangerous and schizophrenic.

During the hearing, the subject commented he would break

the arn of any Secret Service Agent who tried to keep him

from seeing Mrs. Kennedy-

On March 31, 1967, a letter was received from the subject

containing a threat against the life of the President.

It is noted the subject was still a patient at St. Elizabeths

Hospital at the time the letter was weitten. Prosecution of

the subject was authorized and he was later transferred to

the Distzict of Columbia Jail awaiting further prosecution.

The subject was eventually returned to St. Blizabeths

Hospital because of his mental condition and charges were

dismissed against him.

This Service continues to make inguiry each quarter with

doctors at St. Elizabeths Hospital to keep abreast of the

subject's mental condition and attitudes toward the President,

Mrs. Kennedy and other Principals. Copies of two of the

subject's letters are enclosed. The letter dated

March 16, 1967 contains a direct threat against the life of

the President.
