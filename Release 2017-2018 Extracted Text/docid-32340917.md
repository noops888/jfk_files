arm of the latter of these two groups and engages in

clandestine activities that are directed supposedly

against "communism"

It is "Zero" that recently

assassinated by bombing the Spanish official, whose

assassination has instead been claimed to be the work

of Basque separatists.

"Zero" would not involve

itself

with any Cuban organizations zero"

BOSCH, incidentally, has

nothing to do with Spain or

ARAUJO is

in connection with some bombing for the purpose of confusing

the authorities.

(Mention of "Zero" and "C4" was made during

he interview in view of the fact a supposed list of

local assassination targets came to light in Los Angeles

shortly after the assassination of TORRIENTE and because du)

of recent information attributed to AL 4120-PSI that

"Frente de Liberacion Nacional Cabana"

Cubana"

', "Abdala"

"Zero" and "C4" had formed a coalition).

Since ARAUJO moved to the Miami area,

"Brigade

2506" in Los Angeles has been led by FULGENCIO GIL.

Another leading member is one (ENU) LAMELAS.

GIL may

be characterized as

"radical"

in the sense of being

impatient towards policies which he feels would be

unlikely to accomplish anything. At least in the past

he seemed to be so disposed.

Nevertheless, he has

continued

so far as known to head "Brigade

2506" during

a period in which it has become less and less active.

No group called "Organizacion Cubana" is know

o have ever existed in the Los Angeles area or anywher‹

else and would seem to be simply a general term rather

than the actual name of an organization.

However,

10S A calls "Ca abous Accion Cubana" existed in the

years ago; but none of its

members are known to ARAUJO.

The only group in the Los Angeles area that

AT NORTH MIAMI, FLORIDA: In view of the above,

it is suggested that Miami contact ARAUJO, preferably:

through his employment and attempt to interview him

further in connection with his information, and in view

of his expressed willingness to help in connection with

such matters as "Cuban"

bombings, an his past contact with

BOSCH and his apparent access to sources in the Cuban

field in Los Angeles (despite his removal to Miami) as

well as in Miami, to consider him for possible development

in the Cuban field. It should be mentioned that while

his information about "Zero" as stated above could

suggest that he

does not believe. it was responsible

for the assassination of TORRIENTE,

the opposite is

in the case.

He was asked why "Zero" would wish to

assassinate TORRIENTE

and replied he did not know.

The

true import of his information is to assert that "Zero"

is a secret organization and would not involve itself

information His information about

with any Cuban organization as suggester fy AL 4120-PSI'

totally discounted in view of his family's alleged

should not belu)

• background in Spain.

It is further suggested that he

be specitically asked regarding his

statement that

"Comandos Accion Cubana"

existed in Los Angeles four

years ago, whether it

mation about it.
