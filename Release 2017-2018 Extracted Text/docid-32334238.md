On 9/29/66, the Columbia Division advised

contact

with appropriate informants has failed to develop any infor-

mation regarding subject's possible business contacts or

connections in that area.

Departmental' Attomey OWEN A. NEFF, New Orleans,

La., telephoned SA WILLIAM E. DUKES at Gulfport, Miss.,

on 8/30/66, and advised that, in view of the apparent

interest of CARLOS MARCELLO and HASKELL JONES of New Orleans

in this matter, as indicated by their recent presence in

a ta cater

Biloxi, Miss., a conference would be desirable with Jackson

and New Orleans Agents to discuss this development. Mr. NEFF

requested that SA WILLIAM F. DUKES and WILLIAM DEAN JANSEN

of the Gulfport Resident Agency,

Jackson Division, meet at

New Orleans on the morning of 9/1/66, with NEFF and SA's

REGIS I. KENNEDY and PATRICK I. COLLINS, JR.

Mr. NEFF

advised that after conversation with USA ROBERT E. HAUBERG,

Jackson, Miss., a trial subpoena is being issued for ROBERT

ADAM BENNETT, Gulfpoct, Miss., returnable

10/23/66.

This

subpoena served on BENNETT 9/2/66, by Deputy USM SAM

PETERSON.

Attorney RICHARD B. GRAVES contacted SA WILLIAM F.

DUKES at Gulfport, Miss., 8/31/66, and expressed concern

about the background and possible

ethics of Washington, D. C.,

Attorney JACK/WASSERMAN. GRAVES, who is a young, relatively

inexperienced

attorney with very little criminal practice,

volunteered that he had been in contact with wASSERMAN the

past week interviewing witnesses and preparing the defense

case. He stated he found WASSERMAN to be a highly intelli

gent and capable individual who conducted penetrative inter-

views and who is apparently very expensive.

GRAVES, who

furnished no additional specifics, inquired whether

the FBI

would furnish him any information about WASSERMAN'S background

which might resolve the question in GRAVES' mind whether he

should continue to associate with WASSERMAN in this case, as

he feels WASSERMAN is moving

in "fast company." Mr. GRAVES

was informed that the FBI could not furnish him any infor-

mation whatever in this case and that he might desire to

direct any further inquiry in this regard to USA ROBERT E.

HAUBERG, Jackson, Miss., or the U. S. Department of Justice.

IN 238-PC, Biloxi, Miss., advised on 8/31/66,

that on about the night of 8/24/66, he observed CARLOS

MARCELLO was accompanied by his lawyer JACK

NASSERMAN, as well as by JACK KRESS,

recent Federal indictments of gambling, figures on the

Mississippi Gulf Coast, including KRESS of Tulsa, Okla.

It appeared the group was concerned, but that they felt they

would

"beat". the case.

JN

238-PC advised that, so far as he knows,

MARCELLO has no business interests on the Mississippi Gulf

Coast and apparently was there on this occasion in the

interest of KRESS, who has retained

WASSERMAN, MARCELLO'S

lawyer.

On 9/1/66, conference was held in the Office of

USA LOUIS C. LA COUR, New Orleans, La. Present were USA

LA COUR, Departmental Attorney OWEN A, NEFF, SA'S WILLIAM F.

DUKES and WILLIAM DEAN JANSEN of the Jackson Division,

and SA'S REGIS L. KENNEDY and PATRICK J. COLLINS, JR., of

the New Orleans Division.

this development and will advise the Bureau regarding specific

developments.

Both USA LA COUR and. Mr. NEFF. advise that

sufficient probably cause for the arrest of JONES and search

of his business and residence in New Orleans presently

exists, and instructed that in the interest of security of

this potential arrest

and search, no further direct inquiry.

concerning MARCELLO Or JONES should be made at this time in

the Mississippi Gulf Coast area.

On 9/20/66, SA 538-C,

whose identity is known

to the Bureau, advised that he has not been able to identify

a gambler by the name of JOHN W

nor or JOHN W. RAY, and

again related he is confident that some Negro male has

ordered gambling material under a fictitious name.

He added

that it is quite common for Negro gamblers in

the

vicinity

of Central Texas to order "crooked" or "fixed" cards or dice

under an

alias.

Aka, of Temple, Texas, on

9/20/66, informed she had been unable to identify JOHN W.

KROY or JOHN UKRaY as a rambler who may have ordered gambling La

material from Jones Brothers Parlor Supplies

in New Orleans.
