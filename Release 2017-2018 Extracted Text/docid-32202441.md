MI. Sheridan. No.

Mr. Postal. Do you recall hearing of a wiretap that

occurred in Las Vegas at the end of october of 1960, in which

the hotel room of Phyllis MeGuire was bugged?

MI. Postal. Did there come a time when the Attorney

General ever mentioned to you a pending prosecution involving

Sam Giancana?

Mr. Sheridan. No.

MI. Postal. Did you ever discuss with the Attorney General

his interest in Sam Giancana?

18

We had many discussions going back to 1957 about that subject

matter.

21

Mr. Postal. Right.

Well, you worked with the Attorney General on the McClellan

the relationship of the Teamsters with the rackets, is that

correct?

Mr. Sheridan. Yeah.

MI. Postal. And one of the areas that came under scrutiny

was the Chicago area, is that correct?

Mr. Sheridan. Yeah.

MI. Postal. And in that light, the same Sam Giancana

probably became known to you.

Mr. Sheridan. Sure.

MI. Postal. And do you recall that one of the first things

the Attorney General did when he became Attorney General was

to target for the Bureau and the other investigative agencies

of the government certain figures in organized crime that he

wanted investigated vigorously?

MI. Sheridan. Well, I think what he did was to first of

all beef up the organized crime section. He certainly indicated

he wanted the organized crime section to pursue more vigorously

the whole problem of organized crime. In that process, certain

organized crime figures were, if you want to use the word,

targeted, and Sam Giancana was one of them.

Ms. Postal.

Okay.

Is it fair to say that San Giancana was fairly high on the

list?

Mr. Postal. Okay.

Do you recall in any of your discussions of organized

crime or specifically Sam Giancana, with the Attorney Ceneral,

any mention of either a wiretap case in Las Vegas or the

name Johnny Roselli and Bob "laheu in conjunction with the nare

Sam Giancana?

Mr. Sheridan. No.

MI. Postal. Do you recall having any discussions with

the Attorney General concerning the CIA involvement or connec-

tion with Sam Giancana or John Roselli?

Mr. Sheridan. No.

-

MI. Postal. What were your specific functions in the

Department of Justice?

Mr. Sheridan. I was in charge of a group of attornes

who were looking into and holding Grand Juries concerning s.:

directing investigative activities concerning labor racie:per:-:.

Mr. Postal. Specifically James iloffa?

Mr. Sheridan. There was more emphasis on ile. ilofia ar.

the Teamsters, but there were also other unions and other

union leaders involved in that. Certainly there was more

effort involved in the leanster investigation than in the

others.

Mr. Postal. Did you vort. closely with Carmine scilaro

in that regard?

ir. Sheridan. Only in the beginning. Carmine had been on

2

the McClellan Committee with us, and he became a White House

3

Consultant, and in the very beginning he also had a desk over

4

in our area and was involved in preliminarily what ve vere doing.

5

But after a few months he no longer was involved in that

6

activity.

MI. Postal. What about Courtenay Evans? Did you or:

8

closely with Courtenay Evans?

9

MI. Sheridan. Well, I certainly knew Courtenay Evans.

10

11

He was-not our direct link with the FBI.. Our direct link an

the FBI was Al MeGrath. And Al MeGrath was in charge of the

12 |

accounting, and he was the supervisor of the accounting ses::..

13

I guess they call it, at the Bureau. And I think that ass:

14

because our initial, major efforts were in the area of the

required a lot of accounting expertise, and we were usara :.:

were there people that he would deal with directly in thrashing

out a problem outside of the normal line of authority normally?

Mr. Sheridan. Yes. He would usually consult mainly with

the heads of the various divisions of the Department. That

would be Jack Miller, Lou Oberdorfer, and he was the head of

the Tax Division, and Jack Miller was the head of the Criminal

Division, and Ramsey Clark was the head of the Lands Division,

and John Douglas was in charge of the Civil Division. It is a

long time ago. Dick Katzenbach, who was

the Deputy Attorney

General, these were the people that he would discuss, you know,

all major problems with.

MI. Postal. Did you ever have occasions to meet with the

Attorney General either late in the evening or during the tai

and discuss with him matters of concern to him outside of a

particular problem that you were working on?

Mr. Sheridan. I am sure I did, I am sure I did.

Mr. Postal. Did you ever --

Mr. Sheridan. Most of our discussions were on the problem

I was working on, and we had numerous discussions on that at

all times of the day.

Mr. Postal. Okay.

Mr. Sheridan. But I am sure occasionally there were crier

matters discussed.

Mr. Postal. And were you given access to any of the

intelligence reports coming from the Bureau relative to

organized crime that you felt related to what you were working

on?

Mr. Sheridan. Yeah. If there was, if

there was a need.

In other words, the two areas often intertwined, so if we got

into an area that we were interested in, we would

share informa-

tion with them and they would share information with us.

MI. Postal. In the

course of your investigation into the

labor rackets, did you have occasion to do a good deal of

investigating concerning the mob's activities in Las Vegas?

Mr. Sheridan. Not really.

We were aware of it, but the only place that our investi-

gations and theirs came in contact, or for the most part, anyway,

were the pension fund loans by the Teamsters Pension Fund to

Las Vegas casinos, and to that extent, there was a mutual

area.

But the actual investigation of organized crime in Las

Vegas was really the organized crime section work, and we,

we didn't get into it as such.

Mr. Postal. Well, as I understand it, there were two

major areas of interest insofar as the organized crime section

was concerned about Las Vegas. One was your interest in the

25

pension fund investments, and the other was their interest

n the skimming operation that was going on by some of the mob?

Mr. Sheridan. Right.

Mr. Postal. But as I understand, they were fairly closely

Mr. Sheridan. I think that's a fair statement.

Mr. Postal. -- related?

Mr. Sheridan. Yeah.

MI. Postal. So in your activities in Las Vegas you

must have come into contact with the names again of Giancana

and Roselli

and the other group that was in Las Vegas as opposed

to

the Cleveland group with loe Dalitz and some of the other

mobsters?

Mr. Sheridan.

With Dalitz, yes, because Dalitz and his

group were in the Stardust, and the Desert Inn, and they both

had received pension fund loans.

The people like Giancand and the others, the Mafia people

like from Chicago were not involved in any of these loans, and

I

don't recall, therefore, any direct involvement on our part

with those people.

: Mr. Postal. Un-huh.

Mr. Sheridan. You see, Dalitz was up front, and it is

kind of a unique situation because what you are talking about

1S

the Cleveland group who moved from Cleveland to Las Vegas.

and in the process acquired some degree of respectability, and

they owned the casinos, and they were on record, and they were

25

out front.

The Mafia types like Giancana, who it was believed had

secret interests in these casinos, were not up front and so

our interests were on the loans, and the pension funds, and the

pension fund was dealing directly with the Dalitz people, loans

to other casinos, where the Mafia may have had direct interest.

it was not apparent and we never got into it.

Mr. Postal. Did you ever have occasion to look into

interests in Miami?

Mr. Sheridan. Sure.

Mr. Postal. Did you ever look into the Fontainbleu

Hotel?

Mr. Sheridan. No.

There again, there was no -- it was their -- but there

was no pension fund involvement, there was no -- there was :

direct interest of ours in the fontainbleu Hotel.

Mr. Postal. Okay.

How about Los Angeles? Did you ever get involved on

mob activities in Los Angeles?

Mr. Sheridan. We got involved in pension fund actavse:

in Los Angeles.

Mr. Postal. Uh-huh. In conjunction with that, did you

ever run across Johnny Roselli?

Mr. Sheridan. I knew who Johnny Roselli was, but he rever.

as far as I know, was involved in any of our investigations

some of the mob

people were, and some of them weren't, and it just depends which

ones were as to whether we were going to be interested, like

Gus Zapaz, for instance,

in Chicago was involved in, so we

were interested in him.

Mr.

Postal. Did you know a man named Letterer from Chicago?

Mr. Sheridan. Not offhand.

MI. Postal. Let me step out of this particular line for

second.

Mr. Sheridan. Okay.

MI. Postal. And ask you this: at the time of the Bay of

Pigs operation, did you have occasion to discuss with the

Attorney General any of his feelings about the Bay of pies ::

the whole Cuba situation?

MI. Sheridan. Not really. I knew, I knew it had haoreres.

I knew it was a disaster, and I knew he was very concernes. ...:

I don't recall any conversation directly about that that to sri

I ever had.

Mr. Postal. Did he ever discuss with you his escaist:?:

involvement in the intelligence community after the Bay o' '::s?

MI. Sheridan. No. Again, I knew that he, I knew that e

had taken a significant role in that, but I don't think te

ever discussed it with me.

Mr. Postal. Uh-huh.

MI. Sheridan. It was his nature that he discussed !..

with me that, I mean, so far as he was concerned what I was

doing was a full time job, and very important, and 90 percent

of our discussions were about that subject.

MI. Postal. Okay.

Were you aware, for example, of the fact that the Attorney

General was participating with General Maxwell Taylor, among

others, in a board of inquiry shortly after the Bay of pigs to

determine --

Mr. Sheridan. Yes.

MI. Postal. What had or had not happened with our

paramilitary operations?

Mr. Sheridan. Yes.

MI. Postal. Did he ever discuss any of it?

MI. Sheridan. Findings or anything?

MI. Postal. Yes, findings or information?

MI. Sheridan. No.

MI. Postal. Okay.

Do you recall ever -- well, let me ask you this way:

you recall ever hearing in April or May of 1961, this was

shortly after the Bay of Pigs, of a problem that arose wit.i

the prosecution because of the Central Intelligence Agency's

involvement?

Mr. Sheridan. No.

Mr. Postal. Prepared contemporaneously with that problem? !

Mr. Sheridan. No.

MI. Postal. But if I showed you, might refresh your

recollection?

Mr. Sheridan. No. Again, there was, there was no need

for me to, there would be no occasion for me to.

Mr. Postal. Well, I understand that. But it seems that

fair number of people at Justice who were either involved in

a particular wiretap case, or were in a position to have had

access to certain people who might have known about it, and

heard the skuttlebutt, as it were, and while they may not have

had an institutional need to know, the word was around.

MI. Sheridan. I am sure that's true. But we -- I didn't

and easily could have, but I didn't.

Mr. Postal. So you never heard any mention of the Baletti

wiretap case, or Dan Rowan, or Phyllis McGuire or any of that

business?

Mr. Sheridan. Well, that's a good question. You see, when

I was with NBC, we did another special on the Jim Garrison

investigation of the assassination, and we discredited that

investigation very strongly to the extent that Mr. Garrison

charged me with public libeling and arrested me or had me

arrested. I surrendered, and ultimately we went into feder?:

court and got the charge dismissed. So I am quite familiar

with Garrison's investigation, and as a result of that, with

the Warren Commission investigation in the New Orleans area.

I must say not to the extent that many of the buffs are, bu:

I do know that Garrison and his investigation focused on a

man named David Ferry, who is a rather strange fellow, who

~35

an Eastern Airlines Pilot, or a former Eastern Airlines p1!s:.

and he theorized that Ferry was involved somehow with a bunc:

of Cubans, and that they had conspired with a fellow named

Clay Shaw to kill John Kennedy.

Our investigation of that investigation indicated to i

25

that Mr. Garrison had not one

scintilla of evidence of an

prone (Aros 202) 514-6000

2

that. He ultimately tried Clay Shaw for the crime, and Shaw

was acquitted, as he should have been. He had nothing to do wita

it.

4

So consequently, David Ferry, if you want to start a David

5

Ferry investigation, David Ferry at the time of the assassination,

6

was working for Carlos Marcello's attorney, and Carlos Marcello

7

was on trial just prior to the assassination and I believe was

8

acquitted, I think, the day of of the day before the assassination

9

But Garrison never went into that area I think for, I think I

10

know where it leads him, but I think if Garrison was going to

11

investigate and start with David Ferry as the focal point, the

12

13

logical way to go instead of toward the Cubans, was towards

Carlos Marcello.

14

I just think overall one of the forces that had a great

15

deal to gain by the assassination of John Kennedy was the mob,

16

so I think any theory as to what might have been, or who might

17

" have been involved, if anyone was involved other than Oswald,

18

19

would have to include the mo. I have no question that Osivald

killed Kennedy. I know of no evidence that anyone else was

20

involved. And so at least at this point I have to conclude that!

21

the Warren Commission was right. I don't preclude the possibili:!

22

that there were others involved, and that the Warren Commission

23

was wrong in holding Oswald as being singly involved.

24

25

Mr. Postal. You said you had a suspicion that when you

mentioned that had Garrison

commenced with David Ferry and

proceeded instead of going towards the Cubans, rather towards

Marcello, that that particular line of inquiry would have borne

perhaps a good deal more fruit?

:Ir. Sheridan. ivo, I didn't say that. I said that if you

are going to start with ferry, it is just logical that you not

only investigate his connections with the Cubans, you also

investigate his connections with Marcello. Garrison may have

been and probably was completely erroneous in starting with

Ferry in the first place.

Mr. Postal. Okay.

Mr. Sheridan. Because I don't know of any involvement of

Ferry in the assassination. There was more involvement of

Ferry with Marcello than there was I think in any assassinatic?

plot.

He worked for Marcello.

MI. Postal. Okay.

Do you know of any specific reason why Marcello, as cuposed

to any other particular nobster, would want to involve himse!!

in this?

Mr. Sheridan. No. ilo. And I didn't think, you know.

local level. It would have to be something approved at the

highest level, it would be a total mob involvement, not just shell

involvement of one.

would have been only as an instrumentality for the national

Mr.

that it was because ofCiancana's relationship or Sinatra's

relationship with Giancana./

could have told me that. The fact that he didn't is probably

just coincidence, if they were thinking, if they had had

I never heard of this thing until I read it in

you have occasion to discuss it with anybody at that time?

column, but I don'e think so. Generally what I rememiered ::
