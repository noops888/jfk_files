PRIO through RICARDO MADAN, who, at that time, was in the

airline express business in Miami. MADAN took VAZQUEZ

to see PRIO. VAZQUEZ transported guns from Key West by

way of a plane which he flew for "Q" Airlines from Key

At

that time AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO was in charge of

the PRIO group in Cuba. The storage of the guns in

the Key West area was arranged for by one CARLOS MEDINA,

a mechanic at "Q" Airways in Key West who also helped load

the plane.

On June 30, 1958, MARIA SOLIDAD VAZQUEZ, Wife

of DANIEL VAZQUEZ, above mentioned, furnished to Agent

DAVIS a list of Cuban exiles who were in Mexico as of

1953, and one of those so listed was RICARDO MADAN.

Mxs. VAZQUEZ also furnished a list which was.

given to her by PRIO in 1953 which contained the names

of people on whom PRIO felt he could rely. The name

RICARDO MADAN appeared on this 1ist.

Again it should be noted that current

instructions are that information furnished by Mr. and

Mrs. VAZQUEZ is not to be disseminated outside the Bureau

without prior Bureau authority.

As set forth in Miami letter to the Bureau

dated February 25, 1960, MADAN has been in periodic,

regular contact with the Miami Office on a voluntary

basis, and has furnished information which, where

subject to verification, was found to be correct.

'MM 105-2150

MADAN has admitted being a member of the

Authentic Organization of ex-Cuban President CARLOS PRIO!'

SOCARRAS, and has admitted pleading nolle contendere

to the charge of illegally exporting arms without a

license in New York City in late 1954, and subsequently

paying a fine of $2,500.00. He claims that at the time

that the entering of the nolle contendere plea was

discussed with him by his attorney he did not fully

understand the entire process until it was too late to do

anything about it, so kept quiet and paid

the fine.

MADAN admits participation in the attacks on

the presidential palace in Havana, Cuba, in March, 1957,

and subsequent imprisonment in Cuba for his part in

said atacks.

MADAN said that he has never been an agent of

the CASTRO Government or the BATISTA Government, and has

not been Involved in any activity on behalf of either.

He stated that he has had no part in any activity which

could be termed political or revolutionary subsequent to

the fall of the BATISIA Government January, 1959. He

voluntarily advised that he had been approached by

agents of the Cuban Government during the Spring and"

Summer of 1959, to work for them and stated that he

emphatically refused, pointing out to them that he has

ceased all activity of a political nature and is devoting

himself to his business interests. He stated that he is

known to be anti-BATISTA, and that he has never been known

to be pro-CASTRO, that all activities he engaged in in

Cuba were on behalf of CARLOS PRIO, whom he stated at

this time is not active in any way.

MADAN is on friendly terms with CARLOS BERTOT,

the current Commercial Attache of the Cuban Consulate

in Miami, and in January, 1960, furnished for examination

a letter listing the personnel of the Cuban Consulate

in Miami with BERTOT's comments concerning same to the

Miami Office for examination. This letter was given to

MADAN by BERTOT for delivery to the then incoming new

Cuban Consul General for Miami named A, LEON BLANCO.

BLANCO, at that time, was Consul at West Palm Beach,

Florida, and BLANCO is married to MADAN's.

half sister.

MADAN has also informed of a possible fifth column

type infiltration of the Nicaraguan Government by CASTRO

agents which has been reported to the Bureau by previous

communication in a form suitable for dissemination. dU)

In view of the above and the fact that no

specific information has been disclosed by investigation

which reflects that MADAN is acting as an agent on behalf

of the Cuban Government, instant matter is being closed.

A 134 file has already been opened on MADAN,

and he is being considered for development by the Miami

Office as a PSI.

MM Tol said that on December 27, 1956, it was

reported that SANCHEZ was working with RICARDO MADAN, and

they were responsible for shipping a large quantity of

arms into Cuba by use of the Air Express Service.

MM Tol said that on April 27, 1957, a report was

received that SANCHEZ and MADAN had been sentenced to death

by certain elements of the "PRIO cause", who accused them of

not having distributed all of the ammunition for the

attack on the Presidential Palace in Havana on March 13,

1957. MM T-4 said that this report of April 27, 1957,

indicated that SANCHEZ had accused MADAN of being the

only one responsible for the failure of the attack on

the Palace.

On October 11, 1957, MM TOS, another government

agency which conducts personnel or intelligence investi-

gations, stated that RICARDO MADAN RIVAS, presently a

resident of Miami Springs, Florida (as of October 11,

1957), had amitted to the Immigration and Naturalization

Service Agents in Miami that he had been active in

revolutionary activities, but he denied that he had

MM. T-2 advised that he knows MADAN personally

and does not like him, but believes that during the period

of the mid-1950's MADAN was working for money.

MM T-2 stated that he would describe MADAN as

an exporter of arms and textiles in 1957.

MM Tº2 said that in 1957 the largest cache of

dynamite seized during that general period by the Cuban

Government was reportedly MADAN's own, at least he was

held to be responsible for its being in Cuba.

MM T-2 stated that MADAN now gets marble from

Cuba and Mexico, and that MM T-2 has heard that MADAN

has purchased machinery for making tetrazzo flooring from

Italy, and that he still owes money for such machinery.

On February 18, 1960, the files of the

Immigration and Naturalization

• Service reflect that

MADAN's number is A10-178-023.

Their records reflect

that his passport number was 03987, issued by the Republic

of Cuba on March 12, 1953, and that it had an expiration

date of March 11, 1958. His date and place of birth were

listed as Havana, Cuba, December 25, 1912, and his address,

at that time, was 4th Avenue between 48th am 50th Streets,

Miramar, Havana, and his United States address was 1225

Southwest 2ind Terrace. His places of residence were

listed as from birth to 1953, Havana, Cuba, and from

1953 to 1955, the time of the filing of the application

for temporary stay in the United States, as in Miami most

of the time.

Reports from the Ministry of Justice of the

Republic of Cuba and from the municipal jail in Havana,

both dated December 29, 1954, reflect that there was

no record which would reflect on the character or the

morality of MADAN as of those dates. A check of the Miami

Police Department record of January 11, 1955, showed no

record of MADAN, according to information contained

in the above mentioned Inmigration and Naturalization

Service file.

MADAN listed a brother, RAFAEL MADAN RIVAS, and

a friend, ESPERANZA VYRÓMERO, address In 1954 6648

Southwest o5th Street,

Mzam1.

In 1954, in his

FLORIDA

application to e

extend his stay in the United States,

which was dated December 20, 1954, he stated that he had

entered the United States by Air France Airlines on

October 23, 1954, as a visitor. He claimed to be a

political exile and stated that to return to Cuba would

mean his execution.

He submitted a copy of an indictment

in case number C-144-174 which reflected that in the

United States District Court for the Southern District

of New York in the case entitled, "United States of

America versus CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, ET AL", in which

the name RICARDO MADAN was also listed, that the

defendants were charged with the statement that on or

about March 10, 1952, and continuously thereafter,

they did combine, conspire, etc., to commit offenses

against the United States, to-wit:

violations of

Title 22, United States Code, Section 452(D) and

452(1) Proclamation 2776 dated March 26, 1948, and Proclamation

3038 dated November 18, 1953, and as part of the conspiracy

they purchased and caused to be purchased rifles, shells,

vessels, etc., and that, too, they did export and attempt

to export from the United States to another state, to-wit:

Cuba, the above mentioned items without a license and without

an advice to the Secretary of State.

The indictment

also charged them with the violation of the Conspiracy

Statute, Title 18, Section 371, United States Code.

Filed with a copy of the above indictment was

a petition to reconsider the application of MADAN for

temporary stay in the United States, which listed his

attorney as: W. EMORY DAUGHERTY, JR

asks that the application for extention to extend
