Middleton Mandatory Review Request (E92-0185)

1. This Lyndon Johnson Library request consists of

twenty-two documents from

a Johnson Library file identified as

"NSF, Intelligence File, 'Oswald, Lee Harvey,' Box 9."

requester, Mr. Harry J. Middleton, is Director of the Johnson

Library.

The same material is also being piggybacked to

another requester, Mr. August Russo, in our case E92-0199.

We have made a preliminary assessment of these

documents with regard to the fact that similar documents

relating to the JFK assassination are being reviewed by the

newly restructured Historical Review Group which is under a

mandate by the DCI to assume a bias toward declassification.

We note the following intelligence concerns which are

evident in the Oswald material now presented

for review:

Intelligence derived from foreign liaison: Found in

Document Nos. 6, 8, 9, 20, 25, 28, and 32a.

Intelligence derived from covert sources: Found in

Document Nos. 11, 13, 30, and 33a.

Intelligence derived from signals intercept (or wire tap)

programs: Found in Document Nos. 21a, 23, 24, 29, and 31.
