TP T-3, advised SA JAMES P. O'NEIL on October

4, and 6, 1961, that SAM MONDELLO, JR., had bragged of bringing

cash back out of Cuba for SANTO TRAFFICANTE at the time the

power.

three years with a prostitute and he was apparently still

residing with this prostitute in Miami.

Source further

noted that he did not know the reason for MONDELLO's being

in Miami or what MONDELLO was doing, but he did describe

MONDELLO as being a strong-arm man rather than having the

finesse to direct any phase of an operation.

tion

for TRAFFICANTE outside the United States and he

understands that this operation is in Aruba, Netherlands.

and BENNY FERNANDEZ are sharing the responsibility, apparently

with the two alternating for a period of time, with the other

man returning to report and probably bringing

proceeds.

talking, and if he were

operating in Aruba, RUBIO may be approached.

He noted RUBIO

and

FERNANDEZ are receiving $1500.00 a month plus expenses
