The Honorable Alan Cranston

United

States Senator

11000 Wilshire Boulevard

Los Angeles, California

Dear Senator,

As a registered Democrat that has supported you in the

past, I find that I must now call on you for help.

-writing to you on behalf of my husband, Loran E. Hall, who

has been having difficulty with several Federal governmental

272925

agencies.

First, he recently applied for his DD-214, GI Eligibility

for

a home loan, through a local mortgage company.

He was

subsequently informed

that there had been a fire in the Recards

Center in St. Louis and that there was no record of his

military service.

Now what?

Secondly, he sent a request to the FAA Headquarters in

Oklahoma City for a duplicate

copy of his pilot's licanse

and was told that they can find no record of

that.

I really

find that hard to believe.

If you will have your office contact us, I will be happy..

to supply you with all the necessary details.

Any assistance

that you san provide will be sincerely appreciated:

Thanking you in advance for your consideration and prompt

attention to this matter.

Very truly yours,

Dhrong Reply
