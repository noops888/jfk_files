dealing with VALENTI but tried to hold up VALENTI for more

had furnished the guns which had been used. He advised that he

broke off his connections with VALENTI, LA ROCCA and others

in about 1953. He said he has since furnished information to

associates and that this individual also hanaled a

PO 92-228; PO 92-236 I TOTAL DENIAL:

MECHLING advised that the information furnished by MC DOWELL

held no particular significance for him until, the evening

of July 31, 1958, while in the process of conducting a

survelliance of GABRIEL MANNARINO's home on Charles Avenue,

he observed a red and white 1956 Plymouth station wagon

bearing Pennsylvania license 953GY pull up in fronts

of the MANNARINO home and observed the occupants entering

the house.

PennsyLvania Motor Vehicle Bureau records Indicate Pennsylvania

License 950 GY 1s registered to Anna Marie Domenick, 1014

It is noted that the Manor

Road address le approximately two blocks from the MANNARINO

home on Charles Avenue in New Kensington,

WILLIE SuMs Do september 18, 195ge that while talkans with

SAMS

was complaining

about a terrible hangover and mentioned that he got drunk

with GABRIEL MANNARINO during the evening of September 15

or the morning of September 16, 1958.

T-9 said that SAMS

also told him that MANNARINO has been back in New Kensington

since early september and is very unhappy about the lack of

business in

the gambling casino and the general pressure being

brought to bear on New Kensington by Federal investigative

agencles®

T-9 said that SAMS aid not go into any further

detall regarding his drinking bout with MANNARINO and T-9

considered it inadvisable to press him at the risk of

appearing to be too inquisitive.

T-9 pointed out that in

all probability, SAMS and MANNARINO did their arinking on

September 15 or 16, 1950, at the Laetus

Club on Fifth Avenue,

New Kensington, next door to the Triangle Billlards gambling

casino.1-9 noted that SAMS follows a strict daily routine

MANNARINO sport betting operation usually until one or two

in the morning every day except Sunday and he seriously doubted

whether MANNARINO would risk drinking at any other establishment

providing, of course, they did not go to one of their homes.

T-9 assumed that MANNARINe probably entered the Laetus Club

through the rear door on Bames Street. and spent the evening

with SAMS drinking in the Laetus Club since the management

that club would not betrey MANNARINe nor would the local

police.

T-9, on September 19, 1958, said that JINVY BUFFONE, Westmoreland

County Detective and

constable of the First Ward, New Kensington;
