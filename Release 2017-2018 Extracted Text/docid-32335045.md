Enclosed for the Bureau are nine copies of LHM

suitable for dissemination concerning the current status

of the FPCC.

To date, no information has been developed

indicating that the FPCC has taken any

positive legal steps

to disband. However, it is to be noted that the FPCC

is merely a committee of the Institute for the Improvement

ot Inter-American Relations, Incorporated, and that it is possible

that the FPCC could declare or consider itself disbanded without

taking any actual legal action, relying on the parent organization

to handle the necessary legal matters.
