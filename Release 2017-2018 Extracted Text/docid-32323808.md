involved in any illegal activity or is identified as a

known member of LCN, this matter will be immediately

reopened for investigation and the Bureau kept advised

of all pertinent developments.

For the information of the Bureau, JAMES VAUGHN,

Area Security Supervisor, Southwestern Bell

Telephone Company,

Dallas, Texas, had previously advised the Dallas Office that

due to pending litigation involving the telephone company in

Las Vegas, Nevada, telephone company officials had issued a

directive

that in the future no information concerning toll

calls would be furnished to any law enforcement agency without

the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum or an appropriate

court order.

On 1/4/66, Mr. VAUGHN, a former Bureau Agent,

confidentially advised, however, that he would check to

ascertain if there had been any pertinent long distance

tele-

phone calls made from telephones at the subject's residence

and/or his business.

On 1/17/66, Mr. VAUGHN stated that he had reviewed

the toll calls charged to these four telephones (restaurant -

TA 7-0355 and TA 7-7711; residence - TA 7-7501 and TA 1-0863),

and had noted that there was no pattern to any long distance

telephone calls, that all long distance calls had been made

to apparent relatives, and that there appeared to be no

pertinent information

to be obtained from a review of these

toll calls.
