By coincidence, NEWBILL has recently been sentenced

for assault with a deadly weapon by the District Attorney's

Office, which had been scaled down from a felony to a misde-

meanor. NEWBILL, according to the District Attorney's Office,

1s not desirous of going to jail. He will be sentenced on

1960 and it is felt by the District Attorney's Office

that he should prove cooperative in their contacts with him.

There has been no additional information regarding this since

the initial contact was reported above.

ANGELINE? DELANEY

11717 Montana

Cai!

Apartment 20

Occupation: Waitress

Los Angeles T-32 advised that ANGIE (LNU) was extremely

friendly with COHEN and COHEN often came to ANGIE's apartment

which is located immediately adjacent to his own, for early morn-

ing rides in COHEN's car to places such as Ventura, etc.

The records of the California Bank, Brentwood, reflect

that Mrs. ANGELINE DELANEY, 11717 Montana Avenue, Apartment 20,

occupation waitress at Tractons, has opened an account at the

bank on August 11, 1959. A review of checks issued on this account

conducted on October 21, 1959 by SA WILLIAM JOHN NOLAN reflected

numerous debit memos for returned checks issued by DELANEY.

personal observation on November 21, 1959 indicated that DELANEY

necupies a rear apartment at the Montana Street address, which

spartment is approximately 150 feet from COHEN's apartment across

a back yard.

The records of the call board reflect that ANGELINE

DELANEY telephonically contacted COHEN on September 24, 1959.
