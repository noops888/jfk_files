CIA's response to

On January

9, 1976, the staff asked for access to the Amlash file at CIA; and

after a

delay which was not explained, the staff was permitted to

reiniew the file on January 23 and 26.

Summary of Amlash File

Amlash initially contacted by CIA in 1961 met occasionally with

case officers through August 1962, at which time he was given instruc-

tion in secret writing and explosives.

Interest in Amlash continued

after the August meetings, but there was no further direct contact by CIA

agents until mid-1963. Why there was a year lapse in contact with Am-

lash cannot be determined; the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962

undoubtedly made

CIA cautious in dealing with Amlash.

In any event, DIR 48198**

Amwhip,

of 19 June 1963 states that

had sent a letter as part of

an "activation ettort to reluctant dragon." Presumably, Amlash was

"reluctant dragon" and was, by this letter, asked to recontact CIA.

officials and athletes to

meetings which they viewed essentially as a get acquainted session.

to DIR öf 7

September stated that Amlash told Amwhip he felt there were only two

ways of getting rid of Castro.

The first was an invasion by U.S.

forces which Amlash knew was out of the question and the second was

an

"inside job."

Amlash indicated he was awaiting a U.S. plan of action.

He referred to

the

explosives demonstration CIA gave him a year earlier

as "too cumbersome" for his purposes.

On October 15,

to DIR states case officer O met with

Amlash and Anwhip

on 13 October.

Although the case officer had been

forewarned by Anwhip, he was not successful in discouraging Amlash's

request for a high level meeting.

"Amlash convinced that if such meet

does not take place at this time

it will be almost impossible come out

again and we will be in same situation as last year with no definite

decision.

Also finds it difficult

to believe why RFK who receives many

Cubans would refuse to see a major" such as Amlash. The message notes

the fact remains that Amlash does "have excellent entree to highest

target level which believe we cannot afford overlook.

This message seemingly moved Headquarters to re-evaluate Amlash's

role. DIR 75683

on 15 October directed case officer 0 to

return headquarters soonest for discussions of all phases of the case.

The next meeting apparently took place on October 29. One case

officer met Amlash holding himself out as the personal representative

of RFK.

He informed Amlash, according to a 13 November MFR, that

the U.S. was prepared to render all necessary assistance to

any anti-

communist Cuban group which

succeeded in neutralizing the present Cuban

leadership and which

assumed significant control to invite the U.S.

to render assistance.

Amlash responded by saying that without Fidel,

he military would break up into 4 or s groups and the regime woul

He also said he was satisfied with the policy discussion

but desired to know what technical support he could get.

Since Arwhip was closer to Amlash than the case officers, he was

asked about Amlash's reaction to the

meeting.

His reactions are

The

meno ended by stating that "C/SAS* requested written reports on Amlash

operation be kept to a minimum."

to DIR of 20 November indicated Amlash had been called

on the night of November 20 and had agreed to postpone his return to

Cuba in order to see case officer O "if it something interesting."

CIA officer said he could not assure it was interesting but that it was

to be a meeting which Amlash had requested.

(Obviously, CIA wanted to

give Amlash the "technical support"

he felt he had not been promised in

the 29 October meeting.)

Case officer O flew from the U.S. so as to arrive in

on the morn-

ing of November 22 for this meeting.

is the only message in Amlash's file reflecting the fact the meeting

had taken place.

It indicated that Amlash was anxious to return

Cuba and that case officer O was to arrive in Washington at 1810 that

day.

any other time telling

to break contact with Amlash. **

to question the authenticity of this document which is three pages

also promised arms which will have to be furnished through

JMWAVE's operations.

A series of confusing cables passed between Headquarters and JWAVE

on December 6, 1, and 8.

Apparently, Headquarters first gave JMWAVE

authority to drop a cache of arms in

Cuba.. Then Headquarters called

off the operation.

In DIR 87615 of 7 December, it is noted "major

top level Cuban/Caribbean policy review scheduled early next week which

should provide basis for decision."

JMWAVE complained about the

change in orders in a cable of 8

December. JMWAVE 8702 pointed out that one Headquarter's message

indicated December infiltration operations were approved by higher author-

ity but a second message indicated a scheduled operation should be de-

layed and not run in December.

Headquarters responded in DIR 87880. Headquarters procedure

was

to present infiltration operation plans to "higher authority"

even though there is a reasonable chance operation may

be postponed

or delayed as was case with the scheduled operation.

"This procedure

will secure approval for the operation with only telephonic reconfirma

cion needed when previously relaxed operation finally mounted."

Head-

quarters recommended delay until January after considering and equating

objectives against risk factors for Amlash and others.

The same document states this message was communicated to Amlash

in November 1964 by

Despite this decision, the CIA in fact continued to assist Amlash

through a cut-out until Amlash's arrest in 1966.

Later documents on Amlash are also relevant to the September-

November 1963 Amlash operation.

Several

such documents report informa-

tion received to the effect that Fidel Castro had long been aware of

Amlash's plots against him.

For example, Amlash's one time Cuban

mistress was believed to be working

for Cuban intelligence and her

brother was

known to be with Cuban

intelligence?

to DIR

in December 1964 warns that Amlash's objective may be known to too

many Cubans. And, one CIA informant reported in 1966 on one known

double agent of Cuban intelligence working

• for CIA and said the CIA's

Cuban operations had been penetrated at a high level by Cuban intel-

ligence. He identified this latter individual only as one of the Cuban

exiles who was knowledgeable of a number of the most important opera-.

de talled analysis of Amlash's file contains nothing to tidicate ast

these possible penetrations of the CIA's Amlash

operation,.

although a cryptic handwritten note on at least one re-

port rejects the suggestion that Amlash was himself reporting to Castro.

One other document bears on the testimony Amlash's case officers

gave before the Select Committee to the effect that Amlash was given

a poison pen for self-protection.

That document reports that Amlash,

and other Cuban officials in Paris in 1963, were carrying pistols for

self-protection throughout their travel in Europe.

Finally, although the staff has not reviewed all possible CIA

files to determine what other operations

Castro might have been

file indicates

that some coastal landings of supplies in August were the only other

CIA operations conducted

against Cuba in this time period.
