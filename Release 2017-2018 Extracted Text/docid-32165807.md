SUBJECT:

THOMAS NABRIED

IS - C

on 3/13/64 PH 216-S advised that THOMAS NABRIED and

FRANCES GABOW attended a meeting of the Philadelphia Friends of

MARK LANE, attorney for the

mother of LEE HARVEY OSWALD, accused assassin of President Kennedy,

was the main speaker.

He commented on the five-page brief which

he filed on behalf of OSWALD.

His main point was that there is

some doubt as to OSWALD's guilt. LANE also said that a suitable

defense could be fashioned for him.

NABRIED, according to the Informant, mentioned that

he noticed many old time Party members and Party sympathizers

at this meeting. He said these people seem to be associated

with the Philadelphia Friends of

the National Guardian. NABRIED

also noticed STERLING ROCHESTER, CHARLES ROBINSON, AL and BEA

KATZ, DAVE and SOFIE DAVIS and others too numerous to recall.
