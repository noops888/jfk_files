into the shocking details of how agents of

•KGB, the Soviet secret police, are trained

to do away with Western leaders, includ-

ing officials in the U.S., and to make their

deaths appear due to natural causes.

One oi the KGB's nowly devised

sassination weapons is

"a pneumatically

cause of death."

While this deadly weapon has yet to be

used against any high

Western official,

hundreds of KGB agents covertly operat-

ing outside of Russia have been supplied

with this pocket-size gun,

awaiting only

orders from Moscow to use it.

HIGHLIGHTS OF the suppressed intel-

ligence estimate, which is locked in a se-

curity area within the tightly guarded CIA,

are as follows:

"It has been reported that the KGB on-

deavors to remove the threat to Soviet in-

terests posed by certain members of West-

governments,

sometimes arranging

for the dismissal of such persons from

public office, at other times even having

them 'eliminated' physically.

While McCone furnished the commis-

reports on Lee Harvey Oswald's eight days

Mexico City before the assassination,

including details of Oswald's contact with

the head KGB agent in the Soviet embas-

there, the CIA chief gave no hint of

the Kremlin's assassination policy.

The investigators also are trying to de

Oswald's trip to Mexico City gave details

only of the defector's visit to the Russian

embassy and not the Cuban embassy. The

CIA did not report the latter visit until

after Kennedy's assassination in Dales.
