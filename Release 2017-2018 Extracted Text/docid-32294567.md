Ricardo contacted Legat approximately four times

after initial visitland on two occasions furnished Legat

data on members of Cuban Embassy which were obviously

obtained from DISIP files]e(s)

On 9/30/76, Ricardo appeared unannounced at American

Embassy and requested assistance in obtaining a visa to U.S.

since he had a photographic assignment for "Vision" Magazine

in Jamaica and planned a two-day stopover in Puerto Rico.

Ricardo stated that he intended to leave on 10/1/76 and

since a travel agency told him the visa process would take

three days, requested Legat's assistance. U

*Review of Ricardo's passport reflected that Ricardo

had traveled from Caracas to Port-of-Spain, Trinigad, on

8/29/76, and had returned to Caracas on 9/1/76&> Legat

recalled that the bombing of the Guyanese Consulate in

Port-of-Spain had occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m.,

on 9/1/76, and wondered in view of Ricardo's association

with louis Posada, if his presence there during that period

was coincidence.

(CORU publicly claimed credit for this

attack.) Legat informed Chief, Nonimmigrant Visa Section

(NIVS), he wished no special consideration for Ricardo, and

requested the issuance of a visa to him be considered on its

own merits. (

On 10/1/76, at the request of Ricardo, Legat communicated

with Vice Consul who wished to know if Legat

• believed Ricardo

would return to Venezuela after his visit in the U.S., or if

he was likely to remain there illegally.. Legat informed the

Vice Consul he had no reason to believe Ricardo would not

return to Caracas. 4

In a conversation with an official of DISIP on 10/1/76,

Legat broached the subject of Ricardo and of the faint suspicion

that Ricardo may have been somehow involved in the bombing of

the Guyanese

Consulate in Port-of-Spain. The DISIP official

related DISIP hadono reason to believe Ricardo was the caliber

of individual that would be utilized in such an operation and

thai Ricardo was not known to be involved

in spite of his association with Posada.

Department of State (DOS) Reaction

Since the escalation of CORU terrorist activities,

DOS has sought the deportation of Bosch first from Nicaragua,

and now, because of this incident, from Venezuela.

Bosch is

a Federal fugitive from the U.S., wanted for parole violation.

He was originally sentenced to a ten-year prison term in 1968

on charges relating to conspiracy, extortion and bombings.

On

12/19/72, Bosch was paroled after

serving four years.

Following

an interview with a news reporter in which he publicly admitted

sending letter bombs to Cuban Embassies, the U.S. Parole Board

issued a warrant for his arrest. Bosch

thereafter went

"El Condor" Organization Claims Credit

On 10/6/76, the "Miami Herald" received a telephone

organization was responsible for placing the bomb.

« nor overage

This

There is no known "El Condor" organization in the Miami,

Florida, area, and the only previous use of the name "El Condor"!

to claim credit for terrorist activities was by anti-Castro

Cuban terrorist, Rolando Otero in "Military Communiques," he

issued after several bombings in Miami in December, 1975.

Otero is in jail in Miami awaiting trial on these charges. U

This claim is believed to be without substance;

however, it has caused Caribbean countries to speculate freely

that anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami were responsible for

the crash of the airliner.
