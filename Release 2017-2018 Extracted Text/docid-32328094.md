On February 4, 1958, PCI GOFFREDO CELLINI, whose

identity must be kept confidential and who is employed at the

gambling casino at the Hotel Nacional, advised that a group

of individuals composed mostly of Italians had checked into

the Nacional and that he was suspicious that they might be

either connected with gambling operations in the New York -

New Jersey area or hoodlums in that area since two of the

individuals, PETER FOLLINI and ALBERT NAFT, claimed to have

known CELLINI several years ago when CELLINI was engaged in
