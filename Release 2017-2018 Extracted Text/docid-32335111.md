FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned "What

Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play for Cuba

Committee (FPCC).

This advertisement announced the formation

of the FPCC in New York City and declared the FPCC intended to

promulgate "the truth about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize

the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961, Dr.

Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert Taber

as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and Taber

obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied

toward the cost of the afore- nentioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during

the first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby influence

FPCC policy. However, during the past year this source observed

there has been a successful effort by FPCC leadership to minimize

the role of these and other organizations in the FPCC so that today

their influence is negligible. u

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that the

National Headquarters of the FPCC is located in Room 329 at 799

Broadway, New York City. According to this source

the position

of National Office Director was created in the Fall of 1962 and

was filled by Vincent "Ted" Lee

who now formulates FPCC policy.

This source observed lee has followed a course of entertaining

and accepting the cooperation of many other organizations

including the CP and the SWP when he has felt it would be to

policy to be determined by any other organization.

Lee feels the

SPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic relations betweel

Cuba and the United States and support the right of Cubans to

manage their revolution without interference from other nations,

but not support the Cuban revolution per se.u
