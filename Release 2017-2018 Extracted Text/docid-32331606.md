Records of the Maryland State Police and St. Marys County

Sheriff's Office pertaining to their activities prios

to, during, and subsequent to the arrests made on

6-13-63 should be obtained.

Such material as

affidavits, reports of interviews of persons

arrested, records of surveillances, and any other

data of relativity is desired.

Since Tourine is know to reside in such places as

Mami, New York City, and Washington, D. Co, it woule

be important in developing the interstate travel

element to show that Towrine resided in other than

the State of Maryland just prior to his arrival in

Lexington

Park, Maryland, or to his arrest on

6-13-03.

In this regard, any record of such

residence should be secured.. It is noted that

WFO 1108-C advised on 6.7-63 that a dice game

located at 1915 Biltnore Street, Washington, D. C.,

was operated by Charles Tourine and others.

that Tourine may have resided in

the Distriet of Columbia just prior to going to

Lexington Park, Maryland.

Information received from WTO 1108-0 on 6-7-63

reveals

that a mahogany dice table used in Nesline's

Amber Club of Washington, D. C., was mored to a

shack in the rear of the

Sportsman's Restaurant,

St. Marys County, Maryland on 6-6-63. It would

appear pertinent

to determine who requested this

table noved, who moved the table,

how it was moved,

and whether

there is any record of the transaction.

It should be determined whether checks were accepted

from participants who gambled at the pertinent club.

In the event such was the case, establish who accepted

same and where such checks may

have boen deposited or

cashed and by whom,

In the event Nesline or Tourine

maintain a

bank account in an area other than Maryland,

determine whether there was

any unusual activity or

Irregularities in connection

therewith.

In this

regard, in the

event either subject accepted an out

of-state check in connection with the gambling
