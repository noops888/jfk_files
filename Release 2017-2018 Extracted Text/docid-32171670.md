FNU O'PRY

The rally was opened with a prayer by O'PRY. There

were three speakers and three crosses were burnd..

The first to speak was O'PRY and be said the klan

needed everyone

, to help with the fight to keep Negroes

from mixing with the white children and mixing of all kinds.

He told of chasing a Negro from a store near his home until

he (O'PRY) was through buying his groceries. He challenged

any preacher to face him and tell him it is God's will to

integrate. O'PRY introduced FNU NOUCE as the next speaker.

NOUCE has spoken at several klan rallies and he said

he understands the way the Southern people feel about mixing.

* ay ten

There was not much said about the death of JACK

KENNEDY, but it was said the klan was not to run him down,

but his stands on integration would be talked about.

JASON KERSEY told the group the United Florida Ku

Klux Klan is a part of the real klans and is not an outlaw
