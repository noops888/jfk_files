SE 711-S advised that this matter was discussed

at an Executive Committee meeting of the King County

mụch discussion as to the significance and origin of

the letter and it was finally decided the letter was

probably the work of some splinter group.

attending this meeting observed in a somewhat guilty

manner that their approach to the new youth organization

might be considered revisionist.

One member thought

he might have received the letter because he has been an

outspoken critic of the new youth organization. It

was decided this matter would be taken up with the

Youth Commission of the Northwest District of the

Communist Party.

By letter dated 6/26/64, Seattle advised

that KAY NORTON, an acting County CP Youth Commission

Chairman continued to express concern over receipt

by her and several other CP youth of the ACTMLCP letter.

NORTON believes the letter came from Progressive Labor

and that her name was furnished to Progressive Labor by a

former CP youth member who has left Seattle.

Other members of the CP youth clubs in seattle

share NORTON's observations and a

great deal of discussion

has been had over the contents of the letter.

WILLIAM ALBERTSON

The expulsion of WILLIAM ALBERSON has presented

the CP with a complex series of problems.

There was

a great deal of concern over the amount and quality

of the information he presumably furnished to the FBI,

and they discussed

the steps they must take to minimize the

damage.

The leaders are concerned over the effect this will

have on the membership and some members apparently have

doubts that the Party chose the best course of action in

this matter.

It is difficult to overestimate the

damage that has been caused u

connection with ALBERTSON'S

expulsion. Consideration was given to having this

doubt or suspicion on other CP members as regards the

in predicting how this would work out no recommendations

have been submitted to the Bureau.

NY 388-S had been an informant designated to

participate in the counterintelligence program.

NY 388-S's
