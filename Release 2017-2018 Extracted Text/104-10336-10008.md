Re:

Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)' and we request

that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for

information and records. Please. let me krow if your understanding of any of the

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03

HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude

Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE

Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 "A" Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

CIA-IR-09 George Bush Computer Search.

The Review Board provided CIA with a copy of an FBI document, dated

November 29, 1963, prepared under the name of John Edgar Hoover, which

states: "The substance of the foregoing information [on the assassination of

President Kennedy] was orally furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central

Intelligence Agency..." We have been informed that the DO has no record of a

"George Bush" being in the employ of CIA in 1963 with the exception of

Mr. George William Bush who has already given a sworn affidavit that he is not

the "George Bush" in question. It is our understanding that the CIA has

confirmed that the search query included George Herbert Walker Bush prior to

1970. CLA should determine whether George Herbert Walker Bush is the person

to whom the memorandum refers and should provide a definitive statement

regarding the scope of its search and the basis of its conclusion. Any and all

personnel files of George Herbert Walker Bush should be reviewed to determine

whether he had any affiliation with CLA during the 1963 period. Once the formal

statement is provided, this request will be complete.

CLA-IR-10 IG Reports.

CIA will determine whether the IG's office maintains an index or inventory of its

reports and determine whether the IG's office prepared a report on the handling

of Oswald. Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and no time frame for a

response.

CIA-IR-11 Warren Commission Critics.

We are asking that CIA determine whether it possesses any files or records on

Warren Commission critics Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, •

Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher. The Review Board is not requesting

information per se regarding any FOLA requests by these individuals or any

Public Affairs news clippings' Since April 1997, CIA has had no response and

no time frame for a response.

To the extent that CIA possesses FOIA files or records on any of these

individuals, and to the extent that those records contain information that was not filed

with the courts, such records are being requested for review by the Review Board.

Barry,

Dan called this morning to indicate that he hao

retrieved the folder on George W. Bush, the individual who

had been a GS-05 Watch Officer in 1963.

The only other

Information in the file was that George W. Bush resigned

from the Agency 15 February 1964 and went to work for dIA.

Dan added that he still had been unable to locate the file

on George H. Bush referred to in his 14

March call.

I told Dan that unless he heard from me in the next couple

of hours, he should consider this a closed query.

SUBJECT: OP NAME TRACE - George Bush

On 14 March 1997, Joe Murphy asked me to conduct an

Office of Personnel name trace on George Bush.

Joe advised

that other searches with DO, etc., were also being

conducted. This George Bush was not the former DeT or

former President, but a person supposedly associated with

the Agency in the 60's who may have been given information

about the Kennedy assassination.

I learned from voice mail that the OP Information

Officer,

I S57636, was on leave and would not

return to the office until Monday, 17 March. I then

contacted the OP/FOIA Officer,

$57639.

I questioned the direct call, indicating these

requests usually come through Becky

• Rant. I explained

nature of my request and told him I would follow up with a

call to Becky Rant's office advising them of my call.

This

was done by a call toL

on 14 March who said she

would advise Becky of the name trace request.
