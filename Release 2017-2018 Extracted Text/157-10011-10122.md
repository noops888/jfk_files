Summary of Termination

#343 589

#127 958

1. During

the course of the reorganization of the

Office of Security, it was decided that the Security

Research Staff would be abolished.

This decision led to

the preparation of a memorandum for the Director of Security

from the Chief

Request for Director oe security Assessment Regarding

dated 1 June 1973, captioned,

Continuance of Functions and Possible Replacement."

The

last paragraph of this memorandum stated:

"For immediate planning purposes, to fulfill

the early

deadline already established, it would

be appreciated

if you would review the

attached

cutiines of existing functions and indicate your

desires regarding the function (continue, continue

with low priority, discontinue) and where you wish

any retained functions to be placed in the reorgani-

zation structure.

In the latter instance, I have

attempted to indicate the more likely options for

this to facilitate your assessment."

On 4 June 1973, the Director of Security indicated

that "Special

Access Source," Charles Wiley, should continue

on a low priority and be transferred to the

Operational

Support Branch.

11. On 9 April 1974, Wiley met|

and turned

over the last statement of the cover fund accounting. Wiley's

claim amounted to $7,475.01.

12.

The Office of Security, recognizing that this claim

could not be paid as structured, contacted the Office of

Personnel to determine whether or not Wiley could be paid a

termination settlement and, if so, in what amount. Although

HR 20-32 does not apply to

independent contractors, the Office

of Personnel concluded that, under existing Agency regulation

and using HR 20-32 as a guide, Wiley could be paid a maximum

termination of $9,500. The recommendation was then made to

the DD/M&S to approve payment to Wiley in the amount of $8,000,

an amount somewhat in excess of his so-called

deficit.

13.

On 24 June 1974, Messrs.

contacted Wiley in New York City and attempted to effect a

termination settlement. Mr. Wiley promptly rejected

the $8,000

and

told Wiley they would be back in touch with him in a

couple of weeks.

14. Mr. Kane, the Director of Security, in attempt to

resolve this matter, called upon the assistance of the office

of Finance to conduct an objective study into Wiley's claim.

The Office of finance, after a complete audit, and?

upon a complete examination of all papers in the file, concluded

that Wiley could be reimbursed for direct cover expenses and

foreign travel up

to a total amount of some $20,054.23. The

Office of Finance's conclusions were formulated

into memoranda

for the DD/M&S

and the Director of Central Intelligence in carly

to pay Wiley $24,429.23,

which payment consisted of $20,054.23 in reimbursable expenses;
