On November 24 and 25, 1963, an individual who

requested his identity not be divulged but who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that on November

23, 1963, he had met in New York City with BOHDAN LEWANDOWSKI,

Polish Ambassador to the United Nations (UN), and MANFRED

LACHS, Special Advisor for Disarmament Matters to the Polish

Foreign Minister.

LACHS and LEWANDOWSKI opened a discussion

on the assassination of President KENNEDY, and questioned

the source concerning the reaction of people in the United

States.

The source advised the Poles that there was real

shock and

dismay within intellectual circles concerning the

tragedy

LACHS and LEWANDOWSKI then commented that the

assassination was a disaster and as its result, the

future was very uncertain.

LEWANDOWSKI commented that

his first reaction to the

assassination was the possibility

of a military coup d'etat in the United states; however,

LACHS had convinced him that such a reaction was unfounded

and based on a lack of knowledge of the American political

system.

Esty

LACHS and LEWANDOWSKI then discussed the

inefficiency of the Dallas Police Department, and commented

that the Chief of Police in Dallas had impressed them on

his television interviews as being "an incompetent idiot."

LACHS commented that the arrest of LEE OSWALD and his identifica

tion as a communist was probably a whitewash by the inefficient

Police Department to dig up a scapegoat for the incident, and

LACHS compared the arrest of OSWALD to the SACCO and VANZETTI

incident.

LACHS commented that no disciplined commnist could

have committed the assassination, since it was contrary to

the tate Sease a pool 2a pretent neat sat 1614)

LACHS and LEWANDOWSKI appeared very shocked by

the incident and commented that as a result of the
