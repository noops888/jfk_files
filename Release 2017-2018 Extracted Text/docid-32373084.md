MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJBCT: The Warren Commission Report and the Assascination

by Mark Lane

1. This memorandum te for information only, to call attention to the

printed text of a lecture entitled The Warren Commission Report and the

Assassination by Mark Lane, It le noted as an "Extemporaneous Lecture"

delivered at University College, London, 10 December 1964. It is published

by the British /who killed Kennedy?' Committee.

2, The author, Mark Lane, Is a New York attorney, whose role in the

Oswald case needs no further elaboration here.

3. In discussing the composition of the Warten Commission, Lane states,

In regard to the questioning of a witness to Oswald's shooting of Officer

Tippit:

"The man who was most interested in that was Allen Dulles

one of the Directors of the ClA, a member of the Warren Com-

mission. Of course he was fired from that position in the CLA

by John F. Kennedy. The seven distinguished members of the

Warren Commission were made up of five Republicans and two

Southern Democrats.

The whole seven-man Commisston did

not have a single Kennedy supporter on ít.* (p. 8)

This same general charge was repeated by Lane in the question and answer

period following the lecture.

Stiles

L. This memorandar in for information only to bring to your

attention a forthcoming book concerning Lee Hazvey Oswald by

Congressman Gerald R. Ford with John R. Stiles, entitled Portralt of

the Assasolo (New Yorks Simon and Schuster, 1965).

2 Ms. Stiles ja a long time political associate of Congressman

Tord and was his special assistant throughout the Congreesman's tenure

do a member of the Warrea Commission established to report on the

assassination of President Kensedy. This book is weltten not so much

to tell the story of the aazassination of the President so to present a

study of Oswald as a person and to describe his tripo and activities

insolar as they aze knows. The book is comprised in very large measure

of extended extracts from the published records of the Commiasion. The

testimony and viewa of Oswald's mother, wife and brother, as well an

others who knew him, are set forth in some detail. Some empbeats jo

laid on Oswald's stormy relations with his wife and his fozceful resetions

to difficali periode in that relationship.

3.

Congreseman Ford tells of some of the problems the Com-

mission faced in developing the evidence in the cass, but the book is not

critical of the Comminsion or of its conclusions. Portrait of the Aapaesis

containe very few references to CIA (pages 13, 17-19, 21, 23-26,

" 61, 152-3.

391, 352, 460), and t

ose are unchjectionable. Only alight mention is made

of the charge put forth by Oswald'a mother and othere that Cawald may

have been a CIA agent.

In his conclusions, Ford stresses the importance

of meaningfel human te

Blonshipe", and that these are what Oswald lacked.

LD, OREOG

The Commission Cots Its irat Shock, deala with the charge, seriously

advanced by Texas law enforcement officials, that Oswald was in fact

an /'Di Aroat and sets forth some of the Commission'e deliberations se

to how best to prove the truth or falalty of thie claim which was alno

being raised by certala other individuale and pubile media. As Congreas-

man Ford and the Commiesion Report and testimoay point oul, the charge

was never sustained, However, Some of the writing in Chapter 1 la poss

sibly loose enough to allow for quotation out of context for those who sook

to damage the image of the 7BL In February, when CIA saw the galley

proofe el this book, this information was called to the attention of the

FBI on a confidential basie. However, no action vas probably taien by

thems because there appeare to be no change in the publicaed version

from the

text of the galley proofs.
