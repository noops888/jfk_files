ADDENDUM

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION CWC:gfs 10/16/65

San Juan has conducted extensive investigation into an explosion which

caused damage to the hull of the "Satrustegui" while moored in San Juan,

Puerto Rico, on October 9, 1965. There were approximately 100 passengers

aboard, but there were no known serious injuries, and the ship remained

atloat.

San Juan has submitted numerous items to the Laboratory to deter-

mine device or components used to cause explosion.

On October 13, 1965, Miami interviewed Dr. Orlando Bosch, head of

the militant Anti-Castro organization "Movimiento Insurrecional de

Recuperacion Revolucionaria" (MIRR), regarding an article in the 'Miami

Herald" newspaper, dated October 13, 1965, in which Dr. Bosch claimed

his "frogmen" attached a bomb to the ship which caused the explosion.

Dr. Bosch advised the Agents that commandos of the MIRR were responsible

for the mining of the "Satrustegui"; however, he denied he knew it was to be

done, and he refused to name the perpetrators.

Miami has also conducted extensive investigation to determine it

members of MIRR were actually responsible for the explosion or if, as in

the past, MIRR was attempting only to gain publicity in a effort to raise

funds.

The Spanish Ambassador has contacted the State Department regarding

this case, and we are keeping the White House, the State Department, and

the Department advised of developments regarding this incident. All offices

have been advised to afford this investigation expeditious attention.

Ris, cue.
