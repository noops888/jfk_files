be "a good friend, a rellable man, a college graduate, an established

man in tire

community.

According to Willianson, the frland was

approached because of the nature of his work to perform some sort of

task for the sroup, and he "knaw that something was wrong."

The friend

then learned all he could about the planned operation and eventually

talked with Hilllason about It. The friend told Willlanson that the

gun running operation had been going on for about a year.
