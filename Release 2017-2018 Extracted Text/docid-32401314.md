NOTES

NOFORN -

Cuba: Fidel Castro's two-hour speech of 23

November on President Kennedy's assassination re-

flects apprehension that US policy toward Cuba may

become even tougher than in the past. He pointed

out that President Kennedy's alleged promise not to

invade Cuba has been strongly attacked by "reaction-

aries" and stated that the President's death could

lead from a bad situation to a worse one.

while, the Cuban defensive military alert, ordered

immediately after the President's death, remains

in effect. (SECRET KIMBO)

Saudi Arabia after 4 January, when the latest exten-

sion of the UN Mission's mandate expires. (TOP

Italy: (Premier-designate Moro expects that the

proposed government's program will be approved by

the directing bodies of the coalition parties at their

meetings today. Party leaders could then begin ne-

which may take the rest of the week. Socialist Party

chief Nenni intends to force his party's acceptance

of the program even though he is faced with a threat

from the pro-Communist left wing to secede' (CON-
