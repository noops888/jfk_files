Page 2, Paragraph 2

He was coming to the FBI because he was

troubled by something that a good friend of his

(MIKE GIOCONDO) was trying to get him involved

GIOCONDO had approached him concerning a

"draft board demonstration like the one the

BERRIGANS were involved in."

Paragraph

3

GIOCONDO wanted his assistance in finding places

For large groups of people to stay overnight,

in finding a meeting hall, and the use of his

truck.

the assumed that the truck would be

used to move groups of people. His truck could

transport up to 20 people at one time.)

GIOCONDO

mentioned that there are about 25 people in the

area who are working on the matter and that

there are about 200 more who will be coming

to

the area from New York State and Pennsylvania

to provide assistance. The planning has been

going on for about 6 to 8 weeks, and GIOCONDO

has told him that many of the

"ex-religious"

people involved in the movement are people who

have been known to both GIOCONDO and him for

quite some

time...

• Paragraph 4

GIOCONDO has mentioned that the target site has

been photographed and has been under extended

surveillance by members of the group.. The group

meets nightly.

Paragraph 6

GIOCONDO has indicated to him that the "hit"

would take place within 2 or 3 weeks.

(From

first conversation with HARDY of June 25, 1971.,

Page 6, Paragraphs 3 & 4

HARDY asked GIOCONDO if they were still going to

go through with the "draft thing in Canden." TO

this GIOCONDO replied "definitely." GIOCONDO

said, "We're going to make a hit there."

(HARDY's

report to the FBI of his conversation with MIKE

GIÔCONDO on the afternoon of June 25, 1971.)

Page: 11, Paragraphs 4 & 5

HARDY advised that GRADY and his group are doing

a considerable amount of surveillance on the

Camden Post Office for the particular purpose of

watching the night watchman make his rounds inside

the Post Office.

HARDY felt that the break-in

will occur

some time between I a.n. and 4 a.m.

on a Monday morning.

HARDY advised that the break-in will occur within

the next couple of weeks and that GRADY and his

group are surveiling the Camden Post Office

fron the rooftop of the Town House Apartments on

meeting with the group on June 29, 1971.)

•Page• 12; Paragraphs: 2 & 3

HARDY advised that ANTOINETTE has been able to

get inside the Post Office on one occasion and

from her observations got a rough floor plan

of the 4th floor.

This floor plan does not go

into too much detail. He stated that when they

-4-

go in they will hit the 5th floor but are

apparently worried about the 4th floor for some

reason or reasons unknown to him. He advised

he did not know the exact details of how

ANTOINETTE got into the building.

TARDY advised that he has been given an assign.

nent to go into the lost urtice and set a deralle

floor plan of the uth and 5th floors, specifically

1ooking. for any electrical tape alarm systems

on the windows. HARDY made the

observation that

they are going to come into the Post Office

through a window on the 5th floor. GRADY and

his group are concerned about the key system as

Far as security measures are concerned.

They

want to know exactly where alarm systems are located

They also want to know how many windows and how

many windows line up with other offices on the

4th floor in order that they can check the guard's

movements when they have the Post Office under

surveillance.

"The following day, I went to the FBI Office in

Camden and asked them for advice.

I told them I

did not want my friends to go to jail. They told

me at the time, just to keep them posted on

developments.

I then went to the group of people

I had just mentioned, and in a short time they had

taken me into their confidence as a member and

fellow sympathizer."

HARDY advised that he remembered something

that he wanted to report which he had forgot

to report yesterday.

HARDY advised that two more

names were mentioned by GRADY as, in HARDY's

opinion, current sympathizers or in some way

helping

• GRADY in his activities. Their names

are MAUD and TOM O'DELL.

These people live in

Hi-Nella, N.J.. GRADY mentioned that in case his

group needed to rent a truck or U-haul, these

people would do it, and he implied from GRADY's

comments about the O'DELLS that they were a source

of possible income.

(HARDY's report to the FBI

. of

a meeting with GRADY's group July 6, 1971.)

Page 57, Paragraph 3

HARDY advised that last night, July 6, 1971, he

received a telephone call from MIKE GIOCONDO.

JOHN GRADY had called him and asked him to come

out a little bit earlier than when the group

normally meets. GRADY stated to MIKE that he

wanted to go over some slides and plans and to

prepare GENE DIXON and HARDY for their entrance

into the draft board this afternoon for the purpose

of gathering more information.

to the FBI of a meeting with GRADY's group on

July 6, 1971.)

• Page 58, Paragraphs 4 & 5

HARDY advised that after viewing the slides,

GENE DIXON engaged him in a conversation relating

to the proposed visit by DIXON and HARDY to the

draft board and that tentative arrangements were mad.

to meet at the White Tower at 3 p.m., this afternoon

The plan was then to go to the Post Office and

visit the

draft board. HARDY advised that one

of the things that they were instructed to find.

out while in the draft board is the physical

geography of the front as far as the alarm system

and fire escape is concerned. He noted GRADY'S grOUp

is only interested in the lA classifications.

One of the other things that they are

to

definitely observe is the location of the

watchman's key.

HARDY again related that they

were instrueted to check and see if there were

any alarns on the doors and windows and to

check the name on the filing cabinets so that

GRADY could know the type of lock on the cabinets.

He noted that there is a possibility that GRADY's

group could obtain a master key from KIRK, a fellow

in Philadelphia.

They were also instructed to

look for power sources in case the group that

goes into the draft board decides to take electric

drills.

HARDY advised that his second main objective along

with DIXON is

to check the second and third

floors on the .5th Street wing.

GRADY wanted to

know the

exact location

and what offices are

located where.

(HARDY's report to the FBI of

a meeting with GRADY's group on Jüly 6, 1971.)

Page 59, Paragraphs 1 & 5

HARDY related that the third objective is to

get down into the mail room and see if there is

an alarm panel box for the fire escape and to see

if it is clearly marked.

HARDY made the observation

that there is the possibility that someone from

GRADY's group could get down into the mail room

and turn off the alarm.

HARDY related that while he was with GIOCONDO en

route to the Town House Apartments, he had learned

from GIOCONDO that GIOCONDO had met two of GRADY'S

people from the Philadelphia group, but that he

only met then by their first names.

HARDY learned

that these two people are an ANNE (LNU) and a

BETH (LNU).

He explained that both are white

girls about 22 years old and that they work at the

bookstore in the vicinity of Temple University.

He explained that the reason

the Philadelphia group

has not been brought into this action is that they

are more radical than GRADY and they dress in a

more hippie type style, and that they play around

with the drug scene a little bit. He explained

that GRADY has a low opinion of them.

HARDY explainid that another topic of conversation.

with MIKE GIOCONDO was the East Coast Conspiracy

to Save Lives.

He advised that he pressed

GIOCONDO for more information about this group

and the 200 people that were mentioned earlier.

GIOCONDO answered the question by stating that

he had pressed GRADY in the early stages of this

thing but that GRADY had always pushed it aside

and pushed. GIOCONDO very hard to recruit people

for this particular action. HARDY advised that

at the meeting GRADY had stated to him that he

was involved in the Dow Chemical action in Michigan.

GRADY did not say what the names were of-those

involved but stated that it was a simple operation.

(HARDY's report to the FBI of a meeting with

GRADY'S

group on July 6, 1971.)

Page 65, Paragraph 4

HARDY mentioned that GRADY had decided that one

of the things that he would like to have checked

would be to see whether or not the employees

of

the Post Office actually sign out when they léave

the Post Office for the day. GRADY had mentioned

to him that it might be possible for several

people to go into the Post Office together during

the day and for all of them, except one, to hide

in the Post Office while one of the group would.

leave and sign the entire group out at the register.

GRADY's group on July 7,

Page 67, Paragraphs 2, 3, 8 4

GRADY mentioned POPPI SHARPE during the meeting

last night, and it was apparent to HARDY that

GRADY has been talking extensively with POPPI

SHARPE

from time to time. GRADY mentioned that POPPI

SHARPE's favorite thought was

that "you have

to

put the fear back into the man" (meaning the

establishment). GRADY has mentioned how POPPI

SHARPE feels

that only when the authorities fear

the people will they respect them.

HARDY mentioned that GRADY desires that he and

DIXON go into the FBI office in Camden under suitably

pretext so that they might learn of information

relating to the alarm and security systems of the

been in other draft

boards before when records

were destroyed. He mentioned that GRADY related

to him that he was involved in draft board hits

From the conversations;

it was also indicated that COOKIE and ANIIA were

GRADY related this story with first-hand knowledge:

GRADY again emphasized that he has been the key

man in 14 out of 18 draft board hits within the

last 2-1/2 years. GRADY said that he was the one

who developed the style for the break-ins.

GRADY

said he is now developing the style for outside

break-ins.

Page 72, Paragraph 5

JOHN GRADY mentioned that this was the first time

## Page 17

that in the past they have gone into a

community where

there was some indication that

there were sympathizers in the area.

The sympa-

thizers would then set up observations

for three

to four weeks. GRADY and his assistants would

come into the area and spend another week doing

detail work.

The "old actors" would then come

in and spend two or three days assembling, con-

ducting dry runs, and getting the general feel

of the area.. After this the hit would be made

and they would then disperse, leaving three or

four local people behind.

by GRADY, he had at 5 o'clock on July 9, 1971:

observed the Postal employees as they left the

Post Office building.

departure of the Postal employees was to

determine if every individual was required to

sign out before leaving. On that same afternoon,

he saw COOKIE and ANITA downtown:

It was also mentioned that a girl named ANN

(last name unknown) from Philadelphia and the ANN

for whom there is a warrant in Delaware both worked

at the Temple Book Store with COOKIE and ANITA.

From what GRADY said on Friday night, it appeared

as if there was a draft board hit planned for the

Irenton area that never came off as yet.

It was

mentioned by the group that they had already

done the preparations

for a hit in Trenton, but

for some reason

the hit was not made.

They have

talked of going

back to Trenton after the Camden

hit to make the hit at Trenton which had previously

been worked

out.

GRADY is planning to run a surveillance with his

people tonight.

GRADY intends to surveil the

Post Office Building from the churchyard. As he

has done in the past, GRADY will play the role

of the "drunken Irishman" if any passersby or

police wander into the area. Plans call for

the entire group to be on the scene at the.

he was showing MEL MADDEN and TERRY that he and

his group had gone to some extremes to make this

action successful. GRADY related in the men's.

there is a suspended ceiling. GRADY related

some of his group lifted the panels out and slung

hammocks in the ceiling. On the night of the action

four men went into the men's room and hung in the

hamnocks for about six hours.

after closing

hours, it was just a matter of dropping through.

the ceiling and then proceeding to the draft board.

GRADY related that TONY SCOBLICK was. the person

who actually picked up the people who were inside

the building in a van.

The people knew they had

unt

4:45 in the morning to do their job on the draft

board because from previous surveillances GRADY

knew that the State Police only checked the building

at 4:35 a.m. GRADY went on to say that the group

inside the draft board was originally supposed

to come out the front door and that they put ply-

wood panels against the glass in the front door

so no one could

see in the draft board offices.

He went on to say after closing hours one of the

persons

inside had a power drill and was attempting

to arill the lock out but that he had a bad bit,

so this person went to the back door and just popped

it open and then the van pulled up from around

JOHN GRADY questioned GOOD as to what the Defense

Commattee would do with regard to the proposed

hit in Camden.

GOOD told GRADY that the Defense

Committee was totally uninterested in anything

that JOHN GRADY is doing at the moment.

It was

brought out during the conversation that a man

named PAUL, whose last name begins with "y"

(HARDY could not recall the last name); is on

the Defense Committee

in New York. GOOD mentioned

that there was at least $100,000 in the war

chest of the Defense Committee in New York City

and that this money is kept in a bank. Upon learning

this, GRADY became very upset, since he is almost

$20,000 in debt due to the fallure of three. or.

four book stores which he had run. (HARDY's

Upon their arrival at "Paul's Motors," MESHNICK :

went to the service area, followed by GRADY and

himself. PAUL appeared

very happy to see

MESHNICK but when he

saw GRADY his expression

changed. Upon greeting GRADY,

PAUL related

that the FBI had been to see him (PAUL) on Tuesday

wanting to know the whereabouts of JOHN GRADY,

and also wanting information regarding a car

bought by GRADY from him about a year and a half

ago.

It was PAUL's impression that the FBI has

this vehicle in their possession at this moment

in the Philadelphia area and that this car came

to the FBI's attention with regard to the Phila-

delphia draft board actions.

PAUL also believes

that he (PAUL) is under surveillance due to the

fact that he has been a financial supporter of

also due to the fact that for the last couple of

years he has been a supporter of the bast Coast

he had provided financial suppont and also trans-

previous draft board

to MEL MADDEN's apartment: GRADY had considered

going into

because he desired to confront some of the people

on the Defense Committee who were in his (GRADY's)

for him, GRADY

decided that it would be unwise to go to New York

City and decided instead to go to East Orange.

They were careful in driving to MADDEN's, parking

approximately a block away from MADDEN's

apartment.

As he (HARDY) came out of the apart

ment, Mrs. ELIZABETH MADDEN was driving up in her

car and called her and they all went into

MADDEN's apartment. . ELIZABETH MADDEN is an Irish

girl with dark black hair.

She has a small daughter

about eight months old named COLLEEN. ELIZABETH

this coming Friday.

She appeared to be knowledgeabl

as to her husband's involvement with the group.

MEL MADDEN and MIKE GIOCONDO and BUSBY arrived

shortly thereafter. A man by the name of STEVE,

who lives in the same apartment house on the first

floor and who works in the drug program with

MADDEN, also came to the apartment.

(HARDY'S

and "blew up" saying

that he was tired of being

in charge of everything, and that he wanted the

HARDY related that after "blowing up," GRADY left

the basement area during the meeting and was not

seen by the other members of the group for the

remainder of the evening. He mentioned that GRADY

has been sick with an ear and throat infection

for the last two or three days, and that Dr. ANDERSO:

examined him on Thursday night and had prescribed

some medicine for him.

He also observed that

GRADY is very tired due to the fact that he has

been getting very little sleep recently. The incider

that

caused GRADY to "blow Up" was when COOKIE

asked him what the positions would be for the night

"At first, the FBI instructed me not to present

any new thoughts or ideas to the group.

However, after a while they encouraged me to

suggest to the group the exact illegal

activities about which I had originally come to

them.

"They told me that all they wanted was enough

evidence of a conspiracy to raid the draft

board. They told me that this would be a lot

better than if some of my friends were charged

with the actual crime itself. I was greatly

confused at this time, but I trusted the FBI,

and eventually I carried out their wishes.

"By mid-July I had gained a strong leadership

position with the group. I told the FBI, with

who I was in daily contact at this time, that

this was not quite right. I was no longer a

mere informer but was now a promoter or

Response

Special Agent Michael M. Ryman advised that

from the very first contact made

with Hardy and

throughout the period Hardy furnished information

to the FBI he was instructed on numerous occasions

not to assume a position of leadership within the

group. Hardy was specifically told not to initiate

any resurgence of the plan to break into the draft

board if it appeared that the attempt was bogging

down.

He was specifically instructed that he

could do things requested by, instructed by, and

suggested by any members of the group.

specifically told that if the action to break into

the draft board "fell through," he was not to do

anything to resurrect it.

Further, at no time

were any promises made to him regarding the future

of the participants relative to arrests, charges,

or prosecution.

He was told on numerous occasions

that the United States Department of Justice was the

only authority empowered to authorize arrests in

this

situation.

HARDY related that in the first hour of conversation

the two girls were not present and that most of the

talking was done by GRADY. He felt that GRADY was

GRADY related to him that he ran

for the Senate in the Bronx in New York in 1955-56.

He stated that he was a sociologist and had gone

to college twice for four-year terms.

He apparently

spent four years in the Navy at the time of the

GRADY was not too clear about this.

GRADY further related to him that he was involved

in four previous draft board break-ins in Phila-

delphia a year and a half ago.

GRADY bragged about

how he helped to coordinate 50 to 60 people in

these draft board break-ins. GRADY stated that he

had been picked up about a year and a half ago

and that the authorities had a difficult time

finding out who he was.

GRADY stated that it

took them several months because, apparently,

they did not run a fingerprint. check on him.

Paragraph 5

HARDY described GRADY as a very dynamic individual

but that he, HARDY, felt that he was a little

crazy; but, nevertheless, he is the type of

Individual who inspires and motivates.

HARDY advised that he has been given an assignment

to go into the Post Office and get a detailed

floor plan of the fourth and fifth floors, speci

far as security measures are concerned.: They

want to know exactly where alarm systems are

located. They also want to know how many windows

and what windows line up with what offices on

the fourth floor in order that they can check

the guard's movements when they have the Post

Office under surveillance.

Page 13, Paragraph 1:

HARDY advised that ANTOINETTE

does all the

filing on the accumulation of information but

that GRADY actually runs the operation,

COOKIE,

HARDY observed, is a supplement to the team. HARDY

made the observation that MIKE GIOCONDO is a more

or less overpowered by GRADY's personality. HARDY

feels that this is due to GRADY's magnetism and

that it is of an intense quality so as to overcome

the average person who is not ready to cope with it.

Page 14, Paragraph 2

HARDY again questioned GRADY as to whether he would

need sleeping quarters and places where meetings

could be held for people coming into the Camden

area.

GRADY answered by stating that he was

not

totally sure about it and that he would confide

in

HARDY at a later date.

Paragraph 5

HARDY was instructed by GRADY to go into the Post

Office on June 30, 1971, to the fourth floor and

get a detailed floor plan. He was instructed to

ascertain, among other things, if there were

window locks on the fire

escape on the fourth and

fifth floors and whether the locks could be

opened from the outside;

and, if they have to be

forced, what type of tools would be needed, GRADY

also wanted him to check the alarm system again

on the windows on the fifth floor as to whether

there is or is not a system.

Page 17, Paragraph 2

HARDY stated the reason he thinks he has been

approached to help with this action is on the

recommendation of MIKE GIOCONDO.

GIOCONDO knows

from past experience that HARDY is efficient and

has been able to muster the type of people and

financial resources that can carry out. a given

task efficiently, HARDY has been able

in the

past to muster

the necessary physical resources,

such as trucks, cars and people.

in the event that those who go in the Draft Board.

would have to exit quickly. "It was suggested that

he could use the pretext of his truck being stalled.

HARDY agreed to this phase of the plan.

Last Paragraph

It is HARDy's opinion that these people who are

involved would not be so involved were it not for

the driving force and personal magnetism of

JOHN GRADY:

Page 22, Paragraph 2

He also told the group how he had gone to the

Selective Service Office and talked with the

receptionist to find out who was in charge of the

who is Mrs. FURLONG (phonetic). He discussed

with Mrs, FURLONG the draft status of ex-convict:

pon thein release from prison, and whether or noi

they had to sign up with the Draft Board upon

able to note the number of windows, the type of

locks, and whether there were any type of

electical

devices on the windows that would set off the

alarm.

He was unable to note any electrical

devices and so related this to the group.

He was

able to see the fire escape window, through which

the group intends to gain entry. He related all

GENE DIXON engaged him in a conversation relating

to the proposed visit by DIXOil and HARDY to the

draft board and that tentative arrangements were ma

to meet at the white lower at 3 p.m., this afternoo

The

plan was then to go to the Post Office and

visit the draft board. HARDY advised that one

of the things that they were instructed to find

out while in the draft board is the physical

geography of the front as far as the alarm system

and fire escape is concerned. He noted GRADY's grou

is only' interested in the lA classifications.

One of the other things that they are to

definitely observe is the location of the

watchman's key.

HARDY again related that they

were inscructed to check and see if there were

any alarms on the doors and windows and to

check the name on the filing cabinets so that

GRADY could know the type of

lock on the cabinets.

He noted that there is a possibility that GRADY's

group could catain a master key from KIRk, a fellow

in Philadelphia.

They were also instructed to

look for power sources in case the group that

goes. into the draft board decides to take electric

drills.

HARDY advised that his second main objective along

with DIXON is to check the second and third

HARDY related that the third objective is to

get down into the mail room and see if there is

an alarm panél box for the fire escape and to see

if it is clearly marked.

HARDY made the observation

that there is the possibility that someone from

GRADY's group could get down into the mail room

and turn off the alarm.

HARDY related that while he was with GIOCONDO en

route to the Town House Apartments, he had learned

From GIOCONDO that GIOCONDO had met two of GRADY'S

people from the Philadelphia group, but that he

only met them by their first names.

HARDY learned

that these tro people are an ANNE (LNU) and a

BETH (LNU). He explained that both are white

girls about 22 years old and that they work at the

bookstore in the vicinity of temple University.

He explained that the reason the Philadelnhia group

has not been brought into this action is that they

are more radical than GRADY and they dress in a

more hippie type style.

and that they nlay around

with the drup scene a little bit.

He explained

that GRADY has a low opinion of them.

with MIKE GIOCONDO was the East Coast Conspiracy

to Save Lives.

He advised that he pressed

GIOCONDO for more information about this group

and the 200 people that were mentioned

earlier.

GIOCONDO answered the question by stating that

he had pressed GRADY in the early stages of this

thing but that GRADY had always pushed it aside

and pushed GIOCONDO very hard to recruit people

for this particular action.

at the meeting GRADY had stated to him that he

was involved in the Dow Chemical action in Michigan

GRADY did not say what the names were of those

involved but stated that it was a simple operation.

Page 65, Paragraph 4

HARDY mentioned that GRADY had decided that one

of the things that he would like to have checked

would be to see whether or not the employees of

the Post Office actually sign out when they leave

the Post Office for the day.

GRADY had mentioned

to him that it might be possible for several

people to go into

the Post Office together during

the day and for all of them, except one, to hide

in the Post Office while one of the group would.

leave and sign the entire group out at the register.

the pretext of trying to learn from the FBI the

procedure used in investigating an, ex-convict

who applies for a job with the Post Office. MARTHA

SHEMLEY and GENE DIXON also

mentioned the pros-

pects of going

into the FBI Office. As the plans

stand now, the draft board is target #1. Army

• Intelligence is possibly a

second target and, if

it is feasible, the FBI Office would be the third

target.

From conversations with the group, HARDY has

learned that COOKIE: ANITA and JOHN GRADY have

been in other draft boards before when records

were destroyed.

as if there was a draft board hit planned for the

Trenton area that never came off as yot. It was

on on an on the

mentioned by the group that they had already

for a hit in Trenton,

but

for some reason the hit was not made. They have

been

worked out.

GRADY is planning to run a surveillance with his

people tonight.

GRADY intends to surveil the

Post Office Building from the churchyard. As he

HARDY advised that POPPI SHARPE had been contacted

apparently by Grady during the past week and that

he has committed eight people for the exterior

defense on the night of the action. SHARPE'S

people are to create some kind of

a problem if

it is needed. HARDY explained this would be

some

sort of a diversionary tactic to call attention

away from the post office.

Nothing more was

said about the napalming of the army tank in

front of the Reserve Center in Camden, although

it had been referred to during the course of the

discussion some half a dozen times.

HARDY advised another name was brought up.

This

person might possibly become involved in the action

and from GRADY's comment this person has experience

and

has participated in past actions. GRADY

mentzoned the name BUSBUY Or BUZLARD. HARDY

advised GRADY did not go into detail regarding

BUSBUY .

will be able to bring, will report to the ANDERSON's

home

for a briefing and will then be paired off

with

some of the people who are already involved

in the Camden action.

The tentative "hit time"

is going to be between 11:30 p.m., and 12:30 a.m.

As yet GRADY and his group have not set the time

for sure.

HARDY advised while participating with

the group in the surveillance last night the group

could have gone in at 11:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.

He explained the surveillance workings. as follows:

- 65 -

NW 55302 DocId:32989694 Page 68

## Page 69

The surveillance commenced at 11:30 a.m. with every

one in the pre-arranged checkpoints..

Observations

were made for a full ten minutes and then at 11:40

observations were again made as if 11:30 did not

happen.

These are carried out every ten minutes

until approximately 12:20 a.m. This information

which is compiled by each member of the surveillance

is then discussed the next evening and each person

at the prescribed times states what was seen.

FOr

example, there was a patrol car on Market Street

at 11:30 p.m., so that would knock out the 11:30 to

12:40 time frame. Another example given by HARDY

was that at 11:50 p.m., the watchman looked out

the bathroom window.

the ceiling and then proceeding to the drait board.

GRADY related that. TONY SCOBLICK was the person

who actually picked up the people who were inside

the building in a van. The people knew they had un

4:45 in the morning to do their job on the draft

board because from previous surveillances GRADY

knew that the State Police only checked the buildin

at 4:35 a.m.

GRADY went on to say that the group

inside the draft board was originally supposed

to come out the front door and that they put ply-

wood panels against the glass in the front door

so no one could see in the draft board offices.

He went on to say after closing hours one of the

persons inside had a power drill and was attempting

to drill the lock out but that he had a bad bit,

so this person went to the back door and just poppe

it open and then the van pulled up from around

Page 90, Paragraphs 2 & 4

Plans for the hit at the draft board in Camden,

N.J., as discussed by JOHN GRADY, call for

entry to be made by driving a van, with the hit

team inside, up to the back of the Post Office.

A member of

the team would then use a ladder as

a brace against the fire escape. Members of

the team would then enter the fire escape and

go up the fire escape to the point where the

fire escape leads to the window of the local

draft board.

Plans call for one walkie-talkie

to be with the people who are on the roof of

the Townhouse Apartments and for one walkie-

talkie to be with the group that goes into the

draft board.

HARDY mentioned that the idea of hitting the Army

Intelligence Office was brought forth by cookie.

Upon this being mentioned, GRADY made some mention

that it would

JOHN GRADY questioned GOOD as to what the Defense

Committee would do with regard to the proposed

hit in Canden. GOOD told GRADY that the Defense

Committee was totally uninterested in anything

that JOHN GRADY is doing at the moment.

It was

brought out during the conversation that a

man

named PAUL, whose last name begins with

"M"

(HARDY could not recall the last name), is on

the Defense Committee in New York. GOOD mentioned

that there was at least $100,000 in the war

chest.of the Defense Committee in New York City

•and that this money is kept in a bank. ' Upon learni

this, GRADY became very upset: since he is almost

$20,000 in debt due to the failure of three or

four book stores which he had run.

changed. Upon greeting GRADY, PAUL related

that

It was

PAUL's impression that the FBI has

this vehicle in their possession at this moment

in the Philadelphia area and that this car came

to the FBI's attention with regard to the Phila-

delphia draft board actions:

PAUL also believes

that he (PAUL.) is under surveillance due to the

fact that he has been a financial supporter of

JERRY MESHNICK in his World Federalist group and

also due to the fact that for the last couple of

years he has been a supporter of the East Coast

Conspiracy to Save Lives and also a supporter of

various draft board actions.

PAUL indicated that

he had provided financial support and also trans

portation in connection with previous draft board

hits.

After leaving "Paul's Motors" which is a

Volvo dealership, they went to tast range:

N.J.,

to MEL MADDEN's apartment. GRADY had considered

going into

New York City instead of East Orange

because he desired to confront some of the people

on the Defense Committee who were in his (GRADY's)

it would be unwise to go to New York

city and decided instead to go to East Oranse.

They were careful in driving to MADDEN's, parking

approximately a block away from MADDEN's

apartment.

As he (HARDY) came out of the apart-

ment, Mrs: ELIZABETH MADDEN was driving up in her

vehicle.

When GRADY saw her he got out of the

car and called her and they all went into

MADDEN's apartment.

ELIZABETH MADDEN is an Irish

girl with dark black hair.

She has

a small daughte

about eight months old named COLLEEN. ELIZABETE

MADDEN will be going to Ireland for four weeks

this coming Friday.

She appeared to be knowledgeab

as to her husband's involvement with the group.

MEL MADDEN and MIKE GIOCONDO and BUSBY arrived

shortly thereafter. A man by the name of STEVE,

who lives in the same apartment house on the first

floor and who works in the drug progran with

MADDEN, also came to the apartment.

(HARDY'S

report to the fBi of a meeting with GRADY's group

Page 108, Paragraphs 4 & 5

HARDY observed that GRADY appeared very muody

and "blew up" saying that he was tired of being

in charge of everything, and that he wanted the

other members of

the group to take more initiative.

He directed these comments to COOKIE and ANITA.

examined him on Thursday night and had prescribed

some medicine for him:

He also observed that

GRADY is very tired due to the fact that he has

been getting very little sleep recently. The incide

that caused GRADY to "blow Up" was when COOKIE

asked him what the positions would be for the night

said to COOKIE that he was tired of being the

"professional manager" of the group; and that

other members of the group should also assume

some initiative.

not want anyone outside of those in attendance

on that night to know any further details re-

garding the hit.

When MEL MADDEN questioned

GRADY with regard to the definite time and

date of the hit, GRADy replied that the hit

would take place within the next ten to four-

teen days.

GRADY also mentioned that if the

hit was not made within the next fourteen days.

then it would have to be cancelled. ANITA

mentioned that a prime consideration within

the underground movement is that individuals

messing patient, especially with regard to

the

of a draft board.

MADDEN stated

that after the draft board hit

was completed, the group

should sit down and

discuss what

further activities would be under

taken by this particular segment of the East

Coast Conspiracy group. MADDIN indicated to

the group

that he felt that the tine for draft

board hits was over. From what MADDEN said, it

A slide projector was then brought forth and

slides were

shown.

These slides were slides of

the Post office which MIKE GIOCONDO had taken.

The members of the group then discussed the

different ways by which they could gain access

to the draft board mindor.

While this was being

done, COOKIE and ANITA were setting up the chart

which

dealt with the commitments for the surveil-

lance for

that nisht. A new surveillance point

is now being used by the prouD.

It was mentioned that if the group is able

to determine a stable pattern,

that the

sossibly will be able to set six on sever

or two of them could

take a shot'

at the

Army Intelligence Office or even the FBI

Office.

The group is now considering a Saturday

night as well as Sunday night as the possible

night for the

hit. The reason for this is

that from their surveillance, they have found

that the various patterns on

saturdays rould

possibly be more conducive for a successful

hit than those on Sundays.

It was mentioned

that DIXON's apartment would be used

as-sleeping

quarters for

some of the "old actors" who would

be coming in for the hit. Dr. ANDERSON's flat

on Broadway and Royden, above his office, and

MIKE GIOCONDO's apartment would also be used

as sleeding quarters for those "old actons"

who would be coming in for the hit.

Those members of the group who conduct

surveillances

fron the Rutgers Law School

are able to gain entry through the door on

the 5th Street side... This is a door with

a plywood panel which is wired.

They have

snapped the wires and re-wrapped them with

their fingers, making it possible with very

little effort for them to lift the panel and

thereby gain entry.

surveillances fron the Law

School are conducted either from the fifth

1100k, south side offices, or from the rooftop

itself.

ANITA mentioned that

from the Law School,

that she could

see his, HARDY's, van, which

was located in the alley behind

the Post Office.

She also nentioned that she had a very good view

of the Post Office building.

GOOD had mentioned that he was able to recruit

•four or

five people from New York for this

operation.

GRADY still plans to be on the rooftop of the

Town House

Apartments at the time of the hit.

The members of the groun feel that the

They feel that if these

that they will be successful in setting

all their neonle from the van

onto the roof

of the Post Office building. Plans call for

two cars to be used to block those inter

GRADY has said that if the action does not

take place within ten days, that he would

• leave the area.

GRADY indicated that he has a problem with

the Defense Committee in that they (the

Defense Committee) want to work only with

the defense of the people who have been arrested

in connection with various actions, whereas

GRADY wants them to provide money for offense,

that is the actual performing.of

actions.

GRADY has indicated that the Defense Comnittee :

is more interested in coming in after the action

is over and helding the people who have been

charged: and arrested.

GRADY has said that he was one of the main organ-

izers of "this thing," two and

one-half years ago,

but that new peodle have come into the organizatio

and taken over. GRADY said that these people

do not have the same feeling in respect for GRADY':

thoughts as he would prefer them to have.

GRADY indicated that he made a break with the

grous several months ago, and that now he is

attempting to retain his

position within the

group.

GRADY indicated that he is doing this

because he feels that he needs the group.

the defense of the people who have been arrested

in connection with various actions, whereas

GRADY wants them to provide money for offense,

that is the actual performing of actions.

In referring to previous operations, COOKTE

that they have always been on the

picking up the draft records They mentioned

that they were involveô in the Philadelphia hits

and the trenton hit.

COOKIE and ANITA both

they were on the inside of the Philadelphia

draft board break-in and that they have helped

carry the records from the building. They

(COOKIE and ANITA) mentioned that they carried

the draft board records around in the trunk of

their car for about a month before they actually

destroyed them.

Some of the records mentioned

were ledger books that were used for cross

reference within the drait board system.

GRADY related this story with first-hand knowledge.

GRADY again emphasized that he has been the key

man in l4 out of the 18 draft board hits within

the last 2a years

(HARDY's report to the FBI. Of

his meeting

After midnight,

she did go to the public

Police Office and made several

phone calls.

procedure in making the calls is for COOKIE to •

call one number where ANN will answer ANN will

then hang up and go to another phone booth,

which has been predetermined, and COOKIE will cal]

her there.

They do this to Insure that ANN Is

not being followed. AN and another girl, whose

name was

not mentioned, were,

according to COOKTE

and ANITA, to pick them (COOKTE and ANITA) up

and take them to Trenton, or somewhere in North

New Jersey today for the lecture in connection

with the MEL MAdDEN dig prograin.

JOHN

Grady mentioned that this was the first

time they tried to hit a drait board from the

outside and that it was the firsi time they had

tried to get community involvement.

GRADY related

to him that in the past they have gone

into &

community where there was some indication that

there were sympathizers in the area.

The sympathizers

would then set up observations for three to four

weeks.

GRADY and his assistants would come into

the area and spend another week doing detail work.

The "old

actors" would then come in and spend two

or three days assembling, conducting dry-runs and

getting the general feel of the area.

After this,

the hit

would be made and they would then disperse,

With regard to KIRK,

the locksmith in Philadelphia,

HARDY has learned that he, KIRK, is undor 30 years

of age.

He has also learned that Father MICHAEL

DOXLE has, through KIRK's instructions: become

very proficient in lock picking

(HARDY's report

to the FBI of his meeting with GRADY's group on

July 8, 1971).

Page 74= paragraph 1

HARDY explained the procedure by which the group

gains entry to the roof of the l'ownhouse Apartmonts.

They use a credit card, which has been out in balf

lengthwise, and slip it behind the bolt or tumbler

to the door which loads into the lobby of the

Poinhouse Apartments.

They then apply pressure

to the left with the credit cards while pulling

out the handle of the door with their froe hand.

This causes the door to open. Alter doing this,

they walk through the lobby and take the elevator:

to the 5th Il00r. Upon leaving the elevator, most

of the people in the group take off their shoes.

They then take the stairwell up to the bth iloor and

onto the roof. It has been agreed upon within the

group that the first person to arrive on the roor

on any particular night will prop the door open by

means of a bar. (HARDY's report to the FBI of his

meeting with GRADY's group on July 8, 1971).

Page 80, paragraph 1 .

COOKIE and ANITA mentioned a small, thin man from

Philadelphia, who has the background and makeup

to go into the drait board. They did not mention

him by name but did mention that he had sone into

draft boards in the past.

of his meeting with GRADY's grOUp on July 9s 1971).

as li there was a drott board hit

planned for the Trenton area

that never came

off as yet. it was mentioned by the group that

thoy had already done the preparations for a

hit in trenton, but for some reason the hit

was not made.

They have talked of going back

to trenton after the Camden hit to make the hit

at Trenton, which had previously been worked out.

Fron the conversations, it was HARDY's Under-

standing there were possibly two draft boards

being surveilled in the Irenton area but only

one of them was hit. It was mentioned

that

COOKIE and ANIlA should go back to Trenton for

th: second hit. (HARDY's report-to the FBI of his

meeting with GRADY'S grOUP on July 10, 1971)

Page 86, paragraph 4

HARDY advised in the course of the conversation,

some people and would try to get some money from

the Defense Committee.

MADDEN

HARDY advised that POPPI SHARPE had been contacted,

apparently by Grady, during the past week and

that he has comnitted eight people for the

exterior defense on the night of the action.

SHARPE's peoplo are to crcate some kind of a

On July 18, 1971, he went to the residence

of Doctor WILLIAM ANDERSON, Collingswood,

N.J., arriving at approximately, 8:30 p.m.

Upon entering the residence, he noted that

those in attendance were JOIN GRADY, MEL

MADDLA,

GENE DIXON, MARTHA SHEMELEY, MIKD

GIOCONDO, BOR GOOD, ANITA, and COOKIE. He

noted that the conversation as he entered

was centered upon the fact that the target

date had been tentatively set.

It was men

tioned by members of the group that they did

not want anyone outside of those in attendance

on that night to know any further details re-

garding

the hit. When MEL MADDEN questioned

GRADY with regard to the definite time and

date of the hit, GRADy replied that the hit

would take place nithin the next ten to four-

teen days.

GRADY also mentioned that if the

hit was not made within the next fourteen days,

then it would have to lic cancelled. ANITA

mentioned that a prime consideration within

the underground movement is that individuals

must be patrent, especially with regard to the

"casing''"of

a draft board.

MADDEN stated that after the draft board hit

was completed, the group should sit down and

discuss what further activities would be under-

taken by this particular segment of the East

Coast Conspiracy group.

MADDIN indicated to

the proup that he felt that the time fon draft

From what MADDEN said, it

vas his, HARDY's, impression that the draft boanc

hit in Trenton either apparently

"Did not come

off" or that it vas unsuccessful.

A slide projector was then brought forth and

slides were shown.

These slides were slides of

the Post Office which MIKE GIOCOlDO had taken.

The members of the group then discussed the

different ways by which they could gain access

to the draft board window.

While this was being

done, COOKIE and ANITA were setting up the chart

which dealt with the commitments for the surveil-

lance for

that night. A new surveillance point

is now being used by the group.

to determine a stable pattern,

that they

possibly will be able to get sin 'or seven

or two of then could

"take a shot" at the

Army Intelligence Office or even the FBI

Office.

The group is now considering a Saturday

night as well as sunday night as the possible

night for the hit. The reason for this is

that from their surveillance, they have found

that the various patterns on Saturdays would

possibly be more conducive for a successful

hit than those on Sundays.

It was mentioned

that DIXON's apartment would be used as sleeping

quarters for some of the "old actors"

Camden

"Draft Board action' as told to hin

on July 19, 1971, at Doctor ANDERSON's resi-

dence, collingswood, N.J., by JOHN GRADY,

ANITA, and COOKIE.

The plan involves about 22 beople, approxi-

mately 10 automobiles, and 4 walkie-talkies

(which are referred to as "headsets" by

members of the group. The plan is initially

concentrated

on three points.

The first key

point is the "number two position" on the

Townhouse Apartment roof.

There will be four

people on the roof of the Townhouse Apartments.

One will be at the rear of the building looking

toward the alley behind the Post Office building.

The "number two position" is the key position

of the entire operation.

The person in the

number two position will be the individual

who gives the signal to start or stop the

operation dedending on the situation as

seen

by the lookout.

The "number three" and "number

four" positions are "lookouts" who will be on

the Townhouse Apartment root looking east and

west on Cooper Street.

These individuals wil

be within walking distance of the number two

position.

Plans call for JOHN GRADY to have •

the number two of key position.

A second key position is an automobile which

will be darked by the

Ben Franklin Bridge on

Fifth Street in the vicinity of Fifth and Penn

Streets.

The individual in this

vehicle will

have

: a direct view of the third key position

which will be a person standing on the southwest

who is in the vicinity of Fifth and Penn

The man on Fifth and Market

that Market Street and Fifth Street are clear

of any police cars.

There i a sen

There will be two individuals in the car

located at Fifth and Penn Streets.

When the

individuals in the car observe the man to

cross the street, they

will say "go" over

This will be received

by JOHN GRADY, the "key man" on the roof of the

Townhouse Apartments.

When GRADY hears the

word "go" as transmitted from the car at Fifth

and Penn Streets he (GRADY) will look to the

people at the number three and number four

positions.

If they indicate to him that Market

Street is clear he (GRADY) will then say "go"

These are the only

walkie-talkie transmissions which will take

place on the night of the action.

At this point it

As the last man goes over the second floor

roof he will pull the ladder up behind him

so that it will not be visible, They have

determined that they need about sixty seconds

to get the people from the van onto the roof.

While members of the "hit team" are going up

the ladder the cars, if need be, will start

moving down Market Street, down Fifth Street,

across from Fourth and Cooper Streets, across

from Fourth and Market Streets so that they

will effectively block off all entrances so

that no one can see the van.

for the light on Market Street. Two cars will

be parked on

either side of the street on Fifth

Street pulling out after the man (Fifth and

Market Streets) gets halfway across the street.

In other words this gives the man at the key

position located at Fifth and Penn Streets clear

vision of the man crossing the street.

The two cars on Fifth Street will then pull out

so as to effectively cut off Fifth Street from

any Market Street approach.

The traffic light

signal will dictate which of the two cars will

start down Market Street first.

At the same time a car will be on Fourth Street

waiting for the light at Fourth and Market Streets

This vehicle will be on the southeast corner of

that intersection. There will also be another

car between larket Street and Markley Alley.

Another car will

be at Fourth and Cooper Strcets

the surveillances the group makes notations for

the street to the White Tower.

The man

original positions and wait another ten minutes

in order to get everything up again.

FOr

instance, if it is originally planned to

initiate the action at 11:50 but the second

"go" signal is not received,

everyone will

return to their original positions and wait

until 12 o'clock. midnight.

At 12 o'clock

nidnight then the man on Fifth and Market

Streets would make his determination as to

whether the area is clear or not clear and he

would again step off and cross the street and

thereby initiating the cycle.

The critical man is the man at the corner of

Fifth and Market Streets.

If he does not step

off from the corner nothing is initiated.

Other than GRADY, it has not been firmly set

up as to what individuals will be in what

position.

He believes, however, that COOKIE

and ANITA will be part of the team that goes

up on the roof.

The procedure for coming out of the building

will be the same as the procedure followed when

going Into the building:

The cars will line.up

in their original dositions and the "go" signal

will have to be given so that the man on the

roof on the man in the van has some way of knowin

that all is clear. The

cars

will again block

the intersection. It is anticinated that since

the hit team will be carrying bags or back packs

with possibly forty to fifty pounds of files that

it will take longer for them to exit than it did

fon them to enter.

At this point it is anticipatc

that the hit team will use back packs since this

an incident in dilmington,

the lock out of the door in order to gain exit

through the front door.

When they were not

able to do this the idea was passed between

GRADY and those

on the inside by walkie talkie

that they should go around the rear exit of

the building.

GRADY mentioned that he listened

over the walkie-talkie as they went through

the building and that: he heard a loud. sound.

that sounded

much like a

shot. On hearing this

GRADY: assumed that the "inside team" had kicked

the glass out oi the back door because they

were

unable-to get it unlocked. At this doint he

decided to

go to the rear of the building in

order to pick them up..

In their haste to do

this SCOBLICK broke off the antenna without.

antenna either when he wound up the window or when

he pulled it in.

covered that the antenna was broken. (HARDY'S

van that could be rented by the group.

GRADY

said that he would like to have someone other

than HARDY drive the van that would go into

the alley. GRADY said that his reason for this

was

that they could afford to lose "the other

indians"

, but that they could not afford to

lose hin (HARDY). because he was needed in the

movement. GRADY told HARDY that there were

very few people in the movement who could think

and work at the same time, and that HARDY was

one of these people.

HARDY learned that MIKE GIOCONDO had taken

order to locate a suitable truck sufficient

for the group's needs. HARDY exDlained that

it was now decided that the group wants sort

of a stake-body like cruck with at least six-

foot walls. He explained that they want the

open-bed truck because they want to be able

to just flip the ladders onto the roof and

way the entrance team will not have

to get out of the truck to get un the ladders.

Page 32, Paragraph 2

HARDY advised that he and GRADY, after a twenty

minute period, left ANDERSON's station wagon

in the parking lot and went to the alley behind

the post office to get the feel of the alley.

He explained this was done to lose any physical

nervousness that one might have upon entering

a strange area at night. HARDY explained he

and GRADY walked down the alley, cut to the

left into a little alley which is located

behind the Brass Rail Restaurant, which is

next to the Post Office Building. They paused

a little while in this alley and observed

fire escape which is attached to the Post

Office Building.

Grady discussed with him how

his group was going to bypass the alarm system

on the fire escape.

GRADY related to HARDY that

he was there yesterday during the light hours

and that he noticed that a wire runs along the

wall to the fire escape. GRADY, at this time,

seemed to think that the alarm was a fire-type

alarm and not a burglar alarm, assuming that

when it is pulled down, the alarm will go off.

HARDY advised that a little later it was

suggested by someone whom he does not recall

that the group play basketball in the churchyard

across the street and throw a basketball on the

IOOf.

They then intend to go inside the

building and ask the guard if he could somehow

get up on the roof so that they can retrieve

their basketball.

HARDY stated the reasoning

behind this plan is that the guard will have

to turn off the alarm before the fire escape

steps can be pulled down. It was

therefore

decided that this coming Sunday night there will

be a basketball game at about 8 o'clock. The

participants will be GENE DIXON, JOHN GRADY,

MICHAEL DOYLE and HARDY and probably two other men.

After dinner and at about 8:15 p.m., until

approximately 9:10 p.m., GRADY, ANITA, COOKIE,

practiced going up the ladder which was in

the back yard of his residence.

They went

we the dead o

up the ladder onto the back roof of his

residence and then went through the back

bedroom window. They did this so that they

might determine how long it might take the

slowest member of the group to go up the

ladder.

meeting with GRADY's group on August 5, 1971.)

GRADY, last night, instructed HARDY to arrange

ROBERT WILLIAM HARDY, 65 South 29th Street, Canden,

N. 5., telephone number 662-2603, came to the Canden Resident

Agenoy of the FBI and advised as follows:

He was coming to the

FBI because he was troubled

by something that a good friend of his (MIKE GIOCONDO, was

trying to get him involved in.

GIOCONDO had approached hin

concerning a "äraft board demonstration like the one the

BERRIGANs were involved in."

GIOCONDO wented his assistance in finding places

for large groups of people to stay overnight, in finding a

meating hall, and the use of his truol.

(He assumed that

the truck would be used to move groupe of people.

His truck

could transport up to 20 people at one time. GIOCONDO men-

tioned that there are about 25 people in the area who ane

working on the matter and that there are

about 200. more who

wiJI be

coming to the area fron New York State and Pennsylvanis

to provide assistance.

The plannine has been going on for

about six to eight weeks, and GIOCONDO has told him that many

GRADY related to him that he

ran for the Senate in the Bronx

in New York in 1955-56.

He stated that he was a sociologist

and had gone to college twice-for four-yeer terms. He

apparently spent four years in the Navy at the time of the

Korean war-

GRADY was not too clear about this. CRADY fur-

ther related to him that he was involved in four previous

draft board break-ins in Philadelphia a year and a half ago.

GRADY bragged about how he helped to coordinate 50 to 60

people in these draft board break-ins.

GRADY stated that

he had been picked up about a year and a half ago and that

the authorities had a difficult time finding out who he was.

GRADY stated that It took them several months because,

apparently, they did not run a fingerprint check on him.

HARDY described GRADY as a

very dynamic individual

but that he, HARDY, felt that he was a little crazy: but,

nevertheless, he is the type of individual who inspires and

motivates.

as to

HARDY edvised that the two girls are from Philam

GrAdy further related that this thing wes just too bie for

CRADY appears very cincere in what he is doing.

HARDY again questioned. GRADY as to tether he would

need sleeping querters.and places were meetings could be

held for people comine into the Cauden area:

GRADY answered

by stating that he was

not totally sure about it and that

he

would confide

GRADY refers to his vife as

HARDY then related

that the 200 people figure

that was mentioned was perhaps a little bit misleading in

that this is a political ploy,

He explained that GRADY was

trying to present a picture of greater strength than he

actually has.

This is something that is developed from

the votes.

HARDY was instructed by GRADY to CO into the Post

They had made a point in instructing HARDY that he also check

out the Irmy Intelligence Office when he is on the fourth

Of MIKE GIOCONDO.

GIOCORDO knows from pant erperience that

Mandy is efficient and has been able to musior the type of

people and financiul resourcos thai can carry out & given

task efficiently.

HARDY has been able in the past to mister

the necessary physical rosources, such as trucks, cars and

people.

HARDY advised that the men in GRADY's group ere

definitely the leaders.

The women seem to le nothing more

then tools or servants of the men.

They seen to consist of

religious and ex-religions; however, some of the religious

and ex-religious women appear to le on exception to this rnle.

They seem to have some kind of controling factor. He described

the group as a loosely init organization over a larce area

and they are able to muster a certain amount of

peonle at any

civen time if it is worked out and planned.

It seems thet

most of the people are either under surveillance or have

arrest records and, as such, makes it very difficult for

them to freely move about.

Wost of the people of which GRADY

speaks are "youth" who are freshly out of religious orders.

GRADY mentioned many people in the Philadelphia

area who were involved in the four draft rocord incidents

a year and a half ago who seem to be these ex-religious.

He could not remember the nanes that were mentioned,

GRADY,

however, advised.him that they would be coming in to help

and he indicated that the people would be fron Philadelphia

and

Hew York.

HARDY offered the opinion that GRADY ind his

group seen to specialize in draft boards and that they

spend two to three months surveiline the place before the

"action" nctually takes place. GRIDY stated they have boen

very successful in this endeavor and have been able to ret

arey clean wich a few minor piek-ups.

In offering a further opinion of GRADE, HARDY

advicod that CraDY is a very emotional type.

He is the

first

reneration of Irish immigrants and he

still feels

some kind

of alloriance to treland and their revolutionary

the Ili. He can remember with a creat deal of pession

as black and tons) of the british troy, wich consisted

convicts who were riven full pardons in return for two years

of service in Ireland in order to terrorize the Irish people.

GR/DY feels the same type of hatred in relation.to.lau

He did not

N.do, was

interviered and advised as follows:

On June 30, 1971, he went to a meeting at the home

of Doctor ANDERSON, Harding Avenue and Coopex Drive, Collings

Prusent at this meeting were Mika Glocondo, Jor

GRADY, COOKIE and ANTOINeTTe, who is also know as ANITA.

He questioned them as to how they were obtaining the food which

they

had avery night.

They eat at approxinately 9:00 p.s. every

evening, having a community meal. Apparently until last week

when they were under sunveillance by the FBi, fifteen or twenty

prople vers meting every night for the community meal.

He learned

fom CoOkie and ANITA that they go out and steal food

from & local

supermarket so that they do not have to spend money for the food.

They also told him that they go to local liquor fairs and steal

the whiskey and wine which they have with their meals.

Their group at the meeting, was very well pleased wich

the f100r plan that he was able to produce for the Selective

Service office.

The group plans that when they make the hit,

they will go up the outside fire escape and through the window inco

the Drift Board office,

thereby eliminating the need for keys on

the need for anyone hiding within the building.

The group desires

chac HARDY

to determine where

the files are kept for those registrants who

The group has indicated. that when hitting the

Draft Board they will be concerned only with the l-A classification

files. At this time they are unsure as to whether or not they

will carry the files from the office or whether they will destroy

them on the spot.

The group's second target, if possible, is

to hit the Arny Intelligence Office located on the fourch

floor

oi the U.S. Post Office Building.

They are interested in taking

files such

as the files that were taken from the FBI Office in

Media, Pa.

It was HARDY'S

impression fron discussions with the

group

that the theft of the FBI files in Media, was

looked upon as

a great act of courage by. the "underground", and that other groups

the necessary infomation, before actually going through with

the plan.

He questioned the group as to whether on not they

were concerned about the possibilities of an infosmant due to

the size of the group.

They commented that they felt that

there was. an informer within

the group, due to the fact that

the FBI surveilled them in Hi-Nella,

rather than limiting

the size of their group because of the

fear for an informer, they desire to expand the group so chai

it would include more community leaders.

unmarked

He explained that this is the spot that GRADY and

his group will drop a 12-fooï or I4-foot ladder a couple

days before the hit in case they have to work their way

around using the fire escape.

He explained the original

intention was to brace the

fire escave stepsa

They, then

intend to put a ladder against it and the building so that

they can just walk across it rather than pull ine itte

HARDY advised that a little later it was suggested

then intend to so inside the

building and ask the guard if he could somehow get up on

the root so that they can retrieve their basketball.

HAADY stoted the reasoning behind this plan is that the

guard will have to turn or the alarm before

the fire escape

steps can be pulled down.

It was therefore decided thei this

coning sunday night there with be a basketbal gane at about

8 o'clock.

The participants will be GENE DIXON, JOHN GRADI,

in a car sitting on 5th and Cooper Streets on the north

side of Cooper facing down 5th.

He explained that in this

HARDY then related that he and ChADY then went up

to the roof of the Townhouse Apartments.

He explained that

there is a lock on the door but that it can be opened with

nothing more than a plastic chargeplate or credit card.

By using the card it siaply pops the lock.

that one cannot ride the elevator to the oüh floor. In order

mentioned by the name of KEN was at one time a resident of

the Townhouse hpartments.

KEN, at one time, was

approached

by MIKE GIOCONDO to use his apartment on the 5th floor. KN

apparently let GRADY and his group use his apartment on one

occasion; but, later when asked to

join the group, KEN

turned them down cold. HARDY advised he did not know KEN'S

HARDY that the Phila-

delphis contacts have been in touch with cookte while they

were staying at MARTHA SIMLEY's house in Hi-Neila, H.i.,

where they wore staying up until a month ago:

While conversing with GIOCONDO, JOHN GRADY, COOKIE,

and ANTOINEIIE, also known as inite, returned fron shopping.

As they were unloading the groceries he saked cooKis if they

were concerned about the possibility of getting caught doing

their shoplifting.

COOKIE told him

that she. and ANTOINSTID

had gotten clught the other day but there were no problems

since they do not prosecute shoplifters any nore.: COCKIE

explained that when they are caught they are able to talk

their way out of the situation:

Shortly thereafter Father MICHAEL DOYLE came to

the residence.

During the discussion that followed WARDY

learned that Father MICHAEL DOYLE, CINE DIXON, and MARTHA

SHEMLEY were involved in a break-in in the Princeton -

Trenton, N.J., aroa.

He also learned Father MICHAEL DOYLE

had been involved in this type of thing for about six months.

He learned that about a year ago members of the group were

in Philadelphia doing observation work and were asked if

they would consider Canden as a target.

Shortly thereafter

they went to Camden and did some observation work for a few

days and decided that it would be an easy hit. He explained

that it was his impression that this is how the group first

became acquainted with JOHN GRADY.

It was around that time

that GRADY came into the Camden area and was put into touch

with MIKE GIOCONDO and MEL MADDEN, who is the brother of

Father JOE MADDEN, who is a parish priest at Saint Peter

and Paul's Church

in Camden, N.J. MEL MADDEN iS HIKE GIOCONDO g

board hits in the North Jersey ares. .From the conversation

he also learned that MADDEN lives in an apartment house in

oither Union City or Trenton, N. J.

1971, a meeting will be hold at the residence of Doctor

ANDERSON in Collingswood,

time plans will be made with regard to the positions that

the various members will essume on the actual night of the

hit. Plans also called for intense obversations within the

next eigat days from approximately 10:00 p.m., until 3:00

a.m. The purpose of these observations will be to deter

mine infornation with regard to the police patterna and

the patters of the worl crev, and the watchman at the

Post offies

HANDY and one other person will be situated at

the corner of Fourth and Market Streets between Fourth

will bo on the roof of the Iownhouse Apart

ments doing observations fron that position.

Another

car will be stationed at Fifth and Gooper Stroots on the

northwest corner observing Fifth Street and Cooper Street

with regard. to the police and traffic patterns. Plans

also call for a car to be located at Fourth and Cooper

Stroets observing police car patterns in that area.

also call for a person to be located on the roof of the

Parkade Building, observing the traffic and police pat-

terns in the vicinity of City Hall and along Market Street.

At this point it is not determined as to how many people

will actually be involved.

GRADY mentioned that his family would be coming

in on that day by car and that they would got off at

Exit Four on the New Jersey Turnpike and at that point

run a pattern to see if Mrs. GRADY had been followed from

the Bronx.

A car driven by GIOCONDO or DIXON will be

watching Mrs. GRADY to see if she has been followed.

GRADY said that he had a good friend in Rochester,

N.Yo, who is a dentist by the name of Doctor GEORGE MC VEY

who provides money and supports hin at times. According

to GRADY, UC VEY has provided money to GRADY's family for

rent, ete., when GRADY is awv from home.

GRADY bragged

that

his whole fanily was very active and that they can

survive without having to worry a great deal about monoy.

HARDY noted that they had brought in about $40.00

worth of grocaries with a receipt for only $10.00, indicating

that they hao

stolen

about $30.00 worth of groceries.

GRADY

also referred to a hit at Dow Chenical at a logation unlow

to him when some tapes from computers were eresed.

GRADY

in the couniry. GRADY mentioned that this priest was Father

JOHN PEPITRONI.

GRADy mentioned that he would not be involved in

the actual break-in of the Post office but that he wouid

be working fron one of the vantugo points. GRADY has indi

caved vast he woula probably us on the apartmont house roof

or on one

of the lookout cars.

The group uses the pay telephone near Doctor

ANDERSON's house for all incoming calls from CRADI's wife.

GRADY's wife has a couple of phony credit cards that she

Uses in making those telephone calls.

The group is beginning

to feel more secure, however, and they have started calling

in on the doctor's

phone.

It was

HARDY's impression that MICHAEL DOYLE,

JOHN GRADY and most of the people in the group have been

involved in similar activities throughout

• the state.

In referring to slides HARDY mentioned that

GIOCONDO has not been able to locate these slides as yet

but that MARTHA SHIMLEY and GINE DIXON have them somewhere

and that they will soon bring them to Doctor ANDERSON 'g

residence.

HARDY mentioned that the group has possession of

street maps which they use for familiarization with the area.

Sketches have also been drawn with regards to the floor plans

of the Post Offico Building.

The group has diagrams and ex-

tensive notes which thoy make during their nightly surveil-

lances.

They have developed a filing systen that is kept

in a cardboard box. This box is kept in the children's tela-

vision room which is located off the mein dining room.

HARDY learned that GRADi had made severil tele

phone calls to TOPPI SHARP. lie does not at this tine,

however, know the extent of POPPI SHARP's involvement

in this

matter.

No plans bave been made as yet as to what will

be done with the files once they are renoved from the

draft board

GRADY desires to first learn how many 1-A

classificationa there are before meiring this devision.

GRADE desires that about five poople go into the draft

board and that each; will have a shoulder type tote bag

which they could use to carry out files.

Plans call for HARDY to drive his van truok up

the alley so that those who go into the draft board could

come dom I'rom the fire escope and enter his truck for the.

getaway. Plans could also possibly call for him to have

his van parked right below the fire escape. Plans also

call for

a car boing available in case the

police will

come up fourth street.

This car would then swing in front

of the alley, blocking it tenporarily while ther got the

van onto the street and up Fifth Street..

Then they will

probably go south on Cooper Street.

GRADY has indicated that they will use his, HARDY's,

van for the purpose of hauling away the files that are taken

from the draft board.

FEDERAL BURGAU OF INVESTIGATION

Date July 13s 1973

ROBERT WILLIAM HANDY telephonically contacted

SAS NEIST and RYMAN and advised

as follows:

On July 4, 1971, he went to the residence ol

Dr. WILLIAM ANDERSON, Collingswood, N. J., arriving at

7:00 p.M.

No one was

at the residence at that time, and

he later

learned that the reason for this was that Mrs.

GRADY and the GRADY family were late iri arriving from

New York City. It was HARDY's impression that the vehicle

driven from New York by Mrs. GRADY was possibly stolen

because he was asked by GRADY to obtain New Jersey license

plates for the car so that it would not draw suspicion

when in the driveway of Dr. ANDERSON's residence.

After GRADY's arrival a meeting took plice.

Present at the meeting were JOHN GRADY, MIKE GIOCONDO,

COOKE,

MARTHA

SHEMLEY and

• During the

meeting

plans were made with regard to hitting the draft board

located at the Camden Post Office.

The date of the hit was

set for July 18th.

GRADy Indicated that on the night of the

hit he will be located on the roof of the Townhouse Apart

ments from where he will hendle the communications for the

group. GRADY has indicated that two other people (not as

yet designated) will be with him on the roof of the Townhouse

Apartments.

GRADY has indicated to him that at least five

people will be going into the draft board.

GRADY desires that he, HARDY, go to the draft

board on the coming Wednesday afternoon in order to obtain

some idea as to where the l-A draft records are kept.

According to plans, GRADY has designated HARDy to be

the street in nis van,

to act as a pickup unit for the

people who make the hit as they come from the Post Office

into the alley. GRADY has

Indicated that the plans call

for them to carry out as many of the files as they can by

means of knapsacks which they will have on their backs.

GRADY has indicatod to him that he wants to have wallie

talkies for use on the night of the hit and that the group

will gain entry to the draft board by using

* portable

drill to drill through the glass windows of the draft board.

The group left the residence of Dr. ANDERSON at

about 11:30 p.m. and went to thoir different

positions

within the Camden Post Office ares.

It was decided by

GRADX that the hit will be made after nidnight and that

the eroup would consist of at least 18 people.

Upon his arrival ät ANDERSON's residence that

night, HARDY noted that there was a key to i car with a

tag on it.

The license number on this tag was PWF. 936.

There was also a telephone number on this tag, wich was

963-+386.

HARDY also saw a note which was apparently written

COOKIE wherein she had written that on July 2nd three

white males were observed in a green car which passed Dr.

ANDERSON's residence and that the car bore Pennsylvania

license with the first three numbers being "926". At this

point HARDY pointed out that he has learned that COOKIE

sits on the front porch of DE. ANDERSON's residence during

the day and jots down license numbers of any cars which pass

by and appear suspicious to her.

the surveillances which they conducted in the area

of the Camden Post Office were terminated at approximetely

3:45 a.m.

The group left the Camden area in groups of one

or two at a time. COOKIE and ANTOINETTE spent Sunday at

their mothers' homes in South Philadelphia.

ANTOINETTE had

mentioned to him that about a month ago the FBI had visited

both their homes trying to get information from their mothers.

Father MICHAEL DOYLE to be on the street as lookouts and

for HARDY to be in his truck as a lookout.

While on the roof of the Townhouse Apartments

conducting his surveillances with ANTOINeItE, she related

to him that she had gotten involved in this sort of thing

through a friend of hers who was involved in it.

mentioned that she and her friend (whom she did

not identify)

had done observation work in connection with prior hits.

ANTOINETTE mentioned that this friend of hers vas involved

In the East Coast Conspiracy to Save Lives.

She mentioned

that she first became involved beenuse of her friendship with

this person; but, after three or four months of involvement,

she began feeling a need to go further.

She mentioned

• that

if necessary she would go to jail for this cause,

The

surveillances, which are conducted from the rooftop, are

conducted every night until 3:00 a.n. and the purpose of

these surveillances is to determine the patterns of vehicles

and the positions.of people. They make note of the routine

of the guard at the Post Office Building and also of the

police patrol cars.

HARDY related that at the meeting last night the

group sat down with a map and started initiating a detailed

plan as to the various positions, the lookouts, the number

of wakie-talkies, and the number of vehicles, etc.

On that night HARDY parked his van at 12:05 a.m.

at 4th and Market Streets on the northeast corner.

ANTOINETTE was in the van with him observing the police

patterns on Market Street. After he parked the van

he got

out and walked over to 4th and Cooper Stieets in order to

with him at the residence of Dr. ANDERSON, Collingswood, N.J.

CRADY's son is about 10 years of age and is named JOHN.

He has threa younger girls, ages approximately 8, 6 and 5 years.

GRADY mentioned that plans call for the possibliity

of POPPI SHARPE, leader of the Black Peoples Unity Movement,

to have one of his blacks throw a firebomb at the tank

located in front of the Army Reserve Center, Camden, N.J.

This would, according to GRADY,

serve as a good diversionary

tactic drawing police department and fire department units

away from downtown Camden and to the area of the Army Reserve

Center.

The group has expressed concern as to how the FBI

located them in H1-Nella.

They feel, however, that KEN MISNER,

is probably the

person who tipped off the authorities as to

the meetings in Hi-Nella.

GRADY had mentioned that Dr.. MC VEY from Rochester,

N. Y.,

is a supplier of money and a contact for the Rochester,

a slide projector which he had borroved fror a

mutual friend of theirs, a

JOU HENRY, Who Jives on south

5th Street across from the Cooper Hospital.

HENRY used to

•be employed as the station manager for a Carden radio

station.

He has since quit his job and is one of those

"underground characters of the city"'. HARDY made the ob-

servation

that HENRY is not involved in GRADY's grOUp. but

that he merely loaned his projector to GRADY not knowing

what its use was to be.

HARDY related that the group spent about an hour

and a half watching slides and discussing the different rooms

and windows of the Camden: Post Office.

It was at this time

he noted

that the group tas somewhat nervous about the alarm

systen on

the fire escape and the problem of getting from the

roof to the fire escape without setting off the alarm.

DIXON engaged him in a conversation relating to the pronosed

visit by dixon and HARDY to the draft board and that tenta-

tive arrangements were made to meet at the White Tower at

3 p.n. this afternoon.

The plan was then to go to the Post

Office and visit the draft board.

HARDY advised that

of the things that they were instructed to find out while in

the draft board is the

physical geography of the front as far

as the alarm system and

fire escape is concerned. He noted

that GRADY's group is only interested in the lA classifica

tions.

One of the other things that they are to definitely

observe is the location of the watchman's key. HARDY

related that they were instructed to check and see if there

were any alarms on the doors and windows and to checl: the.

name on the filing cabinets so that GRADY could know the type

of lock on

the cabinets.

He noted that there is a nossibility

that GRADY's group could obtain a master key from FIRK, a

fellow in Philadelnhia. They werealso instructed to 1o0l:

for nower sources in case the group that goes into the draft

board deeides to take electric drills.

HARDY advised that his second main objective,

along with DIXON, is to check the second and third floors

that GICCONDO was supposea to take photogranhs fron aton the

Town House Apartnents in order to get shots of various angles

of the Post Office.

HARDY

explained that GIOCONDO is very

adant at using a camera and that he had previously taken shots

of the Camden Post Office from aton the new Rutger's law schoo?

bullding.: WARDY went on to say that prior to arriving at

the Town

House Apartments, he stopped off with Mine Gincondo

Shorty's Newsstand on Collings Rond and it. Binhraim lveme

Canden toolck up sore film for GIeCONDO's camera.

They

then proceeded to the Town House Apartments.

GTOCONDS was

supposed to take his photogranhs at about 5:30 in the

morning.

HARDY advised that while he was on the roof of

the Town House Apartments, ANTOINETTE was supposed to be on

northwest corner of larket and 4th Straets observing

the traffic patterns.

Her exact location was in front of the

little camera shop below 4th on Market.

HARDY

advised that when he arrived at the Town

House Avartments, GRADY and COCKIE were already there and he

noted that GRADY

and COOKIE were having an argument, GRADY

doing all the arguing and COOFIE doing all the listening.

He noted that she was

crying a bit and GIOCONDO went to more

or less interfere.

At this time GRADY told GICCONDO that

it was not his nroblem and that she could handle her own

problems.

he had interfered

once before

between GRADY and

not to interfere.

HARDY

related that while he was with GIOCONDO

en route to the Town House Anartrents, he had learned from

GIOCONDO that GIOCONDO had met two of GRADY's peonle from

the Philadelphia group, but that he only met them by their

firat names.

HARDY learned that these twi peonle are an

white glrls about 22 years old and that they work at the

boolstore in the vicinity of lennle University.

He explained

that the reason the Philadelnhia grou, has not been brogent

into this action is that they are more radical than GRADY and

they dress in a more some a Tetle bit. le enniainea

and that they mlay

around with the drug

that

HARDY explained that another tonic of conversa-

tion with MIXE GIOCONDO was the East Coast Conspiracy to

Save Lives.

He advised that he pressed GIOCONDO for more

Information about this group and the 200 peonte that were

mentioned earlier. GIOCOND answered the question by

stating that he had

nressed ORADY in the early stages of

this thing but that GRADY had always pushed it aside and

nushed GIDeONDo very hard to recruit neocle for this particu-

lar action. HARDY

advised that at the meeting GRADY had

stated to him that he was

involved in the Dow Chemical

action in Michigan.

GRADY did not say what the names were

those involved but steted that it was a sinple oreration.

GRADY stated that the physical plant consisted of

six or

seven buildings and that the entrances were covered

by closedcircuit TV.

GRADY stated that it was guarded by just

one old man who was a watchman and that he had learned that

the closed circuit TV cameras were ineffective within 100

feet of the buildings.

GRADY then stated that it was a

simple matter of conducting their surveillances in broad

daylight next to the buildings. He noted that they just

walked around like they owned the place. GRADY then related

that there were only two men actually involved

in eresing

the computer tapes.

GRADY imnlied that he had inside in-

formation from one of the engineers or scientists who worked

at Dow Chemical because GRADY gave the immression that the

people that actually went in to erase the tapes knew exactly

where the tames were and what the content was on the tanes.

HARDY advised that another toric of conversation

with GRADY was that the Philadalnhia grown is sumorted by

Quakers. GRADY did not say specifically which Quaker groun

it was but that the Philadelphia neople were sunported by

Qualers.

HARDY further advised that GRADY related the

circumstarces of the Bridgeton, M.J., draft board action

which never really got off the ground. GRADY told HARDY

that he came into the thing in the last day of two and that

he didn't like it at all.

GRADY apparently had a personality

bust with a person haned KELLY and GRADY walked away from it.

Consequently.

the action fell apart ana GRADY never

tool: it

seriously. HARDY made the observation that Conte was very

unset and disapnointed with the Bridgeton action.

He asked questions of the draft

board personnel dealing with the procedure for ex-convicts

registering with the draft board upon their release from

prison..

In order

to gain some extra time while in the

draft board office,

HARDY asked for a ley to the men's room

which was supplied to him. He then left the office going

to the men's room, leaving GENE DIXON in the draft board

office. He spent about five minutes in the mon's room

checking the lock system, the physical makeup of the windows,

and noting what could be seen from the men's room window.

When he came back into the hallway, he noted that the

General Services Administration (GSA) guard was getting

ready to make his rounds. He stopped the guard, who remembered

him from his visit of the week before, and talked with the

guard for about five minutes. He obtained quite a bit of

information from the guard during this talk concerning the

physical makeup of the building, the rounds which are made

by the guards, etc. He then walked with the guard to the

Once inside the draft board office, the guard

While inside the draft board

office, he noted that some of

the handles on the windows are broken, makine it impossible

to lock these windows. He later related thas information to

members of the group, The troup was very elated by this

information.

After leaving the draft board office, he and DIXON

went down to the 3rd floor in the arca of the u. s. attorney!s

Office.

There they checked the physical layout of the floor

in relation to the fire escape outside the windows.

They

then stopped in the courtroom and lonked out the windows to

see the maleup of the east wing of the Post Office building.

They also checked the telephone number of the public telephone

located in the hallway.

They then went down to the first

floor and talked to the osh guard about the sign-in system

and how effective this sign-in system was.

to him that very often people walk out without signing out.

The guard said that at about ll p.w. they lock the doors to

the Post Office and at that time check over their list to

The guard mentioned

see who has not signed.out and that if they recognize the

name, they generally just figure that the people had forgotten

co sign out. The guard mentioned that they might make a light

check of the building at this time to insure that no one has

stayed in the building.

It was HARDY's impression from

talking to the guard that' this would not be a very thorough

check of

the building.

HARDY and DIXON then went into the personnel office

of the Post Office and spoke with the personnel manager

concerning the possibility of ex-convicts being hired by

the Post Öffice. The personnel manager was very helpful,

taking them on a tour of the mail room and pointing out the

security system and how postal personnel would be able to

keep an eve on any ex-convicts who might be hired. The

personnel manager took DIXON and him out onto the platform

chance to obtain some first-hand views of the roof over

the platform.

At approximately 4:05 p.m. DIXON and he left the

Post Office and went to DIXON's apartment which is located

at 517 Penn Street. DIXON's upartnent is a third floor

"walk-up",

It is

the only apartment on the third floor.

MARTHk SHEMLEY and COOKIE were at the apartrent when they

It was his impression that they rendezvoused at

about 4:30 p.M. each day so that

DIxon can either eive

MARTHA SHEMLEY a ride to Hi-Nella or give COOKIE a ride

to

He learned from. COOKIE that she and ANITA

have both been in the practice of poing home every night

after they have done their surveillance work on the roof

and that they come back to Conden at about 4:00 p.m. or

5:00 pel.

thing that they had learned while at the Post Office. DIXON

then told him that he could not so to Di. ANDERSON'S

notes to Dr. ANDERSON's home.

At approximately 8:15 p.l., on July 7, 1971,

gotten back to Camden, was up on the roof when the two rirls

arrived there. Upon the girls' arrival on the roof, DiZON

came down from the roof and picked up MARTHA SHEMLEY at the

White Tower and then took her home to Hi-Hella.

HARDY mentioned that GRADY had decided that one

of the things that he would like to have checked would be

to see whether or not the employees of the Post Office

actually sign out when they leave the

Post Office for the

day. GRADY had mentioned to him that it might be possible

HARDY advised that during the meeting there had

GRADY mede mention soveral times during

the meeting last night of the "old actors". It was JOHN

GRADY who mentioned the BACONs and their involvement.

HARDY has learned that the roof at Rutgers 1s no longer.

available to the group because it is completely under lock

and key.

He has also learned that the group has discontinued

using the roof of the Parcal Building for surveillance

because they have found it to be an ineffective surveillance

point. They have noted that only the front of the Post office

can be seen from the roof of the Parcai Building, and they

have also noted that once a person is on the roof at night,

he cannot get down from the roof until 8:00 a.m. when the

Parcai garage opens.

GRADY related to him that he had been involved in

many draft board break-ins

and because of this he felt

that he would get sentenced to 20 years in jali if he were

ever caught.

The target date is still set for a week fron Sunday.

It will take place on a Sunday night after midnight.

Members

of the group have noted a minor problem in that some Puerto

Ricans generally sit on the front step of a building on 4th

Street until about 12:30 a.m. or 1:00 a.m.

From the steps

where they are sitting, they are able to look right down

the Post Office alleyway. Because of this, it was mentioned

that

the

time of the hit will be possibly a little later

than

the time that they had originally planned.

GRADY mentioned POPPI SHARPE during the meeting

last night; and it was apparent to HARDY that GRADY has

been talking extensively with POPPI SHARPE from time to

time.

GRaDe mentioned that POPPI SHARPE's favorite thought was

that arou have to

put the fear back into the man" (merning

the establishment).

GRADY has mentioned how POPPI SHARPE

feels that only when the euthorities fear the people will

they respect them.

HARDY mentioned that GRADY desires that he and

DIXON go into the FBI Office in Canden under suitable pretext

so that they might learn of Information relating to the alarm

and security systems of the FBI Office.

He explained that

they would use

the pretext of trying to learn from the FEI

the procedure used in investigating an ex-convict who applies

job with the

Post Office.

MARTHA SHEMLEY and GENE

also mentioned the prospects of going into the FBI

Office.

As the plans stand now, the draft board is target #1.

Army Intelligence is possibly & second target and, if it 1s

feasible, the FBI Office would be the third

target.

From conversations with the group, HARDY has

learned that COOKIE, ANITA and JOHN GRADY häve been in other

draft boards before when records were destroyed. He mentioned

that GRADY related to him that he was involved in draft board

hits when records were destroyed. From the conversations, it

was also indicated that COOKIE and ANITA were involved in a

draft board hit in Philadelphia.

ANITA and COOKIE,

in order to earn money, have

today gone someplace outside of Trenton, I. i., to rive

lectures concerning drugs.

This lecture is something that

was set up by MEt MADDEN. MEL MADDEN is well aware of what

the group is doing. GRADY will also be going up to give a

lecture at this same group of meetings on Tuesday: and

Wednesday. Apparently, GRADY has given sevaral lactures

for MEL MADDEN in this

area and is paid for those lectures.

The lectures given by GRADY and the girls serve the purpose

of adding funds to their operation. HARDY mentioned that the

group does not really need that much money to live since they

steal most of their food, liquor, milk, bread and clothing.

GRADY has mentioned that previous hits have always

been "Inside Jobs", meaning, that they have been able in one

way or another get members of the eroup inside the terget

area and hide themselves until the time of the hit. This

GRADY feels that entering from the outside increases the

element of risk but that if it could be "pulled off", it

would be a morale boost for the East Coast Conspiracy prouD.

It was mentioned that ANN (last name unknown) from

Philadelphia is picking up COOKIE and ANITA this morning to

take them to North Jersey where they will deliver the

lectures in connection with the drug program. It was mentioned

chat it is about a four-hour drive from Camden and that.

therefore, it would be an all-day affair. It was HARDY's

understanding that the group would be abie, if necessary, to

obtain large sums of money through the East Orange croup.

In referring to previous operations

COOKIE and

ANITA have taken great pride in the fact that they have

always been on the inside, ricking up the draft records.

They mentioned that they were involved in the Philadelphia

hits

and the Trenton hit.. COOKIE and ANITA both said they

were on the inside of the Philadelphie draft board break in

and that they have helped carry the records from

the building

they (COOKIE and ANITA) mentioned that they carried the draft

board records around in the trunk of their car for about a

month before they actually destroyed then. some of the

records mentioned were-ledger books that were used for

cross-reference within the draft board system.

GRADY mentioned that he helped set up a talk by

PHIL Or DAN BERRIGAN at e Germantown (section of Philadelphia)

church last year. GRADY mentioned that one of the BaRRIGiNs

came to the church service on a Sunday morning. HARDY

belleved that it was DAN BERRIGAN he was referring to, but

he was not certain. GRADY mentioned that about three

years

ago he was at a cocktail party with PHIL Or DAN BERRIGAN.

HÄRDY believed that in this instance GRADY was referring

to

PHIL BERRIGAN. At this cocktail party PHIL said to him

(GRADY) and another friend (whose name he did not mention)

that his brother DAN was going to pour blood on some draft

records the next week. GRADY mentioned that he, GRADY,

minded to some say to times

"DAN must be flipping his (obscene

GRADY mentioned later a

nurse came out and extracted blood from the arms of the men

who were going to pour the blood on the records but that the

nurse could not get enough blood out of their arms. Because

of this they went to a butcher shop and bought some duck's

blood and mixed their blood with the duck's blood.

It came

out in the newspapers that it was duck's blood that was

poured over the draft records and that there was no trace

of human blood. When they learned of this, they were very

let down due to the fact that the neuspaper account made no

mention of human blood.

GRADY related this story with first-hand knowledge.

CRADY again emphasized that he has been the key nan in I+

Aw 55302 Dout 99d det Deard hits within the last 2a years.

'GRADY said that he was the one who developed the style

for the break-ins,

GRADY said he is now developing the

style for outside break-ins.

Both GRADY and COOKIE again mentioned the idea

of someone going into the FSI Office at Candon in order to

gain information with regard to the security and alarm syatems.

As the plans now stand, the draft boord is the first tarrot,

Army intelligence is the second target, and the rot ortice,

camden, 11 feasible, would be the third target.

HARDY advised that the plans are kept in a four-inch

the playroom of children's TV room.

Also kept in this box

are slides and a little cardboard filing box in which three-

first time that COOKIE had mentioned the "old actors",

Last night the Issue came up again and

COOKIE said she had to call ANN (last name unknown) in

Philadelphia last night after midnight.

After midnight she

did go to the public phone booth in front of the Canden County

Police Office and made several phone calls. The procedure

in making the calls is for COOKIE to call one number, where

ANN will answer.

ANN will then hang up and go to another

phone booth, which has been predetermined, and COOKIE will

call her there. They do this to insure that ANN is not

being folloved. IN and another girl, whose name was not.

"to check things out."

that he would come down on sunday night at six o'clock,

possibly with one or two of his people, to sit in on a

The target date was set for July 18;

1971 but it was indicated by GRADY that the date might have

During discussion within the group, it was men-

tioned that they would rent a truck. for uss on the hit night.

Plans tentatively call for parling the truck underneath

At this time, plans tentatively ceil

for him, HARDY,

to be in his van at around 4th Street to

He further advised that as roquested to do so

bY GRADY,

he had at 5 o'clock on July 9, 1971, observed

the Postal employees as they leit the Post office building.

GRADY's interest in the depature of the Postal employees

was to determine if every individual was roquired

to sign

out before leaving. On that same afternoon, he saw COOKIS

and ANITA downtown.

During the meeting; it was mentioned that he

and GaNE DIXON should go to the FBI Office in Canden, N. I..

at about 3 p.m. on the coming Wednesday, for the

purpose

of developing information with regard to the alarm and

security setup of the office. The pretext to be used in

gaining entry to the office is that they ara working with

a program concerned with obtaining employment for ex-convicts.

ex-convicts who apply for a job with the Post Office.

GENE DIXON and JOHN GRADY are the members of the group who

have come up with the idea of checking out the FBI Office.

It was mentioned during the meeting that the set

of locks and tools

have been brought to the residenca of

DI. ANDERSON so that members of the group can practice with

them there.

Before being brought to Dr. ANDERSON's, part

of the tools were at GINS DIXON's apartment and part of the

tools were at MARTHA SHEMLaY's apartment.

He also learned

that KIRK, the Philadelphia locksmith, also drives a taxi

cab and is serving his apprenticeship as a locksmith.

He

has taught the group how to open file cabinets without going

through a great deal of trouble.

ROVERT WILLIAM HANDY furnished the following

infornation:

HARDY advised that at approximately & p.m., on

July 11, 1071, MIKE

GIOCONDO stopped at hie residence, picked

him up

and took him to Dr. WILLIAM ANDERSON's house in Collings-

wood; N. J.

HARDY stated that prion to leaving for Dr. ANDERSON's

house he talked with MIXE GIOCONDO for approximatoly one half

hour.

The topic of conversation was the forthcowing action at

the Canden Draft Board.

GIOCONDO then advised HARDi, which was

a revelation to him, that GIOCONDO, after leaving the hospital

with a previous heart condition, started to

see. a psychiatrist

"on a regular basis.

GIOCONDO stated to HARDY that again he was

not at all sure that he should be in this "thing," bụt that

he is now in it and will continue through.

HARDY advised when he arrived at Dr. ANDERSON'S

house there were two new people present. These two new people

were MEL MADDEN,

the brother of the priest at SS. Peter and Paul,

Canden, N. J. MADDEN is the hoad of the state drug program for.

the State of New Jersey and MIKE GIOCONDO works for him. The

other individual was a white male named TERRY (last name unknown).

He described TERRY as 5'6", 160 pounds, age about 28, medium build,

with a vandyke type beard, black bush hair--alnost afro-style.

"It

was later brought out that he is married to a black woman,

Also

present at the meeting were JOHN. GRADY, COOKIE, ANITA, JEAN DIXON,

and MARTHA SHEMELEY. He advised MADDEN and TERRY live in Northern:

New Jersey.

HARDY advised in the course of the conversation MEL

MADDEN stated he would. provide a van and some people and would

try to get some money from the Defense Connittee.

MADDEN brought

up that there is always the possibility of one of the group

"participating in the action" could possibly be picked up and

that bail, noney would be necessary.

and said that someone by the name of YEAGER would be a financial

touch for this thing. YEAGER is a member of the Scranton Defense

Committee.

The conclusion was reached that YEAGER, TERRY, and

TERRY's brother, name unknowns and MEL MADDEN would provide

another van, some people, and some money for the forthconing

Canden action.

HARDY advised next Sunday night, July 18, 1971,

the group

the group. will have a dry-run so there will be trucks in the

area and people participating in this dry-run.

The plan is

attach an experienced person to one of the newcomers and

familiarize the newconers with the area in and around the

Camden Post Office, which will be assigned to that person

for

the evening of the

hit. The consersus of opinion is that 18

people will be needed to carry out the action successfully.

HARDY advised that POPPI SHARPE had been contacted

apparently by GRADY during

the past week and that he has committed

eight people for the exterior defense on the night of the action.

SHARPE'S PARBLe are to create

some kind of a problem if it is

needed.

explained this would be sonc sort of diversionary

tactic to call attention away from the post office. Nothing

more was said about the napalming of the army tank in front

of the Reserve Center in Canden, although it had been referred

to during the course of the discussion some half a dozen times.

HARDY advised another name was brought up. This

person might possibly becone involved in the action and from

GRADY's comment this person has experience and has participated

in past actions. GRADY mentioned the name BUSBUY of BUZZARD.

HARDY advised

I GRADY did not go into detail regarding BUSBUY.

HARDY advised next Sunday: July 19, 1971, at 6 p.m.,

MEL MADDEN and TERRy, along with those people they will be able

to bring, will report to the ANDERSONs' home for a briefing anc

will

then be paired off with some of the people who are

already

involved in the Canden action.

The tentative "hit time" is going

to be between 11:30 p.m., and 12:30 a.m.

As yet GRADY and his

group have not set the time for sure.

HARDY advised while

participating with the group in the surveillance last night the

group could. have gone in at 11:30 p.n., and 12:30 a.m.

explained the surveillance workings as follows:

The surveillance commenced at 11:30 p.M.,. with everyone

in the pre-arranged checkpoints. Observations were made for a

NW 55302 DocId: 32989694

## Page 338

PH

52-7165 SUB S

full ten minutes and then at 11:40 p.n., observations were again

inade as

if 11:30 did not happen.

These

are carried out

every

ton minutes until approximately 12:20 &.h.

This infornation which

is compiled by each

nonber of the surveillance is then discussed

the next evening and each person at the prescribad times states

what was seen

Fon exanple, there was a patrol car on Market

Street at 11:30 p.m., so that would knock out the 1l:30

to

11:40 time frame.

Another example given by HARDY

was that at

11:50 p.m., the watchman looked out the bathroom window.

HARDY

explained these observations had been gone over

in great detail;

the general consensus for last night was that

the group could have gone in at three different times without

any problems.

HARDY made the observation that it is no wonder these

people have been very successful in their attempts to hit draft

boards. He observed that the more exparienced they get the more

proficient they

become and new ideas and

innovations are arrived

at.

HARDY stated that GRADY mentioned the Wilmington, Del.,

draft board break-in in the context that he was showing MEL

MADDEN and TERRY that he and his group had gone to some extremes

to make this action successful's GRADY related in the men's room

in the building where the draft board is located there is a sus-

pended ceiling:

GRADY related sone of his group lifted the

panels out and slung hammocks in the ceiling. On the night of

the action four men went into the men's room and hung in the

hannocks for about six hours. Then, after closing hours, it was

just a matter of dropping through the ceiling and then proceeding

to the draft board. :

GRADY related that TONY SCOBLICK was the

person who actually picked up the people who were inside the

building in a van.

The people knew they had until 4:45 in the

morning to do their job on the draft board because from previous

surveillances GRADY knew that the State Police only checked the

building at 4:35 a.m.

GRADY went on to say that the group inside

the draft board was originally supposed to come out the front door

and that they put plywood panels against the glass in the front

door so no one could see in the draft board offices.

He went on

to say after closing hours one of the persons inside had a power

drill

and was attempting to drill the lock out but that he had a

bad bit, so this person went to the back door and just popped it

oper and then the van pulled up from around back and everyone who

in the draft board got into the van and drove away; GRADY

mentioned PAUL COUMING

as a participant in the Wilmington, Del.,

Draft Board. break-in.

ons or two of them could "take a shot" at the Army intelli-

gence Office of oven the FBI Offico.

The group is now consivering a Saturday night

as well as Sunday night as the possible night for the

hit.

The reason for this is that from their surveillance,

ithey have found that the various pattern. on Saturdays

would possibly be more conducive for a successful hit than

those on Sundays. It was mentioned that DIXON's apartment

would be used as aleeping quartors for some of the

"o1d

who would be coming in for the hit.

flat on Broadway and Koyden, above his offico, and mike

for those:

"old actors"

who would be coming in for the hit.

ROBERT WILLIAM HARDY telephonically contacted Special

Agents TERRENCE P. NEIST and MICHAEL M. RYMAN and advised as

follows:

On July 19, 1971, he picked up MIKE GIOCONDO at

approximately 8:30 p.m. in front of the Walt Whitman Hotel

in Canden, N.

J. They then went to the residence of Doctor

ANDERSON, Harding Avenue and South Park Drive, Collingswood,

N. J., arriving at approximately 8:45 p.m. Upon arrival he

noted that those present at the ANDERSON residence were MARTHA

SHEMELEY, GENE DIXON, COOKIE, ANITA, JOHN GRADY, GRADY's family:

and BOB GOOD.

All members of the group were in good spirits

due to the fact that they felt that the Sunday night surveil-

lance had gone exceptionally well.

At abotit 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.M. all members of the

group went into the basement of the residence where the maps

and drawings are kept on the ping-pong table.

It was at about

that time that Doctor ANDERSON came to the residence.. He had

something to eat and after that joined the rest of the group

in the basement.

JOHN GRADY has devised a plan that calls for several

cars to block key intersections at the time of the hit to

insure that the hit team has sufficient time to go unnoticed

from the alley to the roof of the Post Office Building.

BOB GOOD mentioned that RO RO. is. ROSEMARIE RILEY

(phonetic). GOOD also mentioned that he is leaving for New

York on Tuesday morning and will spent a couple of days there

contacting others who are experienced in actions of this type.

GOOD mentioned that he did not feel that it would be any trouble

to get additional "old actors" to come down for the hit.

It was mentioned that SENE DIXON has taken a week

ofi from his job in order to do some daytime

surveillance

work in Camden. It was his (HARDY ) impression, from what

was

said, that

DIXON would possibly be coming back into the

Post Office Building to look around a bit more.

It was also

mentioned that possibly one. person would go into the Post

Office Building the day before the hit and stay there until

the hit took place.. JOHN GRADY mentioned that he liked the

idea of someone spending the night prior to the hit in the

Post Office Building:

Last night the group started dry runs with regard to

the working out of the signals that will be used enabling the

person

on the

of the Towne louse Apartments to know whether

or. not Cooper

front of the drugstore, to make the determination as to whether.

or not Market Street is clear of police patrol cars. When he

has determined that Market Street is clear he will walk caddy-

corner fron the drugstore to the White Tower Restaurant (located

at Fifth and Market Streets). A person who will be at Fifth and

Penn Streets will be able to observe

the person at Fifth and

Market streets

as he crosses

the street.

The person at Fifth

and "Penn"

Streets will be equipped with binoculars and. a walkie-

talkie. The person at Fifth and Penn Streets will, upon

notividuals

noting the individual cross the street, signal by radio to the

individuals on the roof of the Towne House Apartments.

At the

same time those. on the lowne House Apartment roof will have

Cooper Street under surveillance.

A third point which the

group will have to insure is clear is Fourth Street. They will

have

should not take more than five

seconds.

man or woman on the roof (who is

in charge of communications)

will send a signal down to the alley for the team to come out of

The group feels that they would need a full minute of

protection in order

to insure safe passage from

the alleyway to

the roof of the Post Office Building. Plans call for a sufficient

number of cars to be on the street in order to block the inter-

sections

the

cars will block the traffic flow by stopping their cars

and talking from one car to another as if obtaining street

directions.

If the police approach them they will wait in

the cars until the police come to them to attempt to move them.

HARDY stayed at the neeting until about 11:15 p.m.

at which time he left.

Plans currently call for a walkie-talkie to be with

someone in the alley.

GRADY has mentioned that he wants two

more walkie-talkies

which would be of a better quality than

those which they have already obtained.

He desires

this so

that the person on the roof of the Towne louse Apartments can

receive the transmissions from the person at the fifth and Penn

Streets corner.

During the radio check it had been determined

that there was quite a bit of interference due to the buildings

which came between the rooftop and the person on the street.

GRADY mentioned again last night that the hit would

have to take place before August ist since Doctor ANDERSON's

family was returning to the residence on that date.

GRADY also

mentioned that the hit would take place well in advance of

August Ist, and

that August lst was the "outside date.".

It it is determined that a person will be sent inside

the building on the day before the hit, it will be necessary

for the hit to take place on Saturday night. This is due to the

fact that it is

i ename of the tea in or age the or i so 44 tig.

on the day prior to the hit this person would so to the fifth

floor and step out the hallway window and go around to the

Fourth Street side of the fifth street roof. There is a six

loot wall which goes all the

way around the

top of the fifth

Floor.

There are no windows on

that side.

It is his impression

that either COOKTE or ANITA would be the individual who would go

into the building on the day before the hit lif it is determined

that this should be done.

Members of the group were saying on sunday night that

all unnecessary chatter should be eliminated while they were

working on the plans and

that nothing regarding the plans should

be mentioned to anyone outside the group.

ROBERT WILLIAM HARDY was interviewed and advised

as follows:

lle would present the present plans for the Canden

"Draft Board action" as told to him on July 19, 191e, at

Doctor ANDERSON's residence, Collingswood, i. J., by JOHN

GRADY, ANITA, and COOKIE.

The pian involves about 22 people, approximately 10

automobiles, and

I walkie-talkies (which are referred to as

"headsets" by members of the group).

The plan is initially

concentrated on three points:

The first key point is the

"number two position"

Townhouse Apartment roof.

There

will be four people on theroot of the Townhouse Apartments.

One will be at the rear of the building

looking toward the

alley behind the Post Office Building. The "number two posi

tion" is the key position of the entire operation.

in the number two position will be the individual who river the

signal to start or stop the operation depending on the situation

as seen by the lookout.

The "number three" and "number four"

positions are "lookouts" who will be on the Townhouse Apartment

roof looking east and west on. Cooper Street. These individuals

will be within walking distance of the number two position.

Plans call for JOHN GRADY to have the number two or key posi

tion.

A second key position is an automobile which will be

parked by the Ben Franklin Bridge on Fifth Street in the vici-

nity of Fifth and Penn, Streets.

The individual in this vehicle

will have a direct view of the third key position which will be

a person standing on the southwest corner of Fifth and Market

Streets, directly opposite the White Tower Restaurant.

There will be two cars on Fifth Street at Market.

When the individual located on the southwest corner

of Fifth and Market Streets (who is referred to as key posi-

tion nunber three) steps from the corner and walks diagonally

across the street to the White

by the man in the vehicle who is in the vicinity of Fifth and

The man on Fifth and Market Streets will cross

the street to the White lower as so indicated when he has

determined that Macket Street and Fifth Street are clear of

any police cars.

There will be two individuals in the car located at

Fifth

and. Penn Streets. When the individuals in the car ob

serve the man to cross the street, they will say "go" over the

walkie-talkie.

This will be received by JOHN GRADY, the "key

which will take place on the night of the action.

in the van which will be parked

in the alley behind the Post Office Building will also have a

walkie-talkie. This individual will be able to hear the signals

of both the lookout at fifth and lenn streets and GRADY.

the man in the van with the walkie-talkie hears the second "go"

the back. doons of the van will open up and those in the van will

exit from it carrying with them a nine foot ladder.

This ladder

wiii be placed against the overhanging roof on the platform

behind the Post Office.

The "hit team" will then go on to the

100 F

of the platform from the side position. They will be

entering the roof from the fifth Street side of the roof.

There will be six people who will be going into the building.

These individuals, will go up the ladder and the first man up

will turn around and pull un an additional nine foot ladder

which he will place against the wall from the platform roof

to the second floor roof: le will proceed to go up the ladder

followed by the others.

When the last individual goes up the

Ladder onto the platiorn roof the individual who remains with

the van vill take

the ladder down and put in in the van. He

will then either lock the van and walk away from the

area or

he will drive away in the van.

At this point it would appear

most

likely that he would lock the van and walk away from it.

As the last man goes over the second floor roof le

will. pull

the ladder up behind lin so that it will not le

visible. They have determined

that they need about sixty

seconds to get the people from

the van onto the roof.

While menerd of the "hit team" are going up the

Ladder the cars if need be, will

start moving down Market

Street, down Fifth Street, across from Fourth and Cooper Streets,

across

from Fourth and Market Streets so that they will effectively

block off all entrances so that no one can see the var.

Two cars will be parked by the White Tower Restaurant,

Fifth and Market Streets, waiting for the light on Market Street.

Two cars will be parked on either side of the street on Fifth

Street pulling out after the man (Fifth and Market

Streets)

gets halfway across the street.

In other words this gives the

man at the key position located at Fifth and Penn Streets clear

vision of the man crossing the street.

The two cars on Fifth. Street will then pull out so

ayproach.

There will

also

be another car between Market

If the neca

arises those individuals in these cars

will drive around the block in order to give the hit team the

necessary protection in order to get into the building. If

necessary these vehicles will block the corners of Fourth and

Cooper Streets,

Markley Alley, the corner of Fourth and Market

Streets, and if necessary the

corner of Fifth and Market Streets

All of this will take place within a time span of sixty seconds.

There will also be a group of "out riders," that is

other cars which will be in the area at a distance further away

fron the

Post Office Building. At this point there has

only

been one "out rider" that has

been designated and that is one

that will be at third and Federal Streets facing east.

It has

not as yet been determined what the function of this individual

in this car will be.

The general thought of the group with regard to the

plans would be that if something happens after the

second "go"

the cars will return to their original positions.

During the surveillances the

group makes notations for each

ten-minute interval; for instance,

from 11:50 to 12 o'clock midnight.

They are attempting to learn

of a thirty-minute time frame wherein the traffic and police

patterns would be suitable for their gaining entry to the building.

They then plan to take the ten minutes fron the middle of this

thirty-minute frame and use this ten-minute frame for the hit..

The driver of the van after locking the van (after the

hit team has entered the building) would walk away to a pre-

determined position which would nost likely be the churchyard

behind

the chuoch located at Tiith and Cooper Streets.

In order for the operation to be initiated,. the con-

ditions at the three key points have to be met.

That is, the

man at Fifth and Market Streets after observing that all was

The two "go" signals should be heard

within a five to ten second

interval. If a second "go"

signal is not given the vehicles will return to their original

positions and wait another ten minutes in order to set every-

thing up again. Tor instance, if it is originally planned to

initiate the action at 11:50 but the second "eo" signal is not

received, everyone will return to their original positions and

wait until 12 o'clock midnight.

At 12 o'clock midnight then

the man on Fifth and Market Streets would make his determina-

tion as to whether the area is clear or not clear

and he would

again step off and cross the street and thereby initiating the

cycle.

The critical man is the man at the corner of Fifth

and Market Streets.

If he does not step off trom the corner

nothing is initiated.

Other than GRADY, it has not been firmly set up as

to what individuals will be in what position.

however, that COOKIE and ANITA will be part of the team that

back packs with possibly forty to fifty pounds of files that

it will take longer for them to exit than it did

is anticipated that the hit team will

This millionaire was

in jail for some sort of stock manipulations and while in jail

BERRIGAN was successful in making this man a believer within

This millionaire supported GRADY when he

(the

amount of money. on a weekly ormmonthly period.

This man's

GRADY mentioned that this man, upon his

release from jail, did not have as much monev as he did when

he was first imprisoned.

•GRADY has been instrunental in ob-

taining employment for

from royalties received from BERRIGAN's boOK. GRADY indicated

this was how he and his family had been able to live over the

last two years during which time GRADY had never worked other

than giving some lectures in connection with the drug program.

GRADY indicated that knowing

how to obtain infornation thusly

they had used walkié-talkies.

in the door or to drill the lock out of the door in order to

gain exit throuch the front door. When they were not able to

do this the ider was panced between GRADY and those on the

inside oy

walkie-talkie that they should go around the rear

exit of the building.

GRADY mentioned that he listened over the

walkie-talkie as they went through the building and that he

heard a loud sound that sounded much like

a shot. On hearing

this GRADY issumed that the

"inside team" had kicked the glass

out of the back

door because they were unable to get it unlocked.

At this point he decided to go to the rear of the building in

order to pick them up. In their haste to do this SCOBLICK

broke off the antenna without realizing that he had done so.

He broke the

antenna either when he wound up the window or when

he pulled it in.

They were then puzzled as to why they could

not get a rending, on the inside activity and it was ten minutes

before they discovered that the antenna was broken.

GENE: DIXON has recently mentioned again that he

desired to go into the FBI Office in Camden to learn informa-

tion reparding the security of the office..

IF DIXON were to do

so he would

use the pretext of working with the ex-convict

program.

COOKIE and ANITA also wanted to know more about the

FBI Office

because they feel that if they can be successful n

nitting the draft board they can also be successful in hittin

the Army Intelligence Office on

the fourth floor of the Post

Office Building and the FBI Office on the second

floor.

They

feel that they could

enter the fbl Office by sawing the door

in half or by cutting a panel out of the door which is what

they had done in the draft board action at Broad Street in.

Philadelphia.

HARDY related that at one time in the past he had

mentioned that GENE DIXON had talked to soncone

whon he had met

in Harrisburg.

He has recently learned that this individual

was PAUL, COUMING. DIXON in relating the story to him said that

into COUMING on the Post Office uteps.

COUMING asked' DIXON if

he knew anyone who was

"not so non-violent." It was DIXON's

impression in other words that COUMING was looking for someone

who would be capable of performing violent acts.

DIXON had

suggested to him (HARDY. ) that COUMING could possibly use some-

one

like him.

He

has also learned that (firat name unknown) FRANCIS,

whose car tas been used by GRADY on many nights in the past,

was in an

There was discussion among members of the group

concerning the fact that GENE DIXON had not shown up this

DIXON had taken the week off from work in order to

that DIXON had not perforned his duties with regard to the

GRADY gave him (HARDY) $150 and told him to buy

some walkie-talkies.

After the discussion concerning DIXON, JOHN GRADY

mentioned that this would no longer be a "Canden action"

because he (HARDY) was the last person

definitely have to bring in outsiders to perform the hit.

camping:

While talking last night with GRADY and Doctor

ANDERSON, DOctor ANDERSON asked GRADY what he (GRADY) would

be doing after this action and to where he would be

going.

GRADY roplied that he did not know and that he had "no plans

at all."

GRADY said that it was just a matter of knowing

adjust to his environment at the moment. GRADY said

that he had been living on a day-to-day basis for the last

year and

that it is hard for hin to make plans from one week

to the next.

COOKIE and ANITA seemed very pleased that things •

are coming to an end and fael cartain that the action will

"come off."

He, (HARDY), stayed at the ANDERSON residence until

about 12:30 a.m.

When he said good night to the group, GRADY

said that he would be going to the law School Building to do

some observation work by himself.

GRADY walked with him about

one-half way to where his (HARDY's)

car was parked and while

doing

so, told him that he would raally like to have him think

about becoming more involved in this type of thing.

GRADY told

him that ha had the type of talent that was needed in the under

ground.

This morning he went to the ANDERSON residence at

about 0:15 a.m., and spoke with GRADY for about ten minutes.

GRADY, at this time, again mentioned that he really needed

someone like him in his organisation.

with the proposed action.

HARDY

advised that the name (FNU) H00D has been

The survelllance plan as of last night was for

rather MICHAEL DOYLE, MIKE GIOCONDO, JOHN GRADY, and ANITA,

to go to the roof of

new Rutgers Law School Building

with one "headset."

The plans called for COOKIE to go to

che rooi of the Townhouse Apariments with one "headser

and for HARDY

to drive around the city and conduct par..

checks from various points so that the group could determine

the range of the walkie-talkies and alsd what type of intei-

ference would be encountered.

During the discussions, a telephone call was received

Exon BOB GOOD, who was in New York City, GRADY explained the

procedure by which GOOD makes his telephone calls.

GRADY eX-

plained that GOOD will call GRADY using a

fictitious name.

This alerts GRADY to the fact that the call is

from BOB GOOD.

GRADY will then reply to the operator that the person who has

been asked for is not there.

GRADY will then go to the pay

• phone, locaced in front of the Camden County Park Police

Headquarters: and make a station-to-station call to BOB GOOD.

GRADY told the group

that the message from GOOD

was that ANNE and MUrPH would be down tonight to look over

the scene and to see what they could add to the plan.

GRADY

also mentioned that GOOD had advised him that ED MC GOWAN

was in Toronto, Canada, and was not available at the moment:

It was also mentioned that ROSEMARY REILLY, alSO Known as

nu no, was in Burialo, N.Y., at the time and that they were

not sure as to her availability for the action.

During the surveillance, the group spent their

time in going over the foux check

points and the positions

where

various people would be and

what the jobs of the people

would be.

He (HARDY)

started at Fifth and Pearl Streets

(by the bridge) and conducted a radio check wich the people

on the roof of the law school and those on the roof of the

Townhouse Apartments.

He then went to Broadway and Market

and parked on the corner by hit Brothers to conduct a visual

contact.

He explained that this position is one of the key

points at the moment. HARDY's

third check point was Third

and Federal Streets, where he parked on the corner and checked

transmission over the "headsets."

The fourth check point was

NW 55302 DocId: 32989694

PH 52 - 7165 SUB S

on Fourth Street, north of the underpass. Good radio reception

was received at three of the check points. At the fourth check

point there was a little bit of static.

Members of the group

compiled notes as to the radio reception received from the various

check points.

During discussions last night, GRADY said that the

group was not ready for the action as yet. ANITA concurred

in this opinion. GRADY said that things

were "just not tight

enough."

During the middle of maxt week, GRADY's family is

Leaving the ANDERSON home and going to a camping site in the

Wildwood Crest or the Cape May Courthouse area (New Jersey).

Doctor ANDERSON's family will be coming back into town next

Saturday.

He- (HARDY): left the surveillance area at approximately

4:00 a,m,, after completing the last radio check.

COOKIE,

Father MICHAEL DOYLE, MIKE GIOCONDO and JOHN GRADY intended

to stay on the Law School Building until at least 6:00 a.m.

At about that time they walkad the streets and tried to determine

ways of going in and out of the building.

GRADY has mentioned that when the action takes placa

it will be on a Saturday or Sunday night.

Last night GRADY

said that they will need twelve cars, six with drivers and

six parked.

GRADY told

members of the group last night that

they should start thinking about where they could get extra

cax's.

GRADY indicated that these cars would ba used to

effectively block off different area, if need be.

The group has a list of unmarked cars that have been

in the area during their nightly surveillances. They are attempt-

ing to determine who the regular occupants of

these

vehicles are

by "just driving around" and looking into the White Towar Rest-

aurant and the various other spots where plain-clothed detectives

would normally make their stops.

HARDY then advised that the following vehicles have

GIOCONDO gave a clear signal at 12:15 a.m.

At that

time HARDY opened the trunk of his car. (MURPHY was standing

at the telephone booth located directly across from the City

Hall parking lot, by. Kenny's Restaurant. MURPHY noted the

activities from that positions)

The plans call for MURPHY,: 1f

he saw anyone hurrying out of City Hall, to bend over and tie

his shoe.

This could be seen by. HARDY

at. Broad and Market

Streets, Plans called for HARDY, upon seeing this, to close

the trunk to his car. This would serve to advise GRADY that

there was some action on Broadway or that something was wrong:

MIKE DOYLE was parked on the corner at Fourth and Market

Streets.

Although no one was at Fourth and Federal Straets

during last night's surveillance, the plans call. for someone

to be. in that position.

Plans also call for someone to.be at Fourth and

Marklay Avenue.

The van will be parked by the Post Office plateorm

with six people inside the van.

Plans, at this point, call

for HARDY

to be driving the van on the night of the

action.

On conducting "dry runs" members of the group

exchange positions so that each will have the feel of the

positions handled by the others.

When everything is clear, the signal will come

down

from the roof of the Townhouse Apartments to the man

driving the van, indicating that all is clear.

Also, a

signal will come

Irom the person at lourth and marklay to

someone who will be looking out the window of the

van.

The person in the van with the "headset" will get the signal

from GRADY while a signal

transmission will be

heard from

GIOCONDO tO COOKIE as . "Go!"

The two people on the Townhouse Apartment roof

will be viewing Cooper Street.

When all these conditions

are clear, and say

"Go" at 12:15 a.m., the group will know

that they have the two minutes to get the people on the

POOf.

Meanwhile, if there is some problem, they will

still have paople in cars who can block Markley Street,

Fourth Street, and Cooper Street.

Plans now call for the action to take place on

a Saturday night between 13:30 p.m.

and 12:15 a.m., (Sunday

morning).

GRADY feels that the police activity at this time

would be the minimum, due to the changing of the shifts.

During

last night's surveillance, they went through

four different times, starting at 12:15; 12:20, 12:25, and

12:30.

They noted that at each time they would have had the

necessary two minutes to get the group into the building.

They noted, in fact, that they would have had a complete

twenty minutes, if necessary.

BOB GOOD mentioned last night that he would be

going to New York City on Tuesday or Wednesday to talk to

some moxe people.

Apparently, COOKIE has been contacting some more

people in Philadelphia.

GRADY now feels

that he has better control of the

situation from the roof of the new Rutgers Law School Building.

GRADY has noted that from that position, he can see Broadway

and Market Streets, the Post Office alley, the van, the Town-.

house Apartments,

and the Fourth Street underpass.

NED MURPHY and ANN DUNHAM will be going back to

New York tonight.

It was HARDY's impression that MURPHY and DUNHAM

were very impressed and that they would probably be bringing

sompone back with them when they would return from New York.

MURPHY mantioned the name of JOE O'ROURKE fron the

New York area. MURPHY mentioned that, either in the context,.

O'ROURKE was involved in the "New York Right" action or the

"Harrisburg Conspiracy" trial action..

HARDY left the surveillance at approximately 1:15

a.M.

It was his understanding that the rest of the group would

remain until six in the morning.

MURPHY also mentioned that if the group was inside

the building long enough that it would be no trouble to take

a look at the Army Intelligence Office and the FBI Office.

MURPHY mentioned that it was very unusual fos an Army Intelligence

Office to be in an area of this type, and that because of this,

he felt that there must be some important records in that office.

HARDY

went over the positions of various members

of the group during the surveillance of last night. COOKIE

and ANN DUNHAM were on the Townhouse Apartment roof; GIOCONDO

was in a vehicle on Fourth Street at the underpass on the

North Canden side of the bridge; ANITA and GRADY were on the

Law School roof; BOB GOOD was at Fourth Street and Marklay

Alley; MIKE DOYLE was at Fourth. and Macket, parked on the

corner so that he had a good view of Market Street and Fourth

Street.

MURPHY was in the telephone booth directly across

from City Hall. 'He (HARDY)

was at Broadway and Market Streets

by the corner of Lit Brothers. He

stayed there for twenty

minutes and at every five minute intervalhe would open his

trunk for a few minutes.

It was mentioned last night that a woman who was

the head of the Illinois Nursing Association, who was the

person who ran the Dow Chemical action.

It was mentioned

that she was the key person in this action.

It was also

indicated that she is unmarried and about 45 years old.

All

membars of the group spoke of her with admiration.

(HARDY)

did not racall her name but feels

He

that he would be

able to recognine the name if he heard it.

The plans currently call for six cars noving and

six carg parked on the night of the action.

All of these

vehicles will be coming from the general area of ANDERSON's

residence.

Some of the

cars will be coming fron Philadelphia.

The cars coning fron Philadelphia would be the cars

that were

obtained by COOKIE and ANITA from the list of names they have

concerning Philadalphia people.

Most of the cars would come into Cauden fron Route

130 on the Admiral Wilson Boulevard, taking either the Seạrg

and Roebuck tum-off or going to Seventh and Linden, where

thay would make. a left tum and come down to either Cooper

on Market Streets... The cars will nove at a predesignated

he noted that thosa present were BOB GOOD, ANITA, and

COOKIE. JOHN GRADY and Mrs. GRADY were still at

the shore.

Members of the group sat down with their street

maps and started to lay out their plans for the surveillance

of that night.

It was mentioned that JOHN GRADY was due back to

the ANDERSON residance by 9:00 that evening.

At 11:00 p.M.,

when GRADY had still not recurned

the members of the group

decided to go into Camden for their surveillance work.

BOB GOOD, during the meeting, mentioned that he

would spend another month in Camden because

"things that

he had going for him in New York City are still in che

talk stage.

GOOD offered to take him (HARDY) to New York

City fox a couple of days the next. time that he went

these.

COOKIE commented that during the two years that

she has known GRADY, that this is the most "strung-out,"

tired, irritable, and short tempered, that she has ever

seen him. COOKIE said that she has never seen GRADY at

such a low point. COOKIE felt that this was due to the

heavy effects of

the surveillances, of casings; the lact

that he has had to spend much time

away fron his family;

and other factors. COOKIE felt that another reason for

GRADY's low morale was the fact that he has not been getting

any real physical help from the Defense Committee: in New.

York City.

GRADY was going to the shore yesterday with his

wife because he had to go to Capa May, N.J., for a lecture

which he would deliver in connection with MEL MADDEN'S Drug

Program.

GRADY and his wife intended to look at the camp

sites, after GRADY's lecture, and then go to Doctor ANDERSON's

summer home in Sea Isle City, where they

would have dinner

and drinks with Dootor and Mrs. ANDERSON.

That night, upon leaving for the surveillance in

Canden ,

the group left BOB GOOD at the ANDERSON residence

so that he could take care of the GRADY children, who were

there, and also so that GOlD could get a good night's sleep

since

he was leaving early in the morning for New York City.

He (HARDY!, ANITA, and COOKIE left in his truck.

They stopped by the new Rutgers Law School Building where

ANITA exited the truck in. order to enter the law School Build-

ing. After ANITA was safely inside of

the Law School Build

ing, cookIE and he went to the South side of Macket Street,

in front of the little Bazaar, located across from the Post

Office Building

in Canden.

COOKIE remained in the truck to

do her observation work from the front

building,

then proceeded to walk down Fifth Street, north

of Cooper Street to Fourth Streat and back down Fourth Streat,

where he sat on a step opposite Fourth Street and Markley

Avanue. • He observed the Post Office fron that point.

He stayed

there until 12:40 a.m., at which time he returnedto his truck,

where COOKIE had been

sitting.

The two of them drove around in his truck, checking

out the police garage behind sears, and counting the black anc

white cars, as well as the

unmarked cars. They then ratumec

to the area of the Post Office and went to the City Hall Parking

Lot, which is referred to by the group as "garden").

While by the City Hall Parking Lot, thay counted

the rest of the

patrol cars (black and white cars). After

counting the marked cars at the two locations, they were

able to account for all of the patrol cars, except for

three, during the evening.

They felt that

they knew where

twenty-two of the police cars where.

They then went to the

gasoline station located

at Seventh and Cooper Streets, where COOKIE picked up some

They then went to friends Avenue, where he

dropped die cookiE so that she could so to the roof of the

Townhouse Apartments, (referred to by the group as Filmore).

COOKIE Gent to the rooftop at approximately 1:30

a.m., at which time he left the area. The plan was for

COOKIE and ANITA to stay on the rooftops, making radio con-

tacks with each other and observing the buildings until

4:00 a.m., at which time they would both leave the ared.

HARDY mentioned that ANITA now returns home many

nights during

the week, while COOKIE spends the night either

at GENE DIXON's apartment (517 Penn Street, Camden, N.".) OT

at MIKE GIOCONDO's apartment (Third and Cooper Streets,

Canden,

N.J.). Sometimes COOKIE spends the night in Philadelphia, at

a place unknown to him. COOKIE has said to him that she does

not go home at night.

During the course of the surveillance last night,

it was mentioned that ANN DUNHAM would be coming back from

New York City today, and that NED MURPHY would also possibly

pe naturning.

In the past, GRADY and MURPHY have both mentioned

that joe O'RoUrke would be involved in some way in this action.:.

MURPHY had indicated that he would possibly be

bringing someone backwith him when he returned to Canden.

MURPHY also indicated that ANN was going to New York City

in order to get some commitments from some other people

who would be involved in the action. BOB GOOD, who left

for New York City this morning, is due to be back in Camden

on Thursday.

Last Monday, GRADY said if the action does not

"come off" within the next ten days or so, that he would

get away for a while, COOKIE and ANITA have voiced the

same sentiment.

GRADY said that he was not sure what they would

do with the material which they obtain from the draft board.

GRADY did say, however, that they normally burn the material,

and that they often find an abandoned farm some place and

make a big. fire with the material.

Duxing discussions of the action, GRADy and NED

MURPHY

mentioned the possibility of going into the Army

Intelligence Office.

COOKIE, ANITA, BOB GOOD, and in this

instance, MURPHY, have at times interjected the thought as

to hitting the Army Intelligence Office.

MURPHY said that

there is no reason for having an Army Intelligence Office

in the Camden Post Office Building, and that "they must have

something. very good in there that would be helpful to the

group.".

It was mentioned that they would probably destroy

those records that they were not able to carry away from the

draft board.

It was mentioned that they would probably "rip

up?" those files.

It was also mentioned that at a previous

action they had taken a paper cutter into the draft board for

the purpose of destroying the files, but that someone

• left

the paper cutter and fingerprints were found on it.

BOB GOOD mentioned that over eight hundred files

Kilken during the recent Massachusetts Draft Board action.

Ados also mentioned that these files were mailed to the

registrants. COOKIE said that they had done the same thing

once before, mailing a couple of hundred files to the respective

registrants.

GOOD did not relate subsequently as to how he

acquired the knowledge regarding the Massachusetts action,

but he (GOOD) indicated that information concerning that action

is now common-knowledge within the underground movement.

It was mentioned by members of the group last night

that during the surveillances prior to the Trenton Draft Board

action, that the group used a code when talking over the radios.

HARDY advised that upon arriving at the roof of the

"Fillnore" he met GENE DIXON and then

shortly thereafter GRADY

came.

This was approximately 1:30 and at this time the

following people had congregated on the roof: JOHN GRADY,

ANITA, COOKIE, GENE DIXON, and NED MURPHY. The group then

had a l5-minute conference talking over what all they had

seat!

in the surveillance.

At this time it was decided that since

ANN DUNHAM, and ANITA would stay at the ANDERSON home and that

COOKIE would go to GENE DIXON's apartment. It was further

decided that the group would meet at Dr. ANDERSON's home that

night at l p.m.; that they would start out early in the evening

to go over

the plans in order to prepare for a full dry run

Saturday night.

HARDY explained that the group was planning to estab-

lish surveillances at 10 o'clock Friday night rather than 1l

because there had been changes in the shifts of the people

working inside the Post Office and they wanted to gather more

information regarding people going in and out of the Post Office.

HARDY explained that the group expected BOB GOOD to

be back along with MIKE DOYLE, MIKE GIOCONDO, and possibly MEI.

MADDEN.

HARDY further explained thai the group

did. not go

to the Rutgers Law School Building last night because ine building

is now pretty well lighted and that it is impractical to do any

tion of documents and plans as being ten large 24 by 36 sheets

of poster board containing street maps with plastic overlays

on them so that the group can write down their observations

and then as developments arise they can later erase them.

HARDY stated that a full dress rehersal will be con-

dueted Saturday night.

He described this as cars moving in the

area with the ideal thing being that people will actually fill

the observation and surveillance spots that will be occupied

during the actual hit.

HARDY noted that GRADY seems to be well rested' now •

and is thinking clearly.

He is not drinking as much as he has

in the past and is his normal self:

ROBERI WILLIAM HARDY telephonically contacted Special

Agent TERRENCE P. NEIST and advised as follows:

On July 30, 1971, he went to the residence of Doctor

WILLIAM A. ANDERSON, Collingswood, N. J. Upon his arrival

he noted that Doctor ANDERSON's family had returned from their

summer home in Sea Isle City, N. J., and that the GRADY family

was in the process of moving out of the ANDERSON residence and

getting ready to leave for their campsite at the shore.

As he drove up to the residence, JOHN GRADY called

signalled for him to back his truck up to the. ANDERSON

residence..

GRADY then told him to put GRADY's personal effects,

posed Camden Draft Board hit, into his truck and to, sometime

during the next day, take these materials to the apartment of

morning and then return to the Camden area around lunchtime.

Before

the GRADY family had left; COOKIE, ANITA, ANN

DUNHAM, and MIKE GIOCONDO took Mrs. GRADY's brother, Father MIKE

SHAUGHNESSY, to the Philadelphia Airport where he would take a

Flight to Washington, D. C., enroute to Detroit, Mich.

HARDY and NED MURPHY left together and met with MIKE

GIOCONDO at GIOCONDO's apartment, Third and Cooper Streets,

Camden, N. J.

While enroute to GIOCONDO's apartment, HARDY asked

if any other people would be coming down for the action. MURPHY

replied that there would be nothing to worry about because plenty

of people would be coming here for the action when the time came.

MURPHY indicated

that the only thing that was necessary was for

GRADY to set the

time and that once the time was set the people

would respond to GRADY's call.

Before ANN DUNHAM left, she asked HARDY to leave his

phone number with Doctor ANDERSON so that when her boyfriend

FRANK (last name unknown) arrived in the Camden area on Saturday

he would be able to get in touch with him.

Last night GIOCONDO said that GRADY had told him

(GIOCONDO) that he (GRADY) would be sleeping at Doctor ANDERSON'S

"Flat" and would more than likely hold the group meetings there

rather than at GENE DIXON'S apartment.

Last night he went to GIOCONDO's apartment at approxi-

mately 9:45.

When he arrived MURPHY and GIOCONDO were there.

They decided upon three observation positions to be used on

that night. One position was in his ( HARDY) van, which will

be parked in front of the little bazaar which is located between

Fourth and Fifth Streets on Market Street directly across from

the United States Post Office Building. It was deternined that

HARDY would make observations as to when the night watchman

arrived and if and when he came out of the building: GIOCONDO.

was to be in GRADY's Comet (with New York license tags) parked

at Fourth Street and Markley Avenue (alley). GIOCONDO was to

observe the night watchman with regard to his entering the mail

platform in the rear of the Post Office building.. NED MURPHY

PH 52-7165 SUB S

was to be on the roof of the l'ownhouse Apartments where he

would observe any movement on the wings of the Post Office

building on the third, fourth, and fifth floors.

At 12:30

a.m. it was planned for HARDY to start his

truck and travel on Fourth Street toward Cooper Street. MURPHY

would see the

i cooper

truck coming and would then come around the corter.

GIOCONDO would also see the truck and the three of them would

then rendezvous at GIOCONDO's apartment.

They performed their observations that night

according to the above-mentioned plans.

During the observations they learned that at 10 p.m.

when HARDY drove to the front of the Post Office building the

guard was standing by the doorway.

HARDY went over to the

guard and talked to him on the pretext of buying some stamps

from the stamp machine.

He found out from the guard that he

is relieved at 11:45 to 12 midnight.

After this, the group

perforned two and one half hours of observations.

At approximately 12:30 a.m. HARDY made the righi

hand turn onto Fourth Street,

according to the plans,

and

subsequent to that met GIOCONDO and MURPHY at GIOCONDO's apart-

When they met they discussed

what had been. seen by the

their observations.

It was agreed upon

the others.

HARDY advised that during previous talks with MURPHY,

ANITA, and COOKIE, it was mentioned that the group would con-

duct a

dry run on

Saturday night (July 31, 1971) on a large-

as-possible scale with as many people as possible involved.

When HARDY left the meeting he took NED MURPHY to

GENE DIXON'S

Before leaving last night GRADY told him that he

had gotten a letter from DAN and PHIL BERRIGAN and said that

the letter was very encouraging and that money was received

with the letter.

It was mentioned that the person from North Jersey who

would be bringing down the camping equipment for the Grady.

amily would be father JOE SHUSTER. From the conversation it

was apparent that SHUSTER is a friend of the GRADys from either

East Orange, N. J., Union, N. J., or one of the northern New

Jersey cities.

It was also apparent from the conversation that:

he is a priest.

HARDY recalled that Mrs. GRADY said that

"Father JOE is bringing our camping equipment down."

then inquired of Mrs. GRADY as to the identity of Father JOE.

Mrs, GRADY replied that he was Father JOE SHUSTER.

As the girls were Leaving,

a friendof MIKE GIOCONDO'S

named MILO BILLMAN stopped by GIOCONDO's apartment.

BILLMAN

lives on Fourth Street, between Cooper and Arch Streets. From

the conversation, it was apparent that BILLMAN is well aware of

the plans with regard to the proposed hit.

BILLMAN is a white male, approximately 34 years of age.

He has a very bushy beard, a very full head of hair, and "looks

like Moses."

He is a Presbyterian Minister and works for the

Canden Metropolitan Ministry. He works with another minister

named SAM. APPLE (ph).

BILLMAN left at approximately 10:15 p.M. At that time

NED MURPHY and ED MC GOWAN arrived at GIOCONDO's apartment. They

said that they would be in the area until Sunday night.

MC GOWAN expressed his disappointment when he learned

that GRADY was down at the shore and indicated that he desirad

to talk to GRADY. It was mentioned that he (MC GOWAN) would

possibly ride down to the shore to see GRADY and GRADY's family.

It was apparent from the conversation that MC GOWAN is

friend of the GRADY family.

It was decided that he (HARDY) would take NED MURPHY

and ED MC GOWAN to Doctor ANDERSON's apartment, so that MC GOWAN.

could "get the feeling of what is going on here."

At that point BOB GOOD was on the roof of the Townhouse

Apartments, having come there at approximately 10:00 p.m..

"ED has

been around for quite a while. He has been involved in several

actions with us, and we would like him to see what's going on

so. that he can get the feel of it."

horn-rimmed glasses with dark trames.

(The new style with

large glass in then.)

Last night he wore a pair of Levis,

a sport shirt, and loafers

without socks.

He seemed to be

quiet and observant.

For instance, when he entered his

(HARDY's) truck; he immediately noticed the type of work

that HARDY does.

He (HARDY) left GIOCONDO's apartment in his truck

with MC GOWAN and MURPHY.

They went to Doctor ANDERSON'S

apartment. so that MC GOWAN could see "what was going on.".

Upon arriving at ANDERSON's apartment, however, they wera

unable to gain entrance to the building. This was due to

the fact that no one answered the telephone or door bell

when they called.

After that, they went to the roof of the Townhouse

Apartments, arriving

at approximately 11:30 p.m. Also present

on the roof at that time were BOB GOOD and MIKE GIOCONDO.

After a period of time on the roof HARdY left the roof and

goi back into his truck.

Last night a new name was mentioned. HARDY

was

unable to recall exactly the name of this person but believed

it was something like "LENA MOSER OF MUSHER."

It was mentioned

that this girl was due in today. According to the conversation,

she is from New York.

It was mentioned that REILLY had been in Buffalo prior

to coming to the Camden action. It was indicated that she was

in Buffalo to work in connection with the "action," which GOOD ans

has previously talked about, which is planned for in Buffalo.:

It was mentioned that FRANK POMMERSHEIM would be:.

BUCKALEW mentioned that they had come to the meeting

in his pickup truck.

Later in the evening he (HARDY) drove around the

area trying to spot a pickup truck that generally fit the

description

Of BUCKALEW's truck.

He noted a blue Chevrolet

of BUCKALOO's truck. This truck had a wooden damper built on

the back of it.

Although he felt that the truck with the Ohio license

plate might be BUCKAlEW's truck, he noted another truck that

came close to meeting the description.

This truck was a blue

Chevrolet van-type pickup, which. bore license CW-31004.

During the conversation, WILLIAMSON asked GIOCONDO

how RO RO REILLY had been doing with regard to making the con-

tacks with people outside the area.. GIOCONDO said that RO RO

REILLY had

contacted PAUL COUMING and that PAUL COUMING would

definitely be coming down this weekend. GIOCONDO also said that

ANN DUNHAM had called from New York and said that she and FRANK

POMERSHEIM would definitely be down Friday afternoon. GIOCONDO

said that the contact from Buffalo, N.Y., had not as

yet given

an answer as to whether or not anyone from Buffalo would be

coming to the area.

They then left and went to Doctor ANDERSON's apartmant,

Broadway

and Royden Streets, Canden, N.J. When

they arrived, they

noted that BOB GOOD and RO RO REILLY were at the apartment working

on the charts.

WILLIAMSON, BUCKALEW, and KIRK remained at ANDERSON'S

apartment with GOOD and REILLY, while GIOCONDO and HARDY

went

back to the area of the United

I States Post Office Building so

that they could watch the front of the building.

They (HARDY

and GIOCONDO)stayed in front of the Post Office Building until

about 10:45 p.m., at which time chay went back to ANDERSON's

apartment and picked up everyone and brought them all to GeNE

DIXON's apartment.

They picked up

some equipment at DIXON's and then went to GIOCONDO's apartment,

arriving at approximately 11:05 p.m.

He (HARDY)

dropped off everyone there and it was

planned that TERRY and KIRK would go to the rooftop with either

GIOCONDO Or REILLY, in order to observe from there.

He (HARDY) then drove around Market Street to the

been to the rooftop of

the Townhouse Apartments in the past.

person, on Sunday, want to church service at the Methodist Church

behind the Post Office Building and after church, they hid in the

back of the church and stayed there all night observing the Post.

Office Building. Apparently BUCKALSW was part of the group that

did this.

It was mentioned by GOOD that KIRK was in the past

over here giving "lockpicking" instructions at ANDERSON's

residence,

at which time he spent one night on the rooftop of the lownhouse

Apartments with a couple members of the group.

He learned that the girls were able to find out

where at least half the files are kapt and that they will also

go back into the draft board again today at about 3:30.

HARDY advised that TERRY BUCKALEW worked on the

personnel problems as far as where people would be gleeping and

also on the entrance into the draft board. He stated that a

i), proble

little later in the evening RORO helped him with chis task.

HARDY advised that he ascertained the following

operational procedure from TERRY BUCKALEW for the actual

"entrance team":

There will be

a team of eight people with TERRY

BUCKALEW acting as the driver of the truck.

Those people con

prising the entrance tean are MIKE GIOCONDO, MIKE DOYLE, BOB

GOOD,

BOB WILLIAMSON, PAUL, COUMING, COOKIE, RORO REILLY, and

ANN

DUNHAM.

The entrance team will be broken up inco chree

smaller reams.

One team will be MIKE DOYLE, BOB GOOD, and

COOKIE.

They have

the responsibility of handling Draft Board

Number 9 which is in the Fifth and Market Streets corner of

the draft board room.

The second team will be MIKE GIOCONDO,

Number a wnich is in the Markley Avenue and Flith Straat

WILLIAMSON. They will handle Draft Board

corner of the draft board room.

The third tean will be ANN

DUNHAM and PAUL. COUMING.

COUMING's main job is to handle the

radio contact with the outside.

While they were going over the entrance tean's dusy

it was brought up that there is a conference room off of

che

draft board area which

is part of the draft board and has a

of windous.

The draft board employees use

this for their

ferences.

It came out in the meeting that it might be easier

to make

entry into the

draft board through the conference room

windows rather than waiting around for about twenty minutes

to drill the glass windows

in the draft board itself.

It was

the consensus of the group

that this should be explored and

checked out.

HARDY explained that the group is interested

in

the daft board conference

room becauge they are worried that

the guard may see brokon glass if they actempt to enter tha

draft board by breaking one of the windows.

MARUY explained

that the guard does not have

access and cannot sue from the

draft board area the windows which are in the conference room.

At approximately 7:30 p.a, BOB WILLIAMSON cune in.

At about 3:30, HARDY advised, the group finishad

eating some sandwiches

and shortly thereafter JOHN SWINGLISH

worked on developing a new and sinpler code which will be

used over the radio.

Shortly thereafter the consensus of the group was

that the members of the entrance team should go and practice

on the ladders at PHIL MURRAY's, located at 312 Friends Avenua,

Camden, N. 3.

The group did go to MURRAY's and practiced on the

ladders for about twenty minutes after which they returned io

ANDERSON's and practiced with the glass drill with BOB GOOD

doing the

instructing.

At approximately 9:15 MIKE DOYLE came in for about

351 hour 05 50.

When he arrived GRADY asked DOYLE if some of

his priestly friends who said that the group could use sone of

their cars were still up to it. DOYLE said

no, and that they

had

all backed out.

At approximately 10:00 p.n. the group went to the

front room of Doctor ANDERSON's apartnent facing Broadway

whereupon COOKIE started to explain what the team action woul

be once

While COOKIE was

explaining the entrance team's duties, RORO REILLY and TERRY

BUCKALEW were setting up a

"card system" that would indicate

who would be staying whare.

HARDY learned that MIKE GIOCONDO had taken the

day off and will take tomorrow off in order to locate

a suitable

truck sufficient for the group's needs.

HARDY explained that

it was now decided that the

group wants

sort of a steak-body

like truck

with at least six-foot walls.

He explained that

they want the open-bed bruck because they want to be able to

Just lip the

Ladetes onto the roof and in that way the entrance

ream will not have to get out of the truck to get up the ladders.

HARDY also learned that MIKE GIOCONDO and MIXE

DOYLE are going into the draft board today at approximately

10 o'clock this morning to see what they can.

The idea vas to

just get the physical lay-out of the roon.

GRADY would like

everyone who is going

into the building on the actual night

of the action to gat in there at least once before the action

so that they will be a little bit familiar with the floorplan.

At this point PAUL COUMING said that on the after

noon of the night of the "Boston Eight" action he want into

the drait board and talked to the lady there abour his draft

records,

That night the group went in and destroyed his drait

recorde and a

week later he surfaced and clained the responsi

bility for this thing.

The question was raised that it was

risky to go into the draft board; however, COUMIGN said that

he was never questioned about it.

HARDY advioed that JOHN GRADY ON PAUL COUYINS wOUL

be going to the hadlo Shack, on Routa 130 at 12 o'cles in order

19

enchange one of the headsets that is not working at the

nonent. It seems that

sonathing is wrong with the pover system.

A little later BOB WILLIAMSON said that he had talked

to some people in Philadelphia about using their cars and that

he was able to guarantee at least three cars fron Philadelphia,

At this time he mentioned two names of people

volved

in the action.

One is DAN DOUGHERTY. and the othar is an

EMILY. EMILY has a Volkswagen which the group will be able to

ust.

At the present time the following persons' cara will

be used: MIKE DOYLE, MIKE GIOCONDO, BILL ANDERSON, TERKY

BUCKALEW, aNd MEL MADDEN.

It was also mentioned by MIKE GIOCONDO that he had

been talking to MILO BILLIAN.

BILLMAN lives at Fourth Streer

between Cooper and Arch and

has agreed if seeded io be of some

nelp Saturday night. The idea is that

at the time of entrance,

aTLIMAN gill back his car out of his alley onto Fourth street

and thereby block fourth street for to m126×2.

plained that this would successfully eliminate

any traffic

they want.

Because of this they feel very confident about

breaking into the Army Intelligenca Office.

HARDY explained that they have all the tools thay

These tools consiet

of a floor chisel, a flat pry bar,. and a large screwdriver.
