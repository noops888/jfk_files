OGC searches under JFK Act

Per your request, OGC has conducted searches for documents regarding Lawrence Houston and Scott

Breckinridge for the time period 1959-64

There are no OGC files on either individual. However, documents were located on each individual as

described below.

With respect to Scott Breckinridge, compute searches of OGC record systems were conducted and

approxi:rately 100 documents were located, dating from 1977 to 1996. I have reviewed the computer

summaries of all these documents, only 5 mention HSCA or President Kennedy which / will make available

to you. The remainder deal with prepublication review of manuscripts written by Breckinridge. One

document deals with a unrelated FOIA request by another individual which mentions Breckinridge's name.

I will retain these summaries should you wish to review them yourself.

With regard's to Lawrence Houston, during the relevant time period, OGC published a volume entitled

"Opinions of the Office of General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency". Each volume contains all the

opinions from all the attorneys in the office during a particular year. I am currently in the processing of

reviewing the volumes for 1959-64. Please advise as to how you want to handle the appropriate review of

these volumes.
