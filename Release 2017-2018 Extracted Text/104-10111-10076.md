Mr. David L. Christ is recommended for the Intelligence Medal

of Merit in recognition of his career of especially meritorious service

which has contributed significantly to the missions of CIA.

Mr. Christ joined CIA in November of 1950 as the first research

and

development electronics engineer in what has evolved as TSD.

created an Applied Physics Branch setting high standards for himself

and the R&D engineers he recruited.

His accomplishments included the

anti-disturbance mine and the time pencil, both of which are still

Agency stock items, and an iR beacon.

As a pioneer in audio surveillance

devices, he recognized very early that the use of systems concept

would be most productive in meeting Agency needs.

As part of his

development program, his efforts led to,which in 1953 was the first

the establishment of specialized

contract facilities

Agency source of transistorized equipment.?4

In early 1957, Mr. Christ was made Chief of what is now the Audio

Operations Branch of TSD and, realizing that a drastic upgrading of

the caliber of field technicians was required, began aggressively re-

cruiting and training graduate engineers.

His

high standards and

efforts in this area are reflected in the fact that the majority of

TSD Audio mid-management personnel were recruited by him.

In September

1960, he and two associates were apprehended while on an operation in

a denied area. His exemplary conduct and personal courage

during the resulting two and one-half years incarceration

permitted the maintenance of

and

a very difficult cover situation

successful extraction of all three men.

Upon his return, Mr. Christ joined the Office of Research

and Development soon after its inception, assisting in the

definition and establishment of the various divisions.

Under

his early guidance, the over-the-horizon radar program developed

finally into an operational system.

His sensitivity to the

needs of Agency operational elements based upon his experience,

his

technical

expertise and his dedicated desire to broaden

the technological capabilities of the Agency precipitated

his development of a major coordinated program of

accelerated

R&D to provide the

clandestine services with a number of new

audio surveillance techniques of which the laser probe is an.

example, and his conception and direction of the Microtechnology

R&D program.

Within this program, the success of the micro-

power transistor led to the award of Medals of Merit to two

scientists under his supervision. Other progeny of the micro-

technology concept are three novel intelligence gathering

systems to function in the air, in space, and in the sea

environments, one of which is approaching operational status.

Mr. Christ has also been responsible for pioneering efforts

in the area of Audio Surveillance Countermeasures, first pro-

posing the application of computers to the problem.

Mr. Christ's imaginative leadership and inspiration to

those working with him, his broad scope of interest, his resource-

fulness, and philosophical devotion to the cause of the Agency

and the

United States have provided this Agency with an individua)

whose unique efforts and

accomplishments over his 20 years

service are worthy of this recognition.
