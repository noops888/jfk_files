"World Marxist Review"

also referred to as

the enclosed LHM, has been subject to past inquiry in

Bufile 105-71639 and NY 100-137025.

CG 5824-S advised

on 11/15/73 and on 12/15/73

and nis wile

(NY 100-12959), recently returned to NYC from Prague

where he represented the CPUSA on the editor board of

"World Marxist Review"; that JOHN PITIMAN, who might

now be seriously ill, volunteered for the job

since it

would give him an opportunity to secure expert medical

aid in Prague.

Further, that his wife, MARGRIT PITTMAN,

wants to go with him, but she wants to live in Berlin,

Bast Germany, only

a one hour flight from Prague, where

she could act as

"Daily World" correspondent.

CG 5824-S advised that the CPUSA is apprehensive

about MARGRIT PITTMAN'S

"petty bourgeoise nationalistic"

feelings for the East German CP which cause her to put

the CPUSA. Further, that the CPUSA feels that she

must be restrained from

dominating her husband, and that

if she goes to East Germany, that Party, must be told

that she is not a representative of the CPUSA in East

Germany.

CG 5824-s noted on 1/3/74 that MARGRIT

PITTMAN, a naturalized US citizen, born in Germany,

has strong feelings favorable to the East German CP;

Germany.
