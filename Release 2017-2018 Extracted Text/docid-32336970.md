Field Comments:

1.

A fairly reliable source reported on 25 June 1958

that a rebel force in the Sierra Escambray was successfully

employing guerrilla tactics against a much larger con-

tingent of the Cuban Armed Forces, and, at the same time;

winning the sympathy of the natives in

that area.

The source of Field Comment No. 1 above also

reported the presence of an American war veteran

among the rebels.

One William Alexander Morgan was

identified in the 8 April and 17 May 1958 issues of

or Wetzler may possibly be identical with the American

rebel leader of this and/or the above-mentioned report..

The above has not been disseminated in, the Embassy inasmuch

as information submitted by Lieutenant Vila has not yet been verified

and information submitted by

the CIA is known to be available to all

interested agencies

This office is continuing to follow this matter and the

Bureau will be kept advised of pertinent information. (dU)
