INTERNATIONAL ANTI-COMMUNIST BRIGADE [AeB)

The October 21, 1968, edition of the "Diario

de Yucatan'

, a Merida, Yucatan daily newspaper, carried

a dispatch datelined at Progreso, on October 20, 1968,

which was devoted to the disappearance of the Americans

aboard the ship "El Amigo". The article stated that:

one of the passengers,

supplies for the trip in a grocery store called

"Villa del Mar' for which he paid with a $50 travelers

check drawn on the American Express Company, 65 Broadway,

New York, New York. The check was reportedly invalid

and

bore the number N-A-63-070-069.

On October 30, 1968, the American Consul, Merida,

Yucatan, Mexico, advised that a photograph of FRANK ANTHONY

STURGIS, also known as FRANK FIORINI,

had been identified

by Mr. EDUARDO ESCALANTE, who observed the group before

they left Yucatan, as the member of the group who called

himself "MAX GORMAN" and wore a beret.

The Consul further advised that Mr. MAYNARD

CLAYTON, Director of the Benjamin Franklin Institute

In Merida, reported on October 29, 1968, that a tour

guide named GARCIA had been approached by "GORMAN"

who requested him to lead a group to the Guatemalan

frontier overland, ostensibly to go hunting. GARCIA

refused, pointing out that the hunting season was not

yet open and the authorities would certainly detain any-

one in

the area bearing arms.

On November 5, 1968, MM T-1, a confidential

source abroad, advised that the Mexican Federal Attorney

1969 10

General's Office has not prepared formal charges against

who were taken into custody at

Belize, British Honduras on October 23, 1968, after

forcing a Mexican ship captain to take them there from

Progreso, Yucatan.

Neither did the Mexican Government

request their extradition from British Honduras.

Mexican Government expects the 13 men to be released

to the United States Government and is still studying

the matter of possible prosecution.

However, it is doubtful

that any as to est len asinet these men untess

On November 6, 1968,

MM T-3 advised that on

October 29, 1968, several of

the subjects had been interviewed

by authorities at Belize, British Honduras, and the following

information had resulted from these interviews:)

a) That FIORINI had been named FRANK FIORINI at

birth and had changed his name legally sone years ago in

Norfolk, Virginia, to FRANK ANTHONY STURGIS following the

remarriage of his mother.

FIORINI was the leader of the expedition and may

have been the only one who knew precisely where the group

was headed. He gave the impression of being a professional

"con-man" who

was prepared to tell whatever story suits him. (C)

b) That FIORINI and GONZALEZ are long-time members

of the Secret Army Organization of the IACB, and that HULBERT

claims to have acted as a recruiter for FIORINI. (e)

c) That recruiting was carried out by newspaper

advertisements, in the Florida area and by personal contacts.

d) That the subjects,

apart from FIORINI, GONZALEZ,

and possibly HULBERT, appear to

be of fairly low caliber.

They were

probably attracted by the prospects of money and

adventure.:

Some of them would probably have been equally

attracted to a criminal venture. (C)

3) That the subjects had been promised substantial

payments in return for their services by FIORINI but, in fact.,

had been paid nothing to date, according to those intervewed. ()

1)

That some of the arms belonging to group members

were their

personal

property and had been carried with them

from Florida.

that she is the daughter of MAX GONZALEZ, who,

as far as she knows,

is in a Miami, Florida, jail,

having been arrested by the FBI as

the result of

a plot against Cuban Prime Minister FIDEL CASTRO.

It is noted that a telephone call to G. M.

Used Cars, 2480 Northwest 36th Street, Miami, Florida,

on December 18, 1968, disclosed that GONZALEZ,

who had been a

salesman for that firm prior to his

departure on

the IACB expedition,

continued to be

incarcerated in the Dade County Jail, as of this

date, awaiting trial on bad check charges. GONZALEZ

was arrested on these local charges immediately after

his arrival from British Honduras.

He has not been

As a result of information given by CAMPOS to the Customs

From the infor-

a pistol loaded with 6 rounds was found hidden in the cabin.

The Mexican and United States Consulate authorities vere

notified of the circumstances known at that time.

3.

The two Mexican nationals were questioned separately, and

bọth told the same story.

The 'AMIGO'

Cont ideatzat

On November 6, 1968, MM T-3 advised that on

October 29, 1968, several of the subjects had been interviewed

by authorities at Belize, British Honduras, and the following

information had resulted

from these interviews: C)

a) That FIORINI had been named FRANK FIORINI at

birth and had changed his name legally some years ago in

Norfolk, Virginia, to FRANK ANTHONY STURGIS following the

remarriage of his mother.

FIORINI was the leader of the expedition and may

have been the only one who knew precisely where the group

was headed. He gave the impression of being a professional

"con-man" who was prepared to tell whatever story suits him(C

b) That FIORINI and GONZALEZ are long-time members

of the Secret Army Organization of the IACB, and that HULBERT

claims to have acted as a recruiter for FIORINI.

c) That recruiting was carried out by newspaper

advertisements in the Florida area and by personal contacts (C

• d) : That the subjects, apart from FIORINI, GONZALEZ,

and possibly HULBERT, appear to be of fairly low caliber.

They were

probably attracted by the prospects of money and

adventure.

Some.of them would probably have been equally

attracted to a criminal venture. (C

3) That the subjects had been promised substantial

payments in return for their services by FIORINI but, in fact

had been paid nothing to date, according to those intervewed (C)

f). That some of the arms belonging to group members

were their personal property and had been carried with them

person poor

from Florida.

That some of the subjects crossed

the U. S.

That all the subjects crossed the

U.S. - Mexican border at Brownsville, Texas. (C)

i)

That the IACB undoubtedly has some

funds but that FIORINI's claim to have fifteen

million U.S. dollars in Switzerland for aid of

political prisoners in Cuba is more likely to be

false then true. (C)

That FIORINI and GONZALEZ apparently

intended to continue their anti-CASTRO activities. (e)

It is noted that the serial numbers of

the two weapons purchased by CURTIS from the Boca

Tackle Shop are identical with those of two of the

weapons included in the above "list of arms,

ammunition and other items" furnished by MM

T-2

on November 4, 1968.

On November 21,

1968, DOLORES COLON,

327 Fillmore Street, Staten Island, New York,

was interviewed under a suitable pretext and advised

that she is the daughter of MAX GONZALEZ, who,

as tar as she knows,

is in a Miami, Florida, jail,

having been arrested

by the FBI as

the result of

a plot against Cuban Prime Minister FIDEL CASTRO.

It is noted that a telephone call to G. M.

Used Cars,

2480 Northwest 36th Street, Miami, Florida,

on December 18, 1968, disclosed that GONZALEZ,

who had been a salesman for that firm prior to his

departure on the IACB expedition, continued to be:

incarcerated in the Dade County Jail, as of this

date, awaiting trial on bad check charges.

GONZALEZ

was arrested on these local charges immediately after

his arrival from British Honduras.

He has not been

arrested by the FBI.
