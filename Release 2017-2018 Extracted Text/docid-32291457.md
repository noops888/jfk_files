MORRIS LITBERG continues to reside at 2029 South

Garth, Los Angeles, and his bakery operation is located

at 1583 Colorado Eagle Rock, in the greater Los Angeles

area. At both of these locations he is known as LEE TUTTLE.

The residence and employment of his son, HAROLD,

is unknown. It is not believed advisable to ask him the

whereabouts of his son at this time.

It is suggested that his residence only be given

It is noted that LIBERG has indicated in the past

in stray terms that he will not testify against ALDERISIO.

Re: TRIAL POSTPONEMENT

AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

On October 9, 1964, U. S. Attorney WILLIAM MEADOWS

advised that he had that date received a telegraphic message

from the Department of Justice, Washington, D. C., which re-

quested him on the behalf of both prosecution and defense to

request a one week postponement of the trial scheduled for

October 20, 1964. Mr. MEADOWS stated Judge FULTON granted

the one week postponement and placed the ALDERISIO-WERNER

case at the end of his calendar for the week of October 26, 1964.

As of October 9, 1964, Judge FULTON pointed out he already

had four civil trials scheduled for the week of October 26,

1964, and therefore he could not be sure what day during the

week of October 26, 1964, the trial of ALDERISIO and WERNER

would. commence.

Re: TRIAL PREPARATION AND INVESTIGATION

On September 25, 1964, Departmental Attorney KENNEY

advised that he and Mr. MEADOWS expected to leave Miami on

the night of September

28, 1964, and have an appointment to

interview EGAN in Denver on September 29, 1964, at Mr. KENNEY"S

requested that all fD-302s on interviews with EGAN, BRAY, KAY

and BROOK be made available to the prosecutor since they

expected that the defense attorney might invokee the Jencks *

Rule and request these.

On October 9, 1964, original FD-302s on BRAY, EGAN,.

KAY and BROOK were made available to Departmental Attorney

EDWARD HARRINGTON.

On October 5, 1964, a Xerox copy of the time 1og

dated October 9, 1963, reporting the apprehension of ALDERISIO

at Chicago by Bureau Agents was made available to U. S. Attorneý

WILLIAM MEADOWS per his request which was made to FBI Agents

in Chicago on his recent visit there.

On October 5, 1964, the conference in Mr. MEADOWS'

office participated in

by Mr. MEADOWS, Departmental Attorneys

WILLIAM KENNEY and EDWARD HARRINGTON and SA JOHN P. LENIHAN

it was desired that other persons ALDERISIO had either threatened

or beaten up would be subpoenaed and even if they refused to

testify the effect they would have on any possible testimony

from ALDERISIO or strategy used by the defense attorney might

be effected.. It was desired that MORRIS LITBERG and his son

HAROLD of Los Angeles as well as the SEGAL brothers in New York

would probably be subpoenaed for this purpose.

On October 6, 1964, Mr. KENNEY advised that he

did not have a current

address for MORRIS and HAROLD LITBERG

and he had telephonically requested the FBI Office in Los

Angeles to forward the most recent available address of the

LITBERGs to the FBI Office in Miami.

On October 7, 1964, Mr. KENNEY was advised that

MORRIS LITBERG possibly resides at 2029 South Garth Street,

Los Angeles, that he is generally known as LEE TUTTLE but

the address of his son HAROLD is unknown.

AT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

MORRIS LITBERG advised on October 9, 1964, that he

had not changed his mind about testifying against ALDERISIO.

Under no circumstances will he do so, even if he has to go

to jail for contempt of court.. His reasons are the same:

fear for the lives of his family and his own. He has good

reason because he was beaten by ALDERISIO and others, five

times and almost killed.

He also pointed out that his son, HArOLD, knew

nothing about ALDERISIO and would be unable to testify to

anything, even if he wanted to, which he does not.

He also stated that in addition to the above,

one day away from his baking business, which is a one-man

operation, would completely ruin him.

AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

On October 13, 1964, the above data provided by :

MORRIS LITBERG waS made

available to U.S. Attorney MEADOWS

and Departmental Attorney KENNEY who advised they would take

the matter under consideration.

AT NEW YORK CITY

Departmental Attorney WILLIAM KENNEY telephonically

advised the New York Office that he intended to come to New

York City on October 19, 1964, to interview SEYMOUR DANIEL

SEGAL and ALLEN IRVING

SEGAL.
