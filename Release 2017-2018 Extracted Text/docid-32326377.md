'ADMINISTRATIVE -

Interviews of FELIPE FERNANDEZ PUJOL and BRAULIO

DE GONDOMAR concerning the "Cuban Relief Corporation"

were predicated on a letter dated January 23, 1962, from

ROBERT H. HOADLEY, 944 S. W. Second Street, Miami, Florida,

wherein it was stated ARTURO BOLIVAR, also of 944 S. W.

Second Street, possessed information concerning FLOYD S.

GLICK and HAROLD H. KASSIN,

1305 Congress Building, Miami.

BOLIVAR was contacted and advised that FELIPE FERNANDEZ

had gone to the office of GLICK and KASSIN in connection

with the Cuban Relief Corporation.

The Miami Office has previously reported activities

Of ROY HARGRAVES, JOE GORMAN, and STEVE WILSON, mentioned in

this report, in reports on INTERPEN (Intercontinental

Penetration

Forces) (Miami file 2-312).

Delay since submission of the last Miami report,

January 31, 1962, resulted from assignments of Agent on

SGE investigations, espionage fisur, and subpoena to another

division.
