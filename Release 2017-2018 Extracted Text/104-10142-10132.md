5. (Seeret PG) LIAISON Received a telephone call from

Peter Stockton, on the staff of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power,

House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Mr. Stockton

wished to inquire as to whether we had received and understood a recent

letter on NUMEC from Chairman John D. Dingell (D., Mich.). I told

him that I had and informed him of the arrangements we projected for

briefings. There ensued a long discussion as to MI. Stockton's

preferences for the mode of briefing. which I informed him I could not

guarantee. It was left that I would check with the appropriate CIA

element, and inform Mr. Stockton of the results when I had them.

6. (Genfidential - DTC) LIAISON Talked to G. Robert Blakey,

Chief Counsel, and Staff Director, House Select Committee on

Assassinations, to make arrangements for staff personnel to review

certain DDO documents here at Headquarters on 30 October.
