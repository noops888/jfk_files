TP T-10 stated that WILKINSON never,

to his

knowledge, operated any type of gambling operation of his

own,

although he used to like to gamble and habitually

went to Cuba to spend time there at the area known as

Verderado (phonetic) Beach.

While in Cuba, WILKINSON would shoot craps at

the little casinos there, but other than playing poker

with friends and occasional bet with an acquaintance on a

football game or basketball game, he never actively engaged

in gambling.

TP T-10 stated that while in Cuba, WILKINSON

became a close friend of one GUSTAVA BUSTAMONTE, who

presently resides in Fort Lauderdale,

Florida, somewhere

near where WILKINSON lives now.

Because of this association

with BUSTAMONTE,

it was rumored in Mobile at one time that

WILKINSON brought thousands of dollars out of Cuba at the

time of the Castro revolution.

TP T-10 stated he knew

personally this to be a false rumor, but said that WILKINSON

liked"

to have such rumors being passed around as that lent

credence to his way of life and indicated to people that

he had a considerable amount of money.

TP. T-10 said that WILKINSON has, over the years,

made and lost a great deal of money and in one deal alone,

received one million dollars for his share in an insurance

company

He stated that at present, WILKINSON is devoting

his full time to an insurance company, name unrecalled, and

that during the previous week, he had

attempted to interest

TP T-10 in selling his used car business and investing in

this insurance company

TP T-I0 stated that since he had

devoted his while life to the used car business, he had no

desire to leave this business

to start another one.

TP T-10 further stated that WILKINSON is the type

of individuai who keeps all money in his possession

invested in various enterprises and at one time, purchased

a motel in Mobile for one hundred thousand dollars, bank

cated he was the sole owner of the enterprise.

As an

example of how little cash WILKINSON keeps,

TP T-i0 stated

that often, he borrows money in twenty and fifty dollar

amounts when in Mobile because his finances are all tied

up in investments.
