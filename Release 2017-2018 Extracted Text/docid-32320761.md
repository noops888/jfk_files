MEMORANDUM FOR ROBERT M. BRYANT

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

SUBJECT:

JFK Assassination Review Records: Release of

InFormamen on fBi tavesigations of fareign dEficials

Establishments

(S) At your request, the Department of State has reviewed FBI

documents (attached list) relating to investigations of diplomatic

officials and

establishments.

(U) Solely from the standpoint of our bilateral relations the

Department of State has

no objection to release of the redacted

information pertaining to Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Former

Republic of Yugoslavia, Cuba, China, Yemen, Romania, and Hungary.

(S)

The

Department continues

to oppose

release of any

material including the non-redacted portions,

that would damage US

foreign

relations

by

revealing FBI collection of

information

involving

Israeli diplomatic personnel, other Israeli officials,

conducting

routine contacts with

Israelis.

We

believe that the government of Israel would react quickly and

negatively to the release of such material.

(S) With respect to the Dominican Republic, the Department

agrees with the FBI determination

that the redacted information

should not be released. There is a new government in the Dominican

Republic and acknowledgment that the US collected information as a

result of FBI investigation of foreign diplomats could cause that

government

substantial

embarrassment

hinder

sensitive negotiations on a range of issues important to the United

States government.
