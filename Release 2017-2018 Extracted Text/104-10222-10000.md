During the year, political shifts in Peru and Bolivia have served

to dramatize the danger of too extensive a reliance

has moved to reduce the profile of our L

The high morale in his Division comes from the widespread

knowledge that good performance is recognized and that career advance-

On policy matters, his judgment and advic is sought and relied

Our

position he distinguished himself. He was brought in to take over

the Wil Division when the Chief of that Division became the DD/ P.

That in itsell'was an eloquent admission of the esteom in which his

capabilities are held. His performance in the WH Division has fully

lived up to thia evaluation.

I have, therefore,
