Dear Mr. Laska:

We find we must ask your

assistance one more time in

connection with ten documents from CIA's microfilm files

responsive to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act of 1992. All ten are from a file

describing the work of the "President's Committee on the

Warren Report," a Cabinet-level committee set up to act on

the recommendations in the final report of the Warren

Commission. A primary focus of this committee--which

functioned from September to December 1964--was the Secret

Service.

Mr. David Van Tassel of the National Security Council

has indicated to us that the NSC will defer to your judgment

on the release of this material. CIA will pose no

objections to the declassification and release of all ten

David vau phia materia,

documents, so far as our equities are concerned. (We will

be coordinating four of these items with other agencies

concerned:

the seventh item with the FBI; the ninth with

the Department of State; land

I am sorry, but I could not leave well enough alone.

One of our reviewers has identified one more--possibly

final--document (two pages) from our microfilm records which

the Department should look at.

This

one is the minutes of

the 24 November 1964 meeting of President Johnson's cabinet-

level committee set up to act on the recommendations in the

Warren Commission's final report. We have sent a copy also

to the Secret Service. CIA has no objection to declassifi-

cation and release. David Van Tassel of the National

Security Council has indicated to us that he will defer to

* the judgment of State, the Secret Service, and CIA as to the

• release of this material. We don't believe this one will

give you much trouble.

Please again give us your recommendations.
