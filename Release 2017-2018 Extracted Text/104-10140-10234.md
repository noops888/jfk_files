12. (Unclassified - DEM) BRIEFING Mike Madigan, Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence staff, called to request a second briefing by

George Kalaris, C/CI Staff, on the Agency's counter-intelligence mission.

Kalaris wasn't able to finish his briefing on 3 November because of numeror

staff questions and Bill Miller, Staff Director, said at that time he would lil

to schedule another briefing. After checking with Kalaris, the briefing was

set up for 23 November at 9:30.

13. (Confidential- LLM) LIAISON In response to his previous

request, made arrangements with Alan Romberg, NSC staff, to read

the transcript of the briefing before the Subcommittee on Arms Control,

International Organizations and Security Agreements, Senate Foreign

Relations Committee.

14. (Unclassified - LLM) FAA ALERT Reached Ralph Preston,

House Appropriations Committee staff, at home and alerted him to the

fact there has been another Presidential finding.

15. (Unclassified - LLM) LIAISON Larry Callahan, Department o

Justice, called to determine our interest in collaborating with them on

drawing up the investigations standards for security standards of the

House Select Committee on Assassinations. I said I thought we would want

to apply the same standards that were followed in the case of the Senate

committees and Robert Gambino, D/Security, has been alerted to follow

through on this with Justice.

Little progress has been made on the security clearances and Calla

is quite certain that at least one and possibly two staffers known to him wo

not meet suitable standards of the Department of Justice.

Regarding the "Hoover memo," a decision is now pending in Justic

on showing it to Chairman Thomas N. Downing (D., Va.) and Representati

Samuel L. Devine (R., Ohio) on a "no notes

o be taken'' basis.

SA/DCI,

was advised.
