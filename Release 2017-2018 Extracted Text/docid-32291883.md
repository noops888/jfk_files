FELIX ANTHONY ALDERISIO

SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.

PAN AMERICAN BANK

OF MIAMI, FLORIDA - VICTIM

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN PROPERTY

MAIL FRAUD; INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION

IN AID OF RACKETEERING - EXTORTION

Assistant Attorney General Herbert J. Miller, Jr., Criminal

Division, has requested that subject Alderisio

be arrested

on the

morning of 10/9/63 by our Chicago, Illinois, Office on a warrant

obtained on 10/2/63 by our Miami, Florida, Office which charged

Alderisio with violating the Interstate Transportation in Aid of

Racketeering (ITAR) - Extortion Statute.

This warrant was issued

following the filing of a complaint, authorized by the Criminal Divisi

following the receipt of information by our Chicago Office indicating

Alderisio has a passport and is arranging his personal business so tha

he can leave the country.

The Criminal Division did not desire that

this warrant be served before this time because it expected that a

grand jury indictment would be returned shortly; however, it has now

been ascertained that there will be some additional delay in the retur

of such indictment and it is feared Alderisio may go through with his

plans to flee the county.

Alderisio, a well-known Chicago hoodlum. commonly referred

as "Milwaukee Phil,

" is an extremely close associate of top Ã©chelor

hoodlums in the Milwaukee and Chicago areas.

He is rumored to have

been a gunman for the old Capone gang.

The investigation on which

the complaint was based developed that Alderisio and subject Traffican

(a top hoodlum of our Tampa, Florida, Office) endeavored to "muscle in

on the profits of a "South American

deal" being operated by Sam Kay

(a Miami Beach shylock millionaire); Charles William Bray (Chicago

insurance broker); and James W. Egan (Denver, Colorado, banker).

early 1962, in Miami, Alderisio assaulted Egan and threatened Egan's

teen-age daughter with bodily harm unless he, Alderisio, was given

one-third of the profits of the "South American deal."

Interstate

travel for the purpose of committing extortion is a violation of the

ITAR Statute.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

Re:

Charles William Bray; et al.

Prosecution of Trafficante has not been authorized by the

Criminal Division as there is no indication he plans to flee the

country, and the evidence against him is not as clear-cut as that

against

Alderisio.

Bray will be used as a witness against Alderisio

and is now furnishing information in other Bureau investigations

involving Teamsters Union bonding programs.

It is noted that the complaint filed on 10/2/63 at Miami,

charging Alderisio with violating the ITAR - Extortion Statute,

alleged that Alderisio travelled from Chicago to Miami with intent

so an Statute contance

to commit an act of extortion against James W. Egan and in furtherance

of this to commit assault and battery on him. It alleges also that

on or about 3/9/62,

Alderisio carried out the latter intent by

assaulting Egan and further attempted to perform the unlawful act

of extortion by threatening to harm Egan's daughter.

The foregoing is-for your information.

Our Chicago Office

is being instructed to effect the arrest of Alderisio and contact

Assistant Director DeLoach's office, which has been supplied with

background data, when Alderisio is apprehended in order that an

appropriate press release can be made at Chicago.
