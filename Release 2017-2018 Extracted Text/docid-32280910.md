checked regarding VERA LIPOVATZ and her sister, HELEN

The DST files reflect that VERA LIPOVATZ,

also known as VERA DE LIPOVATZ, divorced from SCHMIDt,

According to the DST

records, she became a naturalized

Her daughter,

YOLANDE,is married

to PIERRE GIRAUD, a Frenchman, and as of 1954 resided at

45 rue de Lisbonne, Paris. In 1954 VERA LIPOVATZ resided

at 10 rue Blacas,

Nice, France, and Was known as an active

Yugoslav "Royalist"

, an anti-litoist, anti-communist,

active in Yugoslav anti-Communist emigre groups. The DST

files

contained no derogatory infornation regarding VERA

LIPOVATZ and no information to indicate that

she has been

involved in subversive activities in France. Likewise,

these files contained no information to confirm allegations

that HELEN YOURIEVITCH, sister of VERA LIPOVATZ, is involved

in subversive activities in France. Both VERA LIPOVATZ

She advised that she first met GEORGI

but not

too

frequently since he resided in Dallas, Texas, and

she resided in New York City.

two

occasions in the past twelve years.

These occasions were

duringelories visits of DE MOHRENSCHILDI to Paris.
