spotting and sabotage operations.

who was going to use these items in an assassination attempt against

Fidel CASTRO.

A-1 was involved in this plan. One of A-4's close friends was

one David UTIANSKY (AMFISH-1) 201-215877. UTIANSKY'S file shows that

the Agency considered him to be "a Soviet or an Israeli agent, or both."

In 1950 UTIANSKY was believed to be not only a Communist, but an official

delegate of the Russian Communist Party and was receiving his orders from

the Soviet Charge in Havana, Dimitri ZAIKIN. Again in 1961 a request for

Security Information (CIA) on UTIANSKY stated that the Havana files indicated

that one David UTIANSKY was/is a "militant Communist." In June 1963 WAVE 9575

(IN 56919)

dated 11 June 1963, reported information from AMҐURVY-4

and listed David UTIANSKY as the sub-source. In the cable UTIANSKY was

described as "old guard Communist funding agent of Cuban Communist

Party in the 30's and 40's, NOW SUSPECTED KGB AGENT!

On 6 November

(63?) a dispatch was sent from JMNAVE to the Chief, FID requesting

traces on UTIANSKY (see attached copy.)
