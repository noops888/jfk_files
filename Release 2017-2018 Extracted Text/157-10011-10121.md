EVENTS LEADING TO RECRUITMENT

Charles W. Wiley first came to the official atten-

tion of the Office of Security (OS) on 9 September 1955,

when

(executive Officer, OS) forwarded a

letter written by Wiley to Ermal Geiss (Chief, Personnel

Security

Division, OS), who in turn directed

the letter

to James W. McCord

[Security Research Staff of the Office

of Security (SRS)]:

How Heney obtained the Wiley letter

is unknown, inasmuch as the name of the addressee was

deleted in

the letter. However, the letter was recorded

in the Executive Registry under number

5-98S1. The Wiley

setter is dated 27 April 1955, gives Wiley's address and

telephone number, and Wiley advised that he was working

on an index of the Daily Worker for the years 1933-1945

"and

thought that

perhaps you might be interested in

specific information that I am likely to find."

On 10 September 1955, James W. McCord contacted Wiley

1945, by stating that he was preparing the index under a

grant from the American Legion Anericanism Committee,

headed " Lee Pennington (a former employee of the FBI).

Wiley started the index in November 1954.

Wiley stated

he contacted the major government agencies in Washington

to ascertain what information in

the Daily Worker would

be of most interest to them, and in addition,

contacted

a couple of Congressional Committees which McCord

surmised

were the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the

Senate Internal Security Committee. Wiley estimated it

would take two and a half years to complete the index.

that time, Wiley was

receiving part-time clerical assis-

tance from

the Women's Auxiliary of the American Legion

Post in Flushing, New York.

Wiley also indicated an in-

terest in Agency employment after

finishing the index.

The results of McCord's interview with Wiley were

brought to the attention of Robert Bannerman, Deputy Direc-

tor of security, by 21 November 1955, when Bannerman opined

that "this may be valuable."

Mecord met next wich wiley in washingtontine, wiley

had indexed 150,000 names of the Daily Worker covering

January 1934 through June 1936.

Wiley stated that the

New York City and the American Legion were already

making

"extensive use"

of the index cards.

Wiley stated

that one of his purposes being

in Washington was

to secure

financing for the index continuation. He stated

that his

$5000 a year grant from the American Legion Americanism

Committee would expire at the end of December 1955,

and

it negotiations with that body were unsuccessful, he would

attempt to secure financing from the Senate and House Invas-

tigating Committees.

Wiley stated that the FBI has indi-

cated the strongest desire that he continue the indexing

but that in his discussion with Mr. DeLoach (Cartha Deloach,

an FBI senior official), no indication of forthcoming finan-

cial support from the Bureau for this work was indicated.

In recording this contact with Wiley, McCord opined:

"I think it is obvious that the index

which Wiley is working

on would be of con-

siderabie

value iù tho

Security Ottire and

to CIA, particularly

since the Communist

Party membership and

activities during the

1934-40 period were for the most part very

open and

extensively advertised in the Daily

Worker.

An example of how open their activi-

were is indicated in the fact that

Elizabeth Bentley's name was mentioned

a 1935 issue of the Daily Worker at a time

prior

to her going underground and acquiring

RIS (Russian Intelligence Service) mission.

If the Daily worker thus

bears a record of

(Communist Party activities of an indi-

vidual such as Bentley, who later became

so prominent in RIS activities in the

United

States, then the possibility always

xists that the names of nersons later con-

nected with OSS (Office of Strategic Services)

and other governmental

activity may also be

mentioned in the 1934-40 Daily Worker issues,

which have heretofore never been indexed by

any government agency.

"Because of the obvious value of

having access to such an

index, the writer

(McCord) recommends that

we encourage the

continuation of Wiley's index project in

any way in which we are able to further

such work."

(There is no objective evidence in the file other than

the above to support Wiley's contention that he was given

encouragement by Mr. DeLoach of the FBI to continue the pro-

ject.)

The above was brought to the attention of

I (Chief,

Counterintelligence Branch, SRS),

who

in turn brought

the matter to the attention of Colonel

Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security, circa early

December 1955.

Via a memorandum dated 19 December 1955, McCord

informed

of the receipt of additional

correspon

dence from Wiley,

and McCord incluaud a rehash

of the

metter including

statements:

"I hope the Office of Security

can

encourage the continuation of the

project, at

least until

the index is

completed up through 1940, which would

take about another year of work by wiley.

The index has considerable potential CE

(counter espionage) value to this Office,

for one

thing, by virtue of the fact that

there will be numerous heretofore unidenti-

fied Communists' names turn up in the

index, some of whom went underground

during the World War II jears.

The

index may give us the one clue neces-

sary to detect any

such penetration

existing within this Agency.

The value

in protecting the Agency thereby is of

course inestimable.

The continuation

of the project would have other

merits,

which we have discussed previously."

NcCord also reconnended that, should the project fail,

the Asley consider employing wiley.

McCord recommended that Wiley had a personal acquain-

key functionaries, such as Louls Budenz,

as well as a

personal

acquaintance with the

heads and

research people

in all of the Federal Congressional Committees, and State

Investigating Committees in New York State.

McCord was next in contact with Wiley on 27 December

1955, receiving an account of pertinent points retrieved

by Wiley fron the indexing project. In addition, Wiley

stated he had discussed the indexing project with Herbert

was in contact with Wittfogal a few weeks before.

As a result, McCord scheduled National Agency Checks in

On 17 January 1956, McCord informed _

his OK,

that Wiley intended to place an

asking for figures as to cost.

McCord was next in direct contact with Wiley in Flushing,

Yew York, on 29 January 1956, obtaining highlights of security

interest

developed from the indexing.

By 6 February 1956, figures were produced showing that

$13,500 would cover one year continuation of the indexing,

$7,000 for Wiley, $3,000 for a clerk typist; and $3,000

for

part-time help and supplies:

On this date, Gaynor noted he

"would like to

see this project completed if at all possible."

By the first week of March 1956, "front office" verbal

approval had been given for OS funding of the project, labeled

Operation Recall, concurrent with a meeting between McCord

and Wiley and arrangements were made for transporting

the

completed

portion of the index to Washington, D. C. McCord

estimated

the value of the index at that time as being be-

tween $15,000 to $25,000 in labor alone.

favorable National Agency Name Checks were concluded on Wiley

and Colonel Edwards

and Colonel White had approved using

Security Office funds to total

It was made clear to Wiley that CIA was pur-

his sources of information in New York City - keeping the

• On or about 1 April 1960, the House Committee on

with Wiley based on articles by Wiley appearing in the

Anerican Legion Magazine, Elks magazine, National Review,

and the Ukranian Quarterly, apparently based on Wiley's

observations of Iron Curtain countries derived from his

travels to the USSR,

the World Youth

CUBA TRIP, ARREST AND DETENTION, 1960

On 9 August 1960, Wiley reported the following infor-

mation to

_Of SRS concerning his trip to Cuba:

approximately 7:00 p.n. on the evening of 27 July 1960.

During the period between his arrival and his arrest,

Wiley stated that he had made no business type contacts

and that he had merely wandered about the streets of Havana

(Wiley is covered as a correspon-

dent for radio station WOR of New York City plus other news-

paper correspondent type coverage.) During this period,'

Wiley stated he contacted Ruby Phillips of the New York

Times and he met and

talked with Dave Webber, a stringer

For NBC who was staying at the Libre Hotel.

In addition,

Wiley stated that he had spent a certain amount of time

doing nothing but moving about the Libre Hotel. Wiley

stated further that during the

2oth and on the 27th he

had been interviewing delegates to the Latin American

Youth Congress then convening in Havana, Cuba.

During

these interviews, Wiley had acted as a

typical newspaper-

man and had with

him a tape recorder which he had brought

with hin when he came into Clibe and which he had previously

registered with the Cuban customs authorities.

Wiley stated that the actual arrest came about in the

following way.

He stated that he had talked with a young

man

from the United States.

the young cuban who was obvi-

ously violently pro-Castro

and also had talked with a young

man from the United States.

The young Cuban had been telling

that it was not

a police state and he was conducting his discussion with

this young Cuban in more or less routine reported style

when all of a sudden a police officer with to others moved

to the table where he was sitting and stated that they wanted

to talk to Wiley outside.

Wiley asked the

ranking officer

who he was and was told

that he was the Chief of the Public

Relations of the Youth Congress. However, after some argu-

Miley was forcibly taken outside although not roughed

and taken

directly to G-2 Headquarters in the Miromar Section of

Havana which is a building between 14th Street and Fifth

Avisit ind board the number 121t Cohls address known

the United States Embassy). Wiley stated that during the

ride in the car to the G-2 Headquarters, he needled the

young. Cuban who kept insisting that this was not an arrest

seemed shocked by the whole performance.

Wiley added

that this Cuban, as far as he knows, was dismissed

the prison after

a statement had been taken from him by

the police the same evening.

Wiley stated that he was taken to a reception type of

room in the G-2 Headquarters and

to his complete amaze-

ment some fifteen minutes after he was taken there, into

the reception room came Jake Rosen, a well known New York

Communist whom Wiley spoke to and positively identified

another U.S. Communist whom Wiley identified as being

one of those who was on

tour of the Soviet Union with

Wiley after he had gone to the Vienna Youth Festival pre-

viously. Wiley stated that he could not recall

covered with mud and he learned later from one of the

guards in the reception room that both of these men had

come from Sierra Maestre where they had been visiting.

Wiley said he talked to Rosen and there could be no

question of his identity. NOtE:

In discussing the iden-

tity of these individuals with wiley, it was agreed that a

possible examination of both cases would be in order since

a possibility exists that Rosen

and the other Communist

were illegally in Cuba.)

Following this short period of time in the reception

room, Wiley was placed in a cell in the jail about 9x 15

feet

long which contained six bunks and 15 other prisoners.

Wiley stated that in this cell he met FNU Acosta, a man

named Costas and Major Gallo Martinez whom Wiley

• described

as the former Adjutant General of Castro's Army.

Wiley stated that after about one hour in

the cell,

the guards came and took hin to another room for interro-

gation. On the way to the interrogation room, Wiley stated

he saw

Jake Rosen

and the other aforementioned man

iri nna

of the inner offices and both seemed

in high spiriis.

Wiley commented that he had

learned later from other pri-

sonsers that Rosen and this other individual had complete

run of the Headquarters and were allowed to make phone cals

and Wiley stated that he established through other prisoners

that Rosen had made at least three phone calls; one to the

National Hotel, one possibly to the United States Embassy

and one to an unknown private number. Wiley also learned

that at one of the three numbers Rosen spoke to someone

for about

an hour and apparently this someone was known

as "Mike."

Wiley stated that he also learned that the two

Communists were seen with Captain Alvarez of G-2 and were

observed on most friendly terms with Alvarez and were, in

fact, reported as being arm in arm with Alvarez. One pri-

soner believed that they were talking about Wiley since

this prisoner overheard

the name "Cholly" (ph), the way

Cubans referred to Wiley's first name Charles.

According to Wiley, the interrogation was conducted

by the previously mentioned Alvarez and a Cuban woman who

claimed that she had been arrested by the FBI recently in

; Miami, Florida, and further claimed that she had been

slapped by an FBI agent.

Wiley stated that this woman

mentioned

the name of the man but he cannot as

yet recall

the agent's name.

Wiley also believed that the

arrest had

occurred in Miami within the last few months, also no speci-

fic date of arrest was mentioned. Wiley stated that Alvarez

and

the woman both spoke English although not well.

Wiley stated that the interrogation was strictly rou-

tine.

They wanted to know why he was in Cuba, when he had

arrived, had he ever been in Cuba before, who

he worked

for, etc.

Wiley

stated that he worked for radio station

WOR

and that

he held strictly to his newspaper correspon

dent cover

Wiley stated that Alvarez attempted to talk

tough at times but wiley laughed at him and denounced the

Cuban police, the Cuban military and the Cuban government

to Alvarez and, in fact, invited

Alvarez to do anything

he wanted to.

Wiley stated he bluntly asked Alvarez just

why he was arrested

and according to Alvarez said "we

think you are an FBI spy."

Wiley stated that he pointed

out the stupidity of Alvarez to his face and that Alvarez

from time to time became furious during the interrogation.

Wiley stated that the interrogation which was com-

pletely fruitless lasted about twenty minutes, at the

conclusion of which he was given a sandwich and was told

that he would be released in the morning.

Wiley stated

that he demanded that he be allowed to call the U.S. Em-

bassy but this was denied.

Because of this, Wiley stated

that he wouldn't eat a

thing until the U.s.

Embassy or

one of their representatives had

made contact with him.

He stated that he took the sandwich and gave it to some

prisoners.

Wiley stated at

the conclusion of this interro-

gation he was taken to a different cell which he described

Wiley stated that there was no other attempt at

interrogation made either

directly of indirectly during

his stay.. He stated that

on Saturday night an official

from the

U.S. Embassy visited him.

Wiley did not know

this man's name and Mr. Kessler from the Embassy who has

been previously mentioned visited him Monday,

Tuesday and

Wednesday.

Wiley commented

that prior to his

release he

gave what he regarded

as significant information (which

will be referred to in the

second section of this report

to kessler, since he thought the information should be

surfaced and he could not tell how long he would be kept

in the prison. Wiley cautioned the writer at this time

the possible compromise of his connections if this infor-

nation was handled incorrectly.

Wiley stated that he suffered

no particular harass-

ments while in the prison.

He stated that some of the

guards talked tough and tried to act tough but Wiley stated

he behaved in his completely stubborn and obstreperous man-

ner at all times and refused

to cooperate in every possible

way.

He stated that the regular prison guards were friendly

and

he had no trouble with them but the special military

guards and the army ryne were tne constanc subieuis of his

scorn and hostility.

He stated that as a form

of annoy-

ance he was told twice that

he was going to leave and then

after he had prepared to leave, he was told that it was a

mistake and that his leaving had been cancelled.

Wiley stated that on Friday or Saturday in the morning

which had been the 29th or 30th of July he was checked over

by a doctor at the prison for fungus infection and because

of the fact that he was on a hunger strike and that it was

obvious that he was weak from hunger, Wiley said nothing

cane of this but on Tuesday the 2nd of August, he was taken

within the prison to a doctor who immediately sent him to

a hospital, address unknown (in Havana), Camp Libertad.

At this hospital Wiley was given a check up and he was

told

he would have

to eat.

Wiley stated that he would resist

any effort to force feed him and he refused to take any

food and any medication from a Cuban doctor or Cuban atten-

dant.

Wiley said that at the hospital he was placed in a

psycho cell with about twelve persons some of whom Wiley

thought were

political types but most of whom were criminally

because of his

refusal to eat and he was constantly being

checked by various doctors.

stated that he was re-

leased from the hospital and was given back all of his

effects except his tape

recorder and his hat.

Wednes-

day, 3 August, he was released.

Wiley commented that the individuals who were political

prisoners impressed him very much; they seemed "real men"

and were fanatically anti-Castro; most as far as Wiley could

tell were connected with the MRR.

He stated the regular

guards were obnoxious and were detested by the prisoners.

He commented that the G-2 Headquarters, as far as he could

tell, had been in operation somewhat over two months and

that they had

probably processed over 5,000 prisoners

since he

recalled seeing the number attached

to his card

as 5028.

Wiley commented that while at the hospital a civil

officer, Rolando Fiallo,

came to his cell and acted as

interpreter. Fiallo told Wiley that he wanted to help him

and nffarad

to an anything for him that

he could.

Fiallo told Wiley that he had a good friend who was an

important defector from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

Wiley commented that Fiallo sounded very honest but that

he could not tell whether this man was a plant or not.

Wiley stated that while he was in prison, guards

brought in a man by the name of Leonardo Julio Walter,

Argentine doctor.

Valter was an obnoxious type, according to Wiley, and

North Americans and

in no circumstances would he treat

them medically. Wiley could not understand why this man

was brought into the prison but reported it simply as an

incident of interest.

Set out below are items of particular interest which

have been reported in more specific terms by Mr. Wiley

to assist Chief, SRS and are

set forth below for record:

Wiley reported that MRR source who was interrogated

said that a man FNU Gorky was a Russian or East German

in on all interrogations of political

prisoners

at the G-2 Headquarters Building,

According

to miley,

this man does not speak Spanish

and his source could fur-

nish no description.

According to Wiley, an MR source told him that he

had received the

following information from another MRY

man who worked at the place mentioned.

This source re-

ported that there were twenty crated MIG fighter planes

at the San Antonio "bath" (Wiley could not

recall the

Spanish word used here). This source stated

that this

was an air base built by the U.S. Government.

The source

further reported that he had heard that between 50 and

35

Cuban pilots were presently in Czechoslovakia on

a seven

months training course getting instructions for flying

the aforementioned MIG fighters.

• Wiley stated that he had given full details concerning

the Soviet freighter that had come in with the large crates

to Assistant Chief,

SRS.

Wiley stated that it was most

interesting that his source told him that the freighter

had come

through Cuban customs and into the harbor without

any routine harbor clearance and had swung immediately into

its berth along side one of the Havana docks.

According to

Wiley the source was one of the longshoremen who had been

impressed to unload this Soviet freighter. The crates un-

loaded were enormous being 70 feet long approximately.

Source also stated that one of the crates had broken but

because of the careful packing of whatever it contained,

source was unable to identify its contents. According to

Wiley, these huge crates were placed on big trucks and

were

taken

to specific

areas, each one accompanied by 'jeeps.

Wiley himself could offer no explanation of the

crates

what they were made of nor the size or capacity of the trucks

that noved these large

crates.

Apparently Wiley's source

could furnish no additional details other than those given

to Assistant Chief, SRS.

Wiley stated that he learned from a former police-

man who served under Batista that every G-2 station in

Havana had cached 400 Czech machine guns and approximately

two million rounds of ammunition.

Source told Wiley that

he knew this to be true because he had worked putting these

items there. Wiley himself definitely discounts this story.

Wiley reported that a source had obtained from another

source who worked at this place

that there were 200 Russian

or East German (European) technicians at the Baracoa (ph)

base.

Wiley reported that he had received information that

that they had in prison the head of the sabotage group,

the head of the Activist grown and the Chief of Finance

of the vira muvement in ravand. Miiey sidied that he gui

that

were leaders of one of the two major sections of the MRR in

Havana.

that it would be impossible to bring a big group to

attitude of the Moroccan government.

A 21 June 1965 memo from Wiley reflects the status

of his fund raising activities

for the 9th WYF project

and some data regarding the project.

Funds raised to

that date were some $1,485 or more under auspices of

"Christianform, Inc."

Wiley said the goal is to send

6 delegates, 5 young men and a girl with a

seventh

person

in Algiers outside the delegation.

He will take

no active part in the project than to keep in touch

through the coordinator outside the delegation. Among

other

things,

each delegate is to get as much information

as possible about the U.S. delegation, including photos.

On return, all information on domestic leftists will be

given to

the FBI directly by the delegates.

Wiley said

there is good hope that the projected budget of $3,000

will be fulfilled and that none

of the money raised for

this arniert will be used

They

will ve covered by the cover Organization earnings.

Although the WYF was belatedly cancelled in late

June, Wiley did follow through with the So. American

phase of his planned travel.

SOUTH AMERICAN TRIP - SUMMER 1965

Notes in early July 1965 indicate Wiley was planning

a trip also to South America. There is indication he

was to be in Washington, D.C., for SRS consultation on

12, 13 and 14 July 1965.

Sometime in July 1965, Wiley prepared a memorandum

which he captioned "Re: Proposed South American

July 1965."

He suggested private financing and gave his

targets as

the political and military situation

especially Castro/Communist influence and insurgency war

danger.

There are notes of discussion with Wiley on 15, 20

In July 1965,

received information from

Wiley concerning his contacts with the American Security

Council (ASC)

and a mid-West speaking trip during the

period 24 May to 1 June 1965.

The latter trip, according

to Wiley, was paid for by the Young Americans

for Freedom.

Regarding his contacts with the American Security Council,

Wiley advised:

"My contact with ASC goes back to the

middle 1950's when I first met John Fisher.

At that time he was setting up the organization

based on Harry Jung's files.

Before it was

named ASC, the org, was the Mid-American

Research Library, and, later, Fidelifax.

(Perhaps vise versa).

"Over the years I've been in touch with

ASC frequently.

In addition to Fisher, I know

Jack: Ison

and Bill Lambie - both former rii

men who worked on the subversive desk in New

York (and elsewhere?). Ison left ASC in 1962

to join the

Hoover Co., Canton,

Ohio.

My

last information is that he was

in their White

Plains, N.Y. office.

Another man in the Chicago

office whom I met was D. Alspaugh, a research

specialist.. I have no knowledge of his back-

ground.

"In the Washington Office, I know Lee: Pennington

a friend for years before he joined ASC.

While he was

in Washington, I also knew Frank Johnson (a former ONI

man?). I believe he is presently in Europe.

"My first contact with Dewitt Copp was in the fall

of 1964.

(NOTE: During my conversation with Copp he

told me that the Chinese Air Force U-2 Flights were tied

in with CIA).

I spoke to him about my trip to Asia

because of his having been in the area and to obtain

outlets for material. Copp was in close touch with

the Chinese Embassy, and I think it was Frank Toa who

My only other contact was a phone talk with him

"While in Taivan I was told by Col. Caithness

and that it was not deliberate.

During my. March pnone

"On March 16 I had dinner with John Lewis in New

Wiley is characterized as a free lance

journalist, and an authority on International Communism

who covered wars in Katanga, New Guinea, Laos, Vietnam,

Algeria and Angola.

In early 1966, Wiley provided adverse information

_ on Fred Coldren, Executive Director, International Federation

for Freedom, Inc.

the World Youth Festival in Moscow.

In early 1966, Wiley prepared reports concerning

_ Vladimir G. and Emma Treml; Dr. and Mrs. Ivan D. London,

- Christopher Emmet, William Pawley, William T. McConarty,

MI. (FNU) Aistrop, Mr. (FNU) Eng, and Jay Kennedy.

In February 1966, Wiley prepared a report concerning

while discussing an article on Soviet spies.

There are handwritten

notes of contacts with Wiley

on 19 and 21 April 1966 mainly concerning articles

about

CIA which appeared in the May 1966 issue of "Esquire."

Wiley did not know the authors. After apparent approval

by the Director of Security, Wiley was authorized to

contact one (Fnu) Erickson of "Esquire" to determine

the identity of the authors.

There are notes of a verbal report by Wiley dated

27 April 1966 concerning Alex Roark.

In March 1966, Wiley prepared a report captioned,

Apparently Butler had a

radio debate with Lee

In late 1966 or early 1967, Wiley submitted a number

attendant to the production

of the films, "Troublemakers," "Mass," etc.

In early 1967, Wiley prepared a report concerning

Vladimir G. and Emma Treml based on a personal letter:

and concurrently a report on Dr. and Mrs. Ivan D. London.

Circa November 1966. Wiley prepared a report con-

cerning

Arlington House Publishers was the subject of a

cusses the factional fight to control the publishing

company.

In March 1967, Wiley prepared a report which he

captioned,

"D.C. Reaction to Exposure of CIA Cover

Operations."

It would appear that the majority of the

information came from Nick Nonnenmacher, administrative

assistant to Rep. Henry C. Shadeburg.

Circa March 1967, Wiley forwarded three brochures

distributed by the Canadian

Loyalist Movement which were

mailed to Wiley (?) by F.C. Pilkington, North Vancouver,

B.C., Canada.

An undated

report, captioned, "Edward (Ted) Scott"

is based presumably on information provided to Wiley by

for operations and to increase his journalistic repu-

tation, it was

decided

that he would set up a news

gathering service based in New York City and secure,

where possible, the services of writers of journalists

who would feed him news stories from various points in

the world. This would have the advantage of being a

legitimate news-gathering service and at the same time

possibly being later used as an information-gathering

organization for intelligence purposes. Acting under

Instructions from SRS, Mr. Wiley set in motion the

(Apparently the summary and status report and Contact

_refers is the previous quoted memo

of 9 January.)

During February and March 1963, SRS representatives met

with Wiley for discussion of an objective to place a

skilled

and controlled source in the newspaper community in Washington,

D. C. who would have normal, routine,

and ready access to the

Washington writing and radio colony.

The long range plan was

to have Wiley move to Washington, and begin extensive writing

and lecturing to establish his prestige, and to slowly cur-

tail his other activities except for keeping his "excellent.

Cuban and anti-Castro connections." The basic plan was

forwarded to the Director of Security by the Chief, SRS, for.

consideration.

Tentative approval nust have been received

inasmuch as on 26 March 1964,

_requested the

ment of Wiley's work, and the best method for establishing

prestige for a writer.

The plan, as follows, was presented in an undated mano-

"During the week of February_

8 March 1963, extensive discussions were held with

Wiley concerning matters which are set out in de-

posed plan which follows is the most sound, logical,

and secure method of obtaining the desired results:

income adequate to be in Washington (ostensibly

from his own efforts); he must have a valid

rea-

son for being in Washington; he must have high

capacity to produce: he must have a strong secu

rity sense; and he must have unquestioned loyalty.

"PROPOSED SOLUTION:

"a. SOURCE - Source to be used is Wiley. Wiley

fits in nearly every particular to the elements set

out in the 'Problem' above.

"b. METHOD OF SOLUTION:

"1.

Source will begin at once to write

, articles of importance, aiming at the placing

of these

articles in national

magazines, partie-

ularly magazines of the type of Life, Look,

Readers Digest, McCalls, Argosy, etc.

Source

has

numerous valid ideas for these articles and

already some interest has been shown

in these

writings by Editors of the aforementioned type

magazines.

Source will slowly divorce nimself

from his

numerous activities in New York City,

maintaining only strong

interest in his cuban

connections.

Source will need approximately

three months to write these articles and to sell

them.

It is Source's

intention that these articles

carry his by-line, which is a basic element to

building prestige necessary for Source's future

activity.

Source is convinced he can handle this

successfully.

"Note: Heretofore Source has, under instruction,

Kept the use of his name to an absolute minimum for

obvious reasons. This requirement will now be

lifted.

This

lecture tour, details of which will be set

is considered of key importance

to the basic problem.

sorter/writer/photographer, using his credentials

will be provided using numerous Cuban contacts

Source has obtained throughout Latin and South

American countries. This trip will take probably

the most of July, August, and part of Septembei

and is regarded as essential for back up, toI

prestige, for area knowledge, and for lecture

material.

"Note:

(It should be noted

that there is no lecture

activity during the Summer months.) After pre-

paration, Source will proceed to make a lecture

tour covering all parts of the United States and

addressing all types of audiences.

Source's

lecture tour will be run through the sponsorship of

the Babcock Agency of Virginia Beach, Virginia.

This

Agency, which handles among

others the important

members of the National Review Staff, will be

handled on a direct commission basis

taking a usual

ten percent fee.

In addition, through other organi-

zations Source will arrange lectures on his own which

is routine and

which will not conflict in any way

with the Babcock Agency interest. Source antici-

pates completing the lecture tour about the first

of the year 1964, at which time he will return to

New York City.

Source (spreadhis name before the public),

it will give him the necessary oppor-

tunity to conduct

the following business:

As Source makes his lecture tour he will

attempt, by direct contact and through al-

ready established channels, to determine

whether or not he can set up for the basic

plan (a) a daily column, (b) a newsletter,

(c) a radio spot news broadcast.

The lecture

tour, of course, will place Source in given

areas and it would be completely logical for

him to talk to local editors and radio station

owners and managers

while in the area.

He will

be backed up by the fact that he is lecturing

and that he is a writer because of the pre-

viously mentioned articles.

"d.

Upon his return to New York City on or about

the first of the year 1964, Source will then be

able to make a definitive statement as to whether

or not he can conduct on a continuing basis and

on an economically sound basis (a) a daily column;

(b) a weekly newsletter; or (c) a radio newscast

short newscasts which he believes can be peddled

on a spot basis to various local radio chains,

perhaps weekly. This idea, which is novel, ap-

After Source and SRS staff have had a chance

to analyze the total result?

a decision will then

be reached as to the feasibility of moving Source

to Washington.

If the results of the above set

out plans indicate that Source can logically appear

in Washington, he will then, for a period of about

30 to 60 days while operating either his column,

newsletter or radio broadcast bureau, shuttle back

and forth between New York and Washington obviously

seeking news.

He will let it be known to his friends

in the newspaper and writing business that the pres-

sure of his work is such that he will need some

office space in Washington at which time, more or

less on a temporary basis, he will secure in a

"E. After this test, Source will 'discover' that

"he can best operate out of Washington and he will

then establish an office and purchase a house or

other accommodations and bring his family to Wash-

"g. At this point Source will be operating on

his own as a news gatherer.

He will be established

as such and he will have access to the various

press conferences and other news making areas in

Washington and he will by necessity mingle with

the local newsmen and radio people.

that would cover the movement of the Source into

Washington, explain his presence there, and give

him a required freedom of movement in the area of

interest. We have no totally controlled newspaper

property, news bureau, or radio bureau in Washing-

ton, nor do we have any organization where Source

could be planted without creating a questionable

situation.

''4.

Could Source obtain employment on a

Congressional Committee on either side of the

Hill which would give him access to the areas

of interest?

"Source has exceptional connections on the

Hill and it is believed that through these con-

nections he might obtain some type of assign-

ment on a temporary basis or perhaps on a

regular

basis.

However, in the opinion of the SRS staff

this is exceptionally hazardous

and if it became

known through

some misfortune, it would be of

enormous embarrassment to Agency officials.

In

addition, Source might well obtain employment

with the

Congressional Committee, but his work

might be too limiting to permit him to move about

and it might well preclude any opportunity he had

of making contact with the local press.

Further-

more, most Committee assignments, investigative or

otherwise, generally follow a 9 to 5 routine on

the Hill and free lancing and freedom of movement

are not easily obtained

in Congressional Committees.

It is regarded as impossible to place Source on a

Congressional Committee if the employing Senator

or congressman was to be informer

even in a most

nominal way

of Scurce's mission.

"5.

Can

the basic plan be telescoped on a

shorter basis?

"This is considered questionable by those

who have worked in this area for some time. If

we shorten the approach, we would obviously cut

down on our Source's background and prestige,

particularly in an

area where stature is neces-

sary. The articles using Source's by-line, if

they are successful, would be very important and

would serve as a basis for everything that would

follow. The South American trip is needed and

Source would have at the present time the best

possible chance for success based on his Cuban

contacts which are very strong at the present

time.

A possibility also exists on such a trip

that Source might.be fortunate enough to achieve

an important newspaper scoop which, of course,

would build prestige and quite conceivably place

Circa

2 June 1967, Wiley prepared a report which he

lining an

effort to further the "Parade" concept.

On 15 June 1967, I

that this is

CHARLES WILEY'S CONTACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS

WITH

JANES MCCORD,

I, DONALD SWEANY AND HOWARD HUNT

:

JAMES MCCORD

James McCord was the first representative

'of the Office

of Security to have contact with Wiley and was undoubtedly

the driving force behind the Agency's funding of the Daily

Worker index.

McCord was Wiley's primary case officer from

1956 through January 1962 and during this period, guided and

was more or less

responsible for Wiley's direction and con-

trol.

The nature of McCord's contacts with Wiley after 1962

are not exactly known since McCord left SRS in January 1962

for other positions within the Office of Security:

The files

do, however, contain the following information which indicate

some contact between McCord and Wiley after 1969. The exact

nature of these contacts is not definitely known, especially

those in May - June 1969; however, the presumption is that

Wiley at the direction of McCord may have reported on and

photographed anti-Viet Nam War demonstrations in

Washington,

during that period and gave the

statement:

On 28 June 1972, Wiley telephoned

SRS and remarked that he, Wiley, was really surprised at

the depth the FBI must be covering this, l.e., watergate,

as he had already been approached and interviewed by a

couple of FBI agents based on several long distance calls

have a close association with

without elaborating

as to specific details.

For example: On March

1967, WILeY

prepared a report which states as follows - "In dealing with

Don (Sweaney) andL

_both of whom know of my

connection,

I avoid any talk of my company activities.

At one time, both knew some of my work because we received

cooperation

from them on certain projects.

However, since

Don went to his present job there has

been little contact.

I talk to Don as I do to everyone else. I ignore any

questions or statements with double meanings, surreptitious

alances,

etc.

This is because of two reasons - need-to-know

"Since the recent exposure of company activities is

'expert'

on one of the projects,

there is little way of avoiding the subject without arousing

suspicion.

with qualifications - regarding the area of

Under the circumstances, it would be quite

impossibie to take any other position.

not to

since 1954. Other than Wiley's comment concerningl

and Sweany, previously mentioned, there is

nothing else

from Wiley concerning Sweany.

HOWARD HUNT

There is nothing in the Wiley files to indicate any

contact or association with Howard Hunt.

Sometime prior to

and

"Give Us This Day,

"which was circulating amongst some New

York publishers none of whom wished to publish it because

of its controversial nature, l.e. Bay of Pigs operation.

The writer of the manuscript was later identified as Howard

Hunt.

The exact details

concerning this incident are not

available in the Wiley

files.

Further on this theme, on 19 June 1973, Wiley called

Louis Vasaly of SRS to say that he had in his hands a copy

of Howard Hunt's manuscript "Give Us This Day." Wiley was

advised that he had probably forgotten but that we had had

access to it several years ago when Hunt submitted it to

a difieieni publishei.

(Wiley roportodly had made it

available

at that

time). Wiley said that he believed that

this publisher was going to take advantage of the recent

publicity (meaning Watergate apparently)

and, of course,

bring it out under Hunt's

true name.

Wiley was told that

we (SRS) had no interest in his copy and that he could

return it to the contact who made it available to him.

There was no further discussion on the matter.

The above is the extent of references to Howard Hunt

in the Wiley files.
