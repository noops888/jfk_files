The letter from LOWELL BRIDWELI stated in part, "My

interest in FRANK

NONVERSE and his operating engineers was in

connection with the construction industry - primarily highwa

construction.

"In my opinion,

CONVERSE has been and still is the

enforcing arm. of an organization which has very strong control

of practically all big construction programs in the Cleveland

Metropolitan area, including who gets the contract, where the

contractor buys his materials, how much he pays for them, etc.

"Contractors in the Cleveland area are forced to go

along with this program on the threat of having wildcat strikes

by the operating engineers or TRISCARO's dump truck drivers.

They also are threatened with sabotage and general labor unrest.

"This organization, which is headed by ERNEST GREEN

of Cleveland, exercises control over construction projects in

Cuyahoga County, all of Geauga County, and parts of Summit,

Medina, and Lorain Countiês...

"I first ran across this situation when specifica-

tions were switched suddenly on a project to widen and rebuild

Route 42 on the outskirts of Cleveland in connection with an

Ohio Turnpike Interchange.

"At the time, I think it was

about 1953 or 1954, the

Columbia Southern Chemical Corporation,

a Barberton, Ohio,

subsidiary of Pittsburgh Plate Glass, had an overload of mater-

lal it produces as a

byproductand can be used as aggragate,

interchangeably with regular limestone or slag. In this pro-

ject, specifications called for slag, but were switched to

Columbia's byproduct at an extra cost to the contractor.

He

kicked up a

fuss because, this meant his profits on the job were

cut substantially. His name is RAY SCHLOSS of the

Asphalt Paving Company.

"I talked with SCHLOSS from Columbus by telephone,

and he told me he was so angry he was willing to tell the

whole story on how the organization operated. I immediately

drove to Cleveland, but by the time I arrived some four hours

later, he changed his mind and refused to even talk with me."
