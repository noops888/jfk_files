Arn 21 9 27 AM '67.

Since his assignment to Headquarters Training Branch of the Operations

School, I

has been principally engaged ina thorough study and revier

of all courses in Covert Action previously given in OTA.

This has been a long

and complicated job, the difficulty of which has been compounded by the neceseity,

at least in part through public eventa, to plan and project a total revision of

instruction in the CA field. As a result,

has not yet had the opportunity

" This will come shortly, however, when J new course beging on & May.

The "Strong" rating given him here ie based on the excellent work and thoroughly

profeasional approach he has taken in all of the preparatory work he has under-

taken. He has been eminently succesaful in establishing usoful new relationships

and in maintaining his old contacts in the Clandestine Services for the purpose of

laying's solid groundwork for high quality training. In addition to his responsi

bilities in OTR he has been regularly consulted

in a survey of

one of its activitics..

This te fine testimony for the regard in which he is held-

outside the confines of his present job. The prognosis for very effective

performance in all of his teaching assignments is exccllent." He has no supor-

visory sosponsibilities and is average in cost consciousness.

DY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

From

fairly close observation of his work I agrec

gencrably with

ratings and comments of supervisor.

The rating of

"outstanding" on

his work

was justified in his last report

because of the

exceptional Job he had done in developing this relationship.

While

he has continued to maintain it at a high

level, there

is

some question

in my mind whether a rating of "outstanding" is

still justified.

1. The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding

employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate

data on all personnel.

The new system will aid in implementing Agency

policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selcction of personnel

with desired education and experience for vaçancies which may occur. It-

is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistics

for planning and management purposes.

2. The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those

factors in which the Agency is intercuted.

Although the information is, in

a large measure, already reflected in previous forms submitled by you, it

is felt that your time within the organization may enable you to emphasize

those qualifications pertinent to its needs. The questionnaire also serves

to bring your education and qualifications record up to daic.

3. Your cooperation is

requested in completing the questioonaire as

thoroughly and accurately as possible and returning it to your Administrative

Officer within the time allotted. "
