Dear Mr. Innes:

Re:

Joseph VALACHI

As pointed out in our phone conversation

of this morning, I have read with interest the

recent publicity given to the VALACHI case.

20

The disclosures made through this

criminal apparently have provided a real insight

into U.S. criminal syndicate operations and

leaders. I am wondering if any information

this type was obtained touching either directly

or indirectly on the Canadian scene.

3.

any information you may be in a position

tO

supply would be most appreciated.

Yours very truly,

Andrason
