The Official Personnel Folder off

small amount of cursive handwriting, and handwriting

specimens of Herman Edward KIMSEY were also for-

warded with the request that an examination and compari-

son be made to determine if eithe

or KIMSEY

5.

The handwriting in the "Flolms note" exhibits

some evidence as having been written by a person not as

natureas

It is noted that

he is to penaps an adolescent.

has two sons about 22 years of

age and ond about 17 years old.

6. Notwithstanding the negative finding about the

handwriting, we have compared the typing in the 'LIFE

Magazine" letter with the typing in the several letters

from

to the Agency, and it is our conclusion

that the "LIFF. Magazine" letter was typed on the same

machine

has been using to write letters to

Agency personnel. 3

7. Furthermore, there are several similaritics

in the construction and lay-out, phraseology, and

general theme of the "LIFE Magazine" letter and 03

KATONA's letters to lead to the conclusion that

typed the "LIFE Magazine" letter on his own typewmter

8. Some of these similarities, among others: are:

(1) All the paragraphs are indented five spaces in both the

questioned and known letters; (2) the use of hyphenated

phrases and clauses in the middle of sentences, (3) the use

of "'SPY OUT IN THE COLD"' in at least two instances, and

(1) several instances of appellations such as "701 Class of

''62" 0= "Agent 701".

9. SUMMARY: It is our opinion that KIMSEY can

be eliminated as a suspect in this matter. It is our

opinion that the "LIFE Magazine" letter was typed on

typewriter byL

handle the letter (enclosures) in order that it may be pro-

cossed for latent fingerprints. The copy of the "LIFE

Magazine" letter is

a Xerox copy made through a screen,

which indicates that it was probably produced by a Xerox

System mass production printer.

This leads to the specu-

lation that many other copies might have been produced.

11. All of the documents are attached. Any ques-

tions regarding this matter should be directed to Lon

Thomas, x-2009 or x-3636.
