Director, Metropolitan

On July 27, 1962, AARON M. KOHN, Managing

Crime Commission of New Orleans,

Inc., advised that he had developed information that

within the

past several weeks JOSEPH MARCELLO and NICK

MOSCA had taken over the operation of the Elmwood Planta-

tion, 5400 River Road, Jefferson Parish.

It is the personal knowledge of Agents of the

New Orleans Office that the Elmwood Plantation has, for

the past eight years, been a moderately-priced restaurant

of good reputation, catering particularly to ladies' bridge

groups and ladies'

club luncheons.

It has been previously reported that NOLA

Printing Company, 530 Iris Avenue, Jefferson Parish,

Louisiana, ceased operating as a race wire service on

September

13, 1961.

This company still publishes the

Daily Sports Bulletin, which contains scratch information

on horses running at various tracks throughout the United

States.

In 1948, CARLOS MARCELLO was interviewed by

Agents of the FBI.

At that time, he advised he purchased

the New Southport Club in Jefferson Parish in the Summer

of 1948 for $160,000.00 and that this club was a gambling

establishment.

NO T-30, who has had an opportunity to observe

JFK Law 11(a)

This office has under investigation the activities

of a gambling casino in Jefferson Parish in the case captioned,

"ALBERT J. SALZER, ET AL; THE CHESTERFIELD CLUB, ITAR-GAMBLING,"

Investigation has revealed that The Chesterfield Club located

in Jefferson Parish operates casino-type gambling consisting

of roulette, dice and blackjack.
