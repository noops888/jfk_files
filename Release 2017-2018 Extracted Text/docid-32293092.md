On November 4, 1959, Mr. JAMES H. RAND telephonically

contacted the Cleveland Office and advised that he

had some information concerning the subject which he

felt would be of interest to this office.

that he had just returned from Russia and New York

City and wished to give this information to the

Cleveland Office since he felt that it involved

matter within our investigative jurisdiction and

one which should be looked into.

Mr. RAND was thereafter contacted at the Rand

Development Corporation at which time he provided

information concerning the subject's defection.

This information had largely been fumished by

previously and the Bureau has been

furnished this information in previous correspondence

in this matter.

RAND stated that he had learned that the subject

had initially applied for Soviet citizenship upon

his first arrival in the U.S.S.R. on June 10, 1959.

It was his understanding that the suject initiated

the entire procedure and actually had some difficulty

in getting the Soviets to accept him. He originally

contacted a Soviet official at the Moscow Fair.

This official's name was SHISHKIN (Phonetic).

as soon as the Soviets decided to

process the subject, they obtained from him a very

detailed bibliography of his life in the United States

which included previous residences, employments, educa-

tion; military service and all other background infor-

mation generally required by the United States Government

in their PSQ.
