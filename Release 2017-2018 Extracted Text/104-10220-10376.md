MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Cuban Delegation Planning to Come to Washington

At 1730 hours 12 January Mr. Barnes was given a summary

of our present information concerning subject, which consteted of the

sollowing tomes 1. The purpore y the cavacant in

To thank President Elaenhower for the $i, 000, 000

relief fund made available for Cuban relugees:

b, To thank the Peruvian Ambassador for the break

in relations between Peru and Cuba.

c. To try to get an audience with the OAS in ordor

to influence other Latin American countrles to bresk

relatione with Cuba..

2. According to a Bender source (AMCLATTER-I) who talked

with Tony Varona, Varona considers this a completely unilateral

operation, i,e., an Autentico Party operation, It was arranged by

Tony through one Ernesto Rojas who contacted White House officials

Hopkins and White. Also involved are Manolo Braña, Jose Antonio

Maestre and an MRR man named Jose Antonio Mendes. (AMCLATTER-1

also mentioned a (fnu) Manolin Hernandez, a wealthy sugar man

connected with the Reforma Central.) AMCLATTER-1 had no

information concerning the size of the group although estimates seem

to run from a few hundred to about a thousand.

3. From Mr. Jacobs we hear that Rojas is an unofficial delegate

of AMBIDDY and lives at 6711 Glencarlyn Drive, Lake Barcroft, Falle

Church, JEfferson 2-5598. A call to this number was anawered by

Rojas' wife who eaid yes, he is connected with the matter of 1, 000

Bill Kent reported from Miami that Rojas is working with

Manuel Brana and in Now York with Jose Antonio Mestro, allas Jose

Agustine Mendes:

Rojas talked to Ms. White and Mr. Hopkins of the

White House Staff In Pennsylvanis recently,

5. AMCLATTER-! aldo reported that Tony Varona said he was

dealing with Eduardo Gonzales; a Rescate man in New York, who was

bringing down 300 people from New York In addition to the unspecified

number of people coming from Miami.

6. AMCLATTER-1 commented that when Rasco found out about

the proposed trip he called the MDC representative, name unknown,

in New York and told him to see that the movement was stopped

since

It was not FRD-sponsored. Eduardo Gonsales called Varona to try to

get the MDC representative to lay off, which Tony did, assuring Rasco

that thia was his own personal operation.

%. Mr. Stanulia suggested that Mr. Barnes should make it quite

clear in any conversations at the White House that we seriously doubt

that at this atage Varona or anyone else can exort very much control

Lí the delegation comes to Washington.. Thia seems obvious since by

now not only does it avem that several groupa in addition lo Varona'e.

were initially involved in the organization of the cavalcade but others

may well try to gut into the act.

8. We have been promised through the Bender channel more

precise information on when the cavalcade will arrive but given the

somewhat confused picture one cannot count on receiving advance

word.

Note: See memorandum to A/DDP/A, subject "Jose Manuel Braña

Duran. "
