NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER

A Introduction

During his 11 or 12 years' service in the KGB Second Chief

Directorate, NOSENKO said, he rose from case officer to deputy

chief of a department and from lieutenant to lieutenant colonel

lor, as he has

stated more recently, only to the rank of captain).

An English speaker, he had specialized in operations against

American targets in the USSR as he steadily advanced to higher

positions in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department

(from entry on duty with the KGB in 1952 or 1953 until 1955,

and from January

1960 to January 1962) and in the Tourist Depart-

ment (from June 1955 to January 1960, and from January 1962 until

the defection).

His duties took him to England in 195% and 1958,

Cuba in 1960,

and Bulgaria in 1961 as well as to Switzerland in

1962 and 1964; also, NOSENKO made numerous trips

within the USSR

in connection with

operations, inspections, ard conferences.

Commendations, twice accompanied by

bonuses, were awarded to him

by the KGB Chairman in 1956, 1959, and

1961 and by the head of

the Second Chief Directorate in 1957 and 1958: he was one of

70 Second Chiet Diroctorate officers awarded the Order of the

'Red Star in 1962; and in

the same year he received a manal for

completing ten years of "irreproachable service."*

Thur,

according to NOSENKO, his defection ended

a promising career

marked by promotions, responsible positions, extensive travel,

and many honors.

NOSENKO has discussed a large number of KGB operations, in-

cluding some in which he had a personal role, either as a par-

ticipant or as a supervisor, and others conducted by other KGB

personnel in the First and

Second Chief Directorate about which

he learned through his professional and persoral contacts..

Those in which he played a personal role are covered in this

part of the paper.

All are included in Part VI.

The text of

the paper distinguishes the information from collateral sources

and investigations from the details which NOSENKO has provided

on the same topics.

NOSENKO has admitted recently, however, that he never got

any awards at all in the KGB.

Bo. EntEy into the KGB

NOSENKO has provided a wide range of dates for his entry

on duty with the KGB and has offered disparate descriptions of

the circumstances and procedures involved in his becoming a

KGB staff officer.

His statements on these two topics are

presented under separate headings below.

1..

Date of Ertry

A range of dates between early 1952 and 2 April 1953 has

been given by NOSENKO as the time when he entered on duty with

the KGB, but he has been most consistent in placing his entry

in the month of March 1953,*

in

summary, he has said the

beginning of 1952 (statement of j1 January

1964), May 1952 with

no day (statement of February 1964), 5 or

7 September 1952

(statement of 6 April 1964). March 1953 with no day (statements

of 9 Jure 1962,

24 April 1966 and 27 October 1966).

12 or 15 or

17 March 1953 (statement of 8 April 1964),

13 0r 15 March 1953

(statement of 26 July 1965), and 2 April 1953 (statement of

- 17

April 1966).

When

iast questioned about this subject, on

27 October 1966, NOSEUKO acknowledged that he had lied when he

had earlier reported his entry as occurring in 1952.

His state-

ments about the entry date are arranged in chronological order

below.

2 June 1962 (first CIA meeting with NOSENKO) : "In the

beginning of 1953 I came to Moscow Lfrom duty with the GRU in

Primorsk/.

This was 1953, in the beginning.

in January.

Well,

I came on

leave to Moscow.

I was staying at my father's dacha

there...

I was then in the Navy GRU.

So I came to Moscow on

leave

and, while I was home_near Moscow at my father's dacha,

/General Bogdan Zakharovich./ KOBULOV* dropped in on us.

A con-

versation simply began. He said: 'What are you doing?"

I said:

'I'm working in GRU.

I worked ir. the Far East and now I'm work-

ing in the Baltic.

I came here on leave.'

KOBULOV said: 'How

do you like the work?:

I replied: 'Well, speaking horestly, I

don't like the work. ' 'Well," he

with

said, "You better come to work

US.

Where do you want to go?

Into intelligence or counter-

intelligence?'..•

I did not want to go into intelligence. I

Several of NOSENKO's remarks about his date of entry into

the KGB were made during CIA questioning about how and

when he first learned of the KGB agent 'ANDREY". the lead

to "ANDREY" was one of the two pieces of information which

NOSENKO offered to sell when he approached CIA In 1962

(see Part II.B.): the "ANDREY case is discussed at

greater length in Part VI.D.3.b.

** Other sources have reported that KOBULOV was expelled

from the State Security apparatus in 1946 and that he did

not return to a position of authority until a few days

after Lavrentiy BERIYA became MGB-MVD. Minister on 9 or

10 March 1953.

As of 1952, KOBULOV was working in East

Germany for both Wismut A.G.,

a uranium ore-mining con

and for the Soviet contingent to the Allied Control

Commission

KOBULOV was arrested at the same time as

BERIYA,

along with others in the KGB. See Part V.B. 2.

31 January 1964: Yurly Ivanovich CUK was reassigned from

Second Chief Directorate "in something like 1952,"

NOSENKO said, "exactly just about the time when I came

the GRU to the KGB.

He was already gone by that time."*

February 1964: After his defection on 4 February 1964,

NOSENKO prepared an official statement about his biography.

He said that he had entered the KGB in 1952, and he shifted

the dates of most of the events during the 1945-1955 perica one

year backwards

from the version given in 1962.

This was dis-

cussed with NOSENKO, and he repeated the new dates; he then

studied and approved an official statement on his biography

(for the Intelligence Community) which contained the new dates.

including his claim that he entered on duty with the KGB in

about May 1952.

6 April 1964:

Confronted with the above inconsistencies,

NOSENKO said that he returned to Moscow in August 1952 and during

the same month had a conversation with KCB persornel about getting

8 April 1964: The interrogator pointed out to NOSENKO that

he had on different occasions dated his entry

into the KGB as

January 1952, March 1953, and in September 1952. The questioning

continued:

rark of lieutenant of the Administrative

torate of the MGB-KGB. "

24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement): "In

SAVITSKIY called me at home and told me to come to see KOBU-

LOV... I worked in the First Section, First LAmerican/ Depart-

ment from the middle of March 1953 until July 1955."

27 October 1966: NOSENKO reaffirmed that he entered the

KGB in mid-March 1953. He said that he had lied when he earlier

said that he had joined the KGB in 1952, and that he knew he was

lying at the times he made these statements.

Asked why he had

lied, he replied: "There was no

sense.'

NOSENKO then went on

to explain that because he was only an

average student and

because he was a heavy drinker, he had been found unsuitable

Since. April 1966, NOSENKO has said he joined the GRU in

1951, a year later.

by the KGB entry commission when he first applied in 1950.

Therefore, NOSENKO continued, he had been trying to conceal

this fact

from CIA by moving events back a year, for he thought

CIA would not have believed him if he reported that he was

first rejected by the KGB and was later accepted.

2. Circumstances and ProcEdures of Entry

Although NOSENKO has consistently associated his entry into

the KGB with his discussions with General KOBULOV, * he has been

inconsistent concerning the content of their conversation, when

it occurred, its relationship ir. time to other events (see

Part IV. 8.), and where it took place,

at his father's dacha or

at KOBULOV's dacha.

Also, whereas NOSENKO said in 1962 that

there were virtually no administrative formalities prerequisite

to his entry, he recalled in 1964 that he had had conversations

with various KGB

personnel officers and (at home) had completed

a KCB questionnaire and

a biographic form.

NOSENKO was question

ed at length on these points during 1964 and 1965.

As a resilt,

he provided lengthy descriptions of his various interviews at

KGB Headquarters and of the questionnaire and other documents ne

completed.

In April 1966,

however, NOSENKO reverted to his

original statement of 1962: There were no interviews with KGB

personnel officers, and he implied that he had filled out no

official forms.

His various statements are presented in chrono-

logical order below.

9 June 1962:

"KOBULOV was at our dacha.

Well, he is a great

friend of my father.

He was First Deputy to BERIYA, and my

Father was Minister of the Shipbuilding Industry•• A conversa-

tion simply began.

He said: 'What are you doing?'

I said:

'I"m

working in GRU.

I worked in the far East and now I'm working

on the Baltic.

I came here on leave.'

KOBULOV said: 'How do

you like the work?'

I replied:

*Well, speaking honestly, I

don't like the work.'

'Well, ' he said,

"You better come to work

with us.

Where do you want to go? Into intelligence or counter-

intelligence?'..•

I did not want to go into intelligence. I

consider that only people who have seven, even ten years'

ex-

perience in counterintelligence work should be sent to intelli-

gence.

After this,

let them go into positive intelligence.

Then

asked me where I wanted to work, I answered: 'It is better, of

course, to go into counterintelligence.'

'Good.

had a pass for me...

So I went.

Picked up my pass and went.:

[NOSENKO next gives a description of his route to the KGB build-

ing, his receipt of a pass,

and his visit to the Central KGB

Personnel Office.

They talked to me.

This man -I don't know

who or what he was - asked where I worked before and all that.

He said:

"о.к.

We'll request your file from GRU.

We will check

you out and will let you know whether or not we will take you.'

That's all."

NOSENKO was asked wether he completed any forms

or questionnaires.

"NO.

Not there.

They gave

me three copies

of forms

to take home.

There were

so many questions.

About my

parents, my education, my residences, addresses.

I filled all

this out...

Finally I

completed

all

three copies and called

them.

I was told that this time I would not need a pass, that

I should just go to the entrance, and the person (the personnel

officer

would come down-and take the papers from me.

I went,

brought the papers, and he took them from me, and also three

copies of my handwritten autobiography...

Then I was called by

the personnel people once more.

And

at that time another

officer talked to me, and

this

time I knew who was talking to

me, because I was told to go to talk to ROZHENKO [first name

unknown, later identified

as a Section Chief in the Personnel

Department].

This was in March...

Just as soon as STALIN died,

KOBULOV came back from Germany immediately.

He must have been

summoned by BERIYA

or someone.

And so, in just a few days -

evidently he did not forget - I got a call.

It was Bogdan

Zakharovich's assistant.

ile told me to go

to the central

entrance, that I diún't need a pass.

I remember it as if it

just happened.

I went in the uniform of a

lieutenant, but with

sat down (in KOBULOV's office). I thought it would be for five

minutes.

I waited there almost two hours.

The assistant came

out a few times and told me that Bogdan Zakharovich is very,

very busy, but that he would give me an escort.

Some senior

lieutenant came up to me and told me to follow him..:

We went

up to the sixth floor of the old building. I remember: it as

though it just happened.

Then I was told to go in.

I announced myself.

He

said:

with him, I'll take him along bith me and shor him around.'

He took me and talked to me for a while and then told me to

Either the 12th or the 17th. I don't remember."

15 April 1964:

NOSENKO again described the KGB question-

naire and autobiographic forms he had filled out at home and

recalled that he had also signed a secrecy agreement in the

personnel office.

He also remembered that he had made several

additional phone calls to the KGS personnel office and described

his second visit there to talk to ROZHENKO:

"At the end of

February I was told again to stop in the Pass Office and pick up

a pass and

go to the same floor,

but another room.

They told me

I would have to talk to ROZHENKO today.

He was a Chief of

Section, of the Personnel Section.

So we had a talk.

the same thing again:

'Tell me about yourself.'

he just wanted to look me over.

And after that they said: 'All

right, we have not gotten all your documents yet from your

military/ district.

So wait.""

26 April 1965:

NOSENKO recounted his conversation with

KOBULOV, saying that it took piace at KOBULOV's dacha in Usov,

where he and his parents were visiting in January 1953.

After STALIN's funeral NOSENKO was

summoned to KOBULOV's office.

SAVITSKIY, told

NOSENKO to wait.

SAVITSKIY

sent him to SHUBNYAKOV's office.

There he learred that he would

be assigned to the U.S. Embassy Section and was introduced to

the Chief of the American Department,

GORBAT ENKO.

The official

order appointing NOSENKO was issued

the same day, the 13th or

15th of March 1953.

Ministry of Shipbuilding in March 1953. *I had come from the

I was

C. To June 1955 (American Department)

1. Introduction

Depending upon which date he has given fer entering the

NOSENKO's first assignment in the U.S. Embassy Section of the

American Department, working on American correspondents living

in Moscon, lasted for about six to eighteen months.

From that

said, he moved in 1954 to operations against U.S. Mili-

tary Attaches assigned to the Mosco: Embassy, remaining

same section until being transferred in June

1955.

His activi-

ties, as NOSENKO described them, und pertinent collateral infor-

mation on his targets while he was in

the U.S. Embassy Section

are reviewed below.

2. Operations Against Correspondents

On the day of his acceptance into the KGß, NOSENKO was

taken directly to the offices of the U.s.

Embassy Section.

There he met the section chief, V.A. KOZLOV, who told NOSENKO

that he would take over the

a. KGB Files On SHAPIRO, GILMORE, SALISBURY and WHITNEY

When

NOSENKO reported for work the following day, accord-

ing to statements made on 8 April 1961, he found d desk in Room

615.

"There were three other guys sitting there.

was

running traces, and at the same time I was reading the files

on journalists...

I think there were seven files in all, and I

didn't see any

NOSENKO listed these files as those on

Henry SHAPIRO, Eddy GILMORE (as well as one cn GILMORE'S wife

SEREBRYAKOVA and her sister CHERNYSHEVA) , Harrison SALISBURY

and Thomas WHITNEY.*

During the 1962 meetings with 'CIA, NOSENKO identified

SHAPIRO as an "old agent of ours." He

said that WEITNEY "worked

for us while he was in Moscow and gave us some material, but he

refused to work for us when he left the country and would not

contact us in the United States."

GILMORE, NOSENKO said, was an

active recruitment target in 1953 and 1954, but NOSENKO did not

Likewise, he did not know the

status of SALISBURY as of 1953.

NOSENKO stressed that the files he was given to read during

the early period of his KGB service were developmental files

(delo formulyar) rather than the operational files of the agents.

The developmental files were less sensitive, and from them

would never be able to figure out whether he lthe subject of

the filel is an agent or not."

NOSENKO explained that, once a

person becomes an agent, another file is set up, and these agent

"NOSENRO made clear that he was not the case officer responsi-

ble for the more important correspondents:

"KOZLOV himself

was working with them, the chief of the section himself-with

SHAPIRO, with SHAPIRO's wife.

I also know that KOZLOV was

working

with WHITNEY and with (Andrew J.l STEIGER.••

FOr

each of these persons there was an operational file which I

did not see.".

According to. NOSENKO, he was in no way involved

with STEIGER and Edmund STEVENS,

both of whom were American

correspondents recruited as agents by the KGB.

## Page 12

files were held by the chief of the section, KOZLOV. NOSENKO

stated that he read the files on these seven persens slowly

and made some extracts for myself in my personal log--such things

as notations of their dates of arrival, things I could not reme

ber. *

He was also given the files on the agents surrounding

these correspondents, their drivers, maids, and cooks.

b. Agonts Reporting on Correspondents

NOSENKO said he was responsible for handling the agents who

were roporting on SHAPIRO, WHITNEY, SALISBURY

and the GILMORES

and met with them regularly to learn whether

"anything was new,

who did SHAPIRO meet, what might be interesting in his behavior,

and might be suspicious in his behavior, who he is contacting,

He then reported to KOZLOV and would sometimes prepare a

writton report of his conversationg with

Asked to

describe these meetings, NOSENKO replied:

"Let us take the same

case of SHAPIRO. I would meet drivers about three times a monti

or evan two times.

At the meeting I would ask the driver what

was new in SliAPIRC's behavior since our last meeting, whether

SHAPIRO had suspicious contacts with foreigners, about his meet-

ings with Russians,

were they conducted openly or, perhaps, was

SHAPIRO walking behind the person he met. And then the man

(agent) would begin his report.

Of course, if he spots anything

suspicious he calls immediately,

and I would see him the next

mornina.

Otherwise, I would tell him at the meeting that I

would see him again

in about ten days or in two weers, but if

there was something interesting he

should call irmediately.

It was the same with the maid and the cook.

Upon returning to

the office I would have to report to KUZLOV about my meetings,

either orally or in writing.

If,

for example, [V.M.) KOVSHU:

lalso of the U.S. Embassy Section) had a meeting with his agents,

he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV or as soon as conveni-

ent to both.

If the meetings were taking place late in the day

and lasted until midnight or later and there were no written

materials submitted at

the meeting, I could go home and then re-

port the next morning."

KOZLOV accompanied NOSENKO to meetings with the various

agerts surrounding the

"At first he was teach-

ing me.

Then he would go in cases when something interesting

would begin to develop, even when it hadn't yet begun to develop

but when

there may have been a hint in a case of some other case

officer.*

NOSENKO's agent network consisted mainly of domestic and

clerical personnel in contact with the correspondents and their

families.

Asked to describe them, he said on 15 April 1964:

"My first agent was a woman agent, a cook, who was working at

GILMORE's place.

Her codename was "AGLODINA', a funny one", carGEy".

She also worked at the Associated Press later.

My second agent was

a chauffeur whose codename, I think, was

I think he

was driving WHITNEY.

I also had SHAPIRO's chauffeur, a

funny little fellow.

charwomen, chauffeurs,

this was my agentura lagent network]."

Although NOSENKO was

able to give a breakdown of this network in terms of the number

and type of agents targetted against particular individuals, he

had forgotten their true names and could not provide detailed

personality information on any of them.. He explained:

"I don't

remember now.

They all passed by like a river because they were

selected and handled the agent who was placed in SHAPIRO'& office

as a secretary; this agent had earlier worked in the offices of

Moscow News, an English-language newspaper published in Moscow.

## Page 13

He first identified GILMORE'S COOk, "AGLODINA," as Yelena

S. RUSIENKO in the fall of 1965, while reviewing a list of sov-

jets employed by Americans in Moscow. He. told CIA at that tine

•that he had taxen over KOSIENKO from

TOrMOZOV upon entering the

U.S. Embassy Section in 1953, and that she subsequently worked

for and reported on GILMORE's successor, Richard KASISCHKE.

NOSENKO

said that KOSIENKO "never

provided any interesting

formation."

NOSENKO estimated that he was responsible for handling 10

to 12 agents in operations against the correspondents.

cers might have as many as

agentura down as follows:

Target

Agents

Eddie GILMORE

Two agents.

the cook and the driver:

one operational contact; a part-time

cleaning

girl; and a girlfriend of

GILMORE's sister-in-law, who

reported

on the sister-in-law and GILMORE'S

wife.

Thomas WHITNEY

One agent, his driver.

Henry SHAPIRO

Three agents, SHAPIRO's secretary

and his cahuffeur, plus an old woman

who was a relative of SHAPIRO's wife

and lived with the SHAPIROS in Mos-

(The secretary and chauffeur

later worked for Kenneth BRODNEY and

reported on him to NOSENKO; BRODNEY

temporarily took SHAPIRO's place in

Moscow. )

Harrison SALISBURY

Two agents, SALISBURY's driver, "SER-

GEY"

and a part-time cleaning girl.

NOSENRO classified two other of his agents as "neutral," in

that they did not have specific targets on whom to report. The

first of these was the director of MOSGRAN, a Russian language

training

program for toreigners

in Moscow.

His cryptonym was

"RAKETA " but NOSENKO could not recall his true name.

The sec

ond,

"VOLODINK, " was a female teacher in this same program who

instructed some of the correspondents, including BRODNEY, and

Embassy employees in their homes; he could not recall the true

name of "VOLODINK. "

When NOSENKO was relieved of his responsi-

bility for the correspondents in 1954, he turned over all of his

agents to other case officers in the U.S. Embassy Section with

the exception of "RAKETA" and

"VOLODINK," whom he continued to

handle in his work with military attaches.

c Information from Other Sources

SHAPIRO was identified as a KGB agent by GOLITSYN in 1961,

before the lead was received from NOSENKO, and he had previously

been suspected as such on the basis of his long stay in Moscow.

marriage to a Soviet national.

SHAPIRO was mentioned as a KGB

agent by a cryptonym (known to NOSENKO and confirmed by COLIT

appearing in the CHEREPANOV papers.*

The KGB defector Nikolay KHOKLOV had earlier identified the

Polish-born wife of WHITNEY as a KGB agent, an allegation which

she denied, and it had been long assumed that WHITEY too had

reached some sort of accormodation with the KGB because of this

fact and because of the long duration of his tour as a correspond-

ent in MoscoN.

GILMORE also had

been suspected by CIA before NOSENKO's in-

formation was received.

He servea in Moscow for: 12 years, from

1941 to 1953, and 15 married to a Soviet national.

SALISBURY served two short tours, of about one year each,

(see above)

and was during this period a subject of criticism by

7311

other American correspondents in Moscow for his pro-Soviet arti-

cles.

When WHITNEY married the Pole shortly after STAIN's

death, SALISBURY returned to the United States and his articles

took on an anti-Soviet tone.

NOSENKO claimed no involvement with the other two inerican

correspondents whom he identified

as KGB agents,

STEVENS and

STEIGER, both the subjects of a considerable amount of derogatory

information in CIA files.

under the heading of NOSENKO'S American leads.

Operations Against Military Attache Personnel

Some time in the first half of 1954 NOSENKO was. relieved of

his responsibilities for the correspondent cases, and from then

until his transfer from the American Department he hanäled KGB

Second Chief Directorate operations against the officer person-

nel of the U.S. Military Attache's office.

NOSENKO's account of

the turnover of the correspondent files to his successor and of

the acceptance of the attache files is presented below.

- 8 April 1964: "I took over the Military Attache cases

from Nikolay KHRE:OV...

When I was leaving

in 1955, I turned

attache files over to Valeriy BUDYLDIN."

- 10 April 1964:

"I made a mistake...

I said I accepted

the cases from KHRENOV when I was taking

on the Militery Attache

This is not right. KHRENOV was not working in the First

(U.S. Embassy) Section; he was working in the Fist (American)

Department.

I took over the cases from--let's see, there was

a. Agents Reporting on Military. Attaches

Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network

(agentura) at his disposal in operations against U.S. Mili-

tary Attaches during this period which began in 1954, NO-

SENKO replied:

"There were two maids,

a cook, drivers*...

about ten persons, plus the agent 'SERVIZNIY'

and the one

with the code name

' DMITRIYEV'

... These additional two

agents, about 12 or 13 agents altogether."

With one ex-

ception, this network remained constant until NOSENKO trans-

ferred from the U.S. Embassy Section in mid-1955.

He met

each agent about once a week, except for the chauffeurs who

were met three times a month in a safehouse or on the

street.

According to NOSENKO, this network was

"just a

supporting agentura, which very seldom was worthwhile,

the

main source of information on

the Military Attaches being the

microphones in their offices.**

Newly added to the network while NOSINKO held this

position was a maid inserted to report on Army

speaking university graduate but "hid her knowleage of

English in order to overhear

conversations or read letters

without taking them outside."

Besides NOVIKOVA, NOSENKO named one other maid who was

his agent, Mariya NEVEROVA, code name "SHIVEDOVA,"

and she

RICHARDS.

He described NEVEROVA as a

oman," from whom he never obtained anything of interest.

They met in a safehouse on Kuznetskly Most.

Of the KGB agents among

the chauffeurs, NOSENKO identi-

fied Nikolay SANYRYEV, who was used by various of the at-

"He reported where they went, what they

whether they took notes of photographs, whether they had

unusual packages with them, and so on."

When viewing photographs in September 1964, HOSELKO

icentified Vladislav VOROBYEV as the agent

"SERVIZNIY. " He

had been working in the Embassy since its

establishment,

starting first as a messenger boy and, in NOSENKO's time,

performing clerical tasks.

VOROBYEV had no direct connec

tion with the Military Attaches, and NOSENKO said he himself

did not know why he had been given VOROBYEV to handle in

1954.

NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephore listings of the

Embassy, issued monthly.

"DMITRIYEV'g" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV:

NOSENKO saw this name

on a 1962 phone list and thought, but

was not sure, that this was his agent.

An electrician who

worked on the Embassy's electrical wiring systems and eleva-

tor, "DMITRIYEV" reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires and

The Military Attaches used a pool of five drivers at random,

NOSENKO said. Apart from the permanent driver for the senior

attache, none were targetted against individual members of the

attache

office.

other wires he had observed in the Embassy as well as

on the

security measures on the top floors.

Like VOROBYEV,

"'DMITRI-

YEy" had no direct connection with the Military. Attaches.

In September 1964 NOSENKO was shown a serles of 260 bio-

graphic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American Em

bassy in Moscow.

Each card contained a photograph of the per-

son involved and short biographic notes, including his name

and job in the Embassy.

The first time. he went through these

cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see only.

the photographs; NO-

SENKO

did not identify the photographs of SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV

but said that the face of VOROBYEV was familiar, adding that

he thought his name was VOROBYEV.

When shown the biographic

information on SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV, he identified each of them

as his agents during the 1954-1955 period in the American De-

partment and equated them to the cryptonyms given previously.

In the case of SHNYRYEV, when shown the bicgraphic information,

which listed SHNYRYEV as "chauffeur for the Military Attache,"

NOSENKO exclaimed:

"Oh my God,

this is my own agent."

He

later said it was a good photograph of SiNYRY.

b. NOSENKO's Targets

As the Second Chief Directorate case officer responsible

for operations against American Military (Arnj) Attaches

sta

tioned in Moscow, his main task was not to recruit them but

rather was to prevent the attaches from collecting intelligence.

He has used this statement about his main task (identical with

that of other U.S. Embassy Section officors working against

the Army and Navy Attaches) to support his claim that no U.S.

Armed Forces Attaches were recruited by the KGB from 1953 un-

t11 his defection in 1961.

He has also said that this is one

reason he knows relatively little about the personal back-

grounds of his various targets during this period--the empha-

sis was on surveillance instead of development for recruitment-

purposes.

Asked in February 1965 to list the Army Attache per-

sonnel for whom he was directly responsible during 1954 and

1955, NOSENKO gave the following names:

"MICKELSON, MEARNS,

RICHARDS, FELCHLIN, BENSON, MULE, STROUD, and CARDELLA. "***

His

knowledge. of the activities of these targets and of KGB action

against them, coupled with information from other sources, is

discussed in the following paragraphs.

Naval Attaches were handled by ZHUKOV during this period, NO-

said, while Air Attaches were initially handled by CHURA-

When CHURANOV left the section in early 1954, he turned

over the Air Attache files to PANKRATOV, who turned them over

**This is the order given by NOSENKO.

The list comprises two

generations of Army Attaches in Moscow and is neither in al-

phabetical order nor in terms of date of service in Moscow.

It is, however, in descending order of rank from Colonel NICKEL

SON through Captain MULE to Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA.

Questioned about these officers in a different context, NOSENKO

indicated knowledge of their ranks.

Not mentioned by NOSENKO

was George VAN LAETHEM, Assistant

Army Attache in Moscow from

August 1951 to August 1953 (prior to the time when NOSENKO said

he was responsible for work against the military attache office).

VAN LAETHEM returned to Moscow in 1955, however, and was at-

tached to the Army

Attache staff again fron 19 March to 19 May

1955, during which tine NOSENKO claimed he was still responsible

for this group.

(1) MICKELSON

NOSENKO has identified Earl L. MICKALSON as a colonel

and the Military Attache in Moscow during 1954 and 1955.

PANKRATOV was the case officer originally handling MICKEL

SON, and the case was turned over to NOSENKO in 1954.

When asked about agents who might have been working against.

KICKELSON, NOSENKO

said that there was one cook, a KGB

operational contact whose name he did not recall, and

MICKELSON's maid,

whose name NOSENKO beliered was NOVIKOVA;

the cook and NOVIKOVA went to work for MICKELSON after NO

SENKO had left the U.S. Embassy Section:

In addition to

these two, the only other

source reporting

on WICKELSON was

his chauffeur, whose name. NOSENKO also did not renember.

NOSENKO suid that the KGB learned nothing interesting about

MICKELSON from concealed microphones, telephone taps, or

surveillance, and that no operational approach or recruit-

ment was

in tact, no interesting or

derogatory information on MICKELSON from any source.

According to information in CIA files, MICKELSON was

involved in at least two incidents inside the Soviet Union

vitoich NOSENKO has not reported.

In May 1954 he was arrested

in Tbilisi on the

chares of having photographed a

bridge, but he persuaded the Militia not to press charges.

In August 1951 MICKLI SON was arrested again

for illegal

photographs souti of KHARKOV: on this occasion he was held

for two hours before being released.

(i1)

MEARNS

NOSENKO identified Fillmore K.. MEARNS as MICKELSON's

replacement and said that he was the responsible case

There were two agents and one operational contact

working against ''EARNS.

NOSENKO could recall the

name only of NOVIKOVA,

Besides being told to attempt to overhear NICKEL

SON's conversations NOVIKOVA was instructed to search his

clothing and tu copy any notes she might find, but she

never overheard or found anything of interest to the KGB.

by the KGB while they were being shipped to Moscow from the

United States,

and that

from tele-

phone taps.

CIA has no derogatory or otherwise significant informa-

on MEARNS, who replaced MICKELSON.

(iv) FELCHLIN

NOSENKO identified lloward L. FELCHLIN as a lieutenant

colonel who served

as Assistant Army Attache in Moscow and

tatad that he was FELCHLIN's case ofticer.

FELCHLIN was in

-he Soviet Union during 1954 and part of 1955, until being

declared persona non grata.

NOSENKO did not recall the

nams:: of

any agents specifically targetted against FELCHLIN,

although he thought FEICHLIN must have had a maid and she

would

have been

a KGB agent.

Additionally, NOSENKO said,

the Assistant Military Attaches shared a pool of cars and

drivers, and these were his agents.

Unable to recall the

precise date of FELCHLIN's expulsion, NOSENKO related it to

some event regarding Soviets stationed in the United States

for which the Soviet Government decided to reply in kinü.

NOSENKO was imprecise as to the pretext used to expel FELCH-

LIN, but said the action was based on information which had

been accumulated from

a number of sources and incidents.

For example,

FELCHIIN had been caught

taking

some photographs

and a report had been written; along with other similar

indications of FELCHLIN's activities and reports of agents

in contact with FELCHLIN, the report

was filed away for pos-

sible

future use.

NOSENKO was questioned further on FELCH-

LIN during the February 1965 interrogations.

He said then

that FELCHLIN alone had been declared persona non

grata,

and that no other attaches had been involved.

explained his having but few details concerning this action

by the fact that it took place after NOSENZO had trans-

ferred from the American Department to the Tourist Depart

asked to leave the country.

During his entire tour in Moscow he was

the subiect of intensive KGB interest.

arrival, in September

1953, FELCHLIN,

Army Attache Martin J. MANHOFF, and

two Air Force attaches

incidents.)

YEAGER, an Assistant Army Attache, FELCILIN was arrested in

Kiev by a Soviet Army officer for photographing a miditary

Told that the expulsion took place in 1954,

NOSENKO identified his target John S. BENSON as a

recall the names of any agents working against BENSON but

said that BENSON

knew nothing unusual or interesting about STROUD from any

source.

the victim of the soviets'

seizure of technical eguipment

declarco persona. non grata.

NOSENKO gave the following

account of this incident:

For some time the

Second Chief

Directorate had boon trying to acquire a small, convenient

piece of electronie equipment which American Intelligence

officers were

known to be using during their travels inside

the Soviet Unton.

As early as the beginning of 1954, the

Americnn Nepartment hnd been given authorization from the

Central Coarittco of the Coumunist Party to sterl this

equipment fros tho Americans, provided that the success of

such an operation was assured.

Before his transfer to the

Tourist Department In 1955, NUSENKO himself had helped to

develop plans for tie operation and had even arranged an

abortive attcapt lo stcal the equipment from

ail

attache at

a railroad station outside Moscow.

lihile BENSON, MULE,

and STROUD were on one of their trips (after NOSENXO's trar3-

fer) it was learnud that they had the equipment with them,

and the KCB decided to take it from them in Stalingrad.

To carry out the operation, Licutenant General P.V. FEDOTOV,

then Chief of the KGB Sccond Chief Directorate,

and A.M.

GORBATENKO, Chier of the American Departnent,

flew with

other personnel from the American Department to Stalingrad.

The hotel rooms of BENSOY, STROUD and MULE were watched

constantly from a visual observation post, and it. was noted

that they never ato in the hotel restaurant but always in

their rooms.

It was also noted that the apparatus was

placed under a pillow before they began to cat.

khile

they

were scated at the table having

dinner, therefore, the KGB

officers suddenly entered the roon and

seized the

equipment.

In order to partially cover the illegality of this act,

1t

was decired to make a show of expelling BENSON, MULE and

STROUD from the Soviet Union, and this was done via the

persona non grata action.

According to information from other sources,

the equip-

ment was

seized from BENSON, MULE, and STROUD on

5 May 1955,

and the three were declared persong non grata on 7 May (a

month before

HOSENKO ciained to have transferred to the

Tourist Department).*

When the 7 May date

was given to

NOSENKO during the February 1965 interrogations, he replied

that the operation was handled at a higher level, that he

did not directly participate in it, but that he had been

involved in the earlier planning to seize the equipment.

It was pointed out to him that he had always sald he was in

the Tourist Department at the time of this operation, and

that be had consistently said that he transferred from the

Americhn to the Tourist Department in June 1955.

NOSENKO

shrugged, but offered no comment.

*The

source Kaarlo R. TUOMI, who served in the United

States as a GRU Illegal

Prom 1958 to 19G3, reported to CIA

In 1964 that while working as a KGB informant in Kirov 1n

the early 1950's, he was

targetted against three U.S. yil1-

tary. Attaches travelling on a train

TUOMI believed that

he might have contributed information leading to the three

Americans (as he later read in the Soviet press) being de

clared persona non grata.

It would appear that TONIg

targets were BENSON, MUDs, and STROUD.

(1K) CARDELLA

NOSENKO said that in 1954 and 1955 there was an admini-

strative officer in the Embassy by the name of James CARDELLA.

The KGB had no interesting or unusual information concerning

CARDELLA from any source, and NOSENKO could say nothing more

about his.

CIA files show

that Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA served

in Moscod from September 1953 until June 1955. Other than the

fact that a microphone was discovered in CARDELLA'S MoscOw Em-

bassy office in

1964,

significant collateral information

concerning him is available.

(x) VAN LAFTHEM

NOSENKO identified George VAN LASTHEM as an Assistant Air

Attache at the U.S. Embassy against

an operatior was at-

tempted in 1953 or 1954.

He sald that during this

period a

Russian actress, Alla LARIONOVA, was placed on a train going

from Berlin to Moscow with the mission of striking up an acquain-

tance with VAN LETHEM which could be followed up in Moscow.

She succeeded in meeting him and gave him her aidress and tele

phone: number.

Although she was certain that

she would hear frcr

him, he rever did call her in Moscow.

NOSENKO said that he had

heard about this frou P.F. PANKRATOY, the case officer handling

He added that

CHURANOV was the case officer respon-

as he was for all members of the Air

tache's office at that tine.

NOSENKO knew of no other interest

or activity concerning

CIA records show that VAN LACTIEY was not an Assistant Air

Attache but an Assistant Army Attache, serving in Moscow from

March 1951 to March 1953.*

As cryptographic security officer

and officer in charge of

the Embassy code room, he had super-

visory

responsibility for the military code clerks and mechanics,

Including Dayle SMITIl, and he was on fairly close personal terms

with Sergeant Roy RHODES until the latter's departure from Mos-

cow in January 1953; VAN LAETHEM's duties also carried respon-

sibility for sensitive electronic activities in the Embassy.**

He was again in Moscow from

19 March to 19 May 1955 (at a time

when NOSENKO claims to have been the KGB case officer for U.S.

Army Attaches). Although this trip was always intended to be

only a TDY, it

was represented to the Soviets as a PCS Assistant

Army Attache assignment because of the extremely sensitive na-

ture of his business there.

He was project officer for the en-

tire electronics program at the Embassy, and went to Moscow to

review the operations including the planned use of the new

electronic equipment which was seized from BENSON, MULE, and

2235

STROUD in Stalingrad in May 1955 (see above) •

Although VAN LAETHEM completed his two-year tour in Moscow in

March 1953, just at the time NOSENKO said he entered the KGB;

he was succeeded in his post by Walter MULE, for whom NOSENKO

has claimed full responsibility. Thus,

the fact of his posi-

tion as Assistant: Army Attache and MULE's. predecessor would

presumably be available to NOSENkO..

Each time NOSENKO gave CIA the story of the recruitment of

"ANDREY" in the June 1962 meetings,

he related it to Roy RHODES.

Each reference to Roy RHODES was followed by a statement that

It was through RHODES that the KGB learned of the existence of

special electronic equipment in the U.S. Embassy.

RHODES had no

access to such information.

Do June 1955 to January 1960 (Tourist Department)

1. Introduction

By his account NOSENKO served in the American-Canadian-

British

Section of the Tourist Department, * KGB Second Chief

Directorate, fron June 1955 (shortly after the department

was created to operate with and against foreign

travellers

in the USSR) until his transfer to another department in

that directorate in January 1960.

He was a case officer

until appointed Deputy Chief of the Section about June

1958.

In staterents made prior to April 1966, NOSENKO claimes to

have been twice promoted during this four and one-half year

period-to captain in July 1956 and to major in August or

September 1959--but in a signed statement of April 19€6 be

said he remained a captain from 1956 until his defection.

NOSENKO has described his personal and direct partici-

pation in the section's activities as consisting of:.

-Recruitment of two Soviet nationals as homosexual

agents, **

with NOSENKO

their handler from the outset until

they were dropped in 1962 or 1963.

-Recruitment and handling of Soviets as agents tar-

getted against American tourists; their number varied from

eight to 14 and many were employed by Inturist.

-Operations involving i4 foreigners who visited the

USSR for various lengths of time.

-Recruitment and handling of the American Express Co

pany representative in Moscow,

whom NOSENKO continued to

meet following his reassignment in January 1960.

-Decision in October 1959 that Lee Harvey OSWALD was

of no operational interest to the KGB,

and subsequent par-

ticipation in the KGB investigation of OSWALD's

activities

in the USSR.

Each of these categories is discussed separately below.

2. Soviet Homosexual Agents

Because he had been

seen meeting a foreigner in a

public lavatory in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded

that A.I. VOLKOV might be

a homosexual and hence of some

operational value.

The KGB therefore mounted an operation

which verified this possibility in 1987: A homosexual agent

of the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department provoked

VOLKOV into a compromising situation. Then VOLKOV, who had

previously been a KGB agent but was at this time deactivated,

was called to KGB Headquarters where, after NOSENKO interro-

rated him, he admitted his homosexuality and agreed to

"These components are also known as the First Section and

Seventh Department, respectively.

#This tera refers to agents whose homosexuality is er

ploited py the KGB against certain male targets.

## Page 26

NOSENKO's proposal

to work for the KGB among homosexuals.

VOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year to recruit a hono

sexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronynic not recalled)

YEFRENOV.

The two agents subsequently worked

as a tean

against foreigners under NOSENKO's dirertion; in addition

to specific targets, they had the general assignment of

associating with

foreign visitors in Ho:cow for the pur-

pose of spotting possible honosexuals.

NOSENKO described

on 12 June 1962 his use of these agent a:

Then we think about what he represents. Is he worth it?

Then, as Chief, I recommend that he be recruited or not-

If he can give something, I say:

'Well, let's have

this, I speak to these boys:

When NOSENKO moved from the Tourist Department to the

Second Chief Directorate's inerican Department in January

1960,

he took VOLKOV and YEFREMOV with him.

They were

never used against targets in the U.S. Embassy, but, NOSENKO:

said, the Tourist Department "used to call me on homosexual

prospects."

VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued as active KGB

agents until some time in 1960 or 1961, after which they

could not be used further since they had become too well

known, and NOSENKO finally retired their files to KGB

archives in 1962 or 1963..

The last operation in which these

two agents participated was during January 1962.

During interrogation on these agents, NOSENKO has been

unable to tell where they lived in Moscow,

their family

situation, or other such details.

He said that he never

met either in a safehouse (always

on the street) and never

net either of them alone, without the other being present..

## Page 27

109.

NOSENKO has described eleven KGB approaches to Americans

based on

compromising evidence obtained with the assistance

of VOLKOV and/or YEFRENOV and several other cases in which

Americans were suspected of being homosexuals on the basis

of the evaluation of these two.

Additionally,

at least six Americans, not reported on by

NOSENKO, have had contacts with one or both of these arents

in Moscow.

With one or possibly two exceptions, all

the contacts of VOLKOV and YEFREYOV reported by NOSENKO. Or

other sources took place during the period from April to

November 1959.

The known exception was the KGB approach to

W.E. JOHNSON in January 1962;* the possible exception was

the contact with the American psychiatrist, which took place

in 1959 or early 1960 but cannot be dated precisely.

Finally,

NOSENKO has described the contacts between VOLKOV; YEFREMOV,

and the American Robert BARRETT in the summer of 1959 but

does not know of their contacts in the summer of 1961,

shortly before BARRETT was approached on the basis of con

promising information obtained in 1959.***

3.

Other Soviet Agents

The Tourist Department, Just established when NOSENKO

was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent network for

operations against American and British tourists.

Conse-

quently, NOSENKO

he and the other case officers had

"start from the beginning."

As a first step, NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow

officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist; these

were not agents, he explained, but "just persons known to

the KGB so that a KGB man could approach one of them with

somebody or something."

NOSENKO began

to

collect information on these individuals and others

with the

aim of formalizing their recruitment; by the end of 1955,

he estimated, he had a network of about eight agents, all

of then Inturist interpreters.

During the following

four

the number of agents

whom NOSENKO handled varied:

Agents would be transferred from

one case officer to another,

some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of changing

all the time, back and forth."

In 1956, NOSENKO said, he had

about ten agents, in 1957 there were about 12, in 1958 about

•eight, and at the end of 1959 (when he was preparing to return

to the American Department) he had approximately 12 to 14.

NOSENKO has provided information on five of these agents,

all of whom he says he recruited from within Inturist during

1955. These were:

-Larissa SOBOROVA: An Inturist interpreter and one of

the first Inturist agents recruited by. NOSENKO.

" SOBOROVA

was NOSENKO's agent until 1959 (when she married and retired)

and reported to him on all foreigners with whom she worked as

an interpreter.

She worked with NOSENKO in the operation

against

Ain the summer of 1957.*

NOSENKO reported specifically on her possible serual involve

ment with two other tourists, one American and the other British.

during 1957-1959.

NOSENKO mentioned at one point that he "even

told Larissa about his last name."

Vladinir KUPOMTSEV: K33 cryptonym "LEGEDEV, " recruited

in 1955.

(NOSENKO has also said that KUROMTSEY had been a

Second Chief Directorate agent "since 1958.")

MUROMTSEY was

called into the army in about 1959 and was gent to some Soviet

Air Force academy in Central Asia, here he dorked as an inter

preter for Syrian students studyira there.

Diring this period,

his file was held by the local KG in Central Asia.

Later he

returned to Moscor and was reactivated by the Second chief

Directorate.

- Nikolay ROGOV:

kGb cryptonym "Ozero," recruited in 1955.

ROGOV haù formerly been a "confidential contact" of the KGB.

He worked in the central office of Inturist which

assigned

interpreters

to British and Arerican citizens visiting the

Soviet l'nion.

AS NOSENKO

indicated, BELITSKIY reported on SHULGIA, who he said was a

close friend.

BELITSKIY said that she was directly involved,

probably as the principal, in a sexual entrapment operation,

in the recruitment of a member of the British Parlament.

BELITSKIY reported to CIA on SHULGINA in October 1962; NOSENKO

said his last connection with the BELITSKIY case was in Geneva

in the spring of 1962.)

- Tamara KUNGAROVA: Inturist interpreter recruited in

1955 (according to NOSENKO's statemert in April 1964 - see

above on SHULGINA).

ferred as an agent to the Tourist Department by the British

Commonwealth Department in 1957 or the beginning of 1958..

In 1957 or 1959

she was involved in a sexual compromise

operation against an American professor, which did not

reach the point of a recruitment approach, Between 1957

or 1958 and 1900 she was working against an American tourist

named Philip NIFLSEN who was suspected of connection with

CIA and who was under study for recruitment by the

KGB. *

KUNGAROVA later married NIELSEN and the two lived in :,

England.

The KGB was still interested in NIELSES at the

time NOSENKO left the Tourist Department,

but NOSENKO be

leved there was no recruitment. Urs. NIELSEN died in 1965.

Besides those in Inturist, NOSENKO has named several

other agents whom he recrufted

or was given while in the

Tourist Departnent.

These included tha following:

-Aleksey A. DMITRIYEV: KGB cryptonym "TOMO," a can-

didate member of the Academy of Sciences

USSR and a special-

ist on Japan and Thailand.

DMITRIYEV speaks Japanese and

English and worked at the Japanese exhibition in Moscow.

NOSENKO did not indicate how. DMITRIYEV was used operationally

or how he was connected with the American-Canadian-British

target..

-(Inu) IVANOV: A lawyer employed by the Institute of

Foreign Trade in Moscow.

NOSENKO did not personally re-

cruit this agent.

IVANOV moved to Moscow from the Baltic

area and his previous handlers there notified the Center,

suggesting that the agent might be of use in the capital.

NOSENKO contacted IVANOV and later turned him over to the

British Commonwealth Department of the Second Chief Direc-

torate which,

NOSENKO believed,

"planted him in the British

Trade Mission or sorething like that."

-Marina RYTOVA:

KGB cryptonym "KRYMOVA, " born about

1923 or 1924 and educated at the Military Institute of

Foreign Languages, a special school which also had Communist

students from foreign countries.

There she studied military

subjects as well as

foreign languages.

She speaks English

and Greek well.

NOSENKO could not recall who recruited her,

but she

was turned over to him by i.A.

KONSTANTINOV, a

Tourist Department case officer, in 1956 or 1957.

At that

time she was working as an interpreter at the Russian

Permanent Exhibit in Moscow and continued in this job until

about 1960, when she became

an instructor ip the Greek

language school of the Institute of International Relations.:

She reported to NOSENKO any information which she obtained

on foreign delegates or foreign tourists who visited the

Exhibit in Moscow.

As she was often invited by the Ministry

of Agriculture to

interpret during meetings between Soviet

officials and

delegates from America, England,, and Greece,

she also reported this information to NOSENKO.

RYTOVA

served several times as an interpreter for KHRUSHCHEV and::

once participated in a conversation he had with' Iowa farmer

GARST.

In 1959 or 1960 she was sent as interpreter with a

snal1

delegation which visited GARST's farm in the United

States and was used by the KGB Legal Residency in Washington,

RYTOVA is married to a man who worke in one of the military

offices in Moscow and is a captain or a major.

They have

one daughter, approximately 14 years old.

-Yevgeniya ("Jane"). DANKO: KGB cryptonym "OKSANA."

She worked in the American Express Company office in Moscow

for Arsens FRIPPEL and later for FRIPPEL'S sUccessor,

Michael JELISAVCIC.* DANKO was handled by I.A. KONSTANTINOV

from about 1955 to 1957 and was then turned over to NOSENKO.

She reported on JELISAVCIC, who was not approached, according

to NOSENKO.

4. Operations with Foreign Visitors

NOSENKO said he participated in 14 operations with

foreign visitors to the USSR while a member of the American

Canadian Section of the Tourist Department.

Nine of these

operations resulted in recruitments (excluding one who later

was recruited by

another element of the XGB, but including

another whom NOSENKO classified as a borderline case). Of

the remaining five operations which did not end with a re-

cruitment, no approach was contemplated by the KGB in one

case; one

target rejected NOSENKO's proposal, the KGB was

unable to obtain compromising material

for an approach to a

third,

and for political reasons the KGB decided against

approaching the final two.

Although the information from NOSENKO on the timing of

these operations does not always agree with that from other

sources, these cases can be grouped chronologically as

follows:

1955 - one; 1956 - one; 1957

- three; 1958 - two;

and 1959 - seven.

The operations in 1955, 1956 and,

with

one exception, 1959 were homosexual provocations.

The

те.

cruitment of Arsene FRIPPEL in 1959 was based on heterosexual

compromise.

These fourteen operations are summarized briefly belo

in the approximate order in which

the cases began.

each case, NOSENKO's information is followed by

a summary of

the results of CIA investigations.

The description of the

case is more detailed than the others, for reasons in-

dicated in the text.

a. Attempted Entrapment of MALIA (1955)

NOSENKO's Information: Martin MALIA, a graduate student,

spent about four months in the USSR in 1955 and was sus-

pected of having connections with American Intelligence.

Toward the end of his stay, while under surveillance, MALIA

was observed in contact with a Soviet citizen believed to

be a homosexual.

The Soviet was detained by the KGB, and

NOSENKO eventually obtained a confession that he bad had

homosexual relations, with MALIA.

After. NOSENKO. had arranged

for the Soviet to introduce MALIA to a KGB homosexual agent,

the latter enticed MALIA to a specially equipped hotel room

In Moscow; NOSENKO was on the scene (but not directly in

touch with MALIA) when the introductions were made in a

terred on

raid

Moscow restaurant,

and from an observation polat in

nelekboring hotel room he watched the KGB agent and MALIA

having rolations.

With MALIA insisting on the lights being

turned off, however, it was impossible to obtain compro

mising photegraphs (tho KGB did not set have infra-red

photographic equipmont, NOSENKO said) and

therefore no re

crultrent approach

was made to MALIA. During this and a

inter trip to Moscow in 1961, MALIA was "very cautioug,"

and the KGB never again succeeded in exploiting MALIA'S

honosexuslity.for a recruitment approach.

Investigation Results:

MALIA, a U.S. Navy intolligence

officer during world war 11, has visited

the Soviet Union

1n 1955 and twice in 1962.

Thile buying books for the

Library of Congress and several universities in 1955, MALIA

travelled over 10,000 miles throughout the USSR, which was

sufficiently unusual at the time to attract press publicity.

In 1955 and 1962 he had contacts with dissident soviet

citizens and clandestinely brought to the lest llterature

for publishing abrord.

In December 1963 MALIA was the

subject of an attack in the Soviet press which charged that

during 1962 he had "spent his time in Moscow looking for

dissension in the ranks of young intellectuals at drutken

debauches."

in the spring of 1903 he claimed to have

had no involvements with blackmarketeers, horosexuals, or

females tuside the Soviet Union at any time.

thon about him.

b. Recruitment of BURGI (1956)

NOSENKO's Information: At the first meeting in 1962

and despite his stated fear for his own security and his

deternination to discuss only the tro leads hu wished to sell

CIA, NOSENKO described his recruitment of Yale Professor

Richard BURGI on the basis of a homosexual provocation

ation which began in Moscow and culinated with an approach

In Kiev in June

1956.

NOSENKO reported that he received a

letter of commendation (blagodarnost') and a bonus of one

month's pay for this recrultuent, büt in 1966 he retracted

this claim.

The BURGI case was

the first operation in which

NOSENKO had direct contact with a foreign target of the KGB,

and NOSENKO said he counted it

as a turning point in his

personal and professional life:

It was with this success-

ful operation, NOSENKO stated, that he "began to grow" fron

a spoiled playboy into a responsible and effective counter.

intelligence officer.

The BURGI operation was the first

rocruitment carried

out by the Tourist Department after 1t

was created in 1955, according to NOSENKO.

In 1964 NOSENKO

reported for the first time that his supertor, A.S. KOZLOV,

Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, had also taken part

In this operation, but that he, NOSENKO, was the responsible

case officer.

In

August 1965, when asked who had recruited

BURGI,

NOSENKO replied:

"KOZLOV and NOSENKO."

Asked who

recruited him first, NOSENKO said:

"KOZLOY, naturally.

He

was the Deputy Chief of the Department. The collection of

the materials (in preparation

for the approach) was in the

hands of Case Örficer NOSENKO. "

Because of the personal and

general significance ascribed to this operation by NOSENKO,

it is discussed in detatl here:

---

## Page 32

114.

In August 1965 NOSENKO reported that at the time of

BURGI'S

arrival in the USSR, his

file

contained a copy of

his visa application

(ankota), "naybe" an excerpt from a

cable sent by the Soviet Embassy in the United States saying

that a visa had been granted, a routine note from Inturist

giving BURGI's anticipated

date of arrival and his Itinerary

inside the Soviet Union, and the results of traces of the

general KGB Archives and of the First Chief Directorate

Archives.

NOSENKO hinself ran the traces, which proved to

be negative; there was no information on record concerning

SURGI, and since no other names were mentioned in the

naterial available on BURGI, no other

traces were made.

The

KGB interest in BURGI derived exclusively from

the fact that

he was a professor of Slavic studies

and therefore

had con-

tact with students who might sone day work

for

the U.s.

State Department,

Anorican Intelligence,

and

organizations.

other target

NOSENKO did not recall

who first suggested

an attempt to recruit hin.

BURGI arrived in the Soviet Union,

he came in

contact with a number of KGB agents,

and their reports were

placed in the unofficial file maintained by NOSENKO.*

SENKO could not recall in 1965 how nany such agents

have been, their names,

or what they might have reported

concerning BURGI.

(BURGI had en Inturist interproter but

NOSENKO did not know whether he was a KGB agent.)

source, name forgotten by NOSINKO, the KGB obtained indica-

was a homosexual, and it was decided to

try to obtain the grounds for recruitment by homosexual com-

NOSENKO therefore

approached Xu.A. LOPUKHOV, an

of the Britis' Department who handled the homosexual

agent Viktor BELAYOVSKIY, and asked permission to use his

agent in setting up the compromise.

After permission had

been received to mount an operation on this basis, LOPUKHOV

and NOSENKO met with BELANOVSKIY and instructed him to make

BURGI's acquaintance in a hotel dining room.

according

BELANOVSKIY met BURGI, the

of mutual homosexuality was recognized, and BURGI was

invited to BELANOVSKIY's hotel room where homosexual acts

took place and photographs were made.

NOSENKO was in

adjoining room and dirceted the compromise.

BURGI at this point, hoxever,

As the result of NOSENKO's special request,

the com-

promising photographs were ready by

the following day. A

report of the compromise and a request for permission

attempt recruitment were then submitted to NOSENKO's superiors.

The request came back with the approving signatures of O.M.

GRIBANOV and A.S. FEKLISOV, the Chief of the American Depart-

ment of the First Chief Directorate, which had expressed

interest in using BURGI in the United States.

BURGI's itin-

erary called for him to fly from Moscow to Kiev a short

while after this episode and,

having called the Kiev KGB with

instructions, NOSENKO and KOZLOV flew there the day before to

prepare the operation.

BURGI arrived the next morning and

was met at the airport by (fnu) KHODAKOVSKIY, an officer of

the Second Directorate in Kiev who operated under Inturist

cover.

NOSEYKO

was unable to recall how the car was ac-

quired, whether it was a KGB or Incurist vehicle, who the

driver

was, whether he was in the employ of the local KGB,

or other details.

In accordance with the operational plan, the local KGB

officer told BURGI encoute to the city that all the hotels

in Kiev were full at the moment because of various confer

ences, but that Inturist had

arranged for him to stay for

about

a day in a private apartment

in the conter

of town;

he would be moved to a hotel as soon as possible.

When

the

car arrived at the apartment building on Kreshchetik Ulitsa

in Kiev, NOSENKO,

KOZLOV, V.S. PETRENKO, a local KGB officer,

and (fnu) KASTYKAITE

a woman

housckerper,

were raiting for

them.

NOSENKO could

not remember how

O1'

whether he intro-

duced himself to BURGI.

The recruitment conversation,

he

said, was handled by

"KOZLOV-NOSEIKO," but NOSENKO had for-

gotten by 1965 who said what:

"I don't romember wat I

talked about and I don't remember what KoZLov talked about.

Many things were discussed.

It started with how he liked

his stay

inithe Soviet Union...

Then we slowly proceeded

to say

how

unfortunate

it was

that information had been re

ceived

about his

conduct in Moscow.

We told hin that his

homosexual activities were known,

that this was punishable

under Soviet law according to article. so-and-so of the

crininal code, etc., that he was not a diplomat, had no

diplomatic immunity, that he could be taken to court ac-

cording to the

Soviet 1aw...

Nell, he was scared, confused,

upset, and

felt uncomfortable.

Then we slowly proceeded to

jay that ald that could be smoothed out, but, you understand,

the basis was prepared for the man to say:

All right 1

agree to help.'...

We showed him the pictures. He was

embarrassed of course-she was naked.

Then we prepared the

basis:

'You have a noble task.

You teach; you have stu-

dents; the students might become future specialists

on

Russia or might work as diplomats, etc., but many of these

students could be used by intelligence.

They might be sent

somewhere with

special tasks.

Maybe you will tell us who

anong the students is preparing for government service,

how they are distributed,

etc.

During the first conver-

sation everything was made completely cloar...

He was not

at all willing to help or work for Soviet Intelligence.

He

was told that he must understand that in this case 'helping

Soviet Intelligence'

was a very broad term.

I remember that

I told him:

'Understand, nobody is going to ask you that

you help our friends

over there, or me, if I should be there,

or that you do anything bad or conduct any kind of subver.

sive activities, that you organize explosions or murder.'

After the Soviet Union, he was supposed to go to Italy,

to visit the Russicum

of the Vatican, and here KOZLOV

grabbed the subject and began to ask questions

about this

school.

He told us a bit about the Russicum

we asked

him to write about it and he wrote down some names of the

professors who teach

According to

NOSENKO, the discussion lasted about five hours; at its end

BURGI signed a short statement that he agreed "to assist

the organs of Soviet Intelligence."

NOSENKO first said that

it was

he who took this statement from BURGI but later said

he could not remember whether he or KOZLOV did this.

BURGI

was then taken to a hotel.

contact; the

second

or third time BURGl appeared and the New York Logal

Residency continued to meet with him until the Rerolution in

In late 1956.

NOSENKO later heard from soneone in

the ¿merican Department, first Chief Directorate that the

case was

(NOSESKO had

but he took no part in the confrontation or recruitment approach

"because DUBAS

although the recruit

ment was not firm, KRAFT and DUBAS

"hau an agreenent" that

nothing would be done about the compromise if KRAFT did not

DUBAS agair. con

file was turned over to the First Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO

récalied that the first Chief Directorate "said that KRAFT was

not in a good region of the United states.

Recruitment of DREW (1952)

an Aterican who

visited the Soviet Union in the spring of 1959, had originally:

been the responsibility of V.N. IVANOV, a case

officer of the

section dealing with American and Canadian tourists.

By chance,

however, DREW became involved with NOSENKO's homosexual agents

VOLKOV

and YEFREMOV (see Part V.D.2), and they reported this

to NOSINKO,

then the depuly chief

NOSENKO and

IVANOV discussed the case with DUBAS and possibly GUSKOV, the

section chief,

and NOSENKO flew alone to Leningrad to make the

approach.

(IVANOV was not considered to be sufficiently ex-

perienced and his English was not good.)

Note:

There is a similarity between NOSENiO's dessrip-

tien

of

the ban on recruitment approaches in 1959, which

prevented the Tourist Department fron taking advantage

of its compromising photography of BAlETT and HILLER

FORD, and informütion provided by the earlier defector,

GOLITSYN.

GOLITSYN reported that on imericon employed

at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, possibly a code cleri, was

prepared

for recruitment on the basis of homosexual com

promise during 1959 and 1960, according is information

he said he learned from U.s. Erbassy Section case offi-

cer.

G.I. GRYAZNOV, the KGB ha:!

choregraphs of the

American

in various stages of a homosexual

act, and

there was no question about the

recruitrent being achieved:

"The only question was to where." At the time, however,

SHELEPIN had just become Chairnan of the KGB and was ::

stressing ideological rather than blackmail recruitments.

He was shown these particular shotogranis but decided

that

an approach on their basis would be too crude and

that

another way should be found.

ilthough SHELEPIN did not

exclude the use of these photographs some time in the

future,

according to GOLITSYN,

he had reservations against

usirg them at that time for fear of the propaganda reper-:

cussions if the attempt should fail and be exposed pub-

licly.

GOLITSYN

did not know whether the recruitment was

subsequently carried out.

The essential differences: be

tween this account and that of NOSENKO are that GOLITSYN

implied the ban was in effect at least into 1960 and that

GOLITSYN appeared to le speaking of a general prohibition®

Whereas NOSENKO related the ban

specifically and only to

the U.S. Exhibition at Sokolniki Park which ended on

1 September 1959.*

Ir: speaking of the 1953 U.S. Exhibition at Sokolniki

Park, Moscow, Katam told

einst that both the

KGB

and the GRU launched an

-out effort to recruit

Americans employed at the Exhibition.

All officers

at GRU

Headquarters were

assigned to this task, and some were used

by the KGB in an attempt to compromise the Americans:

izing in American

What kinds of

approaches are taking place to our people in America and by

whom?

This is what interested us.

But he didn't know arything.

He couldn't say anything. He provided only superficial infor

mation, nothing more."

NOSENKO was then asked whether FRIPPEL would not have been

useFul for coverage;of Americans visiting the Soviet Union.

He replied that the KGB had already had great suecess in this

by other means and launched into a long

description of the

methods of covering foreign tourists in

the USSR.

NOSENKO was present in the adjoining room when FRIPPEL waS

compromised by a Soviet female agent, Klara Konstantinovna

NOSENKO described the compromising scene in detail

as well as

tures of these activities

confrontation with the militiamen who broke into the room.

130.

After returning to Geneva in 196% and during subseguent

debriefings and interrogations, NOSENKO made the following

additional staterents concerning the FRIPPEE case:

•. Although he had personally recruited FRIPPEL, he

did not do so

alone; Col. V.D.

CHELNOKOV, Deputy Chief

(and later Chief) of the

Tourist Department, was present;

he and NOSENKO "carried out the recruitrent together" in

early September 1959. NOSENKO was, hcwever, FRIPPEL'S

case officer.

- NOSENKO

attricuted his involvement in the FRIPPEL

recruitment to

the

following:

"In 1953, after 1958,

when I became the Deputy Chief of the section, my area

of activity was narioned down.

I didn't handle all the

tourists at that time. I worked as the Deputy Chief of

the section and I had

my own little area--for example, the

permanent representative of the Americar. E:press Company,

and besides that I began to collect all the material on

all American tourist firms which have anything to do with

Inturist and who send tourists to the U'SSR."

- FRIPPEL never provided any information of value to

Soviet tourist operations.

- When NOSENKO began to work in the U.S. Embassy

Section of the American Department in 1960, he took FRIPPEL

with hin because FRIPPEL was acquainted with some Ameri-

cans at the Embassy.

NOSENKO was

asked to question FRIPPEL

about the U.S. Erbassy and such Embassy officers as George

MINTERS and Lewis W. BOWDEN, but FRIPPEL never told NOSENKO

anything along this line.*

- FRIPPEL provided no interesting information during

NOSENKO's two meetings with him in 1962 and 1963, when

FRIPPEL returned to the Soviet Union as a tour guide.

- NOSENKO met "pretty steadily" with FRIPPEL during

the period to January 1961, and once NOSENKO and his wife,

in company with CHELNOKOV and his wife, had dinner at

FRIPPEL'S home, where they met Mrs. FRIPPEL.

Odette

FRIPPEL was unaware of her husband's status as a KGB agent,

and therefore NOSENKO and CHELNOKOV used Inturist cover

for their acquaintance with FRIPPEL.

Although unusual for

KGB Second Chief Directorate case officers to visit agents

in their homes with wives present, NOSENKO explained that

he went because he

"was invited,"

and CHELNOKOV went "be-

cause he was also involved in the recruitment."

- First as Deputy Chief of a section of the Tourist

as Deputy Chief and Acting Chief of

the U.S. Embassy Section of

the American Department,

NOSENKO continued to meet with FRIPPEL in Moscow hotels

and restaurants.

Throughout this period, he was almost

invariably accompanied by CHELNOKOV:

"Perhaps one time

I met with FRIPPEL alone, otherwise it was always with

CHELNOKOV. "

Usually NOSENKO would arrange these meetings

with FRIPPEL at CHELNOKOV's request and the two continued

co meet with FRippel, despite his lack of production, be

cause they "kept hoping he would give somezhing."

In a

different context, but speaking of CHELNOKOV, NOSENKO ex-

"You see, never mind if you are a chief or a

deputy chief of

department, you must have one,

two, or

three agents.

GRIBANOV insists,

so that you don't forget

how to work.

The Chiefs of the (Second Chief) Director-

demand that they have i2 or 13 agents, but they

must have two or three.

They will have important agents

or those in leading positions."

- NOSENKO continued to act as FRIFPEL's case officer

FRIPPEL had left the Soviet Union and NOSENKO had

been transferred and promoted to the position of Deputy

Chief of the Tourist Department.

He met twice with FRIP

PeL during this latter period when FRIPPEL

Both of these meetings were handled by NUSENKO alone, with-

• The first meeting took place in the sumner of 1962,

had arrived in the soviet Union as a guide for some Ameri

can journalists.

(NOSENKO was unable to give the compo

sition

of the journalist group or to recall where they

stayed in Moscow and where else they travelled in the Sov-

iet Urion.)

NOSENKO contacted him in Moscow to learn what

questions

the newsmen intended to ask KHRUSHCHEV during

a scheduled interview; subsequently NOSENKO acknowledged

that

standard practice required visiting journalists to

submit their intended questions for KHRUSHCHEV in writing

to Soviet authorities prior to interviews.

After the

interview, he recontacted FRIPPEL to learn the reaction

of the journalists to their talk with

the Soviet leader.

NOSENKO could not recall their specific reaction to the

KHRUSHCHEV interview but did remember that they were

"satisfied:"

Another reason

for contacting FRIPPEL,

NOSENKO added in a later discussion, was to learn whether

any of the journalists might have joined the group at the

last moment

United States, which

might suggest

intelligence connections on their part.*

- NOSENKO met. FRIPPEL alone for the second and last

time during March 1963.

Since FRIPPEL was a quide for

tourists aboard the ship "Olympia," which stopped for a

day in Yalta and Odessa,

NOSENKO flew to Odessa from Mog-

cow and accosted FRIPPEL in the lobby of the hotel where

the tourists were having dinner. Finally able to get away

NOSENKO had earlier said on several occasions that one of

the things KGB sources in foreign tourist companies abroad

were instructed to report to the KGB was any last-minute

tour group to the USSR; this might signify

intelligence affiliation.

from his group, FRIPPEL called on ROSENKO in the latter's

hotel room, and the two drank and talked.

NOSENKO had

given FRIPPEL a bottle of vocka as a gift,

maid he wanted

to give NOSENKO some whiskey in return.:

They drove in NOSENKO's car to the port, where NOSENKO

During this contact, TRIPPEL reported "nothing of

On 3 February 1964,

asked about the following

passage which appeared in the AGD operational plan

BOWDEN, dated robruary 1960 und signed cy !.A. KUSKOV of

the. b.s. Embassy Suction: "In IDOWDLM) shered himsclf

SaMerOVA Ithe fact of! "aRrUl's" affiliation with Ameri-

can Irteiligence."***

NOSENKO confirmed that the "ARTUR"

of the CHinEPaNOW pagors was PRIPPEl, but he said he

"could not say" whether ipippas had any affiliation with

American Intelligence.

VOSENKO saId he later read a report that FRIPPEL had been

reassigned, and

it was therefore unlikely that his agent

would return to Moscow; this report was submitted by

V.V. KOSTYRYA (alias VLADIMIROV), a member of the KGB Legal

Residency and overtly an Inturigt

employce in New York City,

who was a former socond Chief Directorate colleague of

NOSENKO.

The CHEREPANOV Papers are discussed in detail in Part

VI. D.7.C.

There is no other report of BOWDEN makiny such a remark

and no basis for it.

While in the Soviet Union ir August 1962

and shortly be

fore his recruitment on homosexual grounds see Part

VI.D.2.), the American Spencer RUBERTS was approached on

the beach at Sochi by a young Soviet male.

ROBERTS and

the Soviet, who spoke French,

soon became

friends, and

the Soviet told ROBERTS that

he had been used as an agent

in several operations

against French-speaking foreigners

in the USSR.

One of these was FRIPPEL,

the Soviet said,

adding that FRIPPEL was suspected by the KGB of being an

American Intelligence agent.

NOSENKO, who has provided

much detail on the ROBERTS case, did not mention the

unidentified Soviet in this context or while discussing

FRIPPEL.

6. Lee Harvey OSWALD (1959-60 and 1963)

As in the FRIPPEL case, NOSENKO was involved with lee

Harvey OSWALD during both periods of his assignment to the

Tourist Department of the

Second Chief Directorate (1955-

1960 and 1962-1964).* While Deputy Chies öf the Anerican-

British-Canadian Tourist, Section, NOSENKO had a direct hind

in the decision in October 1959 that USWALD has of no opera

ational interest to tha KCB And should be returned immediately

to the United States.

Before President Kennedy's assassi

nation in November 1963, when NOSENKO was again in the

Tourist Department as its Deputy. Chief, he nas present at the

time the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned of OSWALD'S

application to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to re-enter

the USSR.

After the assassination, he also played a role in

the KGB investigations of OSWALD'S

activities during residence

in the Soviet Union fron Octover 1959 untii June 1903.

Collateral information relating to OSWALD's stay

in the

Soviet Union, and particularly concerning any connections he

may have had

with Soviet intelligence,

meager and indirect.

It derives almost entirely from indications ef

primary

interest by the KGB (among all Soviet Government organs) in

every desector to the USsk, and from infererces which may be

drawn from certain entries

in OSwAlD's "Historical Diary" anc

during inter-

certain statements made by his wife, Marina fret President

views on behalf of the Warren Commission.

Kennedy's death, the Soviet Government provided

the United

States with official documents and letters pertaining to

OSWALD's defection to the USSK, his suicide attempt, his

marriage, and other events inside the Soviet Union.

This

information from the Soviet Government generally agrees with

the information fron NOSENKO. The materials furnished by

the Soviet Government make no mention a any Soviet Intel-

ligence interest, or lack thereof, in OSWALD.

In this sense NOSENKOs information is unique:

It was

and remains the only

such information

available

on the 32

months of OSWALD's life in the USSR.**

NOSENKO'S access to

• For continuity of presentation,

both periods of NOSENKO s

alleged involvement, 1959-1960 and 1963, are discussed in

this part of the paper.

#*. Independent sources,

however,

reported on visits by OSWALD

to tho soviet and Cuban

Embassies in Mexico City between 29

September and § October 1963 and on his (apparently overt) con-

tact with a KGB officer under Consular cover at the Soviet

Embassy there.

NOSENKO originally said he knew nothing of any

such contact.

In October 1966 he revised this to say that

OSWALD did not have contact with the KGB in Mexico City, NOSENKO

explained that he had been sitting in the office of Tourist De-

partment Chief, K.N. DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head-

quarters from

the KGB legal Residency in Mexico: The cable,

which NOSENKO said he did not personally see, reported that

oswALD had visired the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City requesting

vermission to return to the USSR and that he had dealt wit:

Soviet Foreion Ministry personnel onty.

Statements to ClA

On the basis of the Ful intorviews of NOSENKO and the

sinilar infornation which he has previously provided ClA,

further debriefings were conducted by Cli on

3 and 2". July

1964.

Now and explanatory information received Juring these

debriefings is presented below:

(1) KGB Interest in OSKALD

Until CSWALD mentioned to the lazurist guide nis desire

to remain in the Soviet Union, he was treated routinaly by

the KCB.

When OSWALD mide his

request, this was reported

innediately to the Tourist Department,

and it was from this

moment that the KGB began to pay attention to hin.

A11

available naterials on him were tercupon collected and

examined--the visa application, Inturist reports,

interpreters'

TEDOItS

reports fros

hotel agents.

ind the rasults of a

check of KGB Archives.

KRUPNOV interviewed the interpreter

to whom OSKALD had stuted his desire.

Although the KGB con-

sidered it possible that OSWALD might be an

American agent,

the KGB did nothing to investigate this possibility as

ithis

would be done

after

the person

is allowed to stay in the

Soviet Union."

Surveillance of OSWALU was not increased

after his request, and OSWALD was not interviowed by the

KGS in an attempt

to establish his intentions.

There was

no attempt to debrief OSiVALD because

"he was not an inter-

esting person and wasn't normal."

OSWALD was never questloned

on his past nor asked to write an autobiography.**

From the

* NOSENKO provided details on this point to ClA (see below) and

developmental target) and then emigrate to England; See Part V.D.3.

materials

and reports immediately available it was decided

that something wes not quite normal about siA,

and the

sub therefore had Inturist tell him that he would have e

leave the USSR when ais vIsa expired. OSMALD's suicide

attempt supported the Tourist Department's feelirg that

it had been

right in deciding to refuse OSKALD's request

for citizenship, particularly as the hospital also re

ported that he was not normal, and the Tourist Department

decided:

"We will do nothing; we

don't want to know him."

Inturist was suusequently told: ""There is no KGB interest

In him.

Do what you want.

The KGB thought that he was

of no interest for the country or for the KGB, that he was

not normal, and that he should leave the country."

The

Tourist Department and the KSB in general thereupon "washed

their hands" of this natter.

There was never any

operational use of OSWALD nor was

there anything

in OSkALD's file to indicate that the KGB

attempted to debrief him on his past service in the U.S.

Marine Corps or other matters; this was because "he is a

very little person and also it is felt that he is not nor

mal, so the KGB is afraid to do this with him."*

The GRU

was not informed of OSWALD's defection.

Neither was any

attempt made to exploit OSWALD for propaganda purposes

in Moscow or in Minsk:

In short, there was no incelligence

interest or contact with OSWALD after the initial assess-

ment of abnormality.

(li) KGB Interest in Marina OSWALD

The KGB had no linowledge or interest in Marina (nee

PRUSAKOVA) until she and OSWALD applied for permission to

register marriage.

In fact the KGB did not know that she

was a friend of OSWALD until this point, for there was no

surveillance on OSWALD to show that he knew her.

When the

KGB learned of their relationship, checks were made of the

Archives of the Minsk KGB as well

as neighborhood.checks and

checks at her place of employment.

The people where she

lived and worked and went to school considered her a simple

girl, not very clever, only fair in her studies,

not an active

member of the KOMSOMOL.

She was a simple "philistine," an

uncultured girl more interested in gossip than ir anything

important. The KGB never considered recruiting her as an

informant on OSWALD "because it was considered dangerous to

recruit a wife to report on her husband." Nor was it con-

sidered to recruit her for use after she arrived in the

United States,

"because she would tell him and also. she

would probably.tell the Americans,, based on the assessment

of the type of person she was."

(111) OSWALD's Marriage and Departure from the USSR

NOSENKO was asked why there were so few difficulties

in the way of Marina's marriage to a foreigner and her

departure from the Soviet Union.

le replied:

-"The Soviet

law allows any Soviet citizen to marry a foreigner.

It was

* YOSENKO subsequently defined this

KGB reservation about

OSWALD as fear of becoming involved with an unstable pei-

son•

## Page 61

easy In this case because OSWALD was already living and

working in the Soviet Union.

It would be sore difficult,

of course, with sourists or others who are in the Soviet

Union only for a short period and want to marry Soviet

citizens.

•* : Asked whether it is not unusully difficult

for Soviet citizens to leave the Soviet Union, NOSENKO

explained:

"In this case it was easier because Marina

was already married to a Töreigner."

NOSENÄO was next

asked what office or level of the Government or Party

must make the final decision regarding Marina's marriage

tO OSKALD.

He described the procedure as follows: "They

would come to the Regional Registration Office to apply

to register their marriage.

(There) they will be told

that they will have to wait a week of two while they think

it over to be sure they want to get married.

During this

period the necessary checks are conducted.

The Regional

Office would call the Militia, and the Militia would call

the Minsk KGB.

The Minsk: KGB

said that it is all right

for them to got married--that the KGB has no objection.

But

it is the law that allows them to be married. There

are no formal approvals necessary."

Concerning the decision to permit the couple to leave

the USSR,

NOSENKO said on 3 July 1964 that the decision

would be made on the local level, in Minsk, and that there

is no need to check in Moscow.

1964 he corrected

oc a here.

this statement to say that, while local authorities make

the decision,

it must be approved in Moscow by, he thought,

the Ministry

for the Preservation of Public Order (MOOP).

(IV) OSWALD'S Visit to Soviet Embassy in Mexico

Asked whether he had

any information on OSWALD's visit

to ::xico in September 1963, NOSENKO said that he knew oniy

that OSWALD had applied at the Soviet Embassy there to come

to the Soviet Union.

The Mexico City Legal Residency of the

KGB reported his visit to Headquarters by cable, requesting

inforra:ion; this was

the first that the KGB First Chief

Directorate had heard

of OSWALD.

that ALEKSEYEV then came to V.D. CHELNOKOV or A.G. KOVALENKO

to ask about OSALD, and YOSENKO thought that he himself was

present at the time.

ALEKSEYEV was given the background on

OSWALD, including his suicide attempt and the fact that he

was not considered normal, and was told to advise the First

Chief Directorate that OSWALD should not be permitted to re-

enter the Soviet Union.

ALEKSEYEV then telephoned TURALIN

to relay this message.

NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD

had spoken at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and he knew

"By the time OSwALD applied for permission to marty, he had

already written the American Embassy in Moscow, through Soviet

(V) NOSEYKO's Comments on Possible KGB Involverent in the

Assassination

When first discussing

the OSWALD case with YOSENKO on 23

January 1964, a CIA case officer commented: "It is a very un-

tortunate thing that these prior events occurred in the Soviet

Union,"

(NOSENKO apparently misunderstood the case officer's

intent, which was not to imply that the NGB has behind the

ssassination, but only that tho face of OSwALD's "defection"

placed

the USSR under probaby aroundeu suspicion.) NOSENKO'S

immediate response to this remark

was:

"That is not correct.

This is putting a false color to it.

Superv.sosy.Responsibiditien.and: Knowledge-of Tourist

Operations

Information from NOSENKO

In June 1958 there was a reorganization within the Tourist

Department of the Second Chief Directorate.

The Second Section,

which had theretofore concerned itself with operational activity

against foreign

tourists from all countries, was broken down into

separate sections; one section dealt with tourists from the United

States, Canada, and Great Britain, the other with tourists from

Europe, Latin America, and all other countries.

NOSENKO said

that he was promoted at this time to the position of Deputy Chief

of the first of these new sections.

NOSENKO's involvement in at least one major case, Lee Harvey

OSWALD, stems entirely from his having held this position.

It

is also on this basis that he was able to claim awareness of all

recruitments from among American tourists from mid-1958 until he

returned to the American

Department at the beginning of 1960.

His knowledge about recruitments

is based additionally, he

said,

on the fact that some time between lay and October 1959, during

the tourist season, he was ordered by Ye. S. KIRPICHNIKOV,

GRIBANOV's secretary, to gather facts for GRIBANOV concerning the

use of tourist cover

by foreign intelligence organizationg during

the period from 1955 through 1958.

NOSENKO gathered this material

from earlier

annual reports of the Tourist Department and by talk-

ing with various case officers in the department.*

On the basis of his general and supervisory experience in

the Tourist Department as well as his research for this paper,

NOSENKO had the following to say about Tourist Department opera-

tions prior to 1960 (taken

from the protocol he signed on this

subject on 25 February 1965) :

"Operations against tourists were developing slowly

during this period and very little was known by the KGB

about the use of tourism by American Intelligence at the

time I wrote the report in 1959.

No agents were definitely

uncovered among American tourists during the years 1958 or

1959 and, until 1960, no tourists were

'caught in the act'

of mailing letters, servicing deaddrops or contacting

agents, except one whose name I remember as McGUIRE.

Questioned on this paper in February 1965, NOSENKO said he

did not remember whether he discussed it with GRIBANOV, nOr

could he recall any examples of the material he included in

it, what the paper said about CIA

tourist operations, or what

other U.S. Intelligence organizations were using tourism

as

• an operational cover in this period. He did remember,. how

ever.

that it incorporated statistical data on the growth

of foreign tourism.

b.: KGB Knowiedge from George ELANE

During the first week of June 1959, a three-day meeting was

held in Londor, England, between representatives of CIA and the

British Secret Intelligence Service

(sis, commonly referred to as

MI-6)

on the subject of legal-travel" intelligence operations

against the USSR.

At the conclusion of this meeting there was

drawn up a 19 page document summarizing what had been discussed

at the meetings.

This summary spelleù out CIA operational doc-

trine pertaining to tourist operasions; including

agent-sporting

techniques, criteria for agent selection, agent

assessment,

agent

training,

and tasks to be carried out

by tourist agents during

the coming (1959)

tourist seasor.

It

stressed CIA's reliance

on tourists for the spotting.

recontacting, assessing, and

communicating with clandestine assets in the Soviet Union. A

copy of the document as well, presunably, as other British doeu-

ments relating to the joint meetings was glven to George BLAKE,

who has admitted having made a phorographic copy which he passed

to the KGB. He gave the KGB this information in the summer of

1959.

# One Robert Alan MCGUIRE, a forner: staff empioyce of CIA, :

travelled to the Soviet Union as a tourist during April and

May 1958.

Although he was debriefed on his return, he had

no connection with CIA in preparation for this trip and

mailed no letters for CIA inside

the USSR,

While in the

Soviet Union, McGUIRE was approached on numerous occasions

by Soviets

seeking blackmarket deals., American girls, and

assistance in defecting to the Americans.

While en route to

Leningrad, his brief case was overtly searched by a customs

employee,

who confiscated a Radio Liberation script.

McGUIRE

reported that he was compelled to sign a document which stated

that the script had been confiscated,

but the reasons for the

action were left blank.

NOSENKO,

who has reported none of

these details,

MCGOWAN,

appears to have confused McGUIRE with Edward

a CIA agent who mailed a letter in Minsk in August

1958 and was detected doing so by the KGB; NOSENKO said

MCGUIRE mailed a letter in Minsk in 1959.

In

October 1966, in answer to a specific question, NOSENKO stated

that ARTEMOV never had any connection with the

he left Kiev and later in Yalta.' He was approached on 17 Novem

services despite his refusal, and on 18 November by a girl in

Tbilisi who occupied a seat next to his in a theater and made

similar overtures.

GRAY was also approached by blackmarketeers

and by purportedly disaffected young men.

On 13 November he

was arrested in Stalingrad while photographing industrial in-

stallations and was released

after interrogation and confiscation

of his film.

NOSENKO made no references to GRAY.

The KGB document elsewhere states:

"A guide of a tourist

group, John Milton FRANCIS, born 1934, an instructor of Russian

at a college of Yale University, when in Odessa with a group of

tourists--American students--separated himself from the group

and travelled through the city alone.

In a notebook which was

lost by him, notes and sketches were found which pointed to the

fact that he utilized his trip for the purpose of selecting

suitable places for the placing of deaddrops, or for checking

those deaddrops which were earlier selected by American agents.

In Moscow he selected routes which were used. to check and dis

discover the existense of surveillance, utilizing passable backyards

and following skillful methods.

At the present time FRANCIS is

the chief irterpreter of the State. Department, servicing Soviet

delegations in the USA."

FRANCIS did have such

a mission in 1958 and brought back a

notebook with sketches of the sites he selected. He did not

mention losing his notebook.

In 1954 and 1955 FRANCIS was in

frequent contact with V.V. KKIVOSHEY in Berlin; KRIVOSHEY, who

there until the late 1950's, has been identified as a KGB

First Chief Directorate officer who later became an officer in

the Correspondents Department, KGB. Second Chief Directorate.*

FRANCIS was also a student of Richard BURGI at Yale in 1956, the

year that NOSENKO was involved in BURGI's recruitment (see Part

v.D.4.b.).

NOSENKO has not mentioned the FRANCIS case and did

not recognize his name.

KRIVOSHEY was a participant in the Sgt. Robert Lee JOHNSON

case to which NOSENKO provided the lead (see Part VI.D.3.c.).

I January 1960

to January: 1962 (American Department)

1. Introduction

NOSENKO claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the U.S.

Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB Second Chief

Directorate.

from sometime in January 1960 until the first days

of January 1962.* This section, in his words, was working

against "the most important counterintelligence target in the

Soviet Union, " the permanent American representation in Moscow.

It regarded every American stationed there as a possible spy

and, simultaneously, as a target for eventual compromise and

recruitment.

The functions of the U.S. Embassy Section were described by

NOSENKO as being, first, to control all contacts by ambassy per-

sonnel with Soviet citizens; second, to evaluate information

collected from all possible sources on American Embassy employees:

and third,. to use this information as a basis for planning and

carrying out recruitment approaches.

The Americans' personal-

ities, Jobs, personal relationships:

daily routines,

security precautions, contacts with

major and minor scandals in their Moscow lives formed the basis

for this "ork.

To gather such information, the section's officers

directed and debriefed large numbers of agents and informants.

including the indigenous employees of the Embassy, Soviet citizeng

moving in Embassy social circles, and third-country nationals with

American contacts, the officers also assigned tasks to and assim-

Ilated the reports from the numerous surveillance teams at their

disposal, and

they read and tried to exploit materials from tele-

phone taps and microphones placed in the offices and homes of

the Americans.

Each officer had a limited number of American

targets and attempted to become thoroughly familiar with ach:

annually, they submitted detailed operational plans to exploit

the knowledge they had gained of their target.

During 1960 and

1961, NOSENKO said, special emphasis was placed within the section

"identifyirg intelligence officers at the Embassy and active

development of them, the acquisition of ciphers, and the detailed

and painstaking study of code clerks, creating the conditions on

the basis of which they can be recruited."

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO has said, he had

access to all information concerning its activities:

"Nothing

was hidden" from him.

On this basis, he expressed certainty

that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB did not recruit any Americans

associated with the Embassy, that no Americans assigned to the

Embassy were being handled in Moscow as KGB agents in this

period, and that.

in fact, the KGB had recruited no American

Embassy personnel

since

With his fellow officers of 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO has also

claimed certainty that there were no XGB recruitments from the

time he left the section in January 1962 until the January 1964

trip to Geneva.

In debriefing and interrogating NOSENKO, CIA placed partic-

ular emphasis on his activities during the period January

1960 to January 1962, since this information was of special

importance to

U.S. Government security.

See Part VI.D.3.b. for a discussion of the case of the KGB

agent "ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH), whose recruitment has been

variously dated by NOSENKO between the years 1949 and 1953.

meanwntle, no one replaced NOSENKO"S" Deputy Chiet ep"che

Tourist Department's American Section because (as he explained:

on 29 January 1965) the Tourist Department, which had earlier

operated against members of delegations and various other

categories of foreign visitors, was being reorganized in January

1960 for work against tourists alone and the Deputy Chief slot

was eliminated."

With the exception of A. A. DMITRIYEV, Marina

RYTOVA,

and

the homosexuals YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, NOSENKO turned

over all of his agents

to another officer in the section named

TIMOFEYEV.

NOSENKO said on 29 January 1965 that he had two

separate files on his agent Arsene FRIPPEL, a developmental tile

and an operational file, and that he turned the former over to

TIMOFEYEV. and the latter to V. D. CHELNOKOV, Deputy Chief of the

Tourist Department.

During later interrogations, however, NOSENKO

hae said that he continued to handle FRIPPEL while in the U.s.

Embassy Section and was

the case officer during FRIPPEL'S visits

to the

Soviet Union in 1962 and 1963.**

NOSENKO's Transfer to the U.S. Embassy Section

In December 1959, While serving as Deputy Chief of the

American-British-Canadian Section of the Tourist Department,

NOSENKO learned from K. N. DUBAS, the department Chief, of

to transfer him to the U.S. Embassy Section as Deputy Chief.

NOSENKO said he was opposed to the move and wanted to remain in

the Tourist Department:

"I was used to it there and wanted to

continue.

I wanted to stay in the Tourist Department.

[the transfei/ was no promotion.

Here I was the Deputy Chief

and would be the same there.

But, of course, its more

important there.

The American Department is, of course, the most

important.

But here I was working against Ameriçan tourists.

This is also important.

self there in '55,

'56, '57, '58, and '59 and was considered to

be not a bad case officer.

And here, in the American Department.

I must show prove/ myself with new people."

asked DUBAS in December 1959 to "please fight for me to stay."

DUBAS later told NOSENKO that he had twice spoken to Second

Chief Directorate Chief O. M. GRIBANOV on his behalf, but to

no avail.

In January 1960 the official orders transferring

NOSENKO were issued.

On the day NOSENKO reported to V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the

American Department, to begin his new job, he was told to report

to GRIBANOV's office.

TO GRIBANOV

NOSENKO again expressed mis-

givings about the change of assigment.

GRIBANOV replied that

DUBAS had spoken to him about this but that he, GRIBANOV, "had

his own plans and that was all." GRIBANOV told NOSENKO that

**

There was no change in the functions of NOSENKO's section,

however; as before, it continued to be responsible for

operations against

tourists from the United States,

England, and Canada.

FRIPPEL has reported that NOSENKO: continued to meet him

until he left the Soviet Union, in January 1961 and again

when he returned as a guide to tourist groups twice in

1962 and once again in 1963; see Part V.D.5.

NOSENKO was asked on 17 April 1964 whom he had relieved

upon reporting for duty in the U.S. Embassy Section.

He replied:

"Nobody."

He was then asked to identify the persons from whom

he had assumed certain of his duties as Deputy Chief of the

section (these are discussed in detail below). NOSENKO said that

he took the responsibility for maintaining the section file on

the security of

v. M. KOVSHUK **Che U.S. Embassy from the Chief of the section,

Regarding his responsibility as case officer

NOSEVKO explained that be-

cause former Security Officer Russell LANGELLE had been declared

persona non grata in October 1959 and because his successor john

was not to arrive until March 1960, no ore in the section

had this responsibility wher he,

NOSENKO, arrived in January

Asked who had been LAiGELLE's case officer, NOSENKO IE

plied: "LANGELLE was handled by several people - by La.SJ MALYU-

GIN, then after that by /V,A,/ KUSKOV, then by KOVSHUK, then

GOLITSYN also comnented on this subject

work was particularly intensified after the appointment of

SHELEPIN to the KGB...

In 1960, it was recommended

KGB to intensify the work against the Americans at the U.S.

Embassy in Moscow, and against American colonies in other

countries...

This question of intensifying work against the

Americans

was up before the Collegium of the KGB.

Thereafter,

there was a directive from SHELEPIN regarding the intensifi-

cation of work against the Anerican cipher-clerks."

**There is an apparent contradiction between NOSENKO's desig-

nation of KOVSHUK as Chief of the First (U.S. Ebassy) Sec

tion in 1960 and information earlier supplied by GOLITSYN.

GOLITSYN told CIA of a conversation he had with KOVSHUK in

, January 1961 in Moscow (see Part V,E. 3.c.2. concerning a

recruitment approach to the American code clerk James STORS-

BERG) but at that time described KOVSHUK only as an American

Department officer,

without indicating his position.

only time that GOLITSYN has given a position for KOVSHUK was

context of questioning concerring KHRUSHCHEV's "Secret

Speech" denouncing STALIN in 1956; GOLITSYN: said that at this

time KOVSHUK was Chief of the American Department (sic) of

the Second Chief Directorate,

On 16 February 1962 GOLITSYN

identified Vladimir PETROV as Chief of the "section concerned

with the American Embassy of the

American Department of the

Second Directorate:

in 1960,,

NOSENKO had identified PETROV

as Chief of the Second Section of the American Department,

which was concerned with the penetration of U.S. intelligence

operations inside the Soviet Union.

LANGELLE was betore my tIme.

"Two months" later,

on

24 June 1964, NOSEYKO stated:

"In 1959 and possibly in 1958,

Mikhail Fedorovich BAKHVALOV was the Deputy Chief of the U.s:

Embassy Section.

I replaced him in this position in 1960 and

he went to the Fifth (Eastern Countries) Department as Deputy

Chief®"*

On 8 September 1964 NOSENKO volunteered for the first

time that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief of the section, had been

the case officer for LANCELLE.

• Under interrogation

in early

1965, NOSENKO added that BAKHVALOV had also been responsible for

maintaining the file on the security of the U.S. Embassy.

At

this time he explained his earlier statement by saying that BAKH-.

VALOV had left the section before his arrival and had given the

file to KOVSHUK to hold for his successor:

The file continued to

be charged officially to BAKHVALOV, however, even though he was

no longer in the section, and NOSENKO arranged for the official

change of custody shortly after reporting for duty (see Part V.E.

3. f.).

NOSENKO said further, in January 1965, that BAKHVALOV

had shared responsibility for supervising code clerk operations

with KOVSHUK before NOSENKO arrived to assume these duties him-

self.

NOSENKO had been given a rumber of opportunities prior

to 24 June 1964 to identify BAKHVALOV as his predecessor, but

he did not do so.

These are summarized below:

"The Chief of this department is Colonel Artem DAVIDYAN.

27 February 1964: NOSENKO was shown a photograph of V.A.

ALEKSEYEV, a Soviet who was in Japan from July to September.

1961 as a

member of a trade delegation.

NOSENKO inmediately

recognized the face as that of the Deputy Chief of the Fifth

Department of the Second Chief Directorate.

He said that he

did not know this person's last name.

but that his first name

and patronymic were Mikhail Fedorovich.

when shown the last

name ALEKSEYEV, NOSE:KO recognized it as an alias, but pro-

vided no further information concerning his true identity or

earlier service in the American Department.

10 June 1964: NOSENKO was asked to list in writing the

On this basis: NOSENKO was then

provided 14 names, but BAKHVALOV'S was not among them.

to name the officers who had left the section in the same period,

he named five, again omitting BAKHVALOV.

Duties and Knowledgeability

: Me

Introduction

Shortly after reporting for duty in the U.S. Embassy

Section and following his short discussion with GRIBANOV,

NOSENKO met with Department Chief KLYPIN and Section Chief

KOVSHUK to discuss

his responsibilities

and functions in

the section.

Repeating what GRIBANOV had already

said,

KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's eost important single respon-

sibility. in the section would be supervision of all KGB

operational activity against American military and State

Department code clerks stationed in Moscow.

As for the

other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN suggested a division

of labor under which KOVSHUK

would be responsible for super

vising operations against State Departrent personnel and

NOSENKO would supervise work against the Arny, Air Force,

and Naval attaches and their assistants.*

NOSENKO was also

made responsible for maintaining certain files in the section.

On 19 February 1965 NOSENKO signed an interrogation proto.

col which he agreed contained a listing of his

principal

responsibillites during 1960 and 1961. It read in part:

"During the egtire

Punctions as General Deputy and Acting Chief of Section

41) Access

Since his defection NOSENKO has maintained under re

peated interrogation that as general deputy to KOVSIUK, with

the responsibility of taking over in KOVSHUK's absence, he

had acces: to all information on the section's activities

and was obliged to keep

current on this information.

this basis he has been able to assure his questioners that

the KGB was completely unsuccessful in its attempts to re-

cruit Americans assigned to the Embassy in these two years.

NOSENKO has also said at various times that his access to

section files and his discussions with section officers made

it certain that there were also no successes from 1953 to

1960 and from January 1962 to January 1964.

His statements

on this subject during the February 1965 were distilled in

a protocol which NOSENKO signed on 20 February (quoted in

full):

-. "1.. As the only Deputy to the Chief of the

American Embassy Section,

First Department,

Second

Chief Dircetorate, KGB, Vladislav Mikhaylovich KOV

SHUK, from January 1960 to January 1962, one of my

func

tions was to serve as KOVSHUK's general deputy and to

assume the rights and

responsibilities of Chief of the

Section during KOVSHUk's absence.

In order to perform

this function I had the right and the obligation of

knowing the details about every important activity of

the section against the American Embassy and its per-

sonnel. No activity of this nature was withheld from

me.

"2.

As Deputy Chief of the Section I know defi-

nitely that no U.S. officials serving in the Embassy

were agents of the

KGB or reporting unofficially in

any way to the KGB during my service in the Section.

There were no approaches or recruitments made by the

Section during

the period January 1960 to January 1962

against personnel of the American Embassy,

including

personnel of the State Department, the offices of the

Military Attaches (Army, Navy,

and Air), the Department

0f Agriculture and USIA, including Marine guards, Army

sergeants,

clerks except against STORSBERG and KEYSERS, both un-

successful approaches.

•(11) Duties

On 29 January 1965, NOSENKO was questioned concerning

his supervisory duties as Deruty Chief of the section, par-

ticularly his function of supervising activity against code

clerks.

The transcript of this discussion is quoted here:

No, I can't say.

Fifty per cent or 75 per cent?

I can't answer you.

What about your functions as

gard to salehouses, to "K.K.'s" and "Ya.K.'s",*

Oh.

I myself had a file on my flat, a yavochnaya

Seventh

[Tourist Department).

It was my own.

GRYAZNOV

KOSOLAPOV had

also his own

us had a conspiratIve apartment.

And you took the "Ya.K."' from...

(Interrupting.)

Which I had from the Seventh.

And, by

the way, when

I was leaving the First

American Department, I took this file again

to the Seventh.

And not one of you had a conspirative flat.

No, because the section had only-how many?--

[P.I. | MASSYA had one conspirative.

[V.P.]

FEDYANIN had one conspirative, and then there was

one conspirative flat, where,

in fact, an agent

was living.

In the First Section there were

three or four conspirative flats.

But among you, GRYAZNOV, and KOSOLAPOV there was

none?

Only "Ya.K.'s".

#А "K.K." (konspirativnaya kvartira-conspiratorial apart-

ment)

is delined by NOSENKO as a safehouse or apartmen't owned

and maintained by

the KGB. A "Ya.K." (yavochnaya kvartira-

meeting apartment) is an apartment occupied by a tenant ho

le perhaps subsidized by the KGB and absents himself when

there is a need to use the apartment for meetings or other

activities.

The

"K.K." is used for more sensitive operational

purposes, he said.

No.

Besides that, very

often we were using rooms in hotels.

So GRYAZNOV would take any of his operational

activity to his "Ya.K."?

He would also meet with his agents, with his

operational contacts in hotel rooms.

No,

no.

They don't have to report to me:

Of course, of course. They are meeting their own

When they are meting an active development agent;

they tell me afterwards. They are telling "this,

But usually they are going to meet maids

or they don't have to report.

What about operational vehicles? Automobiles?

You see, we had one automobile for the whole

Approximately how much of your time did you spend

supervising GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV?.

I can't say.

Was it the most important function?

Yes, it was important.

All work in the First

Section was important. This was the nost impor-

tant.

But one day I could devote the whole day

to code clerks, the next day maybe half the day,

maybe

two hours in

the day.

The rest of the day

I will be absent.

I will be neeting with KLYPIN,

or I will be having a meeting with surveillance,

or I will be at anther place.

The third day,

again, maybe the whole day, maybe part of it.

No, I

can't tell you. It depends on the situa

tion.

Additional Duties in KOVSHUK's Absence

As Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, one of

NOSENKO's responsibilities was

to serve as Acting Chief

when KOVSHUK was absent from the office.

NOSENKO recalled

that be fulfillad this function during

Kov SHUK's two 30-day

leave periods in 1960 and 1961, but he did not remember

when this leave occurred in those years.

He also

served as

Acting Chief for about a month in the summer of 1960 when

KOVSHUK was in the KGB hospital with heart trouble and for a

week or

two some time in 1961 when KOVSHUK was 1l1 again.

NOSENKO was unable to recall any operational or inspection

trios that KOVSHUK made in 1960 or 1961, and the only other

specific time that he could remember KOVSHUK being absent

was for several days in connection with preparations for

President Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in

1960.

NOSENKO's description of his duties in KOVSHUK's ab-

sence was summarized in a protocol which he signed on 2; March

1965:

•I do not remember any particularly important

operational decisions I made as Acting Chief of Sec-

tion, nor any unusual things that happened during

Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations

(1) Introduction

Among the numerous KGB activities against American code

clerks in Moscow which SOSENko has discussed are five opera

tions wherein the KGB intended or effected approaches for

recruitment/defection purposes. According to NOSENKO, none

was successful.

The fiva major cases are reviewed separately

below, one of then in the context of duty trips abroad by

NOSENKO's subordinate KOSOLAPOV. **

NOSENKO said that, upon assuming responsibility for

supervising operations

against American code clerks,

"difficult situation."

Prior to the assignment

of KOSOLAPOY to the U.S. Embassy Section in late 1959, all

operations against code clorks had been handled by A.S. MALYU

GIN, but during SALYUGIX's two vears of effort. there had

beer no operational approaches and no successes. Then

*The Edmund STEVENS case is. discussed in Part V.C.2.

**GOLITSYN on 20 March 1962 identified KOSOLAPOV's photograph

as that of a veteran KCB officer with whon he was personally

acquainted.

GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had entered the KGB

is about 1952 and had served for two or three years as a

member of the First (American)

Department of the KGB First

Chief Directorate under United Nations cover in New York City;

subsequently he had worked for two or three years in the

First Chief Directorate at KGB Headquarters.

According to

GOLITSYN, the bachelor KOSOLAPOV was transferred to the KGB

Second Chief Directorate some time prior to 1960 in line with.

a KGB policy for only married men to be sent abroad.

As of

1960, GOLITSYN said, KOSOLAPOV was working against code clerks

stationed in the American Embassy in Moscow.

He added that

KOSOLAPOV speaks excellent English.

Prior

to GOLITSYN's

identification, CIA had

no indication of intelligence acti

vity on KOSOLAPOV's part:

Between February 1953 and April

1955 he was assigned to the United Nations Secretariat Trans-

lation Unit as a translator; in August 1958 he had been an

interpreter at the Geneva Conference on Nuclear Test Detection;

in September 1959 he accompanied KHRUSHCHEV on his trip to

the United States (see Part V.E.3.d. which desoribes the

role of NOSENKO's target. John ABIDIAN in connection with the

KHRUSHCHEV trip).

KOSOLAPOV's English is flawless.

On the several operations ageinst military code clerks

which NOSENKO has described and in which he has claimed a

personal role, his greatest detail and emphasis has been given

to the case of James Harry STORSBERG.

In 1952 NOSENKO said

that.

in line with CRIBANOVis instructions that he pay parti-

cular attention to code cleri operations,

he deroted most of

his tine

for

almost a year to che STORSBERG operstion, and

played a personal role in the unsuccessful KGE approach; he

described in

During tre 1964 to 1966 period, NUSENKO denied not orly that

he had personally participated in this way but also that he

had ever claimed to have done: he continued to say: however.

would then form the basis for the approach.

The operation dragged on through 1960 and

until the spring,

officer, was introduced in the guise of a wealthy frerch busi

(c) Information from PREISFREUND

CIA initially interviewed PREISFREUND on 8 July 1965 in

Helsinki.

(NOSENKO himself had suggested that PREISFLEUND

would confirm his story of the STORSBERG case.)

During this

first meeting with him, PREISFREUND coriectly identified photo-

graphs of KOVSHUK, NOSENKO, and STORSBERG.

He maintained, how

ever, that his relationship with KOVSHUK and NOSENKO was strictly

business level, that he had never had anything to do with

the KGB, and that he did not know what the initials "KGB" stand

Toward the end of this meeting, PREISFREUND allowed that

he may have been unwittingly involved in some activity

the "entire truth" the following day.

"either at the end of 1959 or early 1960."

Several weeks later, he said, he was approached by NOSENKO who

explaired that KOVSHUk was unavailable and that the iGs wanted

introduction between STORSBERG

and a Soviet female, Irina, the daughter of a Soviet general.*

PREISFREUND then left Moscow, and when he returned about two

months later, he took STORSBERG to the Peking Restaurant, where

the introduction was effected.

PREISFREUND, STORSBERG, Irina,

and arother girl then went to

PREISFREUND'S

hotei, where STORS-

BERG and Irina were intimate.

PREISFREUND said on 10 July 1965 that he was fairly certain

his recruitment took place in early 1960, probably in March

At the time KÖVSHUK had refused to explain what the KGB

wanted him to do; he said only that they would talk about it

later but assured PREISFREUND that he would not be asked to

undertake anything detrimental to Finnish

interests; nor did

KOVSHUK establish any means of communications with

PREISFREUND,

telling him only that the KGB would know where to find nim.

PREISFREUND subsequently visited the USSR on several occasions,

but no contacts were made.

Just as he was beginning to believe

that the affair had been forgotten, NOSENKO contacted him at

his room in the Berlin Hotel in Moscow.

Asked to explain his

earlier statement that NOSENKO first met with him two weeks

after the recruitment, PREISFREUND said he could not remember

exactly how long it was, but that it was definitely on another

trip to Moscow and that it was probably several months later.

PREISFREUND was asked how he had first met STORSBERG.

and recalled

that NOSENKO had simply told him to go there and "find Jim;"

the Finnish Embassy in Moscow through a mutual Finnish acquaint-

Throughout this initial period, NOSENKO and KOVSHUK made

repeated promises that once the introduction of STORSBERG to

the Soviet female had been accomplished, there would be no more

demands made of PREISFREUND by the KGB.

PREISFREUND added:

According to NOSENKO, this was Irina LEBEDOVSKAYA,

agent of the U.S. Embassy Section who was handled by A.v.

sation with GRYAZNOV down

"April or May 1960"

and quoted

GRYAZNOV as saying that the KGB

"is certain that the recuitment

GOLIPSYN also said that

the recruitment plan for this operation "evidently involved a

woman," but could provide no further details.

During these same

talks, according to GOLiTSYN, GRYAZNOV saId

that although the

KGB had earlier recruited U.S. Depurtment of State code clerks

in Moscow, this would be the first recruitment of a code clerk

in the office of the American Military Attache since the estab-

lishment of the Second Chief Directorate's American Department

(in the 1940's) .

GOLITSYN reported on the second operation on 26 February

1962, while discussing the *GB agent PREISFREUND. GOLIISYN

that he first met PREISFREUND when the latter went to the

Soviet Embassy in Helsinki in connection with an application

for travel to the USSR.

On several later occasions,

GOLITSYN

said, the two men had drinks together in Helsinki cafes.

According to GOLITSYN, PREISFREUND had been used in the recruit-

ment in Moscow of at least one American who "could have been a

code clerk or a diplomat."

He also knew that the recruitment

had been accomplished

"in 1960, at the end of 1960" and that

PREISFREUND, having met the target at America House in Moscow,

had helped to set up the target for the recruitment approach

by involving him in speculatory activities and by arranging his

introduction to various KGB female agents.

GOLITSYN thought

that PREISFREUND had dropped out of the case after "he had helped

to create the circumstances" and had not taken a direct part in

#*GOLITSYN's passport and travel records heid by CIA confirm that

COLITSYN travelled only twice to the Soviet Union after his

The first of these trips

was on 19 January 1961, when he flew directly from Helsinki to

Moscow; he returned to Helsinki by rail a week later, on 28

January. GOLITSYN's second trip to the Soviet Union was from

9 to 15

April 1961, when he appears to have spent all or most

of this period in Leningrad.

A Finnish national, whom GOLITSYN

had been developing in Helsinki, has reported that he met with

GOLITSYN in Leningrad

on a daily basis from 10 through 13 April

1961.

Moreover, GOLITSYN has never mentioned being in Moscow

during this time. ' Since GOLITSYN remained in Helsinki from

April until December 1961, when he defected, it appears that

he erred by one month in reporting the date of his conversa-

tons in the American Department and that he learned of the

second lead some

time during the week of 19 January 1961. This

is the same conversation of which NOSENKO spoke several times

in 1962 and subsequently (see above) • NOSENKO has always

maintained that he was out of Moscow on leave at the time of

GOLITSYN '& visit

and that this was in the summer of 1961. When

he was told in February. 1965 that GOLITSYN was in Moscow. in:

January 1961, NOSENKO replied that CIA was either wrong or

was attempting to deceive him.

NOSENKO declined to Change

his story os the summer leave.

(e) Information from other Sources

Information available to CIA indicates that the Attaches of:

the three U.s. military services represented in Moscow shared

a single cryptographic center as of 1960 and 1961 and that,

except for overlapping assignsents during periods of turnover,

there was normally only one military code clerk assigned to the

Embassy at any particalar time.

This military code clerk was

responsible for enciphering and deciphering the traffic of all

three military services.

In practice,

at least one other men

ber of the Attache staff in Moscow has held a cryptographic

clearance and has been trained and has performed the function

of back-up for the military code clerk during periods of the

latter's absence from the Moscow Embassy or inability

to per

form his functions for other reasons.

STORSBERG

was the only military code clerk assigned to the

Moscow Embassy from February 1960, when his predecessor, Everett

HOBSON, was reassigned, until Septenber 1961, when his successor,

Mathew

ZUJL'S, arrived.

STORSBERG himself arrived in Moscow in

January 1960 and departed in November 1961.

During the period of STORSBERG's tour in Moscow, back-up

cryptographic duties vere performed by the Military Communica-

tions Officer, CHO-2 HURLEY:

HURLEY performed these duties on

a number of occasions, including the night of the approach to

STORSBERG, and he could be loosely termed a code clerk.*

tionally,

he performed repair work on the cryptographic machines

and directed certain other sensitive activities at the Embassy.

HURLEY's tour in Moscow began shortly before STORSBERG'S, in

December 1959, and he served there until June or July 1962.

The only other person performing official functions in the

military code roon during.

the 1960-1961 period was James KEYSERS,

who arrived in Moscow on 22 December 1950 and was assigned to

the office of the Air Force Medical Officer.

As a concurrent

secondary assignment, KEYSERS worked as a clerk-typist in the

office of the Air Attache.

From February until mid-April 1961,

as a collateral duty, KEYSERS worked in the joint military code

he was in

training to serve as back-up cryptographer.

He was relieved of this duty in April 1961 for reasons of low

* Although NOSENKO has distinguished between STORSBERG's func-

tion as "military code clerk" and HURLEY's duties

as "mili-

tary code machine mechanic," he said on one occasion that

he considered both to be within the general category of

"military code clerks."

NOSENKO reported that there was no

KGB operation against HURLEY.

aptitude and lack of interest; in June 1961 he

was removed from

Moscow because of reported homosexual activities.*

NOSENKO has

described an operation againgt KEYSERS (see

selow), but because of the date of KEYSERS' arrival in Moscow

he must be ruled out as a candidate for the first of GOLIT-

SYN's two leads discussed above.

On the basis of available

information, it appears that the subject of this lead must

have been either STORSBERG Or HURLEY, the only two "military

code clerks" in Moscow in the spring of 1960.

The subject

Of COLIISYN's second lead could have been STOPSBERG, HURLEY.

or, in fact, anyone else at the Embassy, although GOLITSYN

suggested that he might be a code clerk and might be a mili-

tary man.

By his statement that there was no KGB operation

against HURLEY, together with his description of the opera-

tion against STORSBERG beginning in the spring of 1960 and

his (and PREISFREUND's) assertion that PREISFREUND took part

in only one operation for the KGB--that against STORSBERG--

NOSENKO has said in effect that both of GOLITSYN's leadg were

to

the STORSBERG operation, which ended in failure.

This con

flicts with GOLITSYN's report that PREISFREUND was involved

in a successful recruitrent operation in late 1960.

There are

also inconsistencies between the NOSENKO and GOLITSYN leads

as regards the progress of the operation.

GOLITSYN reported

that recruitment of a

code clerk was. "99 per cent" assured

in May-June 1960, whereas

NOSENKO and PREISFREUND describe

an operation which, at best, was just becoming active at that

time.

GOLITSYN, in reporting his second lead, said that the

operation in which PREISFREUND participated culminated "in

late 1960:" NOSENKO reported that the only operation in which

PREISFREUND took part ended in an unsuccessful approach to

STORSBERG in "mid-1961" oI, on other occasions, in "autunn

1961."

(111) TDY'S UY ROSOLAPOV on Code Clerk Cases

(a)

Introduction

Accordirg to NOSENKO, the U.S. Embass" Section officer

KOSOLAPOV travelled

only once to Helsinki, and KOSOLAPOV at.:

that time succeeded in his mission of accompanying-togetrer

with a KGB female agent--a suspected American code clerk, Paul

Francis JENNER, by train to Moscow.

(The KGB later learned

that JENNER was

not a code cleri but a pouch clerk who also met

couriers at the Moscow airport, HOSENKO said, and this KGB iden

tification of JENNER's specialty is confirmed by U.S. Department

of State files.) The report by NOSENKO on KOSOLAPOV is contra-

dicted by two sources, travel records available to CIA and the

KGB defector GOLETSYN.

Statements made by JENNER in 1960 and 1962 parallel those

Of NOSENKO in 1964 and 1965 to the

extent that two young Soviets,

a man and a woman, did converse with him on the train, and later

JENIER did encounter the same woman at a Moscow airport.

records contradict NOSENKO's statement that

ROSOLAPOV was the Soviet male aboard the train with JENNER on the

• 2i-hour journey.

Although NOSENKO insisted that KOSOLAPOV was on a single

to Finland,

in early 1960, travel records show that KOSOLA-

(under a different identity) went to delsinki in both the

spring and fall of 1960.

Travel records on the second Helsinki

TDY by KOSOLAPCV, on which NOSENKO has rot reported,

are borne

out by GOLITSYN.

GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV, in order to lay

the groundwork for a

future relationship in Moscow, accompanied

a U.S. Embassy

code clerk by train from Helsinki about November

1960, or perhaps as late as the beginning of 1961. Again on

the basis of travel records, it has been determined that on

16 November 1960 KOSOLAPOV was a fellow passenger of an Azerican

code clerk naned john W. GARLAND on the daily train from Hel-

sinki to Moscow.

The following discussion of the TDY'S of KOSOLAPOV ig

divided into three parts:

KOSOLAPOV's false identity for

travel, the early 1950 TDY, and the November 1960 TDY.

part incorporates the information from all sources, including

NOSENKO.

(b) Palse Identity for Travel

Vadim Viktorovich KOSOLAPOV was born in Perm' on 19 Febru-

ary.1928.

According to travel records, one Viktor Dmitrivevich

KOLOSOV, born in Perm'

on 19 March 1927, was in Finland fron

31 March to 2 April 1960, in Finland from 12 to 16 November 1960,

and in Denmark from 25 October to 1 November 1961.* In July 1965,

Johan PREISFREUND (see Part V.E.3.c.li. ;on STORSBERG operation)

identified for CIA a photograph of KOLOSOV as that of a KGB offi-

cer naned Vadim (last name unknown) who approached him in Moscow

NOSENKO reported that KOSOLAPOV travelled to Copenhagen in

1961 to recontact the YOUNGERs, an American man and wife who

vere arrested for espionage and recruited by the KGB while

touring the USSR in 1961 (see Part VI.D.2.)•

be a code cler%.

He wanted to send KOSOLAPOV tO Hel-

sinki with the

mission of returning with JeNnEr on

the sare train; during which tine XOSOLAPOV was to

study his behavior. JENNER was young and so was

KOSOLAPOV.

How old was JENNER at the time?

I don't know.

We sent GRYAZNOV's agent, a ballerina,

to Vyborg as

part of this operatic..

I.

think her

first name is Yeva, but I don't remember her last

name; her code name was "SOLISTKA"

She was placed

on the train in Vyborg as if she had been visiting

someone there

and was returning to Moscow.

The main

idea was

to place an agent near JENNER before he

even arrived in lascow.

We wrote a proposal to the

Chairnan

of the KGB giving the reasons for doing this.

We explained that we had usually only one year in

which to

work.

The agent "SOLISTKA"

met JENNER and

spoke with him.

KOSOLAPOV also became acquainted

with JENNER and spoke with him, but I can't say that

they were all speaking together at one time. She

gave JENNER a telephone number.

Question: A KGB telephone number?

NOSENKO:

Of course not; it was her own telephone number, but

he didn't call her.

We then noticed that he wasn't

working in the code room but in the mail room.

o.K.o

that was interesting too.

We waited one or two

months for the call to come, but nothing happened.

When JENNER once went to the railroad station or

airport alone to meet the couriers, we sent her with

GRYAZNOV by car in an attempt to have them meet

again.

JENNER saw her but did not approach (her).

Instead, he turned in the other direction. Only

later did we learn that he is a very quiet person.

There was nothing else on JENNER at all except a

suspicion

that he may have been a homosexual, but

there was no proof.

He was like a child.

Question:

How much time did you have between the time of the

anketa's arrival and the time of JENNER'S arrival?

NOSENKO: A month, plenty of time to prepare.

Question: A month?

NOSENKO: Well, approximately a month.

The usual approval

from

the Central Committee was necessary so that

KOSOLAPOV could go abroad.

Question:

NOSENKO:

Question:

Who wrote this?

I prepared the kharakteristika (official form) on

KOSOLAPOV for this TDY and gave it to the Personnel

office.

NOSENKO :

Question:

JOSENKO:

It was the idea of the group:

Did you advise KOSOLAPOV on what his role was to be

before he left-what he was to do?

I was discussing this case with GRYAZNOV and ROSO-

LAPOV, and maybe we discussed it with KOVSHUK on the

day: before KOSOLAPOV left.

Was "SOLISTKA" an experience agent?

She had been working before 1960, but I don't know

for how long.

Who handled her before GRYAZNOV?

Question:

HOSENKO:

I don't know.

guestion:

How did you coordinate this trip of KOSOLAPOV's with

other units,

for

example, with the (KGB] First Chief

Directorate

(FCD)?

HOSENKO:

KOSOLAPOV wrote a cable saying that he was coming

for two or three days.

question:

NOSENKO:

Did you approve this cable?

I didn't sign it, but I read it, and then we took it

to KLYPIN for his

signature.

Once it was signed,

KOSOLAPOV took it to the Second (European) Department,

FCD.

question:

What cover did ROSOLAPOV use for this trip?

NOSENKO:

What other cables or letters were sent to or re-

ceived from the Helsinki Rezidentura (Legal Resi

dency of the KGB]

Only

this cable, nothing else.

KOSOLAPOV was to dis-

cuss with the Rezidentura the possibility of obtaining

their help in Helsinki with the work against code

clerks, to see what agents they had, or. to study the

situation, the possibilities.

We wanted to use agents

He discussed this question with them and they said

they would see about it, but we were told that the.

Residency has more important guestiors.

What was more important than the work against code

clerks?

They didn't tell us.

Well, wasn't there some sign, some hint as to what

so important?

Code clerks

in Helsinki would be more important for

them; this is the work of the FCD.

How did KOSOLAPOV know how to find JENNER, to. recog

nize him and make contact?

KOSOLAPOV had his photograph, knew his name, and

for KOSOLAPOV.

We knew JENNER must cross on the

15th.

Question:

When did KOSOLAPOV leave for his trip to Helsinki?

NOSENKO:

I don't know.

Question:

When did he return?

NOSENKO:

I don't know, don't remember.

Question: How long was KOSOLAPOV gone in all?

NOSENKO:

About one week, not more than one week counting

travel time.

Question: How did KOSOLAPOV travel to Helsinki?

NOSENKO: By train, both ways.

Question:

was he alone on the way down or did someone go with

him?

NOSENKO: He was alone.

Question:

How did you arrange for "SOLISTKA" to board the

right train?

NOSENKO:

GRYAZNOV sent "SOLISTKA" alone to. Vyborg and had the

local KGB officers there meet her and place her on

the correct train.

They knew the date and would

establish the fact that KOSOLAPOV was on that train

before placing her aboard...

Also on 15 February 1965 NOSENKO made the following addi

zional statement not included in the protocol:

"The agent was

"SOLISTRA.'

She was GRYAZNOV'& agent even before 1960•

NOV briefed her for the mission...

in it. "SOLISTKA' also

gave a report to GRYAZNCV, but there was nothing there, either."

NOSENKO was questioned on 20 October 1966 about his respon

sibility for and knowledgeability of KGB operations against

American code clerks.

He was required to give only brief answers,

without discussion, to specific questions. The CIA questions

and his answeis were as follows:

The remaining information on KOSOLAPOV's TDY in early 1960

comes from other sources:

- After arriving in Moscow on 1 April 1960, JENNER

reported that he was approached on the train from Helsinki

by two young

Russians,

"a boy and a girl, probably uni-

versity stusents."*

Russians struck

up a corver-

sation and were

soon baiting him on

the question of racial

discrimination in the United States.

They said that they

three months later, on

29 June, JENNER was performing his normai duty of escort-

ing Enibassy

couriers to Sheremetevo Airport when he was

again approached by the

russian girl, Yull, who acted

to see hin and asked him to go outside to

Yuli explainea that she was waiting to say goodbye to

friend who was

leaving on a

flight to Irkutsk (JENNER had

seen the Irkutsk flight depart

a half hour earlier) and

told JENNER that her male companion on the train trip to

Moscow, Yura,

had returned to his studies in Vyborg.

Interspersed

Yuli's questions concerning JENNER's

impressions and

personal activities in Moscow were others

abour how often he came to the airport and how he liked

his job at the Embassy.

When JENNER said he must leave.

she gave him her telephone rumber in Moscow and insisted

that he call her.** She advised JENNER that "it would be

better if you did not mention our conversation to anyone."

- Besides information about his Soviet companions on

the Moscow Journey.

JENNER also toid U.S. Department of

State security officials about sexual advances made by

his first maid in Moscow and about provocative clothing

worn by his second maid.

(NOSENKO has not indicated that

either of these two women was & KGB agent, but has said

in another context that all

maids of American code clerks

were KGB agents or informants.)

- CIA investigations showed that I. Ye. SERGEYEV,

KGB officer and

the Soviet Consul in Helsinki, contacted

the police chief there on 31 March 1960 to ask his assist-

ance in locating

an American named Paul F. JENNER who was

due to arrive in Helsinki the day before.***

Apart from denying that it ever too: place, NOSENKO has said

about a trip

to Helsinki by KOSOLAPOV in lovember 1960,

but GLITSYN saiù

such a trip occurred and related it to an in-

cipient KGB operation against an American sode clerk.

GOLITSYN was not posted to the KGB Legal Residency in liel-

ginii until July 1960, i.e., after XOSOLAPOV's first trip to

the KOLOSOV alias.

He has reported that at

"about the end of

1960, about November or possibly by the begin-

ning of 1961, " the KGB

Chief Directorate sent a teleg:an

to the Helsinki Legal Residency.

The telegram advised that ar

American code clerk would

arrive in Helsinki in trisit to

Moscow; the responsible case officer wouls be KOSOLAPOV, WiD

was being sent to lelsinki under an alias and under Yreshtora

to strike up an acquaintance to be con-

tinued with the American in Moscow.

The following extracts are from the transcript of GOLITSYN's

further remarks on this subject in early 1962:

Question:

You say that around rovember 1960 KOSOLAPOV came

to Finland?

GOLITSYN: Came to Finland.

Question: He came under cover?

GOLITSYN: Yes.

Question:

GOLITSYN:

Under a new identity? With an alias?

Yes, as an employee of Trade Union (Vneshtorg) .

But, of course, there may be some different dates.

Maybe November.

In the context of discussion of KOLOSOV/KOSOLAPOV's travels

1966 that CIA was aware of a second trip chere which NOSENKO had

not reported.

(iv) KGS-Polish IB Activities Against MORONE

(a)

Introduction

In 1961 CIA learned from a Polish source who furnished

much

reliable and sensitive information that, with the assist

ance of its Polish counterpart, the Office of Security (UB),

the KGB in November 1960 began

using a female agent against

Joseph MORONE, a U.S. Department of State code clerk assigned

to the American Embassy in Moscow in August 1960.

The woman

accompanied MORONE on a train trip from loscow, became inti-

mate with him in Warsaw, returned to Moscow twice in February

1961, and there

The compromising

scenes of MORONE and the Polish UB agent were

photographed.

This information on the KGB operation

was received by CIA soon

after the wonan's second visit to Moscow.

on the basis of this

report, NORONE was interviewed and polygraphed in Oslo in May

1961, ard he was transferred to Lisbon from Moscow in August

1961.

NOSENKO gave a few details on the

same case, without men

tioning the name of the KGB target, during the

1962 meetings in

Geneva.

In 1964 and 1965 he furnished more particulars on

the

MORONE case, identifying three KGS agents (besides the Polish

female) who participated in the operation. NOSENKO, however,

said that two of them added no information of use to the KGB

against MORONE, and that he was unable to remember what the third

agent reported: statements by other sources indicate thai re-

garding MORONE

all three agents could have acquired information

of operational potential

for the KGy.

NOSENKO has not reported.

as have other sources,

that. a fourth

KGB agent ramed Ella UMANETS

was in contact with MORONE, or that the KGB officer SIVORTSOV

posing as MICHAUD--was with MORONE at America House on at least

one occasion, the night when STORSBERG says he was

approached

by the KGB (see above) • NOSENKO has confused the MORONE case

with another by saying

that a fifth KGB agent was directed

against MORONE, whereas she was apparently directed against the

American code clerk ZUJUS (see below).

The sensitive source of

the original report on MORCNE stated

that a KGB officer "VOLODYA"

-(Vladimir,

last name unknown) personally met the Polish female

agent when she arrived in Moscow, and NOSENKO said that the

officer was his subordinate KOSOLAPOV.

claimed a KGB photographic technician supporting the case re-

ported to him, but he retracted this remark after CIA showed

him that travel records on NOSENKO made it impossible for the

technician to have spoken to him as he described.

According to

NOSENKO, MORONE was reassigned from Moscow before the KGB could.

take further steps against the code clerk, and he speculates

MORONE's transfer was prompted by American authorities'

over his relationship with one of the KGB female agents.

(b)

NOSENKO's Information

At his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962 NOSENKO made

a passing reference to an operation in which he had placed a

female agent of the Polish

service in contact with an Anerican

from the Moscow Embassy while the latter was visiting Warsaw.

Later, NOSENKO said, he brought the same female to Moscow in -

order

to obtain further compromising materials on this Anerican.

## Page 115

202.

Asked on Il June 1962 whether he had had foreign agents

working against the

U.S. Embassy, NOSENKO described his having

introduced the idea of using such agents to develop Americans

afraid of contacts with

Russian girls. He said that he himself

had several of these third-national agents, that he sometimes

would ask the German and Polish services to supply him with

agents,

and that it was unnecessary for him to explain their

intended use in operations against Americans.

NOSENKO then

gave an example:

"Listen,

the sergeants (enlisted men]

America,

so where did they go to rest lon leavel?

To Finland

or Poland.

Why Poland?

Because they

What do we do?

We planted

We arranged a chance meeting,

They were on leave for a week and a half.

they

would be going.

I made an intediate phone call to

warsaw.

'Give

me

'Get a acod whore for me

there, a pretty one but not one who strikes the eye particu

larly.'

Well,

they sent me such a girl.

And I placed this

Polish agent on the same train,

in the

sare cär, even in the

same compartment.

The train left.

One of the Anericans,

the

one in whom ve were particularly interested, the code clerk,

wanted the girl and

there, in the compartment,

they went to bed

together wit.

le the other

American slept.

I toid the Poles in

Narsaw to give the girl an apartment and to get photographs.

They arrangod ar apartment and he came there.

Everything was

0.k.

After

a week

and a half he retirred to rescow.

We did

not rush things.

A month

passed.

Two months.

Let's not rush,

I said.

A half a year

went by.

I insisted the: nothing further

may be done any earlier.

Then

said,

'All right,

let's give

him this girl, this Pole.' She arrived (in Moscow)

and they net

one another.

NOSENKO

stated on 1 February 1964: "I remember we were

working on one of the members of the guard of the American Em-

bassy, who was going to warsaw for a good time,

for a few days'

relaxation.*

We wrote to our

advisors [KGB officers attached

to the Polish UB) to do éverything possible--to get a pretty

Polish girl for the fellow and to photogragh any intimate

scEnes.

The Poles introduced the guard to the girl, they did

have intimate relations, but they gave us photographs without

any intimate scenes.

Just how they are sitting together, how

he is kissing her--that's all. Nell, we got these photographs

and some time went by and then we asked that the Poles send

us this Polish girl so that she could meet him iri Moscow. They

The guard referred to is Frank BEGGS, a marine enlisted man

The facts, however, seem

to relate to MORONE, who has described his encounter with

the Polish girl and her subsequent recontact in Moscow.

BEGGS has also reported (see below) that MORONE met a Polish

girl on the train to Warsaw and that she later contacted him

in Moscow: BEGGS has denied that he himself was contacted

by any such girl in the Soviet Union after the trip to warsaw

with MORONE.

1961, but the circumstances described by NOSENKO seem to

apply to those surrounding a relationship between a woman

named Lillian (last name not known) and the military code

clerk zuJUS.

These details are given in Past V.=.3.c.(v).

In ankevent, the incident involving Lilliar occurred after

Although the KG3 had the compromising photography, it was

felt that there were

insufficient materials for a recruitment

approach to MOPONS.

The KGB warted to trap him in the apart

ment of a Soviet

roman, to

catch him in something that is defi

nitely prohibited.

For this purpose, Svetlana IVILOVA

(see

abovel was' supcosed to lure NORCNE into the city, but before

anything further could be done, the Americans ordered MORONE

out of Moscow before the end of his tour, possibly because they

were

concerned about his association with IVANOVA. Therefore,

NOSENKO said, the KGB made

no operational approach

to MORONE

and no recruitrent of him.

She stayed at the hotel Warsaw

in Moscow.

The KGB case officer, apparently from the American

Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorute, on 10 November

1969 pointed MORONE out to this agent at a railroad station in

MOSCOt.

Under KGB instructions,

the Folish female met MORONE

In Warsaw on

12 November

1960 she was quite friendly with Noron, but pur-

suant to instructions.

she refused all overtures to engage in

intimacies.

The next

day she took MORONE to a Polish UB safe-

house suitably prepared

for clandestine photography, and reveal-

ing photographs of an

intimate nature were taken of

MORONE

and herself.

The fenale agent again travelled to Moscow on

5 February 1961 and stayed

at the Peking Hotel. Further com

promising photographs were taken of her and MOPONE on this

trip.

The female agent travelled to Moscow a third time and

on 12 and 13 February 1961 more photographs were taken of her

and MORONE.

While reviewing a list of personnel assignes to the

American Enbassy in

Moscow in 1963, NOSENiO said on 28

January 1964:

"Matthen ZUJUS=-how come?

That man can't

That's the homosexual code clerk I told

you about, (thel homosexual who was urgently sens oack o

It is

impossible"

He was asked whether he was sure of his

facts, and NOSENKO answered:

"yes.

this must be the

same man, but this must be an error in your document.

He just cannot be in Moscon."

NOSENKO telephoned the Geneva safehouse on 2 February

1964 and said that he wanted to come right over as he had

something inportant to say.

The neeting with CIA opened

as follows:

"I was thinking last nigh: and I realized

It was not ZUJUS, but it was KEYSERS.

In other words, everything I said about ZUJUS applies to

KEYSERS,"

"I don't remember having any face-to-face encounters

(with Americans)

except when KEYSERS was

leaving," NOSENKO

stated on 17 April 1964, "When he was being taken to the

airport we decided, "Why not try, in case he's alone; why

not approach him and ask hin if he wants to stay?"

And sure

enough he stood there with these two officers and then he

walked into the restaurant alone...

d. NOSENKO's Reeponsibility Eor Coverage of ABIDIN

(1) Introduction

John V. ABIDIAN served as the U.S. Embassy Security Officer

in Moscow from 2 March 1960 until February 19€2, approximately

the same period as NOSENKU's claimed service in the U.S. Erbassy

Section of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate.

During his Moscow tour. ABIDIAN was coopted by CIA to perform a

number of operational tasks, including clandestine letter reilings

to several CIA agents inside the Soviet Urion and servicing a

dead drop to be used only for receiving two special types of

communicationg* from the source in the GRU, Colonel O.V. PENKOV-

SKIY.

During his 1962 meetings. with CIA, NOSENKO mentioned ABIDIAN

on several occasions,

identifying him as the Embassy Security

Officer and as & CIA

officer.

In 1962 he described ABIDIAN'S

letter. mat-ling activittes, and he said he was himsel? concerned

(zanimat ' sya) with ABIDIAN.

After resontacting CiA in Geneva in

January 1964 NOSENKO divulged that he had been the KGS

ca39

officer responsible for coverage of AbIDIA: in Moscow: for the

first time he described then a visit made by ABIDIl to the

PENKOVSKIY dead drop site.

The discussion below ia divided into three parks:

NOSENKO ' &

case officer responsibilities and the information he learned

about ABIDIAN, NOSENKO's knowledge of clandestine letter mailings

by ABIDIAN,

and NOSENKO's statenents on ABIDIAN and the Pushkin

Street dead drop.

(11) Duties as Case Officer

On 17 April 1964 when asked to describe his transfer from

the Jourist Department to the American Department in January

1960, NOSENKO said that when he reported for duty and was inter-

viewed by V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the American Department, and

V.M. KOVSHUK, Chief of

the U.S. Embassy Section, he was told

that

as one

of his duties he would be the case officer in charge

of ABIDIAN,

whose arrival in Moscow was expected in the near

future.

NOSENKO was the only XGB officer responsible for cover-

age of and activities against ABIDIAN and, NOSERKO said, ABIDIAN

was the only American target for whom he, personally, was offl

cially accountable while in the U.S. Embassy Section.

NOSENKO was questioned in detail concerning ABIDIAN for

six days in January and February 1965.

He produced the infor-

mation in the following paragraphs at that time.

When NOSENKO began to work in the U.S. Embassy Section.

ABIDIAN had not yet arrived in Moscow.

The section, however.

already had received some information

on him, and this was given

to NOSENKO by KOVSHUK. Among this material was ABIDIAN'S V180

one type was early-warning information, the other notifi-

cation of his forthcoming absence from Moscow.

as of this time, PENKOVSKIY submitted information in

Moscow via contacts with the British Embassy and the

British businessman Greville WINE.

application, the negative results of checks of KGB Headquarters

files, and a report prepared by the American. Department of the

First Chief Directorate®

ascording to this report.

based on

correspondence from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United

States, ABIDIAN had served as a Departmen: of State Security

Officer concerred with the personal safety of Premier KHRUSHCHHEV

when he visited the United States in 1959:

from the way ABIDIA

had acted at that time, the Legal Residencies concluded he was an

intelligence officer, probably with CIA."

NOSENKO remarked that

the report, combined with the fact that ABIDIAN was replacing the

known CIA officer Russell LAVCELLE as Security Officer, made

ABIDIAN one uf the most important counterirtelligence targets

of the U.S. Embassy Section and therefore of the entire Second

Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO personally opened the KGB file on ABIDIAN and later

assigned him the cryptonym

"ARSEN,

since this cryptonym had been

used by personnel of the Sevench (Surveillance) Directorate,

KGB Second Chief Directorate, Who were working against him,

NOSENKO was unsuccessful in his attempts to learn more about

the life and career of

ABIDIAN.

He visited the Chief of the

American Department of the KCB First Chiet Directorate, but this

unit had no information in acdition to that already included in

the original information report.

NOSENKO requested that the KGB

Legal Residencies in the United

States be asked for further de-

tails, but they were never received.

For these reasons, NOSENKO

said that he did not know and never

obtained details about ABID-

IAN's education and study abroad. date of entry into the Depart-

ment of State, promotions, personal rank. previous foreign assign-

ments, military service

or status as Foreign Service Reserve,

Staff

or Officer (FSR, FSS, FSO%,**

* CIA records indicate that ABIDIAN studied in Paris in 1949-50

and then secured empioymeat with the Department of State as

a clerk/typist.

He remained in Paris Until 1954, After spe-

cial training at the CIC school at Fort Holabird and the

Secret Service School, ABIDIAN served from 1956 until leaving

for Moscow in 1960 as

a special

agent in the State Depart-

ment's Office of Security.

A iarge part of his work in this

period was arranging the security of and accompanying foreign

dignitaries visiting the United States.

These included the

visits of Soviet Foreign Minister SHEPILOV in November 1956,

MIKOYAN in the spring of 1959, and KHRUSHCHEV at the end of

1959.

These duties undoubtedly brought ABIDIAN into contact

with a large number of KGB officers stationed in New York and

Washington.

One of the members of the KHRUSHCHEV entourage

was KOSOLAPOV who,

according to NOSENKO, joined the U.S.

Embassy Section in late 1959

and, as of January 1960, became

NOSENKO's subordinate in operations against American code

clerks.:

#*NOSENKO was. unaware of the meaning of the initials FSR, FSS,

and FSO. When asked whether he had checked the Department

¡of: State Biographic Register: for information on ABIDIAN'S:

background, he replied that this publication is not available

in the U.S., Embassy Section. • He subsequently recalled that

the Chief of the Section; KOVSHUK, did have a copy dated:

about 1956, which was of no use in gathering information on

ABIDIAN •

Because: ABIDIAN was considered to be a CIA officer. he was

made

a. "special target" of surveillarce from the date of his

arrival..

He was always under 24-hour surveiliance by it lcast

two

and often three KGB teams.

so that at any hour a team was

available to cover him if he left the U.S. Embassy.

The only

time this intensity of covirage might have beer reduced, NOSENKO

said, was during a period of about one and one-hale monehs in

1961, wren surveillance of the Embassy was generally reduced in

order to allow increased coverage of British targets.*

Ag the

responsibie case officer, HUSENKO direcord the surveillance of

ABIDIAN ard evaluated the operationai

possibilities offered by

pertirent information

in the surveillar.co reports.

Prior to ARIDIAN's arrival in Moscow, the decision was reach-

ed not to work aggressively against him with agent contacts or

provocateurs unless he first demonstrated sons personal vulner-

NCSENKO stated.

It was considered botter

on surveillance coverage ir. the hope that, as LANGELLE's succes-

sor, he might lead "to anther PoPoV. " Therefore; no operational

plan was written on ABIDIAN until about Uctober 1960.

This plan,

which NOSENKO wrote, called for nu direct action but did specify

- ABIDIAN's maid, Tatyana FELOROVIl, an operational

contact of the U.S.

Embassy Section, was to continue to

apply metka to ABIDIAl's clothing and NEETUNE-80 to his

shoes. ***

(She put metka on AbIDlaw's clothing approxi

mately every 14 to 21 days throughout the tire she

employed by AFIDIAN.)

The only item of operation.l in-

terest from her during this period was evidence that

failed to recognize it; when told her name, however. he again

said she was GAVRILEYKO's agent and that she was valuable be

cause she had a good education and was able to provide per-

sonality sketches or her students. He did not associate her

with ABIDIAN until he was told by his interrogators in

Febru

ary 1965 that ABIDIAN had been one of her students.

NOSENKO

then made the above statement concerning these lessons. ABIDiAN.

reported that he took regular language lessons from GROMOKOVA,

normally three one-half hour lessons a week. beginning shortly.

after his arrival in Moscow and continuing until his departure.

The first few lessons were with a group of other Embassy per-

* sonnel,

and then ABIDIAV switched to private lessons for the

remainder of his tour in the Soviet Union;

In reporting his

contacts with GROMOKOVA,. ABIDIAN said he refused to be drawn

into talking about his Embassy responsibilities during Russian

language conversation but kept the topic limited to his past:

personal life, travel, education, his fiancee, ard his trips

on which he saw his fiancee.

ABIDIAN also reported that on

23 June 1960 CROMOKOVA attempted to persuade him to pass a

letter to departing personnel officer Mery GORINHA for for-

warding to Jean LIEBERMAN,

a former. student.

When ABIDIAN

refused, saying

that this de against

Soviet

law, GROMOROVA

When informed that ABIDIAi gave "KAiD" his

relephone rumker. NOSENKO recommended that 'KiMo" try to develop

a relationship with ABiDIAN.

After arguing that this was against

tha policy of taking no aggressive or provocative actior. against

ABIDIA', KOVSHUK and KLYPIN finally agreed, and "KAMO" phored

ABIDIt twice on KGB instructions.

ABIDIAN, however, refused

NOSENKO did not know the room number of ABIDIAN's office in

the Embassy or on what floor it was located, but said that he

could check the room number if necessary since he had à copy of

the Embassy telephore list putlished

monthly with the office room

ABIDIAN'S

"Zone of Security" (a.e.,

secure office areas).

important information about AbIDIAN from other

microphones in the Embassy.**

NOSENKO did

not know the location of ABIDIAi's apartment in

the Embassy building. for how it was furnished,

He said that

he did not consider data of this nature to be operationally

significant unless the target had shown vulnerabilities or was

under active development,

Aware that ABIDIAN travelled from the USSR two or three times

stationed in Moscow, NOSEXO did not know to which countries

of year when the trips were madem such

ABIDIN'S case officer since, like LINGELLE 5 earlier trips

abroad, ABIDIAN's trips were presumed

to be for operational pur-

There was, however, no possibility for the KGB to finc

out where ABIDIAN had gone;****

even if the U,S, Embassy Section

did establish where ABIDIAN would travel, nothing could be done

See below for ABIDIAN's account of a similar incident involv-

ing a Soviet he met while on a trip to Armenia.

** In 1960-61 the Security Officer occupied a

room where an in-

operative microphone was discovered in 1964.

**#ABIDIAN made at least three trips abroad during his two years

in Moscow.

August 1960 he took personal leave to visit

his fiancee, a French girl, in the south of france and met

with a CIA officer while there.

In February 1961 he flew on

the Ambassador's plane to Paris for meetings with CIA and

then took personal leave to visit his fiancee.

In Septenber

1961, at CIA request, ABIDIAN again flew to France and to

New York City and washington for briefings connected with

the handling of PElKOVSKIY in Moscow.

sodthen CIA interrogators suggested that the KGB could have

photographed ABIDIAN's passport on his return to Moscow,

NOSENKO replied that the Second Chief Directorate does not

photograph passports of foreign diplomats entering the Soviet

about it because the foreign Legal Residencies of the KGB First

Chief Directorate would not accept a request for operational

action against an inerican diplomat coming fron Moscow.

In February 1965 NOSENKO was asked a nunker of times

whether he knew of ary occasions on which heiDIAl took trips in

the soviet Urion outside of Moscow.

He replied each time that he

knew of no such trips and that 1f

ABIDIAN had made such a trip or

trips he would have known of them and would remember them as it

would have been his responsibility as case officer to take cer-

tain actions.

Ationg the

latter he listed:

- Receivirg notification of ABIDIAl's request to travel

from the UPDi (the Soviet Government organization which pro-

vides services to tre alplomatic sormunity in Moscow).

- Notifying the UPDK Of KGB approval for the trip.

- Notizzing appropriate local KGB offices on ABIDIAN'S

itinerary and giving them instructions for surveillance and

other operational activity if desired.

- Recelving. reading, and filing all surveillance

reports

and reports of other operational activity carried

out by locak Gb units.

NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps. He stated

further that even if he were absent when such a request for travel

was made, he would have seen all documents upor. his return and

that he did not remember seeing

such cocuments in ABIDIAN's file.

NOSEVO's interrogators then told NOSENKO that ABIDIAN

travelled out of Moscow from

5 to 9 October 1950.*

Thereupon

NOSENKO stated that he specifically recalled having been on leave

in October 1950.

He said that he could not recall exactly the

dates of this leave (which he had rot mentioned before, but he

did remember that he was away exactly 30 days since he stayed at

a dacha near Moscow and therefore was not allowed any travel

NOSENKO said further that he also remenbered that he had

ABIDIAN made a trip with Paul A. SMITH, the Embassy's Publi-

cations Procurement Officer, to Armenia between 5 and 9 Octo-

ber 1960.

(ABIDIAN is of Armeniar. origin, and speaks the

Armenian

language with a high degree of proficiency.) while

there ABIDIAN visited with various churchren and their

parishioners ard an Armenian who had repatriated from Greece

in 1946.

They attended a service in Echmiadzin celebrating

the anniversary of the accession of the Katolikos VAZGEN I,

and ABIDIAN also visited some relatives of his in or near

the city of Yerevan. After returning to Moscow, an Armenian

whom ABIDIAN had met on this trip tried to contact ABIDIAN

at the Embassy: but ABIDIAN refused to see him.

When NOS-

ENKO was told

that on 7 October 1960 ABIDIAN attended a ser-

vice celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Armentan Kato-

likos, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO recalled that ABIDIAN. had gone to

Echmiadzin and

that an agent had reported a contact with him

there.

This agent, NUSENKO recalled, was a priest or a monk.

and the report concerned only his conversation with ABIDIAN®

the agent had no further contact with. him.

NOSENKO said

that this was his sole recollection concerning. ABIDIAN's

trip. and that he remembered no other details.

is possible that she was not employed by ABIDiAl at the time

that no one but FEDOROVICH had the possibility of doing

suggested that FEDOROVICH may have occasionally cleaned

ABIDIAN'S apartment on an informal basis before being

formerly hired as his maid. NOSENKO seid that this was

possibly the case.

so or not, but ABIDIAN gave his interviewer the impression

ABIDIAN'S Servicing of the Pushkin Street Dead Dop

In 1964 NOSENKO told CIA for the firse time that KGB sur-

veillance had observed a visit by BIDIN to a probable dead

drop on Pushkin Street in Moscor a the erd $ 1960. This dead

drop figured prominently in the PErKOVSKIY case.

NOSENKO's first remarks on this subjece were made on 20 April

"I left Lthe U.S. Embassy Section' in 1962.

There was an

interesting move.

This address where JACOES" was caught in the

PENKOVSKIY case - the same address was visited by ABIDIAN in

1960, or at the beginning of 1981.

On the basis of information supplied by NOSENKO during

April 1964, he was questioned during January and February 1965

consistent with and somewhat more cetailed than earlier state-

ments not recorded here, is taken from these 1965 interroga-

tions:

• In 1951, while NOSENKO das the responsible case

tricer, the KGB followed ABIDIAN from

to a residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow.

A stationary

surveillance post at the Embassy saw ABIDIAN

leave with the Publications Procurement Officer of the

Embassy in a chauffeured autonobile, rather than in the

car he normally used.

The surveillance team assigned

speciflcally to ABIDIAN

thereupon followed the car to

a bookstore. Both Americans ertered the bookstore, but

shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone,

He walked arourd

the corner and

entered a residential building next to a

meat market on Pushkin Street.

ABIDIAN emerged after a

few seconds.

The surveillarce team saw him go in but did

not follow him.

This unusual incident was reported by

the surveillance team to the KGB Seventh (Surveillance)

Directorate, and the building was inspected that same day

by the Chief of the First Department of the Surveillance

Directorate, KOZLOV, together with the Deputy Chief of the

American Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

MATVEYEV.

Taking into account the character of the building

and its

inhabitants, the duration and circumstances of

ABIDIAN ' S

visit.

and the suitability of the hallway -

particularly the

radiator in it - for. use as a dead drop

site, it was decided by the leadership of the Second Chief

Directorate and the Surveillance Directorate that a station-

ary surveillance post should immediately be set up to cover

this location.

• Because of the short time avallable, it was

not possible to place this post inside the building, so it

was set up across the street.

In addition, the radiator

was checked daily to see if anything.

such as a macnetic

container, had been concealed behind it.

This stationary

post was maintained

around the clock for 30 days,

after

which it was maintained from 0800 until midnight

for another

tWO

months.

If a package or magnetic container had been

found behind the radiator, which was checked

every morning,

it was planned to attach to it very thin wires to trigger

a signal should someone remove the package.

At the sane

time a member of the surveillance team would be stationed

on the landing of the staircase in this building, out of:

sight from the

hallway below.

During the three months

that the post was maintained, nothing was found

concealed

behind the radiator, nor were any suspicious persong seen

entering or leaving

the building.

The post was then dis

continued, but the address was placed on a list of sus-

picious places inspected daily by the Surveillance Direc-

torate.

The true significance of this location became

known to the KGB only later, after the arrest of PENKOV-

SKIY in 1962.

~ NOSENKO first heard of ABIDIAN's visit to the sus-

pected dead drop

the day it occurred.. He was

sitting in KOVSHUK's office when he received a telephone

call from MATVEYEV telling him of the incident. Although

NOSENKO was ABIDIAN's case officer and KOVSHUK was Chief

of the U.S. Embassy Section, the decision to place the

stationary surveillance post on this location was made at

a higher

level; neither of them was involved in it or in

the later decision to discontinue the post.

NOSENKO him

self visited the building on Pushkin Street the following

day or the day after, but he remained only a few minutes

and did not recall any details of the hallway, except that

there was a radiator there.

- As ABIDIAN's case officer, NOSENKO recalled re-

ceiving the surveillance report of his visit to the

Pushkin Street building and placing this report in

ABIDIAN 's file.

(This is the case file which NOSENKO

turned over to his successor, CRYAZNOV, about 28-28 December

1961, just before he transferred to the Tourist Department.)

- NOSENKO received no written reports on the results

of the stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss

this matter with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during

the first month of surveillance, periodically after that.

These discussions took place either by telephone.

KOZLOV was visiting NOSENKO's office, or when NOSENKO

visited KOZLOV's office in KGB Headquarters.

or perhaps someone else, NOSENKO learned that the post had

been discontinued after

Un the basis of these

conversations with KOZLOV, NUSENKO knew that nothing of

interest occurred during the period of the stationary sur

veillance.

- NOSENKO was in the U.S. Embassy Section during all

the period that the stationary-surveillance post was watch

ing the Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard

from kozlot that the post had been replaced by periodic

inspections.

- NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance

on the Pushkin Street dead

drop site to his CIA contacts

in Geneva in June 1962 because the post had already been

discontinued by this time without anything unusual or sus

picious having been noted.

Therefore he thought that this

incident would not be particu arly interesting to the CIA.

CIA records show that ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street

dead drop site only once,

on 30 December 1961, a year later

NOSENKO says, in response to an apparent signal from PENKOVSKIY.

The sequence

of events was as follows:

On 27 December 1961,

following reccipt of what seemed to be the prearranged signal

from PENKOVSKIY that the drop had been loaded, Air Force Captain

Alexis DAVISON drove from his apartment to the U.S. Embassy to

alert ABIDIAN. At about 2100 hours the same night. ABIDIAN

left in his own car for Spasso House, the Ambassador's residence

where a dance was in progress, to tell the CIA Chief of Station,

Paul GARBLER, about the signal. ABIDIAN and GARBLER left Spasso

House with the other guests at about 0200 on 28 December in

ABIDIAN's car and drove past the telephone pole where, as part

of his "drop loaded" signal, PENKOVSKIY was to leave a mark.

Later in the morning of 28 December. ABIDIAN, again in his own

car drove from the Embassy to hiIDSON's apartment, where he

first checked the telephone pole visually from the window and

then walked by it for a closer examination.

Although it was

not certain that the telephone calls received on 27 December

had, in fact, been a signal from PENKOVSKIY and although no

supplementary mark was found on the telephone pole, a decision

was reached to check the drop.

Therefore, at 1115

on 30 Decem-

ber 1961, ABIDIAN with Julian F. MacDONALD, an Embassy Economics

Officer, left the Embassy in an official car with a Soviet

driver and proceeded to a bookstore on the corner of Pushkin

Street.

At 1130 ABIDIAN entered the building where the drop

site was located, determined that the drop was empty, and

left one minute later..

The pair then returned to the Embassy.

These facts were outlined tp NOSENKO during the February

1965 interrogations.

It was poipted out that. by his on most

recent account; NOSENKO had transferred from the U.S. Embassy

Section to the Tourist Department about 28 Decenber 1961 and

that his participation in a Tourist Department approach to

American citizen W. E

JOHNSON on 5 January 1962 had been con

firmed by JOHNSON himself:

Therefore. NOSEiKO was told, much

of what he had told CIA about his own role in the Pushkin

Street affair became untenable.

NOSENKO's rEsponse to this

observation is described

in Part V.F. 3., which discusses

NOSENKO's approach to JOHNSON.

Also during the February 1965 interrogations NOSENKO refused

to sign the page

of a protocol which read as follows:

"I have been told by my interrogators that ABIDIAN'g

only visit to the Pushkin

§treet site took place on 30 DEC-

ember 1961.

Therefore, I was told that:

I could not have placed the surveillance

report in ABIDIAN's case file because I had already

turned over the file to GRYAZiOV.

b. I could not have received reports about the

expire until 30 March 1962 - more then two

weeks after I left for feneva.

Thus I could not have known in June 1962 that the surveil

lance of the dead drop site had failed to produce results

or that it had been discontinued."

Although he acknowledged having reported to CIA on his involve

ment with ABIDIAN as summarized in the protocol, NOSENKO said

the way in which the protocol was prepared made him "look silly."

On no other occasion has NOSENKO refused to sign protocols

dealing with other subjects.

NOSENKO was questioned further during October 1966 concern-

ing ABIDIAN's visit to-Pushkin Street. NOSENKO -eaffirmed that

ABIDIAN was under special surveillance coverage throughout his

Moscow tour and that this surveillance detected his travel from

the U.S. Embassy to Pushkin Street and back; he would date this

only as

"sometime in 1961." NOSENKO was asked whether KGB sur-

veillance had detected any unugual movements by ABIDIAN during

the period just preceding his visit to the PENKOVSKIY drop

site (a reference

to his movements on 27 and 28 December 1961

as described above). He replied that he knew definitely that

surveillance had reported nothing unusual and added that

ABIDIAN had not succeeded in losing the KGB surveillance at

any time during this period.

On 20 October 1966 NOSENKO was asked why, in his opinion,

In re

sponse, he told CIA for the first time that in about 1960 an

as he had earlier said, NOSENKO replied: "I don't

It seems to me

that I visited 1t, but I don't remember.

It seems that I visited

It with KOZIOV, but I cannot say 'yes,'

and I cannot say 'no."

As previously indicated, NOSENKO said that on the same day

AIDIAN was observed on Pushkin Street (1.e..

on 30 December

1961) the Chief of the KGB Surveillance Directorate, KOZLOV,

inspected the Pushkin.

street building.

The FBI had reported,

however. that KOZLoV was on

TDY in the United States from

15 November 1961 until leaving New York City on 30 December

1961, travelling via France.

The timing of ABIDIAN's visit to

Pushkin Street, at 0330 hours New York City (Eastern

Standard)

time, would appear to precluce the possibility of KOZLoV's having

gore to the dead drop site

on the day NOSENKO said he did.

The Pushkin Street dead drop site was proposed by PENKOV-

SKIY himself in the August 1960 letter by which he initi

ally contacted CIA. The only known visits by Americans to

this address and the only ones connected with its use as a

dead drop location occurred on 12 November and 4 December

1960, when CIA officer Eugene MAHONEY checked the address

from the outside, and on 21 January 1961, when MAHONEY

returned and entered the building to check the precise

dead drop location.

Physical Premises

NOSENKO has said that tie krowledgo of the physical

layout of the Embassy cerives boti from his gencral super-

visory function during 1960 and 1961 and fron nig respon

sibilities as the officially registerod custodian of the

KGB'o file on the security of the Erbassy.

According to

NOSIRO, he received the latter from his chief, xo!Sick,

when he arrives in the section in January 1960; shortly

thereafter he arranged by a phore call to the Secretariat

of the Second Chief Directorata to have custody transferied

officially to his name fron that of M.F. BAKHVALOV, his

predecessor as Deputy Chief of Section.

NOSENKO explained

that BAKHVALOV had already left the soction by this time

but that, under KGB pIcce lures, it bids perrissile for an

officer to remin official custodian of a file belonging

to the U.S. Embassy Section, even after leaving the imerican

Department, so long

as he remained

in the Second Chief

Directorate.

Until he turred

this

file over to GRYAZNOV

one else had access to it other than KoVSHut, Chief of

the

section, and GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPO!, who shared the office

and safe where this file was kept.

NOSENKO stated in February 1965 that he had never

studied the contents, nor had he paid any special attention

to this file.

Since

he would necessarily have been in a

position to know,

NOSENKO also said he is certain that no

operational analysis or

planning by himself er others was

done on the basis of this file during his two years in the

section. The file consisted of two volumos, one for the old

building on Mokhovaya Street and the second-about one inch

thick--concerning the new Embassy building on Chaykovskiy

Street, which was occupied in 1953. It was used only for

reference purposes, for the KGB had concluded that it was

impossible for a Soviet citizen to penetrate the secure

areas. of the Embassy because of the security precautions in

effect.

Apart from these file-custodial duties, NOSENKO was

generally interested in the floor plane of the Embassy.by

virtue of his position as Deputy. Chief of the section.

MOSENKO's knowledge of the Embassy premises is reflected in

the CIA debriefing of Februasy 1965, and these statementa

areas were of special interest to the Kus.

NOSENKO knew

no KGB employees who enterad tha secure areas during

1960 or 196i and had no personal contact with any of then.

He did not remenber any information that such KGB employees

ever reported to the KGB, except that Dmitriy I. KUKOLEV,

an electrician whom he personally handled in 1954-1955,

had observed antenna wiring in the attic, the details or

significance of the wiring were unknown to NOSENKO as of

1965.

that there was a sign

In 1960 a "metallie chamber" (acoustical room) arrived

at the Embassy for President Eisenhower's use and for

secret conversations.

NOSINKO was not certain where it was

located or whether it was ever used, but he heard from an.

unknown source that in 1960-1951 metings were held in a

secure roon in the "zone of Security."

He did not know any

of the technical details of this room.

The KGB accomplished only one theft of classified

material in any form from the U.S. Embassy durirg 1960

and 1961. A charwoman (name or cryptonym not reralled)..

who worked as an agent for the KGB officer Viktor BELOG

LAZOV, stole a bag of papers from the office of the Naval

Attaches.

Most of the papers were turn or crumpled. They

Includod a draft of a report of the Naval Attaches sighting

of ships and factories while on a trip to Leningrad. Since

this report was of only routine intercat to the KGB, NOSENKO

said, he was unable to recall any othor dotaila of the theft,

Including the date, except that the charwoman was granted

a cash award.

(ili) CIA Personnel Under Embassy Cover

According to NOSENKO, the Americans at the U.S. Embassy

of grantest counterintelligence interest to the KGB section

ware the identified CIA officers.

When questioned on 2

Septerber 1964 concerning his knowledge of intelligence per

sonnel assigned to the Embassy in 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO

stated that the KGB immediately listed any officer associated

with the offices of U.S. Armed Forces Attaches as a member

of Anerican Military Intelligence and any diplomat, as "suspect

American Intelligence," the latter notation always meaning

CIA.

One of the

ranks of the section was to determine whic

f. these diplorats was the CIA "Resident" (KGB nomenclature

for. Chief of Station), which were CIA case officers, and

which were the CIA agents or cooptees.

The KGB knew that

code clerks would not be used to fulfill intelligence missions

and that the sane probably held true for the Ambassador and

the Marine guards.

NOSENKO on 25 February 1965 signed a pro

, tocol which included his statament that, as Deputy Chief and

occasional Acting Chief of the section, he would

"necessarily

know whom the KGB knew or suspected to

be a CIA officer in the

Embassy."

NOSENKO has been shown lists of the names of all

American personnel assigned to the embassy during 1960 and

1961 and on a number of occasions has been asked to select

those known or suspected by the KGB to be CIA officers

George BLAKE, the KGB penecration of MI-6, was arrested

in London on 11 April 1961.

In his confession

he said that

he had passed the KGB a master list of the

names of persons

connected with the joint U.S.- British project with which

had been connected in Frankfurt, as well as other

materials on this project. On this basis,

was

relieved shortly thereafter of further duties

connected with

support of the PENKOVSKIY operation; he was withdrawn fron

Moscow in September 1961, less than a year after his arrival.

CIA records indicate that GARBLER was detailed to CIA

by the Navy in April 1952 and served

from January 1953 until July 1955. In the fall

of 1955, he resigned his naval commission, and in May 1956

On 3 June 196l, he returned to active duty with the Navy,

and on 31 August 1961 his appointment was announced as

Assistant Javal Attache to lescow, with the rank of Commander.

In. September 1961 his official biographic data was forwarded

to the office of the Soviet Naval Attache in Washington, who

had requested this information, and the same month GARBLER

made an official call at the Soviet Embassy.

GARBLER arrived

in Moscow on 29 November 1961. He was the CIA Chief of

Prior to his affiliation with CIA, GARBLER served in

Korea and there was acquainted with George BLAKE.

Electronie Operations Against the U.S. Embassy

(1) Introduction

NOSENKO had. three basic pleces of information on KGB

audio and other elcctronic operationg

against the U.S. Em-

bassy in loscow:

The presence of

microphones in the

chancery building, the absencé of audio-technical dovices

In the north wing of the Embassy, and the existence of a

bean which monitors

and jans transnissions fron the Embassy.

Thesê are discused separately below.

Except for knowing

that a resonant cavity

(wireless) nicrophone had been found

in the American Ambassador's residence in 1953, NOSENKO

said he was unaware of audio

surveillance devices and tech

niques (other than the chancery microphones) in use against

the Embassy, nor did he know of any material produced by

such measures.

NOSENKO told CIA on 14 May 1964 that, to.

the best of his knowledge, there mere no wireless micro-

phones (i.e., carrier transmitters and radio transmitters)

in the Embassy,* His Information on KGB electronic opera-

derives from his special responsibilities in this period;

from his 1953-1955

service in the American Department, NO-

SENKO said, he learned only that audio installations

existed.

(11) Microphones in the Chancery

Frequently described by NOSENKO as his most important

information, the microphones in the chancery building were

first mentioned by him during the 1962 meetiogs in Geneva.

In these and subsequent debrietings NOSENKO reported in de-

tail on the ways in which he acquired this information, on

the number and locations of the microphones, the quality of

reception, and the value of production.

He

has not given

the date when the microphones became operative, but pre-

sumed (in agreement with the KGB defector COLITSYN) that

they Were installed prior to 1953, when the chancery was oc

cupied by U.S. Government representatives.**

Of the 16

microphones listed by NOSENKO, he has stressed the impor

tance of the one in the office of the Minister Counsellor,

the existence of which was earlier reported by GOLITSYN and

subsequently confirmed by technical investigations. In

1962 NOSENKO said that the audibility of the nine-year-old

#NOSENKO stated that the KGB knew the identity of American

counter-audio technicians and therefore turned

off the micro-

phones whenever any of them arrived at the Embassy.

Since

a microphone-and-wire system cannot be turned off,

this re-

mark suggests either that there was an external power source

for the microphones,

which NOSENKO has not mentioned, or

that NOSENKO himself did not have rodimentary knowledge of

much matters.

•Tho Inventigations by American techniclans leave no doubt

that the microphone-ind-wire systen would have had to be

le nlace at the time of occupancy.

system

varied from very clear to zoro; he said in 1964

that the quality was deteriorating and that "in a year

or

two they (the microphones/ will be coopletely inoperative. ""

Although the microphones

produced a great deal of politi-

cal intelligence, NOSENKO said, he found nothing worthwhile

for use against U.S. code clerks or others oi operational

interest to him.**

All pertinent details fron KOSENKO and

other sources on the microphone system in the chancery

building is presented in the fol wing portions of this

paper.

(a) NOSENKO '5

Sources

Nearly all of NOSENKO's knowledge about the microphone

system in the chancery

building was, he said, derived fron

two circumstances:

Fitst,

his responsibility as Deputy

Chief of the KGB's U.S. Embassy Section, for receiving and

disseminating

transcripts.of conversations there; and

a special neeting which he attended in his dual capacity

Deputy Chief of the U.S.

Embassy Section and custodian of

the microphone information.

Additional inforzation was ob

tained by NOSENKO in 1962 and 1963 from G.I. GRYAZNOV, his

former

subordinate and his successor as Deputy Chief of the

Section.

In

several discussions with GRYAZNOV duting this

period NOSENKO learned that some of the microphones were

dead while others had become less efficient since NOSENKO'g

reassignment to the Tourist Departsent in January 1962.

NOSENKO's statements concerning his major sources óf infor

mation on the microphones are presented in chronological

order below.

"We are listening

to everything the military attaches

say in Moscow, the Military, Navy and Air Force Attaches,"

NOSENKO said

on 11 June 1962.

"All the reports go through

me.

I read them....Only a limited group of people read

these reports.

They are all in the First Department of the

Second Chief Directorate.

Who are they?

The Chief of the

Department (we don't give them to his deputies), the Chief

of the (U.S. Embassyl Section,

and I--altogether three people.

Sometimes

we report to GRIBANOV things

we consider important.

We conceal the fact that we are listening to

even send coded cables abbut me (to Moscow).

If you do it

will be the end of me....Only three people krow that we

are listening to you.

Even within the Second Chief Directo

rate it is a tremendous secret that ve are listening, to you."

NOSINKO was asked on 12 June 1962 about the form in which

he received the audio intercept reports and whether these

reports were delivered to his office:

He answered:

"No.

Tere's how it is done. We have a special unit concerned

On

every Embassy employee."

During the second of the 1964 series of meetings in

Geneva,

24 January, NOSENKO took a number of notes

from

his wallet.

Pointing

to. one of them, he said:

"This plece

of paper was kept in my operational

file and it represents

the statistics for the years

1960-1961, listing those micro-

phones which are actively used in monitoring conversations

in the U.S. Embassy."

This list named eleven offices aud

apartments in the chancery which contained microphones.

When asked whether he had copied the list from records

had drawn it up from memory,

NOSENKO explained that it came

from an operational

review of what "listening points we had

in the U.S. Embassy."

A detailed explanation of his acquisition of the written

list was supplied by NOSENKO on 14 May 1964:

Question:

How did this list come into your hands? What

caused you to write it?

NOSENKO:

Question:

NOS ENKO:

I came to KLYPIN (Chief of the American Depart-

ment] with my working notebook. KOVSHUK (Chief

of-the U.S. Embassy Section in the Department)

was writing and he put the list on my book.

KOVSHUK said this one (microphone] is orking

well, this one badly, and so on.

What was the date of this? What year and month?

Oh, I don't remember, 1960... aybe the beginning

of

1961.

Question:

At the end of 1960 or the begianing of 1961

you and KOVSHUK met in KLYPIN's office?

NOSENKO:

Or maybe it was at a meeting.

It de d1f-

ficult to

say.

Maybe we went to report to KOVSHl

in his room

or maybe KOVSHUK was writing in

KLYPI"'s study room.

I don't remember.

NOSENKO then described the purpose of the seeting::

cuss the possibility of releasing monitor positions from

some of the chancery nicrophones and of assigning these re-

leased positions to Vladinir (patronymic unknown. PETROV,

Chief of the American Department's section for work against

American tourists and delegates suspected of being con

nected with American Intelligence; PETROY had earlier re-

quested Englist-language monitoring positions from the Chief

of the English-Language Section of the OTU's Second Special

Department but had been told that all such interpreters were

already engaged on priority targets.

and KLYPIN reviewed the microphone coverage of the chancery

to decide which rooms offered information of little value

and which monitoring positions could be released to PETROV.

bringing it to ClA in 1964.

ther on the locations of microphones in the chancery building,

and much of his information concerning the quality and value

of the production by these microphones came from this

mecting.

Since his defection, NOSENKO has spoken further on his

responsibilities in coonection with the daily transcripts

received from the Second Special Department.

He said on

14 May 1964:

"All the materials after they were read and

signed were

returned to the Second (Special Department of the

Operational Trchnical Directorate.

Some of the material fron

this

was put in the individual file, but anyone sho read

it would never know where it came from.

He wouldn't know

that it came from mikes....KOVSHUK and I read all of this.

From this we gave information

to those who needed it, de-

pending on their interest.

esting,

it was given to KLYPIN to read.

If KLYPIN

saw

something interesting he could take it and give it to GRI-

BANOV.

Tatyana GRISHNYAT (from the Second Special Department)

came by car with this

material. She went to KLYPIN. Some-

times she left them with ne."

A protocol signed by NOSENKO in 1965 states:

my

duties as Deputy Chief, First Section, First Department,

to appropriate case officers the production from microphones.

in the Embassy garage.

These plans were vetoed, however, be-

For the same rea

there was no attempt rade in this pertod

to place temporary devices in Spasso House (the Ambassador'g

residence) or in the apartments of such Embassy officers

as John

The KGB was "afraid that they vill be

has said no microphone was installed).*

On-site recordiigs

nade fron twelve selected nicrophones in 1964 indicate that

the nicrophone in

the office occupied by the Minigter Counsel-

lor 1o 1960 was capable of producing tapes of "high intelli-

The 1964 tests of the nicrophones in

the silitary

the office

of the Naval Attache also produced recordings of high intell

gibility.

As pointed out belor, horever,

the possible pro

reduced by the installation of acoustical roons during 1982.

*As noted in Part VI.D. 3.e.,

NOSENKO reported that the U.s.

Dabassy officer Bichard HARMSTONE did not report his having

been approached by the XGB for recruitment in May 1959.

"To be perfectly frank, I would

some of our

assure that...some of our modus operand'our personal

targets, some of the results,

and all of

weaknesses were compronised.

This is not a very de-

finite answer; bowever, it is the best estimate I can

make."

In 1ts general introduction, the USIB damago report

states:

"Although

there

has been no observable indication

that the Soviets have acted in any manner to the detriment

of the United

States based upon Information considered pos.

sibly. comprouised, it must

be concluded that due to the ox

tensive period of

penetration, the cumulative effect has

resulted in serious damage to the United States.

"The

Soviets have gained considerable knowledge as to the effective-

ness of United

States operations within the, Soviet. Union,

particularly

the military attache collection progran.

Soviet knowledge of U.S. emphasis upon certain intelligence

collection areas has made it possible for then to identify

priority intelligence and probable Soviet targets and thereby

permitted them

to implement specific counteractions..

The

Soviets over the years must have

amassed considerable infor

mation concerning the personal habits, problens, attitudes

and weaknesses of personnel assigned to the Embassy which

can be used by them for purposes of exploitation at any

time of their choosing in the future."

The following extract from the USIB damage report con

corns the declining value of the production from the micro

phones in 1962 and 1963.*

"The

security practices and procedures appear to

have followed a pattern from April 1953 to May 1960, at

which time the first plastic room was installed.. A

change occurred in the work habits in that the nore

senior State Department officers utilized the plastic

room for sensitive discussions and dictation.

The

room could accommodate only a limited portion of the

Embassy classified discussions and accordingly, a number

of classified discussions were held outside this secure

In the April 1953-lay 1960 period it was an ac

cepted practice for the Ambassador and the Deputy

Chief of Mission to discuss openly in their offices

routine classified operations of the Embassy and to

dictate classified documents and telegrams....In Sep-

tember 1962, the second acoustic room was erected for

the typing section for the handling of sensitive classi

fled material. From December 1963 to date

it was indi

cated that no classified telegrams have been dictated

*As previously indicated, NOSENKO said that in 1962 and 1963

he learned thare was alnost no production from the labassy

microphones.

One reason was the natural decline in effi

clency of equipment installed ten years previously; the KGB

belleved that other reasons were

outside of the acoustic roons....The military attaches

reported that most cables were drafted in longhand or

typed by the originator and then turned over to the

code clerks for transmission.

In certain instarces

cables were dictated in

the offices.

There were nany

discussions in the offices

relating

to official duties,

office routine, proposed travel,

personal observations

and

normal office talk not specifically in themselves

considered classified.

From 1953 to 1959, sensitive

classified

matters

were discussed in whispers or to the

accompaniment of external noises, such as radios and

street noises.... In 1959 a secure

structed in the attache section

utilized for classified discussions and debriefings....

(111) Microphones in the North Wing

According to NOSENKO, no microphones or other audio devices

were installed in the north ring (as distinct from the chancery)

of the U.S. Embassy prior to its occupancy in 1962.

(For this

reason, NOSENKO advised CIA in 1962 to transfer its sensitive

offices gradually--to protect NOSENKO's security-fron the

chancery to the north wing at the Embassy.)

He has commented

several

times on this subject, and these remarks are presented

below.

11 June 1962: "The Embassy is now located on Chaykovskiy

SHELEPIN also wanted to,

It was already too late because this can

Gradually, gradually move them to the north wing of the build-

won't have anything."

31 January 1964:

"when the construction of this right

wing had begun, when you started the right wing, the

new addition to the building, there was a plan to install as

many (microphones) as possible--thirty, forty--stick them.

Yes, there is

NOSENKO:

NOSENKO:

It was this system,

he said,

Americans had intercepted

Because NOSENKO's true name and photographs had been submitted

to the U.S. Embassy

connection with this visa request,

NOSENKO added, it was henceforth

neceggary for him to use his

true name for all travel abroad.

c. The Cuba TDY (1960)

In November 1960, after and as

result of the cancellation

of his planned trip to

the United States, NOSENKC travelled

a delegation of nickel industry experts to cuba.

He first mer.-

tioned this trip on 11 June 1962,

In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in

the subject of his trip to Cuba came up again; NOSENKO re-

called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba

and that his function there was that of security officer.

Question: When did you travel to Cuba?

NOSENKO:

1960, November and December 1960.

Question:

NOSENKO :

sometime in November, with a group

automotive specialists, etc.

submitted for coordination and, in particular, my

name had been given to the American

Embassy there

(Moscow]. But the American Embassy announced that

this delegation could be accepted, but a little

later.

And my passport had already been iggued.

My passport had already been signed authorizing travel

abroad,

but it was a service passport, not a diplomatic

one. And at this moment a delegation was supposed to

they were lazy buns.

They would go to a lesson once and then

miss the next two and then perhaps go again, and again miss one

In september 1964 NOSENKO added that LEVINA had never

been targetted ayainst any particular individual and had never

provided any interesting reports on her Aperican contacts..

the end of 1960 or in the beginning of 1961, NOSENHO said, she

was released from the Emkassy by Paul SMITH, possibly because

NOSENKO turned LEVINA over to another officer be

a librarian from January 1958 through January 1962, when she

was released.

Overseas Assignments

a Attempt to Obtain Assignment in Ethiepia (1960)

During the first half of 1960, NOSENKO said, he applied for

a permanent overgeas assignment to Ethiopia because doctors had

prescribed a change of climate for his daughter Oksana's asthma.

O.M. GRIBANQV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, approved

his request, but then the KGB Personnel Department tuined

it

down when a

file review revealed

potentially dangerous character

weaknegses.

NOSENKO described this matter on 14 April 1964 as follows:

"Gennadiy GRYAZNOV came to the American Department of the Second

Chief Dircctorate in 1958.

• Before 1956 he was studying in the

Higher School of the KGB and when he finished the school in 1956

he was assigned to the KGB Personnel Department, and then he came

to the American Department in 1958.

SO GRYAZNOV had very good

cornections in the Personnel Depariment.

So in 1960, when I

wanted to leave, to yo abroad on permanent assignment I said to

GRIBANOV:

' Let

me go for two years to Ethiopia.'

When the Par-

sonnel Department refused to let me go, I decided I'd just have

to know what was there in my personal file.

I had to learr. what

it was that was causing all this.

By that time GRYAZNOV was in

the American Department of the Second Chief Directorate and hap

pened to be the head of the Party Organization of the entire

directorate, and he at one time had worked in the Personnel Office:

himself.

He srid:

'Give me this thing and I'll see what I can

find out about it. So he went to the Personnel Department and

through his friend there got my personal file.

Ther. he gave me

• call and said to come over.

I went to his office and he locked

the door.

Of course, he couldn't give me this file, couldn't

let me hold it in my

hands so to speak.

So he read this case

to me, this 1954 case to

about the woman and so forth," and

then said that at that time

ime they nade

an investigation of

ny

previous residence.

And they found out that while I was study-

ing at the Irstitute (of International Affairs) and was living

on Pervaya Meschangkaya Street, all sorts of girls visited me;

different girls,

new girl would visit me almost every week.

This wag

in my file.

Then

this case that took place in 1954.

And then

in 1960--and, incidentally,

GRIBANOV mentioned this to

me also--the file said that I was drinking quite a bit, and for

this reason I had many fights with my wife.

And that was all

that appeared in my file.

Nothing

else, whatsoever, besides

these things that I just mentioned.*

b. U.S. Visa Application (1960)

NOSENKO's true name appeared with 11 others on a 20 October

1960

reguest to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for visas for members

of a Soviet automotive exchange delegation which was scheduled

to visit the United States in mid-November 1960.* HOSENKO waS

listed as an engireer employed by the

State Scintifie-Technical

Conmittee (GNTK). After defecting, NOSENKO told CId that he had

been scheduled to accompany

this delegation as a secirity offi

cer but that the delegatior's visit to the linited States had

been postponed

at the last moment.

He therefore did not travel

to this country.

He further explaired, on 17 April 1964, Why his visa appli-

cation had been submitted

in true name and

under a different

cover:

•In 1957 and 1958 I went to London as NIKOLAYEV repIE-

senting

the Ministry

of culture.

Then in 1953 I didn't go anjo

where.

Then when this question cane

up

of my going

in 1960, I said: 'I'm rot

going.

I've been going under the

Ministry of Culture (coverl and with sports delegations.

This

has to be changed somelio: at this point.

So we thought about

it and finally sonebody said:.

So I said:

you decide." by that time my passport

vas ready, but the imericans ard the soviets hadn't come to ar

agreenent yet.

It was decided that this delegation rould go to

the U.S. in 1961."

NOSENKO was then

asked why he could not

have used the NIKOLAYEV name for his trip to

the United States.

He replied:

"Sure, I could have gone as NIFOLAYEV, but I just

didn't want

to.

Because, look, it was kroin to us that the

British and American Intelligence exchange information on people

they suspect of being kGs, and that the britisi, of course,

had probably watched me when i was

in England lin 1957 and

13581

and probably there it was noticed that here's this man

under

the cover of Ministry of Culture.

He's not a sportsman.

It

kind of looks suspicious.

Then he goes to the soviet Embassy.

Also suspicious.

So then I have to go to the States.

ind if

I go as NIKOLAYEV I couldn't use--in that case I couldn't uge

the game cover o! Ministry of Culture because of the type of

the delegation.

I'd have to use a different cover.

so I'd go

there and

they'd say:

'Aha, here's NIKOLAYEV under different

cover now."

But if I go as NOSENKO, the British never heard

the nano.

Nobody knows the name.

Everything would be o.k."

NOSENKO was then asked why he

could not have travelled under

sOme

other alias.

He answered:

"That's the way it wes de-

cided.

I guess

so as not to get all mixed up they decided to

send me as NOSENKO anyway. It's up to the people who are in

charge of these operations. They are the ones who decide."**

This visa application was submitted approximately six months

KGB rejected his request for PCS assignment to

Ethiopia.

** With regard to his trips to England in 1957 and 1958, NOSENKO

said that he had been forced to use the name NIKCLAYEV because

this was the name he had used with British citizens tama

Kus when they visited the Soviet Union in the summer of 1957; he

could not, he said, have shown up in England with another name

In the latter part of 1960, at the

time as he was preparing for his intended trip to the

United States,

celegation

of nickel industry experts

from Gosplan, the Soviet State Planning

Conmission, was prepar

ing for departure to Cuba.

The delegation was a routine one,

consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of the

Soviet Union, and since there was no one under any sort of sus-

picion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abicad) Department of

the Second Chief Directorate had decided that it would not be

necessary to include a security officer.

Two days prior to the

departure of the group, however, the Central Committee of the

Communist Party decided that a Second Chief Directorate case

officer must

go along.

Because of the short time remaining be-

The Bulgaria TDY ard the LUNT Case

In the spring of 1961; four monthe after returning from

Cuba,

NOSENKO was sent on

temporary assignment for about a

month to sofia, the only trip he cook in other than a security

watchdog" capacity.

According to NOSENKO, it happened this

way:

"I think I first heard that I was going to Bulgaria, a

week or so before I left, from S.I. YEGOROY, Chief of the

section having contact with the counterintelligence representa

tives of the Countries of the Peoples' Democracies in Yoscow.••

He said:

'You must go to Bulgaria.

GRIBANOV has decided.'

He asked, 'Do you know about this?'

and I said 'lo.'

He said:

'KLYPIN (Chief of the American Department) must tell you.'

But

this was the first I had heard about it.

YEGOROV said that the

Minister o! the Bulgarian MVR had requested the Chairman of the

KGB

send

an officer from the American Department of the Sec

ond Chief Directorate to Bulgaria for consultation with the

-American Department, Second

Directorate of the MVR of Bulgaria..

After one or sNo jays KLiPI! tola me about it.

He repeated

the same thirg and after about one and a half weeks I flew to

sofia."

The discussion continued as follows:

Question: What plans were made for this trip in Moscow before

you left?

What briefings or discussions were held

concerning what you were to do in Scia?

NOSENKO:

I was told:

"You are goirg for consultations. There

are KGB advisors there.

They will discuss it with

you. "

No one was speaking with me about my trip.

Question: What discussions did you have with your department

chief, KLYPIN, about what you were to do on this

trip?

NOSENKO:

Nothing.

He told me: "You will go. You will see

what they are doing.

You will tell them how to

work."

Question:

Did you have any meetings or discussions with the

representatives of the Bulgarian MVR in Moscow be

fore you left?

NOSENKO: NO.

Question: What discussions did you have with YEGOROV or his

section about what you were going to do in Sofia?

NOSENKO:

YEGOROV said:

"You will go. You will tell us what

they are doing."

Question: Before you left Moscow for Sofia did you know any-

thing about the size of the American Department of

the Bulgarian NVR?

NOSENKO:

No. Nothing.

Questions: Did you know the names of any of the officers of the

¿American Department. of the Bulgarian HVR?

NOSENKO: NO:

questions pid you know what any of their particular problems

were?

NOSENKO:

No.

Nothing.

Question: Did you know just what was the area of responsibility

of the American Department of the Bulgarian MVR?

NOSENKO: No. Nothing.

NOSENKO flew from Moscow in early April 1961 and was met

at the airport in Sofia by A.S. KOZLOV, a former

Second Chief

Directorate officer whom he had known in Moscow.*

The follo

ing morning he was picked up in an official vehicle and wes

taken to KOZLOV's office in the Bulgarian MVR building, not far

away.

NOSENKO asked KOZLOV what was expected of him and was

told that "they want to know about hoa

to work against the Ameri

can Legation.

He said he wanted ne

to tell them everything about

how to work, right from letter 'A.'*

NOSENKO was. then intro

duced to the Chief KGB advisor in Sofia, Mikhail YEGOROV, and

to the Chief of the MVR's American Department, after which he

was assigned an office in the MVR building.

During the ensuing

weeks he discussed both general matters and particular cases

with individual Bulgarian officers vorking aguinst the imerican

target.

On one occasion he lectured interested MVR officers

on the principles of operations against foreign military person-

nel in Moscow, and on another he visited an MVR surveillance

post opposite

the American Legation.

He discussed. KGB methods

of operations agains foreign tourists.

He also addressed the

entire American Department for about five hours and told them

"what is necessary, what to pay attention to, how to work."

At the end of his visit, sone time in mid-May, NOSENKO conferred

with the First Duputy Minister of the MVR about what had been

accomplished and his recommendations for improving operations

against Americans.

As an outgrowth of his TDY to Bulgaria, NOSENKO has pro-

vided one lead to a case in which he said he took personal part.

About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around

April 1961, NOSENKO was going over lists of foreigners who were

schedüled to visit Bulgaria: in the near future, and he came

acrosg the name Horace G. LUNT. NOSENKO

recalled that a man

named LINT who was a Slavic linguist had been reported to him

in 1958 or 1959 by one of his homosexual agents, VOLKOV Or

YEFREMOV, as a possible homosexual.

He asked the Bulgarians

whether this man was a specialist in Slavic languages.

the Bulgarian officers replied in the affirmative, NOSENKO de-

cided to check his recollection against KGB records and an

Immediate phone call was placed to Moscow,: asking for traces.

NOSENKO had earTier reported that YOZLOV had served as the

Chief of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate,

until 1953 and that, until about two years before going to

Bulgaria as a counterintelligence advisor, he had been

Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department.

For the two years

immediately prior to his Bulgarian assignment, he had been

Secretary of the Party Organization of the Second Chief

Directorate and was relieved of all other duties. Asked

why KOZLOV was unable to "advise" the Bulgarlang in this

instance, NOSENKO said that he was too busy advising on

higher levels and that he had been away from the work for

• number of years.:

A reply was received almost at once:

"Yes.

This

is the same

LUit who was in Moscow. Homosexual."

NOSENKO told CIA that

the KGB had never done anything with its knowledge of LUNT'g

homosexual proclivities and that the Bulgarian MVR had not pre-

viously known of then.

NOSENKO's description of what happened next is as follows:

"KOLLOY and the Chief of the American

Department were very in

terested.

KOZIOV said:

'George

[NOSENKO). you must help them.

They never recruited an American.'

I said that I would do what

I could.

The three of us went to see Ceneral DUMKOV, the

Chief of the Second Directorate,

Bulgarian MVR.

I asked them

if they had a honosexual agent.

They checked

and said they

had one who is an operational concact.

the department chiefs of the Second Chief Directorate and was

not in a good mood.

Why, I don't know.

le didn't understand

what KOZLOV was saying.

GRIBANOV thought that I, myself, wanted

to make the approach to LUNT.

KOZLOV got confused on the pione.

GRIBANOV asked to speak

to me. I took the phone.

"What are

you doing?' he said.

•You are not at home, you are abroad.

You were sent only for consultations, but you are living as if

you were at home.

'O.K., O.K. I wasn't going to do

anything.'

told

KOZLOV that even

if the Bulgar-

ians were to ask me, I could not do it myself.

YEGOROV became

upset.

He thought our position has bad because the Bulgarians

were

asking.

'What they ask, I will tell,' I said,

"but I am

not leaving

the office to go

any place of do anything.

I can

only advise them on how to make the record entries after he is

caught.

I can dictate the questions to be asked. But the

approach and recruitment I cannot do myself.'

"The Bulgarians never said anything to me about active

participation,

but they didn't know what to do.

I told them

to get two agents.

Maybe LUNT wouldn't like the first one.

The Bulgariang reported that LUNT wouldn't be there long.

to take pictures and make a pitch

The Chief of the American Department, KOVACHEV,

and the chief

of the section dealing with tourists and American

delegations were to make the recruitment. The approach was

made at the end of April, I think."

NOSENKO went on to say: "I was in the office during the

approach.

I told

them I would not leave.

'If you need my

advice,' I said,

"come to me.' KOZLOV and I were sitting in

his office. It was the end of April, I think, and the next

day I went on holiday. I don't know where or how they approached

LUNT.

I only advised

them that after the first conversation with

him they would know if he would be willing to cooperate.

in Geneva.

He volunteered the following:

NOSENKO has also varied on the timing of the operation

day. On 24 April 1964 he said: "I remember that it was at

They planted this man either next to him

or in the restaurant and, well, he net LUNT and they got te

gether and decided to meet with each other the same day or the

next day.

This was all done very rapidly."

According to Professor LUNT, the approach

actually took

place on 5 May 1961, following a visit to Moscow where he had

contacted an official in the U.S. Embassy.

He travelled on

9 May directly from Sofia to Yugoslavia, where he

ported the incident to U.S. Ambassador George KENNAN, an aca-

denic acquaintance.

LUNT told the Ambassador, and later CIA,

that he had visited Sofia on ore earlier occasion, from 8 to

28 November 1960.

this first trip he became involved

with one Georgi Velev ALEKSIEV, with whom he ergaged in homo

sexual relations on

at least five separate occasions and to

to sell on the black market.

5. Transfer to the Tourist Department in January 1962

In

the autumn of 1961 a decision was reached, on the basis

of NOSENKO's own request, to return him to the Tourist Depart

ment.

GRIBANOV had originally wanted to promote NOSENKO fron

the position of Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section to the

post of Deputy Chief of the American Department: NOSENKO's

superior and friend KOVSHUK had long had his eye on this job,

however, and was the personal choice of the Chief of the Ameri

can Department for it.

(In fact; NOSENKO said, KOVSHUK had

once held the job, losing it in 1959 because of some miabehavior.)

NOSENKO did not want to be placed in the difficult situation

which his own promotion to this post would have created.

NOSENKO

. described his transfer in the February 1965 interrogations. The

following is from a protocol signed on 26 February 1965:

"The decision for me to return to the Seventh (Tourist)

Departrent. in Jaruary 1962 was actually made in about Septem

ber or october 1y6d.

GRIBANOV planned to appoint me Deputy

Chief of the First (American) Department, but the new Chief

of the First Department, FELOSEYEV, wanted KOVSHUK to take

this position.

Since I did not want to be placed in this

position by GRIBANOV's order against the wishes of ELDOSEYEV,

I want to GRIBANOV and requested that I be transferred back

to the Seventh Department, in any position.

I had already

spoken to (V.D.) CHELNOKO!, who was then chief of the

Seventh Department, about this matter and he had suggested

that I go to GRIBANOV and ask to be returned to the Seventh

Department is Chief of the First (American-British-Canadian)

Section with the understanding that I would be appointed

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department as soon as this

position would be vacated by (B.A.) BALDIN who was retiring

in July 1962]. •GRIBANOV did not telà me his reasons.••

for wanting to appoint me Deputy Chief of the First Depart-

ment in late 1961 or for appointing me Section Chief and

later Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department in 1962.

He

did not discuss witi me my personal qualifications for.

each of these positions."

Aware of his impending transfer NOSENKO took the opportunity

during December 1961 to spend several hours each day in the Tour-

ist Department.

There he talked with Department Chief CHELNOKOV,

faniliarized himself with certain files of the American Tourist

Section, and discussed current operations and operational possi-

bilities with the officers assigned to this section. The formal

order for the transfer was signed by GRIBANOV on 24

or 25 Desen-

ber 1961 and NOSENKO officially signed over the ABIDIAN case file

and the U.&. Embassy security file to his successor as Deputy

Chief of the American Erbassy Section, G.I. GRYAZNOV, within the

next few days.*

As he had when he transferred from the Tourist

to the American Department in 1960, NOSENKO said, he took his

active agents and his safehouse on

Vorovskiy Street with him when

he turned to the Tourist Department in 1962.

These Specilic dates were arrived at under interrogation in

February 1965. On all earlier occasions NOSENKO had said

that he was transferred in January 1962 (or some later date)

he said in February 1965 that he was "officially" transferred

at the end of December and reported to his new position at

the beginning of January (see below).

Date of Transfer

NOSENKO has given different dates for the time when he left

the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Departmert to become

Chief of the American-British-Canadian Section of the Tourist

Department.

During the Geneva meetings of 1962 he said on

different occasions that this occurred in January 1962 and in

February 1962; in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling between

15 and 20 January 1962; and in February 1965 NOSINKO gave the

date as 2 or 3 canuary 1962.

He has also reported that he was

in the U.S. Embassy Section for three months after John ABIDIAN

serviced

the Pushkin Street dead drop (on 30 December 1961, thus

placing NOSENKO in the U.S.

Embassy Section until late March

Functions and Activities

As Chief of the American-British-Canadian Section of the

Tourist Department (hereafter in Part V.F. referred to as the

American Tourist Section) from January to July 1962, NOSENKO

said, he was responsible for planning and coordinating all

KGB activities against such tourists in the USSR as well as

for supervising the operational work of 15 subordinate case

officers.

He had no deputy.

NOSENKO told CIA that he required

several months at the beginning of 1962 "to get the feel of

things", "there were no accomplishmentg" on his part in the

initial period on this new job, and plans for handling the

influx of American tourists during the forthcoming 1962 season

consisted of studying files and continuing to work against the

tourists as in the past. NOSENKO was asked in February 1965 -

NOSENKO reported that his planned role in the

approach to Natalie BIENSTOCK (see Pact VI.D.2.) was prevented

by his preparations to leave for Geneva in March 1962.

Finally,

NOSENKO said he participated in the

KGB investigation

of Lee

Harvey OSWALD after P-esident KEINEDY's assassination in Novem

ber 1963 (see Part V. D.6.).

NOSENKO has indicated that his own operational work in 1962

to 1964 was limited to those cases cited above because of the

considerable anount of time spent on temporary duty assignments

outside Moscow during these two years.

In mid-February 1962,

soon after assuming the duties of chief of the Aterican Tourist

Section, he began to prepare for his first trip to Geneva, which

lasted

from 14 March until 15 June 1962 (see Part III.B.).

NOS

ENKO estimated that he had spent a total of six morths outside

Moscow in 1963 on temporary assignments.

These included a two

day trip to Odessa to meet FRIPPEL,

an inspection tour of the

Leningrad KGB organization,

a five-day trip to leningrad for a

conference on border control.

a week-long trip to Alma-Ata for

a conference on tourist travel with KGS representatives from

the Soviet Central Asian republics, and an eight- or ten-day

inspection trip to the Caucasus as a member of a tean headed by

GRIBANOV.

NOSENKO said he travelled to Gorkiy Oblast on 16-17

December 1963 to assist in the search for CHERSPANOV, who had

passed

top

secret documents to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (see

Part VI.D.7.C.).

3. NOSENKO's Agents

when NOSENKO returned to the Tourist Department in the

first days of 1962, he took with him the agents whom he had

been handling as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section.

These agents are listed below with a summary

ments concerning their use in 1962 and 1963.*

Arsene FRIPPEL:

FRIPPEL had been reassigned from Moscow in early 1961, but

NOSENKO continued to be the Second Chief Directorate case

cer in charge of any future KGB contacts with him.

Describing FRIPPEL'S

past service for the KGB on 15 June 1962, five months after he

he transferred to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO said:

"FRIPPEL was afraid and gave practically nothing..•

I recruited him but, speaking honestly, he

was not an agent." Nevertheless, NOSENKO said, the KGB hoped

that FRIPPEL would be reassigned to the USSR at some future

When FRIPPEL returned twice to the Soviet Union in

1963, NOSENKO met with him, once in Odessa and once in Moscow,

The only other agent. whom NOSENKO handled during

this

period was the American Alexander SVENCHANSKIY.

At that time

she was working as

an interpreter at the Russian Permanent

Exhibition in Moscow.

In 1960 or 1961 she. became an instructor

of the Greek language at the Institute of International Relations,

and some time in 1962 she got a job at the school of the Central

Cormittee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

NOSENKO next mentioned his approach to JOHNSON on 17 April

1964.

Although not immediately recalling JOHNSON's name, he

eventually rememtered that "it was semething like JOHNSON,

JOHNSTON, or something that starts with a

"J'" ard that he was

a Baptist irom the California coast.

NOSENKO placed the opera-

tion sometime in the summer of 1962, after his return to Moscow

from Geneva, because he also remembered wearing "just a coat,

no overcoat at the time."

JOHNSON, who had come to the Soviet

Union as a tourist, was knoim to be a socialist, and on this

basis the KGB Second Chief Directorate considered him as a

recruitment target.

When the

Second Chief Directorate checked

whether the KGB First Chief Directcrate would have any use for

JOHNSON as an agent, however, it learned there was no interest

In JOHNSON:

He had no access to important information,

and he

lived too far from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United

States for convenieni contact.

Several days later KGB surveillance observed JOHNSON

mailing some letters in Moscow.

When read by the KGB they were

found to be

him from writing letters and making anti-Soviet statements on

his return to the United States.

At about the same time there

was some sign that JOHNSON was a homosexual, and it was decided

to entrap him on this basis.

The sole reason was to halt

JOHNSON's criticism of the USSR - no recruitment has attempted.

because neither the Pirst nor the Second Chief Directorates

had any use for him as an agent and because the KGB had deter

mined that he probably would not accept a recruitment proposal

NOSENKO did not know why he was selected to make the

approach to JOHNSON, except. that "BOBKOV said I should go."

NOSENKO discussed the situation

him to type and sign a statement that

he would "not say anything derogatory about the Soviet Union."

JOHNSON did as he was told.

course, because we haven't seen him yet. But even that first

signal is very helpful:

So if he goes on a Soviet plene, they

will start watching him from the time the flight starts.

Now,.

as soon

as he crosses the border. he will be watched by the

border guards; he will be watched the entire route of his travel.

This is a very important busiress, because the main task in re-

gard to tourists is

to uncover within the gereral flow of tourists

those persons wao are of interest from the operational point of

view...

Let's just say that this person is processing a group

of American tourists who are going to the So-iet Union, and.

wt.en the processing is almost finished, annther person is added

to the group.

was added_at the last mirute.

So this is an indication.

what he /the agent/ was taught to pay attentic. to when he was

being trained in Moscow...

agency makes a request that a man be sent to the Sovict Union as

So they asked him: 'Are you afraid?

He says,

shaking.

But why should I be caught like an idict...'

His

pseudonym is 'AUD' and his last name is SVE:CHANSKIY. Well.

I'll give you all this later."

NOSENKO told CIA on 14 February 1964 that SVENCHANSKIY was

recruited in 1961 and that in 1963 he, Nossko, had taken over

the handling of this agent from Tourist Department case officer

Ye. N. NOSKOV. *

SVENCHANSKIY had sent the KG3 many open code

messages such

as those described above, and a number of these

messages have been considered to have been of definite opera-

tional interest.

NOSENKO identified SVENCHAISKIY as the presi

dent of "Afton fours" in New York City and the owner of a

Russian-language bookstore in Chicago.

There was some concern on the part of the KGB at the time

of the recruitment in 1960 or 1961, NOSENKO reported on 1 March:

1965, because SVENCHANSKIY had had cortacts with AMTORG in New

York City.

The KGB suspected he was an FBI agent, but in con

tacting SVENCHANSKIY in 1960 or 1961, NOSKOV decided that this

was not so and therefore recruited him. (Asked how it was de

termined that SVENQIANSKIY

was not an FBI agent, NOSENKO re-

plied: "NOSKOV felt it;" he had no further explanation.)

The

recruitment was based mainly on an agreement that Inturist

would send more business to SVENCHANSKIY if he cooperated.

NOSENKO also said SVENCHANSKIY had been arrested for black-

marketeering, but he did not elaborate on this statement.

NOSENKO took over the case from NOSKOV in September 1963,

and

his name was entered 'in the single-volume file of SVENCHANSKIY

as the handling officer as of that date.

Together with NOSKOV,

NOSENKO subsequently had two meetings with SVENCHANSKIY when

the latter travelled to the Soviet Union, one in September

and one towards the end. of 1963.

This by diself appeared suspicious to the KCB, bu

in addition, it was aloit this time that the agent came into con-

tact with KOTEN

NOSEIKO learned from BARKOVSKIY that KOTEN

"used to go to some wookstore that sells Soviet literature and

through a saleslady in this story whom KOlai knows, he became

acquainted with the agent. Who also used to go to this store.

After

that, he used

to meet with the agent without the saleslady."

On the basis of these incidents the First Chief Directorate

suspected that kOTEi had been directed specifically to this store

in order to meet ard "work on" the agent and that, having learned

that the agent had relatives "in Stantsiya Loo.

akout 17 k110-

meters from Sochi.. he had evidently received

the assigntent

(to visit the relatives) from American Intelligence.

Evidently

they had gotten on the rall of this agent and were

checking on

him. "

The KGB also had suspicions concerning the relatives,

former kulaks who were still well-off financially.

It was known

to the KGB, for example, that the agent had written his sister

in Startsiya loo that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union.

and

she had replied: "Is there any sense in your comirg here?"

KOTEN arrived in Moscow and then travelled to Socht.

From

there he sent a telegram to the agent's sister and her husband

in Stantsiya Loo, asking them to come to Sochi to see him.

When

they arrived at KOTE!'s hotel: however, the hotel administrator

told them that KOTEN was on an excursion and refused to allow

= meeting.

KOTIN then took it upor. himself to travel to Start-

siya loo where he eventually contacted and spoke to the rela-

tives.

In the course

of this meeting KOTEN took photographs

of the sister ard her husband and recorded a message from the

sister to the agent on a tape recorder he had brought along.

From this the KGB deduced that "U.S. Intelligence wants to

get

documentary data" and it therefore

decided to "try to get told

of KOTEN. "

There had already been some indication during KOTEY's

earlier trips to the USSR that he was a homosexual, but the

KGB had taken no action because KOTEN was believed to be a

loyal Communist Party member.

With these recent developments.

the situation had now changed. Although NOSENKO's superiors

were absent from KGB Headquarters at the time, immediate action

was required.

8. Arrest of BARGHOORS

Information. from NOSENKO

At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO

described the provocation

and

arrest of. Yale Uriveralty

Professor Frederick BARGHOORY in •late 1963; he was ques-

tioned farther on this case on 3 February

1964 and

again

shilo

waiting in Frankfurt to leave for the United Statos.

NOSENKO's most corprehensive statement, from which the

following paragraphs were largely drain, was made on 9 June

1964. $

On this last occagion

KOSENKO said that the pur

pose

of the KGB operation against BARGHOORY "as to retaliate

for persona non grata action

taken against three Sovietg

in New York CIty In the case of John W. BUTENSO and to

secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Sovlet in the

EUTENKO case who was jailed.

In Geneva, however, NOSENKO

maintained that the operation against BARGIOOPY

"was to

discourage future arrests

such

as that of IVAVOV the

jalled Sov.otl,

not because of any spacial importance of

IVANOV hinself."

NOSENKO said that in 1963 four KGB First Chief Direc

torate officers assigned

to the New York Legal Residency

were caught in operational activity in the United States.

Of the four, three had diplomatic immunity, but one vas a

chauffeur and had only a service passport.

The three

Soviet diplomats were held three or four hours by tho

American authorities and then released.

IVANOV, the chauf-

feur, was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity.

GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

learned of this arrest probably the next day and was directed

by KGB Chairman SEMICHASTNYY to take "necessary moasures."

GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office NOSENKO; A.G.

KOVALENKO, Chief of the Tourist Department; and G.I. GRYAZ

NOV and Ye.M. RASHCHEPOV, both Deputy Chiefs from the Ameri

After explaining the arrest, GRIBANOV

asked what information the Second Chief Directorate had on

any American-U.S. Embassy employee or tourist that could

*The detail of NOSENKO's information on the BARGHOORN case

rellects both the extent

of

the CIA debriefings and the

depth of his knowledge of this case. He did, in fact, fur

nish much of this information during his first 1964 meeting

with CIA.

NOSENKO was also able to describe at length

BARGHOORN's professional background, which gave rise to KGB

suspicions of intelligence affiliation, and he provided the

general outlines of other operational activity centering

around BARGHOORN during his 1963 trip to the Soviet Union.

**Three Soviets were arrested in Englewood, N.J., on 30 Octo

ber 1963 during a clandestine meeting with

the KGB agent,

BUTENKO, an American engineer.

Two of the Soviets,' G.A.

PAVLOV and Yu.A. ROMASHIN, were memberg of the Soviet Mis

sion to the United Nations; they claimed diplonatic immuni

ty and were released; a few days later they were declared

persona non grata along with a third Soviet, V.I. OLENEV,:

who was named In the charges by the U.S. Government, but was

not arrested

serve as material for an arrest.

RASHCHEPOV and GRYAZNOV

said that at that very moment there were three or four

American military attaches in Rostov and that, in the

opinion of the Anerican Department, these officers night

be carrying electronic apparatus.

It has know that they

had cameras,

that they had been taking

photographs, and that

they had been observed taking notes.

If pormitted,

they

could be arrested in Rostov beiore they took the return

plane to Moscow.

GRIBANOV wanted to know what other pos

sibilities existed and

instructed the two representatives

of the American Department to

write a report on this.

He

also told them to request permission to arrest aod search

the military attaches.

GRIBAYOV then asked what pertinent inforration was held

by the Tourist Department.

Ho was told that there were re-

latively few American tourists in the Soviet Union at that

time;* these included BARGHOORN, who was mentioned to GRI-

BANOV along with une other (name not recalled).: NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO reported, however, that the KGB had no. "strong"

materials against then.

They were ordered to make an im

mediate study of the situation and to report back to GRI-

BANOV as soon as possible.

Returning to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO

gathered the entire American Tourist Section in

their office.

In a general discussion, it was decided that

BARGHOORN was the only American on

whom the KGB had anything

worth consideration.

All the materials or BARGHOORN were

gathered together,

and NOSENKO and KOVALENKO took them to

GRIBANOV, explaining that he was the only possibility.

GRIBANOV

read all

the materials and was pleased with them;.

he was sure that BARGHOORN was connected with

American

Intelligence.

He then asked what could be done.

NOSENKO

and KOVALENKO reported that BARGHOORN was then

in Tbilisi

and that, in fact, Ye.N. NOSKOV (case oificer, American

Tourist

Section)

was in Tbilisi with a wonan doctor from

the KGB Operational Technical Directorate for the purpose

of working against BAGHUORN; the doctor had some special

item which had been used to make BARGECORN so violently sick

to his stonach that he had to be hospitalized.

While he

was in

the hospital, a careful search had been nade of his

belongings, but nothing of operational interest had been

found.

addition,

KGB agent was placed in BARGIOORN'S

room

a patient;

he

made anti-Soviet statements ard offered

BARGHOORN

"materials," but BARGHOORN did not rise to the

BARG HOORN

morning, and the KGB knew. from a phone tap

that he had an

appointment with Theodore ORCHARD of the British Embassy

at the Hotel Metropol the following evening.

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving

"unterials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow..

NOSENKO said that this

would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that this made

no difference to him.. He instructed NOSENKO and KOVALENKO

On another occasion, NOSENKO estimated their number at

"about: 60."

to locate an agent

who could be used to pass the damaglag

materdals

to BARGHOORN and told them to write a surmary of

BARGIOORN's background with a proposal that the Second

Chief Directorate arrest him "when he obtains materials

which are of interest to American Intelligence."

This was

to be

sent in letter form to SESICHASTNYY over GRIBANOV's

signature; the letter was not to indicate how BARGHOORY

was to receive the materials (i.e., the fact of provocation

was

not to be mentioned).

GRIBANOV took a one-page letter on BARGHOOPN, along

with a similar letter from GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV COn-

cerning the military attaches, to SENICH!SINYT.

Khile

the four--NOSENKO, KOVALENKO,

GRYAZNOV and KOVALENKD-

were waiting in GRIBAYOV's office for his return, GRYAZNOV

received a telephone call from the local keB organization

in Rostov informiny him that the military attaches were in

the air on their way back to Moscow.

Shortly thereafter,

CRIBANOV returned with the news that the Chairman of the

KGB

had approved the arrests of the military attaches as well

as BARGHOORN.

KHRUSHCHEV was absent fron Moscow at the

time, but SEMICHASTNTY had called BREZHNEV and

secured his

approval.*)

When GRIBANOV learned from GRYAZNOV that the nilitary

attaches were already

on their way back to Moscow, he be

cane furlous and sent GRYAZNOV Out

"to do the job

or die."

leanwhile,

arrangements were made with the

"Department I"

(the KGB element responsible for disinformation, subordinate

to the First Chief Directorate) to provide

some

materials

on rockets which could be passed to BARGHOORN.

while these

were being picked up, NOSENKO and KOVALENKO returned to

their office to plan the provocation.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance upon

hig arrival in Moscow.

At 1810 hours a radio message was

received from one of the surveillance cars that BARGHUORN

had gone to the U.S.

Embassy,

and it was decided that the

agent (nare not recalled, aged 25 to 30 years) would be

placed in contact with him as soon as he came out. The

KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appointment with ORCHARD of the

British Embassy at 1900 hours,

but at 1900 hours a report

was received that BARGHOORN had left the U.S. Embassy in

the American Ambassador's car. He was alone but

for the

Soviet driver. Nothing could be done while BARGHOORY was in

the moving car. A check on ORCHARD established that he was

In the downstairs hall of the hotel waiting.

It was there-

fore decided to approach BARGHOORN when he left the car at

the hotel.

#NOSENKO placed these events on the day before BARGHOORN re-

turned to Moscow from Tbilisi and on the day before BARGHOORN

was arrested. As indicated below, BARGHOORN returned from

Alma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October 1963 and was arrested.on

31 October 1963, six days later CIA records show that on

30 October, the day before the arrest, XHRUSHCHEV greeted

Lmotian Premier SOUVANNA Phouma on his arrival in Moscow and

Inter in the day attended a luncheon in his honor.

tir;

No

sooner had BARGHOORN stepped out of the car than

the agent approached.

"You are an American?" the agent

asked.

"Yes."

"Please take it," the agent said.

The

agent

put the packet containing the naterials on

rocketry

in BARGHOORN's inside. coat pocket and then ran off.

BARGHOORN had taken only one or two steps when he was

seized by NOSKOV and Petr POPTSOV, another case officer of

the American Tourist Section, and

told he was under arrest.

A surveillance car pulled up.

BARGHOORN was placed in the

car,

handcuffed (on GRIBANOV's orders, because the Soviets

arrested in the United States had received similar treat

ment) and driven to the 50th Section of the Militia, where

a room had been prepared.

L.I. YEFREMOV and K.G. KRUPNOV from the American

Tourist Section were waiting at the Militia station, KRUPNOV

to interrogate BARGIOORN and YETRENOV to be the interpreter.

When BARGHOORN was brought into the station, an "incident

report" form was filled out,

and a resolution was prepared

requesting permission to hold him 48 hours.

Between 0200

and 0300 hours BARGIOORN was taken to the KGB inner prison.

At 0400 hours the Tourist Departnent case officers were

released with instructions to report for duty at 0930

hours.

NOSENKO and the others went home.

KRUPNOV began the

questioning in Russian at 1000

hours the next day.

Although BARGHOORN speaks good Russian,

YEFRENOV remained in case he would be needed to interpret.

NOSENKO entered the room sevcral times during those sessions.

(Although NOSENKO did not want to reveal his face to BARG-

HOORN because he knew BARGHOORN would be released, GRIBANOV

had. told KOVALENKO that NOSENKO should be there when they

reached the point where BARGHOURN was to tell how he obtained

the damaging materials.)

The first sessions concentrated

on general

matters, such as BARGIOORY's life history.*

After one and one half hours of questioning, BARGROORY

agreed that the

materials

were on him when he was arrested,

but he maintained that they had been placed on his person.

He said that he thought they were "newspapers or something,"

that he did not know what they were. The closed package

was then opened and shown to BARGHOORN; it contained about

•20 to 25 pages of information on missiles.

"BARG HOORN

was not,

of course, given

a close look" at the materials.

been present on the day after the arrest.

Your date is absolutely right, but

this reminded me that it was soor after I had come in the

Seventh (Tourist) Department, Is this irportant?"

Question: How long had you been in the Seventh Department?

NOSENKO:

Now I remember that it was immediately - one or two

would be going to the Seventh (Departrent) already in

I was visiting the Severth already then.

I had not too many papers to turn over to the first

(American Department), and now I remember that I

moved to the Seventh

immediately (NOSENKO's emphasis)

after 1 January 1962.

b. Information from JOHNSON:

JOHNSON reported to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on 5 January

1962 that he experienced an

"incident with

Soviet plainclothes-

men in the Hotel Metropol earlier that day."

JOHNSON, who

arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961, told the consular officer

that "he was dining alone in the Hotel Metropol restaurant the

evening of 4 January when he was joined at his table by a Soviet

citizen who identified himself as a doctor from Riga.

(This

was NOSENKO's homosexual agent VOLKOV.)

According to JOHNSON,

little conversation transpired because the Riga

"doctor' spoke

English poorly.

Before JOHNSON left, however, the

doctor.

said he would like to chat with him and knew

student who

spoke English well.

JOHNSON then agreed to come by the 'doc-

tor's' room at the Metropol at 10:00 a.m. the next day. JOHNSON

said that he dropped by the 'doctor's"

room about 10:00 the

morning of January 5.

Soon after he entered, the

"doctor" and

his "student' friend

(NOSENKO's homosexual agent YEFREMOV)

began to make homosexual advances to him. He stated that he

protested and was rising to leave when two plainclothesmen

suddenly appeared in the room and announced that all were under

arrest.

JOHNSON was then taken to another room where he was

asked to sign a statement in Russian... le signed this state-

ment and was taken to a man in a third room who identified him-

self as the Chief of Police, Georgiy Ivarovich NIKOLOV.*

The

police chief first old him that Soviet lar had been violated

and that he, JOHNSON, could be imprisoned for three, five, or

perhaps even eight years. After proceeding in this vein for

NOSENKO frequently used the operational pseudonym Yuriv

Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV.

He has said that he was normally

called Georgiy, a variation of Yurly, by family and friends

in Moscow.

5. Attempt to Recruit BRAUNS

a. Informatior frOm NOSENKO:

NOSENKO made the following statement or. 2 February 1964:

"In 1962 some l'.S. citizen by the name of Forst BRAUNS came to

the soviet Union.

I mentioned him to you in 1962 but at that

time could not recall his name.*

Ne tried to recruit him bit

did not succeed.

He lived somewhere in leningred, and in 1342

he went back with the German troops to Germany.

And he served

in the German Army, and after the war te changed his name and

went to the USt and became a U.S. citizen.

He is either a

skilled mechanic or a worker.

His real name is different.- it is

Russian - because he changed his name when he was ir. Gernari."

NOSENKO were into the operation against DRAU'S in area-er

detail on 17 April 1964:

"This was K.C./ KRUPNOV's Case.

This fellow was a Russian and lived prior to the war in Lenin-

arad.

In 1942 he was in Tikhvin, near Lenirgrad,: when the

Germans came,

and when the Germans were retreating they took

him along and some other people,

local people.

and so he found

himself in Germany.

Now, in Germany, as he told his story, he

was kept in various prison camps and

when the war was over he

worked in West Germany and_then, in 1956 or 1957 or 1958 - I

don't remember. (which year? - he came to the United States and

settled dowr

Why we became interested in this fellow...

NOSENKO thought his name was somethirg like 'BRUNKS' or

•BRONX'/ is because he came from Russia.

So, according to

Soviet law. he never lost his Soviet citizenship..•

Leaving

with the Germans is interpreted as treason, as being a traitor

of your country.

So there was something to talk to him about.

Besides. KRUPNOV found out either in the Information Section

or some other section /of the KGB First Chief Directoratg/

that the man is working in some: very interesting: company that

makes computers or adding machines or some, other instruments.

But when I talked to him he already left the company. He

BARGEDORN, who had made five earlier trips to the

Soviet Union since 1955, arrived there

on 2 October 1963.

The

purpose of his visit, as stated in his visa application,

was to gather information for a book on how effectively the

Soviet Union was operating as a result of its political ed

ucation and political systen.

His itinerary took hin to

Leningrad from 2 to 7 October, to Moscow fron 7 to 10 Octo

ber,

Tbilisi from 10 to i7 October,

and short vistts to

Tashkent,

Bukhara, Samarkand, and Alma-Ata fron 17 to 25

October.

He flew

fron Alma-Ata to Noscow on 25 October and

was scheduled to leave for Warsaw on 31 October.

On the

latter date he was arrested and held by the KGB until

16 November when, at President Kennedy's intervention, he

was released and left the Soviet Union. BARGHOORN had no

intelligence mission.

Upon his return to the United States, BARGHOORN waS

debriefed by the U.S. Department of State

and by CIA.

His

information indicated a high degree of KGB operational in-

terest in him throughout the trip, including encounters with

at least five probable KGB agents during his first week

there:

an attractive waitress who invited him to "do the

town," a disenchanted intellectual in Leningrad, an attrac-

tive unattached girl who sat next to him on

the

flight from

Moscow to Tbilist, and two young Armenians whom he met his

first day in Tbilisi.*

The two Armenians were instrumental

in the drugging described by NOSENKO.

hotel on the day he arrived in Tbilisi, BARGHOORN met a

young man claiming to be a student at

the Leningrad Music

Conservatory.

They left the hotel for a walk and ran into

a friend of the student, a second young Armenian, and the

three of them went to a cafe for coffee.

None was available,

of operational interest throughout the trip.

He vaguely re-

called the girl on the plane but either did not know or had

forgotten details of any other specific activity. NOSENKO

said that none of this activity was directly related to the

provocation operation, which was based on a last minute de

cielon.

but the young student went to the kitchen "to arrange things,"

and

shortly thereafter "throe foul-tasting coffees"

appeared.

Within an hour, BARGHORN was in the hospital, acutely-ill.

He was assigned to a room where there was another patient,

and a woman doctor took care of his case.

He was in the

hospital for four days. During this period his clothes,:

notes, and other possessions were held by hospital authori

ties.

Upon his return to Moscow by air on 25 October, BARG-.

HOORN checked into the Metropol Hotel.

The next six days

were occupied by sightseeing

and appointments connected with

his research.

the late afternoon

of 31 October he called

on friends at the U.S. Embassy for cocktails, and

at 1910,

already 10 minutes late, be left in the Ambassador's car for

a dinner appointment (prearranged by telephone) at the Metro-

pol with Theodore ORCHARD, & British diplomat.

The KGB was called.

Within 30

minutes a KGB captain (BARGHOORN thought his name night

have been GORBUNSKIY) arrived and began to question him,

assisted by an interpreter named YEFREMOV.*

All question

were asked in Russian, and BARGHOOK answered most of then

in English.

The package of materials was opened and con-

tained, according to BARGHOORN, 13 or 14 photographs of

rockets.

This session lasted until about midnight and

centered around BARGHOORN's possession of the photographs

and his "intelligence mission."

He was then taken to the

Lyubyanka prison.

Interrogations were conducted the next mornirg by the

original KGB officer together with his "chief," whom BARG-

HOORN subsequently identified by photograph as NOSENKO.

The

questioning concerned BARGHOORN's biography, and nothing was

asked about the compromising raterials.

The following day

the case was turned over to a KGB colonel identified as ({nu)

PETRENKO,

and BARGHOORN did not see NOSENKO or the other KGB

officer

again.

At this and subsequent sessions, BARGHOORN

was questioned further concerning the circumstances of his

arrest.

BARGHOORN described NOSENKO as "clever and quick-

witted" and as giving

"the impression that he ras not a

dedicated careerist,

but opportunistic and adaptive; he

seemed not to care

about what he was doing, but doing a good

Job nevertheless."

#Asked why YEFREMOV used his true name during the interro-

gations, NOSENKO said this was necessary for legal reasons.

that he bad to sign documents connected with the interroga

tions.

BARGHOORN confirmed that YEFREMOV had participated

throughout the. entire series of interrogations and had

signed interrogation reports attesting to the accuracy of

translation.

10. BOLSHAKOV, Robert Kennedy, and the Cuban Missile Crisis

a. Iatroduction

XOSENKO volunteered at his s+cond meeting with CIA

in January 1904 that G.X. BOLSHAKOY was his "old friend"

and that he was a colonel in the CRU.

On 26 January,

I February, and 19 August 1964 he again raised BOLSHAKOV's

name,

exphasizing that he was a GRU officer and a "good

friend."

In the 1 February interview, after displaying an

initial reluctance to discuss with CIA such a "sensitive"

subject, he provided a number of details on BOLSHAKOV's

alleged

rclationship in 1962 with tle then Attorney General,

Robert Kennedy.

His information on this subject,

he said,

derived from his friendship with BOLSHAKOY in Moscow, where

BOLSHAKOV was reassigned (in December 1962 following a tour

in Washington as Novosti correspondent and editor of the

magazine USSR).

JOSENKO claimed a personal role in this

afrair,

in that: he personally proposed to the KGB leader-

ship

that the KGB take

over BOLSHAKOV's former (GRU) COn-

tact with Robert Kennedy.

NOSENKO claimed that an information channel of coa

munication between BOLSHAKOV and the Attorney Ceneral had

developed at Kennedy's initiative.

He described in detali

the circumstances of their introduction at & social function

by a journalist (whom he did not name).

He

said that he

"thought" that the Kennedys knew that BOLSIAKO! was a

"military intelligence officer," and he implied that they

regarded these private conversations with BOLSHAKOV as &

useful instrumont of diplomacy.

According to YOSENKO, the

KGB knew that CIA was not aware of this relationship-it

was "obvious" that Robert Kennedy wanted it that way..

NOSENKO claimed that after BOLSHAKOV left the United States

"during the Cuban missile crisis,"* no one took over his

role as a confidential channel to the White House. After

the assassination of the President, NOSENKO continued, the

Kennedy family tried to reestablish the relationship through

their close triend, the artist Willian. WALTOS,

during the

latter's visit to Moscow in December 1963.

NOSENKO reported

that he had urged

that the KGB try to take over the Robert

Kennedy operation from the GRU and that he had proposed two

plans which would have enabled this to take place, the

second involving WALTON.

Neither came to fruition, however.

Referring to the Cuban missile crisis, NOSEYKO said that the

GRU had "played dirty" with BOLSHAKOV by forcing him to "tell

Robert" that there were no offensive missiles in Cuba whereas

there actually were such weapons there.

According to other

sources, BOLSHAKOV left Washington

for Moscow on 3 August 1962 and returned on 2 October 1962.

C.

NOSESKO's Statements on BOLSHAKOV

NOSENKO repeatedly emphasized BOLSHAKOV's CRU affilia-

tion

fact that the KGB was in no way involved in

+r.15

charnel to the U.S. Coverrment via Robert Kennedy.

He first volunteered BOLSHAKOY's nase during a discussion

of the use of Novosti as

a cover

organization for Soviet

Intelligence officers.

"Jury BOLSilAkOV of the GRU also

sits there, " he said.

"He is a colonel and a friend of

mine."

Two days

later,

out of context with

the preceding

discussion, he introduced the name again:

"Then

there is

this BOLSHAKOV.

He 1s

from GRU who was in the United

States."

NOSENKO then cormented that this was "a very in

teresting casc" and added:

"We shall talk about it later."

When his case

oflicer trer-upon turned to

another topic,

NOSENKO immediately interrupted to say:

"I knOw BOLSHAKOV

very well.

He is my old

friend...I met him through Yurly

GUk... who was with hin in the

United States...and we are

now very good friends.

He calls me up and consults me for

advice...

On 1 February 1964 NOSE:KO said he thought the

Kennedy family knew BOLSHAKOV to be a military inteiligence

officer; "yet for sore reason they chose him"' as a channel

between the U.S. ard Soviet Goverrments.

BOLSHIAKOV, NO-

SENKO

added,

"reported directly" to

the Chief of the GRU

concerning his exchanges with Robert Kennedy.

SOSENKO Said BOLSHAKOY was introduced to Robert Kennedy

by an

American journalist

(unnamed) at z ricoption in the

United States.

The jourralist invited BOLSHAKOV to go for

a walk,

and as they

strolled "down an alley," there was a

man sitting

on a bench dircotly ah-ad of thet.

"The jour-

nalist said:

'Listen,

George (BOLSHAKOV|, are you acquainted

with Robert Kennedy,

the brothar of tha President and the

Chief of the Department of Justice?'

BOLSTAKOV said:

'No.

Of course, I have heard of him.

•Would you like me to

introduce you?'

"Of course,' BOLSHAKOV said,

"please do.'

He lcd him to the man on the banch.

There was this feeling

that all this had been pra-arranged."

This contact'was at the personal desire of Bob Kennedy..•

BOLSHAKOV was called ia for this.

As you know, the whole

idea of this contact was to pass

informatior. to Kennedy

from KIPESHCHEV and from Kernedy to KHRLSHCHEV....It happened

to be BOLSHAKOV, but it was not BOLSHAKOV who sought to

bave the mecting....Then the relationship grew.

BOLSHAKOV

was a visitor in Robert Kennedy's house.

They would first

talk about ordinary things,

and then the conversation

turned to other mattars...Robert Kennedy did not sayided

•Please tell KHRUSHCHEV so-and-s0."

He would say:

know, some of these problens seem

insoivable." And BOL-

SHAKOV would say:

'And you know, at home they think this

and that

way...

without sctually

saying that this was coming

from KHRUSHCHEV.

But, of course,

this was clear sithout

explanations.

It was

ar exchange of views on important poll

tical questions of the moment.

He was like an intermediate

point...**

NOSENKO commented that he personally thought

that it vas a "case of mutual

'feelers' being sent out by

both sides exploring some given current political situation."

After BOLSHAKOV left Washington, NOSENKO stated, no one

replaced him as a chanrel to the U.S. Government.

departure, NOSENKO said: "Oh, no.. There is no contact.

like there was before.

It was broken at the time BOL

SHAKOV left. ZINCHUY was an agent of a cooptre....No,

there is no

such contact since BOLSHAKOV left. He passes

no more messages.

Referring to the Kennedy-BOLSHAKOV contacts, NOSENKO

told CIA on 26 January 1964:

"You have shown considerable

interest in him ! BOLS!LAKOV|, even after his return to the

Soviet Union...because all this was done by by-passing ClA."

He said on 1 February 1961:

"It was pretty obvious that

this

relationship between BOLSHAKOV and Robert Kennedy had

nothing to do witb ClA,

and CIA was not witting of 1t.

It

was at the perschal dosire of Bob Kennedy."

The KGB

determined that CIA was ureware of the exchange between

Kennedy and BOLSHAKOV, NOSENKO reported, because when BOL-

SHAKOV was subsequently invited to a reception at the U.S.

Embassy

in Moscow, two CIA officers-Kenneth A. KERST and

Malcolm A. TOON-tried to elicit information from him

about his relatlorship with President Kennedy.

"The most.

important thing" they had tried to find out,

according to

NOSENKO, was whetter the President and BOLSHAKOV had met

personally.

Although BOLSHAKOV did not adnit the fact to

them, he did have one

meeting with President Kennedy-"he

was brought in a car...and was taken

through a back door

into the ihite House, "

NOSENKO said.

NOSENKO reported that Will am WALTON visited Moscow:in Docen-

ber 1963 and at that time went to BOLSHAKOV, whom he had

previously met at the home of Robert Kennedy.

Part of

their conversations, he continued, related to Robert Kennedy'g

future political plans:

"WALTON

said that Boboy. did not

expect at present

to become a candidate for the vice presi

dency.

He was, perhaps, according to WALTON, thinking of

running for Governor

of llassachusetts..."

NOSENKO said he

felt that there sere "some feelers sent out on

the part of

WALTON not exactly questions, but just a passing of opinion®

WALTON was trying to sound them out, but I think that every

thing was left without an answer....My personal opinion was

that these things were told to WALTON so that he could

them on as, so to speak,

Bouby's plans for the future. "Pass

Another topic covered in the WALTON-BOLSHAKOV discussions,

NOSENKO added, was the assassination of President Kennedy.

"As I remember, it was WALTON's opinion and bis opinion re-

flected the opinion of the Kennedy family-that there was

no Russian Involvement in the murder of the President. No

suspicion at all."

NOSENKO proposed two plans whereby the KGB could take

over the GRU's channel to President Kennedy.

Under the

first of these plans, the Soviet Minister of Justice would

personally invite the Attorney General to come: to the Soviet

Union.

There the KGB would "set him up in private. llving

He have a system of tine in grade:

From major

to lieutenant colonel it is necessary to have four years.

My time in

grade was up in December, in December of last

year (1961)."

23 January 1964:

At the first of his 1964 meetings

CIt in Geneva TOSENKO had in his possession the ten

porary duty authorization which he said he had been issued

in December 1963 to travel ¿rom Moscow to Gorkly Oblast in

connection with the search for CHEREPAYOV.* This official

AuB paper had been signed by O.J. GRIBAYOV, Chief of the

second Chief Directorate, and authorized. "Licutenant Colonel

Yurly Ivanovich NOSENKO to visit the local KGB organiza-

tion in Gorkig Oblast on official business between 15 and

30 December 1963."

It bure official starps of arrival and

departure in December 1963, as attested by oificials in the

town of Shakhunya.

10 February 1964:

In Frankfurt, while awaiting er

filtration to the UnIted States, NOSENKO was asked to review

a biographic statement which had been prepared by his case

officers on the basis of statements he had made during the

1962 and 1964 meetings in Geneva.

NOSENKO went over the

biography carefully, noted several changes, and then stated

that it was correct.

The biography included the inforration

that NOSENKO had served in the U.S. Embassy Section of the

American Department as a senior lieutenant from 1952 (sic)

to 1955, that he was promoted to captain in 1956, to major

In 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963, shortls

before leaving Moscow for Geneva.

8 April 1964: NOSENKO was questioned about the date

when he became a senior lieutenant, and he replied:

think in the end of '53 or the beginning of '54 I got the

senior lieutenant."

Question:

That's less

than a year after you entered the

serr ice (KGB).

• NOSENKO:

Well, I had the GRU service. That counts two

years, as military service, of course.

it was

considered as a contaruance of military service.

Question:

NOSENKO:

So you got it when? At tha end of 1953?

At the end of 853 or bezinding of '54. Then I

got captain in 1956.

Question:

When in 1956?

NOSENKO:

I don't remember.

You see, they are not given

exactly in February or in Jarch.

Sometimes the

scheduled tine

passes before they give it.

SO,

'56-Captain, '59--lajor, and '63-.

16 June 1964:

Asked to list in chronological order the

date

of his promotions within the KGB from the date of

entry, NOSENKO stated:

"I began in the GRU as a junior

lieutenant.

while in the GRY I became a lieutenant: and I

entered the KGB with this rark in 1953.

Not long after I

entered the KGB I became a senior lieutenant, but I don't

know the month. It was still 1953.

In 1956 I was promoted

to the rank of captain.

I don't know the month.

I became

a najor in 1959.

I don't know the month.

In October 1963

I wi. made a licutenant colonel....Personnel called

me on

the elephone and said I had been promoted. Later I was

told that GRIBANOV wanted to see me. I went to his offico,

but, of course, I didn't let hin know that I already knew

that I had been promoted.

He gave me his congratulations.

You never see the attestation. It goes into your official

file."

26 January 1965:

While discussing his role as case

officor for U.J. Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN,

NOSENKO volunteered out of context that he had never offi

clally been a najor.

He explained this situation as

follows:

Having been promoted to the rank of senior

lieutenant in April 1953, ho vecame eligible for the rank

of captain in 1956.

When this time came, however, he was

not promoted because a senior KGB official held against

him his illegal use

Of_KGB_ documents to cover treatment for

gonorrhea in 1954.

- NOSENKO therefore remained a senior

lieutenant until 1959, when he would have been eligible

for promotion to the rank of major had he received his

captaincy on schedule.

Altlough GRIBANOV had promised NO-

SENKO that he would be promoted directly from senjor lieu-

tenant to major, skipping

the rank

of captain, an admihi

strative error was made by the KGB Personnel Office,

and

NOSENKO found when the orders were issued that he had in

stead been promoted only to captais.

Instead of rectifying

this mistake, GRIBANOV persuaded NOSENKO that it would be

to his advantage

to remain a captain until he became eligible

for promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1963.

NOSENKO there

fore was a captain from September or October 1959 until

October 1963 when, as promised by GRIBANOV, he was promoted

In-this manner it

turned out that

he

never officially held the rank of major.

10 August 1965; Under questioning by DERYABIN, NOSESKO

repeated the chronology of his promotions glven on 26 January

1965. He again explained that he was put up for captain in

Asked why he had told CIA that he

had been a major during the 1962 meetings and again in the

blography prepared in Frankfurt, NOSENKO replied that he

thought the true story would not be believed.

17 April 1966:

In a voluntary statement, NOSENKO wrote

the

following: "To March

2951, with the rank of jundor lieu-

tanant, I started service in Naval Intelligence of the Seventh

Flcit in Sovetskaya Gavan...Fron August 1952 until 1953, I

fo: the rank of major.

I lave never held the rank of lieuten

ant colonel and the travel cide: which you know of, with the

rank of lieutenant colorcl, was filled out erroneously.**

19 April 1966:

In a new version of his autobiography,

NOSENKO Included The following statement:

"in July 1956.1

became a candidate member of the CPSU, soon after which I re

ceived a promotion at work: I became a senior case officer

and was given the rank of serior licutenant. In August 1957

I was accepted into the OPSU, and during the second half of

1958 was appointed Deputy Chief of the Second Section, Seventh

Department.

On 29 Decenber 1959 I was pronoted to the rank of

captain.

26 October 1966: "I lied when I said I was a lieutenant

colonel in 1954.

-Twas only a captain."

Asked why he had

said in 1962 that he was then a major, NOSESKO replied:

"There was no conversation about rank in 1962.

About my po-

sition, I said I was in the Tourist Department. That's all."

To summarize what NOSENKO has said about his ranks while

•serving in the KGB:

He became a senior ileutenant in 1952,

April 1953, 1954, or 1956; a captain ir. 1956 or September/Octo-

ber/December 1959: a major in December 1958 or 1959; and &

lieutenant colonel in October/November 1963.

(The latter

claim was verified by the official KCB document listing him as

= lieutenant colonel as of December 1963.).

On the other hand,.

NOSENKO has indicated that his highest rank in the KGB was

captain, and that he never advanced

to a majority or a lleu..

tenant colonelcy.

*At about this time, in carly 1965,

NOSENKO was only a captain and had

advanced to his

senior

KGB position because of his close relationship. with GRIBAYOV®

made it "appear quite certain" that NOSENKO was a Ileutenant

Awards and Decorations

Not long alter reestablishing contact with CIA in

January 1964, NOSENKO mentioned that he had received the

Order of Lenin

"shortly after the 1962 meetirgs" in Geneva

as a reward

for the ideas which he had developed to "en..

large the experience and improve the quality" of KGB Second

Chief Directorate.staff.personnel in Joscow.* Diring the

first series of interrogations, NOSEYKO on 6 April 1964.

claimed that he was awarded the Order

of Lenin in 1963 for

his work in the Tourist Department, KGB Second Chief Direc

torate, after receiving the Order of the Red Banner in 1962

for his performances while in the American Department.

The following discussion of the subject took place on

6 April 1964:

JOSENKO: • Yes, -I received a big gold nedal.

Department got the Order of Lenin?

NOSENKO: Yes.

#NOSENKO has described the Order of Lenin as the highest

decoration for which a KGB officer can be eligible.

#*In June 1964 NOSENKO said that the only Second Chief Direc

torate officer whom he knew to have received this award was

V.A. CHURANOV, Chief of the British Embassy Section, who re-

cruited William John VASSALL, (see PART VI.D.S.b.) •

tioning concerning

"In 1962 I had ten years of service in

I had ten years of service then."

pointed out that,

according to his most recent statement,

he had joined the KGB in March 1953 and therefore would

have had only nine years of service in 1962, NOSENKO said he

did not understand why but that he was certain that he had

been given the medal, after his return from Geneva in 1962.

(The 1962 date is consistent with NOSENKO"s earlier statenents

that he joined the KGB in 1952.).

The following day, 17 April

1964, NOSENKO said that he remembered why he had received

the medal in 1962 ratber than 1963; this medal, he recalled,

is awarded to servicemen as well as KGB officers, and prior

military service is taken into account in computing the

service time for the latter. NOSENKO had: entered the GRU:

in 1950 and therefore should have received the ten-year

medal in 1960. Beesuse o. a nix-up In the -KGB Personnel

H. NOSENKO's Relationship with GRIBAYOV

1: Information from NCSENKO

a. Summary

From the time of his first meetings with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO

maintained that he had a close personal and professional

relation

Ship with Major General O.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of tre second Chief

Directorate.

NOSENKO has described recruitment approaches in which

he and GRIBANOV took part together,

conversations they had on opera-

tional matters, the role which GRIBNOV played in his rank promo-

tions and receipt of various awards, and his afterhours carousing

with GRIBANOV and First Chief Directorate ccunterinteiligence

officer Ye.A. TARABRIN.

NOSENKO has also frequently mentioned the

role which GRIBANOV played in his, HOSENKO's, professional advance-

ment within the KGB:

GRIPANOV was wholly responsible, against

NOSENKO's wishes, for his appointment to the position

of Deputy

Chief of the U.S. Embassy

Section of the American Department

in

January 1960; later, when NOSENKO rejected his offer to make him

Deputy Chief of the

entire American Department,

GRIBANOV arranged

his return to the tourist Department as Chief of the American

Tourist Sectior. and

his later appointment as Deputy Chief of the

Tourist Department.

NOSENKO's remarks concerning his direct involvement with

GRIBANOV in operations against Americans are included in other

parts of this paper.

Among them

are his early statements on the

approach to code clerk James STORSBERG

(Part V.E.3.c.), bis 1962

account of the arresi and attempt to recruit CIA sificer Eussell

LANGELLE (Part Vi.D. 7.a.), and his early reports on the attempt to

rècruit CIA officer

Edward Ellis SMIIi (Part VI.D.2.).

In all

three cases NOSENKO subsequently denied having played

the role he

originally attributed to himself and denied having had personal

contact with the Anericans involved.

NOSENKO has also altered his

original accounts to say that he received no awards or decoration

for operational activity and that he had not received the promo-

tions he claimed.

b. Details

The statements of NOSENKO given below concern primarily his

personal relationship with GRIBANOV and how GRIBANOV assisted

his rapid rise within the organization of the Second Chief Direc-.

12 June 1962:

"Oleg Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV is a great guy.

A real pal.

We,

so to say, used to meet one ancter illegall

and had women together...

me.

experience, who have made recruitments.

the people he is moving aheadl.

One of NOSENKO'S CIA handlers suggested at

this point that GRIBANOV seemed

to treat NOSENKO as an older

brother would.

NOSENKO replied:

"That's his attituce toward ne."

23 April 1964

Question: • Did you ever go to GRIBAliOV's house?

NOSENKO: I never went in the house. I have driven to it.

Question: . Did he ever come to your house?

NOSENKO:

No.

Question:

Were you ever out at night with him, after work?

If so, how, under what circumstances?

NOSENKO:

After work? Yes, once.

Who else was there?

Question:

NOSENKO:

Question:

NOSENKO :

TARABRIN.

What was the occasion?

No specific reason.

GRIBANOV called me at midnight.

Question:

NOSENKO:

the evening...

GRIBANOV was sloppy drunk, lay down

co rest,

he

needed a couple of hours of sleep.

I

drove him and TARABRIN home,

got him there at

6:00

a.m., gave him some pills to

help him.

When did you first personally meet GRIBANOV?

I might have seen him in 1953 or 1954, but I did not

nave a chance to speak to him then.

Once I was in two

Question:

shen did you first have any personal conversation with

NOSENKO:

Question:

NOSENKO :

I don't remember. He gathered groups of people:

Maybe I was with him with KOZLOV and

others in Tourist

Department li.e., between 1955 and 1960).

When did you develop a personal relationship with him?

It is difficult to gay how it got started.

I was

still working in tre Seventh

Department.

It was in

1958, 0r maybe 1957.

KOZLOV suddenly called me and

said

I should immediately report to GRIBANOV.

I did,

and GRIBANOV said:I should quickly be ready to go to

a reception with him at the Indian Embassy, with him

and Vera [Ivanovna] ANDREYEVA.

Question: Why you?

NOSENKO:

I don't know...

Oh, yes, this is the story.

this is it, this is

why he started favoring me.

Earlier,

some time in 1953, I knew some gills, Nira

on

Pokrovskiy Boulevard and her girlfriend, Rina GUDKOVA,

friends of (Yu.I.] GUK and [V.M.) KOVSHUK and (V.A.)

CHURANOV.

CHURANOV was a friend of TARABRIN, who was

a friend

of GRIBANOV.

Through TARAERIN he got acquainted

with these girls, and TARABRIN brought them to GRIBANOV' s

dacha one night.

The girls were talkative and told me

all about it, and said they'd told CHURANOV. I told

CHURANOV who warned me not

to mention it.

I never did,

and GRIBANOV learned about this and liked it; he re-

marked once: "You are not a gossiper..."

Question:

How did he find out that you knew and didn't tell any

one?

NOSENKO:

Question:

NOSENKO:

I don't know, but he did.

Who wrote your fitness reports?

My last one was written by (V.D.] CHELNOKOV. The one

before that by (V.A.) KLYPIN, in the First Department.

Before that in the Seventh Department it was written

by [K.N.] DUBAS, before him by (V.A.l KOZLOV,

then

(S.V.) PERFILYEV and before then, in the first Depart-

ment, by (A.M. I GORBATENKO.

Question:

NOSENKO:

Did GRIBANOV ever write a fitness report on you?

He may not have actually written them, but he signed

them, those reports written

connection with pro-

motions to higher jobs or for trips abroad, or general

reviews of personnel.

15 February 1965 (from a protocol signed: 20 February 1965):

"Before I Joined the KGB In 1953 I had never heard the name of

SHUBNYAKOV rather than GRIBANOV, was the Deputy Director of the

Second Chief Directorate responsible for supervising the acti

vities of the First Department of the Directorate, where I worked,

It may have been several months after I

began ry. KGS service that

first came to my attention.

don't know when I first

aw GRIBA:OV but it may have been approximately 1953 at. a meetirg

before May Day or the 7 November holiday.

I would not necessarily

remember this as I frequently met much more important

people, who

were friends of my father, and seeing GRIPANOV wouidn't have

particularly important to me.

Sometimes during 1954 and 1955, it

was necessary to obtain the signature of a

Deputy Chief of the

Second Chief Directorate on a cable that. I had written

SHUBNYAKO: was absent at the time, I would take it to GRIBANOV

Though I was only a junior

case officer at the

tine, I would take the cable, after it had been approved by the

Chief of Section and the Chief of Department, directly to GRIBAROV,

who would simply sign it with

no discussion.

I do not cerember hor

many times I

took cables to GRIBANOV nor do I remenber the contents

of any specific one of them. The first meeting with GRIBANOV

that

I specifically remember was in the summer of 1956.

I think it was

in June.

I had returned from Kiev with KOZLOV and, after writing

a spravka on BURGI, PERFILYEV, KOZLOV, and I went to see GRIBArOV.

KOZLOV didn't introduce me to GRIBANOV at that time, but GRIBANOV

knew that I was NOSENKO because the plan for the BURGI operation

said that I would participate and because PERFILYEV had made an

appointment for the three of us to speak to GRISWUV at this time.

The meeting lasted about 30 or 40 minutes. GRIBANOV read the re-

port on BURGI's recruitment and asked some questions.

KOZLOV

answered some of these and I answered others.

Otter than asking

what Ukrainians took part in the operation, 1 ean recall none of

GRIBANOV's questions nor do I remember any

of the conversation

which took place at this meeting.

When we were through, KOZLOV

and I left while PERFILYEV remained with GRIBAYOV..

Perhaps the

first time I was alone with GRIBAYOV was in 1958 when I attended

a reception given by the

Indian Embassy at the Sovetskaya Hotel

in Moscow.

Usually (A.V.) SUNTSOV accompanied GRIBAVOV on such

occasions, but, he was sick at the time.

I don't knos why SUNTSOV

usually went with GRIBANOV, why I was selected to go, or what I

was supposed to do at the reception.

I think GRIBANOV called the

Seventh Department and asked whom

ne could use, but I don't know

why he picked

me.

GRIBANOV told me that, at the reception, I was

to refer to him as Aleksey Mikhaylovich GORBUNOV.

I was to

Introduce myself as Yuriy Ivanovich and if anybody asked, would use

the last nane NIKOLAYEV. Vera ANDREYEVA, who went with us, used

the name Vera Ivanna. After work, I went home to change my

clothes and we went in GRIBANOV's car from the KGB to the Hotel

Sovetskaya.

GRIBANOV sat in front with the driver and I sat in

back with Vera ANDREYEVA.

I cannot say how many times I have seen

GRIBANOV altogether.

From 1959 on 1 saw him more frequently.

Sometimes, GRIBANOV would call meetings of chiefs of sections and

their deputies and I would take part in these.

I had begun tc

call GRIBANOV by his first name and patronymic in 1958, when I

was Deputy Chief of the First Section of the Seventh Department,

but at these meetings I called him 'Comrade General.'

In 1959'

I also went to GRIBANOV's office alone in connection with the.

PRIPPEL case and, sometime-between llay and October 1959, took

him a report that I had prepared concerning the use of tourist

cover by foreign intelligence organizations."

23-24 February 1965 (from a protocol signed 26 February) :

had already spoken to CHELNOKOV, who was then Chief of the Seventh

Department, about this matter:

and he had suggested that I go to

GRIBANOV

finally agreed that I should

return to the Seventh Department as

Chief of the First Seccion with the

understanding that I

would be

appointed Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department is soon as this

position would be vacated by (a.A.] BALDI:.

In July 1962 I was

appointed Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

this recision

was made by CHELOKOV and GRIBANOV in

accordance with the intention

stated by GRIBANOV at the end of 1961 that I should be appinted

to this position as soon as possible. I had no further parsonal

di cussions with GRIBWOV about this appointment at this time.

In

1963 CHELNOKOV (GRIBANOV'S Deputy, I.D. I BOBKOV, and GRISANOV

decided that I should be named

First

Deputy. Chief of the seventh

Department.

they id not discuss this with me beforehand and no

order was issued about this appointment.

I was simply told that

from that time I would be considered as First Deputy Chief of the

Department.

At this time I was, in fact, the only Deputy Chief of

the Seventh Department, since KOROBOV did not come to the Saventh

Department until about

November or December 1963.

GRIBANOV did

not toll me his reasons for appointing me

Deputy Chief of the

First Section, First Department in January 1960,

for warting to

appoint ne Deputy Chief of the First Department in late 1961, or

for appointing me Section Chiet and later Deputy Chief of the

Seventh Department in 1962.

He did not discuss with me my personal

qualifications for each of these positions.

GRIBANOV had nothing

at all to do with my assignment to Geneva

in 1962.

I thirk that

the kharakteristika witten about me for this trip was signed by

BOBKOV,

since he was the Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Direc

torate who supervised the Seventh

Department.

I did not personally

discuss

this

trip with GRIBANOV before my departure from Moscow.

My candidacy for this assignment was supported by BANNIKOV, the

Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who

supervised the

work of the Eleventh Department which had the investigative file

On SHAKOV. BANNIKOV was concerned with the question of who would

go as case officer on this trip because SHAKOV, who was suspected

• of possibly being a western agent, was to be in the delegation.

There was no background or neighborhood investigation conducted

on me in connection with my being approved for this trip.

My

assignment was approved by the Eleventh Department, by the Person-

nel Office of the Second Chief Directorate, by the Central Personnel

Office of the KGB and by the Central Committee of the CrSU.

GRIPANOV

had absolutely nothing

to do with my assignment to Geneva in 1964.

The kharakteristika on me

for this trip was signed by BOBKOV. for

the I964 trip no decision of approval of the Central Comnittee of

the CPSU was required for me or for any of the other members of

the delegation who had been approved for the 1962 trip.

KHLOBU-

STOV, PANCHENKO, and KOVALENKO supported me for the assignment as

a personal favor to me. I did not discuss my 1964 trip to Geneva

with GRIBANOV prior to my departure.. In fact, I was even afraid

that GRISANOV would find out that I was going

and would object to

my making this second trip."

23: February 1965: NOSENKO commented further on his social

encounzers with GRIBAYOV and TAPARPIN.

The following, which was

not included in the protocol quoted above, is tarr. from case

officer notes.

Question: Teil me about the occasions when you were with GRIBANOV

and TARABRIN.

NOSENKO:

Three times--drinking in cafes.

Twice afterwards there

were girls.

The most recent time wan

in September or

October 1963.

I don't remember the firat time..

In

1963 I received a call from TARMiRI!! at home.

Then

GRIBANOV got on the phone and told me to take his car

and come join them

at the Praga Restaurant.

I didn't

take his car because I didn't want to call the duty-

officer.

I took a cab and vent to the Fraga.

They

were sitting there and drinking in a private room.

I

joined them.

They were drinking champagne, but I took

cognac.

ThRABRIN suggested girls about.

1230 and GRIBANOV

made

me go to the office to get my notebook. I called

one girl I knew-her and her sister.

When I got back

to the restaurant it was closed with only GRIBANOV and

TAPARRIN still there.

We lient to the girls' (apartment).

They weren't prostitutes exactly. I knew her before.

Question:

Is this why GRIBANOV called you to the restaurant (i.e..

to provide girls)?

NOSENKO:

I think so.

It was the second time I had participated

in this.

This last time CRIBANOV told the girl his

name.

The girl works in the Archives of the First Chief

Directorate.

At that time of night I rasn't able to

reach anyone else.

Iler name is Galina Mikhaylovna.

Her mother works in the Central Committee.

remember her last name.

GRIBAYOV was drinking and she

told him that she had quarreled with ZAYTSEV, the Chief

of the First Chief Directorate Archives.

told her that he would give her a job and told me to

arrange for a job in the American Department of the

Second Chief Directorate for her.

drove him

home at 0600 and he was in the office by 0830.

3 March 1965:

Speaking of the damage his disclosures must

have caused the KGB, NOSENKO said:

"I believe they will punish

people in the Second Chief Directorate (SCD]..•

Even GRIBANOV. • •

He was personally responsible, as head of the

SCD, for pushing

me ahead."

Question: What sort of punishment?.

NOSENKO: Even firing.

Question:

Do you think any others would be punished, or even

fired?

NOSENKO:

Maybe ROVALENKO, BOBROV, and people in the Eleventh

Department. Many others, too.

Later

in the same session the interrogator returned to this subject.

The following is a transcript of the discussion:

Question:

You said you trink GRIBANOV. might be fired.

Yet, there

is nothing in the protocol you signed (see abovel about

your relations with GRIBANOV which would seem to make

him personally responsible for you.

Is there something

else, something you haven't told me?

NOSENKO:

Question:

No.

Why then do you think GRIBANOV wouls be fired?

NOSENKO:

(no answer)

Question:

NOSENKO:

Don't know.

Question: Nell, what is your opinion at least?

NOSENKO:

Nothing, nothing. Let's not discuss this.

Question:

Why not?

NOSENKO:

It's simply my opinion, that's all. I dos't know why.

Question:

NOSENKO:

Well, what is your cpinior?

He was responsible for my becoming Deputy Chief of

Department.

Question:

But you had already gotten ahead before: you said he

didn't help you become Deputy Chief of Section in 1958.

NOSENKO: Yes.

Question: Did you ever hear any gossip about his help to you?

NOSENKO:

It was said in the SCD that he helped me become Chief

of Section and Deputy Chief of Department.

Question:

NOSENKO:

Why would BOBKOV be punished?

le was my supervisor, and in '61 he was Secretary o

ne KGB Party Organization

Question: Would others in the Party Organization be punished?

NOSENKO:

Yes, also in the Party Organization of the Seventh

Department and of the SCD.

Question:

• Would BANNIKOV be punished?

NOSENKO :

No.

He did nothing, just supported my candidature for

Geneva:

But why make you Deputy Chief of Department?

But it was not then, but in 1961, when he made you

NOSENKO:

- He was in an

inspection group of the Collegium, checking the Seventh

Department.

Presumably this is a reference to NOSENKO's contracting venereal
