been intended for, and levied on, ASLASH-I.

However, due to

the fact that ANTHIP-I was together in Europe with ALASH-l,

Regarding the

Venezuelan who has reportedly to have just come from Moscow

and returning to Cuba, AJWHIP-1 stated that he had no

information to contribute about the man.

He did say, however,

that one time during his recent trip to the Cuban Embassy

Paris talking with CUNSNAFU-19, the Ambassador had interrupted

their conversation in order to

talk to two men (about 30-35

years old).

ANWHIP-I met them briefly and was told by one

of them that they

from Oriente Province.

stated that he could

tell immediately by their accents

that they were not Cuban.

In order to confirm this he

asked them

where in Oriente they were from because one of the

Cuban officials in Paris was from Oriente and always wanted

any people from Oriente who passed through Paris.

After a brief stumbling exercise, groping for a name of a

City in Oriente,

the "Cuban" confessed that they were not

Cubans but Venezuelans.

ANWHIP did not have suffident time

to learn more about them.. The

two Venezuelans spent about

thirty minutes talking

with CUNSNAFU-19 while AWHIP was there.

He did not know how much longer previous to this thirty

minutes that the Venezuelans

had been in the Embassy or to whom

else they talked.

ANNHIP-l suggested that (UNSNAFU-9 might

be able to obtain the names

of the two Venezuelans in question.

which, of course, in the end he did not.

ANHIP-I stated that

AMLASH felt that he had been pushed by

the Americans into

basically unwanted relationship with AJBIDDY-l.

ANWHIP-1 stated

that he, as well as AHLASH-l were still baffled at the American

reluctance to deal

had to appeal to him for help in raising the money in a fatray

during his stay in Madrid; had fallen through, AWHIP had:

learned, thus the reason: for ASWHIP-2's being forced to go

to Paris in order to give it to him this weekend.

ANWHIP-1

also stated that ANLASH-I had asked Jose Iglestas in Havana

for some 3,000 pesos.

Iglesias was not able to raise the sum

at the time requested.

Whether of not he is attempting to do

so now, or has succeeded in doing so during ANLASH-l's absence,

I should be noted that during w

discussions concerning the ABIDDY/AMLASH relationship, AWHIP

stated

that ANBIDDY had told AMLASH of at least some portion of

his connections with the Americans. AWHIP-l stated that he had

made this statement.
