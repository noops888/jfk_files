MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING

00: DALLAS

Re San Francisco airtel and teletype to Bureau dated

2/24/67.

Enclosed for the Bureau are 10 copies of an LHM

regarding interviews of ROBERT LARGEN and HERBERT DURELL

MC CORD and resulting negative investigation to locate GLENN

DAVID ROACH.

Investigation at Fort Worth, Texas, and Dallas,

Texas, was conducted by SA GERALD LEWIS GEARY.

Investigation

at Sacramento, California, was conducted by SA PETER T.

SEXTON.

Inquiries regarding MC CORD with knowledgeable

police investigators indicate he is an associate of the major

criminal element in the Dallas metropolitan area and is

completely uncooperative with any police agency. It would

appear that MC CORD purposely furnished false information

regarding D. G. ROACH, aka "Tex" Roach, believed identical to

GLENN DAVID ROACH, as he was unavailable for interview in the

Dallas area.
