On September 23, 1961, BERNARDO LLERENA COBOS,

221 Northwest 33rd Avenue,

Miami, Florida, advised that

he had just arrived in the United States via a small boat

from Cuba, and that for approximately the past two years

he had been active in the underground movement in Cuba,

namely in the province of vistanzas.

He said that as of

that time he was a menber of the DRE, that he had come

to the United States to contact leaders of Cuban exiled

groups in Miami regarding assistance for the underground.

LLERENA stated that as of that tine there were no major

active underground organizations in Cuba,

DRE was stepping up its activity in the Matanzas Province

in conjunction with the operations of the Movimiento

Democrata Cristiano (Christian Democratic Movement)

(NDC). He said that the three most prominent organi-

zations in the underground in Cuba at that time were

the Movisiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (Revolutionary

Movement of the People) (MRP), the Movimiento 30 de

Noviembie (30th of Novenber Movement), and the MC.

LLEREN advised that he wished to emphasize

while these groups exist. in Cuba they are all small

numerically and their operacions are seriously impaired

is a well organized underground organization in Cuba:

with contacts throughout the island.

This source stated

for the escape of MM I-I through its underground apparatus.

On November 21, 1961, M4 I-2, who has not

furnished sufficient infonation to permit a determination

as to his reliability, but who stated that he was an

official of the DRE in Cuba, advised chat he left Cuba

In October, 1951, with the excaccation of returning in

who described himself as the Sacretary General of the

DRE and MM I-2, advised that the DRE is the traditional

Cuban students

organization which exists to combat

tyranny in Cuba. FERNANDEZ and MM I-2 said that 90 percent

of the membership of this organization is in Cuba, and

thai although the group suffered a severe setback with

the arrest of ALBERTO MULLER and 74 of his men in April,

the organizational structure of the DRE has been

naintained and was being revitalized.

They stated that

the DrE operates throughout the island and that its

basic scrength was that of the student membership,

although it also had representation from among Cuban

laboress, farmers and professional men. They said that

the group had underground cuntrol of the students in the

four universities of Cuba, including the University of

He mentioned that

the 1R2 in Cuba was using a plastic bag containing a

difficult to handleand that their detonators were old

He mantioned that the "CEL"' that they had

MENDOZA said that the persons

mentioned by GONZALEZ had already been arrested or had

fled from Cuba, He did state, however, that the arrests

by the Cuban G-2 of many of the MRP loaders had left

the organization in very serious condition and without

leadezship..

He said that while these was undoubtedly

a good nucleus of VRP members, the repressive measures

of the government had been of

such magnitude as to

seriously limit any future possibilities for reocganization

of the MRP in Cuba.

am exile fron Cuba since March,

1961. He said that prior

to that time he had operated as a guercilla in the

Escambray Mountains of las Villas Province with OSVALDO

RAMIREZ.

MONTIEL stated chat since his arrival in

still

lives in Las Villas Province near the Escambray.

in these letters, by use of a prearranged code,

she has

been furnishing him with sone infornation as to the

status of RAMIRIZ and the ocher guerrilla groups in the

MONTIDL advised that he had received a letter

about ten days ago in which his wife indicated that the

situation of the guerrilla fighters in the Escambray

is extremely precarious.

Many of the men have no more

then one or two bullets. for their guns while some have

no guns at all. The problem of obtaining adequate food

is becoming more difficult with the presence of greater

numbers of militia in the piains surrounding the Escambray

Mountains.

Because of the shortage of ammunition, the

activity of these men is confined solely to hit

run operations, always with the purpose of obtaining

some additional arms. and/or anmunition..

These actions

ars not causing any sreat difficulty fos the CASTRO

forces

and in reality are conducted only to permit the

people in the hills to continue their resistence.

Suitable ammunition is the thing most urgently

reeded by these men.

Their prime difficulty is due to

the

fact that many of them have weapons which have a

differenc caliber than the ans being used by the

militia, hence the guerrillas must seize both weapons

and matching ammunition fron the CASTRO forces in order

to strengthen themselves.

The numerical strength of the

militia and the weakness and lack of ammunition on the

part of the guezcillas makes such operations very

hazardous.

MONTIEL pointed out that the southern part

of the Escambray Mountains is less than two miles from

the south coast of Cuba, and is the most accessible

location for the landing of supplies and material needed

by the guerrillas.

MONTIEL stated that his wife has told him

that in and around Trinidad in las Villas Province, there

are many men who have made prepacations to go to the

Escambray at such time as the necessary arms and ammunition

become available.

mere is, however, a collective fear

in the minds of the anti-CASTRo people, and it is

becoming increasingly difficult to organize action

against the government forces when their chances of —

success are so limited.

varzous underground groups

in the cities, as well

as the farmers in the surrounding

territories are helping those in the mountains to some

extent with food, medicine and ammunition when available.

MONTIEL said that the people in Cuba are

hoping that some serious action will be started against

CASTRO by February or March of this year, since they

feel that this is the time that the CASTRO militia would

be most vulnerable.

Due to the sugar harvest starting:

in Esbruary, the militia, who last year were utilized

in this harvest,

will be scattered throughout the sugar

growing area and would not be in as good a posicion to

promptly met an appropriacely placed attack.

In addition,

bridges, roads, electrical plants and other strategic

Installations would probably be less well protected and

more vulnerable.

recent information, the forces of OSVALDO RAMIREZ

between 200 and 300.

Other smallei groups of guarcillas are reportedly

operating in the hills in various areas of Cuba, but

MONTIeL advised that he had had no direct contact with

them.

He said that a man called "CAMPTIO" is allegedly

still in the area near Coralillo in the northwest part

of Los Villas Province.

It is said thas "CAMPITO" is

in dire circumstances and relatively inactive.

MONTIEL also mentioned that a man named "CARA

LINDA" (Pretty lace) is said to be in the hills in pinar

del Rio Frovince with a saall group of man. A man called

"TITE" is said to be in the hills near San Cristobal

in Las Villas Province with a group which is operating

independently of "CARA LINDA".
