CONFIRMED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NUMBER OF SOVIETS IN CUBA,

SOME ARE LEAVING BUT SOME ARE ALSO ARRIVING, SOURCE IS NOT AWARE
OF ANY SOVIET INFANTRY OR ARMORED COMBAT UNITS. PRESENTLY IN CUBA.
HE STATED THAT ANY UNITS WHICH MAY HAVE FITTED THIS CATEGORY LEFT

WITH THE IRBM'S IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 1962. HE IS CERTAIN THAT
ALL IRBM'S AND BOMBERS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT.)

2. CASTRO CONTINUES TO BE UNHAPPY WITH THE SOVIETS AND WILL
NEVER FORGET THE TREATMENT HE RECEIVED FROM THEM IN THE PALL OF 1962.

CASTRO IS MUCH CLOSER TO THE CHINESE LINE BUT REALIZES HE CANNOT i
EXIST WITHOUT SOVIET AID. HE INSISTS THAT THE CUBANS BE TRAINED i
AND ASSUME CONTROL OF ALL SOVIET EQUIPMENT IN CUBA. BECAUSE CASTRO

BECOMES ENRAGED OVER BEING CALLED ANYONE'S STOOGE AND FEELS SO
STRONGLY AND PROUD OF THE INDEPENDENT POSITION HE HAS TAKEN, SUCH '
AS NOT AUTHORIZING GROUND INSPECTION AND NOT SIGNING THE PARTIAL

TEST BAN TREATY, IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE WILL INSIST THAT THE SOVIETS '
LEAVE WHEN THE CUBANS ARE TRAINED AND CAN HANDLE THE EQUIPM=”.T. A
3. MIG-19 PILOTS HAVE BEEN TRAINED | IN BOTH THE SOVIET UNION

AND CHINA, SOME, SUCH aa PRENDES’ AND" VE “VERONITA™ “(sTo), RECEIVED

MIG-21 TRAINING EARLY IN cpa AND MORE PILOTS ARE PRESENTLY TRAINING

IN CUBA. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: PRENDES IS PROBABLY CAPTAIN ALVARO

PRENDES QUINTANA; VERONITA IS POSSIBLY IDENTICAL WITH CAPTAIN ENRIQUE

VARONA,) THE MIG-21'S ARE CONTROLLED BY THE CUBANS, BUT THE SOVIETS
REMAIN AS ADVISERS.
