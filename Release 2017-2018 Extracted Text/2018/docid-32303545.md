LEAD
PITTSBURGH

AT PITTSBURGH, PA. (ALLEGHENY COUNTY

Will continue to follow and report activities
of subject and his associates in accordance with Bureau
instructions.

ADMINISTRATIVE

While the period of this report is slightly longer
than desirable, it is entirely due to an almost complete lack
of activity on the part of subject.

It is noted that it has been reported previously
that the MANNARINOs were alleged to have a contact in the
Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D. C., who could see
to it that certain contractors got the contracts to build
on reservations. By relet, iB /eT, Cleveland Division advised:

On April 14, 1967, CV 646-C was recontacted, and
he advised he had been unable to ascertain name of contact
of MANNARINO brothers, employed by the Bureau of Indiana
Affairs. Informant advised he has been recently contacted
by JOSEPH "RED" GIORDANO, "go-between" man for the MANNARINO
prothers, and advised there is another construction project
coming up for bid on an Indians Reservation, somewhere in the
State of Arkansas, and GIORDANO advised informant that he
will recéive the plans for this work in the near future.
Informant stated hedoes not. know any further details at this
time, but stated the job will be for between one and two
million dollars, and after he has had a chance to study the
plans and before making his bid, Unknown Subject, employed
by the Bureau of Indiana Affairs, is allegedly coming to Youngs-
town at which time he will discuss the Job with informant.

cv 646-C advised that GIORDANO is the "go-between"
between he and the MANNARINO brothers, and also between
the MANNARINO brothers and the Unknown Subject employed by
the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

-B-

DocId:32303545 Page 3



PG 92-228
cv 646-c stated that GIORDANO continues to frequent

the Town and Country Motel, with restaurant and bar, Route 422,

Warren, Qhio. He stated GIORDANO has moved into the Warren
area, as apparently ANTHONS¥YDELSANTER has been unable to
handle racket matters satisfactorily in the Warren area.
Informmt stated no doubt it was DELSANTER who hélped GIORDANO
locate a home in the area, where he currently resides.

cv 646-c stated that just recently he was desirous
of locating GIORDANO and was unable to do so in the Warren
area, stated "I had to call way over to New Kensington (Pa.)
to get the number," and furnished Warren.phone 898-4741,
an unlisted number, as the residence of GIORDANO.

On April 14, 1967, it was determined that Warren

phone 898-4741 is an unlisted phone in the name of ARTHUR
ff masks, 2620 Risher, S. W., Warren, Ohio, a residence.

cv 646-c was recontacted on April 14, 1967, and
he advised that he does not know the name of ARTHUR MARKS,
put this was the. telephone number he received as the home
phone of GIORDANO.

The Warren City and Telephone Directories and
the Haines Youngstown-Warren City and Suburban addressakey-
telokey directory failed to list either the name of ARTHUR
MARKS or the address of 2620. Risher, S. W., Waren.

It is again to be noted that this is extremely
sensitive information, and it would still appear that no.
active inquiry be made in Washington so that the informant
will not be placed in a compromising position. Continued
contacts will be made with the informant, and when positive
information is developed, the Bureau and the Pittsburgh
offices will be advised.

Will continue to follow and report activities

instructions.

ADMINISTRATIVE

i While the period of this report is slightly
longer than desirable, it 1s attributable to an almost
total lack of activity on the part of the subject
and preoccupation ofthe preparing Special Agent with
other, more pressing, matters in connection with the
Criminal Intelligence Program.

oe

By réairtel dated 1/20/67, it was set out
that CV 646-cC advised on 1/12/67, that on 1/10/67,
he had a meeting at the Town & Country Motel, Restaurant,
Route 422, Warren, Ohio, with JOSEPH "RED" GIORDANO
and JACK VEACH, of New Kensington, Pa. Informant
stated that when he arrived, ANTHONY DELSANTER got up
from the table and left, apparently having spent some
time talking with GIORDANO and VEACH, Idformant
was questioned as to the identity of JACK VEACH, and
he stated VEACH operates a drug store for the MANNARINO
brothers in New Kensington, Pa., and does some "leg
work" for them from time to time.

cv 646-c advised that the purpose of the
meeting was to discuss some proposed construction
with GIORDANO and VEACH. He stated he had received a
call from SAM MANNARINO just before, and rather than
MANNARINO come to Ohio to discuss same, he sent ee
and VEACH.

Informant stated that the MANNARINO brothers
apparently have a "real good connection" with someone
in the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D. C,
He stated there is a "complex" to be constructed in the
heart of the Navajo Reservation at Many Farms, Arizona,
which may cost as much as 15 million dollars. He stated
that when he was telephonically contacted by MANNARINO,

COVER PAGE

DoclId:32303545 Page 7



PG 92-228

MANNARINO asked him whether or not he might be
interested in. the construction as a general contractor,
and he advised him that he might, but when he heard

q he would have to make his bid by 1/19/67, he told
MANNARINO that this was not sufficient time for him

to get his bid together, and MANNARINO ‘told him at the
time that the bidding period would be extended to
1/26/67. AN i

On 1/16/67, CV 646-C advised he had received |
an "invitation.to bid," by certified mail from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, and at that time it was noted

_ that the bidding period had been extended until 1/26/67,
and the name of his company and his name had been
inserted on the list of general contractors who had been
invited to bid, He stated his company was the only
company east @& the Mississippi River who had been
invited to bid. Informant was questioned as to what
MANNARINO would be able to do for him should he be
interested in bidding, and he advised that should he {
desire to bid, although he does not think he will
place a bid for the construction, he would?fill in all
of the information on the forms, except the total
amount of his bid. Then.on the day the bids are opened
in Washington, D, C., after all the bids were open,
he would receive a phone call and would be told the
amount of the lowest bid. At this time he would have
to make his final decision as tovwhether or not he wished
to bid for an amount, a few thousand dollars lower than
the lowest bidder, and the person, name unknown to

ee the informant, would then write in informant's bid

on the form, and he would be awarded the bid on the

basis of he being the lowest bidder.

Informant was questioned further as to the
construction and he advised that the current plan is
to construct a high school and a residence "complex" :
of about 134 buildings, each containing four apartments.
He was questioned as to what amount of money would be
involved. in a payment to the MANNARINOs for their getting
the bid for him, and he advised as follows: He stated .
that if the lowest bidder was a legitimate bidder who
had thoroughly checked out all costs of the construction,
then the job should wmalize a net of five per cent; of

~C~
COVER PAGE

\

DocId:32303545 Page 8



PG 92-228

this five per cent he would probably be required

to give the MANNARINOs a total of about three per

cent; this three per cent would be paid "legitimately"
by check to various individaats for consulting feés,
salaries, etc. Informant was questioned as to anything
in addition to obtaining the contract that the
MANNARINOs would be.doing for him, and he advised he
would be orally guaranteed no labor problems, and

a limited number of inspections by the architects

anfYor government-inspectors.

CV 646-C stated he does not think he would
go through with the "deal" and make a bid as he feels
that. this type of "deal" is too risky and that the
only persons to gain are the MANNARINOs, and should
he, himself, suffer a loss, they would not reimburse
him.

Informant was questioned as to any further

obligations he would have with the MANNARINOs supposing ‘

he would enter into the contract, and wouktimake éven
more than the net of five per cent, and\he advised

he would have nothing further, and ‘would ‘only/have to
abide by the terms of the "contract" with the MANNARINOs
for this particular job,

At the time informant was questioned as to
any friendship between the MANNARINOs and/or GIORDANO,
with DOMINICK MALLAMO of Youngstown, and he advised

that when he arrived at the Town&County Motel on 1/10/67,

and before they entered into a discussion about the
"contact," GIORDANO inquired of informant as. to the
health of MALLAMO, and wanted informant to make certain

that he carried GIORDANO's personal greetings to MALLAMO,

In view of this, informant stated he knows there is
close friendship among the group.

By relet dated 1/31/67, it was set out that
on 1/24/67, Cleveland opened file 46-3365, entitled,
"UNSUB - Employee, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington,
D. C.; GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka; SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka,
Fraud Against the Government." :

The only action being taken at this point is
to,recontact the informant for additional details con-

cerning this matter. This is extremely sensitive
information, and it would appear at the present should
active inquiry be made in Washington that the informant
could be pkeed in a compromising condition. In re-
contacts with.the informant, efforts will be made to
obtain further indication which might be used to
further conceal the informant's involvement.
