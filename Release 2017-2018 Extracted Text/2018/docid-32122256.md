He furnished information to SA JOHN I. PRYOR and SA BENNY J.

CANNY on 2/5/64, and to SA JOHN I. PRYOR On 2/6/64.

Tie copfEsof LHM has been furnished Secret Service

and the Treasury Department locally, due to their interests

in racial matters involving possible violence and the illegal

possession of automatic weapons.

HUNTER was taken into custody by the Cincinnati

Police Department on 2/4/64, at which time he was to be

charged with Grand Larceny.

Rather than charge HUNTER with

Grand Larceny, the Police Department offered him an

opportunity to become an informant. HUNTER accepted this

opportunity, and among the information he furnished was

information concerning the guns as contained in this LHM.

HUNTER made it crystal clear that if information

concerning these guns got back to CLIFF PRINCE, Lewis

-Road, Amelia, Ohio, HUNTER might be "taken care of"' by friends

of PRINCE in Newport, Kentucky.

HUNTER stated PRINCE is engaged as a "fence" and

he believes PRINCE is capable of taking care of him

fatally in the event information concerning these guns

is returned to PRINCE.

HUNTER, as an informant for the Police Department,

is making efforts to locate these reported weapons.

We are

maintaining close liaison with the Police Department in

connection with this matter to insure protection of Bureau

interests and to determine if there is any violation within

our jurisdiction.

Cincinnati has no concrete information that any

automatic weapons are presently located in the Cincinnati

territory to be used by racial organizations.

Bureau will be kept advised of any pertinent information.
