HUNTER was taken into custody by the Cincinnati
Police Department on 2/4/64, at which time he was to be
éharged with Grand Larceny. Rather than charge HUNTER with
Grand Larceny, the Police Department offered him an
opportunity to become an informant. HUNTER accepted this
opportunity, and among the information he furnished was
information concerning the guns as contained in this LHM.

. -..\y HUNTER made it crystal clear that if information
_ -eoncerning these guns got back to CLIFF PRINCE, Lewis :
“Road, Amelia, Ohio, HUNTER might be “taken care of" by friends
of PRINCE in Newport, Kentucky.

HUNTER stated PRINCE is engaged as a "fence" and
he believes PRINCE is. capable of taking care of him
fatally in the event information concerning these guns
is returned to PRINCE. : .

. HUNTER, as an informant for the Police Department,
.is making efforts to locate these reported weapons. We are
maintaining close liaison with the Police Department in
connection with this matter to insure protection of Bureau
interests and to determine if there is any violation within
our jurisdiction.

Cincinnati has no concrete information that any
automatic weapons are presently located in the Cincinnati
territory to be used by racial organizations...

Bureau will be kept advised of any pertinent information.
