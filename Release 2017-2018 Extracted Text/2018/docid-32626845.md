mo of most difficult problems facing Adoula and COC is continuing

psychological handicap they face in virtual freedon of air enjoyed by

Jatanga Air Force In Forth Katanga. Fron recent conversations with UN

officials re bombing missions of TAF la Forth Katanga and need to re-

establish credibility of INDG air capablilty, we know they are concarned

over this problen and are anxious to find practicable solution within UN

mandate. After carefal consideration, te have concluded that following esurse

of action is appropriate under circumstances.

Accordingly, request you disouse course of action with U Thant of

Bunche in context above and on baste me are in effect responding to informal

UN request for advice.

only way of meeting problen of neutrallzing KAf, without giving 000

«{footive and Independent air force, is to use JIDC planes against Katangan

Planes. Te recognise difficulty, siren vast area to be covered and limited

number UN plarea, of intercepting fatangan aireraft in flight. Aecordingly,

beat nethod assuring they are put out of comission is probably to strafe

then on ground. As ve see it, there are two major elements to be considered

1n such action: 1) adequate justification; 2) advance notification.
