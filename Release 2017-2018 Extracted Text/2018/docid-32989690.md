SUBJECT: INTERVIEW BY MESSRS. RICHARD VSRMEIRE on
AND TIMOTHY OLIPHANT OF PIKE COMMITTEE Tolpone Ros —

Director Sec'y —

polo PM TO 5:05 PM, NOVEMBER 25, 1975

Messrs. Richard Vermeire and Timothy Oliphant representing the Pike
Committee called at my office at 3:10 P.M. today and departed at 5:05 P.M. They
commenced their interview by asking for a general run down on how procurement is
handled within the FBI. In general, I explained that we adhered to the Federal
procurement regulations. They asked for a copy of these regulations and I advised
them that this would be furnished to them. I also advised as to the delegation of
authority by the Attorney General to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration
and the redelegation of his authority to the Director to enter into contracts with certain
limitations. I explained that the Director had redelegated his authority in accordance
with regulations to certain named Bureau officials, including myself, and that I was
generally responsible to serve as the Bureau contract officer. They asked what the
biggest contract was that I. had ever administered and I advised them that it woul ae
the FINDER contract amounting to just under 5 million dollars. They did not wi cand
the difference between procurement authority and authority to enter into ote sgand
although reference was made to procurements they did not pursue this and eventually
centered on contracts with U. S. Recording Company. In response to their specific
questions, I advised that I was not acquainted with Mr. Tate, President of U. S.
Recording and I had never met him. They wanted to know whether Iwas aware of any
specific documents which would show the origin of the Bureau's relationship with U. S.
Recording and I responded that I knew of none. They asked how the Bureau would
select an individual or a firm to whom a confidential contract would be awarded. I
answered that it appeared to me this would be based upon experience, prior relationship
which demonstrated ability to act responsibly in connection with a confidential contract,
experience within the intelligence community and the like. I advised there were no
written guidelines to this effect but that was my own feeling as to how a confidential
relationship was developed. As to confidential contracts which I had signed as Contract-
ing Officer, I advised that I recalled only one contract where I was the Contracting
Officer with U. S. Recording and that was a contract executed in June, 1975, in the
amount of approximately $168,000. They asked how I went about entering into this
contract and I responded that I observed the Federal procurement regulations and the
guidelines of the Department of Justice and that the contract had been personally approved
by the Attorney General. They did not ask and I tt furnish them m any info information
as to, the subject matter of the contract. br 2 amffe be “ET 7 ry S95

Re: Interview by Messrs. Richard Vermeire

3:10 PM to 5:05 PM, 11-25-75

They then entered into a discussion as to my recollection of who preceded
me as Assistant Director of the Administrative Division and I advised them that I
had been preceded by N. P. Callahan, who in turn had been preceded by John P. Mohr
and before him Mr. Glavin. They asked about Mr. Mohr's other positions in the Bureau
and when I responded that he had been Assistant to the Director (Administrative) prior
to his retirement, one of them interjected a comment to the effect that wasn't Mr. Mohr |
an Administrative Assistant to Mr. Tolson at one time and I acknowledged that this was
so. He wanted to know as to my relationship with Mr. Mohr and I advised that I had
never been to his home nor he to mine with one exception and that was the occasion of
Mr. Mohr's daughter's wedding when I did briefly visit Mr. Mohr's home. They asked
whether I had seen any of the gifts that had been given Mr. Mohr upon his retirement
and they particularly mentioned two gold-plated 38 caliber revolvers fashioned into
bookends. I stated I had no recollection of ever having seen these bookends. They then
asked whether we in the FBI customarily gave departing officials gifts. I responded
that departing Assistant Directors and above were presented with their badges suitably
mounted, a retirement plaque (which I described) and gold cuff links, the latter being
the gift of their colleagues. They asked as to other retirement gifts that might be given
to departing officials and what part I might have played in that type of thing. I stated
that there was a custom in the Administrative Division and I thought quite generally in
other divisions that on the last day of a retiring employee's service we would have a
coffee and cake gathering in a suitable room within a division, covering the last two
hours of the working day, at which time friends and associates would call, some of whom
would present little departing gifts. They wanted to know what I did personally about
this and I said I would present the book of letters to the departing employee and that
it was customary to give the retiring employee a gift from his colleagues, which in my
division amounted to something purchased on the basis of a voluntary contribution from
the Agent colleagues in the division amounting to approximately $1.00 a man. This
would enable us to buy something like a camera, binoculars, miniature radio or some-
thing of that type and in my judgment this is what we all wanted to do on the occasion of
a retirement and it was a rather spontaneous and enthusiastic thing and I felt all shared
in my judgment that this was a fine thing to do. They wanted to know what gifts
Mr. Mohr was given upon his retirement. I advised I couldn't really recall any specific
gifts hehad received and I knew nothing about the pistoBto which reference is made above.

They then took the tack of inquiring about how close current Bureau officials
are with Mr. Mohr. I stated I really could not respond to that. I did know that he had
an acquaintanceship with current and past officials, but to what extent’ I could not say.
They wanted to know if I had ever played poker at a lodge outside of Harpers Ferry,
West Virginia (which incidentally they indicated burned to the ground last week). I
responded that I had not and that I had turned down two or three invitations to play. They

wanted to know why I ¢urned down these invitations and T responded that Mr. Mohr

Re: Interview by Messrs. Richard Vermeire

3:10 PM to 5:05 PM, 11-25-75

had asked me on two or three occasions to substitute for the regular card players
knowing that I had formerly played a lot of poker and that the only reason I declined
was frankly that my wife was not in favor of my staying away from home to play cards
and I felt that she is entirely right in this regard. They wanted to know who all
participated in these card games and I advised that I just did not know who all played.
They wanted to know what the financial arrangements were and I stated the only thing
that I knew was what Mr. Mohr told me on one occasion when he asked me to substitute
and that was that each one payed $25.00, which covered the room and food for an over-
night stay at the lodge, usually on a Friday night and extending into Saturday morning.
They wanted to know if Mr. Tate was in attendance at these card games and I stated

I did not know.

They then wanted to know whether we had any regulations dealing with conflict
of interest or the acceptance of gratuities. I stated that we followed Executive Order
11222, dated 5-8-65, and departmental regulations as published in the Federal Register.
I furnished them copies of these documents. They wanted to know whether from my own
standpoint I thought it was ever proper to accept any type of gratuity from a per son or
firm with which the FBI did business. I stated that I felt any type of gratuity would
be improper and that I personally had never accepted as much as a cup of coffee from
anyone with whom the FBI is doing business. Oliphant hastened to inject the comment
that E was not to read any implication into their question as they certainly had no
intention of suggesting that I had accepted any gratuities from anybody. They pressed
me as to whether there would be any exception to this and I indicated that the exception
was laid out in the Executive Order regarding food and beverage under certain limited
circumstances. They wanted to know who paid the expenses when Bureau officials took
trips in connection with the awarding of contracts. They were advised that Bureau
officials would be considered and properly so to be in an official duty status and per
diem was paid in accordance with standard Government travel regulations. They wanted
to know if there was such a thing as a higher rate of per diem for officials and I explained
that there was and outlined the controls we have governing the payment of the higher
rate of per diem.

They then went back to the subject of purchases and contracts with U. 8S.
Recording and wanted to know who determined whether the mark-up on such purchases
was reasonable. I responded that as far as I was concerned the determination of
reasonableness was based upon the judgment of Laboratory Division experts who were
aware of the going price for specific items, particularly in the electronics field and
it was my understanding that we were talking about a mark-up that generally would not
exceed 15% and probably would be less. They wanted to know whether I had ever
audited the books of U. S. Recording or had such an audit conducted so as to determine

Memorandum for Mr. Jenkins

Re: Interview by Messrs. Richard Vermeire
and Timothy Oliphant of Pike Committee
3:10 PM to 5:05 PM, 11-25-75

what the mark-up was. I responded that I had not and in response to their further
questioning indicated that as Contracting Officer in the one contract where I acted as
such J relied on the judgment of Laboratory Division experts that the price was
reasonable. They asked whether I had ever made a survey to determine the history
of the development of our relationship with U. S. Recording. I stated that I had not.
I asked them whether they were addressing this type of inquiry to anyone else within
the Bureau and they responded that they were and were asking for available documentatia

They returned to the subject of Mr. Mohr's current relationship with Bureau
officials and I responded that I knew Mr. Mohr had an acquaintanceship with some
Bureau officials and to what extent I just was not in a position to say. They wanted to
know whether I had ever visited in Mr. Callahan's home and he in mine. I replied that
we had not visited in each others’ homes and that our social relationship wasprincipally
through our attendance at dinners and other functions where we were both invitees but
that I considered Mr. Callahan as both a friend and associate and I thought his feelings
towards me were the same.

I took the occasion to comment to Messrs. Vermeire and Oliphant that I
definitely did not appreciate the comments made by their Chief Counsel Mr. Searle
when I testified in open hearingsbefore the Pike Committee to the effect that the FBI had
engaged in delaying tactics and were uncooperative in furnishing information requested
by the Committee. I pointed out that at that particular time the Pike Committee requests
pertained to the Bureau's budgetary process for which I was responsible and that as they
well knew my staff and I worked long hours overtime and through the weekend in order
to give timely responses to their inquiries within the very short deadlines they imposed
upon us. They expressed their appreciation for our efforts and stated that Searle's
expressed opinions did not represent their own.

RECOMMENDATION:
None. The foregoing is submitted to record the interview. As I did not take

notes during theAnterview, the above was dictated from recollection immediately upon
the departur Messrs. Vermeire and Oliphant.

On the early morning of November 19, 1975, eae an
number 488-3900, telephonically advised me ‘that he has been requested
to appear for a staff interview under oath by representatives of the House
Select Committee on November 20, 1975. Mr. Tait said that he was advised
by the staff to have a lawyer with him at the interview. He said he did not
know the reason for such advice, but intended to attempt to engage counsel
to be present with him on November 20, 1975. He said that he intended to
employ James Gale and he asked me whether the FBI would have any
objection to such an arrangement in view of the fact that Mr. Gale
formerly was an Assistant Director of the FBI. Itold Mr. Tait that
it was my understanding that Mr. Gale was presently practicing law and
that I saw no reason for the FBI to interpose an objection should Mr. Tait

desire to engage Mr. Gale as his counsel for whatever reason. a

Mr. Tait asked me if I had any advice for him. I responded
should he engage counsel my advice would be to discuss the matters which
may arise in the interview with his attorney and to be guided by his attorney's
advice. I told Mr. Tait that requests for staff interviews called for a
[rotting appearance for the witness unless a subpoena has been issued.
He said that he has not received a subpoena, but only a request.

At 10:05 a.m., November 19, 1975, former Assistant Director
James Gale called my office and in my absence he advised that Joe Tait
had been in touch with him concerning Tait's request for legal counsel
in connection with his appearance before the Pike Committee. Mr. Gale
expressed some concern that if he were to represent Mr. Tait, the
Committee staff could learn that he was formerly associated with the FBI

Kelley, Congressman Otis G. Pike, Chairman of the House Select

case involved a U. S. citizen, Kenneth R, Tolliver, who was
employed by Senator Eastland's office during 1968 and who later
admitted to the FBI that he furnished sensitive information to

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Allegations of Soviet
Penetrations on Capitol Hill

We know of no other "American citizens and foreign
nationals" who may have improperly passed sensitive information
to Soviet-bloc intelligence agents without prior FBI knowledge.
Congressional staff members regularly volunteer to the FBI
facts regarding their contacts with Soviet-bloc officials and
other persons who appear suspicious and who.have an undue interest
in sensitive material. Soviet-bloc officials often make efforts
to recruit sources and influential contacts on Capitol Hill
through whom they may obtain sensitive information, When the FBI
learns of such instances it advises the appropriate Congressman
and, if he has no objection, the FBI may interview the staff
member or, in some instances, consider utilization of him in an
operation, controlledby the FBI, aimed at determining the reason
for the individual's interest. These operations are undertaken
between the FBI and the Congressman or staff member with an un-
derstanding of confidentiality and sometimes involve sensitive
sources and methods, To furnish such information to the House
Committee, it is felt, will not only violate the understanding
of confidentiality the FBI has had with the Congressman and
staff members involved, but may also jeopardize the sensitive
sources and méthods which were utilized in some of these cases,
and have a detrimental effect on our future ability to fulfill
our foreign counterintelligence responsibilities.

The attached letter to Congressman Pike, therefore,
advises that for the reasons listed above, the FBI cannot fur-
nish the House Committee with information regarding these
individuals who confidentially volunteer to cooperate with the
FBI.

A copy of Congressman'Pike's letter to Mr. Michael
Shaheen, Jr., is attached for information.

Bf USE SELECT COMMITTEE

At 3:29 p.m. on November 19, 1975, John P. Mohr, former
Assistant to the Director, telephonically advised me that he had just
concluded an interview conducted by Richard Vermeire and Tim Oliphant
of captioned committee staff. He said he was not under oath and the
interview was not recorded, He was asked concerning the U.S. Recording
Company arrangements with the FBI for the purchase of electronic
Surveillance equipment. He said he told them that a former Assistant
Director of the FBI Laboratory, Ed Coffey, apparently had previously
made arrangements with U.S. Recording Company for the confidential
} purchase of electronic surveillance equipment in behalf of the FBI and

when Mohr became the Assistant Director of the Administrative Division
he simply continued such arrangements, He said he knows of no specific il
decisions that were made to buy through Tait. +

iy

Mohr approved memoranda to the Attorney General from time to
time requesting authorization to make purchases of’equipment when the 7
amounts involved were of such size as to require Departmental authorization, .°
but he did not see or sign written purchase orders made through the U.S.
Recording Company. He said that he was aware that Tait had treated nw
Bureau purciiases as confidential and in the past Tait has not divulged
Bureau interests. *eleetronic surveillance

He said that Tait's usual fee for handling purchases was a 10 to
15% mark-up plus a reasonable labor charge in cases where modification
of equipment was necessary. He was asked whether Tait was paid as a
confidential source of the Bureau. Mohr first denied that, but then considered,

Re; U.S. Recording Company

the fact that Tait's company was used as a "cut out" and that the fee paid to
Tait for such service could have bern considered payments made to 4
confidential source for services rendered. He was asked whether Tait had
charged a 30% mark-up as alleged by Martin Kaiser. Mohr said he was
not aware of instances involving a 30% mark-up and if such occurred it
would have been in excess of the usual fee paid to Tait,

Mr. Mohr said that he was confronted by Vermeire and Oliphant
with statements allegedly made by William Harward of the Laboratory
which seemed to imply that the Laboratory referred the requests to
purchase equipment to the Administrative Division and that Mohr authorized
purchases through U.S. Recording. Mr. Mohr indicated that the arrange-
ments for purchasing through U.S. Recording were based on Laboratory
Bivision requests and not on Administrative Division or his own réquests.
He commentéd that in regard to testimony by Martin Kaiser, it appeared
that the FBI Laboratory had made arrangements to purchase material
confidentially through U.S. Recording Company and then went directly
to the Martin Kaiser Company, specifying the purchase order requests,
and thereby revealing the FBI as a purchaser from Kaiser. He said that
such direct contact by the Laboratory made the arrangements with
U.S. Recording Company appear to be unnecessary and difficult to explain.

Mr. Mohr said that they did not indicate to him whether he would be
called as a witness before the Committee.

U. 8S, HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC)

RE: REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
CONCERNING COINTELPROS

62-116464

During September, 1975, staff members of the HSC were
permitted to review files relating to: this Bureau's discontinued
Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros), By memorandum dated
October 6, 1975, this Bureau responded to: a request of the HSC for-
delivery of certain Cointelpro documents, and these were actually
delivered to the Committee on October 7, 1975.

Among the material delivered to the Committee on
October 7, 1975, was an FBI communication dated September 29,
1970, which indicated authorization was being requested to implement
a Cointelpro action against one Mr. James Edward Keenan,

This Bureau is in receipt of a copy of a letter dated
October 16, 1975, directed to the Deputy Attorney General from one
James Edward Keenan of Durham, North Carolina, In his letter,
Mr. Keenan states, "I was informed by a staff member of the House
Select Committee on Intelligence on October 15, 1975, that during the
year of 1970 I was the victim of certain activities of an FBI group
known as Cointelpro," and requests he be provided with records of
this Bureau pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information
Act.

Review of the files of this Bureau has determined the above a

cating further correspondence rélating to this or any other Cointelpro

SUBJECT: STIMONY BY BUREAU OFFICIALS BEFORE

Q7HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
NOVEMBER 18, 1975 Divector Soe"y —

Departmental Attorney Edward Christenbury will
accompany Bureau officials when captioned testimony is
given.

In discussion between Mr. Christenbury and
representatives of the Legal Counsel Division, the
following responses and guidance to possible questions were
suggested: 9)

This testimony will particulary concern our f
investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a cutrené
investigation, and our investigation of Institute for
Policy Studies, a closed investigation. QuéStions may
develop in these matters which concern other current
investigations. We should explain that we are testify.
ing publicly concerning the current investigation of
SWP because many of the details of this investigation
including our basis for it are already on the public
record in a civil suit brought by SWP. If, however,
questions are asked concerning other current investigations
we should request that these be answered in Executive
Session.

We should also request Executive Session if
questions are asked concerning particular named *
individuals who are plaintiffs in the civil suit or
concerning third parties. This request would arise
from our desire to protect : insofar as possible the
confidentiality of our investigations of named

individuals and from our desire to protect the
privacy of third parties. REGAL ( A. - Mod's oy

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Testimony by Bureau Officials before
House Select Committee; 11/18/75

The question of electronic surveillance of
Peoples Coalition for Peace”and Justice (PCPJ) may
arise since this matter was touched upon by the
House Select Committee staff when they took deposi-
tions from SAs Terry O'Connor and Bill Tucker. We
should advise the Committee, if a question of this
nature is asked, that we have made a claim of
Executive Privilege on this information in the past
which was done in the civil suit brought by David
Dellinger. If pressed by the Committee in this regard,
it is suggested that Bureau officials state that they
will be glad to discuss the Committee's request with
the Attorney General and obtain his advice on what
information should be furnished the Committee concern-
ing any electronic surveillance of PCPJ.

Concerning requests for Executive Session
which is based on danger to national security, the
Committee will hear this type of information i:

Executive Session following a vote to do so byveGmnittee.
Rule 4.4 of the House Select Committee rules also

states that if the testimony to be given may tend to
defame, degrade, or incriminate any person that
testimony shall be received in Executive Session.

RECOMMENDATION :

None. For information.

In addition to these documents, the Committee has
requested any other memoranda on the same subject. A review
of our files revealed a seventh memorandum dated August 21,
1974 from Henry E. Petersen, Assistant Attorney General,
Criminal Division, to Director, FBI, captioned “American
Indian Movement." This memorandum refers to the possibility
that a Bureau informant may have obtained information con-
trary to Department instructions and in violation of the
right to counsel of the Wounded Knee defendants. This
matter was explained in your memorandum to the Assistant
Attorney General, Criminal Division, dated August 30, 1974.

Attached are copies of the seven Department memoranda.
It is our intention to furnish copies of these documents to
the Committee. It is requested that you advise whether or
not your Bureau has any objection to disclosure of these
documents.

‘this is in response to your memorandum to the Atto
General of April 9, 1974, captioned as above. You refer to \
the American Indian Movement Natiorlal Convention which according
to conflicting accounts is scheduled for either June 6-8, 1974,
at Fort Yates on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota -
or June 8-16, 1974, near Mobridge, South Dakota also on the
Standing Rock Reservation which extends over portions of both
states, You have also note
of AIM is scheduled fdr May 25-27 at Cumberland, Wisconsin,
and that national AIM leader Russell Means has stated that
after the AIM National Convention AIM members will travel to
the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana -_ stop the strip-

: Reference is also made to the memorandum from the
Deputy Attorney General to the Director, Federal Bureau of
Investigation dated November 21, 1972 concerning the American
Indian Movement in which it was stated that: "I request that
the Bureau intensify its'efforts in identifying violence-prone
individuals or organizations within the American Indian movement
(sic) who may be planning future violent demonstrations or
eximinal activities", :

The instructions -in this reférenced memorandum are
still in effect. However, because of the extreme likelihood a
that large numbers of persons under indictment for offenses if
committed at Wounded Knee and their attorneys will be present
at these upcoming events, and because of the possibility that a
a court could feel that the use of informants under these

clireumstances might violate the defendants right to consult

confiden
tion of
Sarye

ally with their attorneys, neither active investiga-
M nor the use of informants at these events are neces-

- :

In addition,’no informants are to be used at any time

or place where they might violate the right .of a person under
| indictment to consult confidentially with his attorney.

Shovld actual Federal criminal offenses be reported
during ‘any of these activities, it is requested that the FBI
immediately advise the appropriate United States Attorneys
Office, and. take such action as would.be taken if the offenses

_ had occurred at a time other than during one of these special
events. It is also requested that. the FBI immediately advise
the Criminal Division of any offenses that are reported- during
these events, :

This recommends the attached letter be sent to fA
the House Select Committee on Intelligence in response to

their request of 10/22775. Pere

By letter dated 10/22/75, addressed to FBI Director
Clarence M. Kelley, House Select Committee Counsel, Aaron B.
Donner, requested information regarding statements by Senator
Barry Goldwater to the effect that “Russian spies have
infiltrated our country and Capitol Hill as well." Mr. Donne.
asked for the Bureau's comments on this statement and what
procedures are being undertaken to meet the threat. €

Previously, Mr. John T. E1liff, Director, Domestil ¢
Intelligence Task Force, U. S. Senate Select Committee, had

written to Assistant Director W. R. Wannall also asking the

FBI's position regarding allegations that there are Soviet

agents on the staffs of seven senators.

In response to Mr. Elliff's request, a letter was
sent by Director Kelley on 10/30/75, to Senator Frank ‘Church,
Chairman, Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities. This letter
included as an enclosure a confidential memorandum for the
record, Summarizing a briefing which was given on 8/7/75, by
Assistant Director W. R. Wannall and Section Chief W. A.
Branigan. Present at the briefing were Mr. William G. Miller,
Staff Director of the U. S. Senate Select Committee, and
Mr. John T, Elliff, Director, Domestic Intelligence Task
Force of the Select Committee. The briefing concerned Soviet
and Soviet-bloc countries’ activiftes with respect to the —

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Allegations of Soviet
Penetrations on Capitol Hill

Since the request from Mr. Donner for the House
Committee is essentially the same request already received
from the Senate Committee, it seems appropriate to furnish
the House Committee a copy of Director Kelley's 10/30/75
letter to Senator Church with its attached memorandum for
the record and to offer a personal briefing to House Committee
representatives if they so desire.

Copies of Mr. Donner's letter to Director Kelley
and of Director Kelley's response to the House Select Committee
are attached.

ACTION:

: If you agree, the attached letter will be sent to
the Attorney General with the recommendation that the letter
and its enclosure be delivered to Congressmen Otis G. Pike,
Chairman, House Select Committee on Intelligence.

By way of background the House Select Committee had
scheduled the Bureau for testimony on 11/18/75 and we were \
tentatively scheduled for an appearance before the Senate Select
Committee on the same date. Assistant Director Wannall of the
Intelligence Division requested that the possible schedule con-
flict with ‘the captioned Committees be resolved, inasmuch as it NS
appeared the same Bureau personnel might be necessary to appe, cf N
before both Committees.’ CH

f

On 11/10/75, John T. Elliff, Task Force Director of
the Domestic Task Force was contacted by SA Paul V. Daly of wis
Division and informed SA Daly. that the Bureau's scheduled testimony
for 11/18/75 which was. to have been on COINTELPRO was being re-
scheduled.” He stated the whole format concerning Bureau testimony#
was being revamped and that it would not be necessary for a Bureau,
witness to appear on 11/18/75. Elliff stated that the Bureau woul
be advised of the new schedule as soon as it was finalized. 9

On 11/10/75, A. Searle Field, Staff Director of the H
House Select Committee, was. telephonically contacted concerning
the proposed Bureau testimony on 11/18/75 before that Committee. {5
It was pointed out to Field that there was a difference of opinion
between him and his Staff Members as to what would be the topic of§
the testimony. Field had indicated that the Bureau testimony would
be of a very general nature and that specific investigations would
not be addressed. It was also pointed out to him that ADEX would
not be a topic at the hearing. Yet, Staff Members of his Committee
have stated that there will be testimony concerning particular

Reference memorandum Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams u/a/ns, eb
reporting that on 11/11/75 Section Chief William E. Harward of the Laboratory/
with clearance, gave a deposition to representatives of the House Select:
Committee in their space. Er

This interview pertained to the Bureau's use of the U. S. Recording Company
for cutout purchases from other companies and was apparently precipitated by
previous testimony of Martin L. Kaiser, a small manufacturer of electronic
surveillance equipment.

During the interview a question was asked as to what other companies O
Bureau had made purchases of equipments relating to electronic surveillantes
other confidential techniques. Harward declined to answer without clarifidation
from Bureau Headquarters on the basis he had not been cleared to discuss
confidential techniques and that to name companies, some of which may be nearly
single-product companies, would tend to reveal equipments purchased.

Staff Counsel Vermiere and Oliphant agreed to await the requested
clarification. At the end of the interview, because they were pressed for time
and the court reporter was needed elsewhere, they agreed to let Harward go
to the Bureau and call;them with an answer. It is noted that at that time the
question was not clearly uhderstood and the court reporter was unable to
quickly locate the question. i

“s

This was made known! to Messrs. Cregar and Daly on Harward's return
and Mr. Daly was to seek clarification from the committee through Mr. Vermiere.

Memorandum W. E. Harward to Mr. Cochran
RE: HOUSTUDY

It now appears that the question is restricted to only those
companies whose products have been purchased through the U. S.
Recording Company.

Harward's reply to this question would be that equipment
manufactured by Telex, Uher, Nagra Magnetics, Northeast Electronics,
Knowles, Sony, Altec, Ademco, Adcor, Bell and Howell, and Custom
Electronics have been so purchased.

This response reveals companies that manufacture tape recorders,
microphones, alarm equipment, small transmitters, and dialed-number
recorders (pen registers), In some instances the Bureau has had personal
contact with personnel of these companies on a confidential basis. While
much of the equipment individually would not of itself warrant confidential
‘treatment, the quantities purchased are revealing of the Bureau's
capabilities in some areas and full disclosure of specific alarm systems
used to protect Bureau space could make them more vulnerable to attack.
This is stated not to argue that the information should not be given but
to point out that this information can be revealing of sources and
techniques.

It is further understood that the committee has separately
requested all records relating to purchases from the U. S. Recording
_{Company. If in fact these records are to be given, then the same
information which is being solicited from Harward will be furnished
in much more complete and detailed form. Harward can only provide
that information which comes to memory at this time.

It is to be noted that the U. S. Recording Company is a distributor
for many companies making sound equipment and that some items formerly
purchased from the U. S. Recording Company are now purchased directly
from the manufacturer.

If the reply set out above will satisfy the committee, the
7 damage may be less by furnishing it than the additional attention
which may be caused by referring this to the Department for a

RECOMMENDATION:

That Harward's reply as set out be furnished in response to
the House Committee's question.

On 11/4/75, Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly
of this Division met with A. Searle Field, Staff Director of
captioned Committee, to discuss the proposed testimony involving
the Bureau before that Committee which was reportedly slated for
November 11, 12, and 13. Field was informed that the Bureau
understood that the Committee was desirous of having Assistant
Director W. Raymond Wannall as a witness at these hearings and
Field was informed that Assistant Director Wannall would be un-
available for testimony on those days due to a prior commitment.
After discussion, Field tentatively scheduled the Bureau's
testimony for one day on_11/18/75 with Assistant Director
Wannall as the prime witness.

Field in a discussion concerning testimony expressed

his. view that additional Bureau testimony was. not necessary and
in fact, stated that the only reason why. the Bureau was slated £
for additional testimony before that Committee was because of 3
the request of Congressman Robert McClory, ranking minority

ember of captioned Committee. Field stated that he felt thater”
the House of Representatives' Committees and, in particular, *

the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the —"—"~
Committee on the Judiciary were currently doing an effective
oversight of the FBI and that the problems concerning. the

Bureau that had come to the attention of the Committee he
believed were minimum. For instance, he remarked that he was
surprised at how few people the Bureau had on the Administrative
Index and, therefore, indicated that he did not see the Admin-
istrative Index as a potential topic for testimony before that
Committee. He described the Bureau's investigation of the

Socialist Workers Party which has been a focal point of captioned
Committee's request as being a very small area and also indicated
he did not consider that it would be a viable topic for testimony.

Field envisioned the hearings as being general in nature
|} discussing basically the approval procedures for electronic sur-
veillance, a generic discussion on investigative procedures and,
baSically the testimony would cover. thé investigations in the
intelligence field in a general fashion rather than particularized
to individual investigations of organizations or individuals.

In this regard, it should be noted that Field's
portrayal of the hearings as he sees. them is inconsistent
with prior statements of Staff Members of the House Select
Committee and that given the composition of the Committee
itself the topic of the hearings are not predictable.
