Messrs. Richard Vermeire and Timothy Oliphant representing the Pike

Committee called at my office at 3:10 P.M. today and departed at 5:05 P.M. They

commenced their interview by asking for a general run down on how procurement is

handled within the FBI. In general, I explained that we adhered to the Federal

procurement regulations. They asked for a copy of these regulations and I advised

them that this would be furnished to them. I also advised as to the delegation of

authority by the Attorney General to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration

and the redelegation of his authority to the Director to enter into contracts with certain

limitations. I explained that the Director had redelegated his authority in accordance

with regulations to certain named Bureau officials, including myself, and that I was

generally responsible to serve as the Bureau contract officer. They asked what the

biggest contract was that I had ever administered and I advised them that it would bef

the FINDER contract amounting to just under s million dollars. They did not understand

the ditterence between procurement authority and authority to enter into contracts and

although reterence was made to procurements they did not pursue this and eventually

centered on contracts with U. S. Recording Company. In response to their specific

questions, I advised that I was not acquainted with Mr. Tate, President of U. S.

Recording and I had never met him. They wanted to know whether I was aware of any

specific documents which would show the origin of the Bureau's relationship with U. S.

Recording and I responded that I knew of none. They asked how the Bureau would

select an individual or a firm to whom a confidential contract would be awarded. I

answered that it appeared to me this would be based upon experience, prior relationship

which demonstrated ability to act responsibly in connection with a confidential contract,

experience within the intelligence community and the like. I advised there were no

written guidelines to this effect but that was my own feeling as to how a confidential

relationship was developed. As to confidential contracts which I had signed as Contract-

ing Officer, I advised that I recalled only one contract where 1 was the Contracting

Ofticer with U. S. Recording and that was a contract executed in June, 1975, in the

amount of approximately $168,000. They asked how I went about entering into this

contract and I responded that I observed the Federal procurement regulations and the

guidelines of the Department of Justice and that the contract had been personally approved

by the Attorney General. They did not ask and I did not furnish them any information

as to the subject matter of the contract.

Memorandum for Mr. Jenkins

Re: Interview by Messrs. Richard Vermeire

and Timothy Oliphant of Pike Committee

3:10 PM to 5:05 PM, 11-25-75

They then entered into a discussion as to my recollection of who preceded

me as Assistant Director of the Administrative Division and I advised them that I

had been preceded by N. P. Callahan, who in turn had been preceded by John P. Mohr

and before him Mr. Glavin. They asked about Mr. Mohr's other positions in the Bureau

and when I responded that he had been Assistant to the Director (Administrative) prior

to his retirement, one of them interjected a comment to the effect that wasn't Mr. Mohr

an Administrative Assistant to Mr. Tolson at one time and I acknowledged that this was

so. He wanted to know as to my relationship with Mr. Mohr and I advised that I had

never been to his home nor he to mine with one exception and that was the occasion of

Mr. Mohr's daughter's wedding when I did briefly visit Mr. Mohr's home. They asked

whether I had seen any of the gifts that had been given Mr. Mohr upon his retirement

and they particularly mentioned two gold-plated 38 caliber revolvers fashioned into

bookends. I stated I had no recollection of ever having seen these bookends. They then

asked whether we in the FBI customarily gave departing officials gifts. I responded

that departing Assistant Directors and above were presented with their badges suitably

mounted, a retirement plaque (which I described) and gold cuff links, the latter being

the gift of their colleagues.

They asked as to other retirement gifts that might be given

to departing officials and what part I might have played in that type of thing. I stated

that there was a custom in the Administrative Division and I thought quite generally in

other divisions that on the last day of a retiring employee's service we would have a

coffee and cake gathering in a suitable room within a division, covering the last two

hours of the working day, at which time friends and associates would call, some of whom

would present little departing gifts. They wanted to know what I did personally about

this and I said I would present the book of letters to the departing employee and that

It was customary to give the retiring employee a gift from his colleagues, which in my

division amounted to something purchased on the basis of a voluntary contribution from

the Agent colleagues in the division amounting to approximately $1.00 a man. This

would enable us to buy something like a camera, binoculars, miniature radio or some-

thing of that type and in my judgment this is what we all wanted to do on the occasion of

a retirement and it was a rather spontaneous and enthusiastic thing and I felt all shared

in my judgment that this was a fine thing to do. They wanted to know what gifts

Mr. Mohr was given upon his retirement. I advised I couldn't really recall any specific

gifts hehad received and I knew nothing about the pistolto which reference is made above.

They then took the tack of inquiring about how close current Bureau officials

are with Mr. Mohr. I stated I really could not respond to that. I did know that he had

an acquaintanceship with current and past officials, but to what extent I could not say.

They wanted to know if I had ever played poker at a lodge outside of Harpers Ferry,

West Virginia (which incidentally they indicated burned to the ground last week). I

responded that I had not and that I had turned down two or three invitations to play. They

wanted to know why I turned down these invitations and I responded that Mr. Mohr

Re: Interview by Messrs. Richard Vermeire

3:10 PM to 5:05 PM, 11-25-75

had asked me on two or three occasions to substitute for the regular card players

knowing that I had formerly played a lot of poker and that the only reason I declined

was frankly that my wife was not in favor of my staying away from home to play cards

and I felt that she is entirely right in this regard. They wanted to know who all

participated in these card games and I advised that I just did not know who all played.

They wanted to know what the financial arrangements were and I stated the only thing

that I knew was what Mr. Mohr told me on one occasion when he asked me to substitute

and that was that each one payed $25.00, which covered the room and food for an over-

night stay at the lodge, usually on a Friday night and extending into Saturday morning.

They wanted to know if Mr. Tate was in attendance at these card games and I stated

I did not know.

They then wanted to know whether we had any regulations dealing with conflict

of interest or the acceptance of gratuities. I stated that we followed Executive Order

11222, dated 5-8-65, and departmental regulations as published in the Federal Register.

I furnished them copies of these documents. They wanted to know whether from my own

standpoint I thought it was ever proper to accept any type of gratuity from a per son or

firm with which the FBI did business. I stated that I felt any type of gratuity would

be improper and that I personally had never accepted as much as a cup of coffee from

anyone with whom the FBI is doing business. Oliphant hastened to inject the comment

that I was not to read any implication into their question as they certainly had no

intention of suggesting that I had accepted any gratuities from anybody. They pressed

me as to whether there would be any exception to this and I indicated that the exception

was laid out in the Executive Order regarding food and beverage under certain limited

circumstances. They wanted to know who paid the expenses when Bureau officials took

trips in connection with the awarding of contracts. They were advised that Bureau

officials would be considered and properly so to be in an official duty status and per

diem was paid in accordance with standard Government travel regulations. They wanted

to know if there was such a thing as a higher rate of per diem for officials and I explained

that there was and outlined the controls we have governing the payment of the higher

rate of per diem.

They then went back to the subject of purchases and contracts with U. S.

Recording and wanted to know who determined whether the mark-up on such purchases

was reasonable. I responded that as far as I was concerned the determination of

reasonableness was based upon the judgment of Laboratory Division experts who were

aware of the going price for specific items, particularly in the electronics field and

it was my understanding that we were talking about a mark-up that generally would not

exceed 15% and probably would be less. They wanted to know whether I had ever

audited the books of U. S. Recording or had such an audit conducted so as to determine

Memorandum for Mr. Jenkins

Re: Interview by Messrs. Richard Vermeire

and Timothy Oliphant of Pike Committee

what the mark-up was. I responded that I had not and in response to their further

questioning indicated that as Contracting Officer in the one contract where I acted as

such I relied on the judgment of Laboratory Division experts that the price was

reasonable. They asked whether I had ever made a survey to determine the history

of the development of our relationship with U. S. Recording. I stated that I had not.

I asked them whether they were addressing this type of inquiry to anyone else within

the Bureau and they responded that they were and were asking for available documentation.

They returned to the subject of Mr. Mohr's current relationship with Bureau

officials and I responded that I knew Mr. Mohr had an acquaintanceship with some

Bureau officials and to what extent I just was not in a position to say. They wanted to

know whether I had ever visited in Mr. Callahan's home and he in mine. I replied that

we had not visited in each others' homes and that our social relationship was principally

through our attendance at dinners and other functions where we were both invitees but

that I considered Mr. Callahan as both a friend and associate and I thought his feelings

towards me were the same.

I took the occasion to comment to Messrs. Vermeire and Oliphant that I

definitely did not appreciate the comments made by their Chief Counsel Mr. Searle

when I testified in open hearingsbefore the Pike Committee to the effect that the FBI had

engaged in delaying tactics and were uncooperative in furnishing information requested

by the Committee. I pointed out that at that particular time the Pike Committee requests

pertained to the Bureau's budgetary process for which I was responsible and that as they

well knew my staff and I worked long hours overtime and through the weekend in order

to give timely responses to their inquiries within the very short deadlines they imposed

upon us. They expressed their appreciation for our efforts and stated that Searle's

expressed opinions did not represent their own.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. The foregoing is submitted to record the interview. As I did not take

On the early morning of November 19, 1975, Joetrait, telephone

number 488-3900, telephonically advised me that he has been requested

to appear for a staff interview under oath by representatives of the House

Select Committee on November 20, 1975. Mr. Tait said that he was advised

by the staff to have a lawyer with him at the interview. He said he did not

know the reason for such advice, but intended to attempt to engage counsel

to be present with him on November 20, 1975. He said that he intended to

employ James Gale and he asked me whether the FBI would have any

objection to such an arrangement in view of the fact that Mr. Gale

formerly was an Assistant Director of the FBI. Itold Mr. Tait that

it was my understanding that Mr. Gale was presently practicing law and

that I saw no reason for the FBI to interpose an objection should Mr. Tait

desire to engage Mr. Gale as his counsel for whatever reason.

Mr. Tait asked me if I had any advice for him. I responded

should he engage counsel my advice would be to diseuss the matter which

may arise in the interview with his attorney and to be guided by his attorney's

advice. I told Mr. Tait that requests for staff interviews called for a

voluntary appearance for the witness unless a subpoena has been issued.

He said that he has not received a subpoena, but only a request.

At 10:05 a.m., November 19, 1975, former Assistant Director

James Gale called my office and in my absence he advised that Joe Tait

had been in touch with him concerning Tait's request for legal counsel

in connection with his appearance before the Pike Committee. Mr. Gale

expressed some concern that if he were to represent Mr. Tait, the

Committee staff could learn that he was formerly associated with the FBI

By letter dated 11/5/75, addressed to Mr. Michael

Department of Justice, and forwarded to FBI Director Clarence M.

Kelley, Congressman Otis G. Pike, Chairman of the House Select

Committee on Intelligence, requested information regarding

"alleged and confirmed" incidents of Soviet-bloc penetrations of

Congressional staffs. The letter asked for all information

employed by Senator

Hastland's office during 1968 and who later

admitted to the fBl that he furnished sensitive information to

the soviets which he had obtained while employed for Senator

Eastland.

FBI representatives discusSed this matter on several

occasionwith Senator Eastland on a confidential basis and

Tolliver's employment was subsequently terminated by senator

tastland. In addition, Tolliver's vaRte 7o the soyiets wasl

In view of privacy considerations involving Senator

SECRET

Memorandum

to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Allegations of Soviet

Penetrations on Capitol Hill

We know of no other "American citizens and foreign

nationals" who may have improperly passed sensitive information

to Soviet-bloc intelligence agents without prior FBI knowledge.

Congressional staff members regularly volunteer to the FBI

facts regarding

their contacts with Soviet-bloc officials and

other persons who appear suspicious and who have an undue interest

in sensitive material.

Soviet-bloc officials often make efforts

to recruit sources and influential contacts on Capitol Hill

through whom they may obtain sensitive information. When the FBI

learns of such instances it advises the appropriate Congressman

and, if he has no objection, the FBI may interview the staff

member or, in some instances, consider utilization of him in an

operation, controlledby the FBI, aimed at determining the

' reason

for the individual's interest.

These operations are undertaken

between the FBI and the Congressman or staff member with an un-

derstanding of confidentiality and sometimes involve sensitive

sources and

methods.

To furnish such information to the House

Committee, it is felt, will not only violate the understanding

of confidentiality the FBI has had with the Congressman and

staff members involved, but may also jeopardize the sensitive

sources and methods which were utilized in some of these cases,

and have a detrimental effect on our future ability to fulfill

our foreign counterintelligence responsibilities.

The attached letter to Congressman Pike, therefore,

advises that for the reasons listed above, the FBI cannot fur-

nish the House Committee with information regarding these

individuals who confidentially volunteer to cooperate with the

FBI.

A copy of Congressman 'Pike's letter to Mr. Michael

Shaheen, Jy., is attached for information.

RECORDING COMPANY;

At 3:29 p.m. on November 19, 1975, John P. Mohr, former

Assistant to the Director, telephonically advised me that he had just

concluded an interview conducted by Richard Vermeire and Tim Oliphant

of captioned committee staff. He said he was not under oath and the

interviey was not recorded. He was asked concerning the U.S. Recording

Company arrangements with the FBI for the purchase of electronic

surveillance equipment. He said he told them that a former Assistant

Director of the FBI Laboratory, Ed Coffey, apparently had previously

made arrangements with U.S. Recording Company for the confidential

purchase of electronic surveillance equipment in behalf of the FBI and

when Mohr became the Assistant Director of the Administrative Division

he simply continued such arrangements. He said he lnows of no specific

decisions that were made to buy through Tait.

Mohr approved memoranda to the Attorney General from time to

time requesting authorization to make purchases of equipment when the

amounts involved were of such size as to require Departmental authorization,:

but he did not see or sign written purchase orders made through the U.S.

Recording Company. He said that he was aware that Tait had treated

Bureau purchases as contidential and in the past Tait has not divulged

Bureau interests.

*electronic surveillance

He said that Tait's usual fee for handling purchases was a 10 to

15% mark-up plus a reasonable labor charge in cases where modification

of equipment was necessary. He was asked whether Tait was paid as a

confidential source of the Bureau. Mohr first denied that, but then considered,

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: U.S. Recording Company

the fact that Tait's company was used as a "cut out" and that the fee paid to

Tait for such service could have been considered payments made to a

confidential source for services rendered. He was asked whether Tait had

charged a 30% mark-up as alleged by Martin Kaiser. Mohr said he was

not aware of instances involving a 30% mark-up and if such occurred it

would have been in excess of the usual fee paid to Tait.

Vir. Mohr said that he was confronted by Vermeire and Oliphant

with statements allegedly made by William Harward of the Laboratory

which seemed to imply that the Laboratory referred the requests to

purchase equipment to the Administrative Division and that Mohr authorized

purchases through U.S. Recording, Mr. Mohr indicated that the arrange-

ments for purchasing through U.s.

Recording were based on Laboratory

Division requests and not on Administrative Division or his own requests.

He commented that in regard to testimony by Martin Kaiser, it appeared

that the FBI Laboratory had made arrangements to purchase material

confidentially through U.S. Recording Company and then went directly

to the Martin Kaiser Company, specifying the purchase order requests,

and thereby revealing the FBI as a purchaser from Kaiser. He said that

such direct contact by the Laboratory made the arrangements with

U.S. Recording Company appear to be unnecessary and difficult to explain.

Mr. Mohr said that they did not indicate to him whether he would be

called as a witness before the Committee.

During September, 1975, staff members of the HSC were

permitted to review files relating to this Bureau's discontinued

Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros). By memorandum dated

October 6, 1975, this Bureau responded to a request of the HSC for:

delivery of certain Cointelpro documents, and these were actually

delivered to the Committee on October 7, 1975.

Among the material delivered to the Committee on

October I, 1975, was an FBI communication dated September 29,

1970, which indicated authorization was being requested to implement

a Cointelpro action against one Mr. James Edward Keenan.

This Bureau is in receipt of a copy of a letter dated

October 16, 1975, directed to the Deputy Attorney General from one

James Edward Keenan of Durham, North Carolina, In his letter,

Mx. Keenan states, "I was informed by a staff member of the House

Select Committee on Intelligence on October 15, 1975, that during the

year of 1970 I was the victim of certain activities of an FBI group

known as Cointelpro," and requests he be provided with records of

this Bureau pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information

Act.

Review of the files of this Bureau has determined the above

request for authorization for a Cointelpro action against MT. Keenan 1Nd&

was denied and he has never been the target of Cointelpro action,

Departmental Attorney Edward Christenbury will

accompany Bureau officials when captioned testimony is

given.

In discussion between Mr. Christenbury and

representatives of the Legal Counsel Division, the

following responses and guidance to possible questions were

suggested:

This testimony will particulary concern our

investigation of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a curen

investigation, and our investigation of Institute

Policy Studies, a closed investigation. Questions may

develop in these matters which concern other current

investigations.

We should explain that we are testify

ing publicly concerning the current investigation of

SWP because many of the details of this investigation

including our basis for it are already on the public

record in a civil suit brought by SWP. If, however,

questions are asked concerning other current investigations

we should request that these be answered in Executive

Session.

We should also request Executive Session if

questions are asked concerning particular nameo

Individuals who are plaintifts in the civil suit or

concerning third parties.

This request would arise

from our desire to protect : insofar as possible the

confidentiality of our investigations of named

individuals and from our desire to protect the

privacy of third parties.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

Re:

Testimony by Bureau Officials before

House Select Committee; 11/18/75

The question of electronic surveillance of

Peoples Coalition for Peace™

and Justice (PCPJ) may

arise since this matter was touched upon by the

House Select Committee staff when they took deposi-

tions from SAs Terry O'Connor and Bill Tucker. We

should advise the Committee, if a question of this

nature is asked, that we have made a claim of

Executive Privilege on this information in the past

which was done in the civil suit brought by David

Dellinger. If pressed by the Committee in this regard,

it is suggested that Bureau officials

state that they

will be glad to discuss the Committee's request with

the Attorney General and obtain his advice on what

information should be furnished the Committee concern-

ing any electronic surveillance of PCPJ.

Concerning requests for Executive Session

which is based on danger to national security, the

Committee will hear this type of information in

Executive Session following a vote to do so by/Committee.

Rule 4.4 of the House Select Committee rules also

states that if the testimony to be given may tend to

defame, degrade, or incriminate any person that

testimony shall

be received in Executive Session.

RECOMMENDATION:

None. For information.

SUBJECT: Demonstration at Bureau of Indian Affairs Building

As you, know, some American indians, súpported by other

individuals, have been occupying the Bureau of Indian

Affairs Building in Washington, D. C. for the past several,

days.

There is in effect a court order requiring the

demonstrators to vacate the building, but thus far they

have not done so.

Reports over the past few days indicate that certain

known members of the Black Panther Party, the Vietnam Veterans

Against the War, and other activist organizations have joined

the individuals presently occupying the building and various

types of weapons have been carried into the juilding.

The

Individuals occupying the building have also siphoned off

gasoline into cans and have it inside the building, much of

which has been barricaded.

It is requested that the Bureau take appropriate

steps

to secure any information which bears on the question of

potential civil disturbance in connection with the present

occupation of and anticipate eviction from the Bureau of

Indian Affairs. It is requested that any information so

developed be furnished telephonically to the Department of .

Justice Communication Center on Ext. 2364, as soon as it is

committed at Wounded Knee and their attorneys will be present

at these upcoming events, and because of the possibility that

a couct could feel that the use of informants under these

circumstances might violate the defendants right to consult

confidentially with their attorneys, neither active investiga-

cion of AIM nor the use of informants at these events are neces

sary.

In addition, no informants are to be used at any time

os place where they might violate the right of a person under

indictment to consult confidentially with his attorney.

Should actual Federal criminal offenses be reported

during 'any of these activities, it is requested that the FBI

immediately advise the appropriate United States Attorneys

Office, and take such action as would. be taken if the offenses

had occurred at a time other than during one of these special

events. It is also requested that. the FBI immediately advise

the Criminal Division of any offenses that are reported during

these events.

Reference is made to my memorandum to you dated

April 22, 1974, captioned "American Indian lovement Extremist

Matter, Action Memorandum," in which I indicated that in-

fornants should not be used at any tize or place whare they

might violata the right of a person under indictment to

consult confidentially wich his attorney.

Reference is also made to a teletype dated August 16,

1974 from your Omaha office to the Director and captioned

*American Indian Movement," in which it is reported that a

"source advised the dafense in the Wounded Knee leadership

trial in St. Paul, Minnesota, will rest their case on or

about Augast 16, 1974, and Banks expects to be free to

traval extensively after that date."

Since these Lacis

indicate the possibility that the source may have obtained

this infomation contrary to the spirit of my April 22,

1974 memorandum, it is brought to your attention for whatever

action you may deem appropriate.

By way of background the House Select Committee had

scheduled the Bureau for testimony on 11/18/75 and we were

tentatively scheduled for an appearance before the Senate Select

Assistant Director Wannall of the

Intelligence Division requested that the possible schedule con-

flict with the captioned Committees be resolved, inasmuch as it

appeared the same Bureau personnel might be necessary to appear

before both Committees.

On 11/10/75, John I. Elliff, Task Force Director of

the Domestic Task Force was contacted by SA Paul V. Daly of this

Division and informed SA Daly. that the Bureau's scheduled testimony

for 11/18/75 which was to have been on COINTELPRO was being re-

scheduled.

He stated the whole format concerning Bureau testimony-

was being revamped and that it would not be necessary for a Bureaut

witness to appear on 11/18/75. Elliff stated that the Bureau would

be advised of the new schedule as soon as it was finalized.

On 11/10/75, A. Searle Field, Staff Director of the

House Select Committee, was telephonically contacted concerning

the proposed Bureau testimony on 11/18/75 before that Committee.

It was pointed out to Field that there was a difference of opinion

between him and his Staff Members as to what would be the topic of

the testimony. Field had indicated that the Bureau testimony would

be of a very

. general nature and that specific investigations would

not be addressed.

It was also pointed out to him that AdEX would

Reference memorandum Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams 11/12/75, Hipo

reporting that on 11/11/75 Section Chief William E. Harward of the Laboratory,

with clearance, gave a deposition to representatives of the House Select

Committee in their space.

This interview pertained to the Bureau's use of the U. S. Recording Company

for cutout purchases from other companies and was apparently precipitated by

previous testimony of Martin L. Kaiser, a small manufacturer of electronic

surveillance equipment.

During the interview a question was asked as to what other companies t

Bureau had made purchases of equipments relating to electronic surveillances or

other confidential techniques. Harward declined to answer without clarification

from Bureau Headquarters on the basis he had not been cleared to discuss

confidential techniques and that to name companies, some of which may be nearly

single-product companies, would tend to reveal equipments purchased.

Staff Counsel Vermiere and Oliphant agreed to await the requested

clarification. At the end of the interview, because they were pressed for time

and the court reporter was needed elsewhere, they agreed to let Harward go

to the Bureau and call them with an answer. It is noted that at that time the

question was not clearly understood and the court reporter was unable to

quickly locate the question.

This was made known' to Messrs. Cregar and Daly on Harward's return

and Mr. Daly was to seek clarification from the committee through Mr. Vermiere.

Memorandum W. E. Harward to Mr. Cochran

RE: HOUSTUDY

It now appears that the question is restricted to only those

Recording Company •

Harward's reply to this question would be that equipment

manufactured by Telex, Uher, Nagra Magnetics, Northeast Electronics,

Knowles, Sony, Altec, Ademco, Adcor, Bell and Howell, and Custom

Electronics have been so purchased.

This response reveals companies that manufacture tape recorders,

contact with personnel of these companies on a confidential basis. While

much of the equipment individually would not of itself warrant confidential

treatment, the quantities purchased are revealing of the Bureau's

capabilities in some areas and full disclosure of specific alarm systems

used to protect Bureau space could make them more vulnerable to attack.

This is stated not to argue that the information should not be given but

to point out that this information can be revealing of sources and

techniques.

It is further understood that the committee has separately

requested all records relating to purchases from the U. S. Recording

Company. If in fact these records are to be given, then the same

information which is being solicited from Harward will be furnished

in much more complete and detailed form. Harward can only provide

that information which comes to memory at this time.

It is to be noted that the U. S. Recording Company is a distributor

for many companies making sound equipment and that some items formerly

purchased from the U. S. Recording Company are now purchased directly

from the manufacturer.

On 11/4/75, Inspector John B. Hotis and SA Paul V. Daly

of this Division met with A. Searle Field, Staff Director of

captioned Committee, to discuss the proposed testimony involving

the Bureau before that Committee which was reportedly slated for

November 11, 12, and 13.

Field was informed that the Bureau

understood that the Committee was desirous of having Assistant

Director W. Raymond Wannall as a witness at these hearings and

Field was informed that Assistant Director Wannall would be un-

available for testimony on those days due to a prior commitment.

After discussion, Field tentatively scheduled the Bureau's

testimony for one day on 11/18/75 with Assistant Director

Wannall

as the prime witness.

Field in a discussion concerning testimony expressed

his view that additional Bureau testimony was not necessary and

in fact, stated that the only reason why the Bureau was slated

for additional testimony before that Committee was because of

the request of Congressman Robert McClory; ranking minority

(member of captioned Committee.

Field stated that he felt that

the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the

Committee on the Judiciary were currently doing an effective

oversight of the FBI and that the problems concerning the

Bureau that had come to the attention of the Committee he

believed were minimum.

For instance, he remarked that he was

surprised at how few

people the Bureau had on the Administrative

Index and, therefore, indicated that he did not see the Admin-

istrative

Index as a potential topic for testimony before that

Committee. He described the Bureau's investigation of the

RE:

Socialist Workers Party which has been a focal point of captioned

Committee's request as being a very small area and also indicated

he did not consider that it would be a viable topic for testimony.

Field envisioned the hearings as being general in nature

discussing basically the approval procedures for electronic sur-

veillance, a generic discussion on investigative procedures and

basically the testimony would cover the investigations in the

intelligence field in a general fashion rather than particularized

to individual investigations of organizations or individuals.

In this regard, it should be noted that Field's

portrayal of the hearings as he sees them is inconsistent

with prior statements of Staff Members of the House Select

Committee and that given the composition of the Committee

itself the topic of the hearings are not predictable.
