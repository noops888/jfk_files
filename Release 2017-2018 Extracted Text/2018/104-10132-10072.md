the undersigned on the morning of 18 May 1964 of statements
made to her on Thursday evening 14 May, which associated
the CIA with the assassination of President Kennedy. She
wanted a report of the conversation made known to the Office
of Security. 7

Georges County, Maryland, and several months previously had
registered as a Republican in order to vote in the up-coming
primary elections, ...This past Thursday night a Mrs. Sherwood

telephoned Mrs, indicating she was one of the Delegates
on the Republican ballot and was supporting Senator Barry
Goldwater. Mrs, told Mrs, Sherwood that she had not

decided which candidate to support, and that although she had
registered Republican she held a deep respect for the late
President Kennedy. Mrs. Sherwood then made some disparaging
remarks about the late President Kennedy. She also furnished
specific information regarding what she described as a
reliable prediction, made prior to November 1963, that
President Kennedy would be assassinated.

3. Mrs, Sherwood indicated that an acquaintance in West
Virginia, who said he was a former CIA courier, had told her
prior to the assassination of President Kennedy that President
Kennedy would be assassinated and that the assassin in turn
would also,,be killed. Mrs. Sherwood further advised, according
to Mrs | that her attempts to locate this person in
West Virginia, after the assassination, were not successful.
Apparently, in Mrs. Sherwood's words, this person "just dis-
appeared from sight", following the assassination of President
Kennedy.
