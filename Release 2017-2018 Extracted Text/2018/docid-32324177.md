DL 137-1387

ALREADOWS (Dallas 166-84) is operating a "square

game" in thelballas area and because he has made enough money

from crooked games, is able to do this.

FOLSE stated that he desires to cooperate fully with

the FBI on a confidential basis and for money.

He stated he

is willing and when he makes one of his frequent trips to Las

Vegas, he will obtain information concerning activities in Las

Vegas as well as the activities of the Las Vegas group and

furnish same to the Dallas Office.

FOLSE stated there is no syndicate contact in the

Dallas

area, to the best of his knowledge, and that the Dallas

group, specifically WILLIAM RAY DAVIS, does not need any syn-

dicate contacts.

FOLSE indicated he was well acquainted with numerous

people in Las Vegas and that he had knowledge of the gambling

operations there.

It was noted by interviewing Agents that

FOLSE at this point of the interview had decided he would furnish

his information after he had possibly been remunerated for what

he had already furnished.

He had been previously advised that

he would be paid on a c.o.l. basis for pertinent and productive

Intormation and only aiter it had been evaluated by the Agents.

He was agreeable to this. He was also advised that the Bureau

in no way would pay for his gambling activities or expenses and

he was also agreeable to this.

Arrangements were made for future contacts with FOLSE

by SAs ROBERT M. BARRETT and IVAN D. LES. FOLSE was instructed

never to contact the Dallas Office personally, that he was not

an employee of the FBI, that he was to furnish information only

to the Bureau Agents, and that the relationship between himself

and the FBI must be strictly confidential.

UACE, further contacts will be made with FOLSE for

development as a Top Echelon Informant in view of the above

information furnished by him. It is believed such contacts can

be productive and it is the opinion of the contacting Agents

FOLSE is well acquainted with the gambling element in both

Dallas and Las Vegas. These contacts will be carefully planned

beforehand and efforts will be made by the Dallas Office to

assure that fOLSt is furnishing information for the reasons

he has stated and is not being used by the gambling element in

any manner.

It is the opinion of the contacting Agents that

FOLSE is in a position to penetrate the organized criminal

element in Dallas and Las Vegas.
