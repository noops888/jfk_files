AND THEREBY SET RUSSIA BACK, FOR MANY YEARS. WE AGREED NICHOLAS

HAD BEEN A FOOL, THEREBY REMOVING ANY MONARCHIST CONSIDERATIONS

HE MAY HAVE HAD ABOUT US, AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO PROCEED. IN APPRE-

CIATIVE WORDS KARASEV PRAISED AMERICA'S HELP IN THE THIRTIES

WHICH PUT THE USSR ON ITS FEET. HOPED THAT SIMILAR COOPERATION *

COULD NOW BE ENGINEERED TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR PRESENT DAY ECONOMIC

DIFFICULTIES. CONTRARY REMARKS OF MANY PEOPLE, KARASEV SAID,

HE REALIZED THEIR AUTO INDUSTRY, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD NOT BEGIN TO

COMPETE WITH OURS AND MANY EVERY DAY ITEMS WE ENJOY ARE LUXURIES

TO THEM.. WISHED NO WAR WOULD COME BETWEEN US SO THEY COULD

WORK: AT BETTERING THEIR LIVING STANDARD. WE REPLIED WE APPRECIATED

HIS VIEWS BUT COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY USSR CONTINUES ITS ANTI

AMERICAN PROPAGANDA IF THEY TRULY DESIRE OUR SYMPATHY AND HELP.

KARASEV SAID THAT THIS NOT TRUE.: THEY NOT WAGING PROPAGANDA WAR

SO ENDED OUR FRAGMENTARY CONVERSATION ON THIS TOPIC®

5. TARATUNKIN BROUGHT UP OUR "PROVOCATION" IN TONKIN BAY.

SHERWOOD QUILINED OUR POSITION.

6 KARASEV DISCUSSED OSWALD CASE AND ASKED OUR OPINION. WE

SAID THAT WARREN COMMISSION'S REPORT WOULD SOON BE OUT WITH ALL THE

FACTS, BUT PERSONALLY WE HAD SOME RESERVATIONS AS TO WHAT REALLY

• HAPPENED TO OSWALD DURING HIS STAY IN THE USSR. KARASEV CAUGHT

THE IMPLICATION AND REPLIED THAT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF

OSWALD HAD BEEN IN CHINA BUT NOT IN THE SOVIET UNION. HE SAID

OSWALD HAD ONLY BEEN A DILETTANTE IN MINSK AND APPARENTLY HAD SOME

E HE MARRIES,

OTHER WOMEN THERE BEFORA 3 • 448ED. KARASEV THEN SAID HE COULD

NOT HELP BUT BELIEVE THAT RUBY WAS TOOL OF "REACTIONARY FORCES"

AND COULD NOT SEE HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FOR RUBY TO HAVE

SHOT OSWALD WITHOUT ASSISTANCE OF SOME U.S. OFFICIALS. WE TRIED

DEBUNK THIS IMPRESSION, BUT KARASEV HELD TO HIS VIEWS.
