ARAGON said that MIRO CARDONA went to PRIO's residence in
Miami and asked for PRIO's support and anything that PRIO could
do that could enhance the position of the Revolutionary Council.
ARAGON advised that at this meeting PRIO promised his support,
put also asked Dr. MIRO to put several of his, PRIO's, men on
the payroll of the Revolutionary Council. ARAGON stated that Dr.
MIRO told him that the Council did not handle the money, as this
was at that time handled directly by the FRD, ARAGON stated
that.Dr. MIRO and CARLOS PRIO-have met several times since
and on each occasion Dr. PRIO has informed Dr. MIRO that he is
in support of Dr. MIRO but then PRIO goes on and makes propaganda
which definitely is against Dr. MIRO and in his, PRIO's, favor.

y ARAGON advised that as a result of recent statements made by

| Dr. PRIO, Dr. MIRO CARDONA no longer has any desire to speak
with CARLOS PRIO.

BY 2865-S advised that.in early September, 1961,
he was with GUILLERMO ALONSO PUJOL in New York, and PUJOL
showed him a confidential letter‘on the stationery of the U.S.
House of Representatives written by VICTOR L. ANFUSO to Secretary
of State DEAN RUSK. NY 2865-S stated he was not sure of the
date of this letter but believed it was 8/27 or 28/61. In this
letter to DEAN RUSK, Representative ANFUSO asked RUSK to
recognize a Cuban government in exile and offer it all the
necessary assistance in order to overthrow the present Cuban
Government. ANFUSO also, in his letter to RUSK, stated that
Dr. CARLOS PRIO had supported Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA as
Provisional President in the event such a government in exile

was recognized by the United States CX U

i From information available thusfar, there does not
appear to be any definite plans on the part of CARLOS PRIO to ,
set up a government in exile in a Latin country. The Cuban
exiles are divided about PRIO and the majority of them greatly

| question his ability to unify a majority of Cubans.

4) INVASION EFFORTS

There has been no information received from Cuban
exiles in the Metropolitan New York area indicating any serious
plans to mount an invasion from the US to Cuba. There are also
no reports of any invasion being planned by individuals in the

ARAGON stated that he and Dr. MIRO CARDONA discussed problems vy
facing the Revolutionary Council and what the Revolutionary wae
Council believes should be done in the Cuban question. He

also advised that the main.difficulty of the Revolutionary

Council is with liaison /with CIA, | ARAGON stated that at mas( BY 4)
last meeting with RICH. GOODWIN’ on 9/14/61, GOODWIN advise’

that there was a retired Colonel from the New England area, H
now under transfer to Miami, who would act,as liaison man betwee
Dr. MIRO CARDONA, the White House /and GIA,| ARAGON stated thal u)
he was informed by GOODWIN that this man Would have complete
authority to make final decisions in all matters. ARAGON

advised that as of 9/25/61, when he last spoke to Dr. MIRO

CARDONA, Dr. MIRO stated that he had not yet been contacted

by this liaison man. ARAGON also stated that neither he

nor Dr, MIRO CARDONAWas given the name of this man, but they

were informed that Dr. MIRO would be contacted by this individual
on his arrival in Florida. id

ARAGON also expressed his personal opinionregarding
RICHARD GOODWIN and other advisors at the White House by stating
that they were very brilliant young men who can advance wonderful
theories but cannot put anything into practical working order.

ARAGON also stated (that CIA continues to operate
with various underground groups, and these groups are being
supported by CIA,] ARAGON advised that, the underground insiae() uj i
Cuba is being built up and it is becoming efficient, but AR.
believes that there is a lack of coordination and a lack of
authority and although it is possible by underground activity to
overthrow. the present Cuban Government, he believes that
unless this matter of unification is attended to immediately,
the end result could be chaos and untold bloodshed.

also statedXthat his contact at CIA is one
ith whom he is in regular contact.and who

ARAGON advised Chat the Revolutionary Council has been tah

a financial cut by CIA and this,|to a great extent, has Uujye
hampered the activity of the ReVolutionary Council. ARAG

the Revolutionary Council by four, and he, ARAGON, had given !
the names of the four individuals to.ROBERT HURWITCH, of State {
Department, to see if the State Department. opposed any of these :
individuals. ARAGON identified the -fo Ey ed memkerg of the — :

ists

°
select anyone he wants but must exélude all Batistianos, Commi
and fellow travelers.

ARAGON stated that he was not entirely optimistic
about the future of Cuba. ARAGON said that the Cuban people
cannot be entirely unified as there are so many politically
ambitious leaders among the exiles and there are many jealousies
and there ws much criticism leveled against the Revolutionary
Council and the United States Government because of the
unsuccessful invasion of April, 1961, ARAGON advised that the
pehieved that ‘the Cuban Government was. weakened day by day, |
that the underground would eventually overthrow CASTRO, together i
with the economic hardships which the Cuban Government is |
suffering, but without a strong unifiedopposition and 100
per cent cooperation from the United States, he saw a very
unhappy picture for Cuba in years to come. |

The Bureau is respectfully requested that if the |
above information is disseminated, extreme care be used concerning |
information furnished by ERNESTO ARAGON. ARAGON has cooperated
fully with the New York Office, is cognizant of what is being
done with the Revolutionary Council and Dr. MIRO CARDONA in
particular. It is also pointed out that at some of these meetings
at the White House there were only two or three individuals
present and his identity could easily be determined if information
furnished by him is not properly paraphrased. i
