MM 92-882

On November 14, 1963, HAROLD FIELDS, 901 N. E.

180th Street, Miami, Morida, who has been observed in the

company of ANTHONY/RICCI, subject of Miami file 92-112, was

interviewed by SA LARRY A. FABLE.

FIELDS stated that he

is a court reporter and records the proceedings of various

hearings such as those conducted by the Labor Management

Relations Board, which is an agency of the federal Govern-

ment. FIELDS' identity is to be protected since he is to

be developed as a PCI by the Miami Office.

FIELDS identified a photograph of ANTHONY RICCI

and said that he met RICCI about ten months ago. At this

time RICCI and JULIUS KAPLAN had a room at the Argosy Motel,

17425 Collins Avenue, Dade County, Florida... FIELDS said

that RICCI and KAPLAN had an employee of the motel by the

name of BEN SAVAGE taking book on horse races for them. He

said that he could not definitely implicate RICCI in this

bookmaking operation but stated that RICCI was always "hang-

ing around" and it appeared that RICCI had an interest in

the operation. FIELDS explained that at that time (about ten

months ago) he, FIELDS, was using the beach facilities of

the Argosy Motel to keep himself in physical shape.

He added that he had recently run into RICCI at

Dagwood's Restaurant, 17004 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, at

which time RICCI told him that he now hangs around the Golden

Nugget and Thunderbird Motels. RICCI also told him that

JULIUS

KAPLAN is now in the Los Angeles, California area.

FIELDS described RICCI as an individual with "class"

who does not talk much about himself.

He has heard rumors

that RICCI is connected with the Mafia.
