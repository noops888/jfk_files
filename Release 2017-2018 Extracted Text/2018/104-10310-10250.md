5. It im believed that the trial of Masferrer or
any of his colleagues could damage Agency intereats in
ene or all of the following sectors:

a. Unfavorable publicity concerning
Agency operations against the Cuban target,
notably maritime infiltration operations
based in southern Florida.

in the past, 2a well as the identity of a ausber of former
agents of the JHWAVE Btation. Although, by extrapolation
and by exbroidering on information and rumors circulating
in the Cuban exile community Cabeza probably cauld present
@ picture of JMBAVE activity which might appear exciting
te the layman, it seens unlikely that he hes accegs to any
significant amount of information concerning sensitive
current ectiyities. While to the knowledgeable person,

SUMAVE/IHOCEAH. In summary it is most unlikely that eny
future good would result from a trial of Masferrer and/or
any of his associates, and it ig highly probable that there
would be created a climate which would meke JHWAVE
operations——of ail types--more difficult to carry cut in

& secure and economical manner. This is not to sry that
SWWAVE would have to go out of business. This was sot the
ease in the “Zenith” flap, mor is it likely to be the cage
with Masferrer. However, there appears to be little doubt
that the threshold of sensitivity to Agency activities on
the part ef the general public end of these persona who,
fron whatever motives, question the advisability of the
Agency: “operating™ within the U.S. would be raised.

13. Im addities to the foregoing points it should be
noted that bistericaily the similnrity of this operation
end the “Bay ef Pigs" could reopen the whole question and
