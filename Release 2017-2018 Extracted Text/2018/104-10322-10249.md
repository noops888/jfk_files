You asked

the other day

about public statements made

by either Mr. Bush or Mr.

Colby concerning Agency

policy on assassinations.

Attached is far more than I

am sure you ever wanted to.

know about this subject.

You will note however, among

all this verbiage'

the only

really explicit public state-

ment against assassinations

or at least the only one

that the computer has recorded

is the one made by Mr. Colby

in his TV appearance in

October 1975.

Mr. Bush's

only public reference is in

an implicit rejection. Would

you please return these

statements if you have no need

for them as I assume the

subject will reoccur each time

the new investigating committee

turns the subject over.

L1 JANUARY 21, 1976 DANIEL SCHORR INTERVIENS WILLIAM E. COLBY

EE

THERE HAS BEEN A NEED TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BRINGING AMERICAN

INTELLIGENCE CLEA

RLY

UNDER AMERICA'S CONSTITUTION

AND LEGAL

SYSTEM.

I THINK

INTELLIGENCE

WAS

THAT

SOMEHOW

IT WAS

OUTSIDE OF LAW,

IT

THE

TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF

REALLY DIDN'T

HAVE ANYTYING MU

CH TO DO

WITH LAW, AND IT

SOMEHOW WAS

SOMETHING THAT NATIONS DID

THAT'S NO GOOD FOR AMERICA.

WE

BUT DIDN'T

TALY:

AND WE'VE BEEN

IN

THAT:

CLE

ARLY.

TO US IN THE

AS

AMERICAN PEOPLE

SCHORR: DID

YOU

IT COULD

BE HANDLED

BUT

THEN

AND

WE WENT THROUGH

SIX

MONTHS OF

WITH ALL

SORTS OF

INCLINED TO

THINK THAT

SPEND

CLEARLY

THIS PARTICULAR

YOU KNOW,

OVER

SCHORR: YOU SAID THAT YOU NEVER ORDERED ANY ASSASSINATION AND THAT

YOU

WERE NEVER

FOR ASSASSINATION.

THAT

IT'S

ABSOLUTELY NOT,

NO.

WITH ANY CONSPIRACY AGAINST MR.

SAID THAT

THERE WERE AFEW: MISS

TEPS:

THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR

THRT

CERTAIN

ACTIVITY WAS PERFECTLY PROFER AND WITHIN OUR CHARTE

. THINGS

WE DID WERE

UNPROPER,

SOME DONE AT THE SPECIFIC DIRECTION OF

TH

E PRESIDENT. SOME DONE BECAUSE THERE WAS A GRAY. AREA AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE AND WHA

SHOULD

NOT BE

DONE. AND

•SOME DONE

BECAUSE OF AN

EXCESS OF ACTIVITYA

AND I THINK. HON

AT A PERIOD WHEN THERE

WAS SOME CONFUSION AS

TO WHETHER WE WERE DOING:

UNINTELLIGIBLE›.

AS

THINK

THE

CONTEXT

FOR THE MASSIVE DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY, I THINK IF YOU'LL

LOOK THROUGH

THE REPORTS, YOU

3

LL FIND THAT WE ESSENTIALLY HAD THREE AGENTS WHO DID THINGS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE.

WELL

THAT'S

HARDLY

A MASSIVE

INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION.

THAT IT WASN'T MASSIVE AND IT WASN'T

ILLEGAL.

SOME FEW OF THEM,

as one

AND WE

COOPERATED

THEY

SIX MONTHS OF VERY INTENSIVE

YOU WILL

FIND

INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT CIA

THAT

THEY FIND

FIVE CASES,
