COMMENTS (Number each comment te, show from whom
Draw a line across column after each comment.)

Mr.) Grinwis | You asked the other day

about public statements made
iby either Mr. Bush or Mr.
Colby concerning Agency
policy on assassinations.
Attached is far more. than I
lam sure you ever wanted to-
know about this subject.

You will note however, among
all this. verbiage’ the only
really explicit public state-
ment against assassinations
or at least the only one

that the computer has recorded.
is the one made by Mr. Colby
in his TV appearance in
October 1975. Mr. Bush's
only public reference is in
an implicit rejection.. Would
ws you please return these
statements if you have no need
for them as I assume ‘the
subject will reoccur each time
the new investigating committee
turns the subject over.

THESE NATTERS WERE DISCUSSED AT THE TIMES, ARE VERY MURKY AS TO WHO WAS PART OF IT AND
HHERE THE APPROVAL IND HOM DETAILED THE APPROVAL HAS. WISE: BUT YOURE SAYING THAT IT
WAS A SUBJECT. COLBY: IT 15 NOT A SUBJECT FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION. MISE: ARE YOU SAYING
THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT OR COLBY: 1 AN SAVING THE SITUATION MAS VERY MURKY AND THAT I &
EALLY DON’T GELIEVE THAT THIS SUBJECT IS AN APPROPRIATE ONE FOR AN OFFICIAL TO BE TALK
ING ABOUT NISE: BUT HOW ARE NE GOING TO GET THE FACTS ABOUT IT THEN? COLEY: WE HAVE &
FEORTEO ALL THE FACTS TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE. THEY HAVE EXAMINED THE MATTER TNDEPENDE

BS WELL. AND I THINK THEY CAN COME TO A CONCLUSION ON THE BASIS OF THE EVIDENCE AvEILA
GLE TO THEN. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT FPPROPRIATE FOR OPEN PUBLIC DISCUSSION, BEC 4°
THINK WE CRN HURT GUR COLINTRY VERY SERIGUSLY. SCHORR: DOES THAT NEAN WHEN SENATOR Hou
DALE MENTIONS, AS HE DIO IN A SPEECH THIS WEEK, THE EXISTENCE OF A GROUP CALLED THE E
ECUTIVE ACTION GROUP FOR A COUPLE GF YEARS IN THE EARLY SIXTIES WHICH WAS CHARGED WITH
RESPONSIBILITY FOR NAKING PLANS, HYPOTHETICAL OR NOT, FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF ¥ARIGU
PERSONS, THAT YOU'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT THIS? COLBY: HWE HAVE REPORTED EVERYTHING O
N THIS GENERAL SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEES. BUT I DON’T BELIEVE THAT IT’S APPROPRIATE FG
R PUBLIC DISCUSSION. SCHORR: YOU DON’T DISPUTE THE LITTLE THAT SENATOR MONDALE HAS TOL
b ABOUT? COLBY: 1 DON?T SAW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, I JUST DON’T BELIEVE THE SUBJECT IS
ARPROPRIATE FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION. PUBLIC DISCUSSION WHEN THE SENATE REPORT COMES OUT
COLGY: THERE HAS SEEN QUITE A LOT OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION, SCHORR: THERE HAS BEEN. COLe’’
BUT I DON’T THINK IT APPROPRIATE FOR NE TO DISCUSS IT IN GREAT DETAIL. HERNAN: ARE ¥
GU SATISFIED WITH THE PROSPECTS FOR SECURITY OF WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD THE THO COMMITTEES?
COLBY: I THINK OUR RECORD TO DATE HAS BEEN QUITE
IN THE SENATE. HERMAN: NO. I°M TALKING ABOUT THEM. HR. COLBY. COLBY: YES. HERKAN
Bo WOU THINK THAT THEY MILL KEEP SECURE THE THINGS THAT OU KANT KEPT SECURE? COLEY:
NELL, T THINK THE SENATE HAS KEPT ITS MATTERS QUITE CAREFUL. WE HAD A OTSC

SSION LAST WEEK, @S YOU KNOM, HITH THE HOUSE COMMITTEE AS TO THE DETAILS OF HOW Ke soe
LD 00 THINGS. AND I THINK THAT 15 AN ARRANGEMENT: I17S A COMPROMISE ARRANGEMENT, FIN? 1
T AFFORDS A VEHICLE FOR REASONABLE HEN TO COME TO GOO CONCLUSIONS AS TO WHAT SHOUL> &
E EXPOSED AND WHAT SHOULD BE KEPT QUIET. THERE NAY EE SOME INDIVIDUAL LEAKS. YOU JOURN
ALISTS ARE VERY ENERGETIC IN PROSECUTING THE POSSIBLE STATENENTS OF GNE MAN AND COMPAR
ING IT WITH ANOTHER AND ADDING UP TO AN OVERALL STORY. BUT I NOULO HGPE THAT THE ©
PLINE OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE COMMITTEES AND THEIR STAFFS WOULD BE AS GOOD AS THE
CISCIPLINE OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. fiND NEITHER WILL BE PERFECT. NEITHER ARE PERFECT A
T_THE MOMENT. BUT I HOULD HOPE THAT WE AMERICANS, AS ME TRY TG MAKE INTELLIGENCE RESFO

NSIBLE, WE CAN BE RESPONSIGLE OURSELVES IN THE WAY WE DO IT. WISE: MR, COLBY, Sou SAID
THAT ASSASSINATION I5 NOT A GOOD SUBJECT TO GE DISCUSSING PUBLICLY. BUT AT A HEARING
ABOUT THO WEEKS AGO, YOU DISPLAYED THAT POISON DART GUN AT THE CHURCH COMMITTEE HEARIN

GIN THE SENATE. AND I WONDERED IF THAT GUN OR THAT TWPE OF WEAPON HAS BEEN USED AGAIN
ST ANY FOREIGN POLITICAL FIGURES. COLEY: THE GUN HAS NOT BEEN USED. “THE GUN WAS BROUGH
T UP THERE BECAUSE THE SENATE CONMITTEE RATHER INSISTED ON ITS BEING THERE. I DID'NT ¥
GLUNTEER IT, CERTAINLY. BUT IT WAS A PART OF THE EVIDENCE THAT NAS SUBMITTED To THE CO
MITTEE. AND THERE WAS REALLY NO REASON TO SAY THAT IT WAS SO HIGHLY CLASSIFIED THE I
T COULD NOT BE EXPOSED. SCHORR: MR. COLBY. AS ONE GETS AROUND THIS COUNTRY, ONE FINDS
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WILL HOT GO AWAY IS THE POPULAR MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE
ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY. I GUESS YOU’VE RUN INTO THAT. AND TIME AND TIME A
GRIN, PEGPLE ASK NE, AND IT GUESS THEY’ VE ASKED YOU, -DID THE CIA DO IT?- I SAID -AS FA
R AS 1 KNOW, THE CIA HAD NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION OR AN
CONSPIRACY IN THIS COUNTRY AGAINST ANY AMERICAN PUBLIC FIGURE. - BUT.. COLBY: CORRECT

SR3 oh vt ie

L3 DAN RATHER: SOME CRITICS-OF THE WARREN REPORT BELIEVE OSWALD WAS TRAINED AS A-SPY ti
HILE IN THE MARINE CORPS AND WAS TAUGHT THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE IN ANTICIPATION OF BEING
SENT TO RUSSIA. “WILLIAM COLBY, THE PRESENT DIRECTOR OF THE CIA, SAYS: THAT IS)NOT TRUE.
DIRECTOR COLBY."DID. THE CIA RECRUIT LEE HARVEY OSWALD. WHEN. HE WAS -IN>THE MARINES AND
SEND HIM TO RUSSIA? ‘COLBY: NO. WE HAD. NO CONTACT WITH MR. OSWALD. “RATHER: NO. CONTACT B
EFORE HE WENT TO. THE SOVIET UNION? COLBY: NO CONTACT WITH HIM BEFORE. HE WENT TO ‘THE SO
VIET UNION, NO CONTACT WITH HIN AFTER HE RETURNED FROM THE SOVIET UNION,.NO CONTACT WI
TH HIM WHILE-HE WAS IN THE SOVIET UNION. RATHER: DID ANYONE. WITH THE CIA -DEBRIEF OSWAL
D WHEN HE RETURNED TG THIS COUNTRY? COLBY: NO, THE CIA OID NOT DEBRIEF HIM. .I-THINK TH
ERE ARE SOME UNCLASSIFIED, OR DECLASSIFIED, REPORTS OF FBI DEBRIEFINGS, BUT |THE CIA OI
O NOT DEGRIEF HIM. RATHER: I SAY TO YOU, AS I HAVE BEFORE, THAT THAT’S DIFFICULT FOR MM
ANY PEOPLE,.AND, IN ALL CANDOR, DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BELIEVE: THAT A YOUNG MAN IN THE
ARINES GETS OUT OF THE MARINES, GOES TO THE SOVIET UNION, MARRIES A RUSSIAN WOMAN, MOY
ES BACK TO THIS COUNTRY, COMES BACK INTO THIS SOCIETY: AND IT IS. DIFFICULT. TO BELIEVE
THAT THE CIA DID NOT, UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, DEBRIEF HIM. COLBY:. RIGHT. WELL, 1 THI
NK =- I- UNDERSTAND YOUR: DOUBT ON THIS QUESTION. “I THINK YOU HAVE.TO. LOOK AT THE CIRCUM
STANCES. MR... OSWALD WAS WHAT CAN BE CALLED.A DEFECTOR: TO THE SOVIET’ UNION. WE DID HAVE
A REPORT ON MR. OSWALD, WHICH THE FBI GAYE TO 'US, ABOUT IT.. WE-ALSO RECEIVED S¢m= ier
ERIAL FROMTHE EMBASSY IN MOSCOW ABOUT MR: OSWALD, WHEN HE TRIED TO DISCLAIM. H: Cliie
ENSHIP. WE HAD A LITTLE. FILE, THEREFORE, ON MR. OSWALD, WHICH CONSISTED OF THE TWO REP
ORTS FROM THE FBI, THE THO REPORTS FROM THE EMBASSY IN MOSCOW, AND ONE REPORT. FROM THE
DEPARMENT OF NAVY ~= THE MARINES, I THINK IT WAS ~~ INDICATING SOME EXCHANGE BETWEEN

THEM. THAT’S ALL WE HAD UNTIL ROUGHLY OCTOBER OF 4963. RATHER: DURING HIS VISIT TO MEX
ICO IN SEPTEMBER 1963, YOU HAD OSWALD UNDER SURVEILLANCE AT BOTH THE RUSSIAN AND CUBAN
EMBASSIES? COLBY: NO. NO, NO. WE DID NOT HAVE HIM UNDER SURVEILLANCE, WE BECAME AWARE
OF A CONTACT HE MADE WITH EACH OF THOSE EMBASSIES. RATHER: DID YOU MAKE VOICE RECORDI
NGS OF HIM? COLBY:.-I THINK THERE WERE, YES. RATHER: WHY WAS THE WARREN COMMISSION GIVE
NA PHOTOGRAPH OF ANOTHER MAN AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY, WRONGLY IDENTIFIED AS LEE HARVEY 0
SWALD? COLBY: WELL: IT WASN’T WRONGLY IDENTIFIED AS LEE HARVEY OSWALD. WE KNEW THAT HE
WAS IN THESE EMBASSIES AT A CERTAIN DAY, AND WE LOOKED AT THE CAPABILITY WE'HAD TO PH
OTOGRAPH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE CITY. AND WE LOOKED AT ~- THROUGH THE PHOTOGRAPHS, HOPT
NG_THAT WE COULD FIND, . PERHAPS, A PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM AS HE CAME’ IN OR WENT OUT REO
F THESE EMBASSIES. WE DID FOCUS ON ONE WHICH WE THOUGHT MIGHT BE HIM, AND THIS: 1:: pat
WN UP TO DALLA, LABELED -AN UNIDENTIFIED WHITE MALE. - THAT WAS TRE IDENTIFICATION GF T
T. BUT IT WAS FLOWN UP IN. CASE IT COULD BE HELPFUL AT THAT TIME. BUT THERE WAS KOT 4 P
HOTOGRAPH RONGLY LABELED. IT TURNED GUT NOT TO BE MR. OSWALD, CLEARLY. AND WE, 15 THI

E OR EXTREMIST GROUPS, EITHER DOMESTIC OR FOREIGN, WHO NIGHT FEEL CALLED UPON TO. TAKE
SOME SUCH ACTION AGAINST THESE PEOPLE. I AM. CONCERNED BECAUSE THE TESTIMONY GIVEN-IN 7
HE SENATE COMMITTEE WAS GIVEN WITH MY FULL ENDORSEMENT AND SUPPORT.. WE WAIVED THE SECR
ECY AGREEMENTS THAT APPLIED TO OUR EMPLOYEES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE PROVIDED LARGE AMOUNTS 0
F DOCUMENTATION TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE SO THAT THEY WOULD SE FULLY INFORMED! ON THESE
EVENTS. THE PEGPLE WHO DID TESTIFY, I BELIEVE IN GOOD FAITH, ANTICIPATED THAT THEIR EX
ECUTIVE SESSION TESTIMONY WOULD NOT BE FOLLOWED BY THEIR EXPOSURE FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL
ACTIVITIES. I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE BE SOME FEELING.THAT THERE BE AN OBLIGATION TO
REVEAL THESE. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE THERE IS SOME DISAPPROVAL OF THEM. THIS DISAPPROVAL, 0
F COURSE, IS SHARED BY MANY OF US. THE PRESIDENT HAS EXPRESSED HIS CLEAR POLICY AGHINS
TURNY SUCH ACTIVITY. I HAVE ISSUED DIRECTIVES IN THIS AGENCY. THO YEARS AGO WHICH CLEAR
LY PROHIBIT ANY INVOLVEMENT IN ASSASSINATION ACTIVITY, SO THERE’S REALLY NO QUESTION A
BOUT WHETHER THIS IS GOOD OR BAD. IT 15 BAD. THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER\WE WILL IMPO
SEAN EXTRA LEGAL RETALIATION ON PEOPLE WHO AT ONE TIME DID MHAT THE GENERAL. CONSENSUS.
OF THE PEOPLE AND THE COMMAND STRUCTURE AROUND THEM THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE AT THE TI
ME. I BELIEVE THAT, IF THERE IS DIAPPROVAL OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THERE ARE VEHICLES BY
WHICH ME CAN TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY DO NOT RECUR. THERE ARE ALSO VEHICLES BY W
HICH ANY PARTICULAR PUNISHMENT COULD BE METED OUT ACCORDING TO THE LAW, BUT I THINK TH
AT THE EXTRA LEGAL, EX POST FACTO EXPOSURE OF OUR PEOPLE TO HOSTILE AND IRRATIONAL RET

ALIATION IS NOT WITHIN THE TRADITION OF OUR COUNTRY AND, CERTAINLY, IS TOO MUCH TO EXP *

ECT OF PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTARILY ACCEPTED THE LIMITATIONS OF LIVES OF ANONYMITY AND SERVI

NGERNS HE 1S THE COMMITTEE RULE ON THIS SUBJECT HHICH SAYS THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO BEL
TEVES HIMSEL

THAT YOU ARE MAKING THIS APPEAL? NR, COLBY: YES. QUESTION: WHAT SORT OF ACTIONS ARE AT
TACHED TO THESE NAMES? WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT--MURDER, OR...? MR. COLBY: I’M NOT Go

INVOLVED IN, THAT THEY WERE ACTING AT THE DIRECTION OF THE MHITE HOUSE? IS THAT YOUR
POSITION--OR WILL YOU GIVE A POSITION? MR. COLBY: I REALLY AM NOT TOTALLY INFORMED ON
THAT. THE COMMITTEE HAS CONDUCTED AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION IN WHICH THEY’ VE LOOKED
INTO A LOT OF THINGS OUTSIDE OF CIA, SO I’M SURE THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE PTCTIRE
IS LARGER THAN THAT AVAILABLE TO ME, AND I BELIEVE THAT THE RECORD.IN CIA IS, i

SION OF THE COMMITTEE? MR. COLBY: NO, I DION’T ASK HIM THAT. WAS ONLY INTERESTED. IN
SECURITY PROBLEMS THAT WERE INVOLVED. THAT’S WHAT WE WERE INVITED TO LOOK AT, THAT WAS
THE PROBLEM THAT I FELT I WAS ASKED BY THE SENATE TO MAKE-A JUDGMENT ABOUT, AND I DID
TWAS NOT ASKED TO REVIEW THE ACCURACY OR NONACCURACY: OF THEIR CONCLUSIONS, OF THEIR
ASSESSMENTS. OF THEIR DETAILED REPORTS. QUESTION: IF I COULD FOLLOW-UP 'FOR JUST A SEC

N CASES, YES.:.-TO-FIND OUT WHAT THE ORIGIN OF: :

YOU _NOT SIMPLY TOLD THE SENATE COMMITTEE THEY CAN’ T RELEASE INFORMATION. THAT YOU HAVE

THE ROCKEFELLER COMMISSION INVESTIGATION WAS SENT UP THERE WITH THE STATEMENT THAT IT
WOULD BE HANDLED INA RESPONSIBLE MANNER BY THE SENATE. THERE..WAS NOT:-A. LEGAL.POSITIO

THERE HAS BEEN A NEED TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF BRINGING AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE CLEA
RLY UNDER AMERICA’S CONSTITUTION AND LEGAL SYSTEM. I THINK THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPT OF
INTELLIGENCE WAS THAT SOMEHOW IT WAS OUTSIDE OF LAW, IT REALLY DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING MU
CH TO 00 WITH LAW, AND IT SOMEHOW WAS SOMETHING THAT NATIONS DID BUT DIDN'T. TALI: m39UT
~ WELL, THAT’S NO GOOD FOR ANERICA. WE EXPECT OUR GOVERNMENT TO WORK UNDER. THE
D UNDER THE CONSTITUTION, AND. WE’VE BEEN IN THE PROCESS. OF DEMONSTRATING THAT \~

@NKLY. BUT THEN WE NENT. THROUGH SIX MONTHS OF EXCITEMENT WITH ALL SORTS OF ACCU: i

AND SENSATIONALISN, AND I THINK. THE NORMAL CITIZEN IS INCLINED TO THINK THAT I SPEND.
MY DAY IN THIS OFFICE PLOTTING ASSASSINATIONS. WELL, THE ACTUAL FINDING OF THE COMMITT
EE WAS REALLY QUITE REVEALING, BECAUSE IT INDICATED THAT THIS AGENCY, IN THE LAST 25 ¥
EARS, DID GO OUT TO TRY TO BRING ABOUT THE END OF THE LIFE OF TWO INDIVIDUALS, NEITHER
OF WHOM DIED AS A RESULT. OF THAT EFFORT. THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WHO’VE BEEN KILLED I
N THE PROCESS OF OPERATIONS, CERTAINLY; THERE ARE OUR OWN OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLE
D, THERE ARE FOREIGNERS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE COURSE OF REVOLUTIONS AND COUPS, T
HINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT THERE HAVENT BEEN ANY ASSASSINATIONS CONDUCTED BY THIS AGEN
C¥. SCHORR: BUT THEY TRIED. DIRECTOR COLBY: THERE WERE TWO SITUATIONS IN WHICH CLEARLY
THIS PARTICULAR REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE WERE STEPS TAKEN HERE TO BRING THIS AEQUT
. [BUT THEY DIDN?T HAPPEN. AND, YOU KNOW, OVER 25 YEARS, TO SAY THAT THAT CHARACTERIZES
THE WORK OF THE AGENCY I THINK IS JUST PLAIN WRONG. AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEGPLE A
RE GOING TO SEE THROUGH THE SENSATIONAL TREATMENT TO THE REALITY IHAT’S UNDERNEATH IT
WHEN THEY GET A SERIOUS ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THE FACTS ACTUALLY WERE. SCHORR: ARE THERE
PEOPLE WHO DON’T WANT YOU TO CLEAN UP YOUR SHOP BECAUSE THEYRE AFRAID OF THE CHAIN RE
ACTION WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR. CAREERS? DIRECTOR COLBY: OH, I DON’T -- I°VE NEVER HEARD
OF ANY SUGGESTION TO THAT EFFECT, NO. NO, I THINK THAT ANY DIFFERENCES THAT MAY HAVE
EXISTED IN HGW TO HANDLE THIS WHOLE INVESTIGATION SITUATION WERE GOOD-FAITH DIFFERENCE

SERVE THE COUNTRY IN

HE BEST NAY IT CAN. SCHORR: YOU SAID THAT YOU NEVER ORDERED ANY ASSASSINATION AND THAT
YOU WERE NEVER PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN ANY OF THOSE PLANS FOR ASSASSINATION. YET. ARE
VOU SAVING THAT NONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WAS ENOUGH TO OUTRAGE YOU? DIRECTOR c
OLBY: NO, I DON’T THINK’ SO -~ THE ONES THAT I KNEW OF. I DIDN’TKNOH- ANYTHING ABOUT TH
GSE TWO CASES I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT AT. THE TIME. I INDICATED THAT WHEN I” DISCOVERED
THEM, THEY WERE:LONG IN THE PAST: THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD BEEN THE SUBJECT OF DIRECTIVES TH

OF DISCLOSURE HAS PROBABLY ABOUT RUN ITS COURSE, AND YET THERE IS A RESIDUE OF QUESTI
ONS. SOME, LIKE CHARLES COLSON, CONTINUE SUGGESTING THAT THERE WAS A. SORT OF A CONSPIR
ACY IN THE CIA AGAINST THE NIXON HHITE HOUSE, THAT THE CIA.PLAYED SOME PART IN GRINGIN
G DOWN NIXON. ANY TRUTH? DIRECTOR COL8Y: ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS AGENCY HAS, IF’ ANYTHING
=~ I THINK THE RECORD SHOWS VERY CLEARLY THAT, IF ANYTHING, IT’S TOO LOVAL AND TOO RES
PONSIVE TO\PAST PRESIDENTS, THAT IT IS PRECISELY RESPONSIVENESS TO PRESIDENTS. THAT IN
SOME CASES TODAY IS NOW CRITICIZED, WHERE WE HAVE REACTED. I THINK GIVING THE RED NIG;
TO-MR. HUNT WAS. AN EXAMPLE OF RESPONDING TO WHAT SEEMED TO BE A WHITE ‘HOUSE, . PRESIDENT
IRLLY-SPONSORED, REQUEST. AND. WE SHOULDN’T. HAVE DONE IT, AND LATER-WE WITHDREW FROM. IT
+ AS SOON.AS WE.SAW THE DEPTH TO WHICH IT SEEMED TO BE GOING. BUT ABSOLUTELY NOT, NO.
THERE*S NO CONNECTION IN THIS AGENCY WITH ANY CONSPIRACY AGAINST MR. “NIXON. WE EBSOLUT
ELY HAD NOTHING TO DO MITH THE ASSASSINATION OF. PRESIDENT KENNEDY. “I THINK THAT. IK A
WAY, THE CIA HAS BEEN, ‘INDEED, THE SCAPEGOAT OF MANY THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. fio 1 ¢
THINK, STATISTICALLY, - YOU CAN FIND THAT THE ABUSES BY THE CIA FREQUENTLY. LEAD-THE HEAD
LINE, AND THEN LATER WE FIND THAT THERE ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE OR THAT THIS WAS REALLY
A SMALL PORTION. SCHORR: IF YOU HAD TO PROJECT, WHAT MOULD YOU SEE THIS AGENCY, OR UND

FOR EXAMPLE, COLBY CITED NEMS PHOTOS OF SEN. FRANK CHURCH, THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIA
L_ASPIRANT FROM IDAHO WHO SERVED AS SENTATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, HOLDING A
DART GUN DESIGNED BY CIA WERPONS TECHNICIANS. QUOTE THE GUN WAS NEVER USED, UNQUOTE C

CIA. THE ROCKEFELLER COMMISSION CONDUCTED A FOUR-MONTH INVESTIGATION. AND IT FOUND TH
AT MOST OF THE THINGS WE DID WERE PERFECTLY PROPER. SOME OF THE THINGS WE DID BECAUSE
THE PRESIDENT TOLD US TO. THERE WAS A QUESTIONABLE GRAY AREA. AND SOME OF THE THINGS W
E DID WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE. NE SHOULDNT HAVE OPENED MAIL. BUT REMEMBER, THAT PROGR
AN WAS STARTED IN 4953 IN THE MIDST OF THE COLD WAR, WHEN RUSSIA WAS A CLEARLY DEFINED
THREAT AND WE MONITORED MAIL TO AND FROM THE SOVIET UNION. THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN SEN
SATIONALIZED AND THEY HAVE OBSCURED THE REAL NATURE OF AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE. IT IS TH

LL FIND THAT WE ESSENTIALLY HAD THREE AGENTS WHO DID THINGS THAT THEY SHOULDN’T HAVE.

WELL, THAT’S HARDLY A MASSIVE ACTIVITY. THE ASSASSINATION REPORT: AFTER SIX MONTHS OF

S, WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF ITS INQUIRY. AND WHICH WA a .

S THE SUBJECT OF SENSATIONAL CHARGES ABOUT "A YEAR AGO, WHICH GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT

CIA WAS ENGAGED IN MASSIVE ILLEGAL DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITY. I THINK THE FACTS O
F_THE ROCKEFELLER COMMISSION REPORT WERE THAT IT WASN’T MASSIVE AND. JT WASN’T ILLEGAL,
THAT SOME OF THE THINGS WERE WRONG, SOME FEW OF THEM, BUT IT CERTAINLY. COULN“T BE CHA
RACTERIZED IN THAT FASHION. DUKE: WASN’T.. COLBY: THE SUBJECT OF ASSASSINATION, OF COU

URTHER INVESTIGATION. AND IN THE SENATE’S FULL INVESTIGATION -~ AND WE COOPERATED 120

PER CENT WITH THEM ON THIS. I THINK IF YOULL READ THAT REPORT ALSO, YOU WILL FIND THA
T WHAT THEY FOUND AFTER SIX MONTHS OF VERY INTENSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT CIA DID,

THAT THEY FIND FIVE CASES, WHICH THEY MENTIONED. TWO CASES IN WHICH CIA, THEY SAY, DID
MAKE SOME STEPS TOWARD THE KILLING OF THESE INDIVIOUALS, NEITHER OF WHOM DIED f5 fi RE
SULT OF THOSE STEPS. THERE WERE SOME OTHER STEPS ~~ THERE WERE SOME OTHER PEOPLF ‘Vo W
ERE KILLED ELSEWHERE AS A PART OF ACTIVITY THAT OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRICS ERT

BECAUSE THEY WERE BELIEVED TO BE RIGHT OR WITHIN.THE COLOR OF THE LAW. THERE IS A JUS

I HAVE NO QUESTION ABOUT. THAT. CERTAINLY IT SHOULD NOT BE DONE, EXCEPT. IN TIME OF WAR

THER DAY THAT. THE CIA HAS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. SITTING AROUND, DREAMING UP. SUBVERSIVE AC
