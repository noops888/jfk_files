in either place, (4 :

Mrs. SWEAZY stated that in her opinion SAM GIANCANA
is a "perfect gentleman" and is being unduly harrassed by the
various law enforcement agencies. She said that GIANCANA
has told her that he is a "retired gambler" and that she is
inclined to believe his statement. She said that she does
not believe GIANCANA is a mobster as disclosed by newspaper
articles and that if she did believe this she would no longer
associate with him. Mrs. SWEAZY added that GIANCANA at the

time was "out of town" but declined to state exactly where
he may be, w)

PCI GLADYS EBLE advised SA HILL on 2/8/61 that

GIANCANA was on that date at the Armory Lounge in Forest Park,
Ill.

ACCARDO brought up the fact that it was foolish for GIANCANA
to hold meetings at the Armory Lounge in view of the fact
the police have been known to conduct surveillances on a
regular basis re the syndicate. (4d
