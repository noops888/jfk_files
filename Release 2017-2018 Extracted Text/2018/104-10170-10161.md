memorandum to Mr.

3. In April 1967 the undersigned showed a copy of the Thomas

then C/WH/COG, who considered

nevertheless, that the charges which District Altorney James Garrison

was then beginning to lovel againet anti-Castro Cubana and this Agency

necessitated careful checking.

4.. The firet report in the Cl/R&A serlea on Garrison, 26 April

1967, listed seven Cuban refugees then linked to the case (Serglo

ARCACHA Smith. Carlos BRINGUIER, Julio BUZNEDO, Manuel GARCIA

Gonzalez, Pascial GONGORA, Miguel Silva TORRES, and Carlos

QUIROGA.) It requested any additional WH/COG information about them

Front, the DRE, the Information Council of the Americas, and any othar

anti-Castro groups active la the New Orleans area. The request added,

"Information about CIA relationships with the above-named groups should

not be restricted to New Orleans but should also include Miant and other.

areaß зo which Garrison's Investigations may lead.". Information was

?. The problem artsing (roin Garrion's charges of Agency

Involvement in the assassination is compounded by the nature of

some of our former Cuban operations, which resulted in a form of

Indirect assoclation. For example, Carrioon has sought without.

success to extradite Serglo ARCACHA Smith from Dallas. FBI reporting

o1 28 March 1967 stated that according to Layton Patrick Martene,

Carrioon will try to prove that Arcacha was the "second trigger man"

in the assassination.. The checks run by WH/COG and CI/R&A have not

hown any link between Arcacha and CLA. However, WH/COQ hae

reported that Alcacha was the delegate of the Frente Revolucionario

Democratico (FRD) La New Orleans before the Bay of Pigs, that he

maintained regular postal contact with FRD headquarters in Miami.

that the FRD and the Cuban Revolutionary Council were supported by

CIA, and that funde were supplied to the head of these groups, Dr. Jose

MIRO Cardona. Consequently Arcacha may have belleved that hia :

activitles in New Orleans were ClA-supported. This phenomenon of

indirect asociation appeare in other cases as well and may well underlie

some of Garrison's accucationa. '

8. It la suggested that C/WH or his representative might

proiltably query Mr. Thomas about the allegationa summarized in

paragraph 1, above. Although the date for the trial of Clay Shaw has

not been set, it lo plainly drawing eloser., Once It starts, the newspapers

will carry a flood of accusations, old and new; and it would be judicious

to be prepared in advance.
