‘Allegations of Involvement, CIA and Cuban {

$B Division wrote 5 memorandum

entitled “Possible DRE Animus Toward President Kennedy" and dated

6 March 1967. At that thme Mr. Thomas had recently returned from a
tour of duty in Yugoslavia. While there he had read about the Warren
Commission’ investigation and had noted the pre-sssascination encounter
in New Orleans between Carlos Bringuler of the Student Revolutionary
Directorate (DRE) and Lee Harvey Oswald, He vecalled his own dealings
in Miarni with the DRE, 2 ClA-subsidized group. He considered the
DRE inernbers whorn he knew to be unpredictable and untrustworthy. He
speculated.as to whether DRE elements could have been involved in the
Kennedy essassination. He recommended that CIA investigate this

i posaibility if it had not already done 60- Thomas wae assigned to Miami
from July 1962 to August 1963. Neither CIU/R&A nor SB has a retention
copy of the raemorandum, but Mr. Thomas is still at Headquarters.

2. Mr. Arthur Dooley of CI/R&A discussed this matter with the

following znembers of WH/COG:

a. Mise Margaret Forsythe. She stated that CLA's
interest in the DRE had been made known to the office of the
‘Attorney General by letters of 9 January and 18 April 1993
addressed te J+ Walter Yeagley. The earlier letter said, in

part, “The DRE Ie of interest to this Agency witch sponsors
ead supporte ite propaganda and intelligence collection activity
‘as the DRE ie not a group

in the Western Hemisphere - - -
the above docs not insure that

under cormplete Agency control,
they will not undertake leclated paramilitary operations without

‘ prior notification."

Hl b. Messer: en recently returned H
from a tour of the a ony aneCarl Trettin, DC of the ~

Cf Branch; WH/COG, who knew Bringuier and was stationed



oa |

in New Orleans at the time of the Oswald-Bringuier
: confrontations in August 1963. It was concluded that l i‘
Oswald was never a member of the DRE, which in fact fob :
rejected Rim, and that the DRE was not involved in the

; assassination.
ood 3. h'Aprit t ‘signed showed a copy of the Thomas cat
tay memorandum to Mr. ‘then C/WH/COG, who considered
: that it reflected inadequr YMation and bias. It was agreed,

a neverthelesa, that the charges which District Attorney James Garrison
was then beginning to level against anti-Castro Cubans.and this Agency e
necessitated careful checking.

4. The first report in the CI/R&A series on Garrison, 26 April
1967, listed seven Cuban refugees then linked to the case (Sergio i
ARCACHA Smith, Carlos BRINGUIER, Julio BUZNEDO, Manuel GARCIA Hl
Gonzalez, Pascual GONGORA, Miguel Silva TORRES, and Carlos \
QUIROGA.) It requested any additional WH/GOG information about them
: and about the following groups: the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary
H Front, the DRE, the Information Council of the Americas, and any other
antl-Castro groups active in the New Orteans'area. The request added,
i “Information about CIA relationships with the above-named groups should
HE not be restricted to.New Orleans but should also include Miami and other, Hy
areas to which Garrison's investigations may lead." Information was i
also requested on Edward'S, BUTLER, Alberto FOWLER, Emilio |
SANTANA, and a parainilitary training site at Lake Pontchartrain. B. H

: °. forwarded on 8 May 1967 the then AC/WH/COG, Mr, i
i Cen provid the requested information and added, "WH/COG :
atau to review all material that may contain information pertinent

ubject and will forward such information to CURKA ona priority

: : 5. Since that date CI/R&A bas prepared a series of reports on
the Garrison case, All of these have been forwarded to WH/COG. In
turn, \WH/COG has provided additional information from ite own files
and those of the Miami Station, to which It has addressed several inquiries.

6. CI/R&A to currently compiling a separate list of all Cubans
{as well ag other Latin Americans) whose names have been linked to the
Garrison investigation. This Het will be forwarded to WH/COG with a
Fequest for checks if it contains any Identities not previously traced
against their files (including those of JMWAVE),

7. The problem arising from Garrison's charges of Agency
involvement in the assassination is compounded by the ‘nature of
some of:our former Cuban operations, which resulted in a'form of
indirect association. ‘For example, Garrison has sought without
success to extradite Sergio.ARCACHA Smith froni Dallas. - FBI reporting
of 28:March 1967.stated: that according to Layton Patrick Martens,
Garrison will try:to prove'that Arcacha was the "second trigger. man”

‘in the assassination. The checks run by WH/COG and CI/R&A have not

shown any link bétween Arcacha and CIA. However, WH/COG hae
reported that Akcacha'was the delegate of the Frente Revolucionario
Democrati¢o (FRD) in New.Orleans before the Bay of Pige, that he
maintainéd regular postal contact with FRD headquarters in Miami,

that the FRD and the Cubaa Revolutionary Council were supported by
CIA, and-that-fands were supplied to the head of these groups, Dr.Jose
MIRO Gardona. ‘Consequently Arcacha may have-belleved that his
activities in New-Orleans were ClA-supported. This phenomenon of
indirect association appears in other cases as well and may well undérlie
some of Garrison's accusations.

8. It is suggested that C/WH or his. representative might
profitably query Mr. Thomas about the allegations summarized in
paragraph 1, above. Although the date for the trial of Clay Shaw has
not been it'la plainly drawing closer: Once it. starts, the newspapers
will carry a flood of accusations, old-and new; and it would be judicious
to be. prepared in advance.
