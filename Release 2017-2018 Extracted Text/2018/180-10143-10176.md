II. John Wilson Hudson File

A review of Hudson's CIA DDO file indicates’ that in'a report

from Jaatea August 8, 1957 or 1951 a source

was of the opinion that "Wilson was very probably an intelligence

agent and that he is under direction of some service."

(Report from! ——~—~SS~S™~«*S August 8, 1951,or 1957) On

October 6, 1959, a memorandum for the record reported that
Hudson was. arrested with Paul Hugues in Cuba and that

{ Wilson may be summarized as a
person of intelligence, but so
erratic as to be considered
mentally unbalanced at :
time. He is a soldier of. fortune, having et
begun his career. in July 1936 when he left
Oxford to fight in Spain. He has been
accused of working for the intelligence
services of several countries, and he
himself has claimed to have acted on
behalf of different intelligence services.
He has been consistently anti-United States.

(Memo for the record 6 Oct. 1959, subj: "Carl John Wilson
Hudson.)

A 201 file request was submitted from ion October

29, 1959. (201 File Request, from[ WH/T/Chile,)10/29/59)
Handwritten at the bottem of this request is the statement
"In contact with suspected Soviet Agents." (Ibid.)

The neSt file reference is in a cable dated December
19, 1959 from Havana to the Director of the CIA which states

that in Ref B (HAVA 2296) Havana station reported that

Wilson. (Cable, 19 Dec 1959, To Dir from Havana, HAVA 3072)

On August 1959 Wilson walked

into the U.S. Consulate, Kingston,
Jamaica, and said. he was a journalist
who had just been released after 54

days detention in Habana prison...

On 21 August 1959 the U.S. Consulate in
Kingston issued a single entry non-
immigrant visa. He was carrying passport
147356 issued in Habana 14 August in the name
of John Wilson. He was attempting to get
air passage to Miami in order to sell his


his story to the Miami Herald
and then to obtain a new visa from
Chilean consulate to return home.

The last entry in the file was a memorandum of a conversation

between Wilson and the First Secretary of the American Embassy
in.London, dated April 7, 1964. (Memo of Conversation between
Wilson and Richard A. Ericson, Jr., 4/7/64, London, Subj:

"Interest of Carl J,.,Wilson “Hudson in POlitical Intelligence")

Wilson indicated he had come to England early in the fall on
- . business, but was planning to return to Chile. (Ibid.) The
comment made at the end of this report states

This is the second time Wilson has
approached me to.show an interest
in intelligence matters. The first
: time was shortly after President

Kennedy was assassinated, when he

a said that he had been imprisoned in
Havana by Castro in 1959. He alleged
that’ while he was in prison, meals
for a fellow-prisoner, a former
gambling czar in Havana with early
associations with the Capone gang, had
been brought to the prison by a man
who identified himself as “Ruby" and who
bore a physical resemblence to the
man being tried for Oswlad's murder.

(Ibid.)
The Commitee has been provided with no evidence
to indicate any further“ investigation was conducted by

the CIA with regard to Wilson Hudson.
