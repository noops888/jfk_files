1. Transmitted nerewith are the following:

A,” A five~page report of 3OCDINSs interrogation of Harry Alfons
SU:DVIK on 25 April 1961

B, A two-page meorandum from SXDVIK covering jeints ne had forgotten
during the interrozation E

2. When reading the attached interrogation report, there are a nuubar
of points to be noted, First of all, 5. .O¢.k's first story wis a lie and it
was only wien he wis pressed ty ROODINS tuat he xade any Wa::tion of his meetings:
with KLIWOV., Therefore, this story could be only tie sscund line of defense
and not a true story of their relationship. Second, ths stery does not attaspt
to explain why, when SuNvVIK had a weex off frou work (froa Seuurday, 8 april
to Sunday, 16 Appil),he only spent the four -iddle days ca his trip instead
of utilizing the rest of his time. Third, wy aLInOV persisted until the last
moment and made arrangements to sea SUNDLIX again socially in aelsinki if le
had really "lost his grip™ to SUNOVIK's superior arguuents and hostile attitude
as SUNDVIK states. Anyway, to say the least, we are not reacy to accept SUNUVI&'
story as it stands, “e sas beon asked to write out in detail, at least five
single-space typewritten paces, the history of his contacts with KLINOV. We
will check this paper against the report in hand, for a sturteore

3. VALINK/6 is being kept informed of the details of this case, He
agrees with ROOD that tere is a good dail more than has been revealed so
far. (By the way, wo might mention that this is another casa in which VaLIIK/é
and the help of the VALINK organization have teen invaluable, They nave provided
full background reports on all concerned, and hava been surveilling SUUDVIK
off und on ever 4 we expressed our interesc in him)

ae &. Ae far as KLIMOV's statements atout COSTILLE a:d 2OCDINE go this

© was only to be exp.ced and does not surcrise either of tha. For the history

* “of COSTILLE's previous encounters with KLTV, see (ria, 20 barch 1962,
ROODINE MEXXYEY has never mst KLINOV. 35

5. The Ambassador, the Counselor, tae Sscurity Offleer and the Genaral
Services Officer (SUNDVIK's imnediate boss) are aware of this case. The inter.
rogation took place .in the Security Ufficer's office, (nly sCODINS and 3U..DVIK
were present, but FURSIVSS was in tie adjoining office Listening through the
wall,

6. We still have not figured out exactly low te handle this case. SUDVIK
will eventually to dismissed, but we would like to yet suze mere information
before we let yo of by Anyway, since ha sag taun workin: ab the dubassy
since 1449 there is not such to be gained by throwing Aim out toworrow, ‘ie
has volunteered that he will be seving KLIWV in the next raw daya to collett
tho bottle of vodia mentioned on page five of Attachment a, and we would Like

wiloh he propared by himself.) One thing wa do Antend be suqest,: and
