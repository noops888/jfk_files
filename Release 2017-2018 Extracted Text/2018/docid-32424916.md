means can be used to bestir sharp criti-

cism by Brazilian workers and farmers

of Castro's betrayal of Cuba's revolution.

Tours of Cuban exiles of stature can

bear telling witness to the dangers of

Communism to Brazil and the shame of

condoning betrayal of the Cuban people:

The special film alerting Brazil to danger,

with its religious message, should be re-

played: labor audience films, atrengthened

by moral of the story in today's events,

should be used to provoke sober thought

and pressure on the government to "'break

with Castro now.'' Ultimate lose of Habana

embassy is greatly outweighed by psycho -

logical value at this time, inpairing Castro'e

power over the people and his machine

cadre.

PURPOSE

TASK

PSYCHOLOGICAL = continued

Intensify psychological effort

at Guantanamo. (DEFENSE)

To make fullest possible use of

the existing Cuban labor population

CONSIDERATIONS

Activities include sports broadcasts,

in Spanish, over the base radio station

on ball games, news broadcaste using

regular wire service news, and making

Spanish -language periodicals and litera-

ture available for reading on base.

USIA has a number of selected titles,

published in Mexico and Rio, for stocking

base libraries. Also, USIA has a number

of VOA "backgrounders" and refugee inter-

views on tape which could be used for

radio broadcasts to Cuban employees on

the base.

New words to a favorite song, a new tune,

a visual symbol for wall-painting, a hand

symbol as easy to do as "V for Victory,"

are the types of expressions sought. USIA

should call on ClA for assistance, since

some thought has been given to this already.

To assure that skills needed for

guerrilla operations are present

inside Cuba,

so that paramilitary

actions can be initiated when the

decision is made.

CONSIDERATIONS

Since the Air Force has readied a

capability for this task and since it

is still desired that Clamount such

operations with Cuban/or. Latin American

personnel, an acceptable means must be

found promptly:

CLA, with Defense assig

tance, as a priority will review feasible

means of mounting these operations, and

recommend the mome

stical method

for a policy decision.

While CLA is currently carrying out

this task, it is worth ClA taking a further

hard look at its training program to anti-

cipate needs. Iflarger groups of action

types are to be trained for possible intro-

duction in September, it is known that at

least 3 months "lead time' is required

for minimum selection and training. That

means now, It is possible that Defense

can be of far more help than called upon

at present. Also, it is possible that further

policy guidance might be required.
