The story provided by Subjeat during our Interview at the United

States Consulate in Trieste on 25 Oatober 1905 concerning hia experiences

while in the Soviet Union 1e eusentially the same as that provided by Dr.

George Renninger in raference (a).

Although Subject was reasorably 0o-

operative, he was not as fully communloative as we wlight have desired. In

conaldering the various possible reagons

for his partial hesitanoe lt ap-

pears rather obvious now that our continued interest in what he interpreted

to be a very simplo relationship with a Sovlet girl has causad him to sue-

poot that posalbly ve are suapicious of him.

Acoording to Subjeot,

the

entire episode was reported fully while in Mosoon and again to KUSARK last

Christmas while he was on a vialt to

the United states.

Subject stated

that he lad prepared a report in writing for Dr. Goldberg at Prineston

University who aote as a & bethren for kuBark.

It is obvious that he was

probably asked to prepare a general report on his experienous while in the

Soviet Union for KULOOK which we had not been aware of previoualy and whieh

may not have come to the attention of KUDESK. Unlues Headquarters has some

rathor specifio questiona it in considered unlikuly that we oan provide any

Information in addition to that reported in the folloring paragrapha ob-

tained during this Intervier.

2o Jubject arrived in Moscow during the early part of November 1963

on a ter month exchange fellowship arranged botreen the National Academy

of Solonces and the Soviet Acadeny of Sciences.

Subject was assigned to

the Lebeder Physios Institute in Moscow and the major portion of his life

while In Moscow revolved around his work at the Inatitute or various in-

dividuals met through the Institute. Subject ate lunch in the Institute

lunch room or cafeteria and usually at about the same

time each day, some-

arrived at the Inatitute, subjest and his

who was at the Insiltute

ren' sonth excreme fellowship, were

approached by Vladiair Anatolarion SOKOLOVSKTY uhile walting lo the cate

teria 11ne. SOKCLOVSKIY, who identified himself as an American, said that

he had heard that they were in the Insultice and ranted to meet then. Dur-

Ing this first conversation Subjeot clairs that SO:CLOVSKIY told chen that

he was in faot Willlam Hanilton MARTIN and vent on to explain sone of the

supertiolal details surrinding nia delecion to she sovier Union in 190J.

MARTIN told them tnat if lney did not consider him coo tainted, he would

welcome the opportunity of talking to scoa hrarioans.

He felt that there

were many racets of his experiences while in the Soviet Union which he

would like to talk about but which he could not dississ with his Soviet

friends. Either on this ocoasion or later,. MARTIN sentloned shat Vernon

MITCHELL, who had defeated with MARTIN, bas living In Leningrad.

Approximately a week later SubJect net MARTDI again in the lunch

MARTIN reportal that lollowing ils firat encounter with Subjeet and

RENNINOER he had been called into the party offloe at the Inatitute. They

apologized to him for not having warned r.im in advanes that Subject and

RENNINGiR were boing assigned to the Institute, sinee they were certain

that subjeot would have wanted to avoid ther.

They cold MARTIN that it

was perfectly permisaible for him to talk to them, but that he should de.-

Initely not reveal his true identity to them nor should he give then his

address in Mosoow sinde there was the possibility that they had been sent

to the Soviet Union to assassinate him.

Quite naturally, they also wanted

to know what MAKTIl had disoussed v1uh Subjeot and NEININGER.

As a gonora!

rule, Subject saw MARTIN in the lunch room every week or two for the entire

parlod that he was in Mosoon. On oertain coasions it appeared that MAKTI!

would avold talking to Subjeat, Based on MATIN's aotlons, Subjeot assuned

this usually depended on who was prosent in the lunch room.

SubJeot addod

at this point that their disousalons with MARTIN were always in English.

# MARTIN made 1t definitely clear to Subjoot that he was intorested

in getting out of the Soviet Union.

He desoribed life in the USSR as a

constant game with the Soviet offlelals.

MARTIN felt that he had only been

able to keep his hoad above water while there because of his knowledge of

Soviot. lan.

Hu explained to Subjoot that he had devoted a great deal of

time studying Soviet lar and had used hie knowledge to proteot himself.

The Soviets were frequently at a lose when confronted with quotations from

their own laws in total confliot with aotions which they were tryina to

impose on MARTIN. Subjeot was once asked to write a letter to MARTIN' a

parents asking them to. put pressure on the Soviets and the Prese to help

in obtalning his relesse.

Subject sald .that-e copy of this letter nuat

be avallable at KUBARK.

5. MARTIN also desoribed in great detall to Subjeot 11fe In general

within the Soviet Union and what the averase Soviet citizen must fade every

day. It nas obvious to subjeat that MARTIN had been greatly dialllusioned

following his arrival in the USSR when he found a society totally different

from what he had antioipated prior to his departure from the United States.

The Soviets had exerted conaiderable presaure on Subjeot to partloipate in

various anti-US radio prograns or to write antl-US artiales.

disoussion back and forth MARTIN agreed to write something if they would

promise to publish it without editing.

He wrote what he considered a very

. objective comparison of life In the USSR and that in the U.S. After having

this artiole he was never approached again on this tople.

6.

Regular contacts between subjeat, RENNINAER and MARTIN continued

In the lunch room with general conversations such as those noted above un-

t1l December or early January, 1504.

At this point MARTIN asked Subject

If he or RENNINGER wauld. go to the U.S. Embassy to ask them 1f there were .

any way in which they could assist him in. leaving the Soviet Union legally

or otherwise.

Subjeet rated that' RENNINGER had already contacted the U.S.

Embassy following the firat meeting with MARTIN to report on their con

versations with him and the faot that he was in Moscow.

Alao at about ine same tine, probably aarly January, Subject was

standirug in the lunch roun line (Subjool alwaja roierred to

1t as

the lunoh

room rather than a cafeseria) when le saw MARTIN together with an attrac-

tive young firl about tranty or twentj-one years of age.

They stopped to

ohat for a lument and MARTIN introduced Alla Aleksandrovna ROLLOVA.

Subjeet

emphasized that this was entiraly casual and that their conversation at this

neting lanted "or only a few mosenbs.. A few days or possioly a week later

MARTIN saw jubJeot in the lunch room and bentioned that "Alla" had found

him quite a handsone individual. MARTIN seationed this ooly in passing and

in no way, an far aa Subjeot was conderned, auteupted to force "Alla" on sul-

foot.

Subject was equally impressed with

"Alla" and during the following

few daya made several inquirles anong ia Soviet colleagues in the Insti-

tute.

No one bad anything partioular to say about her otner than that she

was rather alive socially and had wany friends in the Institute. At this

point Subjeot did not know where she worked at the Institute.

Sometime during the latter part of January 19f4 S-bJest had his

first date with "Alla.'

Subjeat oouid not recall exaotly how this was ar

ranged, but belleves that he met her in the lunch room and asked her to go'

on a troike ride with him.

This was followed by five or sir other dates

with her ovor the next seven or eight weeks.

Trey went to a film ones, the

Bolsty ones, the upera onde and restaurante on two or three occasions.

Afler a while Subjeot notioed that she was partioularly interested

in his Soviet friends and other contacts in the Soviet Union.

For example,

on the evening they attorded the Bolahoy, Subjeat noticed hia friend william

(B111) PARRIS, an

Anerloan exchango atudent at the Moboow State Univeralty.

subject had known him at Princeton University.

Subjeot said,

"Oh, there 1s

"What did you say abuut SOKOLOVSKIY?" In other

words, she knew perfestly woll that SoKoLOVSKIY and Willia MAHTIN vere one

and the same. She was obvioualy embarrased and tried without sucoess to

oover up her blunder.

MARTIN later told Subjeat that "Alla" had oalled him

that evening to cell him of her blunder.

She also onoe asied Subjeot if te

were really going to return to the United Intes. This couid, of course, be

intorprotod as a defection pitoh. Suojeot feele that 1t was more of a

casual personzi. remarke

10.

Aooording to Subjeot, "Alla" seened to lum to be suah too friendly,

willo at the sane time not sinoerely friendly.

In February, Subjeat's. sus-

picions had mounted to the point where he desided to ask his Soviet 0o1

league in the Institute, Ilja ROYZIN (phonetio), 1f he oould cheok with

some of his contaota to determine if "Alla" ves in faot being used against

him for sono purposa, Subjeat olained that he already lion at thie point

through conversations with his Soviet colleagues tint ROXiN could cheok

without bringing it to anyone's attention.

Shortly afterwaras, ROYLIN re-

turned to Subjoot with the advibe to stop seuing her.

He cautioned Suh-

foot that he should not mention to anyone that he had talkat to him and

certainly not to say anything. Subject claims that he stopped dating her

after this point, but did oocasionally see her in the lunch room. After

Subjeot stopped seeing her she called him at his hotel every two of three

days.

At no point did MARTIN really push Subjest on continuing the relation-

ship.

11.

Subjeot desoribed their relationship as perfectly natural for two

young people Interested in each other.

They selden discussed anything of

importanoe and never disoussed his work at the Institute.

Subjeot went.

home with ber to her apartment on two separate occasions.

Once she asked

him to spend the night with her, but he indicated that he should get back

to his hotel. Subjeot desoribed her as possibly a bit more forward sexually

than others that he had met, but that their relatlonship was perfeotly

normal and certainly nothing that could be used agatnat him since he was

a single man.

The apartment was actually her nother's, a che room apert-

mant with an alcove for the bed and a small kitchen.

Subleat never met her

nother and is not sure if her father lived in the apartment with the mother.
