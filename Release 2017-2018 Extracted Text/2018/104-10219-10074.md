1. The story provided by Subjeet during our interview at the United
States Consulate in Trieste on 25 October 1465 concerning hia experiences
while in the Soviet Union is essentially the same ag that provided by Dr.
George Renninger in reference (2), Although Subject was reasonably ao-
operative, he was not as fully communtostive as we mizht have desired, In
considering the various possitle reasons for his partial hasitanee it ap-
pears rather obvious now that our continued interest in what he interpreted
to be a very simplo relationship with a Soviet girl has caused him to sus-
peot that possibly we are suspicious of his. According to Subject, the
entire episode was reported fully while {n Moscow and again to KUSARK last
Christmas while he was on a visit to the United States, Subject stated
that he had prepared a report in writing for Dr. Goldverg at Prineeton
University who acts aaa g: between for KUBARK, It 1s obvious that he was
probably eaked to prepare a general report on his experienoos while in the
Sovict Union for KULOOK which we had not been aware of previously and. whien
may not have come to the attention of KUDESK. Unless Headquartera has some
rather specifio questiona it is considered unlikely that we oan provide any
information in additicn to that reported in the following paragraphs ob-
tained during this interview,

2. Subject arrived in Mescow during the early part of Novenber 1963
on a ten month exchange fellowship arranged between the Kational Academy
of Soicnces and the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Subject was assigned to
the Lebedev Physics Institute in Moscow and the major portion of his life
while in Moscow revolved around his work at the Institute or various in-
dividuals met through the Institute, Subject ate lunch in the Institute
lunch room or cafeteria end usually at about the same time each day, some-
time between one and one thirty. Approximately two weeks after he had

arrived at the Institute, Subjest and hid EO eee Dr. George Renninger,
who “as at the Institute on a similar ten'sonth exerange fellowship, were
approached by Viadiair Anatolavich SOZOLOVSATY while waiting in the cafe~
teria line, SOKCLOVSKIY, who identified himself as an Anerican, sald that
he hed heard that they were in the Instituve and wanted to meet thea, Dur-
ing thie first conversation Subject claizs that SOFOLOVSKTY told them that
he was in fact William Hasilton MARTIN and went on to explain some of the
superfieial details surrvunaing nis aerecsion to the Soviet Union in 1905,
MARTIN told them that if they did not consider him +00 tainted, he would
welcome the opportunity of talking to ccs Averieans. He felt that there
were sany facets of his experiences while in the Soviet Union whieh be
would like to talk about but which he could not dissuse with his Soviet
friends. Either on this-oceasion or later, MARTIN nentioned that Vernon
MITCHELL, who had defested with MARTIN, wes living in Leningrad,

3. Approximately a week later Subject met MARTI again in the lunch
room, MARTIN reporte that following iis first encounter with Subject and
RENNINGER he had been called into the party office at the Institute. They
apologized to him for not having warned him in advanee that Subject and
RENNING:R were being assigned to the Institute, sinse they were certain
that Subject would have wanted to avoid ther, They told MARTIN that it
was perfectly permissible for him to talk to them, but that he should de?-
initely not reveal his true identity to them nor should he give them his
addresa in Monoow sinoe thero was the possibility that they had been sent
to the Soviet Union to a jainate him, Quite naturally they algo wanted
to know what MAHTIN had disoussed ..ith Subject and RAMNINOER. As a general
rule, Subject saw MARTIN in the lunch room every weex or two for the entire
period that he was in Moscow. On certain occasions it appeared that MARTTI
would avoid talking to Subject. Based on MANTIN's actions, Subjeot assumed
thie usually depended on who was present in the lunsh room, Subjeat addod
at this point that their discussions with MARTIN were always in English.

4, MARTIN made it definitely clear to Subject that he was intorasted
in getting out of the Soviet Union, He desoribed life in the USSR as a
constant game with the Soviet officials. MARTIN felt that he had only been
able to keep hie noad above water while there because of his knowledge of
Soviet. law. Hv explained to Subject that he had devoted a great deal of
time studying Soviet law and had used his knowledge to protect himself.
‘The Soviets were frequently at a loss when confronted with quotations from
their own laws in total confliet with actions which they were trying to
impose on MARTIN. Subject was once asked to write a letter to MARTIN's
Parents asking thes to-put pressure on the Soviets and the Press to help
in obtaining his release, Subject said that-e copy of this letter must
be available at KUBARK.

5. MARTIN eleo described in great detail to Subject life in general
within the Soviet Union and what the averase Soviet citizen must face every
day. It was obvicus to Subject that MARTIN had been greatly disillusioned
following his arrival in the USSR when he found a society totally different
from what he had anticipated prior to his departure from the United States,
The Soviets had exerted considerable pressure on Subject to participate in
various anti-US radio programs or to write anti-US articles. After mush
disoussion back and forth MARTIN agreed to write something if they would
promise to publish it without editing. He wrote what he considered a very
objective comparison of life in the USSR and that in the U.S. After having
submitted this article he was never approached again on this topic.

6, Regular contacts between Subject, RENNIN@ER and MARTIN continued
4n the luneh room with general conversations such as those noted above un-
til December or early January, 1965, At this point MARTIN asked Subject
af he or RENNINGER would. go to the U.S. Exbassy to ask them if there were
any way in whieh they could assist him in. leaving the Soviet Union legally
or otherwi: Subject roted that’ RENNINGER had already contacted the U.S.
Embassy following the first meeting with MARTIN to report on their oon-
versations with him and the fact that he was in Moscow,

7. Also at about the same tine, ‘probably early January, Subject was
standing in the lungh roun line (Subjeot always reivrred to it as the lunch
room rather than a cafeteria) when he saw MARTIN vogether with an attrec~
tive young girl about teanty or twent,-one years of age. They stopped to
chat for a wveent and MARTIN introduced Alla Aleksandrovna XOZLOVA, SubJeot
eophasized that this was entirely casual and that their conversation at this
meeting lasted ror only a few monents. A few days or possioly a week later
MARTIN saw JubJect in the lunoh room and wentioned that “Alla” had found
him quite a handsome individual, MARTIN ceatdoned this oaly in passing and
in no way, an far as Subject was concerned, atveapted to force "Alla" on sub-
Jeot. Subject was equally impressed.with "Alla" and during the following
few days made several inquiries among ils Soviet colleagues in the Insti-
tute. No one had anything particular to say about her otner than that she
was rather ative socially and had wany friends in the Inetitute., At this
point Subjeot did not know where she worxed at the Institute,

8, Sowetime during the latter part of January 1964 S-bJect had his
first date with "Alla," SubJeat could not recall exactly how this was ar-
ranged, but believes that he met her in the luneh room and asked her to go!
on a troika ride with him. This was followed by five or six other dates
with her over the next seven or eight weeks, They went to a film once, the

. Bolstvy ones, the opera once and restaurants oa two or three oocasions.

9. After a while Subject noticed that she was particularly interested
in his Soviet friends and other contacts in the Sovivt Uaion, For example,
on the evening they attended the Bolshoy, SubJeot noticed his friend William
(Bill) FARRIS, an Anerioan exchange student at the Moscow State University,
Subject had known him at Prineeton University, SubJeot said, “Oh, there is
Bill." She inmediately said, “what did you say abuut SOKOLOVSKIY?" In other
words, she knew perfeutly woll that SOKOLOVSKIY and William MARTIN were one
and the samo, She was obviously embarrased and tried without success to
cover up her blunder, MARTIN later told Subject that "Alla" had called him

thet evening to cell him of her blunder, She also onoe ashed Subject if he

1 were really going to return to the United dates, Tnis could, of course, be
interpreted ac a defection pitch. Suoject feele that it was more of a
casual personal. remarks

10. According to Subject, "Alla" seemed to him to be sush too friendly,
widle at the sane time not sincerely friendly. In February, Subjvot's. sus-
picions had mounted to the point where he decided to ask his Soviet col-
league in the Institute, Ilya ROYZIX (phonetic), if he could check with
some of his contacts to determine if “Alla” was in fact being used agtinst
him for soue purpose, Subjeot claimed that he already kiew at this point
through conversations with his Soviet colleagues that ROYZIN could shook
without bringing 1t to anyone's attention, Shortly afterwards, ROYZIN re-.
tuned to Subject with the advife to stop seeing her. fie caationed Sub-
Jeot that he should not mention to anyone that he had talked to him and
certainly not to say anything, Subject claims that he stesped dating her
after this point, but did occasionally see her in the lunch room, After
Subject stopped seeing her she called him at his hotel every two or three
days. At no point did MARTIN really push Subject on continuing the relation-
ships

11, Subject desoribed their relationship as perfectly natural for two _
young people interested in each other, They seldew discussed anything of
importance and never disoussed his work at the Institute. SubJeot went _
hone with her to her apartment on two separate casasiona, Onge she asked
him to spend the night with her, but he indicated that he: should get back
to hig hotel, Subject desoribed her as possibly a bit more forward sexually
than others that he had met, but that their relationship was perfectly
normal and certainly nothing that cculd.be used against him since he was
a single man, The apartment was ectually her mother's, a cne room apert-
ment with an alcove for the bed and a small kitchen, Subjeat never met her
mother and is not sure if her father lived in the apartment with the mother.

Subject does recall that her mother Gilt Oa, although he did

heard from someone that her father worsed for the 463, Subjest could pro-

to be pushing the relationship even though she did seem ourfoua about soce
of Subject's friends, Onoe she mentioned to Subjest that they should not.
be seen together in the lunch rom since this aight te a risk fer her.

12. Subject last saw “Alla” alone just before he ieft the Soviet Union,
He was down town one day and met her br chanow, They stopped for coffee
and chatted for awhile. ‘The only thing of any significance noved was that
she had been dismissed from the Lebedev Institute and was then working for
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, During the past suzzer, Subjeot and RENNUGER
again visited Moscow for a week (15-20 Juiy 1965). They drove from Trieste
to Prague and then on into Moscow via train, Arrangements were sade through
Inturist, They visited the Lebedev Institute for a day, a3 woll as, fens
in Mossow,. Nothing coourred on this visit of any particular note, Sub.
promised to prepare a written report on this trip during the next two or
three weeke and will pass it to the underaigned via the Consulate in Trieste,
Possibly after reviewing this report we cay have further questions, Since
his return, Subjeat has received a brief letter from “Alla” in elementary
German stating simply that she had heard that he had been in Moscow and
that she was sorry that they had not seen each other, The return address
indicated that she had moved:

Moskyia W-36
Profsojusnaja U1.15
Korpus 1 Kwartira 10

G. Kissellanscus,

(1) Travel: Zhe once visited Poland with a student group,

14, In returning to the topic of MARTIN and Subjeot's contact with him,
Subject reported that MARTIN usually cfd most of the talking, He discussed
life in the Soviet Union end frequently his attempts to get a divorce, (when
Subject was in Mosoow in July he learned that MARTIN had finally received his
divoree), MARTIN onee told Subjeot that he was permitted to receive Tize and
Life xagazines so Jong as he agreed not to show tem to anyone. Subject and
REXNINGER once referred to tne allegations that MARTIN and MITCHELL were homo-
sexuals, MARTIN stated emphatically that thin wes not true, He said tht
he bad nome sox problems, bot that he was certainly not a homosexual. With
regard to his defcotion, FAKTIN said that he had contacted someone pricr to
his defeotion, Subjeot unserstood that no money was involved and that ARTIN
had not been an inplace agent.

15. With regard to Headquarters desire for a personal asseasment of
Subject, the ciroumstances surrounding this meeting with Subject did not
provide an opportunity for eny sort of valid assesszent. Ile was constant~
ly on the edge of his chair for the reasons previously noted above, As a
bright and unusually gifted young theoretical physicist he spends much of
his tine wrapped up in a world of his om, At the same tine he does enjoy
exin diving, skiing and other cports. In some ways he seeng to be rather
naive, Possibly this is the wrong terminology, A better way of dexorib-
ing hiei would be to say that he is so imrolved in his own field of special-
izationthat he simply has never taken tize to properly consider many of the
other problems we fase in lifo, In going ovor we list of questions above

: be mentioned very proudly that he was an atheist, At this point all of
these remarks are: probably meaningless and should not be given any. weight
in agseseing Subject for possible future operational use. The undersigned
expects that he will again be in Trieste in the not too distant future and
will wake @ point of having lusoh or dinner with him, Possibly under more
relaxed ciroumstances we can obtain a more objective picture of him as an
individual,

16, If Headquarters has any specific follow-up questions we will
try to cover thes when we see Subject again, We are at the point now,
however, where any further questions should be rather specific to be
eeaningful, Though much of the above is simply a review of information
previously reported, we hope that a few of the new details will be of
some value to ODENVY and Headquarters.
