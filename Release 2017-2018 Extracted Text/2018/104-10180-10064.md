MEMORANDUM FOR THR AECORD
SUBJECT; IDEN A

. 1. IDEN A telephoned IDEN B on 15 June 1966
who asked him to come to Hadrid as soon ae possible
go that be could be back in San Juan before the 25th
of June. The, implication wes that IDEN A should be
back in San Juan in time to talk to @ PERUMEN who
was with the PBRUHEN delegation to the Tenth Central
American and Caribbean Games. (ICEN C, was @
delegate to the Games).

2. IDEN A and IDEN PB developed a plan that
involved two action agents already inside PBRUMEX.
One was to assassinate AKTIUG either by rifle fire
or reuote controlled radio activated explosives
while the other agent was to establish a nilitary base
in the ‘central part of PBRUMEN Station Medrid] j(o- 2
spoke with IDEN A who reported he believed ANTHUG
would topple within the next few months and that. -
te already had @ group inside PERUMEN.

3. IDEN A was interviewed upon bis return
to San Juan where he reported that he did not have
any fira evidence that ANTUG would topple within
the next few months but only that he intuitively believed
that AMTHUG'’s downfall was inainent. Se based this
oD reports that things were getting worse in PERUMEN
and that the people were ready to revolt. fe also
based it on the fact that he now bas two action agents
‘of the same caliber as AKLASH inside PBRUMEN who are
ready to do tis bidding.

4. TDOEN A's ents’ inside PRRUMEN are probably
IDEN C, who might cooperate with ID°X B but not necessarily



eta eee vv nareeaenst circuses ans nents panne nt

with IDEN A. Further theré is no firm evidence thaS
IDEX ¢ is against the present regime in PBRUMEN. IDEN D
is another possible contact. Again, other than sone
unsupported allegations there is no independent

firm evidence that IDEN D is anti-regine.

$. IDEN A also claimed in Madrid that
IDEN & had dent bim-a@ message and that be vas considered
@ potential ally. He explained this in San Juan
by sayfog that during a prese conference his nawe
had been mentioned and that IDEN E replied that he
considered 2BEN A to be his friend. IDEN A rationalized
“that 1 IDEN E had not wanted to indicate in some way
that he was ‘with’ ID™N A he would have taken this
opportunity to blast bin.

6. I debriefed IDEN A on bie Madrid trip and
intentions generally betore I istroduced him to
AMEADGER/1. I had first asked xin if he would mind
reporting to us via a trusted PERUMEN exile now living
in San Juan and, atter I bad icentified AMBADGER/1, he
replied that he knew him and respected ard liked him,
The three of. us had a meeting ard it waa agreed that
IDEN A would keep AMBADGER/1 ccapletely informed of
his plans and that AKRADGER/i sould convey then to
me in PRPRIME, IDEN A refused to reveal the .
identities of his agents inside PERUHEN deapite strong
pressure. He also stated that IDFN F and IDEN G would
have to know about his arrangement with AMDADGER/1
and with KUBARK. IDEN F ard IDEN G, together with
IOEN A, are the triumvirate of the JURE.
