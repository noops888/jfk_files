1. On the afternoon of 12 February, called the Anthony Abraham
Chevrotet Agency (on Si 8th St and LeJuene Avenue, Miami, 7
tel: 414-3561) and asked the operator to speak with Subject.

Ky call was transferred to a secretary who said he was
“around, but stepped out a minute." She asked if he could i
‘return my call, but I said I would call back later.

2. Minutes after, I called Alberto BEGUIRISTAIN, a salesman A

with Anthony Abraham. (Since c. July 2974, I have been in 3.27
loose contact with Alberto,: -Hqs and :

inquiryirg about his mother (she is still inside hoping for i

an exit permit) and offering to send him my new PO Box, IT fe
discreetly inquired if Subject still worked there. AFFIRMATIVE

was his answer. In fact, he wanted to qet him to the phone,

thinking I wanted to talk ts hin. I thanked him but said ~~
I would probably come by another day to see him. I asked him tt
not to comment my call with Subject and he agreed. H

3, Subject has -for the past 4 of 5 years= been publically known ene
Sebjertw car salesman’for the Abraham Agency. His ads in the Hitthicg
5 loeal Cuban tabloids have been frequent. He also contributes
eal} to the same tabloids and the "Diario de las Americas” newspaper
with political articles and patriotic and philosophical poems
(as the une attached from tonight's “Diario.") Although he es
apparently takes himself seriously as an autnor/poet
fntellectual, his calents as a car salcsman have kept him
from going hungry. In fact, it is sald he has been a most
_guécessful salesman, winning many sales awards.
