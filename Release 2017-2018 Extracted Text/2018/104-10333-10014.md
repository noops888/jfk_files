Re: Proposal for a Multi-Agency Declassification Review of Joseph Califano's Army

Papers under the JFK Act

Gentlemen:

The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you t

declassify six boxes of Army records from the files of Joseph Califano. The files date

incipally from the period 1962-63, during which Mr. Califano served as Army Gener

ounsel and as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Army. The records had be

leposited at the National Archives and Records Administration, where they wer

ecently located. A description of the records, which primarily pertain to U.S. activitie

Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the United States Information

Agency, and others.

Deadlines

Due to the volume of the records, and the Review Board's current sunset date of

September 30, 1997, it is important that we proceed expeditiously in our review of the

records.' We have slated the Califano papers for review by the Board at its August 5-6, 1997

meeting. The Review Board staff is prepared to assist you in making arrangements for a

prompt and efficient review of the Califano papers.

Preliminary Review of Califano Papers

The Review Board staff has conducted an initial review of the records and has

tentatively reached the following conclusions: first, the records are very similar in

subject manner to many other records that already are a part of the JFK Collection;

second, although the vast majority of the records technically remain classified, there is

little remaining sensitivity due to the passage of time and to the release of much of the

information in other contexts; and third, the Califano papers contain equities of

numerous military and non-military agencies, which, under the standard referral

process, would be very difficult and time-consuming? Thus, the logistical problem in

declassifying the records is not the continued sensitivity of the records, but the number

of agencies that will need to review their own equities in the records. For this reason,

and for the short time-line on which we are now operating, we believe that there is an

urgent need to make acceptable arrangements for the review and referral of necords.

Proposal

In order to expedite the process and make it more efficient, we would like to propose an

each other and quickly to resolve questions.

Vis. Toni Bowie, of the Army Declassification Activity, spent three days

eviewing some of the records and making recommendations for referrals to othe

agencies both within and outside of the military. Although Ms. Bowie worked

energetically for three days, it was our sense afterwards that, if we continue at the same

pace, the agencies with equities will likely not be able to complete their reviews before

the August deadline arrives.

Department of Defense are agreeable to such an arrangement, the Review Board will

take the responsibility for contacting all non-military agencies with equities in the

records while Army and DoD make arrangements for all appropriate military entities to

be present

We are, of course, very willing to consider other ideas or suggestions that you might

have. However, because the clock is ticking, it is important that we promptly develop a

plan that will provide all agencies with equities in the Califano papers to have an

opportunity to review and declassify their equities.

Ilook forward to discussing this issue with you.

JOSEPH CALIFANO PAPERS (6 boxes)

Identified by Steve Tilley at NARA, these 6 boxes of papers, almost exclusively fron

1962-63, were either generated by, or addressed to Joseph Califano, who at this time

was Department of the Army General Counsel and Special Assistant to the Secretary of

the Army. Most of the documents are short summaries of proposed policy positions, or

letters of transmittal, with voluminous appendices attached. Each of the 6 boxes

contains approximately 1500-2000 pages of material.

Representative Topics:

(1)

ICCCA (Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs the

"Cottrell Committee") meetings on future U.S. policy toward Cuba. These

• documents are generally background papers prepared prior to meetings,

minutes of meetings, or follow-on discussion of action iters assigned at

meetings of the ICCCA.

(2)

Contingency plans for Cuban invasion by the U.S. military in the event of

a Cuban uprising.

(3)

(4)

Psychological warfare against Cuba.

Diplomatic initiatives intended to increase isolation of Cuba.

(5)

Biographies, and evaluations of Cuban exile leaders.

(6)

Intelligence reports and estimates on reported events inside Cuba.

(7)

Summaries of clandestine paramilitary actions taken against Cuba, and

suggestions for possible future actions.

Apparent Equities:

Ninety-five per cent of the documents appear to have multiple agency equities,

usually 4 to 6 agencies per document. Based upon $taff review, it is estimated

that 80% of the documents have State equities, 60% Joint Staff or OSD, 60% NSC,

60% CIA, 15% Army, Navy or Air Force, perhaps 10% DIA, and a small

percentage of USIA, Justice, Treasury and FBI.

JOINT STAFF PAPERS (147 documents)

Using broad topic guidelines provided previously by ARRB staff, the Joint Staff at the

Pentagon has reviewed 40 boxes of records of Joint Chiefs Chairmen Lyman Lemnitzer,

Maxwell Taylor, and Earle Wheeler for 1961-1964, as well as JCS central files for 1962

and 1963, and has flagged 147 documents which will enhance the historical

understanding of the Kennedy administration, and which some scholars will believe

may be relevant to the assassination.

Topics:

(1) ICCCA (Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs)

meetings regarding future U.S. policy toward Cuba.

(2)

Special Group (5412 committee) meetings and decisions; and covert

paramilitary operations against Cuba.

(3) . Cuban coup planning.

(1)

(5)

Vietnam coup planning, and discussion of Diem and Nhu.

OPLAN 34A (covert actions against North Vietnam).

6)

U.S. military strength levels in Vietnam.

Apparent Equities:

Multiple agency equities appear to apply to virtually every document-usually

State, OSD and /or NSC. The Joint Staff has stated in writing that it is prepare

to expeditiously process these documents for declassification in collaboratior

with agencies which have equities, and then accession the declassified

documents to NARA. Currently the Joint Staff is awaiting guidance from ARKB

staff on which of the tabbed folders we desire to have placed in the collection;

upon receipt of that guidarce, they will commence declassification review.

under the JEK. Act

Gentlemen:

The Assassination Records Review Board would like to make arrangements with you to

declassify approximately 147 records previously flagged by the Joint Staff from both the

¡CS Central Files, and the papers of JCS Chairmen Lemnitzer, Taylor and Wheeler. The

files date principally from the period 1961-64. The recorde were flagged during

searches directed by Mr. Edmund McBride (Chief, Information Management Division,

Joint Staff) at the request of the ARRB staff. With one exception, ARRB staff feels that

all records flagged by Mr. McBride's working group are relevant to the historical

understanding or context of the assassination of President Kennedy. A description of

the records, which primarily pertain to U.S. activities related to Cuba, or to Vietnam

policy, is attached hereto. We have identified what appear to us to be equities of

numerous military entities in these papers, as well as equities of the Central Intelligence

Agency, the State Department, the National Security Council, and others.

Proposal

In order to expedite the process and make it more efficient, we would like to propose an

alternate arrangement for declassification of records that we previously have found

effective. We suggest the holding of a multi-agency concurrent review of these paper

of the three aforementioned JCS Chairmen and the JCS Central Files. We would like tr

schedule a single session at our offices, on or before July 23, 1997, where all agencies

with equities in these JCS/Joint Staff papers be concurrently present for a

declassification review. At such a session, agencies would be able to review their own

be able to revisit the schedule proposed below.

"The Joint Staff's Initial Statement of Compliance to the Review Board, dated

February 6, 1997, identified in detail the process by which these records were located-

namely, which files were searched, and who participated in the searches. Mr. Edmund

McBride, Chief of the Joint Staff Information Management Division, indicated in this

statement that the Joint Staff was standing by to expeditiously process these records fo

leclassification in collaboration with other agencies when the ARRB was ready. ARRI

staff has only recently completed its initial review of these records, which constitute

selectively flagged folders within 40 boxes of JCS and Joint Staff records.

equities in the records, declassify them, and simply hand them across the table to other

agencies for their review. It has been our own experience that sessions of this sort

greatly simply the review process by giving agencies the opportunity to speak with

each other and quickly to resolve questions.

Because these papers will need to be reviewed by the Board at its August 5-6 meeting

we believe that an arrangement such as is proposed above will provide all agencies

with a full opportunity to identify their equities in the records and to make

determinations regarding the need for continued classification. If the Joint Staff and the

Department of Defense are agreeable to such an arrangement, the Review Board will

take the responsibility for contacting all non-military agencies with equities in the

records while the Joint Staff and DoD make arrangements for all appropriate military.

Concept: This to be accomplished by the clandestine introduction of

a "special" vacuum tube into selected communications equipment. The tube,

which is available, is virtually undetectable inasmuch as its effectiveness is

due to the insertion of a chemical compound in the base of the tube. The

chemical, when heated becomes a conductor, when cool a non-conductor.

the Cuban people.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by airdropping valid Pan American

or KLM one-way airline tickets good for passage to Mexico City, Caracas,

etc. (none to the U.S.). Tickets could be intermixed with other leaflets

planned to be dropped.

The number of tickets dropped could be increased.

The validity of the tickets would have to be restricted to a time period.

3. Operation TURN ABOUT:

his value to the revplutionary cause has diminished to the point where plans are

being made for his "removal".

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by the use of intelligence means the

Operation DEFECTOR:

Objective: To induce elements or individuals of the Cuban military to

defect with equipment.

b. Concept: This activity when properly planned and implemented has the

effect of decreasing military capability. In a totalitarian system the immediate

reaction is increased security accompanied by decreased activity. It also

creates havoc in security and intelligence agencies. Could be accomplished

by intelligence means and promise of rewards.

5. Operation BREAK-UP:

Objective: To clandestinely introduce corrosive materials to cause

aircraft, vehicle or boat accidents.

b. Concept: This activity, if possible should be aimed primarily toward the 3cr:

Soviet provided aircraft. Il properly accomplished it would degrade confidence

in the equipment, increase supply and maintenance problems and seriously

affect combat capability.

6. Operation COVER-UP:

Objective: The objective in to convince the Communist government of

Cuba that Naval Forces ostensibly assigned to the MERCURY project is merely

b. Concept: It should not be revealed as to what the cover is--this should

be left to conjecture. This could tie in with Operation DIRTY TRICK.

7. Operation DIRTY TRICK:

a. Objective: The objective is to provide irrevocable proof that, should

the MERCURY manned orbit flight fail, the fault lies with the Communists

et al Cuba.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by manufacturing various pieces of

evidence which would prove electronic interference on the part of the. Cubans.

8: Operation FULL-UP:

Objective: The objective is to destroy confidence in fuel supplied by the

Soviet Bloc by indicating it is contaminated.

"Concept: This to be accomplished by introducing a known biological

agent into jet fuel storage facilities. This agent flourishes in jet fuel and

grows until it consumes all the space inside the tank.

9. Operation PHANTOM:

Objective: The objective is to convince the Castro Government that

clandestine penetration and resupply of agents is being regularly conducted.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by use of BJ, UDT, AND JJ capa-

bilities to create the impression that landings have been made on beaches

and air dropa have been made in other areas.

10. Operation BINGO:

a. Objective: The objective in to create an incident which has the appearançe...:

of an attack on U.S. facilities (GMO) in Cuba, thus providing the excuse for

use of U.S. military might to overthrow the current government of Cuba.

b. Concept: This to be accomplished by the use of SNAKES outside the

confines of the Guantanamo Base. SNAKES simulate 'an actual fire-fight and

upon hearing such a sound it is entirely feasible that the immediate reaction

on G'Mo would be that the base is being attacked.

This would, with proper

preparation, be followed by a counterattack and with adequate planning the base

at G'Mo could disgorge military force in sufficient number to sustain itself

until other forces, which had been previoualy alerted, could attack in other

areas. It is envisaged that a schedule of operations similar to the following

would overwhelm the Cuban military and cause its defeat:

(1) Simulated attack on Guantanamo.

(2) Word flashed to the President..

(3) President orders counterattack to include:

(a) Immediate launch of alerted aircraft whose targets are Cuban airfields.

(b) Immediate launch of counterattack down strategic lines in communi-

cation in Cuba.

(c) Fleet force standing by on alert would make way toward pre-selected

targets/landing areas

(d) Immediate embarkation of airborne troops previously alerted to

pre-selected targets.

(o) Launch of additional combat aircraft to clear drop areas and

further interdict lines of communication.

(1) Ships and aircraft would land/airdrop troops and secure airfields,

(g) Resupply and replacement activities.

Properly executed, the above could overthrow the Cuban Government in a

matter of hours, providing the plan is implemented within the next six months.

11. Operation GOOD TIMES:

Objective: To disillusion the Cuban population with Castro image by

distribution of fake photographic material.

b. Concept: Prepare a desired photograph, such as an obese Castro

with two beauties in any situation desired, ostensibly within a room in the -

Castro residence, lavishly furnished, and a table briming over with the most

delectable Cuban food with an underlying caption (appropriately Cuban) such as

I'My ration is different. " Make as many prints as desired on sterile paper and

then distribute over the countryside by air drops or agents. This should put

even a Commie Dictator in the proper perspective with the underprivileged

12. Operation HEAT IS ON:

• a. Objective: To create the impression with Castro Government that

certain dyed-in-the-wool Red pilots are planning to defect, thus causing a

detrimental tightening of security.

b. Concept:. It is known that many Cuban refugee pilots are personally

acquainted with many of the present CRAF pilots. Accordingly, by utilizing

all sources available, determine by name those pilote considered to be dedicated

Castro Reds. Then by use of agents, communications, etc. inject into the

Castro intelligence system the fact that these pre-designated Reds are planning

to defect for monetary and/or ideological reasons. Security crackdown should

help destroy Castro image and also impose unacceptable restrictions on

routine training activities.

CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS:

The Air Force can utilise the operational characteristica of F-101

or other Century series aircraft to create the impression that anti-Castro

opposition in continuing. The aircraft operational characteristic to be

exploited is the "sonic-boom."

3o The "sonic-boom" can be employed in several different ways such

as an individual boom at selected spots or a continuous boom and performed

at either high or low altitudes. It will cause not only apprehension but

varying degrees of malicious damage as well, i,e. break all the windows

on a street in Havana.

4. The "sonic-hoom" effect can be maximized by planning missions

for execution during the early morning hours when the populace is sleeping.

'he Cuban people are generally unfamiliar with this phenomenon, therefor

t is felt that the impact for a time would be most beneficia

5. The directional aspects of the "sonic-boom" also make it feasible

Operation TRUE BLUE

1. Objective: To degrade Castro and his government in the eyes of the

Cuban peoplf by communicationa intrusion.

Concept of Operations:

2. By utilizing high powered transmitters in the vicinity of Cuba

(Florida, Inagwa, Jamaica,

aboard Naval ship) which have the capability of

overriding commercial Cuban radio and TV stations, periodically degrade

Castro and other government figures in the minds of the Cuban people.

3. The technique of communications intrusion could be exploited by pre-

taping or live broadcasts of anti-communist and anti-Castro propaganda at

station breaks, Castro speeches, etc. This idea envisions the use of a

Cuban refugee to make such broadcasts and naturally would require close

monitoring of stations to be worked. Any number of thoughte could be

injected such as:

a.

"Cuba Si, Russia No."

Communism exploits the masses.

c. Communism is ruthless totalitarianiem.

d. Castro and henchment feast off the land while we are rationed.

e. Castro and his reign of terror.

Castro is a lunatic and should be put away.

Castro is the cause of all our troubles.

h. Rise up against the pig Castro, etc. etc.

4. Il approved this operation could become a continuous project, perhaps

under control of USLA.

1. Objective: To confuse and barrass Castro Cuban Pilots by use of

2. Concept of Operations: Fly Cuban refugee pilot in sterile aircraft

in prosimity of Cuba at periodic intervale while communication monitoring

Cuban air/ground frequencies utilized for airdrome control. Cuban refugee

pilot in sterile aircraft would personally know many of the pilots still flying

for Castro. Refugee pilot would get into argument with Castro pilots over

radio thus distracting confusing, etc. Would be real trouble for Castro

pilots in actual weather conditions. Argument could go, "I'Il get you you.

UNG AND

I. Operation SMASHER.

1. Objective: Disrupt or disable military and commercial communications

facilities in Cuba.

2. Technical Reguirements:

a. Detailed information on both commercial and military communi-

cations facilities and capabilities, to include inside and outside plant

construction, system networks, equipment detaile fi. e. circuitry, tubes, etc.)

location and type of repeator stations. This information is required to

construct a refined device.

b. A vacuum tube modified in such a manner as to cause a short

circuit.

This is possible by inducing silicon carbide (?) into the base of the

tube.

When the tube becomes hot the silicon carbide liquifies and becomes

a conductor; when the tube cools the matter returns to a solid non-conductive

state. Such a device (vacuur tube) is available.

3. Targets:

a. Cuban Telephone Company. The company provides local and long

distance telephone service throughout Cuba and also international telephone

service.

b. Radio Corporation of Cuba Avenida Carlos. The company provides

radiotelephone service to American and European countries. It also provides

radiotelograph service and includes leased teleprinter channele. In conjunc-

tion with AT&T the company inaugurated over-the-horizon microwave radio

service between Cuba and Florida in 1957. This latter made available two-way

TV channels.

c. Cuban American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Founded by

IT&T and AT&T, providing six (6) submarine cables linking Havana and Key

West. Facility operates in conjunction with microwave link.

d. Commercial Radio and Television Stations.

• Military Radio and Land-line Facilities. These include point-to

point command and administrative systems, air/ground facilities, navigationa

aids. Obviously certain commercial facilities provide service to the military

therefore disrupting or disabling commercial facilities will affect military

communications capabilities.

• 1. As requested in referenced memorandun, the position of

the Department of Defense, with respect to the military stake

and wale in the removal of the Comunist regime in Cuba, has

beer durainined based upon the following factors:

serlous threat to 1ts securlty. This Increases our national

vulnerability and defense costs as forces are developed.

or shifted to meet this threat.

D. 'It provides the Soviet Union with the most effective

base they have ever had for spreading Communism throughout

the Western Hemisphere. This in turn greatly Increases the

possibility that additional Latin American countries will

come under Commentat control. Elimination of this base would

demonstrate to the other nations of the world that the United

training areas, facilities and rights, as well as sources

of strategic materials necessary to our military

capabillty.

(4) An Increased threat to US usage and control

of the Panama Canal through subversion and sabotage..

3. The urgenoy of

the requirement to remove the Communist

goverament from Cuba is made apparent by Castro's constantly

Increaaing capabilitles. for attacking other nations of the

Western Hemisphere and for spreading Cormunism throughout the

henisphere.

This sense of urgency is greatly Increased 1f

courses of action within the capability of the Communists

are considered:

a. The Soviete could establish land, sea and/or air

bases in Cuba.

•D. The Sovieta could provide Castro with a number of

ballistic misailes with nuolear warheads; or they could

furnish the missiles and maintain Joint control of the

nuolear warheads.

4. In view of the factors set forth above, the Department of

Defense holda that the Communiat regime in Cuba is Incompatible

with the minimm security requirements of the Western

Hemisphere. The Department of Defense i8 prepared to overtly

support any popular movement inside Cuba to the extent of

ousting the Communist regime and Installing a government

acceptable to the United States. While the possibility of

Conmunist Bloc rcactions in areas other than In Cuba 18

precipitating general war, and without serious effect on

as yet no bilateral mutual support agreement binding the USER

to the delense of Cuba, Cuba has not yet become a member of the

Warraw Pact, nor have the Soviets established Soviet bases

since time appears to be an important factor in resolution of

the Cuba problem, all projects are suggested within the time

frame of the next few montha.

CONCLUSION

..?. The suggested courses of action appended to Enclosure A

satisfactorily respond to the statement of the problem. However,

these suggestions-should be forwarded as a preliminary submission

sultable for planning purposes, and together with similar inputs

[rom other agencios, provide a basis for development of a single,

integrated, time-phased plan to focus all efforts on the

objective of Justification for Ve military Intervention in Cuba.

PRETEXTS TO JUSTIFY US MILITARY INIERVENTION IN CUBA

(Note: The courses of aotion which follow are a preliminary

submission suitable only for planning purposes. They are

arranged neither chronologically nor in aecending order.

Together with similar inputs from other agencies, they are

Intended to provide a point of departure for the development

of a siriglo, Integrated, time-phased plan. Juch a plan would

permit the evaluation of individual projeots within the context

of cumlative, correlated sotions designed to lead Inexorably

to the objeotive of adequate Justifloation for US military

. Intervention in Cuba).

1. Since it would seen destrable to use legitimate

provocation: as the basis for US military Intervention In Cuba

a cover and deception plan, to Include requialte preliminary

sotions guch as has been developed in response to Task 33 c,

sould be executed as an Initial effort to provoke Cuban

reactions. Harassment plus deceptive actions to convince the

Cubans of Imminent invasion would be emphasized. Our military

posture throughout execution of the plan will allow a rapid..

ohange fron ixerotse to intervention if Cuban response justifies.

2.' A series of well coordinated inoidents will be planned

to take place in and around Guantanamo to give gemulne

appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.

a. Inaldents to establish & credible attaok (not In

obronological order):

(1) Start rumors (many). Use olandestine radio.

(2), Land friendly Cubans in uniforn "over-the-fence"

• to stage attack on base.

(3) Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the

base.

(4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly

Cubans).

(5) Blow up ammunition inside the base, start fires.

(6) Burn afroraft on als base (sabotage).

(7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base.

Some damage to inatallations.

• (8) Capture sasault teams approaching from the sea

or viainity of Quantanamo City.

(9) Capture militia group which storma the base.

(10) Sabotage ship in harbor; large fires - napthalene.

(11) 81nk ship near barbor entrance. Conduct funerals

b. United States would respond by executing offensive

operations to secure water and pover supplies, destroying

artillery and mortar emplacements which threaten the base.

o. Commence large soale United States military operations.

3. A "Remember the Maine" Inoident could be arranged in

several forms:

a. We could blow. up a US ahip in Guantanamo Bay and

blame Cube.

b. We could blow up & drone (urmanned) vessel anywhere

10 the Cuban waters. We could arrange to onuse such inaldent.

In the vioinity of Havana or Santiago as a speotaoular result

of Cuban attack from the air or sea, or both. The presence

of Cuban planes or ahips merely Investigating the Intent of

the vessel could be falrly compelling evidence that the ship

was talen under attack. The nearness to Havana or santiago

would add oredibility espeolally to those people that might

have heard the blast or have seen the fire. The Us could

follow up with an air/sea resoue operation covered by US

Iighters to "evaouate" remaining members of the non-existent

wave of national indignation.

4. We could develop a Commiut Cuban terror campaign In

extent of wounding in Instances to be widely publloized.

Exploding a few plastio bombs in carefully chosen apota, the

arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents

projecting the idea of an irresponsible goverment.

additional ones contrived for exposure. For example, advantage

can be taken of the sensitivity of the Dominioan A1r Force to

Intrusions within their national air space.

"Cuban" B-26 or

0-46 type atroraft oould make cane-burning raids at. night.

Soviet Bl00 Inoandlartes could be found. This sould be coupled

with "Cuban" messages to the Communist underground in the

Dominican Republio and "Cuben" shipments of arms which would

be found, or intercepted, on the beach. i

6. Use of MId type airoralt by US pilots could provide

additional provocation, Harasiment of o1v1l alr, attacks on

surface shipping and destruation of Us nilitary drone atroraft

by MID type planes would be useful as complementary aotions..

An P-86 properly painted would vonvince air passengers that they

saw a Cuban MIG, especlally 1f the pilot of the transport were

to announde such faot. The primary drawbaok to this suggestion

appears to be the security risk inherent in obtaining or modify

Ing an aircraft. However, reasonable copies of the MId could

be produced from US resources in about three monthe.

9. It 1s possible to create an inoident which will make it

appear that Communiet Cuban MIQs have destroyed a USAF airoraft

over international watera in an unprovoked attaok.

a. Approximately 4 or 5 F-101 aircraft will be dispatched

In tra11 from Homestead ArB, Florids, to the veinity of Cuba.

Their miesion wiil be to reverse course and simulate fakir

aircraft for an air defense exeroise in southern Florida.

These atroraft would conduot varlations of these flights at

frequent Intervals. Crews would be briefed to remain at

least 12 miles off the Cuban coast; however, they would be

reguired to oarry live aumnition In the event that hostile

actions were taken by the Cuban NIce.

D. on one such flight, a pre-briefed pilot would fly

tall-end Charley at conalderable interval between atroraft.

While near tha Cuban Island this pilot rould broadoast that

he had bean jumped by MIds and was going down. No other

oalls would be made: The pllot would then fly directly

weat at extremoly low altitude and land at a secure base, an

Igiln aulllary. The piroraft would be met by the proper

people, quickly stored and given a ser tall number. The

pilot to had performed the mission under an ailas, would

resume his proper identity ant return to his normal place

of businese. The pllot and airoraft would then have

disappeared,

o. At preoisely the same time that the aircraft was

presumably shot down a submarine or small surface craft

DISCUSSION

INTRODUCTION

1. Purpose, This report is in response to a request from

the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, to consider the desira-

bility and requirements of a fomented revolt in Cube.

Includes an examination of engineering an incident or

a series

of incidents as a ceuse for imasion and consideration of

pertinent comments received from CINCLANT.

2. Summary. Study of the desirability and the requirements

of a fomented revolt in Cuba and of the advantages of

engineering an incident or a series of incidents rather than

trying to generate and coordinate action from inside involving

many Cubans of doubtful reliability leads to the conclusions

that:

a. It Is unlikely that an effective spontaneous revolt

will occur in the near future.

D. Any uprising without US overt support is likely to

be short-lived because of the Improved Cuban/Soviet •

milItary capabilities presently In Cuba and Castro's

Increasingly efficient internal security

operations.

c. There appears to be little likelihood that the Castro

communist regime will risk a direct provocation that

could be used as a pretext for US intervertion.

d. Unless the United States intervenes militarily, the

Castro government will become more firmly entrenched and 1ts

efforte and ability to spread international communism v111

Increase.

e. The United States should intervene militarily in

Cuba and could (a) engineer provocative incidenta ostensibly

perpetrated by the Castro regime to serve as the cause of

Invasion or (b) foment a revolt within Cuba which would

call for US military intervention.

f. Engineered provocation would provide greater advantages

In control, timing, simplicity, and security than would a

fomented revolt. It would be most difficult to generate a

widespread effective revolt. However, the staging of a local

uprising as a contrived incident should not be precluded.

8. The United States should:

(1) Initiate a coordinated program to create a pre-

text for US military Intervention In Cuba.

(2) In support of the above, undertake a flezibly

phased effort to bulld Cuban resistance potential, con-

mending with the; intensification of intelligence collec

tion and sabotage in Cuba, and the creation of a frame-

work for guerrilla activity.

(3) At a propitious time, launch appropriate military

aotion to remove the Castro communigt government.

h. Implementation of the above would involve many

agencies of the United States Government.

It would appear

necessary that one governmental organization should-be

siven the primary responsibility for developing such a

national plan. The Joint Chiefs of Staff should participate

in the development of this national plan.

1. The broad concepts herein and the views of the Joint

Chiefs of Staff abould be forwarded to the Special Group

(5412 Committee) for consideration under the provisions of

NSAM 57.

J. CINCIANT'a concept for fomenting a revolt in Cuba

while containing much merit, should be re-examined both

for 1ts timing and for the large-scale guerrilla activity

1t envisages.

b. Conduct physical and psychological military harassment

of the Cuban regime and covert and clandestine operations as

directed.

C. Undertake military action in Cuba in aocordance with

contingenoy plans approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and

directed by the President. The primary purpose of the us

military intervention would be to assure

the overthrow of

the castro communist government and to assist in the establish.:

ment of a new, non-communist goverment acceptable to the

United States.

20. The Implementation of any of the suggested courses of

action in this study would involve many agencies of the United

States Government. It would appear necessary, therefore, that

one single governmental organization be given the primary

responsibility for developing a national plan.

21.. Beause of the extensive military operations involved,

the Joint Chiefs of Staff should participate in the develoyment

of this national plan.

In addition, for a contrived revolt,

they should be assigned the specific responsibility for develop-

ing the military and paramilitary aspects of the plan. This

would require the Joint Chiefs of Staff to seek a determination

under NSAM 57 when a revolt contrived by the United States were

an operation large enough to warrant control of covert forces

by the Department of Defense and that CINCLANT be designated as

the DOD agent. In this connection, CINCLANT haa developed a

specific concept for politioal and military action in Cuba.

CINCLANT CONCEPT

22. The CINCIANT concept provides for inciting a revolt in

Cuba, followed by overt, large-scale US military operations.

The proposed timing of operations permite completion in 15-18

months. Supporting operations by CIA, state, and USIA W1l1

be required.

23. Preliminary operations require the introduction by CIA

as soon as practicable of assets into Cuba for the development

of Intelligence, the organiastion by State of a Free Cuban

Government (ICQ), the development of a propaganda plan by USIA, and

the development of a suitable cover plan.

24. Actual operations would commence with the execution by

CINCIANT of OPIAN 380-63 about 15 Jamary 1964, This plan calls

for Infiltrating of Jw forces into Cuba for area assessment,

establishing guerrilla bases, developing military units,

establishing escape and evasion nets and conducting subversion.

On about 15 June 1964, OW forces would be augmented and would

accelerate subversive operations to create conditions favorable

for establishing a Free Cuban Government on Cuban soil and for

employnent of conventional forces.

25. CINCLANT then proposed that on about 15 July mobilization

of forces for US conventional operations would begin. Execution of

•CINCLANT. OPLAN 312 would commence on 26 July 1964 followed by

D-Lay OPIAN 316; about 3 Auguot 19€4.-

26. Although the foregoiny schedule is approximate, it should

be noted that the Free Cuban Government would be required to

exist at least for 18 days In the face of the Castro government's

excellent counterguerrilla abllity. This time requirement appears

to be excessive, but it could be shortened. The criteria for

United States recognition of a now government could be met in

this period. The Free Cuban Governnent could clalm 1t:

a 'Was in actual possession of the governmental machinery.

b. Was administering It with general acceptance by the

population; and,

C. Was prepared to honor International obligations:

aotivation of a separate headquarters. In thia case, CINCIANT

would re-evaluate his staff capabilities and submit appropriate

recommendations to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

30. CINCIANT in a related outline concept recommended, con-

cerning the use of Cuban nationale in UW operations, that "AB

practical, the Military Services should Initially form their

Cuban nationals into Integral, all Cuban units . . .". It 18

connidered that the oreation of a "Cuban Expeditionary Forde" In

antioipation of its employment in the execution of OPLAN 316 18

a r18k thich cannot be Justifled and should not be undertakon.

There appears to be no reason, however, why Cubans could not be

formed Into mall teame for use In UN activities. It in estimated

that from two to four hundred carefully selected Cubans could be

used in this role. It would be appropriate for the CIA in a

supporting role to seleot and train the individuals forming them

Into teams of appropriate size to be made available for joint use

by CINCLANT or by CIA, as necessary.

31. For other details of training Cuban nationals, see

JCSM-350-63.

32. The force levela in CINCLANT OPIANS 312 and 316 are adequate

to cope with the Improved Cuban military capability and the

presence of Soviet troopa on the island.

33. The experience of the JUWIFA during the Cuban crisia in

October 1962, indicates that the present military supply system

in the CONUS w111 be unable immediately. to provide equipment and

supples in the required configuration for projected OW operations

34. The conceptual outline submitted by CINCLANT does not.

provide an exact plan in detail for contriving a revolt in

Cuba. However, his general concept would provide for:

"a. Incremental steps in replacing the present communist

dominated government of Cuba by infiltration, subversion,

unconventional warfare, linited conventional actions and

finally full-scale Invasior in that order, if necessary.

D. The capabillty of UB to withdraw at any point. in the

process 1f unfavorable international reactions or pressures

require It; or 1f the Cuban people themselves, in a successful

revolt, overthrow the present regime and form a government

favorable to U8 interests.

c. An ambiguous atmosphere during the critical phases

a direct. confrontation of pover until events would preclude

timely action on their part to prevent our intended result

in Cuba.

d. Utilization of the OAS Forum and support without being

dependent upon 0AS approval or disapproval for the necessary

Intermediate steps leading up to OA8 recognition of a Cuban

Government In exile and the final, decisive military action.

e. Maximm utilization of the Cuban refugee elements

1n the US for political and military support without

depending upon their effectiveness for the ultimate success

of the plan.

I. No maldeployment of US forces, affecting the over-all

US military posture, until the final decisive stages of

the plan are ready for execution, thus reducing maldeployment

time.

g. The most economical use of US resources to accomplish

the defeat of Castro communism.

ho A definite time scale of events culminating in the

defeat of Castro's communist government and establishing

the groundwork for the installation of a government compatible

with the aims of the OAS and friendly to the US by 1 october

a. The President was must interested in economic dental

actiong.

Lie was informed that talks would ba undertaken in the

iinmediate future with represchtatives of the Canadian and Britich

governments relative to the supply of spare parts and critical materials

by Canadian and Biitish firme to Cuba. I vas stated that Spanich firms

aro likewise activo in this area, as sell as a number of essentially

ilyaby-night fire located in a number of foreign countries. No

--putable Minerican firms are engaged in aupplying Cuba and, in fact,

rave boon soloul in preventing their forcign affillaten from engaging

a this wraific.

Apparently, State regaids the Canadian, the British

and the Spanish efforts as being the real trouble spote.

The President

directed that State undertake talks, as appropriato, with the governmenta

ul firma concerned to diosuade them from this practice.

b. Under questioning, Ms. FitzGerald stated that exploitation

of Cuban military digaffectiod ip a long term undertaking. While there

aro disaffected Cuban military men in important posts, they have not.

to date, made any contacts with each other nor formed any sort of group.

However, Mr. FitzGerald considers that any succesaful operation tu

overthrow Castro emanating from within Cuba will have to be supported

by the Cuban military if it ia to have any rcal likellhood of success.

c. During the discussion on sabotage and harrassment, the

President expressed his reluctance to undertake high risk actiong at

this time for two reasons:

(1) Current attempta to get OAS agreement to various

sitions directed against Cuba might be jeopardized; and

(2) The Soviets seem to be watching closely the new

administration's policies toward Cuba, and it might influence unfavorably

the succons of our efforte to achieve further reductions in Soviet milltary

personnel in Cuba..

1. Mr. Helma briefed on the significance of the arms cache.

discovered in Venezuela. Mi. Martin bricied upon the activities of

the OAS survey group now in Venezuela and the results, to dato, of

their curvey. He stated that the group apparently had accepted that

ite arras had been introduced for subversive purposes, but that the

survey gioup was asking of the Venezuelan government further informa-

tion regarding propaganda activities directed against the Vonezuelan

government; otc. He does not expect that the commission will report

MEMOR ANDUM FOR THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, ATLANTIC

Subject: A Contingency Plan for a Coup in Cuba (S)

1. Tranemitted herewith is a conceptual proposal, subject as above.

which has been developed jointly by the Department of State, the Depart.

ment of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency:

2. This concept envisions a coup occurring in Cuba which may, it.

supported by. the United States, achieve US national objectives by the

elimination of the communist regime and establishment of a. Cuban

government acceptable to the United States.

3. The proposal provides for US military intervention in a flexible

manner covering a spectrum ranging from provision of logistic support

to full execution of OPLANS 312, and:316.

Conditions under which military

intervention at a level LESS than that of OPLAN 316 might be undertaken

are generally in consonance with those described in JCS Message 8970.

. DTG: 0701552 March 1963.

4. It is desired that CINCLANT prepare a separate contingency plan

to support a coup in Cuba within the context OT conditions described in.

A CONTINGENCY PLAN. FOR A COUP IN CUBA

1, Problem, To provide planning guidance for US response to a coup in

Cube in'order to assure that Us intervention, 1f undertaken, results in

replacement of the Communist goverment with one acceptable to the United

States:

2. Assumptions,

&. The leaders of the coup may or may not be aware, from previous

contact with CIA, that if they agree to and appear capable of meeting

certain specified conditions (see peregraph 2.d. below), their revolt

will be supported by the US 1P a US "special tean" (see paregraph 3.b. (1)

below) confirms that the criteria for support have been adequately met.

Thus, the coup could be triggered in one of two ways: The leaders, in

secure radio contact with CIA, implement their plan with US concurrence

and establish a Provisional Goverrment in full expectation of fortheoming

Us support barring a complete and immediate crushing of the uprising; or,

less acceptably, the Icaders, In the bellef that they can meet probable

criterie for us support, initiate the coup without consulting with or

obtaining the concurrence of the US but establish a Provisional Govern-

went, hoping that the US will intervene.

b. If the US had prior knowledge of the coup, up to forty-eight

hours would be required after initiation of the action to introduce into

Cuba and receive reports from a "special team" which would obtain in-

formation to assist in making a decision to support the insurgents; 1f the

Us did not have prior knowledge, a longer time would be required.

) TOP SECRET ST-

c. US Intervention would be based on:

UNCLASSIFIED

(1) A pre-arranged call for help from a Provisional Government

set un by the insurrectionists (preferably to the OAS, although US action

would it await formal OAS approval), or

(2) A call for help from the insurrectionists after a coup had

started without prior US concurrence, if the us determined that the In-

surgents met generally the criteria for support, or

• (3)

Intervention by local Soviet forces.

d. A coup should meet the following criteria to be supportable,

recognizing that specific

criteria will depend upon t

situation exist.

ent at the time:

(1). Have some power base in the Cuban army or militia in order

to survive.

(2) Be prepared to establish a Provisional Goveriment, however

rudimentary, with some sort of public claim to political viability to

provide an adequate political basis for overt US action (not required 1f

Soviet troops were clearly fighting Cuban patriots).

(3)

Neutralize the top echelon of Cuban leadership.

(4) Seize and hold a significant piece of territory, preferably

Including Havana, long enough to permit the Us plausibly to extend support

and some form of recognition to the Provisional Government.

e. Policy Considerations. For purposes of this paper, Us policy af-

fecting US support to a revolt In Cuba 1a surmarized below.

(1) The US does not contemplate either a premeditated full scale

invasion of Cuba (except in the case of Soviet intervention or the re-

Introduction of offensive weapons) or the contrivance of a provocation

• (2) By the same token, it is not US policy to encourage un-

organized and uncoordinated mass uprisings since these would be too

easily crushed by indigenous Cuban military forces. The likellhood of

any spontaneous uprising surviving long enough to receive adequate US

ald 1s small unless it 16 a part of, or followed immediately by, a

planned and coordinated revolt led by a significant element of the Cuban

military forces.

(3) Once a revolt begins, the involvement of Soviet forces,

either tactical formations or troops manning air defense installations,

would result in immediate implementation of OPIANS 312 and 316.

3. Sequence:: of Operations. The concept of operations set forth in thie

paper 18 based on the following general sequence of events:

a. Upon receipt of word that the dissident leaders have agreed to

and appear capable of meeting the criteria for US support, approval

would be given to commence the coup at the earliest practicable time.

(In theevent that a coup vere initiated without prior Us mowleäge,

the US would proceed as described below but introduction of the special

team into Cuba would probably be delayed and its task of gathering in-

formation made more difficult. Consequently, it might not be possible

for the US to make a decision to support the coup in time to coumit

forces needed to sustain it.)

D. Upon receiving word that a coup had been initiated, either on

a pre-arranged la sis with CIA or as a surprise to the US Goverment, the

us would:

## Page 73

TOP SECRET. sIrE

(1) Introduce into Cuba a "special teem" to obtain information

which would assist in making a decision to support the insurgents. This

tear, composed of several persons

representing DOD, State, and CIA, would

meke contact with the coup leaders within twenty-four hours of the start

of the coup if the US had prior knowledge

of the plan, probably later 1f

not. The report ofthe findings

should be received by CIA within twenty-

four hours after the tean's arrival on the leland but this might not be

possible without prior knowledge of the insurgents' plans. In any event,

American

reliable reports from trained observers in Cuba would be of great value

to making a decision to intervene in order that the US would not conit

Its prestige to the support of an uprising which might collapse prior to

the point at which US help has become effective enough to sustain and

expand it. (The special team, augmented as appropriate by CINCIANT,

would remain in Cuba as a liaison element with the Provisional Govern-

ment if the US Intervened and would be directed to report immediately

to CINCIANT for operational control at the time the decision was made

to intervene.)

(2) Order forces needed to establish an air and sea blockade

of Cuba to take assigned stations in preparation for implementing the

blockade; commence generating and positioning forces required for the

Implementation of CINCLANT OPIANS 312 and 316.

c. A recommendation to intervene, based on a multiple source in-

telligence assessment including the special team's report, would be

made to the President. This would be the critical decision because,

once made, certain actions would ensue immediately and, henceforth,

the US would be cormitted to the ultimate success of the coup. These ac-

tions would include:

(1) The assumption by CINCLANT of cormand of all military

and pare military operations in Cuba.

(2) Prompt introduction of small eroups of personnel: for the

purposes of intelligence, reconnaissance, communications and liaison

with the insurgents, and provision of unattributable logistic support

by airdrop or submarine. In the event that the Us delayed publie an-

nouncement of the decision to support the coup, this assistance would

be provided 1a such a manner as to minimize public knowledge of active

US involvement in Cuba.

(3) When authorized by the President, direct the special team

to have the coup leaders proclaim a Provisional Goverrment, 1f one has

not already been established, and request US and OAS assistance in order

to provide justification for & blockade and consultation within the OAs.

As soon as the request for belp is received, the President would announce

publicly that the US vill isolate Cuba by meane of an air and sea blockade

to become effective at (time, date), The justification for this unilateral,

Interin action would be based on Paragraph 3 ot Resolution 2 of the Punta

del Esta meeting of Foreign Ministers until such time as the COAS/OC es-

tablished a collective basis for the blockade, as well as to insure that

support for either side is not provided from external sources. Actually,

the annourcement would be designed to immobilize the Cuban Navy and Air

Force, encourage indigenous support for the Insurgents, and reinforce a

warning to the Soviet Union not to intervene. (See Paragraph #.a. below).

(4) Complete positioning, of forces

for implementation of por-

tions or all of CINCLANT OPLANS 312 and 316.

d. The US sculd have the option of replying to a formal call for

help by either publicly announcing inmediately its intention to support

the Provisional Goveriment and initiating overt military operations, or

responding by establishing a blockade without admitting other support

for the coup. In the latter case, the US would, between the time of the

Presidential announcement of the blockade and public announcement of the

other forms of support, employ small groups of intelligence and recon-

naissance units, thereby providing visible evidence to the insurgents

that support is forthcoming and yet providing a facade of non-uttervention

while the US consults with its allies to gain their political support.

At the same time, the US would be generating and positioning forces re-

quired for significant overt Illitary operations: Upon publicly announe-

1ng US intent

to support the Provisional Government, the US would initiate

overt logistical and air support to the insurgents. There is a possibility

that this level

of assistance and demonstrated US intent would be suffi-

cient to bring

down the Castro restme, if the coup carried with it a

significant element of the Cuben arned forces.. However, it is probable

that the US would have to introduce conventional forces incrementally as

required to sustain the uprising and should be prepared to and would im

plement portions or all of CINCIANI OPIANS 312 and 316, as required.

submission suitable only for planning purposes. They are

arranged neither oronologically nor in ascending order.

Together with similar Inputs from other agenoles, they are

Intended to provide a point of departure for the development

of a single, Integrated, time-phased plan. Such a plan would

permit the evaluation of Individual projects within the context

of cumulative, correlated aotions designed to lead Inexorably

to the objective of adequate justifloation for Us milltary

Intervention in Cuba).

1. Since it would seem desirable to use legitimate

provocation as the basis for US military Intervention in Cuba

a cover and deception plan, to Inolude roquisite preliminary

aotions such as has been developed In response to Task 33 6,

could be executed as an Initial effort to provoke Cuban

reactions. Harassment plus deceptive aotions to convinde the

Cubans of Imminent invasion would be emphasized. Our military

posture throughout execution of the plan will allow a rapid

change from exeroise to Intervention 1f Cuban response Justifles.

2. A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned

to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine

appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces.

a. Inoidente to establish a credible attack (not in

ohronological order):

(1) Start rumors (many). Use clandestine radio.

(2) Land friendly Cubans In uniform "over-the-fence"

to stage attack on base.

(3) Capture Cuban (friendly) saboteurs inside the

base.

(4) Start riots near the base main gate (friendly

Cubans).

(5) B1ow up amminition Inside the base; start fires.

(6) Burn atroraft on alr base (sabotage).

(7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base Into base.

(8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea

or violnity of Guantanamo City.

(9) Capture militia group which storms the base.

(10) Sabotage ship In harbor; large fires - napthalene.

(11) Sink ship near harbor entrance. Conduot funerals

for mook-vlotime (may be Ileu of (10)).

b. United States would respond by executing offensive

operations to secure water and power supplles, destroying

artillery and mortar emplacements which threaten the base.

0. Commence large soale United States military operatione.

3. A "Remember the Maine" Ineident could be arranged in

several forms:

a. We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and

blame Cuba.

b. We could blow up a drone (urmanned) vessel anywhere

In the Cuban waters. We could arrange to cause such Inoident

in the violnity of Havana or Santiago as a spectacular result

of cuban attack from the alr or sea, or both. The presence

of Cuban planes or ships merely Investigating the intent of

the

vessel could be fairly compelling evidence that the ship

was taken under attaok. The nearness. to Havana or Santiago

would add credibility espeolally to those people that might

have heard the blast or have seen the fire. The US could

follow up with an air/sea resoue operation covered by US

fighters to "evacuate" remaining members of the non-existent

orew. Casualty. lists In US newspapers would cause a helpful

wave of national indignation.

4. We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in

the Miami area, in other Florida oftles and even in Washington.

The terror campaign oould be pointed at cuban refugees seeking :

haven in the United States. We could sink a boatload of Cubans

enroute to Florida (real or simulated). We could foster attempte

on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to the

extent of wounding in Instances to be widely publloized.

Exploding a few plastio bombs In oarefully ohosen spots, the

arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents

substantlating Cuban Involvement also would be helpful in

projecting the idea of an irresponsible goverment.

5. A "Cuban-based, Castro-supported" filibuster could be

simulated against a neighboring Caribbean nation (in the vein

of the 14th of June Invasion of the Dominican Republio). We

Know that Castro 1s baoking subversive efforts clandestinely

against Haiti, Dominican Republlo, Guatemala, and Nicaragua at

present and possible others. These efforts can be magnified and

additional ones contrived for exposure. For example, advantage

oan be taken of the sensitivity of the Dominican Al. Force to

Intrusions within their national air space. "Cuban" B-26 ox

C-46 type sircraft could make cane-burning raids at night.

Soviet 3l00 Indendiarles could be found. This could be coupled

with "Cuban" messages to the Communist underground in the

Dominican Republio and "Cuban" shipments of arms which would

be found, or Intercepted, on the beach.

6. Use of MIG type airoraft by US pilote could provide

additional provocation. Harassment of o1v1l air, attaoks on

surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aireraft

by MIC type planes would be useful as complementary actions.

An F-86 properly painted would convince air passengers that they

saw a Cuban MIG, especlally if the pilot of the transport were

to announce such fact. The primary drawbaok to this suggestion

appears to be the security rick inherent in obtaining or modify

Ing an afroraft. However, reasonable copies of the MId could

be produced from US resources in about three monthe.

should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the

8. It da possible to create an incident which will demonstrate

conviningly that a luban atroraft has attaoked and shot down

a chartered o1v1l airliner enroute from the United States to

Jama108, Guatemala, Panama or Venezuela. The destination would

The passengers could be a group of college studente off on a

a. An afroraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and

numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered

9. It is possible to create an 1noident which will make 1t

appear that Comminiat Cuban

• MIGs have destroyed a USAF atroraft

over International waters in an unprovoked attack.

a. Approximately 4 or 5 F-101 airoraft w1ll be dispatohed

In tra11 from Homestead APB, FlorIda, to the vlolnity of cuba.

Their mission will be to reverse course and simulate fakir

alroraft for an ali defense exeroise in southern Florida,

These afroraft would conduct varlations of these flights at

frequent Intervals. Crens would be briefed to remain at

leant 12 miles off the Cuban coast; however, they would be

required to carry live ammunition in the event that hostile

actions were taken by the Cuban MIG.

' D. On one such flight, a pre-briefed pilot would fly

tall end Charley at conaiderable Interval between atroraft.

While near the Cuban Island this pilot would broadoast that

he had been jumped by MIds and was going down. No other

oalls would be made. The pilot would then fly directly

weat at extremely low altitude and land at a secure base, an

Eglin auxillary. The airoraft would be met by the proper

people, quiokly stored and given a new tall number. The

pilot who had performed the mission under an allas,. would

resume his proper identity and return to his normal place

of business. The pllot and aireraft would then have

disappeared.

O. At precisely the same time that the aircraft was!

presumably shot down a submarine or small surtave craft

would disburse F-101 parte, parachute, eto., at approximately

15 to 20 miles off the Cuban coast and depart. The pilots

returning to Homestead would have a true story as far as

they knew. Search ships and airoraft could be dispatohed

and parts of airoraft found.

THE PROBLEM

1. As requested by Chief of Operations, Cuba Projeot, the

Joint Chiefs of Staff are to indicate brief but preoise

description of pretexts which they consider would provide

justification for US military Intervention in Cuba.

FACTS BEARING ON THE PROBLEM

2. It 18 recognized that any aotion which becomes pretext

for US military Intervention in Cube will lead to a polltical

decision which then would lead to military aotion.

3. Cognizande has been taken of a suggested course of

action proposed** by the US Navy relating to generated

Instances in the Guantanamo area.

4. For additional faots see Enolosure B.

DIESCUSSION

5. The suggested coursegof action appended to Enclosure A

are based on the premise that US military Intervention wi11

result from a period of heightened US-Cuban tensions which

place the United States In the position of suffering justif-

Lable grievances. World opinion, and the United Nations

forun should be favorably affected by developing the inter-

national image of the Cuban goverrment as rash and Irresponsible,

and as an alarming and unprediotable threat to the peace of

the Western Hemisphere.

6. While the foregoing premise can be utilized at the

present time it will continue to hold good only as long as

there can be reasonable certainty that US military intervention

In Cuba would not directly Involve the Soviet Union. There 18

in Cuba in the pattern of US bases in Western Europe. Therefore,

since time appears to be an important factor in resolution of

the Cuba problen, all projects are suggested within the time

frame of the next few monthe.

CONCLUSION

7. The suggested courses of action appended to Enclosure A

satisfactorily respond to the statement of the problem. However,

these suggestions-should be forwarded as a preliminary submission

suitable for planning purposes, and together with similar Inputs

on 7 March 1962, as follows:

" .. - determination that a credible Internal

SECRET

While we generally concur with the paper prepared by the

Department of State, we do not believe that the proposals contained

therein present a sufficiently wide spectrum of options or activities

to impedo and stop Castro/Communist subversion In Latla America.

Specifically, we recommend the following additional actions:

(1)

Measures to attrit Cuban resources:

(a) Purchase the defection of personnel,

aircraft, ships, boats and other valuable items.

16) Conduct non-attributale actiony againes

petroleum resources, upon which much of Cuba's economy depends.

These actions should extend all the way from direct destruction to

sabotage through chemical and bacterial contamination of carriers

and storage.

(c) By means of intelligence indications (aircraft

flights, agente, clear radio transmission, beach jumpers) cause Cuban

military forces to stand continually at high alert level and thus. to

consume supplies which could otherwise be dedicated to subversive

training.

(d) Connider introduction of counterfelt currency

in large quantities, to distort the Cuban financial posture, and to

undermine confidence.

program, including the following:

An intensified and broadened news and propaganda

(a) Underwrite, as necessary, and conduct

an information program within each country in Latin America using

those themes:

1. An exposition of acts on subversive

training, movement of subverives and general subversive' programs.

2 Objectives of the Communists within

each country.

3. Communist methode of operation.

4. Facts on the decrease in living standards

within Cuba since the rise of Castro.

5. Facta on terror and repression in Cuba.

(b) Develop a Pro-American Anti-Communist Press

Many Latin American papers, even the anti-

communist ones, are infiltrated by communist agents and many of their

columnists, proof-readers and linotypers are bought with communist

money. Circulation of these papers in artificially inflated by low prices

and underwritten by communist funds. The United States must match

this financial investment in news control in order to convey the truth

to the Latin who, like the American, believes what he reade:

(c) Distribute Anti-Communit Literature

Booke and pamphlets, in large numbers,

exposing the reality of communiam should be printed in Spaniah and

Portuguose and distributed through inexpensive commercial sale.

(4)

Greatly expanded training and orientation in the

United States for key segments of each Latin Americas country's

population, such an:

(a) Enlisted as well as officer military personnel

to be schooled in Panama and/or the United States.

(b) Police personnel to be schooled in Panama

or in the United States.

(c) Newspaper personnel to be schooled within

the United States.

(d) Nurses (male and female). to be trained in the

United States.

(e) Civilian technicians to be trained in United

taking place in the United States, in not just to emhance the skill and

IX.A.3-d. General. Pressures to Create a Contingency

In order to accomplish the overthrow or reorientation of the Cuban

regime without harming the United States Image and with minimm distortion

of bilaterel US-USSR relationahips, there must be careful coordination and

phasing of our future actiona and demeanor. There must be a plan capable

Of getting us from where we are now to where we want to go, by gradually

Increasing pressures until the objective 1e achieved. These pressures

should be designed to create opportunities and contingency situations

for further exploitation, along the way.

The optimm orchestration of such e Cuban program must obviously be

developed as the future unfolde. But in order to provide overall guidance

within this Goverment, a plan tracing the mainstreams of effort 1s required.

This plan Is divided Into eight headings with a gradually Increasing level

of effort described under each of those headings. The progress through

the various phases 1e visualized as taling place In & coordinated but not

necessarily symetrical mnner. In other words, we may be in the most

vigorous phase of propaganda while not yet having reached the final phase

with regard to subversion but nonetheless the decision to proceed to the

respective phase in either category would be coordinated as ipart of an

overell govermental orchestration.

A program scenario capable of producing a decisive change or

exploitable contingeney over an 18-month period follows.

US Posture • Initially the US image should be that of willingness

to do all that is necessary to keep Castro's military threat nil end his

subversive threat to the lestern Hemisphere at an acceptably low level.

It should be characterized as one during which the USG, having been.

extremely reasonable despite Castro's intransigence, 1s walting for signs

of more favorable change In Cube-

• Iater the US image should change to one in which the US is being

"Zed" by the majority of the CAS Into CAS initiated and sponsored

pressures against Cube. These would consist of measures less than those

certain to overthrow Castro but going beyond the earlier measures, 1n

the expectation that resulting internal pressures might eliminate Castro

Or provide an occasion for decisive ection. Pressures would be applies

In such fashion as to represent both a carrot to the Cuban people to get

r1d of Castro regime and a stick toward the present rogime. Still later

the US stance should become publicly, "at last" to join the CAS majority

1n seeking vigorous pressures on the Castro regime without yet Irrevocably

committing US prestige to decisive action.

Finally, 11 and when the orchestration and circumstances have

brought the US position to such a point that decisive action 1s possible,

be an Invasion by US forces and could be re-imposition of total blockade

or & disarning airstrike, dependent on the circumstances.

DAS Action - - The UBC will need to devote major attention to the

strengthening of the solidarity of the CAS as a source of regional

opposition to the Castro regime. These efforts should go forward openty

along several lines, quite apart from the covert effort to organize the

majority on specifie issues. This effort to achieve solidarity should

consist of frequent briefings of the 015 nations through all appropriate

channels, Consultative Meetings of Foreign Ministers of the CAS, efforts

to set up an 0AS military organization with occasional coumitment of troops

for training, and all other feasible developments of regional themes, such

as Intensive efforts to build up the counterinsurgency capabilities of the

region. - It Is very necessary, In view of the general IA situation to

contime all measures necessary to isolate Castro.

Initial OAS action should be the enlargement of the bases for the

Invocation of the Rio Ireaty. This broadening should be against the con-

timed presence of Soviet troops (unless negotiations with the USSR Indicate

that this aspect should be deferred) and/or against Castro's contimed

subversive activlty. Concomitantly, the recent study of the Special

Consultative Committee on Security should be given wide publicity and

the US should press for implementation of its recommendations,

The OAS, In the near future, probably after publication of the results

of the foregoing study and enlargement of the basis for invoking the Rio

Treaty to include subversion, should again formally warn Cuba against

promotion of any more subversive activities. The AS should formally

.. state that should Cuban subverslve activities rise above some (unspecified)

level, & "new condition" would exist which voild justify decisive action

agathet Cuba. All episodes of subversion or sabotage which could be

attributed to Castro should be highly publicized. The majority DAS support

should be organized to neutralize the Brazilian co-existence theme.

Bilateral approiches and economic quid pro quos should be used to win

Brazil to the U.S. view within OnS.

St111 Inter, at an appropriate time, the DAS should make an official

finding, from Its studies Initioted earlier, that the Castro regine has

continued, despite warnings, to conduct aggressive and subversive actions

"L 1n Iatin America. A sumery publication of subversive activities or

Waste Paper should be promugeted through the CAS. Later a "new condition"

should be found formally to exist, following which the Us would state

that the earlier US-USSR modus vivendi regarding Cuba has come to an end.

Following the above, an AS vote should call for the remaining IA nations

to sever diplomatic relations with Cuba and for all members to restrict

their nationale from travel to Cuba. Castro should be officially labeled

as a major threat to the hemisphere and to the objective of the Alljance

for Progress:

The OAS night then declare that Cestro's subversive activity constitutes

warlike activity and proclaim a prohibition against any warlike activity

being conduated by Cuba within an ocean and land area around the entire In

continental and Caribbean area. Intervention of aircraft and ships

carrying arms, subversive agents, propaganda materials, eto. could be

authorized.

Rio Pact, to punish Castro's aggression. This action could take the

form of a resolution for all members to take such action Including the

use of force as individually considered appropriate or to endorse any

specific decisive action to which the members had agreed.

The USO should brief its Allies on the views of the CAS and warn that

the situation my set vorse, later, as e result of "OAS Insistence" the

Free World should be urged to extend or re-afflen trade embargos to all

Items except food stuffs, medleines, and medical supplies; to apply shipping

restrictions; NATO should be persuaded to Include Cuba on the list of

countries to which shimment of COCOM List (strategic) Items 1s prohibited;

free world Industrial nations should be dissunded from shipping to Cuba

crucial spare parts and equipment which are not on the CoCal list.

Still later the US should Increase the vigor with which she seeks,

through. briefings, pressures, etc., to increase the effectiveness of all

economie measures and should seek to persuade all non-bloe nations to

Limit their airline services to Cuba and to withhold transit rights to

Soviet atreraft serving Cuba. At an appropriate polat in the orchestration,

food stuffs should be added to the prohibited trade liat, with US using

1ts Influence to extend this embargo throughout the Free World. .

The ultimate extension of economic actions, would be the application

of a blockade to Cuba. This could be a phased weapon consisting or a

blockade on FOL, with the prospect of total blockade to follow.

Survetllence over Cube - Until it becomes apperent thet the Soviet

Union has no intention of removing any additional military personnel,

aerial surveillance should be limited to appropriate higa altitude

coverage with low level survelllance avoided except for thoroughly

suspicious Indications.

Iater, at a suitable point in the orchestration, occasional low

altitude survelllance of "suspicious" areas should be undertaken in such

fashion as to be clearly visible to the Cuban people; while avoiding

NA defenses:

St1)] Inter, sultably timed, the United States/QAS should initiate

very. frequent low altitude surveillance. This should be increased in

Intensity to the point at which our aircraft would llterally seek out

AA defense sites in search of provocative acts or, in the absence of

Cuban reaction, to deflate Castro's image.

In any decisive action at the end of the road, surveillance should

be

at saturation levels.

Regional Survelllance . The QAS or the Caribbean nations should take

the Initiutive in organizing, ss a part of a Caribbean security arrange-

rent, a surface ship and sertel surveillance of the coastal and offshore

waters of the Caribbean nations. These patrols should be progressively

moved out from the shores of the nations being protected into the Caribbean

approaches to cuba, tying In with an CAS proclalmed zone In which novement

end of the crescendo, they should operate close to the shores of Cube.

There should be Increasing surveillance and control of land boundaries.

There should be improved systematic exchange of intelligence on sub'ersive

activity.

Propaganda - There should be established Immediately a redio station

(Radio Free Cuba), probably In Floride, using covert funds, with

rogularly scheduled Cuban broadcasts available to all Cuban political

groups. Its content should be the midale converse between VOA and

Radio Swan.

Initially, through public statements, VOA, atc-, maintain the

theme of the U.S. "watchful wilting" fox change in the Castro reglme.

Maintain the currently enhanced VOA wave factlity beamed to Cuba: High-

should warn Cuba unofficially through the suggested Radio Free Cuba of the

power on a pledge to provide political freedom. Remind them of the social

goals he held up while he destroyed that freedom. Contrast their present

economic chaos with those econone goals of land and housing reform.

Remind them that he preached nationalism while delivering their country

accompanied by the destruction of earlier ones. Ask what Castro has loft

It should be emphasized to the reich lenders that the U.S. does not expect

the clock to be turned back with regard to social conditions.

Still later & complete orchestretion should be woven together,

coming to & crescendo through the optimal exploitation

of all the moin-

strears discussed in the categories above. Propagenda should reach the

marian denunciation of the regime, exhorting to revolt, holding up the

prospect of peace and a better life should the Cuben people Join their

one or two months when it 18 apparent that no further Soviet nilitary

lasting for a period of two to three months, until some episode of

(Pa-pared for tha leating of _ February - 1963, 4 Po.)

Coordinator of Cuba Affairs

SUBJECI: Psychological Progran in Support of UoS. Policy on Cuba

Objectives

The basic program adopted by the Executive Conmittee on January

25, 1963 sets forth major objectives for our policy toward Cuba. It ali

conmits us to "be prepared to incroase the political, economic, paycho-

logical and military pressures, as appropriate opportunities present

themselves. or can be created.""

This memorendum outlines a program that will meet the psychologica.

requirements of our overall policy.

Role of Psychological Operations

A successful psychological campaign cannot be viewed solely as a

propaganda exercise of an informational program. It should cover actio.

and statements all that is said or done solely or primarily for psycho:

logical eftect.

This definition sets off psychological activities fron

those actions undertaken primarily for their direct value--whather in t

fields of intelligance, nilitary, political, or economic action.

to balance possibly conflicting interests and to determine which, in any

given circumstance, shall have priority.

Strategy and Tactics

ve must keep in mind constantly the relationship between what happens

in Cuba and the overall struggle between ourselves and the Communtate.

We should seek to Insure that the Cuban situation will davelop in a way

that will:

a) lead to the collapse or overthrow of the Castro regime;

b) demonstrate to the Cuban people and to the world at large that

communism la not a solution for the problems of a developing

country;

c). discredit Castro and his associates and their methods of opera-

tion throughout the Americas;

d) insure that the burden imposed by Cuba on the Soviet Union and.

the satellites adds substantially to the mounting evidence that

efforts to export communist revolution are unsuccessful and ex-

cessively costly.

Our focus should always be on the first of these objectives--the

end of the commnist regime in Cuba. But pending achievement of enis,

wa can nove toward the other objactives. And they, after all, are of

major Importance to our overall strategic purposes.

(A)

Wla have the possibility of Insuring that so long as Cuba remaina

Comunist it will serve as an open, bleeding wound that will weaken the

Communist cause generally. This stratagic concept is one which the

Communists have tried to use against us.

Our tactical approach should be designed to fit this overall concept.

It calls for the ulllization of every available weapon in our aresenal

and engagement, day-in and day out, in a multi-faceted struggle at all

lovels.

Our inftial aim should be to weaken steadily the capability, con-

fidence and will of the enemy (inside and outside Cuba) and, correspond

ingly, to strengthen our side. We need not, indeed ought not, stake every-

thing on one great effort. Nor should we concentrate on simply building

up our forces and husbanding them "until the right time cones" for a final

showdown..

Instead, our effort should be directed toward achieving an unbroken

serles of small successes, encompassing gains on the part of anti-Castio

elements and failures on the part of the regime Itself. Our aim should

be that the end of each day would see the position and prospects of the

Castro regime and little worse than they had been at sunrise.

"rat hole" operation. The "example of Cuba" would become the reverse of

expectations; fidelismo would become a term of opprobrium.

regime without resort to direct and massive force. We cannot rule, our

problem are submitted in Annexes A and B.

fanciences and Targets

The psychological program should be directed at the following primary

audiences or target groups:

1) the Cuba people. Our goal should be to encourage dissatisfaction

with the present and hope for the future once Castroism is ell

ainminated. It should be made clear that the next chapter of Cuba's

history must be written by the Cubans. But they should know that

they will have friendly support from others.

2) tha Castro regime. Our goal should be to create dissension, doubl

and hopelessness inside the ruling clique.

3) Latin Americe. In profesin directed at the peoples and govern-

ments of the hemisphere, our goal should be to weaken the influ-

ence of the Cuban regima and its propaganda, to encourage solid-

arity within the OAS family, to counter Cuban Influence In key

groups (youth, labor, Intellectuals), to encourage actions that

counteract Cuban programs of subversion and insurrection.

4) she Soviet Union and other. Communist states. To picture Cuba

as a steady drain on already limited resources, to insure that 1

eliminate their involvement in Cuba.

5) Other countries. To insure understanding of what is involved

in the Cuban situation, to use Cuba to disprove that communism

provides useful answers to the needs of developing countries,

to espose. the continuing danger of communist efforts to export

revolution.

6) the Home Base. To provide the American people and the Congress

with the full facta of the Cuban situation within the limits of

legitimate security considerations.

Assets.

The psychological program toward Cuba should utilize the full range

of the Cavernment's capabilities for action and infornation, These in-

clude, among others: a) public statements by the President and other

officials;

b) Informational assets such as the public affairs an

Congressional relations agencies of State,

Defense and otber agencies;

c) the Covernment's research and analysis facilities;

d) overseas information programs in all media,

especially the facilities of the U.S. Information

Agency;

e) the diplomatic mechanism for both formal and

informal contacts;

E) capabilitles for unattributed programs of action

and Info-pation.

cus-dination and Guidance

I: carrying out the kind of many-sided offensive described herein,

it will ba necessary to provide for coordinating various programs. We

must de sure that what we do in one area reinforces what we do elsewhere.

It will be necessary to provida careful end regular policy guidance to

those responsible for action. This task is assigned to the Coordinator

for Cuban Affairs. He should establish the necessary machinery os an

Inter-departmental basis.

U.S. Posture towerd Cube

The picture we should seek to create is one of a confident and de

cisive United States moving foxward in cooperation with its other fftands,

dealing with the Cuban situation but not exclusively preoccupied with

Castro. We should not appear to be in doubt or confusion. We should take

note of developments In Cuba promptly and react to them quickly. Oux

answer to claims, charges or attacks should be swift. Our machinery mist

be gearad' to permit answers to Castro and his henchmen Immediately and

effectively. If he makes a speech tonight, our reply should be on the

al-waves tomorrow at the latest.

Cur approach should not be dafensive. We should not contine ourselve

to casuaring Castro but as much as possible force him onto the defensive.

Wa should insure that he is required to do the answering, the explaining,

the disagreeing so wuch as possible.

laining overall U.S. policy toward the Cuban question. It would provide

clarification of where we stand on Cuba and how 'we hope to see the future

cavelop. It would provide the basis for statements, private and public,

for all other officials concerned. It would inform the Cubans how we re

gard their future; tell' Latin Americans how we see the problem and our

view of their role; underline'to the Sovlet bloc our determination to

oppose communism in thie hemisphere; further clarify for our own people

the seriousness of the problem and our determination to support the cause

of freedom in Cuba with all feasible means.

The Coordinator should arrange for preparation of such a statement

and submit a draft to the White House.

2. It 1s our policy to seek elimination, or at least naterial re-

duction, of the soviet military presence in Cuba. Efforts now underway

to achieve this end should be given a reasonable chance. If they fail

to produce the desired result within a reasonable time, we ahould be pre

pared to sova forward along other lihes. The Coordinator

should develop

of Sovie: forces should be descrited as an exacerbating influence in

East-west relations and a symbol of foraign domination and control in Cuba.

ragard invasion of Cuba by the United States as a desirable or useful

course. But the possibility of such action in given circumstances cannot

The door should be left open for any action that we and

our allies in the hemisphere may regard as necessary in the future to

counter aggressive moves by the Cuban regime.

# We need to have clearly in mind our position regarding a possi

bie Internal revolt. Tils, too, could ba covered in 1 above. We should

avoid statements for the present which could reasonably be expected to

encourage an open revolt. We should avoid for the present anything that

could be read as a flam pledge to come to the aid of anyone who moves

¿guinst Castro. We should male clear, however, that we are prepared to

support and cooperate with any elements who succeed in ending comnist

dominance in Cuba and who are cormitted to establishing in Cuba a free

/and democratic government responsive to. the destres of its own people.

a well as many of those programs proposed for the future. It

may be necessary to address this proposal or a similar proposal

separately and in advance of the policy study; however, in the

event no pressing requirement exists, it is suggested that this

proposal be considered in conjunction with the policy study and

handled on a closely held basis.

REASON FOR PROPOSAL

Following ate listed a number of indications that the leader-

ship question will be addressed in the near future:

Revolutionary Wife a tim at u. patto ta Cuban

exile groups in the U.S. and elsewhere will be vying for recognition

and support in an attempt to fill this void.

b. There has been constant pressure on the U.S.

of this political and psychological pressure.

C. This proposal could serve to reduce the bickering

among exile groups and may serve to resolve some of the problems

of Cuban exile unification.

.. The proposal could emphasize the development o

" native "'David" in opposition to Castro, the Cuban "Goliath." Thi

could serve the U.S. image by making Castro the "Goliath" rather

than the "David" who opposes the "North American Giant. "

e. This proposal could serve to prevent the U.S. from

making premature commitments to a leader or a particular exile group

and could be used as a device to test exile response.

This proposal could retain for the U.S. the ability

to control future selections of leadere or groups (timing and political

ideologies).

§. This proposal could permit the U.S. on a progres-

sive basis to influence the idealogies of the resistance and thus to

Influence the platform of a future Cuban Government.

"he publicity associated with the prolonged existenc

f a restatance in Cuba can serve to delay the furtherance of the d

facto recognition of the present Cuban Regime.

OBJECTIVE

To create an imaginary leader or image of resistance in Cuba.

This image would sexve as a focal point for resistance directed against

Castro by Cubans or Latin Americans.

DEVELOPMENT

An imaginary name of a resistance leader could be developed

to determine this name.

"The Little Bull, " "The Little Worm,"

"The Friendly. Worm," "The Fighting Friend," "The Tough Peasant,"

or any such name which is acceptable and meaningful in Spanish

could suffice. Over a period of several months the name could be

"dropped" or leaked through U.S. officialdom, in diplomatic channels,

in intelligence channels or within the Cuban exile community. Specific

acts against the Regime could be credited to this individual or mem-

bers of his group. Communicationa could be arranged between thie

individual and his subordinates to be picked up either by Castro's

censors or by radio intercept in Cuba or in the U. S.

After a perlod of time, all unexplained incidents and actions

for which credit has not been seized by some other exile group would

automatically be ascribed to our imaginary friend. At some point in

lime it could be leaked that the U.S. is, in fact, supporting this

imaginary person.

Similarly, other Latin American countries may,

without inducement, publicly follow the U.S. pattern.

During the course of this operation it la quite possible that the .

Castro Regire could indicate that the activities of this individual were

terminated, that the individual was captured, that he was being pur -

sued, or that he was an imaginaty faker or fraud. Such action would

only serve to further publicise the actions of the individual and so long

as resistance in general continued the fame of our "Cuban Kilroy"

would spread. Humorous antica could be credited to our imaginary

friend and rumors of his exploite of bravery (ala Zoro) could be

circulated.

At some point in time it may be wise to indicate what this

individual stands for.

(It will become obvious that he is opposed to

the Regime in Cuba.) It could be possible to indicate little-by-little

his political platform in very general terms - realizing that the

mistique and the "generalness" connected with his operation is, in

fact, the power behind the operation. Ultimately, Cubane and othera

may demand that he proclaim his complete political views or even

that he present himself physically. Since this is not desirable,

could be relayed to the public by many means.

or those who are unwilling to accept his leadership. The lines of

controveray among exiles can be drawn more clearly. Undesirable

leaders and exile groups can be eliminated from the competition

through his disavowals.

leadership ability and the ability to "fill the boots" of this anti-Castro

While this scheme is replete with gimmickery, its imple-

mentation could be undertaken in a relatively short period of time.

Sensitivity of this scheme is such that the knowledge should be held

on the tightest basis and if implemented, those proposing should

not be informed. In the event the scheme is compromised, (unless

knowledge is widespread) there is little need for plausible deniability;

however, once used and compromised the scheme can hardly be

reinstated. A major advantage in that this image can be created

over a long period of time or developed rapidly without a political

or economic commitment on the part of the U.S. There may be a

point at which the U.S. could no longer disavow collaboration with

this imaginary person. This point, however, is so distant that

during any point in the intervening period it would be possible for

the U.S. to disengage easily without suffering embarrassment or

loss of prestige.

## Page 183

13-00000

CONCLUSION

Based on a consideration of factors indicated above, it

appears that the U.S. should immediately undertake to implement

this proposal, determining at 30 to 60 day future intervale what

additional action should be taken to improve, reduce, or change

the image during the subsequent 30 or 60 day period.

it to such expressions as "the worm will turn" - 11 appliemble In Cuba

and associating it will biblical quotations such an "Their worm shall

not die, and thelr fire shall not be quenched" - Isa 6624 or "As a moth

doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood, so the sadness of a man

conumeth the heart" - Prov. 25. 20. USIA to take action.

COMMENT:

In the two previous meeting. I have developed silicient sapport

so that I can now get setions taken witiont too much question. Thin

next meeting i propose to introduce a nystem of suspense daten no that

the "we are looking into" or "we are conaldering" are replaced by

"ye will meet the muspenne" - this may be difficult at firet, but feel

it can be managed.
