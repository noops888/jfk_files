In a private conversation on 4 May 1964 a member of the Frente

de Obreros Revolucionario Cubanos (FORC, Front of Revolutionary

Cuban Workers) claimed that the following exile groups were

conniving to take action against Cuba within the next few months:

the Junta Revolucionaria, Cubana (JURE

• Cuban Revolutionary Junta,

the Movimiento de Recuperacion Reoricionaria (MRE,

Movement for

Revolutionary Recovery); the Ejercito Rebelde En

/ Rebel. Army) ;

"Alliance" of the Movimiento Revolucionario Popular (MRP,

Popular Revolutionary Movement), the Segundo Frente Nacional del

Escambraz

(SENE, Second National Front of the Escambray, and

Alpha 66.

2..

JURE, the ER, and the "Alliance" were planning to encer Cuba to

prepare the groundwork for internal insurrection, white the MRR

to carry

out diversionary hit-and-run attacks on

the Cuban

coasts.

Meanwhile, the FORC was building up its own clandestine

organization among the workers in Cuba; its aim is to organize

sabotage and slow-downs in Cuban industries, thus paving the way

for an eventual general strike.

FORC claims to have the support

of the Confederacion de Trabajadores Venezolanos (CTV, Venezuelan

Workers' Confederation) and of the Confederacion Latinoamericana

de

Sindicatos Cristianos

(CIASE, Latin American Christian Trac:

Union.)
