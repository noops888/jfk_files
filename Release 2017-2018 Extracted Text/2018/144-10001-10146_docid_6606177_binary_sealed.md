PROPOSED RESPONSE TO MR. BLAKEY FROM. MR. KESTER

Dear Mr. Blakey:

This letter is in reply to your letter of 15 November 1978 to Secretary

Brown, requesting certain information relating to the investigation of the

assassination of President Kennedy.

Cognizant elements of the Department of Defense have made a thorough and

detailed search in an attempt to find records which might relate to the matters

as recently discussed between you and Ms. Miller of my office.

The search efforts included discussions with individuals familiar with

relevant operational procedures existing during the 1963 time frame, a review

of records of stored files that might be applicable. to your inquiry, and a

physical review of specific records in warehouse storage (recognizing that

most records from this period no longer exist).

The search efforts described above revealed no information relevant

to your request.

Sincerely,

JOHN G. KESTER

On 8 November, Mr. Robert G. Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director

for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, posed a number of questions to

NSA regarding a former Air Force enlisted man's allegation that he had intercepted

information linking an assassination plot against President Kennedy with a figure

in organized crime.

Mr. Blakey subsequently submitted a written request (dated

15 November) to support his verbal one.

In essense, the questions probed NSA's ability to quickly and thoroughly

probe for records from the Air Force site in Kirknewton, Scotlana (USA-55,

now closed), for information relating to the allegation.

G809 and N33 personnel reviewed both a listing of data and boxed records

from USA-55, but their efforts failed to reveal evidence of the alleged incident.

The actual traffic from this period was minimal and no other records are extant.

The Director has approved.
