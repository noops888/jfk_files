RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONAL USE OF CERTAIN
CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS

Rescission: CST 50-10, 13 July 1970

1. GENERAL

a. Elemental in the conduct of clandestine operations is the use of human
agents to accomplish the missions of the Operations Directorate. In gen-
eral, it is DDO policy to select agent assets with primary regard to the
agents’ abilities, target access, and security, and with few restrictions as
to their origins, professions or status as members of particular groups. The
basic rule is that any consenting adult may be used by the Operations
Directorate. There are, however, certain ‘sensitive categories of individuals
‘or groups whose operational use by the Operations Directorate is prohibited
Gr in some way restricted for reasons not necessarily. related to security
considerations,

b, These prohibitions or restrictions stem from one of the following:

(1) The Agency has been directed by.U.S. Governméatal, authority to
restrict or avoid the operational use of a particula® category. of in-
dividuals. ae ~

(2) The Agency has entered into a spécial éstrictive agreement with an
organization, government, corporation,. or official responsible for a
category of individuals:

(3) The Director or the Députy” Director for Operations hes imposed
restrictions on the operational us@ of a\certain category of individuals
due to the extreme tisk or sensitivit) SF such exploitation.

2. PURPOSE
‘The purpose of this instruction is to set forth the prohibitions and policy
restrictions (as distinguished from sect strictions) which currently

3. DEFINITIONS 8

Within the context of this instruction, the definitions listed below will apply.
Special note must be taken of the fact that the key term: “operational use” .
employed throughout this instruction has been defined in the most succinct . )
manner consistent with clarity. It has not been feasible, Hioiveves, to. cover in * :
a definition the entire scope of possible variations in operational circumstances
which may be encountered in DDO activities. The definition of “operational
use” is intended to provide guidance for the majority of cases, and must be
employed with responsible operational judgment. Issues involving a deter-
mination of “operational use” which cannot be resolved with reasonable as-
surance by the responsible operating comporents will be referred to. the
Deputy Director for Operations for decision.

a. Operational Use

Operational use is interpreted to mean the recruitment, utilization,
ing of any individual or. group for DDO. purpoies on either a witting or
unwitting basis by or on the behalf of an element of the Operations Direc-
torate, Utilization is madé of an individual or group whenever that in-
dividual or group, responding ‘to the direction or solicitation’ of a DDO
clement, provides iniformation, performs services, piovides cover, or supplies
financial, material, or other support necessary. fof ‘thie accomplishment of
DDO operational objectives either difectly or indirectly, to or for an ele-
ment of the Operations Directorate.

b. DDO Element
Any person or groufwho or which is responsible to, owned or controlled
either directly or indirectly by the Operations Directorate. Included under

this definition are employees jor. members of Agency proprietary mech-
anisms. be

a. GENERAL. There are two categories of contract personne!

and Independent contractors.

(1) CONTRACT EMPLOYEES. Although they are not appointed employees,
contract employees are employees of the U.S. Government. They have all
the rights and privileges granted by law to U.S, Government employees

G tn accordance with thelr citizenship, status as well as those rights and !

privileges specified, in their contracts. They work under supervised con-

+ ditions and ere compensated on a salary.basls, Contract employees are i

grouped into three categories:

(a) Career Assoclate (Type ©) Contract Employees: Contract employees
who perform duties, usually of a clandestine and operational nature,
on a career basis, They are normally required to demonstrate their
operational value to the Agency for not lesxthan three years, in the
case of US. citizens, or not less than tiv ;, in the case of forelgn
nationals, to qualify for career,asspciata\tatuy. When it is necessary

~ . for a carger associate to have the staft-type acess to an Agency instal-

lation or classified Igtdtinatiory he must meet the same security ap-

‘BY Stat employee.
- (b) Internal ¢ ‘1\Coptract Employees: Contract employees, engaged
_ for a specitle(pri0d of time, who normally: work inside Agency instal~
: I lations. They"are required to meet the same security approval criteria ie

Information as is authosized'In. thelr security approval and is required
in the performance'ot their duties. ”- “

(c) External (Type E) Contract Employees: Contract employees, engaged
for a specific period of time, who normally work outside Agency In-
stallations. They are not required to meet the same security approval
erlterla as staff employees and are not permitted the same access
to Agency installations as staff employees or internal contract em-
ployees. They are permitted only such access to classified information
as 1s authorized In thelr security approval and 1s required in the per-
formance of thelr duties.

‘ (2) INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS are not employees of the U.S. Government.

“iduals who are engaged under contract to

- provide specific services. They recetve only the compensation and benefits
considered necessary to retain thelr services, In the Operations Directorate,
thelr duties are normally lmited to historlcal-research and analysis and."~< ~~”
to the direction, utilization, spotting, or support of agents. They normally’...
