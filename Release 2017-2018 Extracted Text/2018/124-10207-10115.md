MIAMI DIVISION

JFK,

nicensate

Information was set forth in memorandum dated August 22,

1963, that Benjamin Bertram Sigelbaum, who is prominent in the

transfer

and distribution of skimmed funds from the Las Vegas gambling casinos,

considered the Swiss banking business to be very lucrative.

stated that the banks lend money to African countries at 12 to 15

per cent

interest and they receive government bonds of these

countries, which, if defaulted, are apparently underwritten by the

U. 'S. Government.

The Director has asked "Just how does this work?"

Theylega. Attache, Bern, has advised that John P. Dimmer,

Chief of Station, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Bern; stated

that he"has no knowledge of

such transactions being made by Swiss

banks and thought sigelbaum's allegations sounded extremely doubtful.

Charles W. Bass, Economics Section, U. 'S. Embassy, Bern}

advised he

has never heard of such loans being made by Swiss

banks He pointed

out that if the U. S. would underwrite against default a loan to

an African country, thenthe African country could easily borrow

money in Switzerland at fivé or six per cent interest instead of 12

to 15 per cent.

to be unlikely.

Bass regarded U. 'S underwriting of African bond&

As set forth in memorandum dated August 27, 1963, in this

matter, Joan Grosvenor, Chier Counsel, Bureau of Public Debty U.SS&

Treasury Department, advised there is no blanket underwriting

foreign government bonds by the U.S. Government, although ru

particular projects in foreign countries may be underwritten
