: Person Interviewed: PAUL RENNARD

1 Address: 1143 Springbrook Avenw
Moosic, Pa.

Date of Interview: January 3, 1958
Place of Interview: Avoca, Pa.

Interviewed by:” SA GEORGE R.- JOHNSON

PAUL RENNARD advised he was employed as a pilot by
the Sullivan Trail Coal Company in March 1957 after he answered
a blind ad in a newspaper for a licensed conmercial pilot.

He said he formerly worked for the Joy Manufacturing Company.
He said he was asked by LOUIS ~PAGNOTTI to take a party of
several people to Binghamton, N. Y., on June 24, 1957. He
_recalled he was told a man and wife would arrive at the Avoca
Airport from Detroit via Allegheny Airlines that date and
that the mn was too sick to travel by automobile from Avoca
to Binghamton. He stated he did meet the plane upon arrival
from Detroit and the passenger and his wife and their baggage
were transferred to the Sullivan Trail plane. He further
advised other passengers on this flight included WILLIAM
MEDICO and two other men, one of whom he thinks was RUSSELL
BUFALINO, He did not know the third man. LOUIS PAGNOTTI
did not accompany these people. .

RENNARD stated he flew the plané to the Tri-City
airport at Endicott, N. Y., and since there was no record of
the flight in the Avoca airport log, he probably made the
flight on instruments after filing an IFP with the local
CAA office. He said that between June 2), 1957 and the date
of the next Incident, September 13, 1957, he was told by
LOUIS PAGNOTTI that the sick man he took to Endicott had died.

a He stated that upon arrival at Endicott, the plane was met
by a young, stocky Italian appearing man in his early twenties

driving a Cadillac Sedan. He said the five passengers were
driven away, but he remained at the airport with the plane.
He added, MSDICO, the man whom he believes was BUFALINO,
and the unknown man returned to the airport and they flew
back to Avoca the same days

RENNARD explained the reason he thinks one of the
passengers on this flight was BUFALINO is that BUFALINO was
definitely involved in the September 13, 1957 indident
and he is positive he recognized him as having been on the
June 24, 1957 flight. He also recalled that PAGNOTTI told him
the sick man from Detroit was a "big shot" but he did not
recall the name, and when the nam ANGELO POLIZZI was mentioned,
he was not sure this was the name he heard.

With regard to_the September 13, 1957 incident,
RENNARD related as follows:

PAGNOTTI called him in the late afternoon of this
day and told him "they". had asked him if his plane could be
used for a flight to Detroit. PAGNOTTI did not further
identify “they."

RENNARD went to the airport and upon checking the
weather, found numerous thunderstorms existed or were forming
between Avoca and Detroit. He said RUSSEL BUFALINO was

, already at the airport waiting for him, and he was accompanied

by several other men, names not known since all but one
remained in their car.

RENNARD was not anxious to make this flight due
to the weather, and informed BUFALINO he would not make the
flight. BUFALINO responded he had to be in Detroit by
8:30 p.m. that night and remarked he had a ticket on the i
Allegheny Airline, but the flight had been cancéled because
of éngine trouble in the plane. RENNARD suggested they go
to Binghamton and take a commercial flight from there.
BUFALINO accepted this suggestion under the impression RENNARD ,
was going to fly them there. However, RENNARD asked him how
long it would take to drive to Binghamton and when he found
out they could make it in 50 minutes, he suggested they drive
since it would take him at least 50 minutes to get the plane
ready to fly and since there were storms there also, he

va

might have difficulty landing, and they might miss their
commercial plane. He said BUFALINO was visibly offended
that RENNARD would not fly them to either Detroit or
Binghamton, and left without shaking hands.

Concerning the November 1), 1957 flight, RENNARD
stated he flew JAMES TEDESCO, an officer in the Sullivan Trail
Company and WILLIAM MEDICO to Bridgeport, Conn., that day. He
said that MEDICO owns a factory in the Bridgeport area and
was trying to sell it to LOUIS PAGNOTTI. He said he flew
on instrument that day, and remained at the Bridgeport
airport while MBDICO and TEDESCO went about their business.

He stated he did not fly to either Endicott or Binghamton
on November 14, 1957. He also stated his own private log
reflected the same departure and arrival times as reflected
in the CAA records,

RENNARD stated he flew the Sullivan Trail plane
to Wilmington, Del., on October 28, 1957, to have a 1,000
hour checkup made on the plane. He said that on October 30;
1957, MYRTHEN MACK, pilot for the Correale Construction
Company, flew that company's Twin-Beech in for the same purpose.
He said he knew MACK personally and that they roomed together
the night of October 30, 1957. At that time, MACK told him

» about a flight he had had the previous day and remarked that

if he, RENNARD, had beon home he would probably have made the
trip himself. He said MACK went on to tell him that on
October 29, 1957, he flew one of his bosses, PALMSR CORREALE,
to Avoca where they picked up LOUIS .PAGNOTTI, WILLIAM MEDICO,
and @ third individual, unknown to him, and they flew on to
Endicott, N. ¥. MACK told RENNARD they were met at the air-
port by a driver with a Cadillac sedan, and driven to a very
palatial home in Apalachin, N. Y., owned by one JOSEPH BARBARA.
MACK. told RENNARD they were served a very sumptous meal and
the wine and scotch flowed "like water." After eating, the
party was shown around the home and the estate, after which
they were driven back to the airport and returned home.

RENNARD said MACK described the affair as "MEDICO's
Party," and that MEDICO had invited both CORREALE and PAGNOTTI
to go along. RENNARD said both PAGNOTTI and CORREALE like
to fly and like to party and that they would go on a pleasure
trip upon instant's notice.

RENNARD said after both he and MACK had been inter-
viewed by MC GROARTY of the Fennsylvania State Police, MACK
called him to discuss the interview. He said MACK told him
at the time he had lied to MC ’GROARTY about the fact PALMER
CORREALR was on the trip because of the publicity regarding |
BARBARA since that tim. At that time he had been interviewed.
RENNARD said he told MACK to tell CORREALE of the interview.
which he did and later MACK told RENNARD that CORREAIE
instructed him to recontact MC GROARTY and tell him the full
facts regarding the flight and who the passéngers were.

RENNARD said he did not tell either PAGNOTTI or
TEDESCO of his interview, and that when discussing it with
PAGNOTTI's private secretary, she told him he should at least
tell TEDESCO and that TEDESCO would in turn inform PAGNOTTI.
He said she further remarked to him that since he, RENNARD,
was new in the area, he did not know the background of "these
people." He said she told him that she had been employe a:
by PAGNOTTI for many years, and that she knew positively he.
had no connection with "those people" meaning BARBARA and
others. She told RENNARD it was true that PAGNOTTI had
loaned money to BARBARA, but it was not true that BARBARA
had at one tim been PAGNOTTI's chauffeur.

‘ RENNARD said that MEDICO hasmade numerous flights
in the Sullivan Trail Company plane. He said many of the
trips were on business for Sullivan Trail but there were
times when it appeared MEDICO had arranged the trip for his
own convenience. He said recently he flew MEDICO and LOUIS
PAGNOTTI, JR., to Saginaw, Mich., to buy som machinery.
PAGNOITI bought two lathes, after which MEDICO tried to get
him to sell one of them to him. RENNARD said he misrepresented
to PAGNOTTI that one of the lathes was not complete and when
he, RENNARD, pointed out it was complete, MEDICO dropped the
subject in a huff.

RENNARD further related another incident which
occurred recently. This time he flew TEDESCO, PAGNOTTI, IRey
and MEDICO to Baltimore to look at machinery. En route they
picked up a man at Reading, Pa., and after looking at the
machinery in Baltimore, flew on to Washington, D. C., where
MEDICO had an appointment. While waiting for MEDICO to
return to the National Airport, RENNARD received a call from

, Docld:32305948 Page 8


PAGNOITI, SR., inquiring when he expected to return to Avoca.
When RENNARD informed him of MEDICO's appointment, PAGNOTTI ,
SR., appeared to be somewhat angry and he told RENNARD he
had some people he wanted flown from Avoca to Philadelphia
and then on to Washington the same day. , RENNARD said when

MEDICO finally returned to the airport, he mentioned his call ©

from PAGNOTTI, SR., and MEDICO immediately inquired who the
people were. His question was overheard by PAGNOITI, JR.
RENNARD said he lmew who his passengers were to be, but he
did not tell MEDICO, and the following day when he spoke to
PAGNOTTI about it, the latter said he was right in not
disclosing the identities of the passengers to MEDICO, and
went on to say that he should not tell MEDICO anything under
any circumstances concerning business of the Sullivan Trail
Coal Company. : 7
