COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Although this employee is a fine intelligence officer and has worked

very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City,

I consider the

of Outstanding in all specific duties and for over-all perfornance to be

excessively high. Reporting on the activities

she supervises hes

as good as that from other Mexico City operations but is still noi up

to DDP standards.

While most of the projecis she, is concerned with are

handled with proper cost consciousness, at least one of them,

Project, is not.

The agents are paid too much and their activities are

not sdequately reported.. This has been called to the station's attention.
