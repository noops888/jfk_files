which are held by DRAGNA for rental income. Investigation

estimated at $60,000 per year.

On May 20, 1965, HART advised that their investi-

gation of CIVELLO,

which has involved numerous surveillances

in the past, has failed to indicate that he has

been in

personal contact with DRAGNA.

HART advised their files contain

no information to indicate that DRAGNA has a close relationship

with CIVELLO other than the fact that they possibly belong to

the Italian-American Club and attend various Italian functions.

Spot surveillances conducted by Bureau Agents have

failed to indicate that CIVELLO is associating with DRAGNA

or that DRAGNA is visiting the Airway Liquor Store owned by

CHARLES CIVELLO.

the opinion that JOHN DRAGNA was the one who tipped off the

individuals concerned, but now he is not sure inasmuch as

any employee of the bank who was aware of the Agent's

presence, could have gassed.on the information.

Informant

advised on his previous contact,

but that he had no proof nor had he received any direct
