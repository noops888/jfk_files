Friend Lee:

Once again I write you since the last time that we saw each other

in Miami. You took the books in Spanish to the hotel and I hardly

have any. I will tell you that the man plans to visit there soon

and you should close the business as soon as possible, as I told

you beforehand in Miami, I recommend much prudence and do not do

any madness with the silver I gave you. I trust you will not

defraud me and that our dreams will be realized. After the

business I will recommend you highly to the Chief who certainly

will be very much interested in knowing you as they need men

like you. I told him you could put out a candle at 50 meters and...

he did not believe me, but I made him believe because I saw you

with my own eyes and the Chief was astonished. Well Lee, practice

your Spanish well for when you come to Havana as this is the land

of liberty, of beautiful women and rich Havana tobacco. Don't

forget to do all that I told you to the letter and do not leave

anything that can be traced etc., and when you receive my letters

destroy them as always. After the business I will send you silver

and we shall see each other here in Miami at the usual place.

Always Sincerely
