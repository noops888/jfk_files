According to statements by a senior CIA officer in 1967, made
to the Inspector General, the Agency was instructed to develop a
capability to conduct assassinations. Termed an "executive action

. capability, ' such a project was ‘initiated in 1961, apparently assuming

an existing cryptonym, ZRRIFLE. At the request of the case officer
(the same officer providing this information in 1967), a clandestine

asset in Europe, QJWIN, was to be used ‘in the project. |The éase

officer understood that QUWIN-had been considered in 1960 for use
in the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, but that the propased
operation was never Carried out because the designated CIA case
officer declined the assignment.

The case officer in charge of ZRRIFLE also was involved in an
operation to assassinate Fidel staal running from early 1962 to
mid-1963. " However, QUWIN was not used i in this effort, reliance
being ‘placed instead on a Cuban exile leader. QJWIN was never
briefed on the Castro operation, according to the officer handling

” ZRRIFLE and the Castro operation.

Records do show that QIWIN was dispatched to the Congo in

1960, being there in November and December 1960, prior to the

death of Lumumba at the hands “of Congolese. However, there is no

evidence to suggest that QUJWIN was in any way involved in Lumumba's
demise. The case officer who was the source of the information of
the contemplated use of QIWIN in such an activity understood that he
was never used in this eee The following information reviews
existing knowledge beyond that summarized above.

A 13 October 1960 dispatch fronq| transmits notes to

headquarters from one of the two officers who subsequently met
QIWIN in Luxembourg. The notes list the names of police officials
and criminal elements and allude to the Pee cimtees of finding safe-
crackers and document-suppliers. : :
QUWIN was met in Luxembourg on 19 and 20 October 1960 by
two Agency officers and was asked if he would undertake a trip to

Africa, presumably Dakar. (The appropriate dispatch, dated

2 November 1960, lists only Luxembourg and las addressees. )

He was not given the true objective of his mission because of its”
extreme sensitivity and pending a final decision to use him. Instead,
he was told that the Soviets were operating in Africa among nationality
groups, specifically Corsicans, and he was being asked to spot,
assess, and recommend some dependable, quick-witted persons for

our use. He agreed to go on the trip. On 2 November QIWIN was

met in Frankfurt by an Agency officer, and he accepted an offer to

proceed to Leopoldville. (P. sésunably he idea for sending him

there originated at headquarters because someone must have
considered him qualified to handle a potential operation there.) The
precise mission was not conveyed to QJWIN, and he was only informed
that the mission might involve a large element of personal risk. We
do not know and at present are unable to determine what the assignment
was. Subsequent cable traffic discusses arrangements for QIWIN to go
first to Leopoldville and then to Dakar.

". Qn 8 December QI WIN was in Leopoldville where he cultivated

2 close personal relationship with a Yugoslav Air Force pilot: _ There
follow. suggestions in cable traffic on what approach QJ) WIN should use
ra recruit him. However, a special channel FI/D cable of 14 December
rates this target as marginal when considered against the framework of
plans for QUWIN and instructs him to desist if action has not already
been taken. The first paragraph of this cable states that we ''would
‘Like restrict QIWIN to activity directly pertinent his mission
-Leopoldville or forthcoming mission Dakar and possibly elsewhere
(e. g.,° Milan) for FI/D purposes. He our only asset of this type and
” we wish keep him clean of any operational avulveueee other than that

originally planned for him." This cable would tend to rule out

involvement in an assassination plot, since it is highly unlikely that

would be burdened with other chores or assignments immediately

Lumumba was still alive, albeit under arrest, as of the middle ~

of January 1961, and it seems clear that QJWIN had left the Congo

in December 1960. A 19 December cable to Leopoldville aes

his return to Luxembourg on 21 December and instructs Luxembourg

‘to pay him 1000 dollars for December salary, which is the final

payment for his services on this operation. Also, headquarters was
working out the details of a Congo assignment. An 11 January 1961
headquarters memorandum, which refers to T/A's dated 21 December
1960, states that the referenced amounts were given to QUWIN by the
Chief of Station, Luxembourg. This suggests that QUWIN was in.
Luxembourg on or before 21 December.
Subsequently, it appears that QUJWIN operated in Europe trying
to spot and assess individuals whom the Agency could use in safe-

cracking operations, in line with one of the principal missions of

FI/D. A24 May 1962 cable to Luxembourg mentions that a decision

was made to keep him in Europe and that the Leopoldville assignment
had been cancelled. A transfer to Baden-Baden is deemed a good

choice. Also, a 24 April 1964 disptach from Luxembourg, which

mentions the termination of QUWIN's contfact, refers to the fact

that his only assignment since January 1962 has been to establish
cover.

Agency officers who were handling ‘Qu WIN in Europe were almost
certainly unaware of the fact that he was being considered as an asset
by the senior Agency official who had begun to become active in E
February 1962 in the assassination plot against Castro. An undated
(EYES ONLY) memorandum from the Deputy Director (Plans) refers
to a 19 February. 1962 memorandum and authorizes the retention of
the services of QIWIN in activities which we have identified as
coincidential with the assassination plot against Castro. The date of |
the reference memorandum coincides with the time that the senior
Agency official became actively involved in this enterprise. A
Porat of 27 June 1963 dealing with the further handling of
QIWIN mentions that this enterprise has been terminated, except
fae icae precautionary "life line." is

In summary, it is almost certain that QUWIN had nothing at all
to do with the assassination of Lumumba, even though the contents ane
language of available files are often cryptic and imprecise. If he had
been, it is highly unlikely that the number of Agency officers handling

and contemplating assignments for him would have been so large. The

headquarters division for wnat Cal was concerned, inter

alia, with obtaining foreign cipher and cade books, and it is reasonable

to conclude that QUWIN's primary and exclusive responsibility was to

find individuals who could do this kind of job. One of the officers who

first met QJWIN in Luxembourg was on a trip overseas to find safe-

crackers and document-suppliers. The 14 December. 1960 cable

mentions keeping him clean and using him in Dakar and — sibly Milan,

which was specifically mentioned in the 13 October dispatch . pee :

good possibilities for finding safecrackers and document-suppliers.

Further, good tradecraft practices oda dictate that the last thing

that would keep an individual clean would be involvement in an

assassination plot. Although the Chief of FI/D coincidentally was

later assigned responsibility for the Castro operation, there is

no evidence to suggest that he was privy to assassination plots prior

to his briefing in late 1961. i
- While QUJWIN was considered for use in the "executive action

capability", there is no information available to suggest that he had

ever been approached in this regard, much less used in any of the

planning.

iv Sedms clear that the Agency

was in no way involved in'the assassination of Lumumba. However,
in the course of our research, two aspects of the Lumumba story
surfaced that indicate Agency involvement in a plot. In the one
instance, our 1967 source mentioned the name of an Agency officer
‘who was designated as the case officer for an assassination plot
against Lumumba, but reported that he had declined the assignment.
That officer was the originator of a 19 December 1960 cable to
Leopoldville in which he authorized the return of QIWIN to

Luxembourg on 21 December to await further instructions and the

payment of 1000 dollars to him for his December salary by the

Luxembourg Station. The last paragraph of the cable advises
Leopoldville that headquarters is working out the details of a Congo
assignment for QUWIN. The same officer was the originator of a
31 January 1961 memorandum dealing with payments to QIWIN.

In the second instance, a 17 December 1960 cable from
Leopoldville deals with the activities of a ety recruited agent,

WIROGUE, whose mission was to try to spot persons for a”

surveillance team, intelligence assets (with emphasis on Orientale

Province), and paramilitary assets. The second paragraph of the

cable mentions that he resided in the same hotel as QUWIN (although

neither knew of the others CIA connection) and that he approached

the latter on 14 December with an offer &f 300 dollars per month to
participate in an intelligence net and to be a member of an "execution
squad."" When QIWIN said that he was not interested, WIROGUE
added that there would be bonuses for special jobs. The cable -
mentioned in paragraph 6 that the Station was concerned with the free
wheeling of WIROGUE, his lack of security, his inability to handle
finances, and his unwillingness to follow instructions. The Station
was willing to keep him on probation, but believed his recall would
be the best solution. A suggested alternative — to put him in
Stanleyville to try to obtain immediate intelligence on that area.

In an attempt to reconstruct events, ‘Africa Division was apprised
of the above and was asked to search its records in an attempt to
clarify what WIROGUE was up to in the Congo and his reference to an
“execution squad."' The research did not clarify the matter to any
great extent, although some assumptions can be made on the basis of
circumstantial evidence. On 19 September 1960, two members of
Africa Division met with WIROGUE to discuss an operational assign-
ment in that division. ‘In connection with the assignment, he was to
be trained in demolitions, small arms, and medical immunization.
In October 1960, a cable to Leopoldville stated that he was being

prepared for a deep cover assignment to arrive Leopoldville late

surveillance team, intelligence assets and paramilitary assets.

Shortly after arrival, WIROGUE ran into QJWIN, who later told the

i
station that WIROGUE looked like an intelligence agent. In attempting
to recruit QUWIN for his “execution squad", WIROGUE exceeded his

instructions to avoid making approaches without checking with a

Leopoldville Station.

“WIROGUE was given permission to take flying lessons. By March,

Africa Division believes that WIROGUE was recruited for his

in order to establish a support mechanism in Leopoldville. At the
time the Congo was in chaos, we had few assets there, and the
likelihood existed that the political situation would degenerate .
quickly. .The Station possibly also wanted to have a latent paramilitary
capability. An October 1964 assessment of WIROGUE indicates little

most of his time trying to develop contacts and was not directly involved

in any particular operation.
