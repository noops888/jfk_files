To clarify any discrepancies, agency had Hunter Leake

Said Shaw was official source contacted on 30 occaisions ‘
between 1949 and 1956. Did see Shaw socially on chance occasions
in the downtown New Orelans area during which tme thre was little
Conversation other than "how are you,"etc. Did not see Shaw at al
enssaet after 1965, presumably because Shaw had retired from Trade Mart

and may not have been frequenting downtown restaurants.

CIA tried to determine relationship between Shaw and Permindex or
