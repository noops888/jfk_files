Mr. Rocca, as the day to day CIA working level

contact with the Warren Commission stated that on the

average it took less than one week for the CIA to transmit

its information to the Warren Commission, after such in-

formation had been processed by the Agency. (Rocca dep.,

pp.66-67) (Add the opinion of WC staffers.)

However,

fondern fort protecting it s

Each of these concerns will be examined

herein.

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations, as outlined above, was

evident from the

Iception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

to reveal all our technical operations." (Scelso dep.

p. 158) Scelso further testified:

We were going to give them intelligence re-

ports which derived from all our

sources, in-

cluding technical sources, including the

tele-

phone intercept and the information gotten

from the interrogation of Silvia Duran, for

example, which corresponded almost exactly

with the information from the telephone inter-

cepts. (Ext to Scelso quote, all of p.5)

Mr. Scelso's characterization is supported by

examination of the background to the first major CIA

report furnished the Warren Commission regarding Lee Harvey

31 danmeno

Oswald's trip to Mexico City. (Cite.) Much of the informa-

tion provided to the Warren Commission in this report was

based upon sensitive sources and methods, identification

of which had been deleted completely from the report.

The CLA

policy i

limiting Warren Commission know-

ledge of CIA sources and methods was articulated as early

as December 20, 1963, at which time a cable was sent from

CIA headquarters to the Mexico City Station which stated:

Our present plan in passing information to the

Warren Commission is to eliminate mention of tele-

The basic policy articulated in the December 20,

1963 cable is also set forth in a CIA memorandum of

December 17, 1963. In that memorandum, Birch O'Neal

Special Investigations Grasp-

of the CIA Counterintelligence Staff wrote that he had

been advised by Sam Papich, FBI liaison me to the CIA,

that the FBI was anticipating a request from the Warren

Commission for copies of the FBI's materials which sup-

ported or complimented the FBI's five volume report of

Decmeber 9, 1963 submitted to the Warren Commission.

Papich provided O'Neal with this report which indicated

that some United States Agency was tapping telephones

in Mexico. Papich queried O'Neal whether the FBI could

taps. (The FBI had knowledge of CIA's telephone surveil-

lance operations in Mexico City, see CIA SaCI-3/779/510)

O'Neal's memorandum

that he discussed this matter

with Scelso who in turn, after a discussion with Helms,

was directed by Helms to prepare CIA material to be passed

mission at least in this manner--via the FBI-

IV. Telephone Taps and Photo Surveillance

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to

inform the Warren Commission, at least during

oftle@ommission'sussik,

the initial stage of the CIA's telephonic and photo sur-

veillance operations in Mexico City

Helms testified:

The reason for the sensitivity of these tele-

phone taps

and surveillance was not only be-

cause it was sensitive from the Agency's

standpoint, but the telephone taps were run-

ning in conjunction with the Mexican authori-

ties and therefore, if this had become public

knowledge, it would have caused very bad feel-

ings between Mexico and the United States,

and that was the reason. (Helms Exec Session

hearing, pp.51-52,

On February l, 1964 Helms appeared before the

Commission (see above) and likely discussed the memoran-

dum of January i , 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee

Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of

January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

as of his writing.

*, the Warren Commission

had no substantive knowledge of the telephone surveillance

operation or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-

cripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-

ruary 10, 1964 letter whether Oswald's direct communica-

tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in

of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated

by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-

mission had been informed of the telephone surveillance

operation and its success in tapping Oswald this inquiry

by Rankin would not have been made.

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this

conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between

the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-

mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headquar-

ters in Langley, Virginia and had been shown various trans-

cripts resulting from the CIA's telephond surveillance

operations in Mexico City. (Rocca dep. P.89) However,

Mr. Rocca did not personally make this material available

to Commission representatives and was not able to state

under oath precisely the point in time at which the Warren

Commission learned of these operations.

---

## Page 10

- 25

On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to Rankin's

inquiry of February 10.

The Agency response did indi-

cate that Oswald had phoned the Soviet Consulate and was

also interviewed at the Consulate. However, the Agency did

not reveal the source of this information in its response

to the connissionto indicate that it would be revealed

by other means (e.g. by oral briefing).

v.

During the period of March - April 1964, David

Slawson drafted a series of memoranda which among other

issues concerned Warren Commission knowledge of and access

to the production material derived from the CIA telephonde

surveillance operations in Mexico City. A review of

these memoranda tend to support the Committee's belief

that the Warren Commission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman,

and Willens did not obtain access to CIA telephone surveil-

lance materials until April 9, 1964. At that time, Coleman,

Salwson and Willens met with Win Scott, the CIA's Chief

Scott

of Station in Mexico City. i provided them with various

transcripts and translations derived from CIA telephone

taps of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy/Consulates. (Slawson

1964, the record indicates that the Warren Commission

had at least become aware that the CIA did maintain

telephone surveillance of

the Cuban Embassy/Consulate.

(Slawson memorandum, March 12, 1964, Subj: meeting with

CIA representatives). Slawson's memoranâum reveals

the Warren Commission had learned that CIA nu

Helms responded to the Com-

mission's request for access,

a that he would

attempt to arrange for the Warren Commission representatives'

to review

this material. (Slawson memo, March 12, 1964)

It shouldbe noted that the records reviewed do not

reveal the manner in which the Commission learned of the

Dorticos-Armas

intercepts.". As detailed above, both the FBI

and White House (through McGeorge Bundy) were aware of the

CIA's telephonic surveillance activities in Mexico City.

(cite

One or the other could well have provided the war-

ren Commission with this information. Nevertheless, Ray-

mond Rocas' testimony as cited herein (Rocca dep.

lends some support to the position that the Commission had

been informed of the Dorticos-Armas conversations through

the CIA's initiative.

## Page 12

- 27 -

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions Concerns. Oswald's

Mexico trip,

that he had reached

were derived from CIA

memorandad of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

and in addition a Mexican federal police summary of

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. SIlVIa

Duran,

(sic) an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-.

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that salson placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that Salwson had been provided the Duran

telephonk intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments conerning the Mejlean police report,

it would appear that the Warren Commission as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

Insert pa8

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

given access

to the Duran transcripts is further supported

by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)

wherein

he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

the Commission had been

forced to rely upon the two memoranda that did not make

over three months in not exposing the surveillance opera-

tions to the review of the concerned Warren Commission

staff members. As was stated in the CIA cable of Decem

ber 20, 1964 to its Mexico City Station:

Our present plan in passing information to

that an American was presently at the Cuban Embassy, re-

at its

nception but as. the record indicates they were

not then made available.

The record supports the Committee's finding that

as of April 2, 1964 the Warren Commission

had still not

been given access to the above-referenced

series of tele-

phonde intercepts. In a memorandum of that date by Coleman

and Slawson, they articulatedone question to the CIA and

Upon the group's

arrival in Mexico City, they were met

by U.S. Ambassador Freeman, Claire Boonstra of the State

Department, Clarke Anderson of the FBI, and Winston Scott of

the CIA.

That same day during a meeting between the Commission

representatives and Win Scott, Scott made available to the

group actual transcripts of the telephond surveillance

operations and English translations of the same. In addition,

he provided the group with reels of photographs for the

time period covered by Oswald's visit that had resulted from

photosurveillance of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy entrances

David Slawson wrote:

"...Mr. Scott stated at the beginning of his narrative

that he intended to make a complete disclosure of all

facts, including the sources of his information, and

that he understood that all three of us had been cleared

for TOP SECRET and that we would not disclose beyond

the confines of the Commission and its immediate staff

the information we obtained through him without first

clearing it with his superiors in Washington.

We

agreed to this." (Slawson memo, April 22, 1964, p. 22)

Mr. Scott described to the Commission representatives

the CIA's course of action immediately following the assassination.

CIA material forwarded to the Secret Service since November 23,

1964. Rocca then stated:

"Unless you feel otherwise, Jim would prefer

VIII.

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's

assassination, a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named

"Luisa" received a telephone call from an unidentified man

speaking Spanish. (MEXI 7105, 27 Nov. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-

ment) This call had been intercepted and recorded by the CIA's

Mexico City Station as the result of its LIENVOY (tel. tap)

operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the

Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then

employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban

Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified

caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa

replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The callerwent on to tell Luisa that the person

apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of

the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that

she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being

held for the killing was a gringo. The unidentified caller

replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned

nothing else about the assassination that she had learned

about the assassination only a little while ago. The

unidentified caller commented:

---

## Page 21

We think that if it had been or had

segregationists or against intergration

who had killed Kennedy, then there was,

let's say, the possibility that a sort

of civil war would arise in the United

States; that contradictions would be

sharpened.. who knows

Luisa responded:

Imagine, one, two, three and now, that makes

are in response to

a 1975 Rockefeller Commission request for information on

a possible Cuban conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy wrote regarding Calderon's comments:

Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto

suggestion of foreknowledge. This is the

only item in the intercept coverage of the

Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknow-

ledge or expectation. (Rocca memo for DC/OPS,

23 May 1975, p. 15)

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic com-

ments do not merit serious attention. Her words may in-

deed indicate foreknowledge.of the assassination but may

also--

y be interpreted without such

a sinister impli-

cation. Nevertheless, as will be discussed herein, the

Committee has determined that Luisa Calderon's case did

merit serious attention in the months following the assas-

sination.

However, Calderon's comments were not reported

to the Warren Commission, apparently an agency oversight.

Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying

Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed

to be 1940 (Dispatch, HMMA21612) Calderon's presènce in

Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). That dis-

patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data

on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico

was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's Commercial

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned about

17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to

Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico.

The information to which

I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange

that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from

the DGI althought she apparently did not do any

work for the Service. (The case officer) told

me that hers was a peculiar case and that he

himself believed that she had been recruited in

Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-

though Manuel Pineiro,

the Head of the DGI, did

not agree.

As I recall, (the case officer) had

investigated Luisa Calderon.

This was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had

intercepted a letter to her by an American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar.

As you know,

Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so

ames is die

the pronunciation of

I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-

dez should be spelled. It could have been "Howard"

or something different. As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love letter

but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and

Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the

case officer) that after the interception of

the letter she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

I do not know if this

could have been Oswäld...

(11 May 64, Rocca memo, FOIA687-295 with/4 attachments).

On May 15, 1964, Helms wrote Rankin regarding

AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its sensi-

tivity and operational significance. Attached to Helms'

communication was

a paraphrased accounting of sansasch's

May 5 memorandum. (Helm's memo, May 15, 1964, FOIA 697-294) .

In that attachment the intelligence associations of

Manuel Vega Perez and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez are set

forth. However, that attachment fakes no reference what-

soever to Luisa Calderon.

ARSMUG/ I

As cited with regard to Luisa Calderon, a defec-

tor from the Cuban Intelligence Services provided the

CIA with significant information about Lee Harvey Oswald's

contacts with the DGI in Mexico City. This defector

was assigned the CIA cryptonym AMMUG-1 (A-1 hereinafter).*

CIA files reveal that A-l defected from the DGI

on April 21, 1964 in

When

he defected, A-l possessed a number of DGI documents which

were subsequently turned over to the CIA.

IN 68894,

Joseph H. Langosch, went to

to meet A-1, debrief

him, and arrange for A-l's travel into the United States.

(See supra cite.) On May 1, 1964, 22 reels of Langresh's

debriefing of A-l were forwarded to the Chief of the CIA's

Special Affairs Staff from the Chief of Station in

Effective on May 1, A-l was under contract with

the CIA for operational purposes. (Contract Approving Of-

ficer memo, 6 May 64) By June 23, 1964, Langosch was

convinced that A-l would be of great value to the Agency.

He stated:

There is no question in my mind that, AMMUG-1

*It is now known that A-l aid provide significant leads to

the CIA regarding

Luisa Calderon.

It is further apparent

that little of this information was made available by the

CIA to the Warren Commission.

Therefore, the possibility

exists that A-l had provided other information to the CIA

that was relevant to the Warren Commission's work but that which

was not properly reported to the Commission.

A-1 knew who were the Cuban Intelligence officers

assigned to Mexico City. In this regard he intially

identified Alfredo MirabaI, Manuel Mega and Rogelia rodriquez

and the Commercial attache as DGI officers posted at the

Cuban Embaesy in Mexico City. (supra) Langosch described

A-l's knowledge of DGI operations in Mexico as follows:

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations, as outlined above, was

evident from the

ception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

to reveal all our technical operations." (Scelso dep.

p.158) Scelso further testified:

We were going to give them intelligence re-

ports which derived from all our sources, in-

x°

cluding technical sources, including the tele-

whet

phone intercept and the information gotten

from the interrogation of Silvia Duran, for

example, which corresponded almost exactly

with the information from the telephone inter-

cepts. (Ext to Scelso quote, all of p.5)

Mr. Scelso's characterization is supported by

examination of the background to the first major CIA

report furnished the warren commanmen agarding Lee Harvey

Oswald's trip to Mexico City. (Cite.) Much of the informa-

tion provided to the Warren Commission in this report was

based upon sensitive sources and methods, identification

of which had. been deleted completely from the report.

The

policy

limiting Warren Commission know-

ledge of CIA sources and methods was articulated as early

as December 20, 1963, at which time a cable was sent from

CIA headquarters to the Mexico City Station which stated:

standpoint, but the telephone taps were run-

On February 1, 1964, Helms appeared before the

Commission (see above) and likely discussed the memoran-

dum of January 3/ , 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee

Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of

January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

look as of his wautirs.., the Warren Commission

had no substantive knowledge of the telephone surveillance

operation or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-

cripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-

ruary 10, 1964 letter whether Oswald's direct communica-

tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in

. of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated

by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-

mission had been informed of the telephong surveillance

operation and its success in tapping Oswald this inquiry

by Rankin would not have been made. Good priet.

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this

conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between

the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-

mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headquar-

ters in Langley; Virginia and had been shown various trans-

cripts resulting from the CIA's telephond surveillance

operations in Mexico City. (Rocca dep. p.89) However,

Mr. Rocca did not personally make this material available

to Commission representatives and was not able to state

under oath precisely the point in time at which the Warren

firsts

Commission learned of these operations.

On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to Rankin's

inquiry of February 10. The Agency response did indi-

cate that Oswald had phoned the Soviet Consulate and was

also interviewed at the Consulate. However, the Agency did

not revealthe source of this information in its response

to the commissionnor indicate that it would be revealed

by other means (e.g. by oral briefing).

During the period of March - April 1964, David

It shouldbe noted that the records reviewed do not

reveal the manner in which the Commission learned of the

Dorticos-Armas intercepts. As detailed above, both the FBI

and White House (through McGeorge Bundy) were aware of the

CIA's telephonic surveillance activities in Mexico City.

One or the other could well have provided the war-

ren Commission with this information. Nevertheless, Ray-

mond Rocas' testimony as cited herein (Rocca dep.

lends some support to the position that the Commission had

been informed of the Dorticos-Armas conversations through

the CIA's initiative.

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions cancerous

- Oswald's

Mexico trip,

that he had reached

were derived from CIA

memorandas of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

and in addition a Mexican federal police summary manof

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, (sic) an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that salvson placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that Salwson had been provided the Duran

telephonk intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments conerning the Meircan police report,

It would appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

Insert pa8

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported

by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)

wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

he gite we based upon an analysis of sylvia Duran's testi-

mony before the Mexican police.

Upon the group's arrival in Mexico City, they were met

by U.S. Ambassador Freeman, Claire Boonstra of the State

"Scott's narrative plus the material we were shown dis-

information had been in Oswald's contacts with the

been subjected had entered some place in Washington,

because the CIA information that we were shown by Scott

was unambiguous on almost all the crucial points. We

had previously planned to show Scott, Slawson's

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's.

assassination, a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named

"Luisa" received a telephone call from an unidentified man

speaking Spanish. (MEXI 7105, 27 Nov. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-

ment) This call had been intercepted and recorded by the CIA's

Mexico City Station as the result of its LIENVOY (tel. tap)

operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the

Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then

employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban

Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified

caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa

replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The callerwent on to tell Luisa that the person

apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of

the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that

she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being

held for the killing was a gringo. The unidentified caller

replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned

nothing else about the assassination; that she had learned

about the assassination only a little while ago. The

unidentified caller commented:

Luisa responded:

Raymond Rocca, fo

in response to

a 1975

Rockefeller Commission request for information on

a possible Cuban conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy wrote regarding Calderon's comments:

Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto

suggestion of foreknowledge. This is the

only item in the intercept coverage of the

Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the

suggestion of foreknow

ledge or expectation. (Rocca memo for DC/OPS,

23 May 1975, p. 15)

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic com-

ments do not merit serious attention. Her words may in-

deed indicate foreknowledge of the assassination but may

also-=

y be interpreted without such

a sinister impli-

cation.

Nevertheless, as will be discussed herein, the

Committee has determined that Luisa Calderon's case did

merit serious attention in the months following the assas-

sination. However, Calderon's comments were not reported

to the Warren Commission, apparently an agency oversight.

---

## Page 55

- 47 -

Calderon's 201 file reveals that she arrived in

Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying

Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed

to be 1940 (Dispatch, HMMA21612) Calderon's presence in

Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,

1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to

the CIA's Mexico City séôtion and to the Chief of the CIA's

Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). That dis-

patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data

on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico

City. At page three of the attached report Luisa Calderon

was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's commercial

office. The notation indicated that a report was pending

on Calderon. The Agency has attempted, without success,

to locate the report.

On September I, 1963, a dispatch was sent from

the Chief of the Special Affairs Staff to the Chief of

indent

the Station in Mexico City (Dispatch HMMW 11935) .

Luisa Calderon's association with the Cuban DGI

was first reported by the CIA on May 5, 1964. At that

time, Harold Swenson, Chief of Counterintelligence for the

Special Affairs Staff, recorded the results of his de-

briefing of the Cuban defector, AMMUG-1. The memorandum

states that AMMUG had no direct knowledge of lee Harvey

Oswald or his activities but was able to provide items

of interest based upon the comments of certain Cuban In-

I This dispater reported that:

telligence Service officers. Specifically, AMMUG-1 had

been

asked if Oswald was known to the Cuban

intelligence

services before November 23, 1963. AMMUG-1 told Swenson,

as recorded in the May 5 memorandum that "prior to October

1963, Oswald visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City on

two or three occasions. Before, during and after these

visits, Oswald was in contact with the Direccion General

De Intelligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa Calderon,

Manuel Vega Perez, and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez.

Swenson thereafter wrote that Calderon's precise

relationship to the DGI was not clear. As a comment to

this statement he set forth the CIA cable and dispatch

traffic which recorded her arrival in Mexico and departure, during.

perfrier 1164

for Cuba.

On May 7, 1964, Swenson recorded additional informa-

tion he had elicited from AMMUG-1 regarding Oswald's

possible contact with the GI. Paragraph 3 of this memoran-

dum stated in part:

"a. Luisa Calderon, since she returned to

Cuba, has been paid a regular salary

by the DGI even though she has not per-

formed any services.

Her home is in

the Vedado section where the rents are

high.

b. Source (AMMUG) has known Calderon for

several years. Before going to Mexico,

she worked in the Ministry of Exterior

Commerce in the department which was

known as the "Empress Transimport."

Her title was Secretary General of the

Communist Youth in the department named

in the previous sentence.

---

## Page 57

- 49 -

• On May 8 Swenson further disclosed AMMUG's know

ledge of the Oswald case. Swenson paraphrased AMMUG'S

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because. I learned about

17 March 1964, shortly before I made a trip to

Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico. The information to which

I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented to (him)

that it seemed strange

that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from

the DGI althought she apparently did not do any

work for the Service.

(The case officer) told

me that hers was a peculiar case and that he

himself believed that she had been recruited in

Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-

though Manuel Pineiro,

the Head of the DGI, did

not agree.

As I recall, (the case officer) had

investigated Luisa Calderon.

This was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had

intercepted a letter to her by an

American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar.

As you know,

the pronunciation of

Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so

I am not sure of how

the name mentioned by Hernan-

dez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard"

or something different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love letter

but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and

I also understand

from (the

case officer) that after the interception of

the letter she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

I do not know if this

could have been Oswald...

On May •1l, Raymond Rocca wrote a memorandum

to Director Richard Helms regarding the information Swenson

had elicited from AMMUG.

Rocca proposed that "the DDP

in person or via a designee, preferably the former, dis-

cuss the AMMUG/1 sitaution on a very restricted basis

with Mr. Rankin at his earliest convenience either at

the Agency or at the Commission headquarters. Until this

takes place, it is not desirable to put anything in writ-

ing. (11 May 64, Rocca memo, FOIA687-295 with/4 attachments).

On May 15, 1964, Helms wrote Rankin regarding

AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its sensi-

tivity and operational significance. Attached to Helms'

communication was a paraphrased accounting of Swenson's

May 5 memorandum. (Helm's memo, May 15, 1964, FOIA 697-294) .

The CIA's concern

for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations,

as outlined above, was

evident from the r

minception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first

to reveal all our technical operations." (seest et"

But

p.158)

did

Scelso further testifiga. that :

We were going to give them intelligence re-

ports which derived from all our sources, in-

cluding technical sources, including the tele-

phone intercept and the information gotten

from the interrogation of Silvia Duran, for

example, which corresponded almost exactly

with the information from the telephone inter-

cepts. (Ext to seelse quote, all of p-5)

Ibia

Mr. Scelso's characterization is supported by

examination of the background to the first major CIA

report furnished the Warren Commission regarding Lee Harvey

swald's trip to Mexico City

tion provided to the Warren Commission in this report was

based upon sensitive sources and methods, identification

of which had been deleted completely from the report.

The

policy

limiting Warren Commission know

ledge of CIA sources and methods was articulated as early

as December 20, 1963, at which time a cable was sent from

CIA headquarters to the Mexico City Station which stated:

Our present plan in passing information to the

Warren Commission is to eliminate mention of tele-

IV. Telephone Taps and Photo Surveillance

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to inform the Warren Commission, at least during

the initial stage of the CIA's telephonic and photo sur-

veillance operations in Mexico City,

Helms--testified:

The reason for the sensitivity of these tele-

phone taps and surveillance was not only be-

cause it was sensitive from the Agency's

standpoint, but the telephone taps were run-

ning in conjunction with the Mexican authori-&Y

tiesland therefore, if this had become public

knowledge, it would have caused very bad feel-

and that was the reason.

by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-

During the period of March - April 1964, David

1964, the record indicates that the Warren Commission

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions!

were derived from CIA

memorandas of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964, Slawsrândum

March 220964,

and in addition a Mexican federal police summary tof pro

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination

with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, (sic) an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police. LIbial

These comments indicate that Salwson placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that Salwson had been provided the Duran

telephonk intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of

Slawson's comments conerning the Mejican police report,

it would appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information pertaining

to Sylvia Duran.

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported

your determination. " Rocca outlined Angleton's desire not to

respond directly to Rankin's request of February 12 regarding

CIA material forwarded to the Secret Service since November 23,

1964.

Rocca then stated:

"Unless you feel otherwise, Jim would prefer

to wait out the Commission

on the matter covered by

paragraph 2 (of the above-referenced February 12

letter).

If they come back on this point he feels

Do c

that you, or someone from here, should be prepared to

90 over to show the Commission the material rather than

pass them to them in copy. Incidentally, none of these

items are of new substantive interest.

We have either

passed the material in substance to the Commission in

response to earlier levies on the items another items

photographs which are not of Oswald...

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned about

17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to

Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico.

The information to which

I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange

that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from

the DGI althought she apparently did

work for the Service. (The case officer) told

me that hers was a peculiar case and that he

himself believed that she had been recruited

in

Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-

though Manuel Pineiro,

the Head of the DGI, did

not agree.

As I recall, (the case officer) had

investigated Luisa Calderon.

This was because,

during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had

intercepted a letter to her by an American who

signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something

As you know, the pronunciation of

Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so

I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-

dez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard"

or something different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love letter

but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and

Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the

case officer) that after the interception of

the letter she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

I do not know if this

could have been Oswald... Isid

On May 11, Raymond Rocca wrote a memorandum

to Director Richard Helms regarding the information Swenson
