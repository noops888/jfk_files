Mr. Rocca, as the day to day CIA working level

rounding™photograph now referred to as that
of the "Mexico City Mystery Man"
Each of these concerns will be examined Syyaaueemed
rcrein.

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence of

sensitive technical operations, as outlined above, was

evident from the gdp eption of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that "we were not authorized at first
to reveal all our technical operations." (Scelso dep.
p-158) Scelso further testified:

We were going to give them intelligence re-

ports which derived from all our sources, in-

cluding technical sources, including the tele-

phone intercept and the information gotten

from the interrogation of Silvia Duran, for

example, which corresponded almost exactly

with the information from the telephone inter-

cepts. (Ext to Scelso quote, all of p.5)

Mr. Scelso's characterization is supported by
examination of the background to the first major CIA
report furnished the Warren Commission a emer Lee Harvey

ZtTanmene
Oswald's trip to Mexico City.‘(Cite.) Much of the informa-
tion provided to the Warren Commission in this report was
based upon sensitive sources and methods, identification
of which had been deleted completely from the report.
A

one boiicy Seager limiting Warren Commission know-
ledge of CIA sources and methods was articulated as early
as December 20, 1963, at which time a cable was sent from
CIA headquarters to the Mexico City Station which stated:

Our present plan in passing information to the
Warren Commission is to eliminate mention of tele-



pastes ie }ete)

phone taps, in order to protect your contin-
uing 6pS . Will rely instead on statements
of Silvia Duran and on contents of Soviet
Consular file which Soviets gave ODACID

(CIA cable DIR 97829 FOLA 498-204, 29Jan1964)

The basic policy articulated in the December 20,
1963 cable is also set forth in a CIA memorandum of
December 17, 1963. In that memorandum, Birch O'Neal

Special Lrvestigad lors Group™

of the CIA Counterintelligence/S§taff wrote that he had
been advised by Sam Papich, FBI liaison men to the CIA,
that the FBI was anticipating a request from the Warren
Commission for copies of the FBI's materials which sup-
ported or complimented the FBI's five volume report of
Decmeber 9, 1963 submitted to the Warren Commission.
Papich provided O'Neal with this report which indicated
that some United States Agency was tapping telephones
in Mexico. Papich queried O'Neal whether the FBI could
supply the Warren Commission seer one of the telephone
taps. (The FBI had knowledge of CIA's telephone surveil-
lance operations in Mexico City, see CIA S@1-3/779/510)
O'Neal's memorandum eameNA that he discussed this matter
with Scelso who in turn, after a discussion with Helms,
was directed by Helms to prepare CIA material to be passed
.to the Warren Commission. O'Neal wrote:

He (Scelso) was quite sure it was not the

Agency's desire to make available to the Com—

mission at least in this manner--via the FBI-

sensitive information which could relate to

telephone taps (Birch O'Neal, Memo for File,

Iv. Telephone Taps and Photo Surveillance

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to inform the Warren Commission, at least during
fhe oP SS pen’ $:
the initial stage of the CIA's telephonic and photo sur-

veillance operations in Mexico city, ‘es
ee §=Helms testified:

The reason for the sensitivity of these tele-
phone taps and surveillance was not only be-
cause it was sensitive from the Agency's
standpoint, but the telephone taps were run- Pal
ning in conjunction with the [Mexican authori-‘
ties] and therefore, if this had become public
knowledge, it would have caused very bad feel-
a ings between Mexico and the United States,
oon and that was the reason. (Helms Exec Session

On February 1, 1964 Helms appeared before the
Commission (see above) and likely discussed the memoran-
dum of January 3/ , 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee
Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of
January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

Ais weiting
Gielen: as Of thummisummmiewe, the Warren Commission

had no substantive knowledge of the telephoné¢surveillance
operation or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-

cripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-
ruary 10, 1964 [etter whether Oswald's direct communica-

tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in

d

uw. of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated
by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-
mission had been informed of the telephong surveillance
operation and its success in tapping Oswald this inquiry
by Rankin would not have been made.

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this
conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between
the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-
mission's representatives had visited the CIA's headquar-
ters in Langley, Virginia and had been shown various trans~
cripts resulting from the CIA's telephoné surveillance
operations in Mexico City. (Rocca dep. p.89) However,
Mr. Rocca did not personally make this material available
to Commission representatives and was not able to state

under oath precisely the point in time at which the Warren

Commission learned of these operations.


eeu

On February 19, 1964 the CIA responded to Rankin's
inquiry of February 10. The Agency response did indi-
cate that Oswald had phoned the Soviet Consulate and was
also interviewed at the Consulate. However, the Agency did
not reveal the source of this information in its response
to the Commissiowgpr indicate that it would be revealed

by other means (e.g. by oral briefing).

During the period of March ~- April 1964, David
Slawson drafted a series of memoranda which among other
issues concerned Warren Commission knowledge of and access
to the production material derived from the CIA telephonge
surveillance operations in Mexico City. A review of
these memoranda ten@to support the Committee's belief
that ‘the Warren Commission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman,
and Willems did not obtain access to CIA telephone surveil-
lance materials until April 9, 1964. At that time, Coleman,
Fruson and Willens met with Win Scott, the CIA's Chief
of Station in Mexico city Bat provided them with various
transcripts and translations derived from CIA telephone
taps of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy/Consulates. (Slawson

It shouldbe noted that the records reviewed do not

and White House (through McGeorge Bundy) were aware of the
CIA's telephonic surveillance activities in Mexico City.
(CPE 8 one or the other could well have provided the War-
ren Commission with this information. Nevertheless, Ray-
mond Rogas' testimony as cited herein (Rocca dep. )
lends some support to the position that the Commission had
been informed of the Dorticos-Armas conversations through

the CIA's initiative.


eh es

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Siawson therein stated
CPHRLEINIG

that the tentative conclusions

that he had reacheg

memoranda@ of January 31, 1964 and February 19, 1964,

Oswald's

Mexico trip, were derived from CIA
and yin addition a Mexican federal police summary @ggprof
interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination
with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:
A large part of it (the summary report) is
simply a summation of what the Mexican police
learned_when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia
Duran, (sic} an employee of the Cuban Consulate
in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-
rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

These comments indicate that safdison placed limited

reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there

is no indication that saison had been provided the Duran
telephon& intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of
Slawson's comments conerning the Meiftan police report,
it would appear that the Warren Commission,as of March 25

/ 7

had been provided little substantive information pertaining
to Sylvia Duran. 4 Insect pas

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been
given access to the Duran transcripts is further supported
by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)
wherein he states his conclusion that Oswald had visited
the Cuban Embassy on three occasions. This conclusion

lice report. Thus, the Agency had been successful for
over three months in not exposing the surveillance opera-
tions to the review of the concerned Warren Commission
staff members. As was stated in the CIA cable of Decem-
ber 20, 1964 to its Mexico City Station:

Our present plan in”passing information to
the Warren Commission is to eliminate mention
of telephone taps, in order to protect your
continuing operations. Will rely instead

on statements of Silvia Duran and on contents

times. He statedffhat this conclugjep was based upon his

pes

visit tothe c ban-Biibassy* Logically, access to the

telephonic Surveillance production would have clarified some
ambiguities. For example, on September 27, at 4:05 p.m.
Silvia Duran telephoned the Soviet Embassy and stated
that an American was presently at the Cuban Embassy, re-
questing an in-transit visit to Cuba. This American was
determined by CIA analysts to be Oswald. Again on Septem-
ber 28, at 11:51 a.m. Duran telephoned the Soviet Consulate
stating that an American, identified by CIA analysts as
tha cit had tui ce

Oswald @ at the Cuban Embassy. Thus, Ce_RaRRRREEie

definitively established that Oswald had
visited the Cuban Embassy on at least two occasions.
Moreover, the specific dateSand exact timesof his presence
in the Cuban Embassy ab iiened as the result of the
telephonic surveillance. Had this information been made
available to Slawson, his calcuations of Oswald's activities
in Mexico City would have been more firmly established

than- they were as of March 27, 1964. These transcripts


- 30 -

could have been made available to the Warren Commission
at its @dnception but as the record indicates they were
not then made available.

The record supports the Committee's finding that

as of April 2, 1964 the Warren Commission had still not

been given access to the above-referenced series of tele-

phonet intercepts. In a memorandum of that date by Coleman

and Slawson, they articulateone question to the CIA and

two requests for information from the Agency» (Ambassador

Slawsen Cote:

2) We would like to see copies of the transcripts

assassination or related subjects;

3) We would especially like to see the intercept

Lent
The question initially posed in the above-referenced
memorandum of April 2 concerns the CIA telephong intercept
of September 27, 1963 at 10:37 a.m. (Slawson memo, April

On April 3, 1964, Coleman and Slawson articulated
their concern for receiving complete access.to all material®
relevant to Oswald's Mexico City trip. They wrote:

The most probable final result of the entire

investigation of Oswald‘’s activities in Mexico is

a conclusion that he went there for the purpose

of trying to reach Cuba and that no bribes, con-

spiracies, etc. took place.



Upon the group's arrival in Mexico City, they were met
by U.S. Ambassador Freeman, Claire Boonstra of the State
Department, Clarke Anderson of the FBI, and Winston Scott of
the CIA.

That same day during a meeting between the Commission
representatives and Win Scott, Scott made available to the
group actual transcripts of the telephone surveillance
operations and English translations of the same. In addition,
he provided the group with reels of photographs for the
time period covered by Oswald's visit that had resulted from
photosurveillance of the Cuban and Soviet Embassy entrances
David Slawson wrote:

"...Mr. Scott stated at the beginning of his narrative

that he intended to make a complete disclosure of all

facts, including the sources of his information, and
that he understood that all three of us had been cleared
for TOP SECRET and that we would not disclose beyond

the confines of the Commission and its immediate staff

the information we obtained through him without first

clearing it with his superiors in Washington. We
agreed to this." (Slawson memo, April 22, 1964, p. 22)

Mr. Scott described to the Commission representatives

the CIA's course of action immediately following the assassination> ~
immediately :

Scott indicated that his staff eevee! began to compile

dossiers on Oswald, Duran, and everyone else throughout Mexico

whom the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald (p.22).

had photosurveillance because the November photo we had
(of MMM) was not of Oswald. Therefore it did not mean

On March 5, 1967, Raymond Rocca wrote in an internal
memorandum to Richard Helms that "we have a problem here for
your determination." Rocca outlined Angleton's desire not to
respond directly to Rankints request of February 12 regarding
CIA material forwarded to the Secret Service since Novemler 23,
1964. Rocca then stated:

“unless you feel otherwise, Jim would prefer

to wait out the Commission on the matter covered by
paragraph 2 (of the above-referenced February 12
letter). If they come back on this point he feels

that you, or someone from here, should be prepared to
go over to show the Commission the material rather than
pass them to them in copy. Incidentally, none of these
items are of new substantive interest. We have either
passed the material in substance to the Commission in
response to earlier levies on the items on the items
refer to aborted leads, for example, the famous s@x
photographs which are not of Oswald..."

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's
assassination, a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named
"Luisa" received a telephone call from aa unidentified man
speaking Spanish. (MEXI 7105, 27 Nov. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-
ment) This call had been intercepted and recorded by the CIA's
Mexico City Station as the result of its LIENVOY (tel. tap)
operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the
Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then
employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban
Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified
caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa
replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."

The callewent on to tell Luisa that the person
apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the “President of one of
the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that
she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being
held for the killing was a gringo. The unidentified caller
replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned
nothing else about the assassination; that she had learned
about the assassination only a little while ago. The

unidentified caller commented:


- 44 -

We think that if it had been or had
seemed...public or had been one of the
segregationists or against intergration
who had killed Kennedy, then there was
let's say, the possibility that a sort
of civil war would arise in the United
States; that contradictions would be
sharpened...who knows

Luisa responded:

Imagine, ong two, three and now, that makes
.three. (She laughs.)

Raymond Rocca, f OSs SGRimmmamemmnmmaiiticcinsemssamy iS

{ TAT EESESESN in response to

a 1975 Rockefeller Commission request for information on

a possible Cuban conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy wrote regarding Calderon's comments:

Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto

suggestion of foreknowledge. This is the
only item in the intercept coverage of the
Cubans and Soviets after the assassination
that contains the suggestion of foreknow-

ledge or expectation. (Rocca memo for DC/OPS,

23 May 1975, p. 15)

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic

com-

ments do not merit serious attention. Her words may in-

deed indicate foreknowledge of the assassination but may

alsocegmmmieey be interpreted without such a sinister
cation. Nevertheless, as will be discussed herein,
Committee has determined that Luisa Calderon's case

merit serious attention in the months following the

impli-
the
did

assas~

sination. However, Calderon's comments were not reported

to the Warren Commission, apparently an agency oversight.


ace - 47 -

Calderon's 201 file reveals that she arrived in
Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying
Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed
to be 1940 (Dispatch, HMMA21612) Calderon's presence in
Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,
1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to
the CIA's Mexico City Bion and to the Chief of the CIA's
Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). That dis-
patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data
on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City. At page three of the attached report Luisa Calderon
was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's Gommercial
Office. The notation indicated that a report was pending

on Calderon. The Agency has attempted, without success,

to locate the report.

1963, Oswald visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City on
two or three occasions. Before, during and after these
visits, Oswald was in contact with the Direccion General

On May 7, 1964, faa ds recorded additional informa-
tion he had elicited from AMMUG-1 regarding Oswald's
possible contact with the DGI. Paragraph 3 of this memoran-

dum stated in part:
Ee Luisa Calderon,~since she returned to

Cuba, has been paid a regular salary

by the DGI even though she has not per-

formed any services. Her home is in

the Vedado section where the rents are

\ high.

b. Source (AMMUG) has known Calderon for
several years. Before going to Mexico,
she worked in the Ministry of Exterior
Commerce in the department which was
known-as the "Empress Transimport."

Her title was Secretary General of the
Communist Youth in the department named
in the previous sentence.

On May 8 ~Gesmemmame further disclosed AMMUG's know-

Lamsescd
ledge of the Oswald case. =@uummammr paraphrased AMMUG's

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned. about
17 March 1964, shortly before I made a trip to
Mexico, that she had been involved with an
American in Mexico. The information to which
I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...
I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange
that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from
the DGI althought she apparently did not do any
work for the Service. (The case officer) told
me that hers was a peculiar case and that he
himself believed that she had been recruited in
Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-
though Manuel Pineiro, the Head of the DGI, did
not agree. As I recall, (the case officer) had
investigated Luisa Calderon. This was because,
during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had
intercepted a letter to her by an American who
signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation of
Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so
I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-
dez should be spelled. It could have been "Howard"
or something different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love letter
but indicated that there was a clandestine-
professional relationship between the writer and
Luisa Calderon. I also understand from (the
case officer) that after the interception of
the letter she had been followed and seen in the
company of an American. I do not know if this
could have been Oswald...

On May 11, Raymond Rocca wrote a memorandum
to Director Richard Helms regarding the information tango
had elicited from AMMUG. Rocca proposed that "the DDP
in person or via a designee, preferably the former, dis-
cuss the AMMUG/1 sit@ftion on a very restricted basis

with Mr. Rankin at his earliest convenience either at

the Agency or at the Commission headquarters. Until this


takes place, it is not desirable to put anything in writ-
\y
ing. (11 May 64, Rocca memo, FOIA687-295 with/4 attachments).
On May 15, 1964, Helms wrote Rankin regarding
AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its sensi-
tivity and operational significance. Attached to Helms') ,

(HMMW/1935, Sept. 1, 1963)



An earlier CIA dispatch from the CIA Chief of

Station in Mexico City to the Chief of the CIA's Western

Hemisphere Division records that:

Wilfredo of. the Cuban Consulate, Tampico,
reported that Luisa Calderon has a sister
residing in Reynosa, Texas. .-Luisa may go
up to the border to visit her sister soon--
or her mother may make the trip--details
not clear. (HMMA 21849, July 31, 1965

an interest in Calderon's activities and those of her

family. Whether this interest took the form of a clan~-

destine-agent relationship is not revealed by Calderon's

The CIA's concern for revealing the existence -of
sensitive Conca Operations, as outlined above, was
evident from the gbception of the Warren Commission.

Mr. Scelso commented that “we were not authorized at first
to reveal all our technical operations." (Scelso dep.

+ We were going to give them intelligence re-
v ports which derived from all our sources, in-
Ye e cluding technical sources, including the tele-

On February 1, 1964,Helms appeared before the
Commission (see above) and likely discussed the menorene|
dum of January 3/ , 1964. On Feburary 10, 1964, J. Lee
Rankin wrote Helms in regard to the CIA memorandum of
January 31. A review of Rankin's letter indicates that

Ars we hag ae

had no substantive knowledge of the telephoné¢surveillance
operation or the production i.e., the tapes and trans-
ecripts, from that operation. Rankin inquired in the Feb-
ruary 10, 1964 [atter whether Oswald's direct communica-
tion with employees of the Soviet Embassy (as stated in
; of the January 31 memorandum) had been facilitated
by telephone or interview. Manifestly, if the Warren Com-
mission had been informed of the telephonge surveillance
operation and its success in tapping Oswald this inquiry
by Rankin would not have been made. Good ee a

Raymond Rocca's testimony tends to support this
conclusion. It was Rocca's recollection that between
the time period of January 1964 - April 1964, Warren Com-

ters in Langley; Virginia and had been shown various trans-
cripts resulting from the CIA's telephon& surveillance

During the period of March - April 1964, David

and White House (through McGeorge Bundy) were aware of the
CIA's telephonic surveillance activities in Mexico City.

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination
with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is
simply a summation of what the Mexican police
learned nm they interrogated Mrs. Silvia
Duran, (sic} an employee of the Cuban Consulate
in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-
rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police.

| These comments indicate that saflvson placed limited
‘reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there
is no indication that saiflson had been provided the Duran
telephon& intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of
Slawson's comments conerning the Meiftan police report,
it would appear that the Warren Commission,as. of March 25,

The Committee's belief that Slawson had not been

by reference to his memorandum of March 27, 1964 (Cite)

"Scott's narrative plus the material we were shown dis-

information had been in Oswald's contacts with the
Soviet and Mexican Embassies. Apparently the
distortions and omissions to which our information had
been subjected had entered some place in Washington,
because the CIA information that we were shown by Scott
was unambiguous on almost all the crucial points. We
had previously planned to show Scott, Slawson's
reconstruction of Oswald's probable activities at the
embassies to get Scott's opinion, but once we saw how
badly distorted our information was we realized that
this would be useless. Therefore, instead, we decided
to take as close note as possible from the original

VIII. Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President Kennedy's.
assassination, a Cuban government employee in Mexico City named
“Luisa" received a telephone call from an unidentified man
speaking Spanish. © (MEXI 7105, 27 Nov. 63, FOIA 173-615, attach-
ment) This call had been intercepted and recorded by the CIA's
Mexico City Station as the result of its LIENVOY (tel. tap)
operation. (op cit) The Mexico City Station identified the
Luisa of the conversation as Luisa Calderon, who was then
employed in the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban
Consulate.

During the course of the conversation, the unidentified
caller asked Luisa if she had heard the latest news. Luisa

replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kennedy."
The callerwent on to tell Luisa that the person
apprehended for Kennedy's slaying was the "President of one of
; the Committees of the Fair Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that
she knew this also. Luisa inquired whether the person being
held for the killing was a gringo. The unidentified caller
7 | replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller that she had learned
nothing else about the assassination; that she had learned
about the assassination only a little while ago. The

unidentified caller commented:


- 44 -

We think that if it had been or had
seemed...public or had been one of the
segregationists or against intergration
who had killed Kennedy, then there was,
let's’ say, the possibility that a sort
of civil war would arise in the United
States; that contradictions would be
sharpened...who knows

Luisa responded:

Imagine, one two, three and now, that makes
three. (She laughs.)

Raymond Rocca, £CW(I0tUNIimaduuswmmmmanssrasstiititeddrosaes iS
TTT ses Honso to

a 1975 Rockefeller Commission request for information on
a possible Cuban conspiracy to assassinate President
Kennedy wrote regarding Calderon's comments:

Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto

suggestion of foreknowledge. This is the

only item in the intercept coverage of the

Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknow-

ledge or expectation. (Rocca memo for DC/OPS,

23 May 1975, p. 15)

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's eryptic com-
ments do not merit serious attention. Her words may. in-
deed indicate foreknowledge of the assassination but may

’ also-—y be interpreted without such a sinister impli-
cation. Nevertheless, as will be discussed herein, the
Committee has determined that Luisa Calderon's case did
merit serious attention in the months following the assas-

sination. However, Calderon's comments were not reported

to the Warren Commission, apparently an agency oversight.


a

agin
Calderon's 201 file reveals that she arrived in
Mexico City from Havana on January 16, 1964, carrying
Cuban Passport E/63/7. Her date of birth was believed
to be 1940 (Dispatch, HMMA21612) Calderon's presence in
Mexico City was first reported by the CIA on July 15,
1963 in a dispatch from the CIA's Miami field office to
the CIA's Mexico City st3tion and to the Chief of the CIA's
Special Affairs Staff (for Cuban operations). ‘That dis-
patch had attached to it a report containg biographic data
on personnel then assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City. At page three of the attached report Luisa Calderon
was listed as Secretary of the Cuban Embassy's commercial
office. The notation indicated that a report was pending
on Calderon. The Agency has attempted, without success,
to locate the report.
On September 1, 1963, a dispatch was sent from
the Chief of the Special Affairs Staff to the Chief of et
tH Station in Mexico City (Dispatch HMMW 11935) Mas we
Luisa Calderon's association with the Cuban DGI
was first reported by the CIA on May 5, 1964. At that
time, Harold Swenson, Chief of Counterintelligence for the
Special Affairs Staff, recorded the results of his de-
briefing of the Cuban defector, AMMUG-1. The memorandum
states that AMMUG had no direct knowledge of Lee Harvey
Oswald or his activities but was able to provide items

of interest based upon the comments of certain Cuban In-

This AispecteA repor tea Whur:

telligence Service officers. Specifically, AMMUG-1 had
been asked if Oswald was known to the Cuban intelligence
services before November 23, 1963. AMMUG-1 told Swenson,
as recorded in the May 5 memorandum that "Prior to October
1963, Oswald visited the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City on
two or three occasions. Before, during and after these
visits, Oswald was in contact with the Direccion General
De Intelligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa Calderon,
Manuel Vega Perez, and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez.

Swenson thereafter wrote that Calderon's precise
relationship to the DGI was not clear. As a comment to
this statement he set forth the CIA cable and dispatch

traffic which recorded her arrival in Mexico and departure, dung
pec lekr pied
for Cuba.

On May 7, 1964, Swenson recorded additional informa-
tion he had elicited from AMMUG-1 regarding Oswald's
possible contact with the DGI. Paragraph 3 of this memoran-

dum stated in part:

“a. Luisa Calderon, Since she returned to
Cuba, has been paid a regular salary
by the DGI even though she has not per-
formed any services. Her home is in

: the Vedado section where the rents are
high.

b. Source (AMMUG) has known Calderon for
several years. Before going to Mexico,
she worked in the Ministry of Exterior
Commerce in the department which was
known as the "Empress Transimport."

Her title was Secretary General of the
Communist Youth in the department named
in the previous sentence.


ey qt

. On May 8 Swenson further disclosed AMMUG's know-

ledge of the Oswald case. Swenson paraphrased AMMUG's
knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned about
17 March 1964, shortly before I made a trip to
Mexico, that she had been involved with an
American in Mexico. The information to which
I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...
I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange
that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from
the DGI althought she apparently did not do any
work for the Service. (The case officer) told
me that hers was a peculiar case and that he
himself believed that she had been recruited in
Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-
though Manuel Pineiro, the Head of the DGI, did
not agree. As I recall, (the case officer) had
investigated Luisa Calderon. This was because,
during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had
intercepted a letter to her by an American who
signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation of
Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so
I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-
dez should be spelled. It could have been “Howard”
or something different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love letter :
but indicated that there was a clandestine- ee
professional relationship between the writer and
Luisa Calderon. I also understand from (the
case officer) that after the interception of
the letter she had been followed and seen in the
company of an American. I do not know if this
could have been Oswald...

On May 11, Raymond Rocca wrote a memorandum
to Director Richard Helms regarding the information Swenson
had elicited from AMMUG. Rocca proposed that "the DDP
in person or via a designee, preferably the former, dis-
cuss the AMMUG/1 sitaution on a very restricted basis
with Mr. Rankin at his earliest convenience either at

the Agency or at the Commission headquarters. Until this


- 50 -

takes place, it is not desirable to put anything in writ-
ing. (11 May 64, Rocca memo, FOIA687-295 with/4 attachments).
On May 15, 1964, Helms wrote Rankin regarding
AMMUG's information about the DGI, indicating its sensi-

communication was a paraphrased accounting of Swenson's
May 5 memorandum. (Helm's memo, May 15, 1964, FOIA 697-294).
In that attachment the intelligence associations of
Manuel Vega Perez and Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez Are set
forth. However, that attachment RES no reference what-

Howard Willens of the Warren Commission, requested

as a follow-up to the May 15 memorandum, to~teek-at the
questions used in Swenson's interrogation of AMMUG. (Dooley
memo to Rocca, 19 June 1964 FOIA 739-310). On June 18,
1964 Arthur Dooley of Rocca's counterintelligence research
and analysis group took the questions and AMMUG's responses
to the Warren Commission's officers for Willen's review.
Willens saw Swenson's May 5,memorandum. The only mention
of @lderon was as follows: "The precise relationship of
Luisa calderon to the DGI is not clear. She spent about
six months in Mexico from which she returned to Cuba early
in 1964" However, Willens was not shown the Swenson memoran-

During the period of March - April 1964, David

issues concerned Warren Commission knowledge of and access

these memoranda tendto support the Committee! s belief -- +

that the Warren Commission, through Mssrs. Slawson, Coleman,

Another Slawson memorandum, dated March 25, 1964.

concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. Slawson therein stated

that the tentative conclusions Oswald's

Mexico trip, were derived from CIA

Fterh2 51464
and in addition a Mexican federal police summary G&ugrof T7>° )

interrogations conducted shortly after the assassination
with certain Cuban Embassy employees. Slawson wrote:

A large part of it (the summary report) is

simply a summation of what the Mexican police

learned when they interrogated Mrs. Silvia

Duran, (sic} an employee of the Cuban Consulate

in Mexico City, and is therefore only as accu-

rate as Mrs. Duran's testimony to the police. £ TbiaJ

These comments indicate that s@frson placed limited
reliance upon the Mexican police summary. Moreover, there
is no indication that saiflson had been provided the Duran
telephont intercept transcripts. In fact, by virtue of
Slawson's comments conerning the Meiftan police report,
it would appear that the Warren Commission,as. of March 25

+» On May 8 Swenson further disclosed AMMUG's know-
(BP atta.

ledge of the Oswald case. ywemson, paraphrased AMMUG's

knowledge of Calderon as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned about
17 March 1964, shortly before I made a trip to
Mexico, that she had been involved with an
American in Mexico. The information to which
I refer was told to me by a DGI case officer...
I had commented to (him) that it seemed strange
that Luisa Calderon was receiving a salary from
the DGI althought she apparently did not do any
work for the Service. (The case officer) told
me that hers was a peculiar case and that he
himself believed that she had been recruited in
Mexico by the Central Intelligence Agency al-
though Manuel. Pineiro, the Head of the DGI, did
not agree. As I recall, (the case officer) had
investigated Luisa Calderon. This was because,
during the time she was in Mexico, the DGI had
intercepted a letter to her by an American who
signed his name OWER (phonetic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation of
Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so
I am not sure of how the name mentioned by Hernan-
dez should be spelled. It could have been "Howard"
or something different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love letter
but indicated that there was a clandestine-
professional relationship between the writer and
Luisa Calderon. I also understand from (the
case officer) that after the interception of
the letter she had been followed and seen in the
company of an American. [I do « know if this
could have been Oswald. ..[Shia)
