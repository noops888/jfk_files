MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

Subject: Military Personnel Detailed to the

Central Intelligence Agency (C)

1. (C) In response to your request, attached at Tab A is

a summary of the service personnel currently on detail to

the CIA.

The report includes a breakdown by rank and service,

and by country of assignment.

The attached information was

orovided by the Director of Personnel, CIA, because the

personnel systems of the two services

providing the bulk of

the personnel are not programmed to respond promptly to your

request.

2. (S) In the pursuit of the requested information SACSA

learned that the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Systems

Analysis) on 11 August 1966 signed

a letter to the CIA

approving the Agency request for military manpower spaces

for FY 1967. (Total 874, see copy of memorandum at Tab B.)

The entire action on the

Agency manpower request was handled

by ASD/SA with the Services through Secretarial channels.

were neither consulted nor requested to concur in

this major CIA support action. However, it will be noted

that a copy was furnished your office.

3. (S) I believe that lack of involvement of the JCS in

the matter of the annual military manpower authorization.to

CIA is a serious omission.

It stems from an OSD/OSO directive

of 1957 which was pertinent as long as the Erskine-Lansdale

office existed. (Copy attached at Tab C.) When Lansdale's

office was disestablished in 1963 the OSD

directive should have

been rescinded and replaced by an appropriate JCS directive.

With your approval SACSA will initiate the necessary action

with ASD/SA and CIA to insure that future personnel actions

involving CIA are properly actioned within the JCS organization.

These reguirements are approved. In approving this request, it is

suggested that personnel requisitions be submitted sufficientiy in advance

of desired on-station dates to permit selection of individuals with ine re-

quired prerequisites. The Army has stated, for example, that the desirable

lead-time for officers and senior enlisted personnel is 5 to 9 morins, and 5

months for lower grade enlisted men. The Army also states that certain

initial intelligence MOS, particularly for positions requiring Spanish language

fluency, may pose selection problems depending on the time the personnelare

required to be on-station.

It is agreed that reimbursement for personnel so detailed will be made

to the Services by the Central Intelligence Agency in accordance with the

Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the Department of

Defense, approved by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, February 23,

1900.

These requirements

are approved. In approving this request, it is

suggested that personnel requisitions be submitted sufficiently in advance

of desired on-station dates to permit selection of individuals with the re-

quired prerequisites.

The Army has stated, for example, that the desirable

lead-time for officers and senior enlisted personnel is 5 to 9 months, and 5

months foi lower grade enlisted men. The Army also states that certain

iratial intelligence MOS, particularly for positions requiring Spanish language

fluency, may pose selection problems depending on the time the personnelare

required to be on-station.

It is agreed that reimbursement for personnel so detailed will be made

to the Services by the Central Intelligence Agency in accordance with the

Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the Department of

Defease, approved by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, February 23,

1960.
