WASHINGTON, D. C. 20301

18 August 1966

‘THE JOINT STAFF

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

Subject: Military Personnel Detailed to the
Central Intelligence Agency (C)

1. (C) In response to your request, attached at Tab A is
a summary of the service personnel currently on detail to
the CIA. The report includes a breakdown by rank and service,
and by country of assignment. The attached information was
provided by the Director of Personnel, CIA, because the
personnel syStems of the two services providing the bulk of
the personnel are not programmed to respond promptly to your
request.

2. (S) In the pursuit of the requested information SACSA
learned that the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Systems
Analysis) on 11 August 1966 signed a letter to the CTA
approving the Agency request for military manpower spaces
for FY 1967. (Total 874, see copy of memorandum at Tab B.)
The entire action on the Agency manpower request was handled
by ASD/SA with the Services through Secretarial channels.
The JCS were neither consulted nor requested to coneur in
this major CIA support action. However, it will be noted
that a copy was furnished your office.

3. (S) I believe that lack of involvement of the JCS in

the matter of the annual military manpower authorization.to

CIA is a serious omission. It stems from an OSD/OSO directive
of 1957 which was pertinent as long as the Erskine-Lansdale
office existed. (Copy attached at Tab c.) When Lansdale's
office was disestablished in 1963 the OSD’ directive should have
been rescinded and replaced by an appropriate JCS directive.
With your approval SACSA will initiate the necessary action
with ASD/SA and CIA to insure that future personnel actions
involving CIA are properly actioned within the JCS organization.

SYSTEMS ANALYSIS ‘s,

MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

SUBJECT: Central Intelligence Agency Military Personnel Requirements,
FY 1967 (U) .

Reference is made to Central Intelligence Agency memorandum dated
June 7, 1966 to the Department of Defense which states the requirements,
for military personnel to be detailed to the Central Intelligence Agency as

follows: : '
Service : ‘ Officers | "Enlisted -Total
- CsA 34 : 163 ~ 497
: USN 20 15 35
USMC eae 10 . 21
USAF . 180 441 621
TOTAL 245 629 874

These requirements are approved. In approving this request, it is
suggested that personnel requisitions be submitted sufficiently in advance
of desired on-station dates to permit selection of individuals with the re~
quired prerequisites, The Army has stated, for example, that the desirable
lead-time for cificers and senior enlisted personnel is 5 to 9 months, and 5
fox lower grade enlisted men. The Army also states that certain
lL intelligence MOS, particularly for positions requiring Spanish language
fluency, may pose selection problems depending on the time the personnelare

required to be on-station.

i : It is agreed that"reimbursement for personnel so detailed will be made

: to the Services by the Central Intelligence Agency in accordance with the

i Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and the Department of
Defense, approved by the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, February 23,
