MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT:

Ann L. GOODPASTURE

18 October 1970 - 31 October 1971

is retiring very soon.

To the immense regret of this writer Ann Goodpasture

It would

silly to rate

competitively against any of her colleagues, male or female,

vouns or merely well-preserved.

Concerning her fitness be

the ease dished as her detent ones alton meer

I can think of at almost any grade.

I venture to rate her

over-all performance,

thirty years

of it,

as OUTSTANDING.

Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on.

which this organiza

tion is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this

organization will be weakened.

Chief, CI/UPS/rE

EMPLOYEE SIGNATURE:

L. Goodpasture

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently

turns in a Strong performance when she is not doing an out-

standing job. She is an excellent office and project manager

who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor

and briefer.

Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS

and, as Mr.

Johnson has said, in the organization.

I hope

she gets the official Agency

recognition she deserves for

the many years she has made substantive contribution to the

CS.

18 October 1970 - 31 October 1971.

any of her colleagues, male or female,.

Concerning her fitness be

it recorded that she is very fit indeed to porform any of

the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any. others

I can think of at almost any grade.

she retires the fabric of this

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently

turns in a Strong performance when she is not doing an out-

standing job.

She

is an excellent office and project manager

who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor

and briefer.

Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS

and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization.

I hope

she

gets the official Agency

recognition she

deserves for

the many years she has made substantive contribution to the

CS.
