2. has asked that I state my preference with |

leave in July 1:53 but tt {a.not urgent that my leave be scheduled
exactly when due. I would like, however, to know what opporiuwiities
exist with headquarters and whether I should be looking elsewnere i
for employment after July 1953. = 4

2. ¥ith regam to another two yoar tour of duty in

here, Now that the station files are.sst-up and the aduinistrative ;
routine io established, my jJov, whnile termaxi Administrative Assist-

it, iB mainly that of a oclerk-typist. The practice in typing naa

becn good for me but I would like to look forward to a more re-
Bponsible job for the next tour of duty. For instance, as-a GS.
I am performing the same type job whish I did in 1445 ata CAF-4
and @ considerably leso responsible job than the one performed at
headquarters as @ P-2, While I_have been taking Spanish lessons,
i know that I am mot proficient enough In the language for an
assigneent in Latin America, and. feel that 1 would be better off
in another area.

3 benefit of the case officer in assigning a

replacement [has augsested that I outline the duties which
my replacement ald be trained to perform, The routine can be

loarned in the fleid within two or three weeks,

a) Copy typing. About 75% of the time will be taken
up with routine typing,

b) Index carding, About 600 index sards a week are now
being typed for the card files and for the visa section
riles.

ce) Preparation of courier mail. Couriers usually go

te the border approximately avery two weeks but there is
ta noregular schedule, end pouches are sometines prepared

on a few hours notice,

d) Cosenmications. The incumbent should have conplete

training for cur codes for he will not have mush practice
in the Meld as only two or three messages are transuitted

monthly.

[MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Ann L. GOODPASTURE erat
18 October 1970 ~ 31 October 1971

To the immense regret of this writer Ann Goodpasture

is retiring very soon. It would be silly to rate her 6 c
sompetitively against any of her colleagues, male or female,
young or merely well-preserved, Concerning her fitness be

it recorded that she is. very fit indeed to perform any of u
the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any othe.

I can think of -at alinost any grade, I Venture to-rate her
over-all performance, thirty years of it, as OUTSTANDING,

Ann -is one of the tough warp-threads on which this organiza-.
tion is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this
organization will be weakened,

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently
turns in a Strong performance when she,is not doing an out-
Standing job. She is an excellent office and project manager

iwho is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor

and briefer. Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS
and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization. I hope
she gets the official Agency recognition she deserves for

the many years she has made substantive contribution to the
