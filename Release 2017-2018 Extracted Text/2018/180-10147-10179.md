“TL. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select
Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for
Plans during 1963, described the ctais role in the
investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as
follows:

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense Mm » '

of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

Scelso described in detail to the Committee the
manner in which he conducted the Agency's investiga~

+..practically my whole Branch participated
in the thing. We dropped almost everything
else and I put a lot of my officers to work
in tracing names, analyzing files.
We were flooded with cable traffic, with
reports, suggestions, allegations from all

checked out. We were checking out just dozens
and dozens of people all the time. (HSCA Classified

to this Committee that the Agency's efforts to
gather and coordinate information related to
the assassination underwent a metamorphic
transition. Initially, Angleton noted, the

Director, Deputy Director, Division Chiefs and

requirements in a piecemeal fashion. However,
Angleton testified the Agency was eventually

able to focus its resources to avoid duplication

of effort and provide a system for the ‘central

The record reveals that during this second phase
of CIA information collection efforts in support of
the Warren Commisssion investigation the concentration

of Agency resources shifted in oe from exploration

that during this phase primary interest in support of the

Warren Commission was to follow-up on Soviet leads:
on the assumption that a person who spends

circumstances, had to be of specific interest

authorities. (HSCA Classified Deposition of

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, when I said to what extent
was the Cuban connection investigated, I don't mean by
the Warren Commission. I mean to what extent did the
Agency provide --

Mr. Rocca. That I can't answer. I certainly
didn't, do it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Pardon me?
Mr. Rocca. We certainly didn't, in R & A.
Mr. Goldsmith. So, CI/R & A did not --
Mr. Rocca. Go into the Cuban side of it at all.
This was something left to the people who were concerned
specifically with Cuban intelligence and security operation.
Mr. Goldsmith. But I believe earlier we

pertinent to the assassination was to go through your

Mr. Goldsmith. And once information pertinent

Mr. Rocca. Well --

Mr. Goldsmith. Based upon what you knew?
Mr. Rocca. Well, everything would go, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Therefore, you were in the

Mr. Rocca. Primarily, primarily. But I didn't
mean by that that it excluded the Cuban, because there
was a lot of material that came through and went to the
Commission that concerned the Cubans.

Mr. Goldsmith: “Let's go off the record.”

Mr. Rocca. My recollection is that at the time
the great press manifestation was that Cuban exiles who
were in touch with CIA had been somehow involved in this.
This was the great concern.

Mr. Goldsmith. That's another possibility.
There are different --

Mr. Rocca. Questions went down to WH: do you
have anybody who could possibly have gotten involved in
this kind of thing.

There was extraordinary diligence, I thought,
exercised to try to clarify that side.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you think that the possibility
of an assassination plot by Castro against the President
was adequately investigated?

Mr. Rocca. With the advantages of 20-20 hind-

As noted above, the CI Staff assumed responsibility
in late December 1963 ~ early January 1964 for the
coordination of CIA efforts to assist the Warren

A, Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of
the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of
the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-
generated information to the Warren Commission. The
general cansensus of these representatives is that the
Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful
working relationship during the course of the Commission's
investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,

Pp. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,

8/9/78, op y 24.) William Coleman, a senior staff counsel

for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent.

(See HSCA staff interview of William Coleman,
2/78) Mr. Slawson expressed a similar opinion

regarding the Agency's cooperation and quality

(Ibid. p. 24.) Mr. Rocca concluded that on this basis:

RRA,

"fhe CIA was to turn over and to develop any information
bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance
to the Warren Commission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the
supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was
propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

NY, “UT WHA,

Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the
CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination And the

(Ibid., p. 23.) He testified to the Committee that the
CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to
Warren’ Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard
Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony
regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-
mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:
An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-
mission). We would attempt to respond to it.
But these inquiries came in individual bits an®
pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we
could. (Ibid., pp. 10-11.)

oath he supported this proposition:

Mr. Goldsmith: In summary, is it your position that
the Agency gave the Warren Commission
information only in response to speci-
fic requests by the Warren Commission?

Helms: That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that

Memory is fallable. There may have been
times or circumstances under which some-
thing different might have occured, but
my recollection is that we were attempting
to be-responsive and supportive to the
FBI and the Warren Commission. When

between Committee Counsel and Mr. Helms illustrates

the iextent _ ?of the Agency's compromise:

Mr. Goldsmith: Mr. Helms, I take it from your
testimony that your position is
that the anti-Castro plots, in
fact, were relevant to the
Warren Commission's work; and,
in light of that, the Committee
would like ta be informed as to
why the Warren Commission was
not told by you of the anti-
Castro assassination plots.

Mr. Helms: I have never been asked to testify
before the Warren Commission about
. Our operations.

Mr. Goldsmith: If the Warren Commission did not
know of the operation, it certainly
was not in a position to ask you
about it.

Is that not true?

Mr. Helms: Yes, but how do you know they did
not know about it? How do you
know Mr. Dulles had not told he. 9 ar
How was I to know that? And besfes?
I was not the Director of the Agency
and in the CIA, you did not go
traipsing around to the Warren Com-
mission or to Congressional Committees
or.to anyplace else without the
Director's permission.

1964 concerned Oswald's trip to Mexico. In that memo

Slawson wrote that the tentative conclusions

he had reached concerning Oswald's Mexico trip,

These comments indicate that Slawson placed

qualified reliance upon the Mexican police summary.

Moreover, there is no indication that Slawson had

been provided the Duraif telephonic: intercept] tran-

scripts. In fact, by virtiié of Slawson's comments
concerning the Mexican police report, it would
appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,
had been provided-little substantive information

pertaining to Silvia Duran. As Slawson reveals,

the Commission had been forced to rely upon the two

memoranda that did not make reference to the surveil-

lance operations, and a summary report issued by

the Mexican Federal Police. Thus, the Agency had
ecledoad

“. for over three months:

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments
could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible
foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,
Saaeeae s conversation was identified

of pismerit item of information from

Agency’ s] Cuban and Soviet {kelephone }
ee might suggest foreknowledge
of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-
dent. This involves a faulty translation of an
answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer
to the latter's question as to whether she
had heard the latest news, Calderon said:
"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."
The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere
(the first person of the verb enterarsefe,
past tense) should be translated as .~I found
out (or I learned) about it -- the assassination
almost before Kennedy [aid7. "In other words,
Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting
of Kennedy almost at the time the event took
place..." (CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding

4 Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments
bite assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's
dese position that translation of Me Entere as

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's

Langosch paraphrased AMMUG's knowledge of Calderon

as follows:

Ai

_ DY LF LI LI EL LE

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have

had contact with Oswald because I learned
about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to Mexico, that she had been

involved with an American in Mexico. The
information to which I refer was told to

me by a DGI case officer... I. had commented
to (him) that it seemed strange that Luisa
Calderon was receiving a salary from the

DGI although she apparently did not do

any work for the Service. (The case officer)
told me that hers was a peculiar case and
that he himself believed that she had been
recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence
Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head

of the DGI, did not agree. As I recall,
(the case officer) had investigated Luisa
Calderon. This was because, during the time
she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted

a letter to her by an American who signed
his name OWER (phonetic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in
Spanish_s so I I an not,.sure of how the name

“mentioned ‘by (Hefnand zi should be spelled.

It could have been" Howard" or something my
different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love
letter but indicated that there was a
clandestine professional relationship
between the writer and Luisa Calderon.
I also understand from (the case officer)
that after the interception of the letter
she had been followed and. seen in the
company of an American. I do not know if
this could have been Oswald... (Ibid.)

above-referenced conversation of November 22,
1963? If so, please indicate when and

in what form this information was provided,
and which CIA official provided it. (HSCA
request letter of August 28, 1978)

The CIA responded by memorandum: —

"Although the (Mexico City)-~Station considered
the conversation Of Sufficient possible
interest to send a copy to headquarters,
the latter apparently did nothing with
it, for there appears to be no record in the
Oswald file of such action as may have
been taken. A review of those Warren
Commission documents containing information
provided by the Agency and still bearing a
Secret or Top Secret classification does
not reveal whether the conversation was
given or shown to the Commission."

(CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding Luisa
Calderon conversation, p. 1)

*The CIA memorandum states in part as follows:

When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-1's defection
and considered the possibility that he
might have some knowledge of the Oswald
case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions
to WH (Western Hemisphere) for debriefing
AMMUG-1...WH desk records reflect that
AMMUG-1 was debriefed on 4 May 64 regarding
this questionnaire.../B/ecause the debriefing
on the Oswald case was handled as a sensitive
matter, it was dictated directly to a CI
(Counterintelligence) stenographer on
5 May 1964. {Note: A-l was debriefed on
several subjects on 4 May 64. ‘The procedure
was to assign each subject discussed a
debriefing number and they were written
up in contact report form by the WH case
© officer. The instructions from CI staff
were to handle the Oswald case debriefing
very closely and not to keep any copies in
WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was
logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing
report number 40, but the report itself
was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly
to a CI staff stenographer. There would
be no reason to include the number 40 on
the report of this special debriefing for
CI staff, since it was their only debriefing
report. We are certain it is the debriefing
report (#40) because the date is the same;
it is the only debriefing report on Oswald °&
listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)
the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in
Oswald's 201 file.

a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA
eryptonym AMLASH/1) who, during 1962 while meeting
with a CIA representative expressed the desire to
assassinate Fidel Castro (Ibid., p. 84). Asa
result of AMLASH's expressed objective and the

(Ibid. pp. 104-106) During 1965, AMLASH and his

The most striking example of the CIA's direct
offer of support to AMLASH reported by the
1967 IGR states "it is likely that at the very

moment President Kennedy was shot a CIA officer

was meeting with a Cuban agent and giving

him an assassination device for use against CASTRO."
(Ibid.)

The 1967 IGR offered no firm evidence confirming
or refuting Castro's knowledge of the AMLASH operation
prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. ~The
1967 IGR did note that in 1965 when AMLASH was

Operation was in progress at the time
of the assassination; unlike the earlier
plots, the AMLASH operation could
clearly be traced to the CIA; and

unlike the earlier plots, the CIA had
endorsed AMLASH's proposal for a coup,
the first step to him being Castro's
assassination, despite Castro's threat
to retaliate for such plotting. No one
directly involved in either investigation
(i.e. the CIA and the FBI) was told of
the AMLASH operation. No one investi-
gated a connection between the AMLASH

operation and President Kennedy's

assassination. Although Oswald had been

in contact with pro-Castro and anti-
Castro groups for many months before the
assassination, the CIA did not conduct cy
a thorough investigation of questions

of Cuban government or Cuban exile

involvement in the assassination. (Ibid. p. 5)

In 1977, the CIA issued a s oo Series
General's Report concerning the subject of CIA

sponsored assassination plots. This Report, in

large part, was intended as a Hebucead of the
Church Committee's findings. The 1977 16k states:
The Report (of the Church Committee)
assigns it (the AMLASH operation)
characteristics that it did not have
during the period preceding the assassina-

tion of JFK in order to support the SSc

*In response to Langosch's. sworn statements, this

Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit

executed by Kent L. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who "served

as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the
entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs
Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it
progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent L. Pollock,
executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. 1) Mr. Pollock specifically
contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation
was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond
FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an
assassination operation. In pertinent part, Pollock te
drew the following conclusions:

fo the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald
considered the AMLASH operation to be a political
action activity with the objective of organizing
a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the
Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat. I heard
Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation
frequently, and never heard him characterize it as
an “assassiantion operation." Mr. FitzGerald
stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves
loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH
operation as an “assassigftion operation"; the

case officer did not; I,~as Executive Officer, never
discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with

Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the oth8r oe ts

branch chiefs and the special assistants could not
have so characterized it since they did not know
about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a
hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH
for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day
of President Kennedy's death. AMLASH rejected the
pen with disdain. /Ibid., par. 4, p. 2/), (Ibid.,

Depo. of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

Sait,

The Committee is in agreement with Mr. Rankin
that had the AMLASH operation been disclosed to
the Warren Commission, the Commission might have
been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture
that has surrounded the AMLASH operation during
the past decade. As history now records, the AMLASH
operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba and the United States.
