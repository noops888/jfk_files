1. Following cur conversation of a fev days ago I ackod_
Horeca N, Davis to look into the matter of sanding @ political
orgeniver tg Cubs to @ first-hand study on the scene. Mr. Davis
talked wii your staff and thay agroad that such
en orgent: could probably make a valuable contribution to the
Station's efforts vir-e-vis building up en affeetive opposition
to the Castro government.

2, Since ve do nct desire to blow cur intenticns to the
consultant prior to recetving a go-ahead from your Division, ve
cannot estimate the exact cost of the consultant's TOY, however,
thirty days on the come should not cost sare then $2,000, plus’
expenses and he aight come cheaper. This «ill be a subject for
discussion between Mr. Davia and the consultant at the tine the
proposal ia made to him, Wo believe he will make himself availeble
to go, however, we cannot guarentee it et this tine, Should tho
individual we have in mind bo unable to go ve will, of course, make
every affort to find a substitute.
