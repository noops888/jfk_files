®. LIMPTY/LIENTRAP has provided photos of inturedt to KUTUBE/D

of the LNERICK Installation and is presently working on similar

coverage of the DiLET Installation.

f.

In the area of pretext investigations, Oliver 0. SCANTLING perförmed

With excellence in a number of those.

Amone the more important

and revealing were those condueted on Juan NAVES Ruiz and LAMIQUELET-

2 and 3 (this later in conjunction wich Headquartera Interest in

the case).

B.

In support to other Station operations, Oliver 0. SCANTLINO has

aoting as alternate contnot of LIEMIT-l in a senaitive LAURICLE.

The LIMPTY outouts (SCANILING and CHRENDE) also service

a number of P.0. Box drope used in station operations inobuding

to cynosE activities and the LINuCK operation.

SCANTLING provided the cover correspondence for an Sw mail channol

with EMLITEA-1 while the latter was on asolenment to Santo Domingo.

3. Security

During the reporting period there have been no known adverse seourity

ineldents affeoting the LINPTY operalion.

Pieaiings botween the two outouts

under the profeat (SCANTLING and GRENDE) and the KUBARk Cane Officer, Jeremy L.

Narcos, are made in a clandestine manner and meting places and timos

changed frequently.

Meetings botween the cutouts and action agents are made

in a similar manner.

In order to provide maximum compartmentation between the various base- i

houses, Oliver O. SCANTLING was inserted an the outout to the LIMITED basehouse

and 1ts basehouse kcepers (LIMPIY-6 and LIEMPTY -8) In Dolober 1962.

He replaced

Raymond H. GRENDE In this task.: GERENDE continues no cutout for the LIENtiAP

LICALIA, and LILYRIC phase of LIENPTY.

In addilion, thig move makes for bettor:

rapport between the cutout and LIMPIY-6, (since LIiMPPY-6 and SCANTLING are

close in age) and gives GERENDE timo to provide more prompt processing of the

raw photo take.

(In regard to this development, it should be noted that

CaDE can no refusarly provede fintshed prouet within 24 hours - sooner
