CARDENAS, son of former Meatcan President Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio,
vinited the LIMERICK installation for a period of four and one-
half hours on 23 December 1963.

all arriving LIMERICK personnel, inéluding kiown and suspected
intelligence officers, plus documenting the daily routine of all
personnel of the LIMERICK installation.

@, LIEMPTY/LIENTRAP has provided photos of inturest to KUTUBE/D
of the LIMERICK, installation and is presently working on similar

coverage of the DMLET Installation,

f, In the area of pretoxt investigations, Oliver G, SCANTLING performed
swith éxcellence in a number of these, Among the-more important
and revealing were thosé conducted on Juan NAVES Ruiz and {AEMIQUELET-
2 and 3 (this later in conjunction with Headquarters interest in

the case),

In support to other Station operations, Oliver G. SCANTLING has
been acting as alternate contact of LIEMIT-1 in a sensitive LAURICLE
operation, The LIEMPTY cutouts (SCANTLING and GHRENDE) also service
a number of P.O, Box drops used in Station opsrations ineluding

with EMLITER-1 while the latter was on assignment to Santo Domingo.

3. Security
During the reporting period there have been no known adverse security
ineidents affecting the LIEMPTY operation, Meaiings between the two cutouts
under the project (SCANTLING and GERENDE) and the KUPARK Cane Officer, Joremy L.
Ntereos, are made in a clandestine manner and meeting places and times are
changed frequently, Meetings between the cutouts and action agents are made

in a similar manner,

In order to provide maxtaum compartmentation between tho’ various baso- |
houses, Oliver G,' SCANTLING was inserted as tho cutout to the LIMITED basehouse
and its basehouse keepers (LIEMPIY-6 and LIEMPTY-8) in October 1962. He replaced
Raymond H, GERENDE in this task, GEREMDE continues as cutout for the LIENTRAP
LICALIA, and LILYRIC phase of LIEMPTY. In addtLion, tnis move makes for better
rapport between the cutout and LIEMPIY-6, (since LIAMPTY-6 and SCANTLING ave.
close in age) and gives GERENDE time to provide more prompt processing of the
ray photo take, (In regard to tnis development, it should be noted that
GERENDE can now regularly provide finished produet within 24 hours - sooner

upon request).
