I have been asked by the Bahamas whether it would be possible.

to get a copy of an up to date list.

I am tempted

to refer them to?

"Air Guide", but not having been here at the time,

and not having a

copy of the original list in our records, I am somewhat at a lobs

as to the length of the list or the status of either "Air Guide"

or the Pilot's Association.

I quite appreciate that you may not be able to supply another

Iist but I should be glad to know more about the Pilot's Assoclution

before I return to the charge with the Bahamas.
