MEMORANDUM FOR: Privacy and Information Officer, DDO

SUBJECT: Weisberg Request (Martin Luther King, Jr.)
Part I
REFERENCE : 76-F-382

1. This office maintains a three volume sensitive
(unofficial) file on the Subject. We no longer maintain
201 file (201-760966); Dr. King's files and documents
were closed out on 6 November 1974 and forwarded to IP
files on 25 May 1976. A further check of other records
in this office revealed the following information relevant
to the Subject. While a large number of documents are
available which mention King, the majority are dated after
his death and in some way are related to world reaction to
his assassination which was on 4 April 1968, prior to the
implementation of the MHCHAOS program, 4 July 1968.

published) are considered releasable to the requestor.

FROM : : M. D, Stevens

-SUBJECT Flee | Xana, Coretta Scott

, #541 487

AKA: Mrs. Martin Luther KING
nee: Coretta SCOTT

1. Subject, without question, is the Coretta SCOTT referred
to in an FBI report onAlfreda ABELL, #355 109, dated 10/29/54, which ee
indicates that on 7 September 1951 ABELL, the Subject of a "Security r
Matter-C" type investigation, communicated with C, SCOTT, Route 1,

Box 158, Heiberger, Alabama, which address was identified as the resi-

dence of Coretta SCOTT. According to the postmaster at Heiberger,

(in 19542), Coretta SCOTT was then attending the New England Conservatory

of Music. (See attachment A) Mrs. Coretta Scott KING is said to have
attended this Conservatory and while there to have met her future
husband. (Sea attachment B)

. 2. Alfreda ABELL, who was a clerk in the UN Secretariat
from 1947 until 6/30/52 when her employment was terminated for security
reasons, was said in the New York Times on 2 January 1953 to be one of
25 former employees of the UN ousted as one believed to be a communist .. ‘
or under conmunist discipline. While employed in the UN, ABELL was
reportedly active on behalf of the Pro-Communist group of the UN Staff,
Committee and was friendly with, and actively participated in giving
a party in October 1951 to honor, four persons who had been dismissed
: by the UN for security reasons. (ie: Jeanne PICOU, identified as a
3 : member of the French Communist Party; Mary Jane KEENEY, a CP member
4 “ active in the Communist Party underground during the late 3Q's-early -
40's; Benedict Soloman ALPER, also reported to be a CP member; and
Rajah HOWRANI, who was reportedly a Communist Party member and had
received training in the Soviet Union. ‘The individual said to be responsi=
ble for ABELL's employment in the UN, and to-have been her supervisor .
there at-one time, was Adam TARN, a Polish citizen said to be a Communist
Party member. According to the FBI report on ABELL, she registered with:
the American Labor Party when voting in 1949 and 1952; subscribed to.‘
the National Guardian; and attended a W.E.B. DuBois testimonial dinner
in February 1951, to which she took. Hélen KAGAN as her guest.

_ 3+ ABELL ana Helen KACAN, who also was terminated at the UN
Seeretariat for security reasons, were reported in October 1952 to
gyequantly return to the UN premises where they were said to oftan
‘wu seen in its corridors conversing with certain Russians and alleged
Communists. According to a confidential FBI informant, ABELL in

rch 1952 made a check payable to KAGAN in the amount of $150, and
KACAN had made checks payable to ABELL on a number of occasions.
Helen KAGAN is Helen KACAN-POZNER, AKA: Elena Aleksandrovna Wilga, ete.,|
#348 486, who is suspected of having long engaged in Soviet intelligence
activities. Her brother, Vladimir A. POZNER, is an idertified KGB
officer and her cousin, Vladimir Wolf POZNER,is-a knows «ember of the
French Communist Party and is suspected of involvement in Soviet
intelligence. Her long-time consort, Peter WILGA, a leading figure
in the CPUSA, was also suspected of Soviet intelligence connections. -
Helen KAGAN-POZNER WILGA is of continuing interest to the FBI and
to SRS.

4. At a Senate Internal Security Subcommittee hearing in
New York City in late 1952, Alfreda ABELL refused on grounds of self-
incrimination to say whether she was then or ever had been a communist,
whether she tried to ‘organiza UN workers, or whether since leaving the
UN in the Summer of 1952 she had revisited UN headquarters in the role ‘
of a communist organizer. ‘The FBI continued to have an interest in :

ABELL until at least December 1961, the date of an FBI réport in her.

5. The postmaster at Heiberger, Alabama in advising regarding.
Coretta SCOTT, as stated above, commented that she had in.the past sung
on the same program with Paul ROBESON at ROBESON's personal invitation. !
(Louis BUDENZ has stated that prior to his, (BUDENZ), defection from i
the Communist Party in 1945, he knew Paul ROBESON as a secret member. -- 4

MEMORANDUM FOR: Office of General Counsel
ATTENTION : C/FOIA/PA

SUBJECT : Request For Opinion--FOIA (b) (6) §
Privacy Act

REFERENCE : FOIA Request 76-382, copy attached

1. Mr. Weisberg has requested under the FOIA
information on:

a. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
b. Earl Ray

c. Other individuals involved with the
assassination of Dr. King.

2. To ensure consistency in. making determinations
for release under both the FOIA exemptions (b) (6) and
the Privacy Act, of requests such as Mr. Weisberg's,
would you please state the current legal criteria t s
apply to these type cases. Specifically, it would be R
helpful to the DDO to. have a clearly enunciated legal uy —_—-
opinion regarding what, if any, privacy rights the family : AY
of a deceased individual might have vis-a-vis the agceased}
individual. Further, what, if any, privacy rights does
a convicted felon have. 7

3. We are aware that each case must be judged on
its own facts. Hence, we would be grateful for your
opinion regarding the criteria to apply to Mr. Weisberg's
request. However, a general rule applicable to the type
of request also would be very useful, would expedite the
processing of such requests, and would apply some consistency
in the decision-making process.

Dear Mr. Lesar:

This acknowledges receipt of your letter of 11 June 1976
on behalf of Mr. Harold Weisberg requesting, under provisions
of the Freedom of Information Act, access to any CIA records
dealing with Dr.-Martin Luther King, Jr., and/or James Earl Ray
and any of his alleged or suspected accomplices in Dr. King's
assassination, -°

I shall arrange for a search of CIA files and shall be in
further communication with you once the search has been completed
and any records found reviewed for releasability under the Act.

As you may know, the heavy volume of Freedom of Information
requests received by the Agency has resulted in processing back-
logs. If we do not respond within the 10 working days stipulated
by the Act, it is your right to construe this as a denial, subject
to appeal to the CIA Information Review Committee. It would seem
more reasonable, however, for us to continue. processing your request
and to respond as soon as feasible. Any denials of records could
be appealed at that time. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we
will assume that this is agreeable to you and proceed on this basis.

For your information, I am enclosing a copy of our fee schedule.
If the charges seem likely to be considerable, I shall provide you
with an estimate and perhaps require a partial payment in advance
of processing.

Sincerely,
/s/GFW

Dear Hr. Lesar:

You will reeall that our letter of 21 June 1976 acknowledged
receipt of your: letter on behalf of Mr. Harold Weisberg requesting,
under provisions ef the Freedom of Information Act, access to any
CIA records desling with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and to those
dealing with James Earl Ray and any of his alleged or suspected
accomplices in Dr. King’s assassinatios.

We find that. we are unable to respond to your request as it
now stands due to legal and regulatery restrictions on the release
of personal information from-official records. In that light,
please be advised that we can proceed-no further with your request
naless and until ws are in receipt of notarized statements of re-
lease from Mrs, Coretta King and James Earl Ray, respectively.
These statements should be quite specific as to what areas of
personal information are and are not authorized fer release by this “
Agency to-you and your client. If all information in our records
is releasable, that should be so stated; if only such information
as relates to specific incidents er to Specific periods of tine is
releasable, these caveats sheuld be clearly stated.

Finally, we must ask that you provide a statement of willing-
ness to pay search and duplication fees as required by this request
and ia line with the fee schedule enclosed. It has been estimated
that such charges could approach $1096. Along with the notarized
statements above, and the statement of willingness to pay all search
and copying charges (or these up to an established limit}, we would
require a down payment of half the anticipated charges. Payment
should be made to this office in the fora of a check or money order
payable to Treasurer of the United States.

December 3, 1976

Mr. Gene F. Wilson

Information and Privacy coordinator
Central Intelligence Agency
Washington, D. C. 20505

Dear Mr. Wilson: cae,

In response to your letter of November 30, 1976, Mr. Harold
Weisberg has: authorized me to state his willingess to pay search
and copying charges up to the amount of $1,000 if such charges are
required by his Freedom of Information Act request for records
pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and his assassination.
Because you require a down payment of half the anticipated charges,
I enclose a check for $500.00:

This payment of $500.00 and any subsequent payments made in
connection with this request are tendered with the express resgrva~
tion that Mr. Weisberg does not waive his right to recover them

C.I.A. regulations provide:

Records shall be furnished without charge

or at a reduced rate whenever the Coordina-
tor determines that waiver or reduction of
the charge is in the public interest because
furnishing the information can be considered
as primarily benefiting the general public.
The Coordinator also may waive or reduce the
charge whenever he determines that the inte-
rest of the government would be served there-
by. 32 C.F.R. §1900.25(a).

ae

In accordance with this regukatibn, I call upon you to
determine that it is in the public and governmental interest to
waive search and copying charges incurred in connection with Mr.
Weisberg's request. Enclosed herein is a copy of a letter to Deputy
Attorney General Harold R. Tyler, Jr. which makes a similar request
of the Department of Justice. The reasons expressed in that letter

for granting a waiver are incorporated in my request that you grant ~~

a waiver.

Should you require it, I will provide you with affidavits by
myself, Mr. Weisberg, and others in support of this request for a
waiver of the search and copying charges for these records. If you
do wish supporting affidavits, I would appreciate it if you would


inform me of this as soon as possible. I would also request
that you indicate what standards, if any, you have established
for determining whether or not a request for waiver should be

granted.

You state that you can proceed no further with Mr. Weisberg's
request “unless and until we are in receipt of notarized state-
ments of release from Mrs. Coretta King and James Earl Ray,
respectively." Because Mr. Weisberg's request undoubtedly com-
prises records which do not involve any proper claim of privacy,
this cannot be true. I do enclose, however, a copy of a notarized.
waiver by James Earl Ray. I will immediately contact Mrs. King
about a waiver by her. In the meantime, I request that you proceed
to make available those records responsive to Mr. Weisberg's re-
quest which do not involve any proper claim of invasion of privacy.

Sincerely yours,

Aunts

recently reappeared in the Fairbanks area with ite first publication
Gated May 1950. Previous editions of this newspaper appeared in the
Pairbanke area in carly 1955, but it was discontinued after
tiem of two editions dus to the refusal of a local printing firm to

the Alaskan Labor Defender:

present wave of race terror and hatred in the South is being fanned by
the White Citisens Councii. What is not generally known ia that this
verror is directed against any white workers who dare to solidarise
with Begroes. The murderous White Citisene Council are not only rebidly

the system of color segregation and sisorimination as the foundaticn
upon which rests the open snop structure of the "Right to Mork” South®. # # @

Also appearing in this issue ie en article relating that ths
Catholic Worker has protested the padlocking of the Daily Worker as a
violation of the freedom of the press.

Ap article appearing under the caption "Auto Workers Take Home Pay
Declines" reflects the “demand for a 30 hour week at 40 houre pay" by
the UAW, Pord Local 600, and the AFL-C10. Another article under the
caption *Ruploymant Falling Off; Productivity ie Increasing", quotes
JOM CLARK, preeident of the Internationei Union of Mine, Mill and
Sealter Workers, a8 stating that his union “Intends to do something”
about Geolining employment in the metale industry. Also set forth in

It's the first lie detector that
can be used on a dead

man. It works on tapes and
other voice recordings

by George O'Toole

ASSMAN al)

‘Tne rulars of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either
at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.
—Plato: The Republic, Book Three

I's a litle frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with
a high degree of retiability. whether or not you are lying. it's called the Psychological
Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect, a lie detector. Untike the polygraph, it needs
no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.
It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph
record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on

+ adead man.

Early thig year, one of these instruments came into my hands. | resolved to use
itto probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. | set about collecting every recording | could lay my hands on
of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon | had compiled the tape-
recorded testimony of twenty-two persons—eyewitnasses, Dallas policemen, the
pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,
Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Earl Warren.

| ran tha tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in
turn. Did te rifle which balonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?
‘Was Oswald he killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-
graphs which the Warren Commission never saw—do they support the Commission's
fone-gunman, single-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itsel?
Did its mambers conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture | expected. Not
all the details are there, but | guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory
of the Warren Report, or you may believe tha government-conspiracy theory of Mark
Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong.

‘The PSE is not a crystal ball. it was invented as an interrogation aid, a function

for historical research. To understand what | did with.the PSE, one should know some-

‘obtained a tape recording from CBS
News of a portion of a Sixty Minutes program
in which Mike Wallace interviewed Ciifford
Irving. The interview took place during the
height of the controversy, while Irving was
still claiming to have gotten Howard
Hughes’ life story through a series of inter-
views with the billionaire. it was a consum-
mate job of lying, embellished with such
convincing details as Irving's disagreement
with his colleague Susskind about whether
Hughes kept his organic prunes in a paper
or a piastic bag. Sixty Minutes re-ran the
segment after Irving’s confession because
the man’s sheer virtuosity as a prevaricator
was amazing. | was interested in the inter-
view for a different reason: at the height
of the controversy, Irving had been given
a polygraph examination and had passed

it. }wanted to see if the man who had beaten
the conventional lie detector could also
beat the PSE.

I selected a pointin the interview at which
Mike Wallace suggested that Irving had not
interviewed Howard Hughes, but had hap-
penedion some transcripts of Hughes’ state-
ments: Irving asked how he could have hap-
ened on them. Wallace rejoined, “Where
did you happen on those transcripts?” trv-

ing replied, “I got the transcripts from
Howard Hughes.” I charted this statemant
‘on the PSE.

It was a perfect example of total stress,
horizontally blocked, with the smooth,
“timmed-hedge" wave form. Clifford Irving
was a master liar, and he had beaten the
polygraph, but he would have been caught
by the PSE.

A few days after our first meeting, |
received a call from Bob Smith. He had
turned up a few things for me. | visited him
at the Committee's office in downtown
Washington. He gave me a tape recording
and a typewritten transcript. The recording
was the Lovis Lomax television program ot
Sunday, October 16, 1966. Wesley Liebler,
‘a mamber of the Warren Commission's statt,
was the guest. The transcript was of a CBS
News television program entitled The War-
ten Report, which had been broadcast in.
four one-hour segments on June 25, 26, 27
and 28, 1967.

| examined the transcript. The programs
had been narrated by Walter Cronkite and
other CBS newsmen. They reviewed every
major point of controversy that had been
raised by the critics of the Warren Report,
inierviewing eyewitnesses, Dallas police-
‘men, medical examiners. ballistic speci
ists and many others who had some inside
knowledge of the assassination of John F.
Kennedy. For what | had in mind, it was
a gold mine. I telephoned CBS and learned
that | could get a copy of the program's

Next | played the Lomax-Liebler tape.
Apparently Mark-Lane had betn onan -.
eariier Lomax program, and novi Liebler
‘was on to rebut him. | didn't need the PSE
to nnow that Liebler was stressed. He
seemed very agitated, and his breathing
audibly indicated his tension. He was angry
about the things Lane had said, the ques-
tions Lomax was asking him. and the reac-
ticn of the studio audience. Given his highly
emotional state, he did not seam a very
promising subjectfor the PSE. Nonetheless, °
I decided to give it a try.

Charting a tape with the PSE is a long
and tedious process. and itwas impractical
to chart the entire program: fran some of

a great deal of stress. He was pretty
charged up. :

Most of the exchange between Liebler,
Lomax and the audience was argumenta-
tive and did not deal with specific factual
points. t found two key statements by Lieb-
ler, though, and I charted them.

‘The first statement, ini response toa ques-
tion by Lomax, was, “I have no doubt about
the conclusions of the [Warren] Report.”
Plenty of stress was evident, but not much
‘more than in other statements.

‘The second statement related to those ”
Warren Commission documents which wer
not included in the Report—they wer
locked up in the National Archives. Lomax
asked Liebler if there was anything in the
documents which would alter Liebler's.
opinion. Taken literally, it was a strange
question, since Liebler had seen the docu-
‘ments and, if they would alter his opinion,
they would already have done so. Lomax
probably meant to ask if the documents
would conflict with the conclusions of the
Warren Report. Whatever Liebler thought
the question meant, he answered quickly,
“Oh, none, none at’all.” The PSE showed
much more stress here than during any of
Liebler's other statements.

Itwas all pretty confused and fuzzy, and
itdidn't tell me more than I'd already known:
Wesley Liebler was pretty upset when he
appeared on the Louis Lomax program.

result of his predicament, and Garrison's
might also be the result of some outside
issue. The situation was ambiguous.

{ran the testimony of Lee Odom. Odom,
a Datlas businessman, was attempting to
explain the mysterious coincidence of the
post office box numbers. It seems that the
Dalias post office box number 11906
appeared in the notebooks of both Clay
Shaw and Lee Harvey Oswald. In his tes-
timcny. Odom stated that he could not

Oswald's notebook, he knew how it got inta,
Shaw's. It was Odom's box number, and
he had given it to Shaw. whom he'd mat
by chance on a business trip to New
Orleans. The PSE showed hard stress dur-
ing his statement. No unrelated control
stalement was available for me to run for
comparison.

This didn’t really clear things up. There
were several obvious alternative explana-
tions for Odom's stress. For example, there.

The coincidence of the box numbers
seemed very suspicious. but Bob Smith of
the Committee had pointed out to me that
‘both Shaw's and Oswald's notebooks were
filled with numbers, so the chance of such
‘a coincidence was not that remote.

Atthis point | began to wonder if the tele-
vision camera was the “outside issue” in
every case. Perhaps just being ontelevision
will 50 thoroughly rattle the average person
that, lying or not, he is going to show stress
‘on the PSE. | checked this out by recording
‘and charting a number of people on tele-
vision programs—public officials, men in

gruesome accident. There was occasional

Mr. Shaw should neverhave been arrested.”
He was asked if Garrison had known of cer-
tain illegal and unethical methods Gurvich
had allaged were being used by Garriso

He ordered it.” There was no stress in Mr.
Gurvich's statements. The PSE showed that

timony from a targe enough number of wit-
nesses to create a detailed picture of the
Garrison-Shaw affair, butit seems probable,
that, at the very least. Garrison did not have
much of a case against Shaw (a view later
held by a New Orleans jury) and likely that
‘Shaw was completely innocent of complic-
ity in the assassination. The lesson of this
episode is twolold. First, stress in any one
person's testimony does not prove decep-
tion. Second, given enough testimony by
different witnesses, the PSE can arrive at
‘the truth.

‘The first person | ran on the PSE who had
any direct knowledge of the assassination
was Oswald's widow, Marina. Unfortu.
nately, only one of her'statements was on
the CBS tapes—that Oswald had owned @
rifle. The PSE said she was telling the truth.”

‘The rifle had been one of the major points
of controversy raised by critics of the War-
ren Report. The debate centered on two
points: whether the Mannlicher-Carcano
alleged to have belonged to Oswald was
the rifle found by the Dallas police in the
Texas Schoo! Book Depository, and whether
that particular gun could have been the mur-
der weapon.

‘On the tapes, Darrell C. Tomlinson, an
employee of Parkland Hospital, testified
that he had found a rifte bullet on a strefcher
which he believed had carried Governor
Connally. There was no stress in. his state-
ment. The PSE said he was telling the truth.

Dr. Joseph D. Nicol, Superintendent of
the Bureau of Criminal investigation for tha
State of lilinois. ran ballistic tests on bullet
fragments found in the: presidential timou-
and on the intact bullet found by Tom-
finson. Nico! testified that both the intact
bullet and the bullet fragments had been
fired by the Mannlicher-Carcano. He. too,
was apparently telling the truth.

Deputy Constable Seymour Weitzman of
the Dallas police claimed that he found
‘Oswald's Mannticher-Carcano on the sixth
floor of the Texas School Book Depository.
However. on the day of the assassination,
he hadtold the press thatthe rifle he'd found
was a German Mauser. The following day
he signed an affidavit to that effect. But on
the CBS tapes he testified that he had been
mistaken about that point, that it had really

was almost no stress in this statement.

Officer Jacks of the Dallas police, who
was riding in the limousine of Vice-
President Johnson, denied that any of the
shots had come from the direction of the
grassy knoll. The PSE turned up a fair de-
gree of stress.

‘Three witnesses, Mrs. Caroline Walther,
Amold Rowland and Howard Brennan,

from the notorious unreliability of eyewit-

amount of Deception, if it is

may have been:darker reasons.

‘There is, however, other evidence and

Perhaps the most dubious and controversial
element in the Warren Commission's ver-
sion of the event—the autopsy.

nédy had been rushed to the emergency
room at Parkland Hospital, where Dr. Mal-
‘coim Perry tried to save his fi
cian saw that the Presid
amassive head wound anda smaller wound

in the throat. Perry performed a tracheos-

tomy, cutting through the throat wound in
an attempt to open a breathing passage.
Afterward, when hope for the President had
‘been abandoned, Perry met with the press
and declared that the wound in the front
of the neck had been an entry wound.
The President's body was flown to
Washington, D.C. There, approximately
ight hours alter the shooting, an aulopsy
was performed at Bethesda Navat Hospital.
Because of the tracheostomy. the nature of
the neck wound could no fonger be ob-
served and was, at first, overlooked. Later,
after consulting the Dallas doctors, the
Bethesda pathologists concluded that it
was an exit wound. The autopsy report
stated that there were two entry wounds,
‘one tow in the rear scalp and one ‘at the
right base of the neck; and two exit wounds,
the throat wound and a large irregular
‘wound on the right side of the head.
‘The confusion was compounded when
two FBI agents present at the autopsy

feported that a wound had been found in”

the President's back, and that no corre-
‘sponding exit wound had been located.

Diagrams made during the autopsy seemed ©

to confirm this, showing the lower of the
two entry wounds to be below the shoulders,
not at the base of the neck. What became.
‘of the bullet? The agents reported that
Bethesda doctors thought the bullet had
dropped from the wound when the Dallas
doctors attempted extemal heart massage.
But this was the shot that the Commission
claimed had passed through Kennedy and
struck Govemor Connally.

X-rays and color photographs of the au
topsy were made. The brain ws moved
from the body. Brain and skin ti
were prepared for microscopic e1
tion. Remarkably, the Warren Commission
Mever asked to see any of this evidence,
relying instead solely on the testimony of
Captain James J. Humes. one of the
Pathologists who conducted the autopsy.
Even more incredible is the disappearance
of the brain, the slides, and some of the
photographs, which were alleged to have
been tumed over to the National Archives
by the Bethesda Naval Hospital.

Both Dr. Perry and Captain Humes were
interviewed on the CBS tapes. Perry was
asked about the throat wound he'd seen
when the President was brought to Parkland
Hospital. His answer seamed evasive. He
neither confirmed nor denied that he had
thought it was an entry wound, talking in-
‘stead about the difficulty of making such
a determination and the fact that his atten-
tion had been devoted to saving the Presi-
dent's life. Then the interviewer asked him
directly whether he had thought at the time
thatitwas an entry wound. “Actually. kdidn't
teally give it much thought,” he replied. He

The PSE said he was telling the truth.

John McCloy. a member of the Warren

and added that he had seen no credible
evidence to contradict the findings of the

this. but it failed to do so when, speaking
of the Warren Report, he said, “There was,

of a few pieces of inconvenient evidence
which conflicted with a version of events
they believed to be essentially true:

Warren said that immediately after the as-
sassination there were two theories, one that
Khrushchev and Castro were behind the
Killing, the other that a group of right-wing
Texas cilmen were responsible. He said:

“We explored both of those theories for

‘stress: “member.” Coutd he have been

by others.

far as the private resources of a free-lance
writer permit.

What, given the sample of testimony 1
have processed with the PSE, cen ! say
about the assassination?

‘We should first examine the testimony in
whichno stress was found, since itis almost
certain that these people were telling the
‘truth as they saw it. This strongly suggests
the fotlowing:

1. Oswald owned a rifle.

2. A bullet fired from that ritle was found
on Govemor Connally's stretcher at Park-
land Hospital.

3. Bullet fragments alleged to have been
found in the presidential limousine also
‘came from Oswald's rif

4. At least one eyewitness believes he
saw gunsmoke on the grassy knoll, but
another is equally certa
from that direction.

‘5. Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippitt.

6. At least one member of the Warren
Commission and one member of the Com-
mission's staff really believe in the validity
of the Warren Report.

unexpected possibility emerges:

Oswald was involved in some way in the
assassination, if only as a fall guy. Some of
the Dallas police force may have been in-

cated Oswald, and covered up the fact that
there was a conspiracy. The medical exam

tunately, | do not know that, But the PSE
analysis of the assassination tapes has
generated a staggering amount of fre:
doubt regarding the Warren Report.
doubt rises not only trom specific points
the PSE has called into question, but from
the very sinister implications of the very
existence of deception among policemen,
government officials and Commission
members. The question remains: did such
deception exist or was the stress found by
the PSE the result, in every case, of an out-
side issue?

ine rot ano cannot be cross-checked by

a structured interrogation, some probability
must be accepted that this stress is caused *

by an outside issue. No study has yet been
conducted to establish what this probability
might be, but let us pick, for the sake of
discu figure that may seem ridiou-
ously high—70 percent. in otherwords, we
are assuming that 70 percent of the times
the PSE finds stress in testimony, it results
from somet other than lying.

Now, let's ignore the deception indicated | ~

in the testimony of the eyewitnesses; even
if present, it might have resulted from mare
desire for attention. That leaves eight “in
siders"who have demonstrated stress when
making statements supporting the Warren
Report: the Dallas policemen Hill, Jacks,
Jackson and Weitzman; the medical exam-
iner, Captain Humes; Commission stafler

Wesley Liebler, Commission member John

McCloy; former Chief Justice Eart Warren.

Assuming that there is a 70 percent
chance that any single instance of stress
is “outside issue,” what is the probability
that all eight instances are due to factors
other than deception? Elementary proba-
bitity theory tells us that it is seven-tenths
raised|o the eighth power, or approximately
6 percent.

In ather words, even making some fairly
conservative assumptions, there is a 94 per-

cent chance that at least one of these eight

men Is lying.

‘My own personal opinion? I don’t know. ”

(remember the young man with the ring.
He said he was wearing it, and he was,
‘but he stressed. He stressed not because
he was lying, but because there was some-
‘thing about that ring that really bothered
him, something he didn't want the world to
know. Perhaps that is also true of these men
who, in one way or another, leamed some
part of the truth about the assassination of
John F. Kennedy.

U suppose I'm not absolutely sure even
of that. When | first met Bob Smith of the
Committee, | asked him if there was any
‘one thing the govemment could do to clear
up the mystery. Yes, he replied, the one
thing that would help more than anything
else would be to make available the phys
cal evidence — the detailed FBI tab re-
ports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs,
the microscopic slides, the bloodstained
clothing, yes, even the President's brain,
r ithas been hidden. These things,
‘would go far toward answering the
‘questions about what actually happened
that day in Dallas. Maybe they would ever:
confirm the Warren Report.

‘So when | say I'm not absolutely certain
these men are concealing something, !
mean | can think of something that could
conceivably change my mind. Thatis, ifthe
government would open all its files on this
matter to us and prove that we are wrong

believe we haven't yet heard thetull account

Attachment to CIR-316/03107-73

SUBJECT: Conference of the Committee to Investigate Assassinations,
Report on Proceedings 23 November 1973

1 The Committee to Investigate Assassinations claims to
have been established in 1969. The headquarters are in Washington, D.C.
{at 1520 16th Street, N. W.). In the four years of its existence the
Committee has done research and has become a kind of clearing
house for the study of assassinations, It maintains contact with
other groups engaged in similar activity, of which there seem to be
at least two, one of which is located in the Boston area,

2. In addition to research, the Committee acts to help
individuals interested in the investigation of assassinations. It thus
files suits for private persons demanding access to classified
information. It sponsors the publication of books and articles
relating to the field of its interest, and sponsors the production of
movies. It publishes a newsletter.

3. The conference of November 23-24, 1973, is the first of
its type to be held by the Committee. The Georgetown University
was helpful by placing Gaston Hall at the disposal of the Committee
free of charge. By agreement with the University, the Committee
will also be able to use the services of the University Library asa
repository and research center.

4. The Conference opened on November 23, 1973, with a delay
of about half an hour. The delay may have been due to the installation
of recording equipment which literally covered the premises with a
tangle of wires of every kind. The Washington Post reports an
attendance exceeding 300. This is a generous estimate. After
deducting official speakers, recording personnel, and press

‘representatives, the audience probably numbered no more than 150,

if that many.

5. Beards and long hair prevailed, and others stood out like a
sore thumb. There was not a single Negro in the audience, nor, that
morning, on the platform, Even the speaker who spoke on the case
of Martin Luther King was white.

6. Not all the speakers preannounced were present, The
chairman announced the absence of Richard Sprague. Another
speaker, a lawyer from Los Angeles whose name was drowned
out in the noise, was also absent. They were replaced by Dr. Robert
Forman and someone whose name sounded like 'Ed Kirkley".

7. The chairman announced that all the speeches would be
tape recorded for subsequent publication, He further invited the
audience to attend movies to be shown that night. One of these,
"Burn", was to be shown at the University. Others by prearrangement
‘would be shown at local movie theaters, The latter were connected
with the Kennedy assassination. The case of the President's murder
was in the center of the conference and, as noted by one of the
organizers (Smith), one half of the speakers were to center their
attention upon the Oswald case.

8. The chairman adhered strictly to the program and every
speaker mentioned in the program for the morning session of
November 23 spoke as specified. Of those who spoke, Norman
Mailer, Robert P. Smith and Ronald Van Doren deserve particular
attention. Their speeches in summary are reviewed below.

9. A table at the back of the audience presented recommended
literature. The books included H. Weissberg's Whitewash and
Peter Noyes' Legacy of Doubt. For some reason there was a copy
of one paper only, that of George O'Toole's "Assassination Tapes".
There was also a bibliography of political assassination; the foreword
to which lists the persons most actively collaborating with the
Committee,

iN

OLUREI

10, <A publication circulated during the conference was the
November, 1973 issue of Computers and Automation which is to
be renamed, starting January 1, 1974, Computers and People.
The publication of articles such as "Nixon and the Mafia" which
concludes that Richard M. Nixon seems to be the embodiment of
a prediction that organized crime would someday put its own man
in the White House, seems somewhat curious in a magazine devoted
to the profession of data processing and the use of computers.
The magazine was established in 1951 by Berkeley Enterprises in
Massachusetts, Alger Hiss is among its contributors and an
abundance of articles by Richard Sprague on the subject of Watergate
published in the past year.

ll, Another organization which received publicity at the
Conference was The Committee for Action/Research on the
Intelligence Community (CARIC).

12. A representative of Computers and Automation handed out
this publication free of charge to members of the audience. He took
notes with fantastic speed and apparent accuracy of everything said
during the proceedings.

13. The lights gave out at one point and did not come on again
during the morning session. The absence of current may have
affected the tape recording. :

14, The morning session, due to close at 12:30, ended after
1:30 p.m. By this time the audience was impatient to have lunch,
and the resumption of the proceedings was therefore postponed toa
later hour. :

15. No document of any kind was issued to the persons who
paid $15.00 to enter. Instead their hand was stamped with the name
of the organization which gave them access to all further meetings
that day and the next (the members of the audience were apparently
not supposed to wash their hands during this time). Names were
taken down, but no questions asked other than one's initial. No
information on address, occupation, etc. was required.

‘ 16. Speech by Norman Mailer. This was beyond a doubt, the
most striking presentation during the Friday morning session.
Mailer spoke briefly and left the conference shortly after the speech.

17. Mailer said that political intelligence as a subject was as
powerful as "peace". Interest in assassination is obsessive. The
obsession arises from the fact that a solution to the problem is not
found, and attention is constantly drawn back to the unanswerable
question.

. 18. He said that we have here the most powerful nation in the
world which cannot come to grips with a question which seems as
amazingly simple as the Kennedy assassination, The result has
been that this nation has decided to shut down investigation and has
thus alienated itself from its own history. This alienation has
brought apathy, a trait noticeable in the reaction to investigations
which bring no wide response.

19, A nation which rejects its own history is on the path toa
totalitarian regime. Facts, meanwhile, have a peculiar ability to
change when they are investigated, and investigators must therefore
rely upon hypothesis, The history of the last ten years has been
made unendurable by the abundance of hypotheses. They range
from the opinion that an assassination is an accident lacking any
particular sequence to the hypothesis that secret police forces are
engaging in a world conspiracy.

20. The present conference must help us to learn whether
there are possibilities, and what possibilities exist, to solve these
questions. 7

21. Speech by Robert P, Smith, Mr. Smith was described as

the director of research of the Committee, but he seems to be one
of the major motive forces in this organization,

22. Mr. Smith pointed out that he had spent the last three years
studying the Kennedy case. Much research had been done, but
nothing had changed, so far as practical action was concerned, in
the last nine years,


13-00000

SECRET

27. Speech by Ronald Van Doren. Mr. Van Doren seems to be a
follower of Governor Wallace. He began by commenting on the sad
situation in a country with a judiciary where individuals have to make
conjectures regarding a case as obvious as that of Bremer. There is
no doubt that Bremer pulled the trigger. But one should examine the
political situation at the time of his action, Wallace was by far the
leading candidate in the election campaign, a threat to other candidates,
and he was winning the nomination. He represented a challenge to
both parties. Nothing he said could be interpreted as racist, and in
the economic sense he carried wide appeal. The question which faced
the other candidates was how he could be stopped from disrupting the
two parties and from preventing the re-election of the President.
History will show how he was stopped and why this occurred.

28. The case in defense of Wallace's civil rights was quietly
dropped. No proper investigation was conducted. As usual in
assassination cases there was a diary. It showed that Bremer was
acting alone and was deranged. Read as a piece of literature, the
diary presents Bremer as a non-person, an illiterate unable to spell.
There is nothing regarding the people he worked with. Meanwhile, if
one examines Bremer's background, he appears an entirely different
person. Why did he travel repeatedly to Ottawa? How did he manage
to carry guns on planes? What was he doing in New York? Why was
he in Washington? And where did he get his funds? The apartment
he rented exceeds his annual income. His mother could not afford
to visit him in prison, yet he dressed well. With whom was he
involved? F

29. All this should be looked into, Watergate brought the
electoral campaign to the fore. Why has discussion of the Bremer
shooting been excluded from the investigation? Bremer.was a part
of the 1972 campaign, yet there is no mention of Wallace or of
Bremer. Two years from now Wallace will be back,

30, Speech by Ms. Meredith Rode. Ms. Rode was very brief.
She said she became interested in the killing of George Lincoln Rockwell

in 1970, and that the case was built on circumstantial evidence exclusively.
The case is still open, for the police believe that there was an accomplice.
No funds are available for defense. ?

23. Although the National Archives are the repository for the
Kennedy assassination documents, the FBI and the CIA are
responsible for restricting research. Much of the 300 cubic feet
of documents have been printed, a reclassification in 1971 has
released 3,000 pages, and the CIA later released more, but none of
the material released has created any sensation. The Freedom
of Information Act is not as liberal on assassination material as on
other matters, Some material was not even turned over to the
Warren Commission, The FBI and the Justice Department are alone
in knowing the results of some tests.

24, ‘In the non-governmental area, much has been published,
and the book by Peter Noyes must be singled out particularly.

25. Speech by Mr. Robert Hanson, Mr. Hanson has become

the counsel for Sirhan Sirhan. He studied to become an engineer
and then shifted to law. (To judge from the number of cases which
he says he has lost, heshouldhave remained an engineer instead of
becoming an attorney. )

Mr, Hanson said that the Sirhan case is pretty hopeless.
The trial was based on a 100 per cent belief in Sirhan's guilt,
Therefore important witnesses were not called, and no attention
was paid to ballistics. Scientific study, however, indicates that
Sirhan Sirhan may not even have been the person who committed
the crime, But even if it is proved that his gun did not kill
Robert Kennedy, this discovery may have no influence upon Sirhan's
case. California officials have no desire to reopen the case and
funds to handle the proceedings are lacking. A book by Tiger on
the case is worthy of note. Tiger claims that Sirhan Sirhan was
acting under hypnotic influence.

26. Speech by James Lesar. Mr. Lesar, who spoke on the
Martin Luther King assassination, declared that Ray was innocent,
and that the FBI and the Justice Department were responsible for
wrongly solving the crime. Ray was framed by conspirators. The
persons presently involved in Watergate played a role in the Ray
case investigation. No private agency - only a government agency -
can solve the Ray case. All depends on whether the judiciary acts
honestly or with political consideration in mind. As it stands today,
we see Ray's rights having been abominably violated; we see lawyers
who did not do their job; and we see nothing approaching an open
hearing.

Now former intelligence workers and concerned citizens have
w-ued a national association to provide the vita’ information an aware
needs to know about government operations. The Committee for
\stinn/Research on the Intelligence Comniunity (CARIC) is an
aJependent “watchdog” on the government spy apparatus. CARIC,
pavsored entirely by donations from American citizens, serves as an

ajanization and objectives of U.S. Intelligence, What clandestine
perations are being carried out in the name of America? Is the CIA

iparing to entangle us in another war similar to the Indochina War?
“Wat information is ging into Federal, State, local and private data

h: euestions CARIC is answering.

ZARIC knows that all conscientious Americats are closely watching

Who knows what future political espionage will occur under the
guise of so-called “national security” or loyalty to an administration?
Only time will tell, but through diligence and your help CARIC will
anticipate and bring to your attention situations within the government
that are likely to produce a new “Watergate.”

Although CARIC does believe that a massive government spy
apparatus is at work in the world, we hope to dispel some of the
paranoia citizens naturally feel when there is talk of spics and wiretaps.
We know that the FB! does not have agents behind every. tree, but there
are agents in avery major community in this country who have spicd on
innocent private and public citizens. Only a full and undisguised look
Into this hidden world can displace unwarranted fears, and guide the
public effort to end this illegal and unjustified espionage. The secrecy
with which the government surrounds itself must end.

CARIC knows that tens of thousands of American citizens from ail
walks of life were mobilized over the past decade to help bring an end
to the government's war in Indochina — a war that has taken new forms
under the direction of U.S. Intelligence agencies. CARIC hopes that
these same concerned citizens will continue to oppose the policies of
our government which bring this new form of covert war and the
Watergate scandals. It is now time for thousands of Americans to
mobilize to stop the spying as we stopped the dying. Please join us in
our effort.

THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY:

THE APPLICATION OF COMPUTERS
TO THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE oy

Part 1. Introduction

Who Assassinated President Kennedy?

On Novenber 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, President
John F. Kennedy, while riding in an open limousine
through Dealey Plaze and waving to the surrounding
crowds, was shot to death. Lee Harvey Oswald, an

Marine, and former visitor to the Soviet Union,

5 orresied that afternoon in a movie theatre in
Another section of Uallas; that night he was charged
with shooting President Kennedy from the sixth floor
easternmost window of the Texas School Book Deposi-
tory Building overlooking Dealey Plaza, This act
Oswald denied steadily through two days of question-
ing (no record of questions and answers was ever
Preserved). Two days later while Oswald was being
transferred from one jail to another, he was shot
by Jack Ruby, a Dalles night-club owner, in the
basement of the Dallas police station, while mil-
Lions of Anericans watched on television. The com
mission of investigation, appointed by President
Lyndon B. Johnson, and headed by Chief Justice Earl
Warren of the U. S, Supreme Court, published its
Feport in Septenber 1964, and concluded that Oswald
was the sole assassin and that there was no conspir-
acy.

In view of the authority of the Warren Conmis-
sion, that conclusion was accepted by many Anericans
for e long time, But the conclusion cannot be con-
sidered true by any person who carefully considers
the crucial evidence — such as the physics of the
Shooting, the timing of a number of events, and
other important and undeniable facts. In other
words, Oswald was not the sole assassin, and there

This article will develop that thesis, prove it
to be true on the basis of substantial, conclusive
dence, and in particular sone analysis of the

Photographic evidence.

There was in fact a conspiracy. Oswald played
8 role in the conspiracy, although there is con-
elusive evidence that on November 22, 1963, he did

he claimed when he was in the Dallas jail,

y four) —'none of whom were in the sixth floor
sternmost window of the Texas School Book Depos-
Atory bullding where the Warren Commission placed
Osweld — fired 9 total of six shots at President
Kennedy.

One Of these shots missed entirely: one hit

these statements about the shots consists of:

(a) the physics of the motions of Kennedy and Con-
nally shown in some 60 frames of the famous film
by Abraham Zapruder; (b) the locations of the in-
Juries in Kennedy and in Connally; and (c) more
than 100 pictures, consisting of more than 30
Still photographs and more then 70 frames of mo-
vies.)

More than 50 persons were involved in the con-
spiracy at the tine of firing the shots. These
persons included members of the Dallas police force

THE PURSUIT OF IMPORTANT TRUTH

‘The magazine Computers and Automation has for more

than three years followed an unusual publication policy:

— The pursuit of truth in input, output, and pro-

cessing, for the benefit of people,
and an unusual belief:

— That computers are too important to be left to
computer experts and must be integrated into a
socially responsible profession of information
engineering.

WHBE+this policy has operated most is in publishing
information, articles, and reports on subjects which a
great many liberal and progressive newspapers and peri
Odicals have left unexplored or unmentioned:

— The political conspiracies which have led to the
essassination of President John F. Kennedy, Sena-
tor Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and
others — and their coverups

— The conspiracies, coverups, and lies in connection
with the pursuit of war in Indochina and dictator-
ship by the Saigon regime

— The connections of President Richard M. Nixon
with organized crime and the Mafia

— The Watergate crimes

If you believe in the value of truthful, frank reporting

‘on the most important topics for the welfare of the
people of the United States today, we urge you to sub-
scribe to our magazine, and buy our back copies (almost

every one is in print). Please help us pursue the important

‘uth and report on it, by buying our products.

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical...

Computers end Automstion, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine inthe field of com~

puters ond deta processing, believes that the prow
fession of informstion engineer includes not only
competence in handling information using computers
and other means, but also # broad responsibility,
in @ professional and engineering sense, for:

— The reliability and social significance of
pertinent input

— The sociel value and truth of the output
results. 5

In the same way, a bridge engineer takes 2 pro-
fessional responsibility for the reliability and
jgnificence of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for hu
beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers end Automation publishes
from time to time articles and other infornation
related to socially useful input and output of date
systems in @ broad sense. To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical

but productive of thought ond on improved and
fer “house” for all humanity, an earth in which
our children end later generations may have # fu-
ture, instead of facing extinction.

The professional information engineer needs to
relate his engineering to the most impor

most serious problens in the world toda:
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population explo—
sion, and many more.

The Understanding of Natural Language by Computers

Proposition: Computers are making long strides towards
‘understanding natural language as used by human
beings, and will eventually understand such language
as well as many human beings do,

‘What do we mean by: computers? understanding lan-

guage natural language? And what is the evidence for this
proposition?

The word “computers” here refers to powerful comput-
xs that have appropriate programs written by human be-
ings plus the programmed capacity to improve their pro-
grams by using experience. An example of such improve-
ment is Dr. A. L. Samuels’ famous checker-playing pro-
gram, which can learn from experience, and which plays
far better checkers than Dr. Samuels himself can play.

‘The experience may consist of the following at least:

Answers from human beings to questions posed by
the computer;

Differences between computed results and a priori
specified results;

‘Signals from the environment, such as instrument
readings;

Information obtained by “looks” at the environment,
as for example recognition of the character A, as
in optical character recognition;

The interpretation of words, as with FORTRAN ex-

* pressions.

Probably there are even more categories of experience
which a powerful computer program can use to modify it~
self to become even a better program,

In regard to “understanding language”, there are over
$00 languages which computers have been programmed to
understand, when written precisely according to stated
rules: among them, BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL, many
kinds of machine language, etc.

“Natural language” is the ordinary language used by hu-
man beings, subject to the requirement that for a computer
implicit understandings must be stated. For example, when
a speaker exclaims “Ouch!”, a great deal of the meaning
comes from the listener’s observations of the speaker. But
@ computer, like a blind man, cannot “see” the situation,
and must be told more than the ordinary listener.

With some definitions taken care of, let us consider evi-
dence for the main proposition stated above, This evidence
includes the information published in several recent ar-
ticles in Computers and Automation. ~

The article “Do What | Mean’ — The Programmer's As-
is by Warren Teitelman, in the April 1972 issue,
described a “‘programmer’s assistant”, called “DWIM”; this
was a “front end” or preprocessor to an interactive pro-
gam for operating with LISP expressions. The front end
was tolerant of the programmer's mistakes in typing, in low-

mistake occurred, it would inquire of the human program-
mer what he meant, suggesting the correctly spelled alter-
native, and so on. In this way the human programmer was
relieved of much of the burden of expressing himself ex-
actly and correctly the first time, and his efficiency in
using the LISP interactive program greatly increased.

The three articles “Computer Programming Using Natu
ral Language” by Edmund C. Berkeley, Andy Langer, and
Casper Otten, in the June, July, and August 1973 issues,
demonstrated the understanding by a computer program
called GENIE of at least some sets of instructions in ordi-
nary natural language. The vocabulary though small was
free; and there was unlimited freedom in putting the words
together, with about a 90% chance of complete under-
standing. The computer program that did this could be
called 15% GENIE, because, as the authors emphasized, it
was still in an early stage of development.

‘The article “Latest Computers See, Hear, Speak, and
‘Sing — and May Outthink Man” by David Brand, in the
October 1973 issue, enumerated many instances of com-
puters (and robots equipped with computers) which could
deal with concepts expressed in natural language. One of
the programs mentioned could for example decipher natu-
ral language commands dealing with the stacking of blocks
of various shapes, sizes, and colors.

The main tasks for understanding natural language ap-
pear to be the following:

Recognition of the framework of a sentence;

Recognition of the common meaning of groups of
synonyms, the collection of words that “say
the same thin,

Knowledge of context: the context is regularly
specified to the computer, so that it does not
mar to deduce the context from “what is being
said”;

Knowledge of a limited vocabulary consisting of per-
haps 300 to 500 words — knowledge in the sense
that the computer program can attach meaning to
the words either by themselves or in phrases, as
for example it may attach the meaning of doing
‘something three times to the numeral 3;

Capacity to accept variation in the way something is
stated by a human programmer.

‘The three articles referred to above show instances of
the achievement of all of these tasks separately. Combin-
ing all the achievements should not be too hatd, especially
since children as young as four years old show complete
capacities to listen to many kinds of natural language, un-

derstand, and respond.

REASONS TO BE INTERESTED IN THE FIELD OF
COMMON SENSE, WISDOM, AND GENERAL SCIENCE

COMPUTERS are important —
But the computer field is over 25 years old. Here is » new
field where you can get in on the ground floor 10 make
your mark.

MATHEMATICS is important —
But this field is more important than mathematics, because
‘common sense, wisdom, and general science have more
applications.

WISDOM is important —
‘This field can be reasonably called “the engineering of
wisdom”.

COMMON SENSE is important —
This field includes the systematic study and development of
common sense.

SCIENCE is important —
This field includes what is common to all the sciences, what
is generally true and important in the sciences.

MISTAKES are costly and to be AVOIDED —
‘This field includes the systematic study of the prevention of
mistakes.

MONEY is important —
‘The systematic prevention of mistakes in your organization
might save 10 to 20% of its expenses per year.

OPPORTUNITY is important —

“Because of general dissatisfaction, 30% of the surveyed service bureau clients
planned to discontinue using service bureaus.” .

Computer Use

A recent study of 2,500 companies conducted by
the Rerearch Institute of Anerica, revealed that 55%
of the firns regularly use conputers in conducting
their business. Further breakdown of the study
shows that an everage of 32 own or lease their own
computers, and 25% use an outside service bureau for
processing data.

Wnile @ majority of the companies surveyed do use
computers in some form, a significant 45%.of the re-
spondents do not use any type of computerized data
processing service. Those companies cited the fol-
lowing reasons for not using computers:2

Total (quitiple answers) 166%

Service Bureau Use
In addition to the non-users, another recent

study revealed that most service bureau clients are
not effectively using their service bureau and, as
@ result, are receiving few, if any, of the advan-
tages of electronic: data processing (EDP). Most
of the surveyed service bureau clients were:

1, Receiving routine services which do not save
‘them money.

2. Not planning to expand into more sophisticated,
higher-payoff applications.

3. Not receiving indirect benefits and savings.
‘such as improved information for decision

king.
4, Not satisfied with current services.

The study also disclosed that because of the gen-
eral dissatisfaction, 30% of the surveyed service
bureau clients planned to discontinue using service
bureaus and purchase in-house computers.4

Cooperative Service Bureaus

Both non-users and dissatisfied service bureau
clients, therefore, offer @ ready market for a nener
approach to obtaining the advantages of EDP — the
formation of a cooperative service bureau. A coop-
erative service bureau consists of several sponsor-
ing firms who jointly own a computer and share in
its operating costs at a much lower expense than in-
dividual ownership of a computer. If carefully
planned before operations begin, 8 cooperative ser-
vice bureau will provide its sponsors with all the
advantages of EOP plus many other advantages unique
to Jointly-shared facilities and personnel.

Among these additional advantages are:

1, The sponsors would purchase a computer tai-
Jored to their specific needs.

2. They would have’ exclusive use of the computer.

3. Their computer would be available for use at
ny time.

4, They could share the costs of any computer
programs developed.

5. They could share the costs of any package or
‘eanned computer programs purchased.

6. They would have available for their exclusive
use @ staff of data processing experts and
a computer — at a fraction of the cost of
individual ownership.

Factors Insuring the Success of the Cooperative

The first step in forming a successful coopera-
tive service bureau ‘is to enroll an appropriate nun-
ber of comapnies. Ideally the cooperative should be
Limited to five or six sponsoring firms. A larger
number may create unmanageable problems involving
operations, communications, control. scheduling of
computer time, and so forth. A smaller mumber may
make the venture economically unfeasible.

: Lock of Interest

At the present time, widespread lack of interest
te Joining 8 cooperative is more of a problem to po-
{eatial organizers than too much demand. The author
festacted a number of public accounting firms about
fhe feasibility of forming cooperatives and found
{ast three firms who had already made such an at-
teap! could not interest enough firms to join, Their
comments were:

= We tried to organize one several years ago;
the firms contacted were not interested.

= We would like to explore this possibility
but we can't get anyone else interested.

= At present there appears. to be a tragic lack
‘of interest locally by other CPA firms.

Caquestionably, one reason for the lack of inter-
est fs a misunderstanding of the true nature of a
cooperative. Interested conpanies mist therefore be
prepared to sell the idea to others. As more pub-
Lsned material becomes available in the field, this
problea should be alleviated.

Confidential Information

‘A second major reason for lack of interest is
thet companies fear for the control and security of
their confidential or sensitive information. Such a
concern is certainly legitimate and underscores the
need for 2 cooperative that is to be successful, to
devise an adequate system for quality control and
security. A committee responsible for such 2 system
should be established at the outset by the sponsor-
tng firms.

Protection

Oue of its duties should be to adequately safe
guard the sponsors’ records and documents against
fire, theft, water, and other hazards and disasters.
Statistics compiled by the Safe Manufacturers Na-
181 Association show that about one-half of com:
panies whose important records and docusents were
destroyed through some catastrophe never resuned
business or were permanently closed down within six
sonths: an additional 13% suffered serious economic
tepatraent and were able to remain in business only
under severe operating handicaps.5 For this reason
the quality control and security conaittee aust se
thatthe cooperative service bureau maintains:
protective devices
Lreproof vaults
® method of reconstructing any destroyed
records
adequate insurance to cover loss of impor-
tant elient records or docunents

‘The committee must also take measures to prevent
client's records from becoming commingled with
aeother client's records — a not-unlikely occurrence

‘a such an environment.

Preventing Disclosure

Finally, the committee should determine how to
vent disclosure of confidential ipfornation. For
{2ample, no member of any sponsoring company should
be alloned in certain strategic parts of the com
evter center. Likewise, each company's records
thovld be coded and the code number known only to
y Computer center personnel. In cases requiring
Sadest security, the actual processing of data
‘ould be monitored by a key employee of the com-
Pater center or possibly by @ representative of

disinterested third party, such as a firm of inde-
pendent public accountants.

‘Sharing of Expenses: Startup Costs

With an adequate number of sponsoring firms lined
up and a sound security system worked out, the third
necessity in establishing a successful cooperative
As to determine methods of sharing the expenses.
There are two categories of costs to consider:

1, Startup costs. These include all costs incur-
red prior to the time that the cooperative commences
operations. Startup costs are either directly
traceable to a particular firm or are joint or con-
mon to all firms. An example of a direct cost would
be that of analyzing, modifying, and redesigning of

‘stems prior to conversion to the computer. An ex-
ple of a joint or common cost would be the cost of
computer housing, including air conditioning, engi-
neering supervision, false floors, ducts and pipes,
tranformers or motor generators, cabling and wiring,
and overhead racks and supports.

Each sponsoring firm should pay for its own di-
rect costs. Joint costs should be shared equally or
sportioned among the firms according to some equi-
table formula.
5 ‘Operating Costs

2. Operating costs. These include the monthly
hardware and software costs to operate the coopera-
tive. Hardware costs refer to the periodic rental
or purchase charge for the computer equipment. As a
minimum the computer equipment consists of an input
unit, a central processing unit, and an output unit.
Software costs include personnel costs, programming
costs, testing and debugging costs. magnetic tapes,
disc packs, punched cards, paper, paper tapes’, re-
pair parts, power, telecoamunication lines, and so
on.

Operating costs that are directly traceable
should be paid by the using firm. Joint or common
costs can be shared equally or can be allocated to
each firm based on the number of transactions pro-
cessed or the actual computer processing time used
during the period. In addition, if so desired, a
sponsor could be required to pay a minimum or maxi-
mum monthly charge.

Management

Fourthly, the sponséring companies should decide
how to manage the venture. It is advisable to form
@ committee to oversee the management and operation
of the cooperative. A decision must be made whether
ach menber regardless of size should have one vote
or whether another basis of voting should be used.
This decision should assure participants that no one
firm will dominate or control the cooperative.

‘Common Line of Business

A factor not to be overlooked when forming a co-
operative, one which will avoid frustrations, com-
plications, and extra expenses, is to see that each
member is in the same industry or business category.
Thus all sponsoring firms will have similar operat~
ing problems that can be simultaneously solved by
the computer personnel, resulting in the allocation
of smaller costs to each firm for each problem
solved. Also computer programs developed or pack-
aged programs purchased can be shared by all spon-
sors with minimum modifications, thus resulting in
considerable programming cost savings.

“A time-sharing installation (like every computer environment) is exposed to the seven major
dangers: fire, water, theft, fraud, sabotage, equipment malfunctions, and human errors."”

Introduction

‘This article has as its main objective to furnish
and define sone methods and provisions for control
id Security in a computer time-sharing environment.

It is evident that computer time-sharing has be-
come very popular during recent years. More and
more confidential information is being handled by
these systems, creating an urgent need for strong
measures of control and security.

Description of the System

‘The service provided by @ single conputer to many
telecommunications terminals has been called "con-

er time-sharing”. With this type of service each
sr shares simultaneously in the processing cap
bilities of the central processor. This new com
puter facility makes this service available to small
companies and/or other users who have little need
for their oxn computer,

Computing services that may go under the heading

of time-sharing include:
Commercial computing: text editing: databank
information retrieval services; application
services such as colleges’ records, inventory
control, payrolls of small companies, and ai
count receivables: administrative messages:
switching and collection services; and more.

‘Among the great nunber of time-sharing users are
hospitals (Welch Hospitel, one of the biggest in
Europe, has acquired the large ICL 19048 computer
‘with 7020 terminals), banks (Gosbank, the national
bank of the USSR, has ordered two large-scale Honey-
Well series 600 with 100 terminals), schools and
colleges (British schools and colleges have started
using terminals), airlines (Continental Airlines
uses the Sonic 360 reservation system with 550 on~
line terminals).

‘Trends

The growth in computer time-sharing hes beén phe-
nomena} in recent years in spite of a short business
ecession between 1970 and 1972, Time sharing was 2
broker's dream in the "60s; many companies realized
Ats potential, entered the market, and failed be-
cause of: one, strong competitive pressure, and two,
because of the countless thefts and violations suf
fered. The highly competitive situation benefited
the user in regard to pricing, but the offsetting
consequence of lower profits caused a high casualty
Fate among these companies, As a result, the number
of time-sharing firms dropped from 150 to 50 between
1969 and 1972,

A few of the companies which survived and which
account for most of today's time-sharing business
are Rapidata Corporation, Teletype Corporation (a
subsidiary of ATCT), Tymeshare Incorporated (the
largest independent firm and second only in size to
‘BM and Honeywell time-sharing operations), and IBY

Jerry Dreyer, executive president of ADAPSO, an
‘association of data processing service organizations
estimates that one time-sharing company out of three
was profitable in 1971, two out of five in 1972, and
probably three out of six in 1973. Nowadays, this
computer facility is coming back to its original
trend, and it is expected that the munber of con-
puters with terminals will grow from 32% at the end
of 1971 to 45% at the end of 1975, with the average
central processing unit driving 15 to 20 terminals.

One consultant, Creative Strategies of Palo Alto,
California, predicts that time-sharing sales by 1976
will increase to 2 billion from 331 million lest
year. By 1975, says ADAPSO's Dreyer, time-sharing
will account for 1/3 of the $4.5 billion computer
services industry.

Technological Advances

Most important technological advances have been
achieved recently on on-line terminals linked to
central processors, Some of the improvenents made
include solid state keyboards, which have greater
reliability and lower cost; visual display methods,
which incorporate more capacity, economy, and aes~
thetic appeal; non-impact printing techniques, which
provide faster, quieter and more reliable oper:
tions; improved lower cost memories; more powerful
logic capability: and faster and more accurate
modern techniques and improvements in central proc
essor software,

‘This is only the beginning, It is foreseen that
An the future the equipment itself will change in
nature and will probably not be recognizable as
terminals per se, Rather, terminals will be modu-
lar systems consisting of the required input/output
functions for specific jobs, built around basic con-
troller and communication interfaces: in many in-
stances, terminals will become special purpose de~
vices,

seating to Richard F, Cross, Security Office for
fank of New York. Recurity evcteme should ine

elude each of the following segments: physical se-
curity; personnel security; procedural security:
audit control; insurance; and any needed interfacing.

‘The quality and level of protection required de-
pends on the sensitivity of the data handled, Never-
theless, control and security in a time-sharing en-
vironment should encompass the whole system, since
it is well known that even the strongest control
measures can be violated at the weakest point. These
measures should be taken in the central processing
unit, software, personnel, communication lines, the
terminal, and its users.

Methods and Provisions ~
Central Processing Unit

The central processor is threatened mostly by
sabotage, fire, water, theft, EOP equipment nal-
functions, hunan accidental errors and environnen-
tal problens,

‘The computer center of any company is the heart
of the organization, and protection of the equip-
ment against these threats can be provided by a
carefully planned computer room. Luis Scoma, Presi-
dent of Data Processing Security, Inc., recommends
that the computer center be located out of the main
traffic areas, It must be fireproof, dustfree, and
waterproof and provided with temperature and humid
ity control and carbon dioxide fire extinguishers.
Water Mines should not run through the computer
room. & separate, fireproof storage area should be
provided for data files, documentation, and oper-
ating supplies. It should also have alarm devices
sensitive to magnetism, humidity, heat, pressure,
dust, theft, power blackout, etc, There should be
strong access control including armed guards
fenced areas, TV monitors, personnel identification
(visual, voice print, fingerprint, badge, passwords,
ete.), well-performed maintenance service, and a
number of extra provisions for protection,

Date Processing Security, Inc. has developed,, for
high security necessities, an electronically oper-
ated double door entry systen for access control in-
to the conputer room, When a person enters the buf-
fer zone, the door locks behind him while he is sub-
Jected to electronic search. If something is de-
tected, the system freezes and automatically alerts
the security guard. The second door can be opened
only with @ special badge key.

A carbon dioxide (COp) fire extinguishing system,
such as the one installed at the Chase Manhattan
Bank's New York City headquarters, has proved use-
ful, Engineered by Wolter Kidde & Co.. Inc., this
system uses a battery of remotely located cylinders
containing the liquid gas. When activated by smoke
detectors, the gas discharges and builds up an in-
ert atmosphere in the imediately surrounding area,
extinguishing the fire without damaging equipment or
date files. Employees can go back to work within
five minutes after the fire has been put out and the
ventilation systems restarted.

Another fire-fighting system which has been de-
veloped by the Ansul Company uses Halon extinguish-
ing agents which are discharged in the form of a
colorless, odorless, and non-toxic gas. “Since Halon
agents do not work by diluting oxygen, they are
well-suited for areas. where humans are present.

‘The Guaranty Bank and Trust Co, of Worcester,
Mass., has adopted another approach to fire-fighting.
a system installed by Security Control Systems which
detects fire, smoke and excessive temperatures and
humidity fluctuations and causes @ monitoring and

Software

Protection of data files, whether in the form of
punch cards, magnetic tapes, or discs, is the key
element in any conputer facility.

Sone specific examples of software security con-
trol measures are audit trails, access regulations,
strong supervision of computer operators, the use
and control of prograns utilizing program docunen-
tation methods, the use of a log for all significant
events (such as user identification, file use and
attempts of unauthorized use), reguistions to pre-
vent unauthorized personne! from browsing through
the files, and the use of a semi-automatic data in-
ventory control system.

= Personne!
Physical control as to who is allowed near the
computer and the files is advisable. Note that this
does not mean "employees only"; it implies 2 careful
sereening of employees, repairmen, and visitors to
determine which of them should be allowed this prox-
imity to the system, Intimately involved with time~
sharing installations are three types of personnel
operators, programmers, and maintenance engineers.

According to Vennis Van Tassel, mathematician and
head programmer at San Jose State College, all oper-
ators must understand that there exists 2 protection
philosophy: If personnel are expected to help en-
force and io comply with this protection philosophy,
it must be clearly defined and specified.

It is advisable to use the following provisions
for personnel control: contro! of logs and monitor,
division of responsibilities, rotation of duties,
adequate supervision to reduce the risk of losses
eaused by accident or error, careful handling of
data files, cleanliness regulations, control access
to private files, and appropriate instruction in
case of disasters.

Terminals

Some of the most conmon pitfalls encountered
when using terminals are frequent communication in-
terruptions, risk of communication interception,
difficult access control, and noisy lines.

Among the greatest disadvantages of time-sharing
services are those in connection with the communi-
cation lines which link the terminals to the central
Processing unit. Telephone lines are designed for
voice communication rather than data communication,
and the results have been that such lines are too
noisy and have too many interruptions for appropri-
ate handling of data communication.

There have been some recent developents in the
improvement of data transmissions, Bell System has
developed its Digital Data Service (DDS), 2 date
transmission system which has been introduced early
this year in five cities (New York, Boston, Phila~
delphia, Kashington, and Chicago); and, by the end
of 1974, twenty-four cities are expected to have it,
Bell further plans to provide continuous monitoring
of their DDS channels, When errors of transmission
fare detected, DDS will notify the customer. Deci-
sion on retransmission will be the customer's re-
sponsibility. Another development in data communi-
cation is DUV (data under voice). By late 1973 this
technique will be in service between New York and
Chicago; consequently, communication problems should

become virtually nonexistent within the near future,
and this system will becone even more popular.

Telephone lines are vulnerable to three types of
security problems: wire tapping. piggyback, and
user's sign-off signa] cancellation. These common
threats may be avoided by the use of a privacy
transformation method (also called scranblers or
cryptographic techniques), This is @ non-singular
(reversible) operation which conceals the original
message either by the substitution of new characters,
rearrangement of the characters, or by the adding of
strings of digits to the original message.

Some new techniques for encrypting data have
evolved, such as high speed transmission and signal
scrambling, In spite of all of these new tech~
niques, it is still possible to intercept and tap
the information. According to Tuckerman, unauthor-
ized users (intruders) who possess only limited ma~
terial and information with which to work, can read-
ily extract the original text of enciphered mes-
sages by making use of the speed, capacity, and
computational abilities of the computer.

The greater the efficiency of the privacy trans-
formation, the more difficult it becomes for unauth-
orized copying of files,

‘Access Control

Access to the system throughout the communication
Lines should be controlled by the central processing
unit and by the user's own procedures, This is pos-
sible by cryptographic and scramble techniques, per-
sonnel regulations, user identification, appropriate
terminal location, or by ciphering and deciphering
hardware. C

Computer software packages have been written to
cipher data transmissions. Ciphering software is
an attractive technique because it can be done auto~
matically by the program which creates the data and
at a very low cost, Only programs using the match
ing deciphering technique are able to use this data.
These special hardware cipher devices can be located
at the terminal-and at the computer to protect
transmitted dati

Scranblers or voice privacy devices are currently
being used by people who readily acknowledge the in-
Security of transmitted information, Scramblers are
used by large corporations such as the oil industry
as well as by union representatives during contract
negotiation time. (Scramble phones are currently a
20 to 30 million-dollar business, excluding law en-
forcement and military purchases). Scramble devices
are now being built for time-sharing operations.
These devices offer protection similar to encryption.
Scramblers convert data into something resembling
channel noise or a malfunctioning circuit.

Other features for terminals include print in-
Mbit, security keylock, operator identification
card reader, and the use of @ terminal identifier.
With print inhibit the terminal operator can enter
data, such as security passwords, without its being
physically displayed. A physical keylock can be at-
tached to the terminal which will not aldow the
entry of data, The operator identification card
Feader reads magnetically encoded information on
magnetic strip card. The card can be used to supply
the user's password and/or name,

Direct access device security features include

Procedure for Withdrawal
Sixth, a procedure should be established for
withdrawal from the cooperative. If the withdran-
ing firm has not been a member for a predetermined
time, perhaps one or two years, 2 sliding scale
penalty fee for withdrawal should be established.

Procedure for Admission -

Finally, procedures aust be determined to govern
the admission of new menbers into the cooperstive.
Perhaps @ unaninous affirmative vote by current nem-
bers should be required to admit a new menber. The
current menbers should also decide if @ newly adnit-
ted menber should be required to pay @ predetermined
portion of the cooperative's startup costs and if
‘the cooperative should limit membership to firms of
the same approxinate size as current members.

Conclusion

With due care taken in following the above steps.
establishing a successful cooperative service bureau
should be relatively easy. Companies would be well

advised to consider the idea seriously, for cooper-

ative service bureaus offera viable and inmany ways su-
erior alternative to the nore costly inhouse computer
nd the less satisfactory outside service bureau.

“Systems analysts... must be seen as full-fledged members of the firm.”

‘A Wall of Managerial Attitudes

In most large organizations, the systems and data
‘processing departments are separated from the rest

if the firm by a wall of managerial attitudes. While
employees in most jobs are encouraged to gain a wide
variety of experience in various departments as they
rise through various managenent levels, it is rare
that @ systens analyst or a programmer is given an
equal opportunity. The general attitude is "He's a
computer man, not a manager (or a businessman, or a
banker). He wouldn't fit in. Besides, he's doing a
good job where he is."

As a result, the analyst has exactly no motiva-
tion to think of himself as an insurance man or a
businessman, or a banker, or an accountant. He is
made to feel like @ consultant. He can serve the
organization, but he isn't free to move within it.
To make matters worse, sone firms rotate the people
in their management development prograns through
stint in the systems department. It is little won-
der that there is 9 high turnover in systens ana-
lysts. The company does very little to make hia
feel itke  menber of the fanily.

Potential Source of Talent

But beyond the problens brought about by the per-
sonnel turbulence, the firm is ignoring a potential
source of fine managerial talent. Many analysts
Joining major corporations hold degrees as Master.
Business Administration. Their educational back-
Grounds, when combined with their ability to objec~
tively define problens and see solutions, and the
detailed working knowledge of the company gained in

the system design process, should put them in the
management spotlight. Instead, the system analyst
finds that he has been given the indelible label of
“computer person” and that his upward mobility is
Limited to the systems department. As a result,
systens analysts leave the firm, and often leave the
systens profession.

If companies hope to attract and hold talented
personnel for their systems activities, they need
to offer then an equal chance to develop to their
full potential. They must be seen as full-fledged

bers of the firm — not as consultants who are
here today, but who could move on tomorrow.

Experience in Systems

As businesses come more and more to depend upon
data processing to support their operations, it
will be desirable for a significant number of man-
agenent team menbers to have experience in systems.
Yet, by their actions, managenents have forced many
talented people to avoid beginning their careers in
data processing for fear of becoming stereotyped.

So it would seem that a number of the problens
that businesses face in their systems activities are
a result of a regrettable but widesprgad management
attitude.

Only when systems analysts are regarded as having
a potential for advancement to positions in general

agement, and are given an equal chance to rise in
the organization, will the systems man lose his al-
Senation and see himself as a member of the company

Action on World Trade

“What we [the United States} have is 2 little corner of the world, and we must find @
wey to live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of whom are every bit as
good as we are at almost everything we do.”

‘The thene of ay remarks is the intensifying con
troversy over the conditions that influence our
well-being here in the United States — particularly
the threat of another unfortunate experience with
protectionism.

I an well aware that I cannot go deeply into this
subject in a short space. This I know because I was
Privileged to serve on the President's Commission on
International Trade and Investment Policy. For over
‘a year we studied every way in which this and other
countries are affected by international trade and
investment policies.

Protactionist Attitude

«Let there be no doubt where I stand on the prin-
cipal issue. I believe that the threat of the protec-
Uonist attitude in America is far more than an is-

e involving business and jobs. I sincerely be-
lieve that this issue embraces many powerful forces
‘that will have an important bearing on whether or
not all the peoples of the world make the most of
their opportunities in the years to cone.

I recognize that there are strong and honest dif-
ferences of opinion on the proper direction of our

tion's foreign trade policies. There are many
‘sons and suppliers who have been adversely af.
fected by foreign competition. It would be unreal-
Astic not to acknowledge this fact of life.

Complexity

‘These differences of opinion, and these disloca-
‘tions of people's lives, point up the complexities
of the problem. Who among us can honestly say he
understands ali of the ramifications involved in the
balance of trade? Where is there an unchallenged
expert on monetary policy? What type of restraints,
if any, could or should be made on the world-wide
transfer of technology? What is the proper level

porting broad research and development to match the
funds that foreign countries are investing in their
industry? Can we preserve the rise in productivity
that underlies the American miracle — which is the
production of goods at low cost while wages, taxes
and dividends all rise steadily?

‘These are just sone of the questions which must
be asked in the discussion now developing, particu-
larly in the halls of Congress, but also at various
other governnental and community. levels.

Pacing these and still other complexities, we
know that Congressional hearings soon to begin
could result in new laws and regulations which
could be detrimental.

with a qualified viewpoint backed by experience, to
be simply an observer. I am convinced that this
present controversy can be resolved positively, but
it will require action.

What kind of action will be most effective? the
kind of action which is in the public interest? —
not special pleadings based on the experience of a
Single company, or @ single industry, oF even a
single community.

It is, of course, important to gather this sup~
porting information and be aware of all the facts
‘that bear on our needs, our experience and the op-
tions that governments can take to effect then. But
going beyond this, we must be prepared to discuss
with everyone who will exert influence on ourelected
lawmakers the more important question — what do all
these statistics and contentions mean to, me?

‘The Concerns of U.S. Citizens

‘The concerns of the great body of United States
citizens are how to assure and enhance their jobs
and living conditions and be involved in what was
once unashamedly described as "the pursuit of hap-



Let's look at just one major concern: about 1.3
million new Anerican families are formed every year.
‘Approximately eight million people change their jobs
every year. About 3.7 million people join the labor
force and 2.1 million leave it. By 1980 full en-
ployment in the United States will require jobs for
100 million people, 18 million more than were en-
ployed ot the end of 1972. These, quite clearly,
fare the priority considerations in the minds of mil-
Lions who do not clearly understand how the enter-
prise system meets their needs.

If they and the representatives of large numbers
of voters do not understand, how can we expect their
support?

I would like to review the arguments for their
support in as familiar terms’as I can muster.

~ ‘The Days of U.S. Preeminence are Gone

First, let's examine one portion of the real
economic world we inhabit.

Of primary importance is the fact that the days
of almost total U.S. preeminence since the close of
World War IT are gone.

We must learn to live and work in a world where
forevermore we will be dependent on other portions
of the globe for some of our more basic needs — and
some portions will be dependent on us. The U.S. is
not self-sufficient in materials, nor does it have 2
corner on the world’s technology, the world's inno-
vative ability, the world's marketing savvy, the
world's production know-how. What we have is @ lit-
tle corner of the world, and we must find a way to
live in it harmoniously with our neighbors, many of
whom are every bit as good as we are at almost
everything we do.

‘The Energy Crisis
I hesitate, somewhat, to use the energy erisis as
an example of this dependency, because I recognize
that there are those who question whether the crisis
ly exists, or who maintain that new technology
will solve the problem before it reaches crisis
stage. I can say at this point that there is an
energy shortage, if not a crisis; for example, the
fuel oil allotment for our Minneapolis operations
has been cut by 25 per cent for January and February,
and similar cutbacks have been imposed on other con
Penies, our schools, our common carriers.

Let's look at the dependency which fs developing
im the ofl industry. In the past, the repatriated
earnings of oi1 companies have exceeded the value of
imported oi] and were a favorable factor in our in-
ternational balance of payments. By 1985, however,
our needs for oi1 and natural gas could create for
Us a trade deficit approaching twenty billion dol-
lars a year.

‘As no doubt you know, we currently import I0 to
1S per cent of both erude oi1 and copper, 30 per
cent of our iron ore. and more than 80 per cent of
our bauxite needs. -We must import all or most of
our tin, natural rubber, nickel and chrome.

‘Trade with the World

We cannot go it alone. We must trade with the
world — and to trade, you give something to get
Something, with the hope that both traders get what
‘they want and need. Unfortunately, we have not yet
been able to fully realize this goal, and much of

the controversy over this nation's foreign-trade
policies revolves around the best way to achieve it.

‘There is a strong and vocal body of opinion which
believes that protectionist measures will achieve
what is best for American workers and companies in
the arena of world trade. One of their principal
targets are companies like Honeywell — aultini
tional companies with substantial investments, em-
ployees and sales outside the United States.

“Exporting Jobs"?

It is claimed that U.S, multinational corpora.
tions are “exporting jobs” overseas; that U.S. com-
panies invest overseas to take advantage of loner
wages: that imports from the overseas subsidiaries
of U.S. companies cause unemployment here at hom
that if U.S. companies were prevented from investing
and manufacturing abroad these companies would be
forced to expand their operations in the United
States, creating more jobs here: that multinational
companies invest abroad in order to avoid paying
taxes; that American corporations are exporting U.S.
technology and therefore are helping non-U.S. com
Panies compete in our own and other countries.

‘The Burke-Hartke bill has been proposed as the
Solution to these problens; and protectionist senti-
ment also underlies other proposals which may energe
for the consideration of Congress.

At this point, there may be those who will accuse
me of making a tactical blunder by even mentioning
the allegations of our critics. But I'll go one
step further. If someone could prove to me that
these allegations are factual, I'd be one of the
major supporters of moves to inhibit the growth of
aultinational companies.

‘The Opposite is True: Making Jobs

Thanks to various companies, government agencies
and trade associations who have accumulated the
facts and published then, I know otherwise.

I am convinced, thanks to these studies, and my
experience with Honeywell, that multinational con-
panies-do not export jobs, but create jobs in the
United States faster than other U.S. companies. I
am convinced that U.S. companies invest abroad to
gain participation in markets in other countries.
hot to take advantage of lower wages or so-called
tax loopholes. I am convinced by these studies that
imports from the overseas subsidiaries of U.S. con-
panies have not been a major factor in U.S. unen-
ployment.

To be more specific, I'd like to give you sone
information taken fron’a survey conducted by the
Energency Committee on American Trade, of which I
ana menber. This committee researched the domestic
and international operations of 74 U.S. corporations
representing a broad group of large suitinational
corporations. This survey reveals that in the
years between 1960 and 1970, when these companies
Were increasing their overseas operations. they also
provided 900,000 new Jobs in the United Siates. They
also increased their sales from Anerigan facilities
<= work performed in this country — fron $58 bil-
Lion to $113 billion — nearly doubled, in fact.
Their, exports from the United States nearly tripled
in this period, rising fron $4.3 billion to $12.2
billion. In the all-important balance of payments
category, they increased their net surplus of ex-
Ports over imports from $3.2 billion to $6.6 billion
more than doubled,

international Investment Activit
‘of Multinational Companis

‘These figures, and other results of the survey,
lead to one major conclusion: That the interna-
tional investment activities of these representative
multinational companies played an important role in
their rapid export growth and consequently made a
major positive contribution to their domestic — and
emphasize the word domestic — sales, investment
‘and employment growth.

Double Taxation

I have tried to speak in familiar language: so I
have sone misgivings about discussing the issue of
taxes. But the tax issue is an important one, and
I'd Like to cover sone specific areas which are con-
ing more and more into public ’discussion.

=

‘E issue is the section of U.S. tax law which al-
Jows American corporations a tax credit for the in-
come taxes they pay to foreign countries on income
earned in such countries. The purpose of this tax
credit is to avoid taxing the foreign earnings of
U.S. corporations twice — once in a foreign country
and again when the earnings are remitted to the
United States.

Opponents of this tax credit argue that since do-
westic firms are not allowed a federal tax credit
for the state taxes they pay, the current method of
taxing income from foreign sources is inconsistent
with the way domestic income is taxed.

‘Texation by U.S. States

A major fallacy in this argument is that it is
based on the incorrect assumption that the taxation
of domestic incone by city, state and the federal
Government is analogous to the United States taxing
the foreign earnings of Anerican subsidiaries which
have already been taxed by the host country.

The proper analogy is between the nay states
treat corporate income earned in two or more states
and the way the U.S. government treats income earned
in two or more countries. Every state which has a
state income tax provides a method of allocating the
income of a multi-state conpany among the various
states in order to avoid duplicate taxation of the
same incone. As a matter of fact, the constitution
requires this. Thus the current methods of taxing
foreign and domestic incone are consistent.

Further, where one domestic corporation in the
United States has an ownership position in another
domestic corporation, the federal income tax law
quite properly prevents duplication of corporate in-
come taxes. The parent company is taxed on earnings
of the owned company only when such earnings are
distributed as a dividend — and then at no more
than @ noninal rate. What logic can there be in the
Burke-Hartke proposal that earnings of an overseas
subsidiary — in most cases earnings already taxed
in the foreign country at rates comparable to or
higher than U.S. rates — should be inmediately re-
taxed at full U.S. income tax rates?

International Competition by
American industry

Another fundamental element of the issue is the

tax credit's relationship to the ability of American
industry to compete internationally. According to
Fecent survey by the National Association of Manufac-
turers, if the United States were to repeal the tax

eredit for foreign taxes paid and tax all foreign
Subsidiary incone before it is paid out in dividends
to the parent company, U.S, firms with foreign oper-
ations would be forced to pay an average effective
tax on their foreign earnings of over 70 per cent.

Given this added tax handicap, few American firms
could continue to compete with foreign-controlled
companies for world markets.

You can appreciate how useful it is to have these
facts for presentation where ‘contradictory allega-
tons are being made. Let's keep the record straight!

Also useful to the undertaking on which we must
all embark is the factual story of what imports and
exports do, beneficially to create jobs.

Imports Produce One Million U.S. Jobs

Labor Department figures document the finding
that one million jobs in the United States are de-
Pendent on imports — jobs for food processors, ship
and dock workers, truck drivers and railroader:
warehouse employees and retail clerks. And it's
equally impressive to consider that every billion
dollars worth of exports creates 60-to-80,000 jobs
in the United States. 5

As we assess the situation, let us not forget the
dilemma our government faced in August 1971. as

Mr. Peter Peterson wrote, the New Economic Policy
announced that month was not, and I quote, "a one-
shot reaction to a one-time crisis. It marked the
beginning of a new era of more flexible, enduring.
and viable economic reletionships among nations. The
years behind us were by and large an era of success,
but an era based upon a system which had becone out-
grown, outworn — and increasingly erisis-prone.”

Toriffs and Free Trade

Mr. Peterson was referring to the tremendous in-
pact that international trade and monetary factors
were having on our people. We have since come to
learn the difficulty of achieving universally ap-
proved corrective action. And now we aust reckon
with this reality: U.S. negotiators are preparing
to enter economic talks next fall that could shape
future international relationships for many years to
cone. Our government can and should strive in these
talks to put an end to present attitudes and trends
that point ominously to another "balkanization” of
world trade.

It can and should seek agreement to reduce, and
if possible end, all tariffs on industrial trade by
the end of this century.

It can and should try to create far freer trade
conditions for farm products.

It can and should seek the harmonization among
nations of the present hodgepodge of non-tariff
trade barriers and preferences.

But these objectives will remain forlorn hopes
unless our negotiators can go into these hard bar-
gaining sessions with the clear backing of the Aner-
ean people and their Congress. Re must give thea
that.

The Search Beyond Manipulation

“Computer arts are still in the highly experimental stage of emergence.”

In present computer art, the naive onlooker could
readily misconstrue that mathematical processing of
data and manipulation of design represent the total
modus operandi of this new form, rather than just
the initial phases of exploration. A review of the
varied conputer arts reveals diverse input of pat-
terns and subsequent manipulation or transformation,
creating a series of new, perceptual audio or visual
images. There appears a similarity of approaches
and sone variation of the techniques utilized by
practitioners of the cybernetic arts: graphics,
sculpture, film, dance, music, textile design, weav-
ing, poetry, and architecture.

There is a tendency to forget that the computer
arts are still in the highly experimental stages of
emergence, and although some attractive and very
Pleasing works have been accomplished, this new me-
dium has generally not progressed much beyond its
mathematical and scientific origins. At times, in
Viewing or hearing the output of the computer arts,
fone would relegate the resultant art form to the
category of interesting sound or visual pattern
experinental/initial exercises, or mathematical and
scientific visualization, rather than as works of
art per se. (This latter statement is equally true
of contemporary manual experimental art.) There is,
at the present time, a tendency for the computer

‘ts to relate to an elite coterie, made up of
Scientists and intellectuals, rather than the public
at large. However, as this new art medium is given
Greater space in the mass media, this audience
should enlarge greatly, as exposure acquaints the

Pattern Manipulation

Manipulation of design by ‘the computer may be de-
Liberate, (or at times highly experimental) as
change oF transformation of the original pattern is
achieved via # host of techniques developed within
the past twelve years. However, in attempting to
see precedent in manipulation of design, one ob-
serves ample evidence of a growing interest by ar-
Lists and critics in combining (manually) mathenat—
ies and art. Since the turn of the century, such
techniques and philosophy have been practiced and
‘even more verbally expressed by electronic and con-
crete musicians. Further, the concept of pattern
yanipulation is as old as man's art, and one finds
ample evidence of this concept throughout art his-
tory. A few such examples are: Offset X/Y patterns
in Persian sculptural reliefs: repetitions of design
in serial imagery fron early Greek vases: reversals
of pattern in the compositions of Bach: mirror in-
ages and mathenatical progressions of design in the
Foundation Course exercises of the Bauhaus School ;
Juxtaposition and superposition of musical patterns
throughout musical history; and randomization of
musical variations vie throwing of dice, as prac-
ticed by Mozart. The world was quite ready phi lo-
sophically and mathenatically for further explor
tions im such transformation of pattern, yet it was
not until the speed of the computer afforded this
electronic manipulation, that it becane feasible to
such a degree. (Alteration, change, and transforma-
tion of pattern is revealed in other technological
systems that may or may not use the computer as an aid in
creation: synthesized video, sound, and the film.) In
other words, science and technology now afford fur-
ther exploration of ideas and techniques that have
been practiced by experinental artists for years.

The philosophy and practice of twentieth century
music shows a very great similarity between the ma
nipulative techniques used by musicians since the
early 1900's and the present-day computer procedures.
Examination of the philosophy of the Bauhaus and
study of the works emanating from this revolutionary
school, also reveals great similarities in the ap-
proaches to creation, and in the final works of art
of this school and present-day computer arts.

‘The ‘computer artist {s manipulating patterns, be-

Design State Varistion

This is @ term devised by the writer. adapted
fron given “state” variations used in printmaking,
in which one may revise a plate or stone, and al-
ter it by additions and/or changes of pattern, re-
sulting ina series of new works. The term denotes
known variations of pattern that are possible, which
ay be used as sub-routines or stored on the com~
puter library and merely called by the user, who de-
fines the values of the given parameters of ‘the spe
cific algorithms being utilized. One of the most
Provocative concepts energing in conputer art is
that of being to literally predict innumerable de-
sign state varistions, in which a basal component
will be visually or auditorially pleasing. The art-
ist may use only those design states that reflect
personal expression of design. (One might compare
design state variations to the meny kinds of chisels
the Sculptor may use in execution of a work of art,
each giving unique effects.) Further, this library
ef manipulative design state variations is constantly
being enlarged by experimenters in the computer
arts. A brief listing follows:
‘Offsets of pattern on the X. ¥. X/Y (pro-
gressions in music)
Mirror images or reversals on the X, Y. X/Y
Scalar variations or duration of pattern in

Rotation, in open or closed forns

Prior to design state variation, the artistic
idea is stated in coherent, sequential steps. It may
be flow-charted before translation into a computer
program. Thus the art idea is transformed into ana-
lyzed date, using synthetic machine languages, and
4s then subject to processing and manipulation via
‘the computer using design state variations, reveal-
ing innumerable new, final works. Examples include:

‘The warp and weft patterns in weaving

Classical ballet positions, with designations
of the head, arms, and feet

Structural modules in sculpture and archi-
tecture

Derivations of design from art or musical
history, including the archaic, the classi-
eal, or the contemporary

Formulae and transformations from science or
mathematics

Stylistic analysis of a given artist's style,
with designation and statenent of a speci-
fic set of definitions describing the style

Artistic composition of a given musical era,
with parameters of such rules

Thus the art idea is initially expressed in the
manner of science, but it does not end there. The
choice of the art idea or problem should express the
personal philosophy of the originator, whether it is
mathematical formulae, natural derivations from the
environment, or analyses of prior styles of artists.
The personal focus of the original idea, ensuing
variation and execution cannot be too strongly
stressed! The design state variations allow the
artist to choose the given direction of psychic ex-
pression. Further, selection of specific computer
systems and ert materials affords @ highly individ-
val element within cybernetic creation. And tastly,
the varying techniques of execution, which may be
preplanned or participant, add a unique and personal
opportunity to spontaneously participate within the
formation of the work of art, or to maximize the ca
pacities of the computer in artistic execution, ui
ing preplanned or heuristic modes

Diverse Philosophies of Computer Art

Stylistic analysis and resultant design deriva-
tion are highly visible in the computer arts and
possess decided benefits: these techniques allow one
to analyze more thoroughly the subject under study,
and in addition, they allow the artist to gain per-
ceptual variations and permutations of the original
Source not obtainable by manual methods. (The writer
‘and many others have often found these new departures
from the design source to be as or more aesthetic
than the original input source.) There is, however,
a great tendency anong humanists to concern then-
selves with past styles and subject matter, as being
more "pure" aesthetically than the present. On the
other hand, there is an equal tendency among scien-
tists to exploit matheaatical manipulation, disre-
rd art totally, and to have the conputer and its
periphersl devices accomplish the work of art, with~
out intervention by man. Here one finds two ex-
tremes. with beginning dogmatic statements by art-
ists of varying capacities and philosophies. The in-
sightful conputer artist, however, seeks fo unite
personal philosophy and expression with the highest
level of computer usage.in a statement of artistic
unity. However, one is conscious of new visions
emerging throughout history, which are subsequently
categorized and "cast in bronze.” as “the way.” Con-
puter art appears to be mo exception to this great

“in science fiction writing, non-specialists attempt to involve other non-specialists in
the human questions arising from computer use."*

In "The Computer and the Poet.” Norman Cousins
eaphasizes that the role of poets. “those who have
Fespect for and speak to the husan spirit,” becomes
even more inportant as conputer usage increases (32).
Science fiction writers should indeed be included as
poets in our technological age. All too often in
Gur society, problens arising from technology are
left to technologists because others are too unsure
of their own knowledge to question or criticize. The
science fiction writings directly involving conput-
ers are one of the few places where non-specialists
attempt to involve other non-specialists in the
human questions arising from computer use.

7 Emphasis on Man

Perhaps the most recurrent science fiction thene
is the difference between computers and man. These
False the question of the proper role for machines
versus the proper role for hunans or emphasize the
aspects that make man unique. In one story (Asimov,
Someday") children in a society where reading and
writing are no longer needed form a secret society
to learn just for the joy of it; in another (Weir,
“what Happened to the Teaching Machine") where all
learning is by machine, only uneducated children

411 know how to pose questions. A super-computer
4s defeated by 2 hunan because he can bluff or "lose
to win” and it cannot (Caiden, The God Machine)

other super-computer is robbed of its control be-
cause of a group of humans whose main desire is
freedon (Pohl, Starchild); and to others (Dick, “The
Variable Man"; Sheckley, "Fool's Mate") human unpre-
dictability continues to be a problem. This distinc-
tive aspect of man is very directly stated by the
computer builder in 9 French science fiction story
(Boulie, "The Perfect Robot"), In trying to aake
the coaputer more like man, he progressively adds to
its ability to deal with data, the ability to play
chess, language, concepts of love, the ability to
engender new machines, concepts of good and evil,

1d finally what he considers to be the crucial
missing element — "I have unhinged then”. Mike, o
‘super-computer capable of running an entire revolu-
tion (Heinlein, The Noon is a Harsh Mistress), can-
Bot understand why @ joke 15 funny, and the computer

AM (Ellison, “I Have No Mouth and I Must Serean")
hates people because unlike them "he could not wan-
der, he could not wonder, he could not belong. he
could merely be".

Science fiction writers persist in confronting
their readers with a question that receives little
direct discussion but is of current concerr. As ex-
pressed by the historian Bruce Mazelish (33), just
as continuities were established with the material
universe, the animal kingdom, and our, subconscious,
we are faced with transcending the 4th discontinuity
— of harmonizing our existence and those of mach-
ines in a technological society. Or, as expressed
by Weizenbaum ("On the Impact of the Conputer on So-
efety") the insights of science such as those pro-
vided earlier by the work of Galileo, Darwin, and
Freud, and now provoked by the adveni of the com-
puter, shake man's self-esteem because, when viewed
superficially, they seem to diminish man.

Mechanistic View of Man

We diminish man and in our anxiety grow more dis-
dainful of ourselves and ambivalent towards conput-
ers if computer usage is predicated on a mechanistic
view of man and this mechanistic view becones our
self-image. Too many statements made by systens
lysts or conputer scientists display that @ com-
puter-usable view of man is being substituted for
the whole man. Keep in mind the above list of human
attributes contrasted to computers by science-fic-
tion writers as you read the following statement
from the widely read and much discussed book Limit
of Growth written by well-motivated systems analyst

Some considered the model too ‘technocratic’
observing that it did not include eritical so-
cial factors, such as the effects of adoption
of different value systems. The chairman of
the Moscow meeting sunned up this point when
he said, ‘Man is no mere biocybernetic device’.
This criticism is readily admitted. The pres-
nt model considers man only in his material
system because valid social elements simply



13-00000

could not be devised and introduced in this

* first effort. Yet, despite the model's mater-
fel orientation, the conclusions of the study
point to the need for fundamental changes in
‘the values of society. (34, p. 191)

Admission that the world model has a minor flaw of
omitting “critical social factors" followed so
blithely by conclusions about fundamental value
changes surely conveys to the reader that the fac~
tors that have been dealt with are the more essen-
tial and more significant.

‘Again recall the human attributes as you read:

‘That the theories

+ + are mechanistic — that they postulate
only the processes capable of being effected
by mechanisn — is guaranteed by simulating
the behavior predicated by ordinary digital
computers. (ibid. p. 258)

To reenphasize the contribution of science fic-
tion, let us trace through one well-written and pop-
ular’ book, Stand on Zanzibar (Brunner). In the 21st
century over-popalated world, there is a very ad-
vanced computer Shalmaneser owned by General Tech-
ie, @ company large enough to be contemplating the
subsidization, modernization, and management of a
small underdeveloped country Beninia. Beninia is
unique since it alone has retained peacefulness and
trust and hunane behavior. Conputer analysis is un-
dertaken of the feasibility of the G.T. project and
for alternative plans of carrying it out. With re-
gerd to the possibility of computer analysis of what
uekes Beninia attractive, one sensitive character in
the book says" when they get love down to a
bunch of factors you can analyze with a computer,
there'll be nothing left of whatever makes it worth
being human”. Shalmeneser eventually rejects the
data on Beninia because it is inconsistant with re-
ality. Mulligan, a cynical sociologist, gets the
computer to process the date by adding the additional
Assumption that an unknown force is active in that
Population. Mulligan points out that the scientists
who have been working toward consciousness for the
Supercomputer have been successful because the re-
Section of the data was a display of its first hunan
Characteristic — “orneriness” or "bloody-minded-
ness”. When faced with sonething different, it chose
‘to reject it instead of broadening its view of the
possible. Mulligan sets out to find what makes
Beninia different and traces it to a genetic muti
tion which produces a body odour that surpresses in
Others the territorial-aggression reaction. Mulli-
Gan's hope is that a world-renowned biologist who is
Working on modification of human genetic maps can
better mankind. His hope is shattered
rns that this biologist has been murdered
for political reasons. The decision is that the me-
chine will work on finding an external synthetic
spray, Mulligan {s led away crying for lost hunan-
Aty *"... what in God's name is it worth to be hu-
My if we have to be saved fron ourselves by a ma
chine?” The now conscious machine has the last word
id the last sentence of the book “Christ. what an
Amagination I've got". The irony of the book is
that Mulligan, who represents and speaks for those

characteristics which are human, falls into another
part of the prevalent mechanistic trap — aggression
is in our genes; the solution to our problems will
be via a specific scientific breakthrough.

\d government is seen in numerous stories. Opin-
ion polling in a political campaign is involved in
‘The 490 (Burdick), and the writing of campaign lit-
erature in The Novel Conputer (Escarpit). The pre-
diction of elections is carried to an extrene in
“Franchise” (Asimov) where only one vote is needed
to determine the election, and Counterfeit World
(GGalouye) describes an entire synthetic society (an
"electronathenatical model") made up for purposes of
opinion surveying. Of greater concern, however, are
‘the super-states dependent on or replaced by super-
computer systens. Many of these stories describe
the process by which men gradually gave away self-
determination in exchange for materiel well-being,
or in the belief that a larger something was needed
to protect then from each other (Anderson, “San
Hall"; Cole, The Funco File; Dick, Vulcan's Hamner;
Fairman, 1, the ne; Mason, Matrix; Pohl, Star
ghild).' Often, no one really understands any longer
how the system works (Cameron, Cybernia; Cole, The

Funco File: Delany, The Fall of the Towers: Dick,
Vul Hanmer; Fairman, I, the Vachine; Mason,

Watrix). In most cases, the vast destructive power
Of the system is realized when, for sone reason, it
longer serving human énds. One computer over-

sizes the goal of protecting itself (Dick, Vul-
Hamner), one gets carried axay by its goal of

joiding therno-nuclear war (Cardin, The God Ma
ghine), two become lonely and hence mad (Fairman. 1,
‘the Hachine; Pohl, Starchild), another becomes psy~
thotic because of what it leatns fron men's minds
(Delany, The Fall of the Toners), others are under
the control of selfish people (Cameron, Cybernia:
Sladek, The Reproductive Svsten). Most of these
systeas are destroyed by man's more flexible intel-
Ligence. However, in one story (Miller, "Dumb
Waiter"), the system goes on even efter there are no
more people, and in snother (Dick, “Autofac"), with-
‘out the knowledge of the people.

Loss of Controt

Some ten years ago when discussing views of com-
puters in science fiction, I pointed out that few
contemporary stories could be viewed sinply as man's
worries about his machines getting beyond his con-
trol. I noted that most of the stories focused on
extensions of specific current uses and enphasized
fan's responsibilities as technology advanced (30,
31). While there are sone stories in which comput-
ers turn on their makers (Onieprov, “Siema"), the
stories Just cited have two significantly different
characteristics. The stories do not begin with the
construction of a machine motivated by curiosity oF
scientific naivetée, but instead, they begin with
the populace agreeing to control by the machine. We
read, for exanple, that in 1993 after a large world
war, all nations agree to “subordinate themselves in
@ realistic manner... to a coamon supranational
authority ..." which is a machine so that it won't
put “interest over reason, emotion over logic”
(Dick, Vulcan's Hanmer p. 19); or that another mach-
ine 4s Built to control the world because with stone
faxes men could be free es they could do only Linited
damage before they were stopped but with advanced
technology men could do danage 0 much more quickly
they cannot be free to start (Pohl, Starchild).. In
A Tale of the Big Conputer (Johannesson), a history
of life until the “computer age,” we learn that man

4s @ part of the evolution leading up to computers

“and that the basic cause of his failure was the in-

ability to organize a complex society. In the very
enjoyable Funco File (Cole), when the question is

raised, "Has it become your ruler, your god ...",
the response is, "Mell, no. Not exactly. It's more

Like where our technology triumphs have finally got
us to. I guess you might say our real ruler was al-
ways an ides of what's normal or not. Conformity, 1
guess you'd call it ... I suppose the Machine —
Plus the F.D.I, — working together — have sort of
externalized it once and for all." In the stories
where there is 2 struggle between man and the con-
puter, it is not @ struggle to retain control but to
yet it back once it has knowingly been given away or
unwillingly allowed to slip away.

Consequences of Bigness
The persistent theme in these stories is that of
158 — big states and big computer systems —

its consequences. This bigness iswell described
‘an article by Neizenbaum. This article is impor-
tant because it is one of the few expository state
ments of this serious thene.

‘These often gigantic systens are put to-
gether by teams of programmers, often working
er a time span of many years. By the time
the systems come into use, most of the origi-
‘al programmers have left or turned their at-
tention to other pursuits. It is precisely
when gigantic systems begin to be used that
their inner workings can no longer be under-
stood by any single person or by a small team
Of individuals. ... This situation, which is
now upon us, has two consequences: first that
decisions are made on the basis of rules and
criteria no one knows explicitly, and second
that the system of rules and criteria becomes
immune to change. ("On the Impact of the Com
puter on Society.” pp. 612-613).

What is the effect of this situation on individuals
and on society? Two side effects are discussed by
Neizenbaun.

First of course, there is the psychological
Ampact on individuals living in a society in
which anonymous, hence irresponsible, forces
formulate the large questions of the day and
circunscribe the range of possible answers.

But even worse, since computer-based know-
Ledge systems become essentially unmodifiable
except in that they can grow, and since they
induce dependence and cannot, after a certain
threshold is crossed. be abandoned, there is
an enormous risk that they will be passed fron
one generation to another, always growing.
Cbid., p. 613)

Computers Are Not Gadgets

The reader may argue the degree to which these
side effects are already present in our society. but,
if he reads sicence-fiction, he cannot ignore then.
While the first theme of the differences of man and
machines may be the most repeated, this second thene
is probably the most important. The science-fiction
writers maintain their importance as poets of the
“computer revolution” by redirecting our attention
from the computer as “gadget” to the conputer as an
integral part of the modern configuration of govern-
ent ~acadene-industry-management which shares skills,
Fesources, techniques, personnel, and goals. Just as
our image of the scieatist has changed from the mon
Standing lonely vigil over a bubbling retort to

prove his scorned hypothesis, the isolated computer
with a programed quirk, asked the wrong question or
fed the wrong data, is no longer hero. Franken-
stein's monster, oF the more recent, Karl, Eny, and
Siena, for example, are very linited creations with
identifiable creators, circumscribed environnents.
and restricted effects. We now have instead Shal-
maneser, Project 79, Vulcan 3, Allied Masterconputer,
or simply, The Nachine. The new conputer-hero has
remote access, varied input and output devices. pro~
cesses large amounts of data supplied by different
agencies, works in real-time, makes policy decisions
based on quasi-nathenatics. conmands vast resources,
and affects large numbers of people.

The Fox of Mt, Etna and the Grapes

Once there was a Fox who lived on the lower slopes of
Mt, Etna, the great volcano in Sicily. These slopes are ex-
tremely fertile; the grapes that grow there may well be the
most delicious in the world; and of all the farmers there,
Farmer Mario was probably the best. And this Fox longed
‘and longed for some of Farmer Mario's grapes, But they
‘grew very high on arbors, and all the arbors were inside @
Wineyard with high wails, and the Fox had a problem. Of
course, the Fox of Mt Etna had utterly no use for his farn-
us ancestor, who leaping for grapes that he could not reach,
called them sour, end went away.

‘The Fox decided that what he needed was Engineering
Technology. So he went to a retired Engineer who lived on
the slopes of Mt. Etna, because he liked: the balmy climate
‘and the view of the Mediterranean Sea and the excitement of

" EDITORIAL

(an updated version of an editorial first printed May 1973)

Burying Facts and Rewriting History - Il

One of the efforts of this magazine is to pursue truth.

‘One of the ways in which truth is pursued is not to let
statements of the utmost importance be buried and for-
‘Peten in the pages of daily newspapers, nor unreported
and lost because they are no longer well covered in nation-
al news magazines.

Among those statements are two of permanent interest
in connection with the Watergate Caper (this phrase is es-
tablishmentese for “the Watergate Crime”),

— The statement by Bernard L. Barker, one of the con-
victed operatives, which explains his motivation
and background (see November 1972, Computers
and Automation).

— The statement by Alfred Baldwin, 3rd, ex-FBI agent,
an employee of the Republican Committee to Re-
elect the President, telling what he did and saw
while five men burglarized the Watergate offices
of the Democratic National Committee on June
17, 1972, about 2:30 a.m. (see December 1972,
C&A).

In addition, we have published seven installments of re-
ports on the Watergate Crime by our contributing editor,
Richard E. Sprague (a computer professional of 25 years
standing) who as an avocation has studied for many years
dirty political operations in the United States, including
the assassinations by conspiracies (not “one assassins”) of
President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and
Reverend Martin Luther King.

Three years ago in May 1970, when we began to pub-
lish this type of article, we could not have spoken confi-
dently of “the assassination by conspiracies” of two
Kennedys and one King. But the articles we have pub-
lished — which are listed and characterized on the follow-
ing pages — have together a remarkable impact.

Taken together, the information published May 1970 to
October 1973 in Computers and Automation effectively
destroys a large segment of the beliefs, the rewritten his-
tory, that the establishment in the United States has
arranged for people in the United States to believe. I do
Not assert that the establishment is a conscious organism
or organization; perhaps the best description is this: a
loose confederation of overt conspiracies, silent conspir-
acies, and biased wealthy persons, with very intelligent
orchestration stemming from the Pentagon, the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Presidency, and with assists
from organized crime and the Mafia.

We challenge any fairminded person to read this col

may be ordered from us), and after reading them, to still
believe that the assassinations are actually the actions of

“Jone psychopaths,” instead of fitting together into a plan
to install a certain kind of autocracy in the United States.

This kind of autocracy claims to be democratic, to
stand up for “national security,” “executive privilege,”
“separation of Constitutional powers,” etc. It offers ap-
pearances of democracy, but it seizes the realities of
money and power. It cuts programs of social benefit; but
it allocates $80 billion a year to be paid to the military-
industrial-Pentagon complex.

In the 1940's there was a name for this kind of autoc-
racy. Its name was “fascism,” effectively a dictatorship
in the interests of big business, What is now appearing in
the U.S, is “fascism” in the form of a dictatorship by the
military industrial complex.

Here in a nutshell is an example of the present uneven
contest: it takes the form of two sentences in report by
E. Drake Lundell, Jr., in Computerworld for April 22,
197.

© The Antitrust Division of the Justice Department
is “outmanned and outgunned” when it comes to
prosecuting cases like the current action against IBM,
Senate investigators were told last week.
© In addition, witnesses before the Senate Antitrust
and Monopoly Subcommittee stated that often the
division cannot do its job properly because of polit-
ical pressure from the White House.
These two statements contain a world of implications.
Essentially, the Department of the United States Gov-
ernment which is charged with enforcing certain U.S. laws
against monopoly, can no longer properly function because
of (1) the enormous power of just one business, IBM, and
(2) political pressure from the White House (this phrase is
establishmentese for “President Richard M. Nixon”).

We must dig up facts, remember them, and write
history the wa

‘We must take action to compel the persons who deceive
us and lie to us to leave the government of the United

States, such as Spiro Agnew, former Vice President.

human failing. Even the most broad-ninded practi-
tioner is bound by his or her capacities and philos-
ophy, and it requires a deliberate and concerted ef-
fort to remain open-minded, and to appreciate varied
approsches that are not in accord with one's own
temporary aesthetic parameters. One discerns con-
puter artists who prefer natural or man-made pat-
terns and sounds, vs. those who desire only mathe~
matics, electronic and computer sounds, sans the
human touch. There are those who exploit two or
three-dimensional static images, vs. the creators
who prefer moving permutations in flux, declaiming
that the computer is a perceptual medium, and there-
fore should not be imprisoned in static’ form, i.e.
cybernetic art is “pure idea,” ad infinitum. Ironi-
cally, even the newest of the arts appears destined
to hardening within specific schools of thought.
with separatist camps warring in "vs." expression
and debate.

‘Summary

It is obvious that the concept of manipulation
and processing via the computer is merely the first
stage of cybernetic creation. Even now, far beyond
the statements of the artistic problem and aesthetic,
personal variation, is a vast, open territory that
is being explored by questioning, hardy intellec-
tual pioneers, as they seek to perceive the inner
anatony of art and philosophy:

What is style?

Wrat constitutes the aesthetic? How may this
be accomplished?

What is art? Music? Sculpture? Dance?
Poetry?

What is science? Mathematics?

Is art purely the man-nade: The sound of

fe human voice, or playing music upon
nenade instruments? The painting and
sculpting of aan with hand-held tools?

Is art a part of life, enbracing: The ordin-
ary, the animal and natural sounds? The
patterns carved by the winds, sands, and
the water?

Is art perceptual, a mere fleeting monent or
experience in time, or is it permanent, en-
during?

Wrat is the optimum role of man in a cyber-
netic society?

What is the role of art ina technology-ori-
ented world?

What is the symbiosis of man-and-the.

What is thinking?

What is creativity?

Is man the measure of all things?

chine?

Wen man uses the computer as an aid in creation,
or when he attenpts to create heuristic art, his
mind finds new questions to explore and to answer.
It appears highly possible that @ renewed perception
of life and the arts awaits present and future gen-
erations of man, and that this’ may be partially ac-
complished by eliminating the boundaries of compart-
mentelized disciplines. and by walking freely be-
tween art and science, by combining interdisciplin-
ary practices and materials, to hopefully bring
forth the ideal of an open, growing, and dimensional
perception of art/life for the human raée.

ince with a new editorial policy of allowing writers

Virtue, in Spite of Erroneous Conceptions

dP. Frankel
Deon of the Faculty
Hervey Mudd College
Claremont, Calif. 91711

“We think of knowledge 2s knowing how-to-do-it, wisdom as knowing whether-to-doit,
and virtue (if the answer is yes) as doingiit:”

In this article, I mean virtue in a much narrower
sense then the theologians, and I mean erroneous con-
ceptions in a much broader sense than planners of
parenthood,

Let me first speck of virtue.

We think of knowledge as knowing how-to-do-it,
wisdom as knowing whether-to-do-it, and virtue as
doing it. In this sense, at least in the universi-
thes, we think of scientists as knowing, the hunt

nurses, social workers and the like)
as: virtuous, that is, the do-ers.

‘The World is Full of Problems

Now the world is full of problems where we need to
know how to do it, whether to do it, and (if the an-
swer is yes) to do it. Each of us can make his own
Lst of pressing social problems: pollution, arns
Maftation, or population growth. Fortunately we are
reasonably well supplied with scientists, hunanists,
and technicians, To understand why we still have
these urgent problems, let us turn to erroneous con
ceptions,

‘The erroneous conceptions I wish to deal with
here are:

That it fs within the power of scientists and
engineers to choose to work only on projects
"in the public interest,” and

That the market place is where one discovers
the public interest.

Choice of Projects to Work on

Critics seen to assume that scientists and engi-
neers are {ree to choose their projects, and complain
that they fail to consider the real public interest.
Seientists may be free to choose their work, but they
‘Based on remarks delivered on Joweph C. Wilson Day, Noverber 10,

1872, at the University of Rochester, Rochester, N.Y.

have no more to say about how their discoveries are
used then Christopher Columbus did.

‘As for the engineers, they have more to say about
‘the uses of science, since they-are the ones who
choose which of science's ideas will be applied, but
they in turn have almost no way, at present, “of iden-
Ufying the public interest, and even less in determ-
ining which products or processes should be produced
to serve it.

‘A Moratorium on Science?

We will return to this matter of choice, but first
Jet's eliminate from the list of reasonable alterna-
tives facing society, the silly and dangerous notion
of a moratorium on science.

The key notion in the moratorium idea is that if
you can't control it, you shouldn't do it. There-
fore, we are urged, don't do any more science until
(presumably) the humanists devise suitable controls.
The trouble with this kind of conceptual contracep-
tion is two-fold, In the first place, as Paul Salt-
man has pointed out eloquently, you can't forbid
knowing any more than you can forbid writing poetry.
Science can be slowed down, of course, by driving it
underground, but even if we slowed it way down, there
As no evidence that we have either knowledge or wis-
dom enough to control its application, unless we
change sone of our habits.

Ignorance and Fear Lead to Irrationality

One habit that needs correction has to do with the
inking and feeling processes of the humanists

the philosophers, if you will — who presumably are
to show us how to behave, Too often théy are igno-
rant or fearful of science and engineering. What one
4s ignorant or fearful of, he cannot dee} with in
rational way, There is no possibility that we can
learn to control what we do by some non-rational
Process, such as satori, using mystically-fashioned
Playing cards, etc. Control over what we do will



have to be done rationally, I also believe that it
will have to be done by humanists, and that before
they can do it, we have somehow to lower, or at least
make more permeable, the barrier that separates the
‘Two Cultures, We will come back to this point later.
Before that, let us return to the notion that engi-
neers choose what they will work on,

‘The Choices of Engineers

Wost engineers do not make cosmic choices. They
do not decide that this product will be built and
that one won't be. Practically all engineers, I sus-
pect, work for other engineers, who work for others,
who work in companies where the products are deter-
mined not by science or philosophy, but by market

alysis. Now market analysis has cone a long way
since the days of the Edsel,’ and it often guesses

irately, although not always so, what the public

48 interested in buying, But what the public buys is
not necessarily what it needs.

‘The Market-Place Guessing Game

We buy those things that are offered for sale
that are better (in some vague way) than the alter~
natives available to us. Except for advertising or
other ways of influencing public opinion, the basic
mechanism of the market-place is a guessing gane.
Try this product, see if it sells. If it does, fig-
ure out what it was about it that sold, and push a
little harder. If this one does not sell, retrench
@ little, or gamble on another change — and so on.
Advertising and public opinion do play important
roles — how else explain so many different labels
‘on the same ber of soap, the same automobile? —
but the decision as to how the engineers’ skills
will be used has, in the past, been largely deter
mined by the instantaneous outcome of the market
game.

‘Major Civil Problems

Now please do not misunderstand me. The market-
Place mechanisms are important for determining soap
Or automobile styles. I believe that criteria of
Tiskeand-return of investment are elements of our
decision-making processes that we could discard only
at great peril to our society. What I am saying is
that the major civil problens: pollution, poverty,
‘and population density, for examples, are not likely
to be defined by market analysis,

These problems, for which acceptable solutions
are needed, share these characteristics:

First, they cross product classification lines,
and involve more than one sector of the econony.
They are not Just problems of the auto industry, or
the mining conpanies, or manufacturing-but-not-
Service-industries — they involve all of these.
AML the skills that all these sectors employ may
have to be applied to these problems. ‘The cement
Plants in the country and the transport companies in
the city have pollution problems that differ only in
detail. To expect them to do the necessary research
‘nd development. separately, each with his eye on his
own segment of the market, is to postpone until
auch too late, if not forever, salving even the
smaller parts of our problems. The problems, so to
speak, are too big.

‘Those Problems are Hardly Soparable

In the same way, the major civil problens are not
dily separable. One can reduce the amount af air

pollution caused by internal combustion engines by
using electric autos, for example. If so, we may
replace polluted air in the cities with polluted
streams out in the country where the new massive
power plants are, Or we can replace with solar
energy the fissionable materials or fossil fuels we
now use for power: however, at least in the near
future, we would then have either much less energy
‘or much more costly energy, and fewer jobs and more
(Some among us tend to paint even blacker
‘They point out that our society gave up
slavery only when our technology developed to the
point where machines were cheaper than slaves. Is
it possible that we could deliberately reverse this
Process and end up with clean air, but with slaves?)

‘This characteristic of tight linkage, or insep-
arab{lity of the big problems, also suggests that
we cannot rely upon the ordinary market-place mech-
anisms to determine how we employ our technology to
solve our problens.

‘Very Difticutt Problems

The third characteristic of our problems that
forces us to reconsider the mechanisms of choice,
is that our problems are so very difficult. The
technical solutions do not exist outside of social
considerations. The social costs outweigh such us-
val factor costs as materials, labor, and capita:
Our cities present much tougher problens than put-
‘ting man on the moon, AS someone smarter than but
unknown to me, has said, "We couldn't have put a
man on the moon if the moon had been inhabited".

World-wide and Nation-wide Problems

All these characteristics, and others that I've
Jeft out, such as geographical diversity — sone
Problems are not local, nor even regional or nation-
al, but world-wide — suggest that the organizations
needed for these new problem-solving teams differ
considerably from those of even our biggest, most
diversified companies, or else that we need sone
Super-industrial team of coordinators, who are to be
responsive not to the elements of the market-place,
but rather to the public interest, Whether that
Public is regional, or national or world-wide, some-
fone who has thought this problem further through
must tell, My ovm thoughts, tempered by a certain
sourly pragmatic view of the interactions of vari
ous national governments, suggests that the approach
most likely to succeed in the near future is the na-
tional one.

‘The National Science Policy and Priorities Act

‘The essentials of a first step in 2 national plan
are contained in the National Science Policy and
Priorities Act, which, among other things, sets up
Procedures for contracting out to universities, con-
panies and other organizations, the research and de
velopment necessary for solution of the major civil
problems, including the design of civil science sys-
tems, Whether an agency like NASA should be set up,
as the Act says, or whether an existing agency
should supervise new programs, is a matter of de-
bate. The importance to our discussion is that some
federal funding agency, not the various product
marketplaces, should establish the priorities and
fund the solutions to our civil problems.

As you see, this bill or Act or plan makes 8
first approach to nationalizing the solution to na-

thnmal nea

Zollections of scientific, humanistic and engineer-
{ng talent, that either already exist in the aero-
space companies, universities and think tanks, or
ean be collected there. In essence, this bill
Solves one aspect of the problem. It replaces small
or local or single-conmodity market-places with &

‘ket-place based on national needs.
suspect that the new agency will find that big sero-
space companies usually do not have the necessary
nix of talents, although they probably do have the
necessary organization. The universities, on the
‘other hand, probably do have the necessary mix of
talents, but probably do not have the proper organ-
ization. It seems, however, to be a logical first
step, and the sooner the bill becomes law, the
sooner we can begin to solve our problens.

International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis

‘An example of the international approach is the
recently established International Institute of Ap-
pIe=Systems Analysis in Vienna as a joint venture
‘of our National Academy of Sciences and the Soviet
Academy, among others. Since they will operate on
about three-and-a-half million dollars a year (the
Civil Science part of the National Science Policy
and Priorities Act allots an average of 270 million
per year for three years) it is unreasonable to ex-
pect anything more than papers for publication to
cone out of Vienna. The international effort will
Fesult in more knowledge and wisdon; on the pri
posed netional budget we could become virtuous as
well,

{In Order to be Virtuous
‘One Must be Wise and Knowing

One final caution, I hope you have not heard

me suggest that only scientists and engineers are
capable of leading us out of the thicket of diffi-
culties we are in, I am not advocating technocracy,
that totalitarian philosophy which says that only
engineers can lead us, I do not believe that for
fone moment, mor does anyone who knows enough engi-
neers and scientists. ‘There is no reason to believe
that they, as a class, are any more capable of
leading our people than, say, the lawyers.

I would rather that you heard me say that no

longer is it virtue merely to do it, but rather

that in order to be virtuous one must also be wise
id also knowing.

Our Leaders Must Be Part Scientist,
Part Humanist, and Part Engineer

We will need new kinds of agencies and organiza.
tions to define "the public interest" and to find
ways of organizing the talents that may solve sone
of our problems, But organizations — universities
and corporations and public agencies — are built by
people, led by other people. So our leaders must be
art scientist, part humanist, and part engineer,
and they ust use what they have, not in response to
some particular markei-place, but in the true public
interest. Not nearly enough people will be born
with these characteristics. They will have to be
educated,

If this sounds like a very tall order to put to
en education systen — it is. .

But we should be encouraged to redesign our edu-
cation systems to help produce such people, not only
because we have to (God knows we do) if mankind is

Nixon and the Mafia — Conclusion

Part 1 of "Nixon and the Mafia” was published in
the September issue of “Computers and Automation”;
Part 2, in the October issue. Part 3 begins here
with further information about the relation of
President-to-beRichard M. Nixon with shady trans~
actions in the Bahamas.

Shakoup in the Bahamas

By the middle Sixties there was a storm brewing.
Internal friction had forced out a few people like
Lou Chesler, while a wave of public investigations
were blaring the role of underworld figures like
Meyer Lansky. The 1967 Royal Commission of Inquiry
also dredged up another fomiliar name — Richard
Nixon.

Testimony before the Royal Commission by Max

* Courteney, a Lansky lieutenant, detailed 2 long
bookmaking career and brought out the names of a
large clientele, including the then ex-Vice Presi-
dent Richard Nixon.

Mary Carter Paint

‘The Royal Commission also bared a desl which in-
plicated Richard Nixon far more deeply than passing
mention by an underground bookie.

In 1967 Lyndon Pindling becane the first black
prenier ever to serve the almost one hundred percent
Dlack citizenry of the island. Pindling was hardly
@ revolutionary, however, for anong the people in-
strumental in putting hin in office was a gambler
close to Lansky named Mike McLaney. ‘The Royal Con-
mission branded NeLaney » "thoroughly dangerous per-
son” and accused hin of maneuvering Pindling into at
Teast one deal involving a questionable gambling
concession.

Part of the post-election controversy was 3 com
pany based in Tampa which bore the innocuous name of
“wary Carter Paint Company”. =.

In 1965 Lonsky's front-man (and former Key Bis-
eayne landowner) Wallace Groves, filed a joint ap-
plication with the Mary Carter Company to open a

even know it until they hand him the bill.”

casino on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The ubiq-
uitous Sir Stafford Sands handled the legalities.
Knowledgeable observers looked for the mystery man,
and 9 Justice Department meno, dated January 18,
1966, predicted thet "the atmosphere seems ripe for
a Lansky skin",

After Pindling's election, Groves was forced out
‘and the Mery Carter Paint Company had itself two new
casinos. At the 1967 opening of one of then — the
Nassau Bay Club — the honored guest was Richard
Nixon,

‘The following year — 1968 — the othe Nary Car
ter Club, the Paradise Island Casino, opened for
business. The owners felt close enough to Nixon to
offer him use of their facilities during the 1968
Republican Convention. Nixon felt more confortable
at Key Biscayne, but some of his staff took up the
offer.

Mary Carter Becomes Resorts International

In 1969 Mary Carter — now called Resorts Inter-
notional — reluctantly “released” one Dino Cellini,
eleiming that while he “had a relatively unsavory
background, he had no criminal record. no criminal
associates”. Cellini hopped across the water to
Miami, where, according to Dade County Sheriff Tn~
telligence Reports, he continued to work in conjunc~
tion with Paradise Island Casino. The reports al-
Lege that Cellini was an almost daily visitor to Re
sorts International 's Miami office, where he checked
credits and worked with 2 company booking junkets to
the Paradise Islend Casino.

There are those who maintain that Cellini's con
nections with Resorts International symbolize the
influence of Lansky. In a 1971 editorial, the Las
Vegas Sun concluded an eleven part series on organ-
ized crime — some of which centered on Resorts In-
ternational — by charging that “however cloaked and
cleverly concealed by the guardians, gambling in the
Bahamas is controlled by Meyer Lansky and it has
been established in police intelligence reports that
the fee is fifteen percent of the gross income”. The
now defunct Toronto Telegram reported in 1970 that
“observers believe thet the resourceful Lansky is
still managing to get his cut from the Bahamas”.

Resorts International, through its ninety-one
percent owned subsidiary, Intertel, has denied all
allegations of involvement with organized crime. It

wos'Intertel that ITT hired in 1972 to snoop on col
‘umnist Jack Anderson,

The Latest and possibly most damaging charge in
the Resorts International battle came in June 1972
in an IRS inspired indictment of Meyer Lansky and
Dino Cellini. The indictment reads in part:

On or about May 17, 1968, unindicted co-conspira~
tor Vincent Teresa met with defendants Meyer Lan=
ky and Dino Cellini in Mami and had @ discu:
sion wherein defendants Lansky and Cellini gave
Teress permission to conduct gombling junkets to
the Paradise Island Casino.

‘Thus government agents ellege thet in 1968 Lon-
sky maintained at least some control in running jun~
kets to Resorts International's Paradise Island Cas-
fino. The junket racket is an integral part of the
easino operation, and as recently as 1971 Lansky's

Eddie Cellini was reportedly still arranging
Junkets for the Paradise Island Casino.

Enter Nixon and Rebozo

It was in 1967 — with Lansky still okaying jun~
kets and Cellini still running the Paradise Island
Casino — thet Richard Nixon and Bede Rebozo became
friends with the head of Resorts International.

It should be no surprise that James Golden, the
recently (1969) hired “deputy director of security”
for Resorts International is a good friend of Nix-
on's. As g Secret Service guard for Nixon when he
was Vice President, Golden made @ good enough in-
pression to be appointed staff security chief for
Nixon in 1968. Golden was also security director
of Nixon's convention headquarters in Miami that
year. and was security director for his subsequent
inauguration. Later that year he moved to Resorts
Internetionsl. Golden is just one of along string
of interesting Nixon security appointees, among
them Watergate indictees James McCord, Gordon Liddy,
‘and Howard Hunt.

There are rumors, some of which have been aired
in the press, that Richard Nixon owns stock in Re~
Sorts International. Former Republican Presidential
candidate Thomas E. Dewey does own stock in the con-
pany, and, according to organized crime investigator
Hank Messick among others, there are reports of Lan-
cy buying stock as well. Nobody has proved any
thing one way or another about the stock connec~
tions, but that Nixon is connected to Resorts Inter~
tional, at least through Golden, is indisputable.

Perhaps more disquieting than rumors of Nixon
stock ownership in an underworld holding company for
Bahamian casinos are the reports of his meddling in
Bahamian affairs. In 1969 a proposed tax increase
on gambling profits to provide money for Bahamian
schools was slashed in half by the Minister of Fi-
mance. The Minister refused to explain the cut,
and told opposition members to "use your imagina
tion” for an explanation.

‘The advice was taken literally by some Bahamian
Papers who speculated that pressure came from "out-
Side sources connected with casinos”. One Bahamian
Paper asked openly if "a telephone call from the
White House was not responsible?” .

Mhereas our investigation into Cuban politics
brought evidence to light possible violations of the
Neutrality Act, we now have the possibility of an
American President who has spent a significant
amount of his vacation time in the Bahamas els0 med-
Gling in the affairs of that country.

Richard Nixon, a man with both visible and invis-
ible Links to the underworld and politics of pre:
Castro Cubs, turns up in the Bahamas with very simi-
ler Links, bringing some big manes slong with him.

Enter William Rogers

Two men with histories both in Bahamian politics
and in the finances of organized crime have made
frequent use of the legal services of a firm whose
ost prominent partner is Richard Nixon's old friend
William P. Rogers, one-time Secretary of State.

‘The two men are Mike McLaney, charged by the
Royal Commission in 1967, and a business cohort of
his named Millian Colusardo. McLeney and Colusardo

sre investigated in 1967 by the Securities and Ex-
change Commission in connection with a blueberry
plantation that scLaney sold to a company controlled
by Colusardo. The subsequent corporate jugglings
implicated (anong others) newly elected Bahamian
Premier Lyndon Pindling. Among Colusardo's “favors”
for Pindling were the use of his airplane during the
election campaign, ands $127,000 contribution in
‘the form of an “interest payment”. The law firm
that defended McLaney and Colusardo against the SEC
was that of William P. Rogers. “Rogers had been a
close friend and political associate of Nixon's for
twenty-five years. He accompanied Nixon on many of
his Bahamian jaunts and also made frequent stops
with him at the Key Biscayne Inn end Villas. In ad-
dition to being an "R GR" sidekick, Rogers was the
man Nixon turned to for counsel amidst his personal
crises in the Checkers affair and Eisenhower's seri
ous heart attack.

Rogers served the Eisenhoner/Nixon team for eight
years in the Department of Justice, first as Deputy
Attorney General, and then, by 1957, as Attorney
General. ‘The Justice Department's record against
organized crime in the years following the Kefauver
Commission was lackluster, to say the least. It was
Rogers who personally rejected the recommendations
of the specially constituted Wessell Committee on
organized crime set up in the wake of the infamous
Appalachian raid in upstate New York that revealed
a Mafia summit conference. The Committee's propos-
als for a concentrated and coordinated war on or-
Ganized crime were only implemented sone years loter
by Attorney General Robert Kennedy.

A footnote in the Justice Department files was a
report by IRS Special’ Agent Josph Delfine, dated Oc~
tober 19, 1953. The IRS recommended to the Justice
Department that “criminal proceedings be instituted
against Meyer Lansky in the Southern Judicial Dis-
trict of New York for the willful attempt to defeat
and evade a large portion of his income taxes for
the years 1945 and 1947 under section 145b of the
Internal Revenue Code". The Justice Department —
with William Rogers second in command et the time —
respectfully declined to prosecute.

“tums Hot Dogs

Upon leaving his post as Attorney General in
1960, Rogers became a member of the New York firm of
Royai, Koegel and Wells. In 1969, with its leading
partner about to become Secretary of State, Royal,
ete. moved with its clients wholeheartedly into the
world of gambling casinos and organized crine.

A year later Royal took on the account of the
Miawi-based hot dog chain, Lums Inc. What did a hot
dog chain have to offer a prestigious New York law
firm? The answer may lie in where the firm took its
client.


13-00000

In 1969 Lums purchased the Ceasar's Palace Hotel
‘and Casino in Les Vegas for $60,000,000. A month
Later the Nevada state gambling authorities were
Looking into the hotels’ “catering to twelve under-
world figures from Kansas City”.

A few months after the purchase the SEC filed
suit charging Lums and Ceasar’s Palace with "false
and misleading” statements. The SEC wondered how
Ceasar's managed to lose $1,000,000 in five months
when the previous year (before Lums bought in) there
was 2 $2,200,000 profit for a comparable time period.

‘The SEC also questioned Luns concerning the
‘$3,500,000 Lums paid one Jerome Zarowitz, a convicted
professional sports fixer who wasn't even listed as
an owner of the casino. Top officials in both Ces
sar's ond Lums have been under investigation by IRS
intelligence in Miami and by Nevada ganing authori~

in cases involving organized crime ever since
Rogers’ firm took on the Lums account.

There is also the question of the 1971 Lums ac-
quisition of a North Miami housing resort develop-
ment called Sky Lakes. Both Sky Lakes and Ceasar's
Palace have received large sums of money from the
Teamsters — $12,000,000 for the Miami project and
more than $16,000,000 for Ceasar's Palace.

With things going slowly, Lums announced plans
for 9 new $22,000,000 casino next door to Ceasar’s
Palace. In December of 1971 the company decided
‘that the whole restaurant idea was no longer worth
the trouble. In a classic climax to a classic Aner~
ican success they changed their name to Ceasar's
World Inc. and sold their hot dog stands.

Meanwhile the Secretary of State's old law firn
reaped a bundle with their new-found involvenent in
the Las Vegos underworld. With such stunning sue~
cesses at hone, one wonders what a firm with 9 link
to the Secretary of State could do abroad, in places
Like the Bahamas br Vietnam, for example.

Nor do the underworld implications of big nanes
surrounding Nixon end with the Secretary of State.
Murray Chotiner, a long-time Nixon aide and archi-
tect of his early smear campaigns, has past links to
the underworld. In 1962 Drew Pearson and Jack An-
derson wrote that "Chotiner ... besides representing
the top gangster of Philedelphia, Marco Reginelli
Tepresented a long and amazing list of hoods, con-
cession peddlers, income tax violators and others
Needing influence in nigh places It was Chot-
iner who brought Frank Vitale, "once involved in
the biggest bootlegging conspiracy on the West
Coast," ontoNixon's special plane to Moscow in 1959,

Nixon's recent appointment of Walter Annenberg as
Ambassador to England also echoes the thenes of un-
derworld involvement. Annenberg and his father were
indicted in 1939 for “siding and abetting” in con~
nection with their wire service operation inChicago,
‘n operation run with the protection of Al Capone,
for which the Annenbergs paid $1,000,000, The An-
nenberg family was also @ major contributor to Nix-
on's 1968 election campaign.

Further back in the Nixon saga, and closer to his
Southern California birthplace, liés San Diego fin-
ancier, C. Arnholdt Smith and his bookmaker partner
John Alessio. In 1946 Alessio and Sith introducad
Nixon to another bookmaker named Lew Lipinsky. Lip=
insky, who was convicted for bookmaking in 1938,
Served for three decades as a go-between for the
Salth/Alessio interests to their syndicate conne
tions.

Some of the dealings of the Smith/Alessio combine
were brought to national prominence by a recent LIFE
magazine article which accused Attorney General
Richard Kleindienst of “tampering with justice” in 3
ease involving Alessio. According to the Wall Street
Journal, Smith raised $1,000,000 for Nixon"s 1908
‘campaign. He and his wife took the first position
on the receiving line behind the President at the
White House inauguration.

More of the Same in California

Nixon's other favorite resting place besides Key
Biscayne is the area near his birthplace in southern
California. Here the underworld pattern of his
Florida involvements repeats itself — in a strik-
ingly similar pattern.

One story there involves Nixon's multi-million-
aire backer, C, Armholdt Smith, and the Del Charro
Hotel in Le Jolla, just north of San Diego.

The Del Charro was a favorite stopover for Nixon
in the Fifties. Owned by the Murchison brothers,
who also owned the nearby Del Nar race track, the
hotel played host to numerous Detroit and Las Vegas
gangsters. Alan Witwer, 9 former. manager of the
hotel, has alleged in statements to this repofter and
‘others that the hotel served as a secret meeting
place for politicians and assorted business inter-
ests, some of them from the underworld. Witwer spe~
cifically cited 2 1954 meeting attended by Nixon and
chaired by 2 leading member of ITT. He also claimed
that there was a bookmaking operation at the hotel,
but has offered no documented proof.

Mrs. C. Arnholdt Smith is a permanent resident of
the Del Charro, and the hotel's visitors have in-
cluded John Connally, Barry Goldwater, and J. Edgar
Hoover. Hoover's $15,000-a-year bills were picked
up by the stockholders of the Murchison interests.

The fact that certain of Hoover's good friends
rubbed elbows, rather warmly, with Meyer Lansky, and
the fact thatthe nation's leading crime fighting
agency — the FBI — has come up almost blank in its
fight against organized crime may not prove anything
about Hoover. On the other hand, these facts don't
make it any easier to dismiss questions which might
arise about the influence of organized crime at the
highest levels of governnent.

North of the Del Charro and thirty miles south of
the San Clemente White House, lies the mammoth La
Costa land resort development. The developnent is
tied to both Smith (his daughter is a director) and
to the Teamsters.

LaCosta was originally developed by Cleveland
syndicate reliables Allard Roen and Moe Dalitz. The
development was reorganized in 1968 to bring Team-
ster control more in line with their investments
which already exceeded $16,000,000. Like Sky Lakes,
its Florida counterpart, La Gosta attracts = whole
range of figures from organized crime. La Costa
visitors have included Willie “Ice Pick” Alderman,
2 St. Louis mob cohort Morris Shenker, and Wallace
Groves and Lou Chesler of Bahamas fame.

According to eyewitnesses, when Groves’ helicop-
ter sets down, the red carpet is rolled out. It may
be because Groves boight a hone in La Costa, but
more likely it's because, as government agents put
it, "where Groves appears, Meyer Lansky will not be
far behind”-

Another mob frequenter of the La Costa develop-
nt is Jake Arvey, an organizer of the Republic



13-00000

Nationa} Bank in Miami, the bank through which Ber-
rd Barker channeled funds for the Watergate crime,

‘The Teamsters Again

A recent visitor to La Costa was Frank Fitzsim-
mons, a key to Nixon's new-found support in organ-
ized labor. Fitzsimmons is president of the Tean-
sters Union. This sunmer he stopped in La Costa on
his way to see Nixon at Sen Clemente. Fitzsinmons
had just cone from dinner in Detroit with a local
Mafia figure ond soon after his Detroit-La Costi
Clemente excursion, Fitzsimons announced his sup~
port for Nixon. One wonders whether the Teamster
decision to stay on the Pay Board and to support
Nixon is somehow related to what the Detroit Free
Press has been hinting strongly as of late: that the
administration has stopped prosecution of Frank's
son Richard Fitzsimmons — the business partner of 2
Detroit mobster — on charges of missing union funds,
AwPSchange for Teamster support of the Republican
President.

Whatever desls Nixon and Fitzsimmons did moke,
the Teamsters have a long working relationship with
organized crime. Their marriage goes back over
‘twenty years, where Jimny Hoffa was introduced to
the Detroit underworld by Paul Dorfman, in exchange
for some multi-million dollar insurance business.
Dorfman's son, Paul, has residences at both Sky
Lakes and La Costa and was recently convicted of
taking kickbacks on 2 Teamster loan.

The Teamster tradition of labor racketeering and
corruption made for e ready alliance with the mob.
Early government investigations of the Teamsters,
Such as the Bobby Kennedy-led McClellan Permanent
Committee on Investigations, centered on labor rac~
Keteering. As Attorney General. Kennedy continued
his pursuit of the Teamsters and their boss, Jismy
Hoffa. At one point Kennedy had twenty-nine grand
Juries simtaneously investigating Hoffa's ectivity

one of which led to » conviction for mail fraud
and Jury tampering.

-In 1969, two Qakland Tribune reporters concluded
‘a Six-month investigation with the charge that "the
$28,000,000 Teamsters Central States, Southeast and
Southwest Pension Fund headquartered in Chicago, has
become a bankroll for some of America’s most sinis~
ter underground figure".

Nowhere does the relationship between this fund
ané the mob surface more dramatically than in Las
Vegas, where Teamster trustees have approved loans
between $50 and $70,000,000, some shakily secured by
Second mortgages and subordinated notes. A high-
ranking Federal official has commented that "the
Teanster fund is a sort of open bank to people well-
connected in Las Vegas and well-connected to organ-
ized crime",

It was Hoffa's desire “to have [his] own bank in
every city” that brought on the Teamster takeover of
the Mismi National Bank. The Bank in turn is just
one of a long list of ventures, suchas Ceasar’s Pal-
ace, Sky Lakes, La Costa, Worldwide Realty, Interna-
tonal Airport Hotel Systems, Truesdale Estates, in
which Teamster money amounting to over 360,000,000
figures prominently alongside the social and busi-
hess partners of Richard N, Nixon — a line of in
Vestments that leads from Nixon's three White Houses
to @ Federal clemency for Jimmy Hoffa and back to
organized crime.

The current head of the Justice Department's
Criminel Division saw enough evidence in 1967 to say

thot he "knew for # morel certainty [that] in the
upper echelons there is en analganation between the
Cosa Nostra and the Teamsters Union”. In 1971, when
a Federal Grand Jury probing the activities of Neyer
Lansky questioned Jimny Hoffa, many wondered whether
the links between the two giants were more direct
than the munerous transactions between mutual
friends.

A few months after his testimony, Hoffe was
granted clemency after serving less than five years
of his thirteen-year sentence. The freeing of Hoffa
and three co-defendents of the 1963 wire fraud pen~
sion case is the latest and most crucial event in
Nixon's longstanding friendship, a friendship with
some leer public benefits fur both. Jack Anderson
documents, for example, that as early as 1960, then
Vice-President Nixon and Attorney General Rogers in-
Lervened to halt an indictment against Hoffa in ex-
change for Hoffa's support in the 1960 election.

ANICO — More of the Same in Texas

In recent years the Teanster fund has been super-
seded by 8 giant Texas insurance conpany as 2 major
source of finance for Las Vegas casinos tied to the
nob. The company is the American Netional Insurance
Company (ANICO) of Galveston, Texas. ANICO is close

heart and pocketbook of the two ranking Tex-
ans in the Nixon administration — forner Treasury
Secretary John Connally and former Assistant Attor-
ney General Will Wilson.

‘As well as floating more than $40,000,000 to Las
Vegas casinos and $13,000,000 to premier mob attor=
ney Morris Shanker, ANICO has made loans to tno
Florida companies close to Richard Nixon —
$1,750,000 in 1966 to the Mary Carter Paint Company,
‘and $3,000,000 in 1970 to a subsidiary of Worldwide
Realty.

‘That year a group of disenchanted stockholders
filed @ multi-uillion-dollar suit, charging AXICO
officials with having taken control of the company
and using it as a private preserve as well as 2
source of funds for the mob. -

The defendants in the suit hired Nixon's New York
firm to handle the case. Connally's Houston law
firm has also been used by ANICO. The First Na~
tional Bank of Houston, of which Connally was a di~
rector and in which some of his law partners were
officers, has provided-an interest-free account of
more than $1,000,000 for ANICO. Connally was 2150
a director of @ Savings association which was pur-
chased recently by ANICO.

Will Wilson was “general” of the Justice Depart-
ments “war” on crine from 1969-1971. He was head
of the Criminal Division until October 1971, when
his resignation was forced by disclosures tying him
to the scandal-rocked financial enpire of Texas
wheeler-dealer Frank Sharp. Wilson has been charged
by dissident ANICO stockholders of helping to drag
ANICO into the twilight zones of finance with such
deals a5 the 1963 absorption of @ defaulted $450,000
mortgage held by Sharp. Sharp's attorney and

cial advisor” on the deal was Will Wilso

While Attorney General of Texas, Wilson sued the
foundation which controlled ANICO to bring three new
trustees onto the foundation's board of directors.
Wilson has no visible ties to the new trustees,
whose votes were instrumental in shaping the con-
pany's new financial course. But dissident stock~
holders have charged that the “negotiations” that

derworld.

When he came to the Justice Department in Wash-

sion looking into the affairs of ANICO. Since then
there have been no indictments in the case and there
are reports that Wilson had the ANICO files locked
fely in his personal office. One source of those

Whose Justice Department?

‘The ANICO case takes us to @ fitting endpoint to
the story of Richard Nixon's involvement with the
— the Department of Justice. It is an
that criminel and criminal-chaser eventually
become involved in the same business, but in Richard
Nixon that old saw has becone more of a reality than
perhaps ever before in Anerican history. For Rich
ard Nixon is a man whose name has been synonynous
with “law and order" in America for three decades.

Yet the four-year “wor” on organized crime by the
Nixon administration bears more resemblance to the
“peace” in Vietnam than a sincere effort to get at
the mob,

In a recent interview in U.S. News and World Re~
port (Septenber 11, 1972), Attorney Goneral Richard
Kleindienst hailed’ "about 1600" indictments of un-
derworld figures brought by the Nixon administration
in the past three and half years. The Justice De-
partment claims that many of these indictments in-
volve top mobsters.

‘Those outside the Nixon administration, however,
have charged that the government's prosecution has
been both partisan and selective, aimed exclusively
at mobsters linked to big-city Democrats such as in
Newark, and at the “Little fish who are always in
abundance and who make little difference in conduct-
ing mob business. Time has reported that quotas
have been established (i.e. one hundred hoodluns a
month for New York City) and that arrests are “being
delayed so that future quotas can be filled", The
New York Times has editorialized about the ease with
which petty gamblers can and have-been rounded up,
and wondered aloud if the Justice Department isn't
conducting more 2 publicity war than one on organ—
ized crime. A Times report this year found the gov~
ernment was building up 9 backlog of gambling in~

jetments, saving them for s crucial time during the
election campaign.

Indeed, while the Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell team has
used the spectre of "CRIME" to keep the fear level
high end to guarantee large budgets and expanded
powers for their Justice Department, the actual “at~
tempts” of the Nixon administration to cope with or-
ganized crime have resembled a somewhat sinister up-
date of the Keystone Cops.

For example, up to 1,000 of Kleindienst's vaunted
1600 indictees in gambling snd organized crime may
have their cases thrown out for somewhat dubious
“improper procedures” technicalities. A Mieni at~
torney naned Janes Hogan has "discovered" irregular-
ities on signatures required for electronic surveil-
lance suthorizstions. Court-approved wiretaps re-
quire written authorization by the Attorney General
of 2 designated representative, in this case Will
Wilson. Instead of being signed by John Mitchell or
by Wilson, the authorizations in question were
signed by aides, thus rendering thousands of wiretap
authorizations — and the indictments based on then
— useless.

Hogan himself is a long-time syndicate attorney
and partner of Ben Cohen, 2 forner political boss
of Miami Beach who figures prominently in the For~
ties" takeover of Miami by organized crime. The
case in which Hogan made his discovery involved the
busting of the largest heroin/cocaine ring #n Miani,
many of whose members were Cuban refugees. Inspec~
tion of various court papers, including wiretap
authorizations, confirmed “irregularities” in the
ignsture — Will Wilson's signature. While resen-
bling his actual handwriting, the signatures ap-
peared as “Wil” instead of “Will”.

While it may seem strange for an aide to misspell
his boss’ nome, it seems even stranger that Hogan
took the case.’ His normal fees start in five fig-
ures but he has been working on behalf of his court
dectared indigent client for more than two years
with minimal conpensation. While Hogan is known as
a "very thorough” attorney, it would be interesting
to find out more about the circumstances in which he
discovered the “irregularities

Even more interesting. perhaps. are the circum-
stances under which Richard Kleindienst was offered
a bribe of $100,000 to quash several mobindictnents
In sworn testimony inNovember 1971, Kleindienst admit
ted to being offered the $100,000 bribe (which would
be paid in the form of 9 contribution to Nixon's
1972 campaign) in exchange for stopping prosecution
against several underworld figures caught in a stock
fraud case. The bribe was offered by an aide of
Senator Hiram Fong, a Republican fron Hawaii. The
aide had worked previously with Kelindienst through
Fong's position on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kleindienst said he refused the offer but he also
said he did not realize it was a bribe for an entire
week!

In cross examination, the prosecutor asked Klein=
dienst, "If you had regarded the conversation as
something regarding @ bribe offer you would have in-
mediately report it, would you not?”

“Yes sir.” replied Kleindienst, “I would hav

One would expect the Attorney General of the
United States to be more alert. But what is more
troubling are reports aired in the Washington Post

shortly, efter the indictments in the stock fraud
fese in question (and ten months before Klein~
Gienst's testimony on the bribe). Those reports
quoted "sources at the U.S. Attorney's office in New
York" and indicated that after the meeting between
Kleindienst and Fong's aide, "Kleindienst innedi~
ately contacted Justice's Criminal Division (then
headed by Will Wilson) ond ... on FBI agent was as~
signed to infiltrate the group of alleged conspir
tors".

Do we now believe Kleindienst's story that he
“didn't realize” he had been offered a bribe, or
do we believe the U.S. Attorney's office in New
York? Did Will Wilson and the Justice Department
hold off @ week while Kleindienst ‘made up his
mind” that he had been offered a bribe, or was the
decision whether or not to take it? And did Hoover
and the FBI somehow interfere?,

ps the answer comes in the final outcome of
‘the eetual prosecution involved. The defendants in
the stock-fraud case included Meyer Lansky's son-in-
law, 8 former director of the Bank of Miomi Beach
and Johnny Dio, a notorious racketeer long associ-
ated with Jimny Hoffa. They were acquitted, while
the messengers who offered the bribe were convicted.
One wonders if that $100,000 did not find its way
into the Republican secret treasury after all.

‘The Tip of the loeberg

“The organized criminal relies on physical terror
and psychological intimidation, on economic Fi
teliation and political bribery, on citizen's in-
difference and governnent acquiescence. He cor-
rupts our governing institutions and subverts our
democratic processes.

= Richard Nixon, April 24, 1969

Someone should tell President Nixon that resist-
ing the power of organized crime demands, above all,
a President with a clean slate.

Nixon's life is like a complex jigsaw puzzle, the
pieces of which have been shuffled so as to defy
complete reconstruction. Some of the crucial pieces
have been reaoved, so a full picture cannot be
achieved. It is no accident that no other politi-
efan has been so much written about, yet so little
understood.

Indeed, much has been made of the “enigma” of
Richard Nixon, his tight-lipped bearing in relation
to his personal life, his unwillingness to divulge
what's really on his mind.

But maybe the answer to the enigma lies in his
old poker-playing instincts, in the unfailing abil~
ity to keep quiet when he's sitting on cards best
hidden from the table

For there is one indisputable fact about Richard

Nixon's career — his ascendancy to the pinnacle of

American power has required twenty-five years of

care and feeding by some very wealthy and very re~

actionary men, and an extraordinary number of them

have maintained connections with the world of or
nized crime. °

During Nixon's years in office the underworld em-
pire in the United States has prospertd almost unre-
stricted by the Federal government. From its base
in the gigantic resources of heroin traffic, gamb-
Ling, prostitution, “protection,” and a host of
other enterprises of violence against society, or~
ganized crime has moved like # bulldozer into the
world of legal, "respectable" business.

Every link between Richard Nixon and organized
erine, however marginal, is of significance, if for
no other reason because he is President. And there
are people all over Anerica, from government intel~
Ligence agents to hotel waiters, who have Nixon
stories to tell. He covers his tracks well, but not
well enough.

The full extent of Nixon's involvenent with or~
ganized crime is just beginning to surface. The
evidence in this article is merely the top of a
dirty iceberg that will slowly become visible over
the coming years.

The milieu in which he has traveled for three
decades, and in which so many of his friends, as-
sociates, and appointees have been related to the
nob, throw @ long and permanent shadow over every-
thing Richard Nixon the "public servant”
said, and over everything his political life has
ever meant.

For in light of his career, both past and pres-
ent, Richard M, Nixon seems to be the factual em-
bodiment of Ralph Salerno’s prediction that organ-
ized crime would someday put its own man in the
Wnite House.

Unsettling, Disturbing, Critical . . ~

Computers and Automation, established 1951 and
therefore the oldest magazine inthe field of con-
puters and data processing, believes that the pro-
fession of information engineer includes not only
competence inhandling information using computers
and other means, but also a broad responsibility,
in'a professional and engineering sense, for:

— The reliability and social significance of
pertinent input data!

— The social value and truth of the output
results. 5

In the seme way, a bridge engineer takes a pro-
fessional responsibility for the reliability and
Significance of the data he uses, and the safety
and efficiency of the bridge he builds, for human
beings to risk their lives on.

Accordingly, Computers and Automation publishes
fron tine to time articles and other information
related to socially useful input and output of data
systems ina broad sense. To this end we seek to
publish what is unsettling, disturbing, critical
— but productive of thought and an improved and
safer “house” for all humanity. an earth in which
our children and later generations may have a fu-
ture, instead of facing extinction.

‘The professional information engineer needs to
relate his engineering to the most important and
most serious problems in the world today: war,
nuclear weapons, pollution, the population exp],
sion, and many more,

NATIONAL AMERICAN BANK INSTALLS
COMPUTER-BASED SECURITY SYSTEM

Tom Burbank
Notional American Bank
200 Carondelet

‘New Orieans, Le. 70130

A computer-based system designed to prevent un-
authorized access to high security areas has gone
into operation at National American Bank here —
fone of the first U.S. banks to install such a sys-
tem. The IBM Controlled Access System (CAS) at N
tonal American is based on the use of magnetically
ericoded, wallet-sized identification cards sinilar
to bank credit cards.

Each person authorized to enter a security area
is assigned a card coded with his own security min-
ber. Employees seeking entry to an area covered by
the systen simply insert their cards into compact
Feading devices on entrance doors, and. the inforne
tion is transmitted to an IBM Systen/7 computer for
identification.

Stored in the computer's memory is a list of en-
ployee numbers and building areas these numbers are
designated for. If the munber of the card entitles
the bearer access to that area, the computer signals
the door to unlock. If the person is unauthorized
Yo enter, the door remains closed and a security
guard is notified. The elapsed time is approximately
e second.

If a card is lost or stolen, a new card (with 2
new number) {s issued and the system is alerted to
deny entry to the original card.“ If the old card
is used, the guard is alerted.

As an additional safeguard, the system can auto-
matically log all entrance activity by individual
security code, door number, date and tine of day.
‘This helps track who is where and for how long.
National American can now analyze the mumber of

tines an individual enters and at what tine of day
or night this activity occurs. The system also has
built-in failsafe mechanisms which insure security
in the event of a power failure.

“Unfortunately, we are doing business ina time
when public and private institutions are increas-
ingly vulnerable to lawless elements,” said National
American President Louie J. Roussel III. “By edding
‘the IBM Controlled Access Systen to our current se-
curity procedures, we are taking a major step to in
sure that our customers and employees are protected
And, by controlling access to the collateral’ instru-
ment storage areas, we can make it very difficult
for unauthorized people to gain access to valuable
assets stored in the bank.”

and a team of researchers fron the Center for Earth
Sciences and Engineering, use a Nova 620 conputer to
detect possible weak spots in the roofs of mines.
The computer systen, developed for the U.S. Bureau
of Mines, has been.on the Job on the floor of Kaiser
Corporation's York Canyon coal mine in New Mexico.
“One of the most frequent causes of mine accidents
is roof collapse.” Dr. Podio said. “This system was
designed to use the principles of seismic explora
tions to identify failure planes and fracture zones
in the rocks overlaying the mine roof. If tests

show the area around a roof is weakening, it can be
supported by beams or roof bolts.’

In seismic exploration, a high energy explosion
is set off, and sensitive instruments determine the
Structure and makeup of surrounding land by record-
ing how fast the shock waves travel through the
Ground. The waveforms can be interpreted to pin-
point probabie deposits of oil, and to describe rock
formations. "Using a large energy souce like an ex-
plosion in a mine is out of the question,” Dr. Podio
said, "so a manually controlled impact device was
designed to generate the shock waves." The impact
device, which works like 2 BB gun, uses air pressure
to shoot # round projectile at a striker plate
mounted at the end of the barrel.

When the striker plate is pressed against the
wall or roof of the mine and the device is triggered,
shock waves are sent through the surrounding rock.
Tag shock waves are picked up by wideband transduc-
igitized by a fast transient recorder, and

processed through the Nova 820 for waveform enhance-
ment. The waveform is then displayed on an oscil-
Joscope, with the results of velocity and depth cal-
culations. Permanent records of the waveform can be
sade on paper tape. or by transmitting the data to a
large scale renote conputer.

"A mine could make daily checks with the system
to detect changes in rock strata as the working face
of the mine advances,” Dr. Podio said, “or the sys-
tem could be transported throughout the mine to make
daily checks on the condition of roofs at predeter-
mined key locations." Or. Podio noted that siniler
systems could be used to predict the quality of rock
in rapid excavation projects or could be used in
ndestructive tests of large concrete structures.

‘The Bell System is using computer technology to
modernize production of the White Pages telephone
books. A system designed to improve customer serv-
ice, control costs and streamline massive record-
keeping operations is now being implemented. The
system — called DIR/ECT (for DIRectory projécT) —
was developed by Bell Laboratories, the research
and development unit of the Bell System. Michigan
Bell Telephone Company recently issued its first
directory containing listings produced by the sys~
tem. Michigan Bell also is using the system to
Produce some of its directory assistance records.

DIR/ECT is a sore sophisticated outgrowth of its

the New York Telephone Conpany under sponsorship of
the nationwide Bell System. The first directory
Produced by the PHOTAC system was distributed in
1966, Since then, New York Telephone has converted
sone" 4.5 million listings to the process. Currently
the 12'najor downstate White Pages directories are
Produced by PHOTAC.

‘The DIR/ECT system stores in a computer memory
@irectory information such as the cuStoner's name,
Address, telephone number — even telephone book
delivery instructions. The information in the com-
Puter memory then is fed into a device called a
Photocomposer, which provides ready-to-print list-
ings for white Pages. Besides the annual White
Pages directories, DIR/ECT produces daily updates of

new Listings and monthly reprints for the telephone
companies’ directory assistance operators.

Although customers may see no obvious differences
in the computer-produced directory, listings are
easier to read and pages cleaner looking. The di~
rectories also have uniform abbreviations. The sys~
tem has built-in cross-checks for consistent spell-
ing of street names and for obvious errors in street
‘and telephone numbers. There also is provision for
massive directory listing changes, caused by renan—
ing of streets and buildings.

Today, Listings for phone directories are: gener~
ally set line-by-line in metal type. Changes in
Listings must be reset and inserted by hand. kith
the new system, changes can be nade quickly (because

MALT. MUSIC PROJECT USES DEC COMPUTER

News Ottice :
Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Cambridge, Mass. 02139

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has be~
gun work on 9 project aimed at making the Institute
‘2 major center for the study and composition of
electronic music. Barry Vercoe, assistant professor
of music, working with 3 computer given to the De-
partment of Humanities’ music section by Digital
Equipment Corp. of Maynard, is in the early stages
of developing a major electronic music production
facility at the Institute.

Professor Vercoe said the computer facility "will
be 2 tool both in the hands of the teacher and the
composer that will greatly aid the development of
ereativity. The facility also will provide an ex-
cellent tool in the teaching of musical composition
for conventional instruments.

“This is definitely not a scientific project. I'm
not interested in merely getting @ computer to sound
exactly like a trumpet. The technological applica-
tion, however, will interest some students who might
not approach music otherwise and sone of these will
be drawn into its aesthetic considerations, through
the back door as it were," Professor Vercoe said.

Wny compose music for a machine at all?

"I suppose someone asked that very question when
man first composed music for what are now traditional
instruments, instead of for the human voice alone,”
Professor Vercce said. "Electronic music merely ex-
pands the forces available to the practicing con-
poser.”

‘The POP-11/45 computer — coupled with music in-
put — also will lend itself to other forms of music
esearch, such as syntactic analysis of music struc-
tures.

Professor Vercoe is the author of the widely used
Music 360 language for digital sound synthesis. He
has taught at M.I.T. for two years and is director

of the Experimental Siusic Studio. His work, "Meta.

morphoses for Orchestra,” was given its Boston pre-
mier early this year by the N.I.T. Symphony and xas
performed by the orchestra on its subsequent nation-

(COMPOSING BY COMPUTER AT ISU

Intormation Service
Jowa State University of Science and Technology
Ames, lowa 50010

Music composers at Iowa State University may turn
from their plano keyboards and hand-written scores
toa more efficient instrument for composing music
— a computer. ISU faculty members are building
computerized electronic music studio — a systen
that will technologically simplify composing elec-
tronic music. The studio is being designed and
built by an interdisciplinary group from Io
State's music, computer science, and electrical en-

Meprering deparunents, under the direation of Stefan

Iverston, assistant professor of computer science,
Terry Snay, professor of electrical engineering, and
Gary White, associate professor of music.

Electronic music is produced by purely electronic
means and the Iowa State Computerized Music System
{ASMUS) will be doing just that — generating music
with computer equipment. A composer will sit at the
computer and write a musical composition using an
electronic keyboard.

The new system, which was expected to be operable
‘this fall, should be an easier method of modifying
and editing a misical piece. The normal hand opera-
‘tions of changing notations on a printed score or
splicing tapes of recorded misic are "more tine
consuming and inaccurate” processes for correcting
composition, according to Gary White.

‘The computer composing process begins when the
composer inserts introductory instructions into 2
teletype machine. On an electronic keyboard he then
begins to compose his piece. The computer records
al musical instructions which are transfors
through a digital-to-analog sound converter and
loudspeaker into sound. This immediate feedback
system enables the composer to hear what he is com
Posing simultaneously. The computer also allows. the
composer to automatically play back and edit what he
has written simply by striking another key.

‘The musician has now completed one “layer” of
music. If he wants to add further musical instruc~
tions to the composition, he repeats the entire pro-
cess again. All layers merge together to obtain the
Product — a completed electronic composition.

‘The music instructions which the composer inserts
into the systen are a special electronic music nota-
tion — a “computer language.” The English words it
uses can be compared to musical notation found on a
conventional score — treble and bass clefs, notes.
Fests, and the like.

Electronic music has been used in conmercial re-
cordings, and as background music for television,
radio and film. The Towa Siate system will be so-
Phisticated enough for use in serious compositional
Study, the production of background music for vari-
ous media, and for the demonstration of sound prop-
erties.

‘The ISMUS presently being built is a protytype of
a full-scale model. If the "test-systen” proves
satisfactory, "we will look for funding to build a
full-scale model.” says White. The project is pres-
ently supported by a $1,170 grant from Western Elec-

tric and a National Science Foundation institutional
grant of $8,698. The prototype employs a mini-con-
puter that is owned by Iowa State.

The studio will be used as a teaching tool for
the ISU music program. Computer software, the pro-
grams (sequences of operations to be performed by
the computer) written for the system, will be devel-
oped 0 a composer can use the studio equipment
without having prior knowledge of computer progran-
ming. Students will be able to learn basic acousti-
cal concepts and principles of electronic music syn-
thesis and to develop sensitivity to timbre with the
ISMUS. Also contributing to introductory computer
science courses, the system will be a novel example
of computer application in a non-scientific field.

STUDENT PROGRAMS COMPUTER
FOR REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION

Maynard, Mass. 01754

Using programs developed by 2 local high school
student, School District 91 in Idaho Falls. has put
its newly-aequired computer tg work as a "super
tutor” in remedial studies for disadvantaged child-
ren in this southeastern Idaho comunity. Designed
to improve the arithmetic and language arts skills
of children in grades 2 through 6, the project was
introduced by director of curriculum Dr. Kallace
Manning with federal Title" aid during the dis-
trict's 1973 summer session for children largely
fron rural farm families. According to John A.
Christensen, computer sciences coordinator, the
project proved so successful in its initial appli-
cation that it has been continued in the fall se.
mester,

The student programmer is Robert Huntsman, 18, @
June graduate of Idaho Falls’ Skyline High School.
Using the district's PDP-11/20 timesharing computer
system installed last December by Digital Equipment
Corporation, Huntsman developed programs for arith-
metic and language drill to serve between 40 and 50
Pupils on each of two teletypenriter terminals situ-
ated in local elementary schools.

In a typical arithmetic routine, the computer
types @ problem and waits for the pupil's response
— ten seconds if the problem is a memory exercise,
longer if it involves several columns for addition
or several digits for multiplication. If the stu-
dent's answer is correct, Huntsman's program directs
the terminal to ring a bel! in congratulation; if
incorrect, the computer supplies a hint on where the
mistake occurred and encourages him to try again.

Answers to English and social studies workbook
questions have been entered in the computer menory.
allowing students to do their homework at a terminal
and receive inmediate response. The computer keeps
‘score of right and wrong answers to produce reports
for teacher guidance. Spelling-recogni tion exer-
cises are also in use and Huntsman has undertaken
development of an arithmetic program involving frac-
tions

“one of the computer's major advantages is its
ability to pay attention to individual children,”
Christensen said. “Every child enrolled in the
Feguiar summer session was able to get experience
at a terminal and benefit from these interactive
programs.” He said high school laboratory assist-
ants will continue to write instructional programs
for elenentary and junior high levels, expanding the
Library begun by Huntsman. For future sunmer ses-

‘sions, he added, the district hopes to make such
computer assistance available at a nearby rural ele-
sntary school attended by children of migrant farm
workers.

“TALKING” BALLPOINT PEN UNDER DEVELOPMENT
Ronald |. Deutsch

‘Stanford Research Institute

‘Menlo Park, Calif. 94025

A prototype model of a simple, inexpensive “tall
Ang” ballpoint pen, under development at Stanford
Research Institute (SRI), could reduce massive pa-
permork and delay in routine business transactions.
‘The pen is similar to an ordinary pen in size and
shape except that it is wired to a computer systen.

‘eonputer is programmed to receive signals gener-
ated instantaneously as a person hand-prints charac-
ters with the pen to record information.

“Such instantaneous and renote processing of data
might be invaluable to large businesses engaged in
daily consuner-oriented services, such as banks, in-
surance companies and utilities,” says staff scien-
Uist Dr. Hewitt D. Crane, the inventor. For exan-
ple, the pen could be used by a bank teller credit
ing'a savings or checking account. In this case,
according to Dr. Crane, the data would not have to
be retranscribed fron a piece of paper by another
employee, or the paper itself put through expensive
automatic reading equipment. Thus, costs’and de-
lays could be reduced in crediting accounts or es-
teblishing cash requirements.

another case, a meter reader making his rounds
for a utility could use the pen in combination with
@ cassette recorder. When he returned to his of-
fice, the cassette tape would be progranned into the
systen, thus eliminating the need for manual re-
transcription of a day's worth of data.

In the present laboratory version, the pen is
hooked to an audio unit as well as a teleprinter,
So that as a person writes, the characters appear on
the teleprinter and are spoken by the audio unit.

SRI holds @ patent on the pen and is currently
seeking financial support for further developnent,
Dr. Crane says. He estimates that the pen itself
might cost about $25 to $50. A central computer

unit would be extra but could serve many pens.

It’s the first lie detector that
can be used on a dead
man. It works on tapes and
other voice recordings

2

oD by George O'Toole

SAS SUTAION| ae

The rulers of the state are the only ones who should have the privilege of lying, either
at home or abroad; they may be allowed to lie for the good of the state.
—Plato: The Republic, Book Three

Is a little frightening. The machine can listen to what you're saying and tell, with
a high degree of retiability, whether or not you are lying. i's called the Psychological
Stress Evaluator, and it is, in effect, a lie detector. Unlike the polygraph, it needs
‘no physical connection to the subject; therefore it can be used without his knowledge.
It works from recordings of his voice, so anything on tape, sound track or phonograph
record is fair game for the machine. It is the first lie detector that can be used on
adead man.

Early this year, one of these instruments came into my hands. | resolved to use
itto probe one of the darkest mysteries of recent history, the assassination of President
John F. Kennedy. ! set about collecting every recording | could lay my hands on
of anyone who had any direct knowledge of the affair. Soon | had compiled the tape-
recorded testimony of twenty-two persons—eyewitnesses, Dallas policemen, the
Pathologist who conducted the autopsy, members and staff of the Warren Commission,
Jim Garrison, Clay Shaw, and even Eart Warren

Iran the tapes through the PSE systematically, taking each controversial point in
turn. Did the rifle which belonged to Lee Harvey Oswald kill President Kennedy?
Was Oswald the killer? Were others involved? What of those mysterious autopsy photo-
graphs which the Warren Commission never saw—do they support the Commission’s
fone-gunman, singie-bullet theory? And what about the Warren Commission itself?
Did its members conspire to cover up the truth?

Slowly a picture emerged. It is blurred, and it is not the picture ! expected. Not
all the details are there, but | guarantee this: you may believe the lone-gunman theory
of the Warren Report, or you may believe the government-conspiracy theory of Mark
Lane, Jim Garrison and others, but either way you are wrong,

‘The PSE is not a crystal ball. It was invented as an interrogation aid, a function
it performs well. To my knowledge, this was the first instance of its use as a tool
for historical research. To understand what | did with the PSE, one should know some-
thing about the device itself.

| first heard of the Psychological Stress Evaluator last year, when | met two of
its inventors, Alian D. Bell, Jr., and Charles R. McQuiston. Bell and McQuiston, both
former lieutenant colonels, retired from Army Intelligence several years ago to form

the chart paper is stopped, and that's all
there is to it. The result is a strip of paper
with a squiggly line. The rest is up to the
human eye and brain.

Iran my first rea! interrogation

The interrogation atways includes the
question. “Are you afraid that |
about something we have not discusseo™
A negative ans.i2r with no sign of s:rass
eliminates the outsidz-issue problem. Also,
the examiner always asks some innacuous
questions, such as. “Do you iike the color
blue?” in order to obsarve the subject's
general state of tension. And there is always
one "red-herring” question.

The ted herring is used to identity the
“guilt complex responder.” Such a gerson
shows stress when he responds to any
accusatory question. The examiner may
ask, “Did you steal the watch?" when it is
money, not a waich, that is missing. A
stressed denial will alert the examiner, who
carefully compares this response to the
stress produced by questions about the
missing money.

That night the class was given tapes of
real police interrogations. In most cases,
Kradz was the examiner, and in every case,
he knew the background and resolution of
the matter. One case | was assigned con-
cemed a young man accused of stealing
‘money from his father's store. Kradz stared
by asking the “outside-issue” question. No.
the young man replied, he was not afraid
Kradz would asi him a question they hadn't
discussed. Then the following exchange
took place:

“Do you live in Howard County?"

“Yes.”

“Do you suspect someone of having taken

“Yes.”
“Do you know who took the money?"

fe you wearing a ring?
"Yes."

“Did you take the money?”

No.

There were a few red-herring questions
to check for the guilt complex response.
The questions about wearing a white shirt
and a ring and living in Howard County had
been included to measure the background
stress elicited by irrelevant issues.

a member of the Warren Commission's statf,
was the guest. The transcript was of a CBS
News television program entitled The War-
ren Report, vihich had been broadcest in
four one-hour segments on June 25, 26, 27
and 28. 1967

Texamined the transcript. The programs
had been narrated by Walter Cronkite and
other CBS newsmen. They reviewed every
major point of controversy that had been
raised by the critics of the Warren Report
inierviewing eyewitnesses. Dallas police-
men. madical examiners, ballistic special-
ists and many others who had some inside
knewledge of the assassination of John F.

Most of the exchange between Liebler.
Lomax and the audience wes arguienta-

points. | found two key statements by Lied-
ler, though, and | charted them,

‘The first statement, in response toa ques-
tion by Lomax, was, “I have no doubt about
the conclusions of the [Warren] Regori.”
Plenty of stress was evident. but not much
more than in other statements.

The second statement related to those
Warren Commission documents which were
not included in the Report—they were
locked up in the National Archives. Lomax
asked Liebler if there was anything in the
documents which would alter Liebler's
opinion. Taken literally, it was a strange
question, since Liebler had seen the docu-
ments and. if they would alter his opinion.
they would already have dene so. Lomax
probably meant to ask if the documents
‘would conflict with the conclusions of the
Warren Report. Whatever Liebler thought
the question meant. he answerea quickly.
"Oh, none, none at all.” The PSE showed
much more stress here than during any of

Jebler’s other statements.

The coincidence of the box numbers

ity in the assassination. Tne lesson o! this
episode is twotold. First. stress in ary one
person's testimony does not prove decep-
tion. Second. given enough testimony by
different witnesses, the PSE can arrive at
the truth

‘The first person | ran on the PSE who had
any direct knowledge of the assassination
was Oswaid’s widow, Marina. Untortu-
nately, only one of her statements was on
the CBS tapes—that Oswald had owned a
title. The PSE said she was telling the truth.

The rifle had beer one of the major points
of controversy raised by critics of the War-
ren Report. The debate centered on two
points: whether the Mannlicher-Carcano
alleged to have belonged to Oswald was
the rifle found by the Dallas police in the
‘Texas Schoo! 80k Depository, and whether
that particular gun could have been the mur-
der weapon. a

‘On the tapes, Darrell C. Tomlinson. an
employee of Parkland Hospital, testified
thathe had found a rifle bulleton a strefcher
which he believed had carried Governor
Connally. There was no stress in his state-
ment. The PSE said he was telling the truth

Or. Joseph D. Nicol. Superintendent of

Perhaps the greatest source of con-
wersy over the Warren Report is it's claim
atall the shots ware fired by one gunman
ame eyewitnesses claim to have heard
ols and seen gunsmoke in the area o!
low hillock ahead and fo the right of the
esidential motorcade. This hillock has
wme to be known as “the grassy knoll.”
ne of these witnesses was a railroad
orker named S.M, Holland, who observed

the scene from an overpass near the knoll
The PSE confirmed that he thought he had
seen a puit of smoke on the knoll, but it
could not support his claim that he had
heard a shot from that direction

‘Another witness, Charles Brehm, was
quoted by Mark Lane as having said that
he had seen a portion of the President's
skull flying hack over the left tear end of
the limousine. Lane offered this as evidence
ofa shot from the grassy knoll. On the CBS
tapes, Brehm stated heatedly that he had
been quoted out of context, and emphatic-
ally denied that any shots had come from
the knoll. Despite his emotional state, there
was almost no stress in this statement

Officer Jacks of the Dallas police, who
was riding in the limousine of Vice-
President Johnson, denied that any of the
shots had come from the direction of the
grassy knoll. The PSE turned up a fair de-
gree of stress.

Three witnesses, Mrs. Caroline Walther,
Amold Rowland and Howard Brennan,
claimed to have seen gunmen in the win-
dows of the Texas School Book Depository
building. Mrs. Walther said she saw two
men, one armed with a rifle, the second

with a shorter gun, Rowland told the Warren
‘Commission he had seen two men, one an
elderly Negro, in the window Oswald is
alleged to have fired from, but on the CBS
tapes he claimed he had seen an armed
man ata different window. The Commission
relied heavily on the testimony of Brennan,
who claimed to have seen a gunman in the
"Cswaid window” actually firing the last of
the shots. The PSE showed hard stress in
the testimony of all three witnesses.

The PSE analysis of the eyewitnesses’

testimony regarding the source of the snots
is ambiguous. It supports Holland's claim
to have seen a puff of smoke on the knoll,
and Brehm's denial that any shots came
from that direction, and it raises serious
doubts about all other claims and counter-
claims, This contradiction seems to result
from the notorious unreliability of eyewit-
nesses, perhaps compounded by a fair
amount of fabrication. Deception, if it is
present here, may have been motivaled
merely by @ Gesire for attention. Or there
may have been darker reasons.
. There is, however, other evidence and
testimony that could shed some light on the
existence, number and location of assas-
sins other than Oswald. This brings us to
Perhaps the most dubious and controversial
element in the Warren Commission's ver-
sion of the event—the autopsy.

Within minutes after the shooting. Ken-
nedy had been rushed to the emergency
room at Parkland Hospital, where Dr. Mal-
colm Perry tried to save his life. The physi-
cian saw that the President had suftered
amassive head wound and a smatlerwound
in the throat. Perry performed a tracheos-
tomy, cutting through the throat wound in
an attempt to open a breathing passage
Afterward, when hope for the Presidant had
been abandoned, Perry met with the press
and dectared that the wound in the front
of the neck had been an entry wound.

The President's body was flown to
Washington, D.C. There. approximately
eight hours after the shooting, an autopsy
was performed at Bethescia Navat Hospital
Because of the tracheostomy, the nature of
the neck wound coutd no longer be ob-
served and was, at first, overlooked. Later,
after consulting the Dallas doctors, the
Bethesda pathologists concluded that it
was an exit wound. The autopsy report
stated that there were two entry wounds,
fone low in the rear scalp and one at the
right base of the neck: and two exit wounds.
the throat wound and a large irregular
wound on the right side of the head.

The confusion was compounded when
two FBI agents present at the autopsy
reported that a wound had been found in
the President's back, and that no core:
sponding exit wound had been located
Diagrams made during the autopsy seemed
to confirm this, showing the lower of the
two entry wounds to be below the shoulders
not at the base of the neck. What became
of the bullet? The agents reported that
Bethesda doctors thought the butlet had
dropped from the wound when the Dallas
doctors attempted extemal heart massage.
But this was the shot that the Commission
claimed had passed through Kennedy and
struck Governor Connally.

X-tays and color photographs of the au-
topsy were made. The brain was removed
from the body. Brain and skin tissue slides
were prepared for microscopic examina-
tion. Remarkably, the Warren Commission
never asked to see any of this evidence.
relying instead solely on the testimony of
Captain James J. Humes, one of the
pathologists who conducted the autopsy.
Even more incredible is the disappearance
of the brain, the slides. and some of the
photographs, which were alleged to have
been ured over to the National Archives
by the Bethesda Naval Hospital

Both Dr. Perry and Captain Humes were
interviewed on the CBS tapes. Perry was
asked about the throat wound he'd seen
when the President was brought to Parkland
Hospital. His answer seemed evasive. He
neither confirmed nor denied that he had
thought it was an entry wound, taiking in-
stead about the difficulty of making such
a datermination and the fact that his atten-
tion had been devoted to saving the Presi-
dent's fife. Then the interviewer asked him
directly whether he had thought at the time
thatitwas an entry wound, “Actually, I did't
really give it much thought,” he replied. He

which was part of a series called The Bran-

the Committee provided me with the tape

The interview was an hour long, but the
Kennedy assassination and tne Warren
Commission came up only once. The inter-
viewer, Abram Sachar. Chancellor of Bran-
Geis University, was friendly and deteren-
tial. | charted some of Warven's remarks
unrelated to the assassination and found
that he was generally unstressed, Sachar
raised the subject of the Commission
objiquely, and Warren volunteered several
rather lengthy statements about it

Warren said that ummediately ater the as-
sassination there ware wo theories. one that
Khrushchev and Castro were behind the
Killing, the other that a groua of right-wing
Texas olimen were responsiole. He said:

“We explered both of those theories for
ten months and found no evidence that
either of them was involved in it.”

The PSE showed hard stress.

‘He continued:

*... we found ro evidence of any kind
that there was any conspiracy.

Again there was stress, and particulariy
hard stress on the words “no evidence.”

“LT have read everything.” said Justice
Warren, “that has come to my notice in the

Ihad charted the last of the assassination
tapes. Of course, these few thousand fest

news departments. There is, for example.
Lee Harvey Oswald. as he was 'ed through
the Dallas potice station, denying that he
had killed the Presiaent’ There are state-
ments by Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby and
by others.

I have no doubt that with these tapes,

of the assassination of John F. Kennedy
could be reconstructed, a picture that might

far as the private resources of a frea-lance

What. given the sample of testimony 1
have processed with the PSE. can | say
about the assassination?

We should first examine the testimony in
whichno stress was found, since itis almost
cenain that these people were telling the
truth as they saw it. This strongly suggests
the following:

1. Oswald owned a rifle.

2. A bullet fired from that rifte was found
‘on Governor Connaily's stretcher at Park-
land Hospital

3. Bullet fragments alleged to have been
found in the presidential limousine also
came fram Oswald's riffle

4. Al least one eyewitness believes he
saw gunsmoke on the grassy knoll, but
another is equally certain no shots came
from that direction.

5. Oswald shot and killed Officer Tippit.

6. At least one member of the Warren
Commi
mission's statt really believe in tne validity
of the Warren Report.

7. Jim Garrison had little or no case
against Clay Shaw.

Almost all of this tends to support, in oné
way or another, the Warren Report. But now

“estion by the PSE:

It we accept that each instance of stress
indicates deception, an interesting and
unexpected possibility emerges

Oswald was involved in some way in the
assassination, if only as a fall guy. Some of
the Dallas police force may have been in-
volved. planted the evidence that imoli-
cated Oswald, and covered up the fact that
there was a conspiracy. The medical exam-
iner believed his own testimony to the War-
ten Commission, but later had doubts. The
‘Commission found evidence of a conspir-
acy but didn't believe it. so they covered
it up in order to present a tidy package to
the public. Later, at least one member of
the Commission changed his mind, but
since he didn't know what really did hap-
pen, he decided to say nothing. So there
was conspiracy in Dallas, and in Washing-
ton nothing worse than blundering

| could say all this with certainty if! knew
that stress always equais deception. Unfor-
tunately, 1 do not know that. But the PSE
analysis of the assassination tapes has
generated a staggering amount of fresh
doubt regarding the Warren Report. This
doudt rises not only from specitic points
the PSE has called into question, but from
the very sinister implications of the very
existence of deception among policemen,
government officials and Commission
members. The question remains: did such
deception exist or was the stress found by
the PSE the result, in every case, of an out-
side issue?

Obviously. whenever stress is found by
the PSE and cannot be cross-checked by
a structured interrogation, some probability
must be accepted that this stress 1s caused
by an outside issue. No study has vet been
conducted to establish witat this probability
might be, but let us pick. for the sake of
discussion, a figure that may seem ridicu-
lously high—70 percent. In other words. we
ara assuming that 70 percent of the times
the PSE finds stress in testimony. it results
from something other than lying.

‘Now, let's ignore the deception indicated
in the testimony of the eyewitnesses: even
if present, it might have resulted from mere
for attention. That leaves eight "in-
who have demonstrated stress when
making statements supporting the Warren
Report: the Daltas policeman Hill, Jacks,
Jackson and Weitzman: the medical exam-
iner, Captain Humes: Commission staffer
Wesley Liebler; Commission member John
McCloy; former Chief Justice Earl Warren.

Assuming that there is a 70 percent
chance that ary single instance of stress
is “outside issue,” what is the probability
that all eight insiances are due to factors
other than deception? Elementary proba-
bility theory tells us.that it is seven-tenths
raised to the eighth power, or approximately
6 percent.

1n other words, even making some fairly
conservative assumptions, there is 294 per-
cent chance that at least one of these eight
men is lying.

My own personal opinion? | don't know.
{remember the young man with the ring.
He said he was wearing it, and he was.
but he stressed. He stressed not because
he was lying, but because there was some-
thing about that ring that really bothered
him, something he didn’t want the world to
know. Perhaps that is also true of these men
who, in one way or another, leamed some
part of the truth about the assassination of
John F. Kennedy.

| suppose I'm not absolutely sure even
of that. When | first met Bob Smith of the
Committee, | asked him if there was any
one thing the government could do to clzar
up the mystery. Yes. he replied. the one
thing that would help more than anything
else would be to make available the physi-
cal evidence — the detailed FBI lab re-
ports, the X-rays and autopsy photographs,
the microscopic slides, the bloodstained
clothing, yes. even the President's brain,
wherever it has been hidden. These things.
he said, would go far toward answering the
questions about what actually happened
that day in Dallas. Maybe they would even
confirm the Warren Report.

‘So when I say I'm not absolutely certain
these men are concealing something, |
mean I can think of something that could
conceivably change my mind. That is, ifthe
goverriment would open all its files on this
matter to us and prove that we are wrong
—we, the people wio ten years later siill
believe we haven'tyet heard the full account
of the events of November 22, 1963.
