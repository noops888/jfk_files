The Moviniento Insurrecional de Recuperacion

(JFK

Revolucionario (MIRR) is an anti-Castro action group headed

by Orlanco Sosch Avila of Miami, Florida, which claimed

credit for severel bombing raids over Cuba in August and

September, 1963-

On December 11, 1963, a source who has furnished

reliable information in the past advised that Bosch is making

plans for a bombing raid of an oll refinery at Nevitas,

Cameguey Province, Cuba. A twin-engine Beecheraft reportedly

will be used and the raid is tentatively scheduled for the

night of December 14 or 15, 1963, fron Bimini in the

Bahama Islands.

Bosch reportedly has made arrangements through an

American businessman, who was a prisoner of the Castro regime

in 1959, to buy or rent a Beecheraft twin-engine plane which

is located at Orlando, Florida,

Bosch stated he is paying

an American pilot to transport the plane from Orlando to

Bimini on an ostensible pleasure flight. The American pilot

will be accompanted by his wife or girl friend. After landing

at the airfield, which is located on an island adjacent to

Bimini, the pilot and his wife will register et a hotel in

Dimini. The time of the departure of these individuals from

Orlendo is unknown to the source but he presumes it will be

the same day on which the bombing raid is scheduled or

possibly a day or two earlier.

on the raid. The source in this matter presumes that the bombs

will be carried in the boat together with the participants.

Information previously received has indicated that

the airport near Bimini is usually not manned by airport offielals

after sundown and it is possible for planes to take off and land

there under cover of darkness without

• being cleared or observed.

The source further advised that Bosch has issued

Instructions for the plane to depart Bimini at 1 a.m.; bomb the
