SUBJECT:

CLA COSA NOSTRA

AR

9'

It is noted that MI 623-CTE recently advised that JOE

ZAMMUTO is the current leader Of La sosa Nostra in the nocktore,

Illinois, area and that FRANK BUSCENt is the underboss 01

Rockford.

The attention of the Bureau is invited to my airtel

dated 10/4/60, captioned "Activities of Top Hoodlums, Chicago

Area, Anti-Racketeering", wherein information is set out as

received on 10/3/60, from CG 6343-C*•

It is noted that on that date source received

information as a result of a conversation between Chicago

top hoodlums JACK CERONE and FRANK FERRARO. It is noted

that at the time FERRARO was the underboss

of the Chicago

group. For the information of the Bureau, the following

conversation was set out in remyairtel:

CERONE:

I got a call this

morning FRANK... The boss'in

Rockford called me last night...So he calls me

last night and said he had to see me, so he stopped

by on the

way home and before I called you I called

West to see if

I could get a hold of MOE.

The above reference to MOE is obviously a reference

to Chicago top hoodlum SAM GIANCANA, the boss of the Chicago

Obviously when contacted CERONE attempted to put these

individuals in touch with GIANCANA as the boss.. Then when

unable to contact GIANCANA, FERRARO being "next man" or the

underboss, CERONE then placed the problem in with FERRARO.

The reference to Calumet City and to LA PORTE is

obviously a reference to Chicago top hoodlum FRANK LA PORTE

who is the organized hoodlum in charge of the area including

Calumet City, Illinois.

It is noted that when initially received the Chicago

Office interpreted the reference to JOE (ZERULLO) (Phonetic) as

being a reference to JOE ZITO inasmuch as the Chicago Office

was cognizant that ZITO was a hoodlum in the Rockford, Illinois,

area.

However, in view of the above information received from

MI 623-CTE it is now apparent that the reference to JOE (ZERULLO)

was in actuality a reference to JOE ZAMMUTO. This,

then, would

confirm the information recently obtained from MI

623-CTE.

The reference to JASPER as being the underboss is obviously a

reference to JASPER CALO.

CALO is a Rockford hoodlum who had

authority in Rockford until he recently returned to his native

Sicily.

BUSCEMI, according to the information received from

MI 623-CTЕ,

apparently has taken CALO'S place as the underboss

of Rockford.

The above telephone number checks out to a tavern

called George's Place at 2733 North Halsted in the immediate

vicinity of Diversey and Halsted on the Near North Side of

Chicago. It is noted that the license listed to J. W. MARINELLI

is obviously for an automobile registered to Rockford hooldum

JOE MARINELLI, also

known as "Gramps" and "Pops" MARINELLI, a

Rockford hoodlum.

It is of interest to note that FRANK FERRARO, being

the underboss of the Chicago group in 1960, was unaware of the

identity of the

boss and underboss in Rockford and had to request

as and unders

information from CERONE. This would be an indication that there

is no close tie up between the Chicago group and the Rockford

group.

It would appear obvious

that the information

provided

by MI 623-CTE and the information obtained in

October,

1960, by CG 6343-C* are in consonance with each

other.
