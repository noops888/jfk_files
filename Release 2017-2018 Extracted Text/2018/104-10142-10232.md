OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL

Friday - 26 August 1977

1 (Unclassified - DIC) FOLA Professor Alan Scheflin, University

of Santa Clara, called to appeal a Freedom of Information Act ruling on

MKULTRA made by Mr. Gene F. Wilson, our Information and Privacy

Coordinator. Professor Scheflin, who had obtained my name from

the Senate Human Resources Subcommittee on Health and Scientific

Research, wanted me to provide him certain materials on MKULTRA

so that he would not have to pay the reproduction costs quoted by Mi.

Wilson. I informed him that I was not authorized to provide material

to him and that he should discuss the matter with MI. Wilson. I

subsequently informed Mr. Wilson of this conversation.

2. (Confidential - DTC) LIAISON Delivered to Elliot Maxwell,

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff, and Walter Sheridan, staff

of the Senate Human Resources Subcommittee on Health and Scientific

Research, blind memoranda concerning the new find relating to

Projects ARTICHOKE and BLUEBIRD.

3. (Internal Use Only - DTC) LIAISON Stopped by to see G. Robert

Blakey, House Select Committee on Assassinations, and obtained from him

copies of FBI summary investigative reports on Select Committee

staff personnel and a copy of his signed secrecy oath. I hand-carried the

FBI reports to Robert Gambino, Director of Security, and the secrecy

oath to Lyle Miller.
