Between November 12, 1971, and November 28,
1971, a confidential source, who has provided reliable -
information in the past concerning solely domestic =
issues, reported that he had learned second hand, without
direct knowledge or independent confirmation, that ap-
proximately five to twenty United States prisoners of war,
possibly all Black, are to be released by the Government of
North Vietnam in January, 1972, and that a two/’month educational
and training session is to be conducted for their benefit by~-'.p
individuals from the United States. To date, this Bureau has‘
-no independent confirmation of the information furnished by this
source, The source informed that a group of 15 individuals,
11 student leaders from the East and West Coasts, and four :
American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) staff members, were to
leave on an eight’day Thanksgiving tour of North Vietnam to visit
United States prisoners of war. They were instructed by AFSC
Executive Director in Philadelphia William Moyer and Tony Henry,
Head of the Tenants’ Union, to attempt to learn the identities
of the prisoners to be released in January. Upon their return,”
if successful in learning their identities, they were to inform
AFSC,and Stoney Cook, Executive Director of the Southern Christian

Urban Coalition had resigned, or was going to resign,

in order to make the trip. The instructing group was to

be composed of both Blacks and Whites, and they were to

be paid, to some exfent, by AFSC.

The source learned that the overall purpose -

of the January-March educational sessions is to prepare

released prisoners of war for re-entry into American life,

and to prepafe them to obtain employment and to be self-

believes, though it has never been confirmed, that Cook,
after Czechoslovakia, traveled with five other Americans,
including Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis, to North Vietnam.

(geseuina

The source informed that-stoney Cook, along
with three other individuals in SCLC, Albert Sampson,
James Orange and Jame: evels, are active in foreign ss
liaison on behalf of with governments and organizations
promoting what they view to he, similar objectives.)

The above group began preparation meetings for
the January-March sessions on November 22, 1971, in a store
front building at 14th and U Streets, Washington, D.C.,
which has been used by SCLC for other activities in the
past. The group, as noted, is predominantly SCLC personnel, -
however; ATSC personnel were present during the beginning -
of these preparation meetings. However, it was not indicated
that these AFSC personnel would be going to Hanoi for the
Januasy-March sessions. The January-March sessions will be
sponsored, or at least co-sponsored, by the AFSC.

The above group left Washington, D.C. on November
24, 1971, for the Thanksgiving holidays, but planned to return
to their preparation sessions on November 29, 1971, to be held
in the above building at 14th and U Streets. The preparation
sessions are to continue for the next three weeks, with
axrture for Hanoi planned.for December 29, 1971.

and to exchange political views v.etween antiwar Americans and
North Vietnamese citizens, and t» learn the location of North
Vietnamese embassies and personnel throughout tie world so

that support for the legitimacy of the North Vietnamese and the
North Vietnamese position in the war could be rendered. The
source observed that the tour, whith was to extend over eight
days, Was obviously a propaganda tool for the North Vietnamese
Government,

A bulletin of a Philadelphia Quaker action group dated
9/2/71, reported that MOYER recently had led a Conference on
the New Society in Maine. Durin-the People's Coalition for Peace
and Justice national conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 6/25 - 27/71,
MOYER presented a paper entitled, "From Radical ~- Liberal to
Social-Transfermationist, New Demands for the Movement," and signed
by "BILL MOYER, 6/23/71, the Marco Non-Violent Community, 545 East
Sedgwick Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania." The source gained
the impression that the HONS has a director in Philadelphia, and
that there are directors in other US cities. Among others, MOYER
and Mrs. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., are on the Board of Directors.

The group, which was to leave on a tour of North Vietnam,
was comprised of four AFSC stafix members and 1] student leaders
from both the east and west coasts. The group met for planning
sessions during the weekends of 11/13 - 14/71, and 11/20 = 21/71.
The. planning sessions were led entirely by MOYER, Approximately
25 ~ 30 pecple attend the planning session on 11/13 ~ 14/71, of
which only 15 were to travel to North Vietnam, The rest of the
group appeared to be members of the NONS but merely observed the
planning session and did not participate,

The source gained the impression that all individuals
invited on the tour, upon their return, will work as paid staff
members for AFSC or NONS. The following individuals comprised
the tour group: 7

During the planning sessions MVYER remarked that all
tour participants were required to obtaii receipts for any
expenditures made on the trip because AFSC was not paying for
the entire trip, and justification of expenditures was necessary.
MOYER did not, however, indica:e who the financial backer for the
trip was.

»

The group was to spend approximately three days visiting
with the North Vietnamese Paris Peace delegation and then to fly
to Hanoi for four - five days in North Vietnam.

MOYER informed the tour participants that they were chosen
because of their past involvement in the peace and antiwar movements,
The source observed that none of the tour participants appeared
especially radical or militant, but were, for the most part,
"enthusiastic, energetic youths from upper middleclass families."”

:

The group was to take no supplies or medicines to US
prisoners of war-and in response to a tour participant's suggestion
that the names of prisoners of war be taken so that correspondence
with their families could be initiated upon the group's return,
HOYER responded that such was not the purpose of the trip and was
not suggested. MOYLR urged that the tour participants not deviate
from the above limited purpose of the tour.

The source noted that in association with MOYER the trip
was also being arranged by TONY HENRY, the head of the Tenants
Union, New York City. :

During,.the week of 11/15 - 19/71, STONEY COOK informed
the source, le both were in Chicago} that between January -
March, 1972, a series of workshops and conferences were to be
held in Hanoi, COOK informed that 20 - 25 people from the US
were to take part in these sessions, and he encouraged. the
source to participate also since it would equip him to further
advance in the civil rights and peace movements. He was encouraged
by COOK to attempt to remain in Hanoi when the above tour returned
to the US so that he would be there when the workshop group arrived
in January, COOK stated that it would be too expensive for AFSC to
pay the source's transportation on both the Thanksgiving tour and
on the later January tour, and airplane fare could be saved if the
source were able to stay in Hanoi. AFSC personnel were also
knowledgeable regarding this tour since one DEBBIE (LNU), AFSC
Chicago Staff Worker, also mentioned it to the source and encouraged
him to attempt to remain in Hanoi rather than return in order to =
save costs.

STONEY ‘CCOK said that "some ministers" would be attending
the January sessiors, and a high official of the Urban Coalition
has resigned or was going to resign to nake the trip. The January
group was to be cowposed of both blacks and white, and they would
be paid, to some extent, by AFSC. STONEY COOK was to be the
coordinator of the group, and for this period of time would he on

US peace movement individuals and North Vietnamese “counter parts”
since 1967 when he attended a peace conference in Czechoslovakia
attended by approximately 40 US citizens and a North Vietnamese
delegation, it is believed, though not confirmed, that COOK then
traveled with five other Americans including TOM ‘HAYDEN and RENNIE
DAVIS to North Vietnam.

The source informed that STONEY COOK, along with three
other individuals in SCLC, are active in toreign liaison on behalf
of SCLC with governments und organizations promoting what they view

to be similar objeciives. The other three SCLC individuals are
ALBERT SAMPSON, JAMLS ORANGE, and JANES BEVELS).

On 11/19/71, the source traveled to Philadelphia to
attend what he thought was a final pre-departure planning session
for the Thanksgiving tour. On the evening of 11/19 TONY HENRY
of the Tenants Union informed him “that it would be impossible for
the source to attend both the Thanksgiving tour and the January -
March sessions, and he encouraged the source to choose to attend
the January - March sessions since that trip would be longer in
duration and would be of more value to him in the civil rights and
peace movements. He was informed that the majority of the people
that would participate in the January - March trip would bel SCLC]
\psESonnek} peeple whom the source knew, and he was told this t¥rip
would be more enjoyable also for that reason, since the source did
not know anyone on the Thanksgiving tour. The source was unable
to make both trips because of the costs involved and the trans~-
portation expense.

While in Philadelphia the group was informed that there
would be one further pre-departure planning session to be held in
The Thanksgiving tour group left Philadelphia on the
moriing of 11/21/71, en route to.New York's Kennedy Airport,j where

and upon arrival they were met by a bus which transported the entir

‘farm appeared” to be a retreat of some type since it Was ‘located in
rural area about 50 - 60 miles from the airport, on which was
located a lodge, housing accommodations, and a separate dining hall

The group was informed that they were possibly to learn
the identities of several prigoners of war to be released by North
Vietnam early next year. A group of predominantly SCLC personnel
are to leave for Hanoi 12/29/71, to conduct educational and training
classes for these released prisoners of war, the.classes to extend
from January - March, 1972. If the Thanksgiving tour group is
successful in obtaining in advance the names of these prisoners of
war, STONEY COOK’ will conduct background investigation on them in
order to prepare for the educational sessions beginning in January.

ee



CG 105-32798

The educational sessions will be financed, at least in part,
also by AFSC, It 18 hoped that between five and 20 prisoners
will be released, and SCLC personnel and TONY HENRY hope that
the majority, if not all, will be black. WILLIAM MOYER did not
accompany the Thanksgiving tour as originally planned; the tour
wag under the leadership of ANDRE {LNU), AFSC Staff Worker from
Philadelphia, and three or four other AFSC Staff Workers.

In addition to the above listed names, the Thanksgiving
tour group was requested to question prisoners of war, if they
were able to interview them, as to what the prisoners of war
expected of government agsistance and government programs when
they returned to the US.

fhe source was informed that the overall purpose of
the January ~ March educational sessiens vere to prepare released
prisonerg of war for re-entry into American life, and to prepare
them to obtain employment and to be self-sufficient, ‘The sessions
were to be coordinated overall by STONEY COOK. ALBER3Y SAMPSON,

The above group left Washington, D. C. on 11/24/71,
for Thanksgiving holidays, to return to their preparation sessions
on 11/22/71, to be held in the above building at 14th and U Streets.
The preparation sessions are to continue for the next three weeks,
with departure for Hanoi planned for 12/29/71.

member of the US House of Representatives for the District of

On 11/26/71, the source returned to Washington, D. C.
to regume participation in the. preparation sessions. He informed
that Reverend ANDY/YOUNG was attempting to secure a monthly stipend

from CLO ter the’source during the period he was engaged in these
planning sessions,-and while in Hanoi. It is noted that the source
has not currently been a paid employee of SCLC, having terminated
that remunerative relationship in order to work solely on Chicago
based projects during the past few months. On 11/28/71, source
telephoned from Washington, D. C. informing that he was ordered by
SCLO to report to Atlanta immediately. Source has not bein
coutact with this office since that time. While the source has been
an extremely valuable asset in the civil rights movement, and in
providing information regarding black militant groups in the Chicago
area, he ig very much a non~political individual and as far as
ideology, dogma, or even intelligent political discussion is concerned
ton cource ig quite naive, This lack of political inelination and
education is well knovn to the individuals with whom he associates
dn SCLC and AFSC, and a question may have arisen in their minds
jregarding the desirability of including him on either of the above
j tours.

it is also possible that if the source has been put
back on the payroll of the SCLC, he has become involved in the
current ABERNATHY-JACKSON power struggle =

fhe source is extremely security conscious, consequently,
it will bo necessary to await his initiation of contact with this
office in order to‘develop full details of the latest developments.

The Movement for a New Society grows
from the recognition that the war in
Indochina has been but a sin
of a disease pervasive throughout global
society. To bring about real acd lasting
change, concerned people must confront this
distase whezever it exigis, suggesting by

the very means we use and the alternatives we
create the beginnings of a new society.

CONTENTS:
The MNS is a network of autonomous
groups committed to radical nonviolent social
change. Together we are developing an
analysis of the present system, a vision of a
etter world, and a sustained renvicler:(
struggle. Training is an important part of
our movement. The values of the new society
can become a part of our lives now as we
build community and alternative instiiutions.

THE MOVEMENT FOR A NEW SOCIETY IS

a network of collectives working fo bring about fundamental 3
nonviolent change. These small groups often arise from already oad
existing friendships or ties of workplace or religion. 4

The groups use a variety of names, depending on the basis of
their offinity. They seek to live the revolution now, experimen=
ting with simplified and shared lifestyles, even while preparing
for the emergence of a mess revelutionary movement.

The small size of the groups helps to maximize individual per- 7
ticipation and encourages indiviciual and group growth; their

participation in the Movement fer a New Society nehwork un»

ites them with a farger movement.

Curently groups and individuals are experimenting with the
Movement for a New Sosiety approach in Colifernie, Oregen,
Washingion, Wisconsin, Ohio, Hilinois, Minnesota, indiena,
Michigon, Kansas, Maine, New York, Pennsylvenia, Maryland,
Nerth Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. An exchange of ideas
and resources with the nonviolent movemeni in Britain, Japcn,
Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zeeland makes
MNS people hopeful of the prospects of a transnational network.

Sisters and Brothers,

With the election year come and gone, and the Indochina war changing fts shape, where are
movement people?

Where else, but working, innovating, reflecting, trying to build a movement for real change?

For many of us that's meant getting closer to the grass roots, The Movement for a New Society
is doing that. But there's no sense in getting isolated. For one thing, that's an invitation to
repression.

(We lost our non-profit mailing privileges because of a complaint about our news=
letter, Dandelion, advocating war tax resistance. Last week Keith Miller of the
Philadelphia Life Center was sentenced to two years for refusing induction. These
things add to our sense of the repression potential in this society.) -

ne way fo prevent isolation is to exchange information on what we're doing, Enclosed
is our newest effort to say what we're into.

Innovation js pretty important fo us. That's partly why some of us laid down A Quaker
Action Group == however useful it was in the 1930's, its structure and style didn't seem n=
novative enough for the 1970's,

So here you'll read where we are in our journey toward a more relevant, more attractive;
more human, and more radical approach to change. That journey is long. So we're also
nto self-criticism, conscious learning and changing of ourselves, serious confrontation with
our sexism and our old cliches which sometimes substituted for analysis.

We'd be glad for reactions and criticism from you, our comrades in the struggle. There's

a whole lot more wisdom tn the movement collectively than in the individual organizations
and activists.

Let's share -- and grow, and struggle, and celebrate!

ON A TOUR OF THE UNITED STATES, Danilo
Dolci, the famous Sicilian grassroots organizer,
was asked what he thinks of nonviolence,” He
replied, "I don't believe in nonviolence.” He
paused, and there was time for the audience to
wonder if Dolei had abandoned the nonviolent
epproach after so many years of commitment to
tt. Then he said, "I believe in nonviolent ac-
tion; | believe in nonviolent revolution." cat

Too offen the cell for "nonviolence" hos been a
call for peace at the cost of justice, an effort
to suppress the conflict instead of waging it. If
we acknowledge the gross injustice and the
powerful vested interests in this country, we
must also admit that conflict is necessery for
fundamental change.

Struggle begins In.a variety of ways. Conflict
may result from building an alternative institu-
tion which becomes so threatening that an Est=
ablishment agency tries to harrass or destroy it.
Or it may come when you stop peying your war

Those who profess to favor freedom,
and yet depreciate agitation, are
men who want crops without thund=
er and lightning. They want the
ocean without the awful roar of its
waters.. This struggle may be a mo=
ral one; or it may be a physical one;
or it may be both moral and physi-
cal; but it must be a struggle. Pow=
er concedes nothing without a dem=
and. It never did, and it never
will, Find out just whet people will
submit to, and you have found out
the exact amount of injustice and
wrong which will be imposed upon
them; and these will continue till
they are resisted with either words
or blows, or both.

~ Frederick Douglass, 1857

taxes or carrying a draft card. Your group may experience repression as it acts in solidarity with
@ local union strike or joins in a boycott action. Conflict nearly always comes when you carry out

a deliberate nonviolent campaign for change.

CAMPAIGNING FOR CHANGE

The first step in building a empaign for change is fo choose a goal which is consistent with your
analysis of the "big picture” of socici forces. There is little point in working on reformist goals
which have no relation to a long-range strategy for fundamental change.

Second, educate! Focus on the groups most likely to respond, and the groups whose action can
bring about the change. Sireet speaking and other diclogue methods can test your approach to

see if it is sectarian or itrelevani.

3B§3P8. DocId:32989700. Page 41 .



“" Third, organize! Connect the forces on your side to each other; catalyze new relationships which
go-beyond the one-dimensiogal politicking of the Old Order. Loge @ constructive program, pref=

erably connected to the issuM™Mou ore raising.

Fourth, negotiate! You need to meet the opponent fa :2-to=face really to know where things are;
roleplay beforehand, of course. This step can really <larify the situation for all parties.

Fifth (if your goal has not been reached), confront! Recwce the problem and solution to picture
form, so that no words are necessary in order to explain what the confrontation is about. (The

1960 sit-ins in the U.S. South were a good example of that.) The picture should show the gap
between a widely-held value and the perticular injustice. Take group actfon which paints the pic-
ture in vivid colors, The campaign should build to a crisis, in which the authorities are put ina
dilemma; if they allow the demonstration to go on, fine because the action fs dramatically pointing
up the situation of injustice. If they repress the demonstration, all right, because their repression
further reveals the violence on which the institution rests. If they accept the demand, you cele~

_brate.
FACING REPRESSION

The government's own force can work against itself, os in jiu=jitsu, when it is met indirectly. In=
stead of pitting guns against repressive violence, meeting the opponents on their superior ground,
the movement responds nonviolently. This often has two effects: it begins the process of demoral=
ization of the police and troops, and it discredits the government in the eyes of the public.

Voluntary suffering is dynamic when we can stand it without fleeing. For most people that requires
preparation. The repression we may experience in struggle is sharing in the suffering already ex=
perienced every day by millions of people,.but doing it for change instead of suffering because one

cannot get out of the way.

By changing our ideas about ourselves, by
developing a strategy we have confidence in,
and by training in direct action tactics, we
can get ready for open struggle. By joining
others in small affinity groups we develop the
solidarity necessary to face repression. The
MNS is a network of groups such as NRGs
(Nonviolent Revolutionary Groups) which
practice mutual aid at the "crunch" =~ at
the time when it is mest needed,

Campaigns for specific change frequently fail

- to achieve all their aims, Campaigns, like
alternative institutions, take part of their

» Meaning from the larger strategic context.
While Rosa Luxemburg may have been exag=
gerating when she said that revolutionists
would lose every battle except the last, her
point is still sound: when we have an overall
‘strategy for fundamental change, we need pot
be discouraged when we do not reach all our
campaign objectives.

Which is more important—national or local action?

Which is more important in a book—the paper or
the ink? Obviously there will be no revolutionary
nonviolént movement in this country without strong
grassroots organization and national struggle. No city
can be transformed unless the nation changes drasti-
cally. Our society cannot be changed neighborhood
by neighborhood,

The false dilemma results from short-sighted
strategy, which either projects a confrontation some-
where (e.g., Washington, DC) and then urges us to
drop everything for that, or digs into a neighborhood
somewhere and forgets about national impact.

Sound strategy links the levels in a multi-level
movement. The strategy underlying the NRG’s con-
nects national struggle to grassrcots organizing.

As an NRG nears the crunch ona significant issue,
resources from the network of groups and communi-
ties can join the struggle to make it successful, Some-
times, the struggle can achieve national or even
international proportions. As Martin Luther King Jr.
found in Birmingham and Selma, a national struggie
can grow out of local work, shaking the federal
government from a thousand miles away. ry

NEW THREATS TO HUMANITY are coming faster than old threats are resolved. War, racism,
dictatorship, sexism, exploitation, and hunger are stil with us, But now there is ecological
breakdown. .

_ Shall we try to escape, or to act? In the long run there is no escape. The problems will not go
* away. But the first reaction may be only a compiaint, a protest, or a scream of anger and pain.

These spontaneous reactions are like the symptoms in a body's nervous system which reflect dis-
ease or Injury. They alert the social body that something is wrong. They do not necessarily tell
us what is wrong or what to do about it.

»
To discover what is wrong requires analysis. To discover what to do about it requires, first, vision,
and second, strategies for change. From analysis, vision, and strategy will come actions which
are more than cries of pain, actions which are steps in our liberation,

Analysis is a continuing process. Action based on analysis tests our understanding and puts new
questions to us. Action and analysis should go together. If we insist on having a near-perfect
analysis before we act, we are likely not to act at all; such is the liberal paralysis often found
among academics.

in the summer of 1971 an Education and Action Seminar meeting in Philadelphia studied U.S. aid
to dictatorships. The Seminar soon found itself leading a campaign against supply of arms for Pak~
istan's repression of the Bengalis. Stimulated by the group's blockade of the harbor by canoes and
sailbouts, the longshoremen refused to load materials for Pakistan.

In these Seminars (which were developed by the MNS! Macro-Analysis Collective), each partic
ipant shores the reading she or he does with the other participants. In this way each individual
profits from a much larger amount of material than he or she could cover in individual study, The
seminar stresses not only the major elements in the present world crisis, but alternative possibil<
ities and strategies of change. Thus the groups get ready to develop campaigns out of a common
enelysis. (The manual, "On Organizing Macro-Analysis Seminars," is available for 75¢ from the
MNS, 4722 Baltimore Avenue, Philadelphia 19143.)

We believe in participation in developing analysis, vision, and strategy. The Movement for a New
Society has no party Tine, no leader who tells us what to think. On the other hand, the MNS fs not

a coalition which reflects the lowest common denominator of everyone who is concerned about change.
A consensus has been emerging among MNS groups on at least the ouilines of a common analysis.

OUR VIEW OF IT

At least six overarching forces shape this
world with an impact Felt even on the
neighborhood level: the ecological crisis,
corperate capitatism militarism, statism,
racism, and sexism.

ently, to be an unmixed blessing. After

profit of a privileged minorjime the planet has
been plundered of its preci @Presources and
* the ecosystem on which our very life depends
is befouled with industrial pollutants. Ecdn=
omic growth is the-altar before which much is
“sacrificed, “High consumption is offered as
‘the condition for happiness, The American
middle class level of consumption is the goal
for much of the world,

” That goal cannot be reached, Non-renewab=

_ le resources in metals and fuels are too limited
to allow such a consumption level. Food pro=
duction cannot be increased indefinitely. The
ecosystem cannot tolerate the resulting levels
of pollution. The population of the world is
already too large and is growing at an alarm~
ing rate.

The major organizers of exploitation in the
West are the corporations. Wealth and power
are concentrated in relatively few hands, even
in many societies which call themselves demo-
cratic. . The huge multi-national corporations
are already more powerful than all but a few
nations, and are still growing. They are res~
ponsible to no public; profits for their owners
are their first priority. These corporations,
most of which are linked to the American sup-
* erertich, dominate and impoverish the Third
World. Despite the immense wealth which
Flows into the U.S, from overseas, a ghetto

Support for such a system requires a huge mil=
itary machine, It is not an accident that the
United States is first in military might, and
trains and equips most of the armies and po=
lice forces of the world. Militarism in the
U.S. adds to corporate profits at home as
well as preserving corporate access to mark=
ets and row materials abroad, Militory con=
tracts, most of which are awarded without
competitive bidding, provide lucrative prof=
its for industry. Whole communities, large
portions of certain indusiries, and a vast la~
bor force have become dependent on the
maintenance of the military apparatus.

Exploitation and militarism are not confined

to capital gmeountries, of course. Huge ar=-
mies are fed at the border of Ching and

the Soviet Union, presumably not under the
orders of the bourgeoisie. Moscow has, in

the name of the proletariat, ruled harshly

over its own workers and those of Eastern
Europe; more than one workers! revolt has

been quelled by Russian tanks. The dis-

ease of statism -- whether the bureaucratic
centralism of the Soviet Union or the fascism a
of Spain, turns upside down the principle 7
that the state should serve the people,

Racism and sexism deny us the benefits of
equal life chances, deny us a common dig=
nity, and foster conflict among peoples who
should be allied against the power elites of
military-industrial societies.

Racism in the United States is strengthened
by unequal opportunities for education and
training. Minorities are at a disadvantage

in competing for jobs in a high unemployment
economy; that, in turn, reinforces patterns
of segregation in housing, churches, and
schools.

Rigid sex role definitions trap both men and
women. Women work hard and are supportive
to children and men, at a high cost fo them=
selves, Women are expected te defer to male
initiative and to limit their horizons to home
and child care. Men cre expected to be com=
petitive, stoical, eager to leave the nest each
morning to eam the bread. Persons of elther
sex who do not fit easily into these definitions
have hard going, and if they grow to love
members of their own sex, the discrimination
against them is compounded,

HOW WE SEE IT e eo

“There ‘is among MNS people a growing consensus on some of this outline. We see a new society
nei as a rigid utopia free of conflict, but a olave of life and joy and movement. {ft should value
women and men, blacks and whites, adults and children, intellectuals and manual workers equal-
ly. A variety of life-centered cultures will exist rather than a homogeneous mass. Access to
knowledge and art will be a right. Celebration and self-discipline will have new meaning in a
milieu which serves human liberation.

Human beings must five in harmony with the earth. This probably means a zero growth rate in the
near future for both industrial production and population, with the utmost use of recycled materials
and non=poliuting sources of energy. This will mean a decreased level of consumption for most
Americans, who have been using far more than our share of world material and energy resources.
Economic enterprises should be socially owned, decentralized, and democratically controlled,
Workers corirol is feasible when the enterprises are not enormous; participation by consumers

in decision-making is also important in some productive units. The object of production will be
social use rather than private profit. Alienation from labor will be minimized by sharing routine,
recstitive work, by participating in decisions about the product, and by co-ownership of the
enterprise.

‘The spread of incomes will be reduced, perhaps fo a ratio of 4 to | for maximum=to=minimum
incomes. In other words, there will be no rich as well as no poor, Basic needs for food, shelter,
madical care, education, and mass transport will be met free or at low cost. Income must be
eorned; it cannot come from the labor of others.

Desisions would be made by participative, democratic means. Politics would be based on the
fear~fo~faee community of citizens, extending upward fo the global level. Transnational inst«
ions will dsal with humenkind=sized functiens (such as the development of the sea~bed), but
is will be on deceniralizing all possible activities for the sake of democracy. Nation~
vitics as we now know them will cease to exist.

1 treining for nonviolent
: social change

LEARNING IS NOT NEUTRAL, It serves either to domesticate us, or to liberate us. Nonviolence
fraining fs a jearning process. Its goal is to facilitate human liberation -- to bring about fundamen~
tal and empowering change. e

Essential to this learning for change is the process of "consciousness-raising, “ which involves a rad=
ical change in the way we view ourselves as individuals in the present society, and as participants
in the historical process. For reality is not a set of conditions which surrounds us and controls us,
and to which we must resign ourselves, Gut reality is an ever-fransforming process which we are
creating. Until we recognize this power and this responsibility, we cannot bring about any funda=
re, mental change. But once we come to this realization and begin to live our new awareness, action
To to change the world becomes a necessity. ' canna

Nonviolence training can have a number of different emphases:

ft. PREPARING FOR DIRECT ACTION PROJECTS. Historically, this is how training is best known.

Participants in integration sit-ins organized by
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in the 1940s were required to attend evening workshops, ine
cluding discussions of fears and feelings and roleplaying of anticipated experiences. In the 1960s
"marshals" were trained in methods of nonviolent crowd control for large anti-war demonstrations in
Washington, D.C. By 1972, the emphasis had switched to "participant training" == preparing as
many participants as possiole to take responsibility. 7

Training for nonviolent direct action can now include choosing tactics, working out logistics, and
preparing participants. Preparation can include roleplaying, brainstorming, guerrilla theatre, end
other exercises. *

2, BUILDING A MORE SUSTAINED MOVEMENT, The People's Blockade of arms to Indochina be=

gan when a small group of individuals came toe
gether fo translate their concern about the war into an envisioned action. Brainstorming and strategy> _
gaming were especially helpful as they developed a campaign. Training for-larger numbers of parti~
cipants took place during the actual campaign, and helped it to grow nationally. Other groups have
found scenario-writing important in developing long-range strategy.

3. EXPLORING ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENCE {N OUR LIVES. Nonviolence training has played an
important role in the development

of neighborhood block safety programs in West Philadelphia, the highest drug crime rate area in the

sity. Through workshops, many residents found alternatives fo calling on police and to responding

to violence with violence. The new ways were not on ly morally more desirable, but also encbled

q

Olsen and Shivers, and the Trainers Kit (bibliography).

E9808 .. Docid: 329897, Page 47


them to feel more confideni neighborhood safety. The wor @ps also served an important
+ community=building function.

It Is important to be aware that "nonviolence" cannot assure a safe escape from a volatile situation
_,{nor can violence!), ‘but many positive nonviolent responses can present themselves if we insist on
telating to others as human beings, in spite of our fear or anger.

4, RAISING OUT LEVEL OF AWARENESS ABOUT OURSELVES AND THE WAYS IN WHICH WE
INTERACT. Observation and group dynamics exercises make us more aware of the dynamics
operating in groups, and more sensitive to group task and maintenance needs. Role= |
playing can make us more aware of our own behavior tendencies. Listening exercises and trust.games |
sensitize us. A careful evaluation and discussion bring out possibilities for change. ;

Alienation often results from rigid role expectations based on sex, race, or age. Training processes
can be helpful in enabling us to identify these feelings of alienation, understand them better, and
change them.

Nonviolence training has learned much from re-evaluation counseling, rransactional analysis, and
sensitivity training as reaffirmation of individual worth is incorporated into training workshops.

§. LEARNING ABOUT NONVIOLENT THEORY AND STRUGGLE, Past nonviolent struggles can

: inspire us to action, and suggest
approaches to change. Use ot nonviolent direct action case studies (of such actions as the Montgom=
ery bus boycott or Gandhi's salt campaign) have been important ways of learning about nonviolent
history in workshops and discussion groups. In Japan recently, training groups tried developing their
own strategy given an historical sitution, and then compared it to what actually happened, Training
exercises help to introduce nonviolent theory in the context of a real conflict situation.

6. SHARING SPECIFIC SKILLS. This could include leaming to facilitate training workshops them

selves, as well as running a mimeograph machine, chairing a meet=
ing, changing diapers, taking pictures, baking bread, and pthers. These tasks are a valuable part
of building a movement and a new society. When knowledge and responsibility are shared, the like=
lihood of drudgery or "meaningless labor" are lessened greatly. In this sense, training is a democra~
tizing process,

Training for nonviolent social change occurs through involvement in all aspects of the Movement for
@ New Scciety. Life Centers, which are now taking form in several places, offer not only partic~
ipation in a series of workshops dealing with various aspects of social change, but also involvement
in direct action, community, and alternative institutions. Training structures often become a regul«
ar part of sharing and decision-making processes, Shorter-term workshops are facilitated by several
training collectives, with areas of concern and amount of time depending on the interests and needs
of the group. Groups which have participated in nonviolent training have include university groups,
anti-war groups, organizational staff, high school students, church groups, and even a group of vol=
unieer nursing home visitors. -

.People who are working for radical social change offen feel insecure in
our present day world. Our values and priorities are being challenged
ond changed, Institutions are crumbling. The ecological crisis is
closing Inon us. Nuclear weapons are proliferating. Political
repression is around the corner. It is all so overwhelming and
confusing.

{

Activists need to come together to guard against despair ~= to help each other to i {
ery and to find the oecasions for laughter. We need to stimulate each others! imag- { j
inctions of what the’ future can be and of how we can get there. We need to simp= i
tify and organize our life together so there is time for confrontations that are needed . / !

if the old order is to fall. } ‘
Leaming to live contentedly without high consumption goes against the grain of f
ovr culture, but is possible in the context of community. Incomes can be cut if :
every family does not have to have its own laundry facilities, tools, automobiles, H

houses, etc. Concern for the ecosystem adds to the need for developing a simple \ 1
yet adequate life style. Simplifying our lives also means pruning our scatter of ac,

tivities to focus energy and fo provide time to be present to each other. Many peo= *
ple are finding their present occupations incompatible with their life goals and with
the way they like to live. As part of a community it becomes more possible to risk ¢<~ i
making radical changes in employment. , nee) 7

Several forms of community are developing within the Movement for a New Society network. In
some groups individuals continue to live in separate houses ds before, but interact with each other
an many levels. They study together and try to form a common analysis and vision out of which will
grew common action. At the same time individuals often share personal experience, problems and
joys. They offer practical help to each other (food-buying, child care, transportation) and may
even move into the same neighborhood,

Other people in the MNS are sharing homes together. A family finds another family, or they may ;
prefer to share with people who have no children of their own. Single, young people may fill a
house, or the commune may be composed of people of various ages. One house we know has ten
people ranging from age 16 to 58, with one married couple, one couple that is not married, and
six singles. 4

In some places clusters of communes and individuals form a wider community of people moving in
the same direction. When such clustering is deliberate the community can have a rich variety of
special interests, talents, temperaments and lifestyles -~ and yet maintain a feeling of belonging
and common causes

i: is not easy to build a community, of half a dozen people or of many times more. Most éf us are

ed to be individualistic and rather egocentric and have trouble coordinating our daily routines
those of other people. We are used to making decisions on our own and find it hard to remem=
tts check important matters out with our community. Some of us find it difficult to be open about
tacnelal situation or about the fact that we need help with personal as well as practical prob-

8308 . Docld: 32989700

We struggle to find ways to express disagreements and c:noyances in honest but helpful ways. For
those who live communally there are the ineviteble que:‘tons of housekeeping standards, child care,
expenses, and time devoted to development of a close corimunity os opposed to time devoted fo the
world “out there." And then, of course, there is the question of intimacy. As people leam to
share on a deeply personal level, it is safe to assume that sexual feelings arise.

CONFLICT 1S NATURAL

The first step toward solving problems in a community is fo recognize that conflict is natural and
inevitable, It may even be desirable in order for the community to grow in depth and commitment,
However, most communities that we know find it necessary to establish procedures for dealing with
problems as they come up. Regular meetings (e.g. weekly housemeetings in communes) are essen=
tial fo prevent annoyances from growing into problems, Also, without common planning there will
be misunderstandings and uneven sharing of work. Before community members feel comfortable
enough with each other to express negative feelings, short periods set aside for "gripes" can be use~
ful. In addition fo providing a safe way to express conflict, communities find it useful to do things
together that bring out their common joy and a sense of belonging.

We are excited about struggling to find the answers that are right for us af this time. Our vision of
a new society is helpful os a framework for finding better ways of relcting fo each other now.
Since our vision of the future includes egalitdrian and decentralized decision-making structures,
MNS communities do not develop around "gurus." Rather, conscious efforts ore being made to en~
courage full and free participation by everyone. Training in nonviolent action and knowledge of
group dynamics give us useful ways of dealing with probiems of leadership, reticence, ambiguity of
goals, etc. People with leadership qualities
are a valuable asset to a community, but such
ability should not carry any special privilege.

_ Since we ore working toward a non-sexist soc~
fety it is clearly impossible to divide the work
of the community along fraditional sex lines.

We are not trying to reverse the roles of men
and women or to erase leadership abilities or to
suppress individual differences. We are, how~
ever, pressing for equal sharing between men
and women of family maintenance tusks, of com=
munity participation and of breadwinning.

Communities often last only a short time, but
then longevity is not necessarily a sign of suc-
cess. A community will have succeeded if the
participants leave each other as more integra~
ted people than when they came together, more
able to ory and laugh and struggle with others,
ond with more skills and inspiration to carry on
the revolution.

Nonviolent revolution is a meaningless concept
as long as the present institutions have such a
stranglehold on our lives. Protesting 1. 7. T.'s
interference in the affairs of Chile while con~
tinuing #0 buy Wonderbread, calling for aca=
demic freedom while allowing the universities
to be funded by big business and the Desorte
ment of Defence, and talking about socialism
while not struggling to take control over work-
ing conditions, are futile gestures.

The majority of us through working and consum=
ing actively build the system os if exisis today,

Alternative institutions provide us with a way of
1

breatsing this stranglehold, enabling us io take
rower info our own hands, At their best they
clso provide us with working s oF what

life in the new society can be like.

Recent years have seen a great croliferation of
aliercative insiftutions. There cre few arcas of

either production, distribution, or service in
which experimenis are not being made.

Free universities in both the United States and
Europe offer courses the established universities
do not, and experiment with different metheds
of learning. An interesting alternative school
is the Scotland Road Free Schoo! in Liverpool,
England. {If is operated by the children and
community, and atiracts truants from the reg~
ular schools,

The Community Associates Printing Collective
is an MNS group in Philadelphia, Members of
the collective share skills and make decistons
by means of consensus. The Scott Bader Come

factory in England with gross sales in the mil~

- There con be few cities now without at least
one food co-op. At the Whole Earth Learning
Community in Madison, Wisconsin,. the small
poid staff is retated every six months so that
tore people can learn the skills. Former
staff are encouraged to carry the store's phil-
osophy to other areas,

The Neighborhood Repair Group in Philadel~
phia offers home repair and decorating ‘ser-
vices to the community as well as income to
its members. Both skilled and unskilled mem=
~. bers go out on each job so that skills are

shared. Vocations for Social Change groups
give guidance to people who want to work in
alternative institutions and in other non-ex-
ploitative types of work. In Britain, Uncar=
eers provides the same type of service.

Among the many other types of alternative
institutions are: child care co-ops, skills
co-ops, alternative pharmacies and health
care clinics, land trusts and credit unions,
crafts collectives and book co-ops.

To make work more human and satisfying, al-
ternative institutions must experiment serious
ly with organizational forms, collective work=
ing and skills sharing. To avoid hierarchy
and outside financial conirol only those who
work in them should take part in decision=
making. In food co-ops, for instance, each
member should share the work as well as the
benefits. Otherwise the co-op is merely a
money*saving club; this happened to many
of the older co-ops both in Britain and U.S.

To be ee. i relevant alternative institu
tions need to develop an analysis of estab=
lished institutions and a programme to chal=
lenge them, Alternatives people need to join
others in a movement for revolutionary social
change. Wherever possible alfernative insti-
tutions should relate to activist groups involved
in immediate confrontation campaigns and
should be flexible enough to free members to
take part in these. During the People's Block=
ade , the Ploughshares Co-operative Restaurant
and Bread Company in Washington State releas~
ed a member to take part in the Blockede and ~
supplied those taking, part in the action with
food.

Our ultimate vision is one in which alternative
institutions are able to produce, transport, and
distribute all necessary and useful goods. They
will meet more and more of our social needs.

In that way existing institutions lose their grip

onus. Long before we reach this stage the

existing institutions will feel threatened and
will try fo repress the alternatives. To prevent

this repression from being effective, alternative
institutions need to cooperate and support each
other. This is beginning in Madison, Wisconsin,
Hay cooperatives have set up a sustaining

und. :

The Movement for a New Society strengthens
this community of support and solidarity by
connecting alternative institutions with other
important aspects of the social change move=
ment. .

mins structure

What kind of structure should a nonviolent
revolutionary movement have?

Surely the traditional forms of organization,
from ITT to the PTA, will not do. They ex-
hibit the authoritarianism we seek to cure,
The goals of the revolution inust be incorp-
oratec into the very way it is organized.
Thus, the movement we build must be egal-
itarion and decentralized,

The Movement for a New Society is build-
ing a network of small groups working for
radiecl nonviolent social change. It is an
associction of participating groups rather
than individual members, All power with-
in the MANS fs based fn these groups; all
groups ere striving to become internally
egalitarian,

Although each group is autonomous, it is
responsible to the others in sharing ideas
and experiences, making decisions that af-
fect the whole network, and mutval aid in
times of crisis. The criteria for participat-
ing groups is acceptance of thesz responsi~
bilities, egaliterian internal structure, ag-
reement on strategic nonviolence, partic-
ipation in developing an analysis of the
present system and in projecting revolu-
Honary goals. :

The small groups, or collectives, are the

basic units in the Movement fora New So~
ciety. They are groups within which par-

ticipants share ffielr lives as well as work,
often living communally. These groups can
arise out of shared interest in a particular
issue, existing friendships, or other comms-
onaliiies. Six to twelve people is a good

size. When a collective becomes too large |

it can divide, aiding the proliferation of
MNS groups. :

Several different kinds of collectives have

”. LIFE CENTERS are larger Rvcrie with the primary purpose Sees effective social

revolution, participation in direct action projects, and the experience of living ina community
based on changed lives and changed values.

OTHERS: Innovative forms of collective organization are being developed to suit the function
t and heeds of particular groups.

fe
The Movement for a New Society Is still in formation. The network is being developed on several
levels -- local, regional, and continental += with each small group participating in the discussions
and decision-making at each level. Two ways this happens is in the network meetings and in the
more Informal gatherings sometimes called celebrations.
Celebrations are times of sharing joys and sadnesses, music, food, dancing, and discovering and

4 strengthening the spirit of community. They occur both locally and on a larger scale.

The first continental network meeting, involving MNS people from California to Maine to Florida,
was held in Madison, Wisconsin, in November, 1972. Regional and local network meetings are
either functioning or foreseen. Although the meetings are open to anyone, delegates from each
MNS group are expected.

Decisions in the network are made by consensus, a decision~making process that depends on a
group reaching general agreement rather than voting. By using consensus, people explore issues
more carefully and are more sensitive to each others' feelings; the decisions are more likely to
be mutually satisfactory. :

The “office” of the continental Movement for a New Society is presently in Philadelphia, and fs
maintained by the Continental Movement-Building Collective. This group has the particular task
of facilitating communication throughout the network, but also it promotes MNS ideas, stimulates
new groups to form, and raises funds. MNS.groups are working to share the responsibilities of the
Continental Movement=Building Collective. We hope that the collective's members will be repre~
sentative of the whole network, both geographically and in range of interest and experience.
Groups wanting to join the Movement for a New Society are referred to the MNS group geograph~
ically closest to them, for exploration of what is involved in joining the network.

Discussions on our siructure are continuing within the MNS; we are mindful of how we grow and the
influence of structures on us as persons. In common with others working for social change, we seek
to plant the seeds of democratic work and life now to increase the chance of an egalitarian new sosied
of the future.

Dear Friends:

The trips to Cuba planned for the past summer were postponed when

_. the Cuban government asked us to delay application for the visas until
late fall or early winter. The reason stated was that there were already .
too many Quaker groups coming to Cuba in the summer.

A Quaker action Group's Latin America Committee has decided not to |
proceed with the plans for the summer workcamp idea but we are still
planning to approach the Cubans with our proposal for a project to
challange the economic boycott on Cuba. While the specific arrangements’
and details of the project may ‘change during the negotiations with the
.the Cubans, the general idea is for a team of about 8 people to sail to
Cuba with a gift of medical textbooks or some other desired item.
Possibly, these Cuban people's organizations will send a gift to’ the
poor people of the United States. The team would bring the gift back
to be distributed by a poor people's organization here. As you can.

. tell, the plans are not detailed byt are open to discussion and change
_ when meeting with the Cubans.

A QUAKER ACTION GROUP (AQAG)
PLANNED DEMONSTRATION AT PENTAGON
ON FRIDAYS, BEGINNING JUNE 12, 1970

iS
On June 25, 1970, a confidential source,who ~’

has furnished reliable information in the past,made avail-
able the following leaflets relating to a schedule of events
and sponsors thereof in connection with a Campaign Against
Chemical and Biological Weapons Production and Weekly Actions
to demand the U.S. military withdraw. from Cambodia, Laos,
and Vietnam. The source advised that as of June 25, 1970,
there was no apparent interest among the peace groups in
Philadelphia, Pa., for a mass support of these campaigns
to take place in Washington, D.C. This source stated that,
although individuals from the peace movement have traveled ~
and will travel to Washington, D.C., to participate in these
events, there has been no indication that this participation
is sufficient to warrant chartering of buses. The support

for these actions are coming mainly from peace groups and
sponsoring organizations in Baltimore, Maryland and Washing-

i . ton, D.C. According‘to this source, the entire campaign is

a being organized and’ co-ordinated from 515 East Capital Street,

q Washington, D. pe Quaker Action Group, 20 South 12th Street,

q Philadelphia, Pa., has transferred gome of its office equip-
ment and employees to its temporary office located at 515

i East Capital Street in Washington, D.C.

WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ARTICLE 1?

The founding fathers recognized that wartime
circewestances could dangerously encourage the con-
centration of power in the chief execubive, eroding

the intended contrcl by the people's representatives. ,

So Article I gives Congress alone the power to de-~.
clare war, and beth Houses must eccnewt. Congress
likewise is given comtrol over war-supporting approe
priations, principally as a sheck to Executive,

We see the military effort of the United States in Southeast
Asia a& a delaberate genocidal policy against the Vietnamese
_peopie, Herbicides and defoliants have killed a large percentage
of crops resulting in starvation mostly among civilians, Gases.
‘CS, CN, DM. are used to flush whole villages out of their shelters
where they can be bombed, Studies have shown that poisoning and
extreme birth defects result from some of these chemicals,

WASHING TON WEEKLY ACTION

Each Friday at noon we plan to engage in Nonviolent Direct
’ Action at the centers of death in Washington, These actions
will involve civil disobedience as we seek immediate with-
drawal of U.S, military forces from all of Indo-China, In-
particular, we will be focusing our actions against the are
senal of Chemical and Biological Weapons which allow ,the -
aca United States to continue this war, CBW is especially ime
portant to our country’s imperialist foreign policy, as the
United States could no¥ continue its program of limited
wars in this atomic age without Chemical and Biological
Weapons, ea

"I want to emphasize that although I personally am opposed

to "close Dugway down". We do however, want to bring

to fuller understanding that the U.S. Army has been

only defensive techniques in CBW. Although you may feel

a note of antagonism, I assure you that our group does
“not want, to tear our country down, but rather to maintain

it's original idealism. :

QUAKER ACTION GROUP

A meeting was held September 2, 1970, at the Quaker
Action Center, which is directly across the street from the
University of Utah. The person in charge of the meeting was

height, slender, and having brown hair. It was alleged that he

and his female traveling companion were from somewhere in the

East and traveled around the country organizing demonstrations.

* . They mentioned that on one occasion they were trying to plant
a tree on Government property in Washington, when the Army
came in with guns and made the public think the "hippies" were
being brutally treated. The main topic of conversation was
chemical and biological warfare. They discussed Dugway Proving
Ground and indicated they wanted to have a demonstration
against Dugway Proving Ground sometime in the future. An
individual who claimed to be a representative of an underground
newspaper published at Dugway Proving Ground was in attendance.
They also discussed the possibility of demonstrating against the
Deseret Test Center at Fort Douglas, Utah. The demonstration
was tentatively planned for the week following September: 28, 1970.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on December 15, 1970, that
demonstrations are scheduled to take place on the island of
Culebra, which is used by the Atlantic Fleet of the United States
Navy for target practice, in late December, 1970 through January
and February, 1971.

! The source stated that activists’ in Culebra have

. organized various forms of resistance to the Navy. "Swim-ins"

* and "stand-ins" on beaches have attempted to stop the bombing and
shelling. Contacts have been made with United States radical
groups; in particular A Quaker Action Group (AQAG), This group
has been involved in illegal actions in the past such as the
a: sruptive actions in the Panama Canal Zone in March, 1969. Now,

i along with members of the War Resisters League (WRL), they are

I organizing an operation which has, as its ultimate objective, ,

the elimination of United States control over Culebra, The

"three dimensions" of this project are:

1. The "rebuilding of a chapel which the Navy
destroyed", : :

. 2, Staged péaceful confrontations with Naval
personnel in Puerto Rico and the Mainland urging them to “support
self-determination for Puerto Ricans and Vietnamese".

attend a meeting concerning the "Culebra" at 11 a.m. 3/11/71
at 515 East Capital Streét, Washington, D. C. (William Penn

new plans of action scheduled for 3/15/71.

The individual who called the Bureau had a definite
Spanish accent, spoke English well, and stated-he was an

Re: A Quaker Action Group ~

Culebra is undoubtedly the small island northeast
of Puerto Rico which is used as a target area by the U.S, Navy
and which has been prominently in the news ecently. The
"MPI" is most likely a reference to thé Movimiento Pro
Independencia de Puerto Rico ~ Puerto Rico Independence
Movement (MPIPR), a militant subversive Puerto Rican

proindependence organization.

-rescind Presidential Order 8684

Culebra,

nh contempt for refusing to leave the
arget area when ordered. I acted as a
‘epresentative of A Quaker Action
Group which sent a group of us to Cul-
*bra, but am responsible to myself for
what I did, as God is my judge. I acted
cnowingly in disobedience of those
ders because they seek to justify the
xpropriation of the land of Culebra
ind to restrict the free use of Culebra
by its people, and because they try to
protect the bombing on Culebra from
lhe accusing voice of humanity, which
as seen too much Killing.

“The orders of this court, and the
ences which seek to enforce those
prders, cannot hide from us the fact
that Culebra is used for the testing of,
eapons that destroy human fiesh in

ietnam and Laos and Cambodia. We
now, too, that men are trained here to
‘ill—not only men. from the U.S. but

anadians, British, Dutch, Venezuelans,
ominicans, and Brazilians learn to kill
eir brothers on the island of Culebra.
ut Jesus has commanded that we love
our brothers and be reconcited to them,

“My people, the Quakers, have al-
ways insisted that God is to be obeyed
and not men, and that we are neither
to be satisfied with the state of things,
nor with a promise of salvation in the
hereafter, but live as though the King-
dom were already here—without doing
violence or harming our brother. They
refused to own their brothers as slaves,
refused to kill or to pay taxes to kill—
for example, my, greaf-great-grand-
father, Lloyd Balderston, refused to pay
war taxes’ during the Civil War and the
government expropriated several of his
hogs. The Quakers have fallen with the
rest of the Babylonians, but there is a

~ yemnant which seeks to recall the voice

of Jesus to the Society of Friends, and I
think that we of A Quaker Action
Group seek to act for that remnant ané
to find once more the spirit of the early
Christians and the early Friends.

“In seeking the will of Jesus for our
time, some of us have been led to break
the laws of the United States—thus A
Quaker Action Group sent the sailboat
Phoenix to North Vietnam with medical

supplies in violation of the law against
‘trading with the enemy,’ and thus I
have refused to register for war, and
last year refused to pay the ten percent
war tax on telephones. Now some of us
come to Puerto Rico to learn about the
struggle for independence here, to join
in the struggle when it becomes ap-
propriate, as it did on Culebra, and
then to go home, to help the people of
the United States to understand that the
conduct of cur nation in Puerto Rico,
in Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia, in
Okinawa, and in the United States it-
self, is an offense to God and to man.

“T call upon the people of the United
States to repent of these wrongs, to turn
away from them—to leave Puerto Rico

\éree and unassociated, to let free the
other vast areas of the world we have
subjugated. We must rediscover the
humility, the willingness to take suffer-
ing upon ourselves rather than inflicting
it on our brothers and sisters, and the
faith of our Lord Jesus who told us to
take all that we have and give it to the
poor, to do unto others as we would
have others do unto us, and to love one
another, even as He loved us.”

“70 DISOBEY Tye LAW OF THE EMPIRE. |;
eieiiniciee Run Berrios

o disobey the law of the empire is to obey the law of the country. We
ave disobeyed the law of the empire.

We acknowledge that we have intentionally violated a Federal order
nd that we have interrupted the Navy bombardment of Puerto Rican territory
y the U.S. and allied navies. Our action is not isolated: It is part of

patriotic movement directed toward eliminating arbitrary and unjust fed- -
ral authority over Puerto Rico, including the power of this tribunal which”
omes from the-Congress of the United States and not from the people of
uerto Rico. : . .

By violating this federal order, we exercise a profound moral respon-
ibility as men and a deeply-felt patriotic responsibility as Puerto
‘icans. Moreover, we are announcing our intention of disobeying whatever
‘ederal law whose violation we consider necessary to fufill our responsi-
ility as men and as Puerto Ricans.

From the moral point of view, as men who believe in freedom, our
udge is our own conscience. * For us, as Jose Marti said: "A man who con-
vents himself with obeying unjust laws and who permits men who mistreat the
‘ountry in which he was born to set foot there, is not an honorable man."
s‘ecause we are honorable men we are violating the order of this court.

‘efore the tribunal. of ‘our conscience, an honorable man is always innocent...

From the patriotic point of view, in the republic (the U.S.) law is
weder; in the colony (Puerto Rico) law is tyranny. Order is necessary to
1uman life; -tyranny makes human life impossible... :

From the point of view of our civilization, the disobeying or violation
of immoral and unjust laws has its foundation in the most noble aspect of
yur inheritance. Isaiah, in violation of the laws of his epoch, walked
iaked and unshod for three years among his people protesting the imperial
sra of Ethopia, Egypt and Syria. Daniel preferred to disobey the mandate
of the emperor of Babylonia and to be sent to the lions den rather than
sransgress the laws of his,conscience. And Christ taught us that the law
yhould not be obeyed when the juridicial system is against man. "The Sabbath
yas made for man and not man for the Sabbath." True to his work, Christ
violated Jewish and Roman laws...

It is within this noble tradition that, humbly but firmly, we have dir-
acted our actions.

Long Live Free Puerto Rico!

Culebra@hd Goliath

U.S. military operations are so vast,
and Culebra so small, why does AQAG
focus on this microcosm? i :

|
Since early in the century, after U.S.
"liberation" of! Puerto Rico from
Spain, the U.S. has used large parts o
of the islands for military purposes.
‘In World War II Culebra was made a >
“Naval Defensive Sea Area."

In the early '60's maneuvers and tar-
get practice in Culebra were extended
as the U.S. became further involved
in Vietnam. The Navy agreed under

- pressure im early 1970 to restrict

bombings around the town of Culebra,
but intensified exercises elsewhere
around the island. Fishing dropped
off; accidents occurred. Inaccessi-
bility of beaches, inaccuracy of shel-
ling notices, loud firing noises late
into the night causing anxiety in
children -- all of these culminated

in the beginning of. direct action.

In January 1971 the Navy negotiated an
agreement with Culebra's mayor prom-
ising in effect that it would not try
to take over the whole island. While

‘this was a victory of sorts for Cul-

ebrans, it did not end their being
part of a bombing target.

AQAG became interested in the struggle
in 1970 and after consultations with
Culebrans and other Puerto Ricans,
sent a team to express our support

as Statesiders and our realization
that we too are oppressed by the

U.S. Navy.

se < ‘ (215) LOcust 7-3150. Cable, AQAGPHILA,

April 1971
Dear Friend,

We are a fermenting community of Quakers, trying hard, as William Sloane
Coffin urges, to become "twice as militant and twice as nonviolent."

May we introduce ourselves to you?

You may have heard of some of our international projects. In 1967-68 we
sailed the Phoenix with medical supplies to North‘and South vietnam.

In late 1968 we participated in a multi-national pacifist protest of

the invasion of Czechoslovakia--AQAG staff member Bob Eaton was arrested
in Budapest but freed, only to be imprisoned in the U.S. for draft resis-~
tance. In 1969 we demonstrated at Fort Gulick in the Panama Canal Zone
against U.S. military and economic domination of Latin America. Now we
join the Culebrans in a common struggle against the U.S. Navy; the current
report is enclosed.

Imaginative direct action tactics are needed at home as well -as abroad. In
spring, 1968, a number of us were arrested on the Capital steps in Washing
ton with Rev. Ralph Abernathy, during the Poor Pebple's Campaign. One yea
later we were back on the Capital steps, reading the names of the Vietnam
war dead. The initial AQAG team was arrested, so we reappeared the follow+
ing week to resume the reading. After more arrests, U.S. Congressmen bega
to join us in civil disobedience, helping to bring Vietnam into public

de vate again.

OUR GOAL is community -- on a local level, and on a world level.: Our staff
representatives in Europe and our Latin America actions help us to outgrow
our American skins and to build the transnational provement sO badly needed
to stop the rampaging military~-industrial complex.

OUR MEANS are nonviolent ~~ from resistance to revolution. AQAG members i

prison remind us to deepen 2s well as to broaden the movement, to be God's
. vevolutionaries in life style as well as political action. Our participati

in the mass anti-war movement is colored by this concern for deepening?

we have been a center of development of training for nonviolent action,

and we are Winding up a two-year study of the American system and. how it

can be fundamentally transformed ey nonviolent means. . .

Would you like to be in touch with us? If so, we hope you will return
your name and address ~- and a generous check if possible. .

proféssor of psychology at GSC, Atlanta, had been hired as
coordinator of he Interpersonal Relations Program of the
Southeastern Education Laboratory, Suite 221, 3450 Inter-
national Boulevard, Atlanta, about July, 1968, This
source described Wright as "extremely anti-United States",
and said “he continually downgraded the United States in
his discussions around the Southeastern Hducation Laboratory
Office, also that he openly stated that Cuba should invade
the United States, also that he frequently disseminated
written material around the office, which material was
eritical of the United States.

This third source furnished a copy of @ letter
purportedly written by Fred H, Wri Ph.D., associate
professor of psychology,to then Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, same dated January 15, 1968, in which letter
Weight mentioned his previous employment with the Community
Relations Service of the Gustice Departmest, and of his
having observed some actions of Mr. Clark "during the
faithful days of the Selma to Montgomery March shortly
after I joined the Community Relations Service". in this
letter, Wright indicated that it grieved him to learn that
some of Mr. Clark's energy would "now" be cevorted to the
prosecution of "people who do not believe war, particularly
this war, is the Lord's work", Wright also indicated in
this letter furnished by sourc nat he wanted to "confess"
that he had publicly spoken o he military presence of the
United States in Southeast Asia as immoral, unjustified and
cour’ productive to the interest the United States,

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

* students for a Democratic Society; commonly

known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention

held during June, ‘1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. From an
initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist~-

Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant .
during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create

a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement

in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position

to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up

the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America

‘with thé blagk liberation movement in the United States.

All major factiongewithin SDS embrace Marxism-Leninism
_and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North Vietnam
as countries leading the worldwide struggles against the

United Statqs. However, the Soviet Union was regarded as
imperialist and with the Communist Party, United States of
America, "revisionist" in nature.

SDS operated under a pn constitution which
celied for an annual Netionai Conv on (KC) snd
National Council meetings wherein progr
and debated. ‘Three n
vith a National Interim Committee to run the organization,
Regional offices and college chayters elected cclegates to

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH ‘MOVEMENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth

i Movement II (RYMII) faction of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) held a national conference at Atlanta, Georgia,
from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it was
decided to form a new organization to be known as Revolutionary
Youth Movement (RYM), characterized es a mass anti~imperialist
youth organization, said organization being proposed as
separate and distinct in form and content from SDS. The
"Principles of Unity" adopted by the conference ‘included a
struggle afainst white supremacy and male supremacy; fights
against imperialism, ,anticommuniém, fascism and oppression
of youth; and support of the right of self-determination of
2ll “opprossed natious," alsd. support of the right of, all
"oppressed and exploited” peoples “to armed scit-defcnse."
it was agreed that RYM would .not be a Marxist-Leninist
organization; however, souree said this was cecided in order
to indicate an organization broad enough in form to be
acceptable to everyone. A temporary Hational Steering =
Committee (NSC) made up of eight females and two males wag
.eLlected to govern RYM until national officers could be
elected during the Spring of 1970.

2 ’
RYM publications have listed the RYM National Office
(NO) at Post Office Box 5421 and Post Office Box 77012 C,
both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that
the NO has no office space but would probably be considered as
-located at Apartment 27, 1067 Alta Avenue, Northeast, Atianta.

Second source advised that women dominated the
founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC
meetings to the point that "women's Liberation" has apparentiy
become the RYM's principal issue - also that RYM's poor
‘financial condition has resulted in its failure to publish
@ paper. During early 1970, RYN has decided to cater to
the working class rather than youth, since the potential for
social revolution lies in workers. .

From: Marise Pols SP La, a OMFS 7 /

The Citizens Confurence on Ending ‘the War in Indochina will as we all hope
have an impact upon the thinking of the people in the towns and cities acvoss
the United States from which the participants come. In that sense your will-
ingness to agcept Speaking engagements and/or radio and television and news-
paper interviews will be very valuable. ~
~~

The following suggestions! mi ght be helpful in this regard,

1) The trip will be first announced in a news release sent to major

newspapers, radio stations, etc. across the U.S. for release on

Sunday, February 21. At the same time the contact person in your area will
be sending copies of the release to local reporters, etc. You may possibly
hear From members of the media between February 21 and your departure. It
is important that the media will get the names of the sponsoring oxrganiza-~
tions, the dates of the flight, etc. You wight also want to express your
expectations of the Conference as an individual. You may also be esked to
make appointments for talks and interviews on your return.

2) It would’ be a good idea if the group would choose its own spokesman
to handle media contacts as well as a spokesman for a national press
conference. to be held, the day after arrival back in the States. c

3) Another possibility is to schedule a brief news conference in co-
operation with others from your area upon your return in your home-
town,

4) In case the group has arrived at some joint statement for the press, -

patatseasti it would be a good idea to have copies with you for your interview.

5) If by any chance a member of the national media (C.B.S., Time, Look,
etc.) approaches you directly, it would be best to telephone Margarct.
Bacon, AFSC's director of information, collect so we can be informed and. hope-
Tully“continue to coordinate the flow of information. The AFSC's telephone
number is 215-563-9372.

Citizens Conference on Ending the War in Indochina
February 25, 1971 News Release - 2

-

Meetings are also being arranged with representatives of the National United
Front of Cambodia, the Laotian Student Union and various independent South Vietna~
mese groups opposed to the war (including puddhists, Catholics, students and groups
supporting dissident renbers of the Saigon Administration's National. Assembly.)

Mr, Allan Hrick, national program director of the FOR, said that in addition
to meting with official govérnment representatives at the peace talks "we are
anxious to learn a great deal more about the recent upsurge of civilian resistance
to the war in the large cities of South Vietnam, We want to reach a better under=
standing of what the Vietnamese people themselves are struggling for."

The Rev, Richard Fernandez, director of CALC, indicated that "the conference
will come at an extremely propitious moment given the United States second invasion
of a sovereign country (Laos) in less than eleven months. Mr, Melvin Laird," the
clergyman continued, "thas told us that the invasion of Laos doesn't represent a

widening of the war -- we are interested to see what both Asians and Europeans see

in this new move,"

Clergy and Laymen Concerned (CALC), and Fellowship of
Reconciliation (FOR). They departed JFK Airport in New York
City about 10:00 p.m. on Wednesday, 3/3/71, aboard Icelandic
Flight #200. They arrived in Luxemburg about 2:00 p.m. on
3/4/71 and boarded chartered buses to Paris, a trip of about
five hours, The participants were lodged in the Hotel
Garnier and the Modern Palace Hotel.

ALLEN BRICK, an associate executiveof the FOR,
acted as the group's spokesman.

On Friday, 3/5/71, the delegation met at the
Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) Information
Bureau, 39 Avenue Georges Mandel.

ALLEN BRICK set out instructions on conduct and
cautioned them not to inflame or irritate friends from the
North or say anything that might force them into a bargaining
position. It is their policy that no individual discuss 7
these matters with members of the press. JOAN,.HULL, from
New York would serve the press representatives and she
would furnish them only sufficient information to relieve
their anxieties.

CANDY PUTTER of Philadelphia was critical of
Ambassador DAVID BRUCE for seeing only a delegation of 12
and not the entire group. She was instructed to contact the
U.S. Embassy for reconsideration.

XUAN THUY, Democratic Republic of Vietnam,
extended greetings. He related details of Vietnam history,
their struggle with the French. The United States wanted
the French to continue with the war but they could not so
the Geneva Conference was signed in 1954. These agreements
recognized the independence, the sovereignty, the unity,
and the territorial integrity of Vietnam.

The Vietnamese want the war ended. As for POWs,
there can be no release until after the war. The DRV pro-
posed a deadline of 6/30/71. XUAN THUY stated he mentioned
this proposal to Ambassador BRUCE but he did not agree.

President NIXON claimed the invasion of Cambodia -
was just and now he says the same of Laos. Americans will
be fighting wars for a long time. The widening of the war
will only serve to hinder the withdrawal of troops. Since
both of these have failed, NIXON will perhaps plan to
invade North Vietnam. The Vietnamese want peace to
rebuild their country. Once peace isobtained, North Vietnam
will continue on its socialist path, while South Vietnam
will follow neutralism,

The Vietnamese with the support of the Laotian
people and other socialist countries are determined to con-
tinue the fight until they have general independence and
freedom.

On Saturday, 3/6/71, Mme. BINH addressed the group
at the PRG Information Bureau and stated she hoped the
delegation during a limited time would be able to view
their attitude and their position. She wished to bring -
about the clarification of relations between the Vietnamese
and the American people. Few nations in the world have
undergone such dreadful trials as the Vietnamese in order

to defend freedom and human dignity.
is to live freely on their own soil.

Their greatest desire
She claimed the NIXON

administration with its superiority of weapons has sown
death, destruction, and hatred on their soil. The American
GIs do not consider the Vietnamese as human beings and they
kill men, women, and children.

The speakers from the Laotian Student Union claim
the army in South. Vietnam is a puppet army of the United
States. The United States should end the war in Vietnam
and let the Vietnamese solve their own problems.

The morale of the South Vietnam and U.S. Armies
is low. The Laotians want the Americans out of Laos. These
speakers reviewed the history of Laos and related the plans
of invasion on Route 9 to cut the country in half and then
continue north. The United States has dropped more than
3,000 tons of bombs on Laos everyday. The American
imperialists have tried to shame the friendship and
solidarity between the Laotians, Cambodians, and the

Vietnamese. The patriotic forces in Laos are winning more |
and more victories.

The Black Caucus of about eight members was
formed and planned to submit resolutions at the news con-
_ ference on Monday.

On Sunday, 3/6/71, THICK NHAT HANH, head of the
Buddhist delegation in Paris, ‘claimed that all warring
parties want a cease fire but they say it must be negotiated.
The Vietnamese people want an active end to the killing and
destruction. The Saigon Government opposes a cease fire
for they claim it would benefit the Viet Cong. The United
States talks about a cease fire but only for the sake of
propaganda.

HANH stated the U.S. Government can stop this war
and put an end to the killing. The American people can
exert pressure but the pressure can only be effective if the
people are united. He urged them to unite and form a strong
coalition. If it were in his power he would withdraw the
troops now instead of waiting for a specified date. - .

The group was also addressed by Father NGUYEN,
DINH, Movement of Catholics and Service of the Nation in
South Vietnam; Mde. PHAN THI THIEN TU representing the
Committee of Opposition Forces in South Vietnam; and THICK |
THIEN CHAU, a Buddhist Monk. Ue Fititle PRGFESS OMe

which included WILFRED BURCHETT, JACQUE DE CORNOY, SERGE
THION, Professor JOHN CHESNEAUX, Miss MARY MC CARTHY (U.S.)..
and PEGGY DUFF, International Confederation for Peace and
Disarmament.

A panel of seven represented the delegation and
met with officials of the press. Although BRICK was the
spokesman, STAN DALE, WDAI Radio, Chicago, I1l., was the
most outspoken and’ fe eriticized the press for not telling
the truth to the American people.

The group was critical of DAVID BRUCE, U.S. Peace
Negotiator, for limiting the delegation to 12 whereas XUAN
THUY and Mme. BINK addressed the entire group. Also, the
use of tape recorders was not permitted at meeting with
BRUCE although PRG and DRV permitted their use.

Mys... ALLIDES CHRISTOPHER,. Camden, N.J., stated ‘the ~
Afro-Ameri@ans have ‘fought exploitation and oppression for
more than 350 years. Because of their historical back-
ground they initimately identify themselves with the
struggle for self-determination in which the Vietnamese
people are now fighting. They fully understand the racist
nature of the war in Indo-China as well as death and degrad~
ation imperialism brings. As long as America wastes her
economic, technology, and human resources for the destruc-
tion abroad she cannot meet her demands at home. As long
as the Indo-Chinese or any society in the human race is
subjected to American oppression, we will.not be free.

Ambassador BRUCE met with delegation and Ambassador
PHAM DANG LAM of South Vietnam met with group. LAM asked
American help and assured them U.S. assistance is needed. .
South Vietnam has exerted efforts to make certain U.S.
soldiers can return homebut this would be only if Hanoi
withdraws its troops from South Vietnan, Laos, and Cambodia
as troops of aggression. The communists claim they want a
political settlement which begins with the overthrow of the
elected government of South Vietnam. A settlement by the
communists would not settle the problem as the people would
live under a forced rule.

In his own view peace is nearer than most people
think. Films depicted progress in South Vietnam.

Those who met with Ambassador BRUCE reported back
to their respective groups on what transpired. BRUCE
. reportedly stated a date of complete withdrawal could not
be set. It would run the risk of not having a fruitful
negotiation. The South Vietnam government is legal, it
exists. XUAN THUY is a propagandist and the Viet Cong have
no power. BRUCE would not admit Saigon is a puppet govern-
ment and he did not believe the POW problem would be \
settled if a withdrawal date were set.

: BRUCE also reportedly stated that Mme. BINH has
no official status. The delegates attempted to discuss

Vietnamese history with him but he refused. The delgation
claims he is not aware of their history and does not care.

Mr. MILLER of the U.S. Embassy, Paris, Francé,
explained the negotiation picture of the United States.
The United States made proposals for a peaceful negotiation
and the North Vietnamese turned them down the very same day
and even objected to discussing them. North Vietnam wants
the United States out of Vietnam by June 30th.

The North Vietnamese refused to talk directly to
the Saigon Government. The South Vietnamese refused to
negotiate with the PRG. The war continues in Indo-China .
solely because Hanoi desires it. .

A question-and-answer session followed.

The participants boarded buses at 6:00 a.m.,
traveled from Paris to Luxemburg, and departed Luxemburg
via Islandic Airlines, and arrived in New York about 7:30
pem., Wednesday, 3/10/71. Some participants planned to con-
tact their respective senatorsad congressmen in Washington,
D.C.

There are no definite plans for future action but
they were urged to bring pressure to bear on Federal law-
makers, state and local officials, and have them urge

eu c Tom opened the meeting “by suggesting ‘that before the Committee meets again
Bits members should be officially confirmed by the Philadelphia AFSC, Also, Tom said
Athe Committee itself should now assume the responsibility for appointing new menbers.
8, Stewart brought the Committee up to date on the "Jefferson Airplane" trip to
({Paris. The plane will bring about 35 Americans to Paris from March 3-10 to meet
Fiand discuss with Vietnamese there the conditions for ending the war. They will also
meet with U.S, officials there if the U.S. agrees. The pedple on the Airplane trip
“ will then be able to return to their communities to discuss what they have learned.
This will also be tied in to organizing around the People's Peace Treaty.

In relation to the Committee, Stewart noted that when the AFSC office was
moved from Houston to San Antonio, the idea was that programs should only be atiemp-
ted in maybe 3 cities instcad of trying to work in 8 or 9. Commitees would then be

- set up in 3 cifics cnd there would be no Area Committee as such; there would, how-
ever, be an adv! wey group which would be made up of people from thoughout the
Area and which woil:. meet once or twice a year.

The committe ageced with Stewart that this was a good general set~yp and
that plans should be made to put it into practice, Stewart noted that the San ,
Antonio AFSC office was more of a "movement'-type office but that all AFSC programs
in the Area do not hay: to be these type of prokrams. Specifically, there are poss-
abilities of working in Houston with with a more liberal BEM- ~type constituency. Tom
noe that he would be comfortable doing this but would have to spend more time in

Houstpn than he is presently doing. The rest of the staff felt that if Tom were to
do this, they could handle the San Antonio AFSC office. It was noted that Mary Jensen
was voluntarilly handling all bills at the present time.

nj. Adelaide ‘Lover,

UNDER OLD BUS@NESS, it was noted that the status of the coffee house proposal
submitted in request of funds to the AFSC Youth Affairs Division had for the moment
been turned down but that a new request would be submitted,

ALSO UNDER OLD BUSINESS, Hennacy House is running with some 15 permanent

people. “All are contributing some $10-$15/month to keep the house above water
financially.

The situation in Bexar County Jail was discussed again with the Committee
approving Staff Work being done‘in this area, Stewart noted that often radival
action combined with support from the liberal establishnent~fype community could
force changes to be wade. Efforts, he said, should probably be made on both fronts,

Ira Peine reported on the War Tax Resistance Rally that was held inAustin
in Lecember and also on the protest held in front of the telephone compnany the
first Tuesday in Februray. A War Tax Committee has been formed which will hole morithly
rallies at the phone’company. People will publicly refus¢ to pay their telephone tax
turning the money over t@ a group working to help the conmunity in some way. (Last
month's money went to the United Farmvorkers. ) 7

John Stanford suggested the idea of a local People's Coalition for Peace
and Justice in order that all groups working for various human rights can get the
maximum of support and cooperation. John will pont out a plan for implementing

the coalition. FIDENTIAL

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP),
also known as
Black Panther Party for Self Defense

According to the official newspaper of the BPP,
the BPP was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by Bobby G. Seale, BPP Chairman, and Huey P.
Newton, Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"
regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end
oppression of the black people. Residents of the black
community are urged to arm themselves against the police who
are consistently referred to as "pigs" who should be killed,

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968,
had an article by the then Minister of Education, George
Murray. This article ended with the following:

"Black men, Black people, colored persons of
America, revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The
only culture worth keeping is revolutionary culture,
Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power.
Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had
an article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

David Hilliard, Chi of Staff, BPP, in a speech
at the San Francisco Polo Fieid on November 15, 1969, said
"We will kill Richard ixon.”

David Hillierd, in the "New York Times," issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct overthrow of the government by way of force and
violence," - :

"The only way to make this racist US government
administer justice to the people it.is oppressing,
is...by taking up arms against this government,
killing the officials, until the reactionary forces...
are dead, and those that are left turn their weapons

judgement against the number one enemy of all mankind,
the racist U. S. government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta

press interest in their press conference scheduled Monday,
Merch 8, 1971. The participants should not be persuaded

from their focus on this conference, but press interviewers
will be trying, to approach them to pet a statement, Larly ‘
statements could be prejudicial to the pfroup, and it could

skim the cream off any important story that mirht berin with
Nonday's press conference. The importance of their focus

is on the period when they return home and what happens there.

Similerly, if those <t the meetinr were epprosched and felt

BRICK further stated thet the rroup wes meeting on
that dey under very unusuel circumstances. ‘The atmosphere
has become even more strained between the U. S. Government
end the North Vietnamese es of yesterday when President NI‘ON
made a speech and the recent news released in effect threatening

very frécious about this. We are here to have an interchénre

in a questioning atmosphere to rive our point of view. This
does not mean presentations from individuals. This does not
mean a prepared presentation. Certainly, it doesn't mean
anything that hasn't been discussed already. Any stronr
presentation, no matter how well conceived nor how beneficial
would jeopardize the atmosphere existing that morning. Should
enybody have any questions, they should contact him; but, due
to the time pressure, now wes not the time.

LICK stated that some people heve came to Paris
efter having comminiceted with wives end relatives of
prisoners of war, people reportedly held in Horth Vietnam
or Leos. That 4g very naturel efter having sone communice tion
from people in the States with POW relatives or POW wives.

It would be quite appropriate in discussion periods to raise
questions about the POW issue and how our Vietnamese friends
spproach that issue und what it means to them. It would, by
no means, be appropriate to read the presentations or forward
plans to them either in rroup sessions or outside of frour
ne about how we think they should relate to the POW
ssue.

BRICK stated, "I have to say this very flatly to
you that at this time we are here under the auspices of three
peace orranizations and I would beg anyone who has conceived
plans along the above lines to discuss then with the staff
first."

Ch. Toy C pupesh of Philadelphie remarked that she hoped
everyone hintéedived the revised prorran zt the hotel. She
assumed they had since they had all come to tiie rirht plece,.
She did not desire to revicw the entire prorram for the veel
but, due to the tine pressure, did want to discuss 5 few
metters with them. She stated they will héve « presentetion
with lir. XUAN THUY and they will-spend the entire dey at that
plece. Ianch will be brourht in by some friends and French
students and /Mmericens in Paris, Thet eveninr films will be
shown berinning at 8:30 p.m. and continuinr until 11 o'clock.
She explained these films were very kindly loaned to them by
friends of The Democratic kepublic of Vietnam (DRV) end the
Provisional Revolutionary Government of The hepublic of
South Vietnam (PRG) and a few films had been brourht alonr
from the States, This will be a lons session, but she felt
the Vietnemese films should be seen first because the other
films can be seen back in the Stetes later if they so desired.
She stated the Vietnamese films ure very, very food and very

PUTTER stated there is one question that should
be resolved end 3
inbassedor OLVID e steted she understood :
this question wes t lenrth et the Flencry Session
in Kew York just prior to their boardinr the pluine, but she
vented to tell them what has transpired since then. She
clined she went to the /merican Embassy and asked them if
the Ambassedor would meet with the entire rroup rather then
Just 12 representatives as previously erreed, She made a.
stronr plez that he meet with the entire deleration. The
matter of meeting with the entire rrovp was originally
considered impossible hy the /mbessador so she proposed
thet he meet with perhaps half the rronp or even €0 people.
This was considered and later she received a telephone call
stating this wes out of the question and that fmbassador *
BRUCE would meet with only 12 people and, therefore, she
proposed that she contact the fmerican Mmbassy in Peris end
express to them again the stronp feelings from the rroup tuet
they want to meet et least with a larrer rroup, perhaps helf
or even a quarter, but specifically more then 12 people, It
clso wes not completely clear whether it would be /mbass«dor
BRUCE or someone else from the Embassy meeting with then.
She also proposed that when she ask for a larrer yroup, she
demand that imbessador BRUCE attend this meeting.

Liter further discussion, it wes resolved thet
PUTTER should contect the :zmerican Embassy to request a larger
froup than 12 be rranted permission to meet with Ambassedor
BRUCE and that fmbassador BRUCE, and not enother member of
his staff, meet with them.

and deputy peneral of the peace comn ttee, and Mr. DOS WAN
WEN (phonetic), who is the secretary of the peéce committee
and secretary of the Committee of Solidarity with The American
People. He is also reported to be a fine conposer.

XUAN THUY spoke in Vietnemese, but his remarks were
relayed through an interpreter. le beran by stating thet in
his language there is e saying that when people seperated
by a long disténce come torether they manifest humor, raity
and warm feelings. There is another seying that Vietnamese
elways treat their friends with werm feelings, particulerly
friends who come from afar. fs fer as the Vietnamese ere con-
cerned, we came from Iianoi a very long distance ewey. You
have come from various States in the United States, elso e
very long distance awey. Therefore, combininr the two sayings
of the Vietnamese lanruege, we show warm feelings to one @nother.
He indicated it was a -great pleasure for him to meet with them
end extend to them his warmest preetings.

XUAN THUY stated that they particularly would like
to know about the situation in Vietnam and the situation of
the Peris conference on Vietném. le could not see how they
could understand these situations but he would like to expound
on the situation from his point of view. He then related facts
concerning Vietnam history and the orecess of United States
intervention in Vietnam. He stated that 160 years ego Vietnam
was an independent and united country, but then from 1946 until
1950 there was war and the French suffered many defeats. Many
difficulties economically and politically arose in France and
the United States had to help the French in their epyression.
They assisted the French in the fields of wer expenditures,
in the fields of war armaments, and in the fields of operational
plans. At that time the sloran for the Vietnamese people was
to fight against the French Sreressors and against the United
ctates interventionists.

Jt another time the Soviet Union was very fer away
from Vietnam and China; the revolutionary forces of China
were still up north, very far in the north, but the Vietnamese,
people were determined to firht arainst the French agrression
and the war went on until 1954. After the battle of Dienbienphu,
the French realized they no lonyer wished to carry on the war.
fhe U. S. Government wanted the French to continue with the wer,
but _the French could not, and the Geneva Conference was signed
in 1954, he 195% Geneva Apreement recognized the independence,
the sovereignty, the unity and the territoriel integrity of
Vietnam. The Vietnamese called these the fundamental principles
of the Geneva frreement. Under these arreements the war must
be ended and peace must be restored, and to echieve these aims
the belligerent forces must be separated and rerrouped into
two parts. ,

It is the opinion of the U, S. Government that the
Indochinese rerion is very rich in raw materials and natural
resources and the United States feels they must exploit these.
Indochina also has 4 very importent strateric significence
in the military field. Because of this the U. 8S. Government
forced the French to recornize the NGO DIKH DIEM edministration.

Concerning the question of prisoners of wer, XUAN
THUY stated the Vietnamese value human beings. We understand
we sympathize with the feelinys of the fmerican people end
with the feelings of the Vietnamese people. We were fighting
apéinst the French end we rave French POWs food treetment, but
only efter the end of the war will this POW question be settled.
Now that the question has arisen, let me ask you who sent them
to their deaths? Who sent them to captivity? We should find
out this canse so we will realize the cause. Once the bombing
is stopped the killing will stop and the wer will end, and
then Vietnam fighters can so home and United States soldiers
will join their families, Lut Mr. NIXON of the United States
administration refuses to do-this. On one hand he insists on
the release of prisoners while on the other hand he continues
to carry on the war. Why does Mr. NIXON keep on demanding
the release of American prisoners and wny does he contimue to

THUY continued that he had asked Mr. BRUCE the seme
question many times and he told him that PRG has set a deadline.
He asked BRUCE if he erreed with it and if he didn't then
propose another deadline and "we shall examine your proposél".
He has even told Mr. BRUCE that he probably arrees with the
deadline of June 30, but possibly his country feels another
propossl is best and the Vietnamese shall help him solve these
difficulties. XUAN THUY steted he does not believe that the

does not have the necessary transportation. If this is the

reason why the PKG demands that THIEU, KY and YHIEM be
removed and e new administretion be formed in South Vietnan,
This new sdministration should stand for peace, independence,
neutrality, end democracy in South Vietnam end this adminis-
tration should talk with PRG to settle the problem. This
demand is not a demand put forwerd only by the National
Liberation Front and the PRG, but the press in South Vietnam
und the various strata of South Vietnamese people, including
the intellectuals, the students, and the working people, are
ell demanding the formation of a new administration in south
Vietnam. Mr. NIXON realizes he cannot apply pressure to us
and compel us to accept United States terms. Then he extended
the war to Cambodia and stared a coup d'etat.

XULM TIUY stated He would like to advise that the

United States and the Saigon puppet troops have found it very
difficult to advance. It has elso been very difficult to
withdraw, but now kr. NIXOW is taking another step by invading
Laos. This will not help South Vietnamese matters, and there
is some talk about an invasion of North Vietnam. The United
States is now massing forces south of the 17th perellel. Mr.
NIXOW has celled United States Marines from Okinews to nearby
South Vietnem and assigned more warships of the 7th Fleet to
the area of the Gulf. For the lest few days the B-52 combat

| plznes and many other types of planes have been carrying on

| intensive bombing arainst Torth Vietnam. If Mr. NIXON fails

i apain in North Vietnam, will he further extend the war?

| On February 25, Mr. NIXOW made a speech to introduce

i his messare on the state of the world adéressed to the United

| States Congressmen. The ist of that messare is the imple-
mentation of the NIXON doctrine and Vietnamization of the wer
in Indochina. Instead of ending the war, this will prolong it.
This means the Americen people will be tied down to the war
machinery. On the previous evening at 3 a.m, Paris time,
Merch 9, NIZON held w press conference during which he stated

| that since he came to power American casualities have been reduced.

United Stetes forces have been reduced by one-half already.

lle reported the United States operation in Camhodia was
correct and just. The inva sion by South Vietnamese forces .
with United States support in Laos is correct and just.

The widening of the war is only hampering the with-
drewal of United States forces. The wer was previously limited
to South Vietnam, but now the war is extended to Cambodia and
Leos. Perheps, he is even thinking of invadinr North Vietnam
and this too will be a widening of the wer. XUAN THUY steted
that just recently NGUYEN VAN THIEU issued a statement con-
cerning the possibility of invading North Vietnam. He claimed
that since North Vietnam has its forces in South Vietnam, then
South Vietnam may also attack the North. The United States
has coritinued its reconnaissance flights but if the recon-
naissance flights are shot at, then the United States claims
it will have reason to attack immediately. If the North
Vietnamese infiltrate forces in South Vietnam at a level
endangering the security of United States forces, then the
United States will react.

President NIXON has stated thet he will withdraw
#11 /merican forces on two conditions; one, that 611 North
Vietnamese forces be withdrawn and, two, that ell Americen
prisoners be released. If these two conditions are not met
Jmerican forces will remain in Couth Vietnam. Mr. NIXON was
esked to plece a deadline on the troop withdrawal but he seid
none could be Fevealed, If NIXON alleges his policy of Viet-
nemizetion is successful and his doctrine, the NIXON doctrine,
is a success, why does he not withdraw a1] /mericen forces?
Since he does not withdraw the American forces, he ‘aust
realize his Vietnamization policy is a failure. NIXON himself
does not want withdrawal of all ‘merican forces. Nr. NIXON
does not went serious nerotiation of « peaceful settlement in
Vietnam. Instead, le is seeking a military victory.

The Vietnamese consider humen beings as friends and they

people es our friemis., When they were fightinr the French
erpressors, they were firhtinr are@inst the colonialism of

the French Covernment. herardless, they considered the
French people their friends. The Vietnemese deleration is
willing to discuss the matter of withdrawal in such a way

that it will not be é victory for either side, It is provided
that Vietnam can become independent when there are no foreifn
troops on their soil. Let the Vietnamese people settle
Vietnamese affeirs «fter the restoration of peace, end Vietnam
will not be reunified overnight: North Vietnam will ro on its
socialist path while South Vietneim will follow neutra lism.

Concerning the reunification of the country it will
take time. Let the people in the Horth and South understand
each other and let them decide whether they went to reunify.
Reunification will then be cerried out as desired. There is
no hétred amonr the Vietnamese toward the Jiericans. They
will esk the United Stetes to help them in the technolorical
field and in the scientific field in the reconstruction of
their country because everyone knows that technolorically and
scientificelly Vietnamese are more backwerd than the Unitei
States. They are prepered to esk aid and essistance from
other countries, Worth Vietnam will esk assistance not only
from the socialist countries, but also from the capitalist
countries. They should have trade relations with frence.
ifter the restoration of peace, you can help the Vietnamese
in the reconstruction and will have trade reletions with them.
The United States is a beautiful country and both North and
South Vietnam is a beautiful country, and perhaps your peoole

Conditions should be such that Americans and Vietnamese

to sow death, destruction, and hatred on Vietnemese soil.

The imerican GIs in South Vietnam do not consider Vietnamese
as humans. They are free to kill and disable anybody, whether
they be ared people or women or children. fhe tMnited Stetes

broken up, fathers have been killed, mothers have been jailed,

wepinr a very herd strurrle, they understand that e11 actions
by the U. S. Government -in Vietnam originate from the selfish
interests of United States war profiteers and rulers. The
merican people in every walk of life want peace, respect,

and freedom just like every other people. The émerican people ~
have to rive their money and their lives to this dirty war
which tarnishes the honor of the United States, We believe
that «ny American of rood will is awere of the real situation
in Vietnam end cannot oppose the distorted wer of arrression

of his rovernnent. This is evidenced by the fact many /mericans
heve cour.reously voiced their opposition to that wer. They
demand that the NIXON administration stop it, bring all the

tration is evidently pursuinr the war and extension to the

Indochinese people. She thinks that more thén ever the Viet-

member of the deleration of the iG, who, spezxinr in

Vietn se, strted that Nadime BIN had spoken ebont the

sent nts of the Gouth Vietnamese people to the American
people. fo start with he wonld like to cite a statement
made by a Saipon student which appeared in ¢ newspaper
published in Saigon on June 17, 1970. Time and afain the
South Vietnamese people have told the United States they

are wrony and would like to ask the United States if they
are only strurrling arainst the fmericen war mongers, against
exploitation. The Vietnemese demand the right to live.

In order to speak to you with sentiments of the
Vietnamese pecple, students, brothers, sisters, and mothers,
our feelings are the same. Mr. NIXON declared when he
succeeded JOHNSON th.t the war would end within six months
and within six months peace would be restored in Vietnam. :
WIXON has not ended the war in Vietnem but has extended the war
into Cambodia and Laos. It would have been better for this
neeting today to have taken place in Sairon or in another
plece, jn New York. It would nave been better today to discuss
the problems of culture, economy, social eff.irs, and litereture.

In 1969 Mr. NIXON said it wes time to nave a new,
inmediate end to the war. Everybody realizes that Kr. Nis
statement to end the war is the NIXON doctrine end Vietnamization.
We went the fmerican war in Vietnem to be cut down to be sure

that the Vietnamese people have the ripht to self-determination.
iccording, to NDION's Vietnemization, it has two main components:
one, to enhance’ the Saicon puppet troops and, two, to reelize
the lonr-scale pacification cempairn, By bolstering the

Seigon puppet the udministration's armed forces had berun
massive raids, The Mited States and Sairon armies increased
the number of their troops. The schoolboys 15 end 16 years old
were drifted as well &s men over 50. The United States is

NIXON can never achieve is to improve the firitinr spirit,
on puppet troops. Peceuse
of the escalation in Laos ind Cambodia, the soldiers in the
Sairon army realize they are dying @ vseless death and they
ere not dyinr for the fatherland. General DD CLO ThI has
remarked chout the low morele of the puppet troops. Ie
declered the liberzted armed forces have heen defected en
driven into the junfle. Unfortunately, Generzl ThI wes shot
down and was killed, Meanwhile, the morale of the Mmited
States troops is ¢lso very low.

Local edministrations have suppressed free elections
thet existed previously. The hecds of districts and the
heeds of provinces «re now controlling their elections by,
physical means. They are under control of the imperialists.

The strurrle of the Leotizn people has e long history.

In early 190G they were firhtinr erainst the French. The
Laotien invasion is now in its fourth week and presently
violence exists throurhout the whole country. It is renerelly
on operation cerried out by Americ#en and Sairon troops. The
operation on koute 9 is the most importent path. On February
th forces of the Saifon rerime supported by ‘Americe invaded
lower Leos. ‘They traveled on Route 9.which is the only road
which joins the western part of Vietnam and is the néerrowist
point of Indochina. One of the objectives for this path on
Route 9 was to occupy the small town of Khe Sanh. This would
rive them an opportunity then to march north and into North
Vietnam. This operation is called "Operation 719". Once
this zone has been occupied, the /mericens can then extend
the operation to the whole of Indochina. This is to sey first
of ell, they went to control Route 9. This would hecone a
strateric road enablinr them to join their bases in Thailand
in the west ond the China Sea where the Seventh Fleet is
stationed. Laos would then be cut in half. The second
objective would be to start operations of search and destroy

towerd the south of the country towerd the Bolovens Plateau
where American and satellite troops on the frontier would
join other troops. The third objective would be the meren
towards the north which is considered the center of Laotian
resistance. These objectives are the most ambitious and the
most dengerous.

Vhnat JOUNSON was not able to do, NIXON is trying.
What MC NAMAI wanted to do is cut Laos in half by en elec-
trified drive, NIXON is trying to cut Laos in half with fire
and blood. This is the policy of the /merican Government in
Laos. This is a policy that NIXON has followed which some
people refer to as Vietnamization,.

In order to better understand the events in laos
one mist know the activities of the American imperielists
over the past year. ifter reviewing these fects, you will
understand this Asian policy of NIXON's end why he leunched
the invasion. The aim of the im ericons has now changed since
the second world war to the occupation of the Leotien terri-
tory where they hope to make an American military base.
Vietnam is con isidered 2 balcony on the Pacific and Laos is
the sword into the heart of Asia, This is what the American
straterists sey. With relation to ovr country, this policy
has elready been put into applicetion for many years. The
fmericens first used military and economic aid, then they
used the South Vietnem advisors to control the Vientiane
administration. Some of the orranizations involved were the
Propressive Evaluation Office, the military assistence
advisors proup, and the U. S. Informztion Service, the U. S.
frmy and the Merines The American Embassy, which is an
ebsolute pro- military eae end SEATO should also be

Then they tried to use military personnel, end then they
beran to essassinate neutral ministers. In 1964 they
overthrew the nationel union fovernment and replaced it with
a puppet cdministration. They procticed the policy of peece
end neutrality but in reality this edministration wes illeral.
They used puppet troops to mount attacks and encrozchment on

his policy of Vietnanization. Ile dropped in re-enforcements
consisting of many units of ertillery and infantry from
Thailand. 4merican planes hombed the liberated zones daily.
We heave counted more than 3,000 tons of bombs every day on

the Laotian territory. -No villare in the liberated zone

was spared. Politically the /merican imperiglists have tried
to slander, to shame the friendship and solidarity between
Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. They have also tried to smother
the strurple for a noliticel settlenent of the Laos concepts

The panel was then asked severasl questions by the
members of the press. One of these questions concerned what
conclusions they have errived at in their investiration.

_St£N DALE volunteered an enswer and stated that to be very
honest they have not arrived at any conclusions because of
their desire to remein open-minded until they have met with
#1l people concerned. He then expressed his anrer over only
having 12 delerates meet with Ambassador BKUCE when é11 the
other representatives at the Paris Peace Talks spoke to the
entire rroup. During the tirade, DALE also commented that
they have met Vietnamese who hold no enimosity towerd the
imerican people. He indicated that he had been a correspondent
for the «rmed Forces in Korea, and he hes noticed the absence
of a communist line taxing place at the Paris Peace Conference.

When asked why the rroup decided to have « press
conference in Paris on this day rather than writ until they
returned to the States, it was stated that the purpose was
to icqueint the press and others with-wnat they had done up

Vietnam has exerted efforts to muke certain United States

Ilanoi withdraws its troops of aggression from South Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia.

‘
The communists claim they desire a political settle-
ment, which settlement berins with the overthrow of the duly
elected rovernnent of South Vietnam and to make this govern-~
ment totally communistic. South Vietnam has eccepted foreign
forces to help allow them to live in peace. / settlement
under the terms of the communists in North Vietnam would not
settle this problem and they would have to live under the
force of the communists. South Vietnam desires a peaceful
co-existence with North Vietnam, The position of the South
Vietnanese Governaent has two main clauses, the withdrewel
of externel forces which are illerally stationed in South
Vietnen, Leos and Cembodia, and 2 politiez1 solution to solve
South Vietnam problems. However , these ere not possible
because of the refusal of North Vietnam to discuss them, It
is a well known fact that the No Chi Minh frail is i threat
to the war and links the supply of wer materizls with the

In our view, peace is nearer than people think.

NGUYEN XUAN PIIONC, Deputy of the Chief Deleration
of South Vietnam, stated that the Vietnem conflict is very
complex, and they, as a rroup, heve heard more about it frou
the opposing forces. Unlike North Vietnam, the South does
not hive communist parties in every country of the world.
They have mede chanres in the past 15 years in rovernnent

jle at war. They don't have proparanda macl.ines throurhont
the world.

Tne communist forees want to take over Vietnem «
@ll of Indochina by force if necessary. This is « set
of North Vietnem to impose communist rule on all Vietnemese |
people. War hes lasted too lonr. M i m will continue
to war until it rets its wishes of ¢ total communist rule.
South Vietnam has used every means toward a peaceful solution,
Jfter two years of talks in Paris, they have produced practically
hothing.

The communists went @ complete withdrawal of forces
znd they want to replice the elected sovernnent*in South
Vietném with a Provisional Coalitionel Government.

During the question and answer session, PHONG denied
South Vietnam has had a world-wide properznde campairn. He
clained North Vietnam totally refused to nerotiate and they
will not talk to others who have not expressed an arreement

ere separate countries in accordance with the Geneve fecord

fnother question posed to him concerned the use

stated that recently a deleration was sent to one prison
end no tiser cares were found. Concerning the prisoner of

North Vietnam will not furnish the names of e11 those

done.

On Monday, Merch 8, 1971, rererdless of previous

#11 other countries in Indochina supported them. North
Vietnam rejected them literally the dey they were made.

Their representatives in Paris have refused to discuss

them in any form. What is more they refuse all efforts of

During the question and enswer session, it was
expleined that the United 5 es position on prisoners is
different because they consider it a separate issue. It is in
issne in which both sides are roverned. by the Geneva Convention
of 1949, in which both sides are oblirated with respect to

The United States hes offered the releese of ell prisoners

both sides, There was some discussion between Embassy
officials and members-of the group over the question of
releesing prisoners of wer prior to the cessation of
hostilities. fn Embassy official stated there has been 2
great deal of evidence indicating that the treatment of
prisoners by the DRV has not been humane. The ddegation
expressed its approval of this statement and somebody men-
tioned "tiger cages", The Mmbessy official remarked he did
not sey prisons, he said prisoners. One way to solve the
prisoner question would be to release them, all of them, on
both sides repardless of whether or not a precedent would be
set.

In answer to one of the questions an Embassy of ficial

ation of bombing and shooting on both sides. ‘This cease-

Enbassy officials indicated that this was not possible. The
Embassy official remarked thet they have been told many times
by many individuals during the various stares of nerotiations
that if they would stop the bombing, the other side would
neyottate., If they would let the fr 2 pert in the talks
then the would be serious na tiations. They were told
that if they took out snbstan 1 forces there would be
serious nerotiations. They have stopped the hombing in the

. : _ One hundred and seventy Americans from 1 states will leave from New York's

Kennedy Aixport on March 3 for a week-long conference with principals in the
Paris talks and others. Their objective is finding out what the. requisites for
peace in Southeast Asia really are. “
The Citizens Conference on_Ending the War in Indochina, es the project is
called, is sponsored by the aeerten Priende Service Committee (asc), Clergy
j and Laymen Concerned (CALC) and the Fellowship.of Reconciliation (FoR).
i "The conference will afford a large number of American citizens access to

and thoughtful discussion with many persons long familiar with the “Indochina

struggle," explained Stewart Meacham, peace education secretary of the APSC.

| Ve hope that upon.their retwm to the Wnited States, the ‘participants will be
new and creative interpreters, in their respective commmnities, of what they
understand the requisites of peace to really be." i

Participants expect to meet with representatives of the Provisional Revolu-

* tionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG, formerly the National
Liberation Front), “the Democratic Republic of Vietnera (North Vietnam), the
Republic of Vietnam (Saigon) and the ws. Delegation.

Meetings are also veing arcanged with representatives of the National
United Front of Cambodia, the Laotian Student tnion and various “independent
South Vietnamege groups opposed to the war (including Recaceeriemaae Catholics,
students and groups supporting dissident members gf the Saigon Adwinistration's

a anxious to leamm @ great dewl mere about the recent upsurge of civilian resist-

i The Rev. Richard Fernandes, director of CALC, indicated that “the conference
will come ab an extwomely propitious woment given the United States second in-
vasion of a sovereign country (Laos) in less than eleven months. Mr. Melvin
Laird," the clergyman continued, “has told us that the invasion of Laos doesn’t
represent a widening of the war--we ave interested to see what both Asians and
Buropeans see in this new move.” ‘ :

Discussion tnen centered arcund actually proposed
actions for the couing fall offensive. Bob Levering stated
he did not know what the PCPJ is doitg yet, but that he had
to go to New York for a meeting soon and would know more
thereafter. A tentative idea related by Levering was that

. of the "Yearly Death Toll" idea. Levering advised this idea
involves obtaining persons from throzghout the nation to
represent the war dead and having the ravel te Washington,

people would gather across the strec* from the Capitol or

Three general proposals were seemingly agreed on:

Dear Mr. Tolson:

Attached is an invitation to a seminar that I hope you will find of special
interest. This event is next in a program of off-the-record unpublicized
discussions for government officials sponsored by the American Friends
Service Committee for the past twenty years.

the wide range of topics, covering both foreign and domestic affairs, has
drawn the participation of many Members of Congress and senior officials in
the Executive Branch. For your information I enclose a list of attenders
at a recent dinner seminar on poverty in the U.S,

Your personal participation in the discussion of the crisis in criminal
justice and related fields would be most welcome. I hope your schedule will
permit your acceptance. I£, however, you cannot join us, I would appreciate
the suggestion for a substitute from among your colleagues.

fe
we look forward to a call from your office as soon as possible. f

Re BA telephone calls to WFO Supervisor, JOHN
PALMER, 5/2-3/72.

At approximately nine a.m. on 5/3/72, SA's
. JOSEPH LYTON MINNES and PAUL THOMAS BAKER conducted a
physical surveillance in the area of the Friends School,
5117 N,. Charles Street, Baltimore. It was previously
determined that the Baltimore Chapter of the American
Friends Service Committee (AFSC) would send tke demonstrators
to Washington, D.C. on 5/3/72 to participate in a one day
vigil at the White House, and transportation would be by
chartered bus through the Parker Service Bus Company, Baltimore,

At 9:10 a.m. on 5/3/72, it was observed that 70
individuals, most of whom were. in their early 20's, boarded
two buses from the above company, and the buses departed

Statement from Bronson P. Clark, Executive Secretary

Two representatives of the American Friends Service Committee have just
returned from Hanoi where they delivered a humanitarian shipment of heart
surgery equipment. They are Dr. George Perera, former associate dean
of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a re-
cognized expert on hypertension, and John A. Sullivan, Associate Executive
Secretary of AFSC.

Our representatives broug&t home personal and photographie evidence of what
some of the American bombs are now doing: wrecked hospitals, schools, homes
and cultural buildings. They stood on and photographed a primary and a second-
ary dike at Nam Dinh which had been bombed with no visible military target
nearby. Whether the bombing of civilian institutions, the maiming and killing
of civilians and the damage and weakening of dikes is intentional or accidental is
academic. The critical question is whether these things are uappening, and the
direct, first-hand evidence of AFSC observers is that they are.

U.S. bombardment and naval shelling of North Vietnam must be terminated. For
a technologically superior country like ours to be rainingsophisticated destruction
on a relatively defenseless, essentially peasant people who are completely with-
out the means of the slightest attack on our country brings dishonor to American
ideals. Our representatives found in all their conversations and observations that
the North Vietnamese people, far from being driven to defeat, are uniting more
strongly under the pressure and putting their ability to adapt and survive to work
to outlast and endure the bombing.

In the name of all that is holy, in the name of spiritual values, in the very name
of America, this loathsome bombing and shelling must stop.

Hostile planes knife through cold and silent sky.

Hearse loudspeakers signal the approach. :

The sirens that I heard in London —

Another land, another time, another pang of history ~

T hear again.

Theirs is the raucous call known well to ears that have heard war before.

! Who goes there overhead? Is he

From the plains of Kansas, green slopes of Vermont,
| The soft-voiced south, the uproar of New York,

. The ever-greening Northwest U.S.A. ?

Who up there knows what I see here?

Look: There goes the enemy:

| A sweet-eyed child chubby-legged on a bike.

A mother caring anxiously for her young.

A slender girl bent over green shoots in a paddy,

A rider off his bicycle and sitting by a hole —

The single-occupancy shelter designed to beat the bomb.

Men, women, children. ..the enemy is everywhere?
And the targets abound.

The factories, ports, rails, homes, hospitals, dikes
That hold the salted sea from land,

Or coursing rivers that bring green life.

Or death.

Who sits underground?

I sit in concrete shelter rooms

and talk of war.

With a Vietnamese surgeon whom war has forced

To new techniques of saving lives.

An Indian of supreme dignity who

Presides over the international group

named to control the agreement of men who

Decided 18 years ago to supervise a peace that hasn't come.
An actress who knows the studios of

Paris, London, Hollywood,

Now to find, falling asleep at night,

That her pillow is wet from tears

Brought forth by sights of war and thoughts of men

H Her country has sent to ride the skies on tubes of death,

Oh, Vietnam, Vietnam.

I know your gentle, slow and graceful people in the south,
And now I see here, in Hanoi, the same soft sweetness,
‘The same deep love of life and land.

The same people, the same clothes, the same words,

As those I know beyond the Ben Hai.

Uh, Vietnam.
In the enveloping heat of July, another flush comes to my face.
How can it be? When will it stop? Who will say the word?

Re San Antonio letter to Washington Field dated

Enclosed for the Bureau is one copy of referenced
San Antonio letter to Washington Field.

For the information of the Bureau and receiving
Noffices, referenced Philadelphia letter to San Antonio
dated 4/23/73, requested specific Bureau authority prior to
covering the lead as stated in San Antonio letter to
Washington Field dated 4/2/73. This request for specific
authorization from the Bureau was made inasmuch as the
American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is a function
of the religious Society of Friends and is not under
investigation at Philadelphia, which covers the AFSC Headquarters,
and is not believed to be an appropriate subject for FBI
investigation.

SA 100-3119 : : sateen

For the information of the Bureau and receiving
‘ offices, San Antonio, being aware of the religious nature
of the AFSC, does not conduct active investigation of the

+ organization.

However, the San Antonio Office of AFSC is
frequented by present and past subjects of known subversive
character; i.e., THOMAS FLOWER, San Antonio file 100-10305,
who is presently in Leavenworth Penitentiary for his anti-war
activities; THOMAS WETZLER, San Antonio file 100-12944, past
leader and organizer of the San Antonio Vietnam Veterans
Against the War (VVAW); and RITA NEUREUTHER, San Antonio
file 100-13682, who appears at the majority of San Antonio
demonstrations. All of these persons mentioned as well as
others have had access to the telephone located at the AFSC
Office in the past or have access to it now.

Tolls were obtained regarding the San Antonio
AFSC Office telephone for the purpose of complying with the
spirit of the Computerized Telephone Number File Program
and its potential in identification of the New Left
communication, network nationwide. The further purpose
was to determine if the telephone was actually being used
by persons in which the Bureau had an interest, or was
merely available to them. The lead as set forth in referenced
San Antonio letter would accomplish this end.

By utilizing good judgement in covering the lead
as set forth in referenced San Antonio letter it is felt
this objective can be accomplished without embarrassment
to the Bureau. As will be noted the lead required only an
indices check and the forwarding of pertinent information
to San Antonio.

Bureau authority is requested for each of the

receiving offices to accomplish the lead as set forth in
referenced San Antonio letter.

PURPOSE:

‘

To advise Director relative to letter of Ms. Nike

members of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) and
obtain approval for attached acknowledgement.

BACKGROUND :

Navor mentions watching a special telecast on
"surveillance" which program shows Philadelphiaas representing
a typical American city, The AFSC is located in Philadelphia.
Navor alleges that AFSC had been under surveillance and expressed
shock that such surveillance was so prevalent and felt that this
is injurious to the freedom of Americans. She urged the Director
to give the matter serious consideration, of

As a result of the break in of the eee
Resident Agency 3/8-9/71, an investigation was launched to _
determine the perpetrators of the burglary and who was
distributing the stolen documents to the press, Many
individuals, some of whom were members af the AFSC, were
contacted for interview during the course of this investigation.
ST-log REC 88 7. ; a
AFSC, a quaker-Pactrist organization, has been active
in draft resistance, the antiwar movement, and has made substantial
financial contributions to major antiwar groups and demonstrations.
They have held many antiwar demonstrations in Washington and
throughout the U.S. No active investigation has been conducted
by the FBI on the AFSC, The activities regarding demonstrations
have been followed and pertinent data disseminated to other
government agencies in the intelligence community, —

Memorandum to Mr. E. S, Miller
Re: Amefican Friends Service Committee
100-11392

The recent TV Program to which Navor refers is an
apparent rerun of a 60-minute program produced by CBS Reports
captioned "Under Surveillance," originally broadcast on 12/23/71,
This program focuses on the City of Philadelphia and studies
the various forms of surveillance by law enforcement, government
and private agencies, such as wire taps, stake outs, photographing
and tape recording suspect persons, monitoring the mails and
investigations by credit companies, The FBI cases mentioned in
this program were a rehash of cases brought to public light as
a result of the surfacing of stolen FBI documents from the
Media Resident Agency burglary.

The AFSC are plaintiffs in a civil action filed in
July, 1971, in the United States District Court, Philadelphia,
in Which the Attorney General, the former Director and others
are named as defendants, In addition to the AFSC, the Philadelphia
Resistance and eighteen individuals are plaintiffs, The complaint
alleges that the defendants through harassment, intimidation and
surveillance have unlawfully intruded on plaintiffs' right to
privacy and free speech, The matter is pending and the pretrial
proceedings have not yet been completed, There were no illegal
surveillances of any kind concerning AFSC.

Bufiles contain no information regarding Nike Navor.
RECOMMENDATION:

That attached acknowledgement letter be sent to
Nike Navor,.

I read the comments in your lettpr dated

Justice Department

Washington, D. C.

22nd Ju 1973

Mr, Mabnieldt —_
Mr. Hem.

Dear Mr, Kelly:

Mr. Eardley
Mrs.

Congradulations on your appointment. With the help of God and your vast excellen
experience, may you accomplish the pursuit of freedom and justice in this often
Blessed and often torn country. Yours is one of the most difficult jobs in this
country. My silent and spoken prayers are with you.

At this point as a concerned citizen, I would like to mention something which is
troubleing me. several nights ago I watched a special telacast on "survailance."
I'm sure that you are aware of the program and may even have watched yourself. }

As you may know, the telacast chose Philadelphia as its model; representing a

typical American city. The American Friends Service Con Committee is located in

Philadelphia. As a young Quaker-attender, with mai many ny of the pr predetermined suspicions

about govenmental activity that so many young people have, I wasnot surprised that the

AFSC had been under survailance. I am also not surprised, due to the many radical concer;
++, jof Friends toady, to learn that many Friends are now personally under survailence.

I would like to point out however that Friends as a group are not interested inthe

joverthrow of any government. In my three years of association with Friends, I have

never heard this type of feeling voiced. Perhaps I should point out as a point of

information as well as a personal concern that it has been often felt "that the

business of being a Quaker is to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable."

However as a non-violent religious group, we use our intelects and our souls ia in

this endevor. a 1 imac
RG 7 Mts fL fm 78
What did surprise and shock me wis that a type of ‘general survailance” wal to be

{so prevalent. That people who had committed no particular crime and alle were not
considered about to commit such, were under a type of broad sweeping survailance. I
\feel this is injurious to our freedom as Americans. And I urge you to give the matter
lyour serious consideration. Seer eee eee

‘Our system of government provides that one is innocent until proven 4ilAVG 161973
“<constitution provides for personal freedmon of speech, press, and freedom of assembly.
Our nation was founded on the ideals of moral and political desent. “PEYTaPPWeseit as our
-insurance policy for safeguarding freedom. We are indeed lucky to have such a system

of government. Many people of the earth have no such freedoms as their right.

Realizing fully that there is often a fine line between safeguarding the freedoms of
the public and providing "security" as well, I imagine that law enforcement agencies
must often feel that they are walking a tight-rope of sorts.

On the belief that the American public too often demands of their elected and appointea
officals much more than they would ever demand of themselves, I am in this letter
committing myself to the above written moral and social beliefs. I realize fully

that this letter may have the opposite affect of which it was intended. That if there
is not already a file on me ( I doubt that there is), this letter may start one.
However, in good faith I submit this letter to your consideration.

‘ On January 28, 1975, NY T-1 made available
the following information concerning recent international
operations of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC).

The AFSC is shipping $50,000 worth of school
books to North Vietnam as an initial step in a program of aid
to the Communists. A delegation of AFSC teachers will soon
go to Hanoi following an invitation from Hanoi after
discussions there with three AFSC staff members in August, 1974.
One of these staff members was Louis\Schneider, Executive
Secretary of AFSC. The, Canadé4n office of AFSC sent an initial
gift of $2,500 to Hanoi and one member of the AFSC teacher's group
travelling to North Vietnam will be from Canada.

: Corinne‘Mohnson, AFSC Latin America Director,
returned from a 23 day trip to_Chile and other Latin American
countries in November, 1974. AFSC in Chile works with the
Committee of Co-operation for Peace in Chile, a church group.

i a ieee

no record in Bufiles concerning the Nature Conservancy. The x
American Friends Service Committee is well-known to the Bureau ag\.,
a pacifist group within the Quaker Church. The Bureau has ae
not investigated this group, although the Intelligence
Division followed the activities of this organization in
connection with demonstrations protesting United States
action in Vietnam. The John Birch Society is also well-

known to the Bureau and has not been investigated by the FBI. x<N

May 21, 1975

Federal Bureau of Investigation
Public Affairs Office
Washington, DC

Sirs:

Over the past several weeks three widely different organizations
have become involved in controversy in this isolated little community.
They are the Nature Conservancy, American Friends Service > Committee,
and the John Birch Society. All three are undeéx Shy emotional
attack from various elements in the community... People are taking
sides and firm opinions are being established. Yet facts are scarce

In a small, rural setting, such an issue pits friend against {/
friend, neighbor against neighbor, and tears at the very fabric of
the” community.

What guidance can you offer, and what information can you provide
to help us to an understanding of the true nature and purpose of these
organizations?

Sincerely,

onald C. Whitmill
