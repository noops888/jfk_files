however; AISC personnel were present during the beginning •

of these preparation meetings.

However, it was not indicated

that these AFSC personnel would be going to Hanoi for the

January March sessions.

The January-March sessions will be

sponsored, or at least

co-sponsored,, by the AFSC.

The above group left Washington, D.C. on November

24, 1971, for the Thanksgiving holidays,

but planned to return

their preparation sessions on November 29, 1971, to be held

in the above building at 14th and U Streets.

The preparation

sessions are to continue for the next three weeks, with

reparture for Hanoi planned for December 29, 1971.

and

to exchange political views etween antimar Americans and

North Vietnamese citizens,

and is learn the location of North

Vietnamese embassies and

personnel throughout te world so

that support for the legitimacy of the North Vietnamese and the

North Vietnamese position in

the var could be rendered.

The

source observed that the tour, which was to extund over eight

days, was obviously a propaganda tool for the North Vietnamese

Government.

A bulletin of a Philadelphia Quaker action group dated

9/2/71, reported that MOYER recently had led a Conference on

the New Society in Maine. Duru the People's Coalition for Peace

and Justice national conference in Milwaukee, W sconsin, 6/25 - 27/71.

MOYER presented a paper entitled, "From Radical - Liberal to

Social-Transtormationist, New Demands for the Movement," and signed

by "BILL MOYER, 6/23/71,

the Marco Non-Violent Community, 545 East

Sedgwick Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."

The source gained

the impression

that the HONS has

a director in Philadelphia, and

that there are directors

in other US cities. Among others,

MOYER,

and urs. MARTIN LUTHIR KING, JP., are on the Board of Directors.

The group, which was to leave on a tour of Nortn Vietnam,

was comprised of four AFSC staft members and 1l student leaders

from both the east and west coasts.

The group net for planning

sessions during the weekends of 11/13 - 14/71, and 11/20 - 21/71.

The planning sessions were led entirely by MoYEr.

Approximately

25 - 30 people attend the planning session on 11/13 - 14/71, Of

which only 15 were to travel to North vietnam.

The rest of

the

group appeared to be members of the NONS but merely observed the

planning session and did not participate.

The source gained the impression that all individuals

invited on the tour, upon their return, will work as paid staff

members for ArSC or NONS.

The following

individuals comprised

the tour group:

During the planning sessions MYER remarked that all

tour participants were required to obtai. receipts for any

expenditures made on the trip because AFSC was not paying for

the entire trip, and justification of expenditures was necessary.

MOYER did not, however, indicaie who the financial backer for the

trip was.

The group was to spend approximately three days visiting

with the North Vietnamese Paris Peace delegation and then to fly

to Hanoi for four - five days in North Vietnam.

MOYER informed the tour participants that they were chosen

because of their past involvement in the peace and antiwar movements.

The source observed that none of the tour participants appeared

èspecially radical or militant, but were, for the most part,

"enthusiastic, energetic youths from upper middleclass families."

The group was to take no supplies or medicines to US

prisoners of war and in response to a tour participant's suggestion

that the names of prisoners of war be taken

so that correspondence

with their families could be initiated upon the group's return,

hoXeR responded

that such was not the purpose of the trip and was

not suggested. Moyke urged that the tour participants not deviate

from the above limited purpose of the tour.

The source noted that in association with MOYER the trip

waS

also being arranged by TONY HENRY, the head of the Tenants

Union, New York City.

MOYER's address in Philadelphia is 4719 Cedar Street,

telephone 215-724-7398.

The source stated thit he was instructed by stonby cook

to 100k up one (FNU) KWAI (phonetic), while he was in Hanoi.

"KWAI

is supposedly a student leader on North titam, and possibly

met

with COOK during a

peacr conference in Crochusarakia in 1967,

when CoOk presumably was there titlowing

During the week of 1115 - 19/71, STONEY COOK informed

the source, while both were in Chicago, that between January -

March, 1972, a series of workshops and conferences were to be

held in Hanoi. COOK informed that 20 - 25 people from the US

were to take part in these sessions, and he encouraged. the

source to participate also since it would equip him to further

advance in the civil rights and peace movements. He was encouraged

by cook to attenot to remain in Hanoi when the above tour returned

to the us so that he gould be there when the workshop group arrived

in january. COOK stated that it would be too expensive for ArSC to

pay the source's transportation on both the Thanksgiving tour and

on the later January tour, and airplane fare could be saved if the

source were able to stay in Hanoi.

AFSC personnel were also

knowledgeable regarding this tour since one DEBBIE (INU), AFSC

Chicago Staff Worker, also mentioned it to the source and encouraged

him to attempt to remain in Hanod rather than return in order to

save costs.

STONEY COOK said that "some ministers" would be attending

the january sessiors, and a high official of the Urban Coalition

has resigned or wa; going to resign to nake the trip.

The January

group

was to be composed of both blacks and white, and they would

be paid, to some extent, by AFSC.

STONEY COOK was to be the

coordinator of the group, and for this period of time would l on

a leave of absence from the Southern Christian Leadership Conterence

the scLe Cook is quite active in organizing

student groups in the peace movement. COOk has been in touch with

Us peace movement individuals and North Vietnamese "counter parts"

since 1967 when be attended a peace conference in Czechoslovakia

attended by approximately 40 US citizens and a North Vietnamese

delegation.

It is believed, though not contirmed, that COOk then

traveled with five other Americans including TOM HAYDEN and RENNIE

DAVIS to North Vietnam.

The source informed that STONEY COOK, along with three

other individuals in SCLC, are active in foreign liaison on behalf

of SCIe with governments und organizations promoting what they view

to be similar objeciives.

The other three SCLC individuals are

ALBERT SAMPSON, JAMLS ORANGE, and JAMES BEVELS).

On 11/19/71, the source traveled to Philadelphia to

attend what he

thought was a final pre-departure planning session

for the Thanksgiving tour.

On the evening of 11/19 TONY HENRY

of the Tenants Union informed him that it would be impossible for

the source to attend both the Thanksgiving tour and the January

harch sessions, and he encouraged the source to choose to attend

the January - March sessions since that trip would be longer in

duration and would be of more value to him in the civil rights anc

peace movemente.

He was informed that the majority of the people

that would participate in the January - March trip would be SCLe

personnel, people whom the source knew, and he was told this trig

would be more enjoyable also for that reason, since the source did

not know anyone on the Thanksgiving tour.

The source was unable

to make both trips because of the costs involved and the trans

portation expense.

While in Philadelphia the group was informed that there

would be one further pre-departure planning session to be held in

Canada, The Thanksg ving tour group left Philadelphia on the

morning of 11/21/71, en route to New York's Kennedy Airporte here

They changed planes tor a esty in canada,

source.

The flight to Canada was approximately one hour in curation

and upon arrival they were met by a bus which transported the entire

group, including TONY HUNRY and the source who was botto go

to a farm/estate

appoared to be a retreat of some type since It was located in

rural area about 50 - 60 miles from the airport, on which was

located a lodge, housing accommodations, aud a separate dining hall

The group was informed that they were possibly to learn

the identities of several priconers of war to be released by North

Vietnam early next year.

A group of predominantly SCLC personnel

are to leave for Hanoi 12/29/71,

to conduct educational and training

classes for these released prisuners of war, the classes to extend

from January - March, 1972.

If the Thanksgiving tour group 18

successiul in obtaining in advance the names of these prisoneis of

war, STONEY COOK

will conduct background investigation on them in

order to prepare for the educational sessions beginning in January.

The educational sessions will be financed, at least in part,

It Is hoped that between live and 20 prisoners

wIll be released, and SCLC personnel and TONY HENRY hope that

the majority, in not all, will be black. WILLIAl MOYER did not

accompany the Thanksgiving tour as originally planned; the tour

was under the leadership of ANDRE SINU), AFSC Staff Worker from

Philadelphia, and three or four other AFSC Staff

Workers.

In addition to the above listed names, the Thanksgiving

tour group was requested to question prisoners of war, if they

were able to interview then, as to what the prisoners of war

expected of government assistance and government programs when

they returned to the us.

* NEW SOCIETY

FACKET

The Movement for a New Society grows

from the recognition that the war in

Indochina has been but a single manifestation

of a disease pervasive throughout global

society. To bring about real and lasting

change, concerned people must confroat this

disease wherever it exisis, suggesting by

the very means we use and the alternatives Fro

create the beginnings of a new society.

CONTENTS:

The MNS is a network of autonomous

groups committed to radical nonviolent social

change. Together we are developing an

analysis of the present system, a vision of a

beiter wor!d, and a sustained nonvioler: t

struggle. Training is an important part of

our movement. The values of the new society

can become a part of our lives now as we

build community and alternative institutions.

THE MOVEMENT FOR A NEW SOCIETY IS

a network of collectives working to bring about fundamental

nonviolent change. These small groups often arise from already

existing friendships or ties of workplace or religion.

The groups use a variety of names depending on the basis of

their affinity. They seek to live the revolution now, experimen

ting with simplified and shared lifestyles, even while preparing

for the emergence of a mess revolutionary movement.

The small size of the groups helps te maximize individual per-

ticipation and encourages individual and group growth; their

participation in the Movement for a New Society network un

ites them with a larger movement.

Curently groups and individuals are experimenting with the

Movement for a New Society approach in California, Oregon,

Washington, Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana,

Michigon, Kansas, Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryiend,

North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, An exchange of ideas

and resources with the nonviolent movement in Bitain, Japan,

Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand makes

MNS people hopeful of the prospects of a transnational network.

Sisters and Brothers!

With the election year come and gone, and the Indochina war changing its shape, where are

movement people?

Where else, but working, innovating, reflecting, trying to build a movement for real change?

For many of us that's meant getting closer to the grass roots. The Movement for a New Society

is doing that. But there's no sense in getting isolated. For one thing, that's an invitation to

rapression.

(We lost our non-profit mailing privilegas because of a complaint about our news

letter, Dandelion, advocating war tax resistance. Last week Keith Miller of the

Philadelphia Life Center was sentenced to two years for refusing induction. These

things add to our sense of the repression potential in this society.) •

Cine way to prevent isolation is to exchange information on whai we're doing. Enclosed

is our newest effort to say what we're into.

Innovation is pretty important to us. That's partly why some of us laid down A Quaker

Action Group -- however useful it was in the 1930's, its structure and style didn't seem in

novative enough for the 1270's.

So here you'll read where we are in our journey toward a more relevant, more attractive;

more merit it, conscious armine to changing houses sious iron't ol with

our sexism and our old cliches which sometimes substituted for analysis.

We'd be glad for reactions and criticism from you, our comrades in the struggle. There's

a whole lot more wisdom in the movement collectively than in the individual organizations

and activists.

Let's share a and grow, and struggle, and celebrate!

struggle

ON A TOUR OF THE UNITED STATES, Danilo

Dolci, the famous Sicilian grassroots organizer,

was asked what he thinks of nonviolence. He

replied, "I don't believe in nonviolence. " He

paused, and there was time for the audience to

wonder if Dolci had abandoned the nonviolent

approach after so many years of commitment to

it. Then he said, "| believe in nonviolent ac-

tion; I believe in nonviolent revolution. "

Too often the call for "nonviolence" has been a

call for peace at the cost of justice, an effort

to suppress the conflict instead of waging it. If

we acknowledge the gross injustice and the

powerful vested interests in this country, we

must also admit that conflict is necessary for

fundamental change.

Those who profess to favor freedom,.

and yet depreciate agitation, are

men who want crops without thund-

er and lightning. They want the

ocean without the awful roar of its.

waters.. This struggle may be a mo-

ral one; or it may be a physical one;

or it may be both moral and physi-

cal; but it must be a struggle. Pow

er concedes nothing without a dem

and. It never did, and it never

will. Find out just what people will

submit to, and you have found out

the exact amount of injustice

and

wrong which will be imposed upon

them; and these will continue till

they are resisted with either words

or blows, or both.

Struggle begins in a variety of ways. Conflict

may result from building an alternative institu-

- Frederick Douglass, 1857

tion which becomes so threatening that an Est-

ablishment agency tries to harrass or destroy it.

Or it may come when you stop paying your war

taxes or carrying a draft card. Your group may experience repression as it acts in solidarity with

a local union strike or joins in a boycott action. Conflict nearly always comes when you carry out

a deliberate nonviolent campaign for change.

CAMPAIGNING FOR CHANGE

The first step in building a compaign for change is to choose a goal which is consistent with your

analysis of the "big picture" of socici forces. There is little point in working on reformist goals

which have no relation to a long-range strategy for fundamental change.

Second, educate! Focus on the groups most likely to respond, and the groups whose action con

bring about the change. Sireet speaking and other dialogue methods can test your approach to

see if it is sectarian or irrelevant.

## Page 42

Third, organizel Connect the forces on your side to each other; catalyze new relationships which

go-beyond the one-dimensiopal politicking of the Old Order. Lau

, a constructive program, pref-

erably connected to the issu

lou are raising.

Fourth, negotiate! You need to meet the opponent fase-to-fece really to know where things are;

role-play beforehand,, of course. This step con really : larify the situation for all parties.

Fifth (if your goal has not been reached), confront! Reduce the problem and solution to picture

form, so that no words are necessary in order to explain what the confrontation is about. (The

1960 sit-ins in the U.S. South were a good example of that.) The picture should show the gap

between a widely-held value and the particular injustice.

Take group action which paints the pic-

ture in vivid colors. The campaign should build to a crisis, in which the authorities are put in a

dilemma; if they allow the demorstration to go on, fine because the action is dramatically pointing

up the situation of injustice. If they repress the demonstration, all right, because their repression

further reveals the violence on which the institution rests. If they accept the demand, you cele-

brate.

FACING REPRESSION

The government's own force can work against itself, as in jiu-jitsu, when it is met indirectly. In-

stead of pitting guns against repressive violence, meeting the opponents on their superior ground,

the movement responds nonviolently. This often has two effects: it begins the process of demoral-

ization of the police and troops, and it discredits the government in the eyes of the public.

Voluntary suffering is dynamic when we can stand it without fleeing. For most people that requires

preparation. The repression we may experience in struggle is sharing in the suffering already ex-

perienced every day by millions of people, but doing it for change instead of suffering because one

cannot get out of the way.

By changing our ideas about ourselves, by

developing a strategy we have confidence in,

and by training in direct action tactics, we

can get ready for open struggle. By joining

others in small affinity groups we develop the

solidarity necessary to face repression. The

MNS is a network of groups such as NRGs

(Nonviolent Revolutionary Groups) which

practice mutual aid at the "crunch" -- at

the time when it is most needed.

Campaigns for specific change frequently fail

to achieve all their aims. Campaigns, like

alternative institutions, take part of their

meaning from the larger strategic context.

While Rosa Luxemburg may have been exag-

gerating when she said that revolutionists

would lose every battle except the last, her

point is still sound: when we have an overall

strategy for fundamental change, we need not

be discouraged when we do not reach all our

campaign objectives.

Which is more important-national or local action?

Which is more important in a book-the paper or

the ink? Obviously there will be no revolutionary

nonviolent movement in this country without strong

grassroots organization and national struggle. No city

can be transformed unless the nation changes drasti-

cally. Our society cannot be changed neighborhood

by neighborhood.

The false dilemma results from short-sighted

strategy, which either projects a confrontation some-

where (e.g., Washington, DC) and then urges us to

drop everything for that, or digs into a neighborhood

somewhere and forgets about national impact.

Sound strategy links the levels in a multi-level

movement. The strategy underlying the NRG's con-

nects national struggle to grassroots organizing

As an NRG nears the crunch on a significant issue;

resources from the network of groups and communi-

ties can join the struggle to make it successful. Some-

times, the struggle can achieve national or even

international proportions. As Martin Luther King jr.

found in Birmingham and Selma, a national struggie

can grow out of local work, shaking the federal

government from a thousand miles away.

analysis

NEW THREATS TO HUMANITY are coming faster than uld threats are resolved. War, racism,

dictatorship, sexism, exploitation, and hunger are stili with us. But now there is ecological

breakdown.

Shall we try to escape, or to act? In the long run there is no escape. The problems will not go

away. But the first reaction may be only a compiaint, a protest, or a scream of anger and pain.

These spontaneous reactions are like the symptoms in a body's nervous system which reflect dis-

ease or injury. They alert the social body that something is wrong. They do not necessarily tell

us what is wrong or what to do about it.

To discover what is wrong requires analysis. To discover what to do about it requires, first, vision,

and second, strategies for change.. From analysis, vision, and strategy will come actions which

are more than cries of pain, actions which are steps in our liberation.

Analysis is a continuing process. Action based on analysis tests our understanding and puts new

questions to us. Action and analysis should go together. If we insist on having a near-perfect

analysis before we act, we are likely not to act at all; such is the liberal paralysis often found

among academics.

In the summer of 1971 an Education and Action Seminar meeting in Philadelphia studied U.S. aid

to dictatorships. The Seminar soon found itself leading a campaign against supply of arms for Pak-

istan's repression of the Bengalis. Stimulated by the group's blockade of the harbor by canoes and

sailbouts, the longshoremen refused to load materials for Pakistan.

In these Seminars (which were developed by the MNS' Macro-Analysis Collective), each partic-

ipant shares the reading she or he does with the other participants. In this way each individual

profits from a much larger amount of material than he or she could cover in individual study. The

seminar stresses not only the major elements in the present world crisis, but altemative possibil-

ities and strategies of change. Thus the groups get ready to develop campaigns out of a common

analysis. (The manual, "On Organizing Macro-Analysis Seminars," is evailable for 75¢ from the

MNS, 4722 Baltimore Avenue, Philadelphia 1943.)

We believe in participation in developing analysis, vision, and strategy. The Movement for a New

Society has no party line, no leader who tells us what to think. On the other hand, the MNS is not

a coalition which reflects the lowest common denominator of everyone who is concerned about change.

A consensus has been emerging among MNS groups on at least the ouilines of a common analysis.

OUR VIEW OF IT

At least six overarching forces shape this

world with an impact felt even on the

neighborhood level: the ecological crisis,

corporate capitalism, militarism, statism

racism, and sexism.

Modem technology appeared, until rec-

ently, so be an unmixed blessing. After

development, however, we find that for the

profit of a privileged minori

the planet has

been plundered of its precio

resources and

the ecosystem on which our very life depends

is befouled with industrial pollutants. Econ-

omic growth is the altar before which much is

sacrificed. High consumption is offered as

the condition for happiness. The American

middle class level of consumption is the goal

for much of the world.

That goal cannot be reached. Non-renewab-

le resources in metals and fuels are too limited

to allow such a consumption level. Food pro-

duction cannot be increased indefinitely. The

Foy. From

ecosystem cannot tolerate the resulting levels

of pollution. The population of the world is

already too large and is growing at an alarm-

ing rate.

The major organizers of exploitation in the

West are the corporations. Wealth and power

are concentrated in relatively few hands, even

in many societies which call themselves demo-

cratic.. The huge multi-national corporations

are already more powerful than all but a few

nations, and are still growing. They are res-

ponsible to no public; profits for their owners

are their first priority. These corporations,

most of which are linked to the American sup-

er-rich, dominate and impoverish the Third

World. Despite the immense wealth which

flows into the U.S, from overseas, a ghetto

dweller con tell us how little trickles down.

Support for such a system requires a huge mil-

itary machine. It is not an accident that the

United States is first in military might, and

trains and equips most of the armies and po-

lice forces of the world. Militarism in the

U.S. adds to corporate profits at home as

well as preserving corporate access to mark-

eis and raw materials abroad. Military con-

tracts, most of which are awarded without

competitive bidding, provide lucrative prof-

its for industry. Whole communities, large

portions of certain indusiries, and a vast la-

bor force have become dependent on the

maintenance of the military apparatus.

28398420910 32989709 Page 44

Exploitation and militarism are not confined

to capital

countries, of course. Huge ar

mies are mo

used at the border of China and

the Soviet Union, presumably not under the

orders of the bourgeoisie. Moscow has, in

ine name of the proletariat, ruled harshly

over its own workers and those of Eastern

Europe; more than one workers' revolt has

been quelled by Russian tanks. The dis-

ease of statism - whether the bureaucratic

centralism of the Soviet Union or the fascism

of Spain, turns upside down the principle

that the state should serve the people.

* Racism and sexism deny us the benefits of

equal life chances, deny us a common dig-

nity, and foster conflict among peoples who

should be allied against the power elites of

military-industrial societies.

Racism in the United States is strengthened

by unequal opportunities for education and

training. Minorities are at a disadvantage

in competing for jobs in a high unemployment

economy; that, in turn, reinforces patterns

of segregation in housing, churches, and

schools.

Rigid sex role definitions trap both men and

women. Women work hard and are supportive

to children and men, a: a high cost to them-

selves. Women are expected ic defer to male

initiative and to limit their horizons to home

and child care. Men are expected to be con-

petitive, stoical, eager to leave the nest each

morning to earn the bread. Persons of either

sex who do not fit easily into these definitions

have hard going, and if they grow to love

members of their own sex, the discrimination

against them is compounded.

Corporate capitalism, militarism, statism,

ecological crisis, racism, sexist -- these

are some of the pervasive realities of pres

ent society. They invite the disincegrution

or sudden destruciion of this sociely within

a few decades. Whether & new society con

emerge depends on our cellity is enwision

new institutions and develop life centered

strategies for building them.

vision

SOCIAL CHANGE MOVEMENTS OF THE LAST DECADE have often spelled out some specific

goals for a berter society: racial equality, peace in Vietram, women's rights, clean air. But

their vision has rarely broadened beyond a single issue.

In the shori run, there are advantages to the single isue agpreach. But a new sociery cannoi be

built that way.

The problems are connected to a cirusiur: of power which strongly resisis neaning

ful change. The goals are connecied to each orle: in a way that reduces the chance of reaching

inem one at a time. Further, thare is the ferce of nitiliam of cultural emptiness em waich cor

lions need to coine together in a vision which offers hora aid life. Withou a vision, tho people

perish because we need a vision to sustain us through the hard times of struggle.

You need men and women with years of experiencin

farmins, sinall business, teaching. city plauning, recre-

ation. medicine, and on and on-to start discussine and

writing about ways to organize that part of society they

Know best. ... You need to provide cuticts via forums, dis

cussions, papers and magazines for the pest-up plans and

ideals at literally millions of well-trained, esperienced,

frustrated Americans who see stupidity and sreed all

around them but can'tdo a thing about it.

You need to say, for example, "Look, Mr. and Mrs.

HOW WE SEE IT

*There is among MNS paople a growing consensus on some of this outline. We see a new society

noi as a rigid utopia free of conflict, but a place of life and joy and movement. It should value

women and men, blacks and whites, adults and children, intellectuals and manual workers equal

ly. A variety of life-centered cultures will exist rather than a homogeneous mass. Access to

es it ex children,

knowledge and art will be a right. Celebration and self-discipline will have new meaning in a

milieu which serves human liberation.

Human beings must live in harmony with the earth. This probably means a zero growih rate in the

near future for both industrial production and popularion, with the utmost use of recycled materials

and non-polluting sources of energy. This will mean a decreased level of consumption for most

Americans, who have been using far more than our share of world maierial and enargy resources.

Economic enterprises should be socially owned, decentralized, and democratically controlled,

Workers cordiol is feasible when the enterpiises are not enormous; participation by consumers

in decision-making is also important in some produciive units. The object of production will be

social use rather than private profiï. Alienation from labor will be minimized by sharing routine,

repetitive work, by participaring in decisions about the product, and by co-ownership of the

enterprise.

The spread of incomes will be reduced, perhaps to a ratio of 4 to I for maximum-to-minimum

incomes, in other words, there will be no rich as well as no poor, Basic needs for food, shelter,

medical care, education, and mass transpori will be met free or at low coste Income must be

cored; it cannot come from the labor of others.

Desisions would be made by parricipative, democratic means. Politics would be based on the

foozio-face community of citizens, extending upward to the global level. Transnational insie

flutions will deal with humankind-sized functiens (such as the development of the sea-bed), bui

the emphasis will be on decentralizing all possible acrivities for the sake of democracy. Nation

stares as we now know them will cease to exist.

Thare will ba less cause for mass, organized violence when wealth is redistributed and racism

rested out of institutions. Conflicis will inevilably arise, however, and when they break inio

ire epon will be foughi with nonviolent means of struggle such as noncooperation and bodily

tit ined iniervention.

THE QUALITY OF LIFE WILL INCREASE for nearly cveryone, even while the sheer quantity of

uyuliances and gadgeis will decrease. The crime which is spawned by poverty and cultural emplo

he will no longer haunt our streets. The consumer goods we do own will not wear out quickly.

The air and water will be clean; stars again will be clear in the city skies. We will not be torn

-st by wor. The possibiliry of inflation and unemployment will not worry us. Assured health

c: will fron us of much anxiety. Work will regain its meaning, and leisure will be more orca

18: & because of increased access to cultural geods and to each other.

training for nonviolent

social change

LEARNING IS NOT NEUTRAL. It serves either to domesticate us, or to liberate us. Nonviolence

training is a leaming process. Its goal is to facilitate human liberation - to bring about fundamen-

tal and empowering change.

Essential to this learning for change is the process of "consciousness-raising, " which involves a rad-

ical change in the way we view ourselves as individuals in the present society, and as participants

in the historical process. For reality is not a set of conditions which surrounds us and controls us,

and to which we must resign ourselves, but reality is an ever-transforming process which we are

creating. Until we recognize this power and this responsibility, we cannot bring about any funda-

mental change. But once we come to this realization and begin to live our new awareness, action

to change the world becomes a necessity.

Nonviolence training can have a number of different emphases:

1. PREPARING FOR DIRECT ACTION PROJECTS. Historically, this is how training is best known.

Participants in integration sit-ins organized by

the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in the 1940s were required to attend evening workshops, in-

cluding discussions of fears and feelings and roleplaying of anticipated experiences. In the 1960s

"marshals" were trained in methods of nonviolent crowd control for large anti-war demonstrations in

Washington, D.C. By 1972, the emphasis had switched to "participant training" = preparing as

many participants as possible to take responsibility.

Training for nonviolent direct action can now include choosing tactics, working out logistics, and

preparing participants. Preparation can include roleplaying, brainstorming, guerrilla theatre, and

other exercises. *

2. BUILDING A MORE SUSTAINED MOVEMENT. The People's Blockade of arms to Indochina be-

gan when a small group of individuals came to-

gether to translate their concern about the war into an envisioned action. Brainstorming and strategy-

gaming were especially helpful as they developed a campaign. Training for larger numbers of parti-

cipants took place during the actual campaign, and helped it to grow nationally. Other groups have

found scenario-writing important in developing long-range strategy.

3. EXPLORING ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENCE IN OUR LIVES. Nonviolence training has played an

important role in the development

of neighborhood block safety programs in West Philadelphia, the highest drug crime rate area in the

city. Through werkshops, many residents found alternatives to calling on police and to responding

to violence with violence. The new ways were not on ly morally more desirable, but also enabled

Olson and Shivers, and the Trainers Kit (bibliography).

them to feel more confideni

out neighborhood safety. The work

os also served an important

• community-building function.

It is imporiant to be aware that "nonviolence" cannot assure a safe escape from a volatile situation

(nor can violence!), "but many positive nonviolent responses can present themselves if we insist on

relating to others as human beings, in spite of our fear or anger.

4. RAISING OUT LEVEL OF AWARENESS ABOUT OURSELVES AND THE WAYS IN WHICH WE

INTERACT. Observation and group dynamics exercises make us more aware of the dynamics

operating in groups, and more sensitive to group task and maintenance needs. Role-

playing can make us more aware of our own behavior tendencies. Listening exercises and trust games

sensitize us. A careful evaluation and discussion bring out possibilities for change.

Alienation often results from rigid role expectations based on sex, race, or age. Training processes

can be helpful in enabling us to identify these feelings of alienation, understand them better, and

change them.

Nonviolence training has learned much from re-evaluation counseling, ransactional analysis, and

sensitivity training as reaffirmation of individual worth is incorporated into training workshops.

5. LEARNING ABOUT NONVIOLENT THEORY AND STRUGGLE. Past nonviolent struggles can

inspire us to action, and suggest

us he organis onion ree eti impost es of eh in on us the violent

history in workshops and discussion groups. In Japan recently, training groups tried developing their

own strategy given an historical sitution, and then compared it to what actually happened. Training

exercises help to introduce nonviolent theory in the context of a real conflict situation.

6. SHARING SPECIFIC SKILLS. This could include leaming to facilitate training workshops them-

selves, as well as running a mimeograph machine, chairing a meet-

ing, changing diapers, taking pictures, baking bread, and others. These tasks are a valuable part

of building a movement and a new society. When knowledge and responsibility are shared, the like-

lihood of drudgery or "meaningless labor" are lessened greatly. In this sense, training is a democra-

fizing process.

Training for nonviolent social change occurs through involvement in all aspects of the Movement for

a New Scciety. Life Centers, which are now taking form in several places, offer not only partic-

ipation in a series of workshops dealing with various aspects of social change, but also involvement

in direct action, community, and alternative institutions. Training structures often become a regul-

ar part of sharing and decision-making processes. Shorter-term workshops are facilitated by several

training collectives, with areas of concern and amount of time depending on the interests and needs

of the group. Groups which have participated in nonviolent training have include university groups,

anti-war groups, organizational staff, high school students, church groups, and even a group of vol-

unieer nursing home visitors. •

community

People who are working for radical social change often feel insecure in

our present day world. Our values and priorities are being challenged

and changed. Institutions are crumbling. The ecological crisis is

closing in on us. Nuclear weapons are proliferating. Political

repression is around the corner. It is all so overwhelming and

confusing.

Activists need to come together to guard against despair - to help each other to

sry and to find the occasions for laughter. We need to stimulate each others' imag-

inctions of what the future can be and of how we can get there.

We need to simp-

lify and organize our life together so there is time for confrontations that are needed

if the old order is to fall.

Leoming to live contentedly without high consumption goes against the grain of

our culture, but is possible in the context of community. Incomes can be cut if

every family does not have to have its own laundry facilities, tools, automobiles,

houses, etc. Concern for the ecosystem adds to the need for developing a simple

yet adequate life style. Simplifying our lives also means pruning our scatter of ac-

tivities to focus energy and to provide time to be present to each other. Many peo-

ple are finding their present occupations incompatible with their life goals and with

the way they like to live. As part of a community it becomes more possible to risk

making radical changes in employment.

Several forms of community are developing within the Movement for a New Society network, In

one any levin iu study foe to india po fore ho commie beforly, but in vinich out of eh other:

grew common action. At the same time individuals often share personal experience, problems and

joys, They offer practical help to each other (food-buying, child care, transportation) and may

even move into the same neighborhood.

Other people in the MNS are sharing homes together. A family finds another family, or they may

preter to share with people who have no children of their own. Single, young people may fill a

house, or the commune may be composed of people of various ages. One house we know has ten

people ranging from age 16 to 58, with one married couple, one couple that is not married, and

six singles.

In some places clusters of communes and individuals form a wider community of people moving in

the same direction. When such clustering is deliberate the community can have a rich variety of

special interests, talents, temperaments and lifestyles - and yet maintain a feeling of belonging

and common cause.

In is not easy to build a community, of half a dozen people or of many times more. Most sf us are

rtored to be individualistic and rather egocentric and have trouble coordinating our daily routines

ith those of other people. We are used to making decisions on our own and find it hard to remem

bar to check important matters out with our community. Some of us find it difficult to be open about

was financial situation or about the fact that we need help with personal as well as practical prob-

We struggle to find ways to express disagreements and a noyances in honest but helpful ways. For

those who live communally there are the inevitable questions of housekeeping standards, child care,

expenses, and time devoted to development of a close comunity as opposed to time devoted to the

world "out there." And then, of course, there is the question of intimacy. As people leam to

share on a deeply personal level, it is safe to assume that sexual feelings arise.

CONFLICT IS NATURAL

The first step toward solving problems in a community is to recognize that conflict is natural and

inevitable. It may even be desirable in order for the community to grow in depth and commitment.

However, most communities that we know find it necessary to establish procedures for dealing with

problems as they come up. Regular meetings (e.g. weekly housemeetings in communes) are essen-

tial to prevent annoyances from growing into problems. Also, without common planning there will

be misunderstandings and uneven sharing of work. Before community members feel comfortable

enough with each other to express negative feelings, short periods set aside for "gripes" can be use-

ful. In addition to providing a safe way to express conflict, communities find it useful to do things

together that bring out their common joy and a sense of belonging.

We are excited about struggling to find the answers that are right for us at this time. Our vision of

a new society is helpful as a framework for finding better ways of recting to each other now.

Since our vision of the future includes egalifarian and decentralized decision-making structures,

MNS communities do not develop around "gurus." Rather, conscious eiforis ore being made to en-

courage full and free participation by everyone. Training in nonviolent action and knowledge of

group dynamics give us useful ways of dealing with problems of leadership, reticence, ambiguity of

goals, etc. People with leadership qualities

are a valuable asset to a community, but such

ability should not carry any special privilege.

Since we are working toward a non-sexist soc-

iety it is clearly impossible to divide the work

of the community along traditional sex lines.

We are not trying to reverse the roles of men

and women or to erase leadership abilities or to

suppress individual differences. We are, how

ever, pressing for equal sharing between men

and women of family maintenance tasks, of com

munity participation and of breadwinning.

Communities often last only a short time, but

then longevity is not necessarily a sign of suc-

cess. A community will have succeeded if the

participants leave each other as more integra-

ted people than when they came together, more

able to cry and laugh and struggle with others,

and with more skills and inspiration to carty on

the revolution.

Nonviolent revolution is a meaningless concepi

as long as the present institutions have such a

stranglehold on our lives, Protesting lei. To's

interference in the affairs of Chile while con-

rinuing to buy Wonderoread, calling for aca

demic freedom while allowing the universities

to be funded by big business and the Depart

ment of Defence, and talking about socialism

while not struggling to take control over worko

ing conditions, are futile gestures.

The majority of us through working and consum-

ing actively build the system as it exisis today.

Alternative institutions provide us with a way of

breaking this stranglehold, enabling us io take

power into our own hands.

At their best thay

also provide us with working medals of what

life in the new society can be like.

Recent years have seen a greal proliferation of

alterrative institutions. There are few areas of

either production, distribution, or service in

which experiments are not being made.

Free universities in both the United States and

Europe offer courses the established universities

do not, and experiment with different methods

of learning. An interesting alternative school

is the Scotland Road Free School in Liverpool,

i England. It is operated by the children and

community, and atiracts truants from the reg

ular schools.

The Community Associares Printing Collective

is an MNS group in Philadelphia. Members of

the collective share skills and make decisions

by means of consensus. The Scort Bader Com

monwealth is a worker-conrolled chemical

factory in England with gross sales in the mil

There con be few cities now without at least

one food co-op. At the Whole Earth Learning

Community in Madison, Wisconsin, the small

paid staff is rotated every six months so that

more people can learn the skills. Former

staff are encouraged to carry the store's phil-

osophy to other areas.

The Neighborhood Repair Group in Philadel-

phia offers home repair and decorating ser-

vices to the community as well as income to

it's members. Both skilled and unskilled mem-

bers go out on each job so that skills are

shared. Vocations for Social Change groups

give guidance to people who want to work in

alternative institutions and in other non-ex-

ploitative types of work. In Britain, Uncar-

eers provides the same type of service.

Among the many other types of alternative

institutions are: child care co-ops, skills

co-ops, alternative pharmacies and health

care clinics, land trusts and credit unions,

crafts collectives and book co-ops.

To make work more human and satisfying, al-

ternative institutions must experiment serious

ly with organizational forms, collective work-

ing and skills sharing. To avoid hierarchy

and outside financial control only those who

work in them should take part in desision-

making, In food co-ops, fer instance, each

member should share the work as well as the

benefits. Otherwise the co-op is merely a

money saving club; this happened to many

of the older co-ops both in Britain and U.S.

To be politically relevant alternative institu

tions need to develop an analysis of estab-

lished institutions and a programme to chal-

lenge them. Alternatives people need to join

others in a movement for revolutionary social

change. Wherever possible alternative insti-

tutions should relate to activist groups involved

in immediate confrontation campaigns and

should be flexible enough to free members to

take part in these. During the People's Block-

ade, the Ploughshares Co-operative Restaurant

and Bread Company in Washington State releas

ed a member to take part in the Blockede and

supplied those taking, part in the action with

food.

Our ultimate vision is one in which alternative

institutions are able to produce, transport, and

distribute all necessary and useful goods. They

will meet more and more of our social needs.

In that way existing institutions lose their grip

on us. Long before we reach this stage the

existing institutions will feel threatened and

will try to repress the alternatives. To prevent

this repression from being effective, alternative

institutions need to cooperate and support each

other. This is beginning in Madison, Wisconsin,

where cooperatives have set up a sustaining

fund.

The Movement for a New Society strengthens

this community of support and solidarity by

connecting alternative institutions with other

important aspects of the social change move-

ment.

LIFE CENTERS are larger c

mmunities with the primary purpose or preparing effective social

change agents. The intensive learning experience invelves workshops on various aspects of the

revolution, participation in direct action projects, and the experience of living in a community

based on changed lives and changed values.

OTHERS: Innovative forms of collective organization are being developed to suit the function

and needs of particular groups.

The Movement for a New Society is still in formation. The network is being developed on several

levels - local, regional, and continental - with each small group participating in the discussions

and decision-making at each level. Two ways this happens is in the network meetings and in the

more informal gatherings sometimes called celebrations.

Celebrations are times of sharing joys and sadnesses, music, food, dancing, and discovering and

strengthening the spirit of community. They occur both locally and on a larger scale.

The first continental network meeting, involving MNS people from California to Maine to Florida,

was held in Madison, Wisconsin, in November, 1972. Regional and local network meetings are

either functioning or foreseen.

Although the meetings are open to anyone, delegates from each

MNS group are expected.

Decisions in the network are made by consensus, a decision-making process that depends on a

group reaching general agreement rather than voting. By using consensus, people explore issues

more carefully and are more sensitive to each others' feelings; the decisions are more likely to

be mutually satisfactory.

The "office" of the continental Movement for a New Society is presently in Philadelphia, and is

maintained by the Continental Movement-Building Collective. This group has the particular task

of facilitating communication throughout the network, but also it promotes MNS ideas, stimulates

new groups to form, and raises funds. MNS groups are working to share the responsibilities of the

Continental Movement-Building Collective. We hope that the collective's members will be repre-

sentative of the whole network, both geographically and in range of interest and experience.

Groups wanting to join the Movement for a New Society are referred to the MNS group geograph-

ically closest to them, for exploration of what is involved in joining the network.

Discussions on our structure are continuing within the MNS; we are mindful of how we grow and the

influence of structures on us as persons. In common with others working for social change, we seek

to plant the seeds of democratic work and life now to increase the chance of an egalitarian new socie

of the future.

Dear Friends:

The trips to Cuba planned for the past summer were postponed when

the Cuban government asked us to delay application for the visas until

late fall or early winter. The reason stated was that there were already

too many Quaker groups coming to fuba in the summer.

A Quaker action Group's Latin America Committee has decided not to

proceed with the plans for the summer workcamp idea but we are still

planning to approach the Cubans with our proposal for a project to

challange the economic boycott on Cuba. While the specific arrangements

and details of the project may change during the negotiations with the

the Cubans, the general idea is for a team of about 8 people to sail to

Cuba with a gift of medical textbooks or some other desired item.

Possibly, these Cuban people's organizations will send a gift to the

poor people of the United States.

The team would bring the gift back

to be distributed by a poor people's organization here. As you can.

tell, the plans are not detailed but are open to discussion and change

when meeting with the Cubans.

The boat, LAVENGRO is now in florida ready and waiting for the plans

„for the economic boycott project to proceed.

The captain, Robert Wilson

is keeping the Lavengro ready to sail.. In the next week or so,

representatives from AQAG plan to meet. with our Cuban contact to reopen

negotiations on the project.

I am presently doing research on Puerto Rico and the Guantaneno Base as

these are two places where other Latin American projects would be

affective, and where the United Statès plays an obvious role.

Your ideas

concerning future projects in Latip America would be appreciated,

There has not been much communication about Latin imerica recently

because I have been in Mexico for 6 weeks, studying Spanish and traveling.

I hope to keep you better infofned of developments concerning, out latin

imerica program in the future.

DATE: 2/27/70

(00: PHILADELPHIA)

Re Miami letter to the Bureau dated 1/14/70.

Boat Yard, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and under the control of, '

ROBERI D. WILSON.

Customs advised that WILSON is a close friend and

associate of SCOTT HERRICK, owner of the yacht "Mondcivitano."

The "Mondcivitano" is also at the same boat yard and is

scheduled to go in drydock for painting and repairs in the

near future.

It is noted that SCOTT HERRICK is a member of the'

executive committee of Committee for Non-Violent Action and

is an active pacifist..

Customs feels that WILSON would not go to Cuba

without HERRICK but, if they did go, it is not known at this

time if they would take one or two boats.. Customs feels

that, inasmuch as HERRICK's boat is going into drydock,

neither boat would depart from the U.s. for at least a month

A review of the Bureau file on captioned organization

with regard to the proposed travel to Cuba by representatives

Of AQAG discloses no information has been developed regarding

this matter since the Fall of 1969. At that time AQAG advised

its adherents that the Cuban Government requested a delay in

the application for visas by potential participants.

Each recipient contact logical informants and sources

to determine it this group intends to sponsor a trip to cuba

at any time in the near future.

Any positive intormation

NOTE:

AQAG orignally planned to sponsor the trip of a

group to Cuba during October, 1969, and appropriate instructions

were issued to the field to determine circumstances surrounding

this travel. At the request of the Cuban Government, the AQAG

postponed its proposed travel as there were too many quaker

groups going to Cuba last summer. The above inquiry to recipient

offices is necessary to clarify the current status of this

situation.

WIATEVER HAPPENED TO ARTICLE I?

The founding fathers recognized that wartime

circusstances could dangerously encourge the con-

centration of power in the chief executive, eroding

the intendad control by the people's representatives.

So Article I gives Congress alone the power to de-

clare war, and both Houses must concur. Congress

Ilkewire is given control over wai-supporting appro

priations, principally as a check to Executive

archority.

CONGRESS HAS BICOLE A RUSBER STAMP

• By giving its power to the Executive Branch

- And veconing the "Silent Minority"

WIIO MAKES DECISIONS FOR WAR OR PEACE

IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH?

It seems the Gonerals make most of those de

cisions with the consent of the President. But

it isn't just the Generals in the Pentagon.

Conerals Thieu and Ky seem to make many decisions

with the consert of the Pentagon Generalão .

be withdrawn from Cambodia by'June 30

In addition to conventional weapons the United

WHY

we.

We see the military effort of the United States

in Southeast

Asia as a deláberate genocidal policy against the Vietnamese

people, Herbicides and defoliants have killed a large percentage

of crops resulting in starvation mostly among civilians.

CS, CN, DM are used to flush whole villages out of their shelters

where they can be bombed. Studies have shown that poisoning and

extreme birth defects result from some of these chemicals.

WASHNGTON WEEKLY ACTION

Each Friday at noon we plan to engage in Nonviolent Direct

Action at the centers of death in lashington.

These actions

will involve civil disobedience as we seek immediate with

drawal of U.S. military forces from all of Indo-China.

particular, we will be focusing our actions against the ai-

senal of Chemical and Biological Weapons which allow the

United States to continue this war.

CBN is especially im

portant to our country's imperialist foreign policy, as the

United States could noy continue its program of limited

wars in this atomic age without Chemical and Biological

weapons.

We must keep the heat on Washington: On Junes we demon -

strated with street theater on the Capitol steps the hor-

rible reality of CB as used in Vietnam. On June 12 we

both the people and the tree they

carried

were arrested at the entrance

for trespassing.

A STRATEGY FOR CHANGE

Democratic processes in the United

States have

deteriorated and the power

military-indusirial complex has

increased.

Conventional

means of pro-

proved inadequate

without an added rover.

Some

have

turned to violent

means for that added

power.

It is our conviction that noi

violent action of a

Gandhian character,

which includes civil disobedience

can provide the moral

power to end the Vietnam War

was making arrangements to contact United States Attorney, Mr.

Stanley B. Miller, Indianapolis, Indiana, and advise him fully

of the situation in order that protection of the facility might

be handled through the use of United States Marshals:

On September 29,1970, a second source, with whom'in-

sufficient contact has been made to establish reliability but who

was in a position to know, volunteered that an organizational

meeting of the Indiana State University Student Mobilization

Committee had been held at 7 pm on September 29, 1970, on the

Indiana State University Campus. Approximately 131 individuals!

were in attendance. Although organization was attempted, it was.

unsuccessful as too many different diverted views were proposed

by those attending. No leadership was actually elected or

established at this meeting. This source further advised that

three to four unknown students from Indiana University at Bloom-

ington, Indiana, were in attendance at this meeting and also

sought

unsuccessfully to organize Student Mobilization Committee

at Indiana State University. The various speakers attending this

organizational meeting openly advised the gathered group that it

was the proposed plan to make Terre Haute, Indiana, a focal point

of anti-war activity in Indiana on October 3, 1970. The same.

speakers expressed knowledge that supporting students from other

Indiana Universities and Colleges had vowed their participation

along with Indiana State University students, in this demonstra-

tion.

At this time, the plans the anti-war

rally included

picnics, speeches, music, and a door-to-door canvass of Terre

Haute residents concerning their feelings towards the Vietnamese

war.

Hopes were also expressed by these speakers that the

residents of Terre Haute, Indiana, would include their signatures

on anti-war petitions to be circulated in the city on that date.

Literature distributed during this meeting indicated that the.

Womens International League for Peace and Freedom, Student

Mobilization Committee, the Indiana Peace and Freedom Party, and

Hopper's Bizarre were the acknowledged sponsors of this peace

rally on October 3, 1970. No violence was advocated during this

initial meeting.

On September 30, 1970,

Roscoe Barger, supra, advised.

Barbara Norman had been notified of the United States Army's

decision. September 29, 1970, to allow the planting of a tree '"of

life" on

the Newport Army Ammunition Facility grounds. During

this contact, Norman agreed fully to comply with rules set forth

by the Newport Facility in the conduct of this demonstration.'

At this time, Norman stated she proposed to plant "tree of life"

contacted were in agreement with the proposed demonstration.

This same paper also alleged that a few members of the Chicago

Conspirators were to be among those scheduled to speak at the

peace rally. Although this paper indicated potential demonstrators

numbered 6,000, this source felt that the maximum number which

would probably attend the October 3, 1970, rally in Terre Haute

would not exceed 600 individuals.

It was

further noted by this

source that the "street sheet" dealt largely in unsupported

fact and rumor.

Between 10 am and 1 pm on October 3, 1970, 50 to 75

individuals gathered at Fairbanks Park, Terre Haute,

Indiana,

where an information booth had been established on this same date

in order to serve as a coordinating point for the anti-war

activities to occur in Terre Haute on this date. Individuals

who gathered at this booth during this period of time proceeded

into the Terre Haute residential area with literature of anti-

war nature and also attempted to canvass Terre Haute residence

in reference to their opinions towards the Vietnam War.

¿..At 1 pm, approximately 125 to 150 individuals again

gathered at fairbanks Park, for a picnic and speeches:

The

speeches, according to Detective Richard Settift Of the Terre

Haute Police Department were largely anti-war but were non- . '

violent. The only individuals specifically remembered by Setliff

as a speaker was Finley Campbell of the Indiana Peace and Freedon

Party.

At 3:30 pm on this same date, approximately the same

number of individuals gathered about, proceeded from Fairbanks

Park into the downtown Terre Haute area. This group proceeded

down the main street, Wabash Avenue, and turned South on Seventh

Street, again proceeded out of the downtown area on Ohio Street,

eventually terminating march at Fairbanks Park. By 5 pm, this

permit and park use permit had been provided by the City of

Terre Haute, the parade was marshalled and preceded by units

• from the Terre Haute Police Department. Although the crowd

chanted anti-war slogans throughout its march, no violence or

incidents occurred. The entire day's activities appeared well

marshalled by group leaders.

According to Ted Melvin, Chief of Police, City of

Terre Haute, Indiana, there was no indication that there were,

large number of students from other Indiana Univarsities present

fór the activities ön the October 3, 1970. It, was further stated

by Melvin that if petitions had been circulated in the City of

Terre Haute in an attempt to secure signatures of Terre Haute:

residents, this operation had been of such small scale that it

had been totally unnoticed by his department. Complaints had

not been received from citizens and no arrests were made throughout

the day's activities. Theré was also no indication that any

members of the Chicago Conspirators had been present during the

peace rally as speakers..

On October 4, 1970, at 1:30 pm, eleven individuals,

including in this total

two children, arrived at the Newport

Army Anmunition Plant, Newport, Indiana and announced themselves!

as representatives in the Quaker Action Group and the Womens

Barbara Norman

was in charge and she, along with the other individuals present

proceeded to plant two small trees in a pre-arranged location on

the Newport Army Anmunition Plant grounds located approximately

200 yards inside these grounds and 40 yards north of the main

A small blue Spruce

A Quaker Action Group

information in the past, advised on December 15, 1970, that

demonstrations are scheduled to take place on the island of

Culebra, which is used by the Atlantic Fleet of the United States

Navy for target practice, in late December, 1970 through January

and

February, 1971.

The source stated that activists in Culebra have

organized various forms of resistance to the Navy..

"Swim-ins"

and

"stand-ins" on beaches have attempted to stop

the bombing and

shelling.

Contacts have been made with United States radical

groups; in particular A Quaker Action Group (AQAG). This group

has been involved in illegal actions in the past such as the

disruptive actions in the Panama Canal Zone in March, 1969.

NOW,

a..ong with members of the War Resisters League (WRI),

they are

organizing an operation which has, as its ultimate objective,

the elimination of United States control over Culebra. The

"three dimensions" of this project are:

1. The "rebuilding of a chapel which the Navy

destroyed".

2. Staged peaceful confrontations with Naval

personnel in Puerto Rico and the Mainland urging them to "support

self-determination for Puerto Ricans and Vietnamese"

At 10 a.m. on 3/11/71 an unknown individual tele-

phonically contacted the Bureau and furnished the following

information:

This individual stated he had originally contacted

CIAland was referred to the Bureau.

During the early a.m.

of 3/11/71 he was invited by one Jaime Fernandez, who identified

himself as a Chilean member of a Quaker Action Group, to

attend a meeting concerning the "Culebra" at 1l a.n. 3/11/71

at 515 East Capital Street, Washington, D. C. (William Penn

House) •

Fernandez allegedly advised that an American girl,

margaxet Delarco, was to speak at this meeting concerning the

Imprisonment of "MPI" people and would also speak concerning

new plans of action scheduled for 3/15/71.

The individual who called the Bureau had a definite

Spanish accent, spoke English well, and stated-he was an

ex-serviceman who was definitely pro-American. He refused to

disclose his identity.

Above information was telephonically furnished to

demonstrated in Washington, D. C. (WDC) against the bombing)

of the island of Culebra off Puerto Rico.

WFO has not covered meetings held within the

-indemnify the Culebrans,

-rescind Presidential Order 8684

AS

GOD 1S

"I am in court today with my broth-

its for staying in the target zone on

Culebra after being ordered to leave

ind for refusing to come to this court

o show cause why I should not be held

n contempt for refusing to leave the

arget area when ordered. I acted as a

representative of A Quaker Action

Group which sent a group of us to Cul-

ebra, but am responsible to myself for

what 1 did, as God is my judge. I acted

snowingly in disobedience of

those

orders because they seek to justify the

expropriation of the land of Culebra

and to restrict the free use of Culebra

by its people, and because they try to

protect the bombing on Culebra from

he accusing voice of humanity, which

has seen too much killing.

"The orders of this court, and the

fences which seek to enforce those

orders, cannot hide from us the fact

that Culebra is used for the testing of.

weapons that destroy human flesh in

Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia. We

know, too, that men are trained here to

kill-not only men. from the U.S. but

Canadians, British, Dutch, Venezuelans,

Dominicans, and Brazilians learn to kill

their brothers on the island of Culebra.

But Jesus has commanded that we love

our brothers and be reconcicr' to them.

JUDGE...

"My people, the Quakers, have al-

ways insisted that God is to be obeyed

and not men, and that we are neither

to be satisfied with the state of things,

nor with a promise of salvation in the

hereafter, but live as though the King-

dom were already here-without doing

violence or harming our brother. They

refused to own their brothers as slaves,

refused to kill or to pay taxes to kill—

for

example,

my, greaf-great-grand-

father, Lloyd Balderston, refused to pay

war taxes during the Civil War and the

government expropriated several of his

hogs. The Quakers have fallen with the

rest of the Babylonians, but there is a

remnant which seeks to recall the voice

of Jesus to the Society of Friends, and I

think that we of A Quaker Action

Group seek to act for that remnant and

to find once more the spirit of the early

Christians and the early Friends.

Balderston

supplics in violation of the law against

'trading with the enemy,' and thus I

have refused to register for war, and

last year refused to pay the ten percent

war tax on telephones. Now some of us

come to Puerto Rico to learn about the

struggle for independence here, to join

in the struggle when it becomes ap

propriate, as it did on Culebra,

and

then to go home, to help the people of

the United States to understand that the

conduct of our nation in Puerto Rico,

in Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia, in

Okinawa,

and in the United States it-

self, is an offense to God and to man.

"In seeking the will of Jesus for our

time, some of us have been led to break

the laws of the United States—thus A

Quaker Action Group sent the sailboat

Phoenix to North Vietnam with medical

"I call upon the people of the United

States to repent of these wrongs, to turn

away from them-to leave Puerto Rico

Ifree and unassociated, to let free the

other vast areas of the world we have

subjugated. We must rediscover the

humility, the willingness to take suffer-

ing upon ourselves rather than inflicting

• it on our brothers and sisters, and the

faith of our Lord Jesus who told us to

take all that we have and give it to the

poor, to do unto others as we would

have others do unto us, and to love one

another, even as He loved us."

• TO DISOBEY

E LAW OF THE EMPIRE...

3

Ruben Berrios

o disobey the law of the empire is to obey the law of the country. We

ave disobeyed the law of the empire.

We acknowledge that we have intentionally violated a Federal order

nd that we have interrupted the Navy bombardment of Puerto Rican territory

Our action is not isolated: It is part of

patriotic movement directed toward eliminating arbitrary and unjust fed- •

ral authority over Puerto Rico, including the power of this tribunal which

omes from the Congress of the United States and not from the people of

uerto Rico.

By violating this federal order, we exercise a profound moral respon

ibility as men and a deeply-felt patriotic responsibility as ruerto

i cans.

Moreover, we are announcing our intention of disobeying whatever

violation we consider necessary to fufill our responsi

From the moral point of view, as men who believe in freedom, our

udge is our own conscience.

For

us, as Jose Marti said:

"A man who con-

ients himself with obeying unjust laws and who permits men who mistreat the

country in which he was born to set foot there, is not an honorable man."

secause we are honorable men we are violating the order of this court.

sefore the tribunal. of our conscience, an honorable man is always innocent...

From the patriotic point of view, in the republic (the U.S.) law is

order; in the colony (Puerto Rico) law is tyranny. Order is necessary to

suman life; :tyranny makes human life impossible...

From the point of view of our civilization,

, the disobeying or violation

if immoral and unjust laws has its foundation in the most noble aspect of

sur inheritance.

Isaiah, in violation of the laws of his epoch, walked

laked and unshod for three years among his people protesting the imperial

era of Ethopia, Egypt and Syria.

Daniel preferred to disobey the mandate

of the emperor

of Babylonia and

to be sent to the lions den rather than

transgress the laws of his,conscience.

And Christ taught us that the law

should not be obeyed when the juridicial system is against man.

"The Sabbath

vas made for man and not man for the Sabbath."

True to his work, Christ

violated Jewish and Roman laws...

It is within this noble tradition that, humbly but firmly, we have dir

acted our actions.

U.S. military operations are so vast,

and Culebra so small, why does AQAG

focus on this microcosm?

Spain, the U.S: has used large parts o

of the islands for military purposes.

•In World War II Culebra was made a

"Naval Defensive Sea Area."

In the early '60's maneuvers and tar-

get practice in Culebra were extended

as the U.S. became further involved

in Vietnam. The Navy agreed under

• pressure in early 1970 to restrict

bombings around the town of Culebra,

but intensified exercises elsewhere

around the island.

Fishing dropped

off; accidents occurred.

Inaccessi-

bility of beaches, inaccuracy of shel-

ling notices, loud

firing noises late

into the night causing anxiety in

children - all of these culminated

in the beginning of. direct action.

In January 1971 the Navy negotiated an

agreement with Culebra's mayor prom-

ising in effect that it would not try

to take over the whole island. While

this was a victory of sorts for Cul-

ebrans, it did not end their being

part oi a bombing target.

We are

later we

were back on the Capital steps, reading the names of the Vietnam

After more arrests, U.S. Congressmen began

to join us in civil disobedience, helping to bring Vietnam into public

OUR GOAI is community -- on a local level, and on a world level. Our staff

our American skins and to build the transnational movement so badly needed

to stop the rampaging military-industrial complex.

revolutionaries in life style as well as political action.

our participati

in the mass anti-war movement is colored by this concern for deepening;

we have been a center of development of training for nonviolent action,

and we are winding up a two-year study of the American system and how it

can be fundamentally transformed by nonviolent means.

STUDENTS FOR A DIMOCRATIC SOCIETY

Students for a Democratic Society; commonly

known as SDS, came into existence at a founding convention

held during June, ^1962, at Port Huron, Michigan. Exom an

initial posture of "participatory democracy," Marxist

Leninist ideology of various shadings became predominant

during 1968-1969 with debate centering on how best to create

a revolutionary youth movement. SDS moved from involvement

in the civil rights struggle to an anti-Vietnam war position

to advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist line linking up

the oppressed peoples of Asia, airica and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

All major factionsewithin SDS embrace Marxism-leninism

and identify internationally with China, Cuba and North Vietnam

as countries leading

• the worldwide struggles against the

United States.

However,

the Soviet Union was regarded as

imperialist and with the Communist Party, United States 01

America, "revisionist" in

nature..

SDS operated under a national constitution nhich

calied for an annual rational Convention (NC) and cuarterly

National Council meetings wherein programs nere initiated

and debated.

Three national offigers vezo elected

annually

vith a National Interim Commitee to run the organization.

Regional offices and college chapters elected iciogates to

the national meetings but esch lunctioned independently on

local matters.

Its official pub-ication "Fire" (formerly

"Ney Left Notes") last appeared in December, 1969.

Internal lactionalism of eerious proportions

developed during 1963 - 1990 and the Zolloving three factions

REVOLUTIONARY YOUTH KOVEKENT

A source advised that the Revolutionary Youth

Hovement II (RYhiT) faction of Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) held a national conferonce at Atlanta, Georgia,

from November 26 to 30, 1969. At this conference it ras

decided. to form a new organization to be known as revolutionary

Youth lovemont (RYll), characterized as a nass anti imperialist

youth organization,

said organization being proposed as

separate and distinct in form and content from SDS. The

"Principles of Unity" adopted by the conference included a

struggle against white supremacy and male supremacy; lighes

against Imperialisi, anticommunism, fascisn

and oppression

of youth; and support of the right

of self-determination of

211

"opprossed nations," aiso. support of the right of

. 21l

"oppressed and exploited" peoples

sto arned scil-deiense."

It was agreed that Ryl would not be a Marxist-Leninist

organization; horever, source said this was decided in order

to indicate an organization broad enough in lorn to be

accepiable to everyone. A temporary National Steering

Conmittee (NSC) made up of eighi females and two males vas

elected to govern RYl until naiional officers could be

elected during the Spring of 1970.

both Atlanta, Georgia, and a second source has advised that

the NO has no office

space but rould probably be considered as

Second source advised that women dominated the

founding conference and have continued to dominate NSC

meetings to the point that "women's liberation" bas apparently

become the Ryl's principai issue - also that Rill's poor

Iinancial condition has resulted in its railure io publish

a papei.

During early 1970, nyk has decided to cater to

the working class rather than youth, since the potentlal for

From:

Marise Pols

February 18, 1971

The Citlzens Confarence on Ending the War in Indochina will as wo all hopc

nave an impact upon the thinking of the people in the towns and cities across

the United States from which the participants come. In that sense your will-

Ingness to accept spcaking engagoments and/or radio and telovision and news-

paper interviews will be very valuable.

The following subgestiong"might be helpful in this regard.

Sunday, February 21, At the same time the contact person in your area will

hear from members of the media between February 21 and your departure. It

is important that the madla will get the names of the sponsoring organiza-

tions, the dates of the flight, etc. You might also want to express your

expectations of the Conference as an individual. You may also be asked to

2)

It would be a good Idea if the group would choose its own spokesman

to handle modia contacts as well as a spokesman for a national press

conforence to be held, the day after arrival back in the States.

Flight #200.

They arrived in Luxemburg about 2:00 p.m. on

3/4/71 and boarded chartered buses to Paris, a trip of about

five hours.

The participants were lodged in

the Hotel

ALLEN BRICK, an associate executiveaf the FOR,

acted as the group's spokesman.

On friday, 3/5/11, the delegation met at the •

Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) Information

Bureau, 39 Avenue Georges Mandel.

ALLEN BRICK set out instructions on conduct and

cautioned them not to inflame or irritate friends from the

North of say anything that might force them into a bargaining

position.

that no individual discuss

these matters with members of the press. JOAN HULL, Exon

New York would serve the press representatives

and she

would furnish them

only sufficient information to relieve

their anxieties.

CANDY PUTTER of Philadelphia was critical of

Ambassador "DAVID BRUCE for seeing only a delegation of 12

and not the entire group.

She was instructed to contact the

U.S. Embassy for reconsideration.

XUAN THUY, Democratic Republic of Vietnam,

extended greetings.

He related details of Vietnam history,

their struggle with the French. The United States wanted

the French to continue with the war but they could not so

the Geneva Conference was signed in 1954. These agreements

recognized the independence, the

sovereignty, the unity,

and the territorial

integrity of Vietnam.

The Vietnamese want the war ended. As for POWs,

there can be no release until after the war.

The drV pro-

posed a deadline of 6/30/71.

ZUAN THUY stated he mentioned

this proposal to Ambassador BRUCE but he did not agree.

President NIXON claimed the invasion of Cambodia •

was just and now he says the same of Laos.

Americans will

be fighting wars for a long time.

The widening of the war

will only serve to hinder the withdrawal of troops. Since

both of these have failed, NIXON will perhaps plan to

invade North Vietnam. The Vietnamese want peace to

rebuild their country. Once peace isobtained, North Vietnam

will continue on its socialist path, while South Vietnam

will follow neutralisn,

The Vietnamese with the support of the Laotian

people and other socialist countries are determined to con-

tinue the fight until they have general independence and

freedom.

On Saturday, 3/6/71, Mme. BINH addressed the group

at the PRG Information Bureau

and stated she hoped the

delegation during a limited time would be able to view

their attitude and their position.

She wished to bring

about the clarification of relations between the Vietnamese

and the American people. Few nations in the world have

undergone such dreadful trials as the Vietnamese in order

to defend freedom and human dignity. Their greatest desire

is to live freely on their own soil. She claimed the NIXON

administration with its

superiority of weapons has sown

death, destruction, and hatred on their soil.

The American

GIs do not consider the Vietnamese as human beings and they

kill men, women, and children.

The speakers from the Laotian Student Union claim

the army in South. Vietnam is a puppet army of the United

States.

The United States should end the war in Vietnam

and let the Vietnamese solve their own problems.

The morale of the South Vietnam and U.S. Armies

is low. The Laotians want the Americans out of Laos.

These

speakers reviewed the history of Laos and related the plans

of invasion on Route 9 to cut the country in half and then

continue north.

The United States has dropped more than

3,000 tons of bombs on Laos everyday.

The American

imperialists have tried to shame the friendship and

solidarity between the Laotians, Cambodians, and the

Vietnamese.

The patriotic forces in Laos are winning more

and more

victories.

The Black Caucus of about eight members was

formed and planned to submit resolutions at the news

con-

ference on Monday.

on Sunday, 3/6/7L, THICK NHAI HANH, head of the

Buddhist delegation

in Paris, claimed that ald warring

parties want a

cease fire but they say it must be negotiated.

The Vietnamese people want an active end to the killing and

destruction. The Saigon Government opposes a cease fire

for they claim it would benefit the Viet Cong. The United

States talks about a cease fire but only for the sake of

propaganda.

HANH stated the U.S. Government can stop this war

and put an end to the killing. The American people can

exert pressuxe

but the pressure can only be effective if the

people

are united. He urged them to unite and form a strong

coalition.

If it were in his power he would withdraw the

troops now instead of waiting for a specified date.

The group was also addressed by Father NGUYEN.

DINH, Movement of Catholics and Service of the Nation in

South Vietnam; Mde. PHAN THI THIEN TU representing the

Committee of Opposition Forces in South Vietnam; and THICK

THIEN

CHAU, a Buddhist Monk.

On Sunday afternoon WILFRED BURCHETT, JACQUE

DE CORNOY, Professor JOHN CHESNEAUX, MiSs, MARY, MC. CARTHY

(U.S.), and PEGGY DUFF, International Confederation for

Peace and Disarmament, addressed the group..

In the evening Mr. CHAU SENG, Ambassador from the

United Front of Cambodia, addressed the group.

On Monday, 3/8/71, the delegation held a press

conference at which ALLEN BRICK reviewed the activities of

the delegation including

sessions with XUAN THUY, Mme.

well

as journalists, academicians, and experts on Indo-China

which included WILFRED BURCHETT, JACQUE DE CORNOY, SERGE

THION, Professor JOHN CHESNEAUX, MiSS MARY MC CARTHY (U.S.),.

and PEGGY DUFF, International Confederation for Peace and

Disarmament.

A panel of seven represented the delegation and

net with officials of the press. Although BRICK was the

spokesman, STAN, DALE, WAI

Radio, Chicago, Ill., was the

most outspoken

and he criticized the press for not telling

the truth to the American people.

The group was critical of DAVID BRUCE, U.S. Peace

Negotiator, for limiting the delegation to 12 whereas XUAN

THUY

and Mme. BINK addressed the entire group. Also, the

use of tape recorders was not permitted at meeting with

BRUCE although PRG and DRV permitted their use.

MES. ALLIDES CHRISTOPHER, Camden, N.J., stated the

Afro-Americans have

fought exploitation and oppression for

nore than 350 years.

Because of their historical back-

ground they initimately identify themselves with the

struggle for self-determination in which the Vietnamese

people are now fighting.

They fully understand the racist

nature of the war in Indo-China as well as

death and degrad-

ation imperialism brings.

As long as America wastes her

economic, technology, and human resources for the destruc-

tion abroad she cannot meet her demands at home.

As long

as the Indo-Chinese or any society in the human race is

subjected to American oppression, we will not be free.

Ambassador BRUCE met with delegation and Ambassador

PHAM DANG LAM of South Vietnam met with

group.

LAM asked

American help and assured them U.S. assistance is needed..

South Vietnam has exerted efforts to make certain U.S.

soldiers can return homebut this would be only if Hanoi

withdraws its troops from South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia

as troops of aggression.

The communists claim they want a

political settlement

which begins with the overthrow of the

elected government of South Vietnam.

A settlement by the

communists would not settle the problem as the people would

live under a forced rule. .

In his own view peace is nearer than most people

think. Films depicted progress in

• South Vietnam.

Those who met with Ambassador BRUCE reported back

to their respective groups on what transpired. BRUCE

reportedly stated a date of complete withdrawal could not

be set. It would

run the risk of not having a fruitful

negotiation.

The South Vietnam government is legal, it

exists. XUAN THUY is a propagandist and the Viet Cong have

no power. BRUCE would not admit Saigon is a puppet govern-

ment and

he did not believe the POW problem would be

settled if a withdrawal date were set.

BRUCE also reportedly stated that Mme. BINH has

no official status.

The delegates attempted to discuss

Vietnamese history with him but he refused.

The delgation

claims he is not aware of their history and does not care.

Mr. MILLER of the U.S. Embassy, Paris, France,

explained the negotiation picture of the

United States.

The

United States made proposals for a peaceful negotiation

and the North Vietnamese turned them down the very same day

and even objected to discussing them. North Vietnam wants

the United States out of Vietnam by June 30th.

The North Vietnamese refused to talk directly to

the Saigon Government.

The South Vietnamese refused to

negotiate with the PRG. The war continues in Indo-China .

solely because Hanoi desires it.

A question-and-answer session followed.

The participants boarded buses at 6:00 a.m.,

and departed Luxemburg

via Islandic Airlines; and arrived in New York about 7•30

p.m., Wednesday, 3/10/71.

Some participants planned to con-

tact their respective senators and congressmen in Washington,

D.C.

There are no definite plans for future action but

they were urged to bring pressure to bear on Federal law-

makers, state and local officials, and have them urge

Tom opened the meeting by suggesting that before the Committee meets again

Its members should be officially confirmed by the Philadelphia AFSC. Also, Tom said

Esthe Committee Itself should now assume the responsibility for appointing new members.

Stewart brought the Committee up to date on the "Jefferson Airplane" trip to

(Paris. The plane will bring about 35 Americans to Paris from March 3-10 to reet

and discuss with Vietnamese there the conditions for ending the war.

They will also

meet with U.s. officials there if the U.S, agrees. The pedple on the Airplane trip

will then be able to return to their communities to discuss what they have learned.

This will also be tied in to organizing around the People's Peace Treaty.

In relation to the Committee, Stewart noted that when the AFSC office was

moved from Houston to San Antonio, the idea was that programs should only be attemp-

ted in maybe 3 cities instad of trying to work in 8 or 9. Commitees would then be

set up in 3 citi:: ind there would be no Area Committee as such; there would, how

ever, be an adv: i group which would be made up of people from throughout the

Area and which woll:: meet once or twice a year.

the committe agrced with Stewart that this was a good general set-up and

that plans should be made to put it into practice. Stewart noted that the san

Antonio AFSC office was more of a "movement"-type office but that all ArSC programs

in the Area do not hai: to be these type of programs. Specifically, there are poss-

ibilities of working in Houston with with a more liberal BEM-type constituency. Tom

ight that he would be comfortable doing this but would have to spend more time in

Houston than he is presently doing. The rest of the staff felt that if Iom

were to

do this, they could handle the San Antonio AFSC office. It was noted that Mary Jensen

was voluntarilly handling all bills at the present time.

UNDER OLD BUSUNESS, It was noted that the statue of the coffee house proposal

submitted in request of funds to the AFSC Youth Affairs Division had for the moment

been turned down but that a new request would be submitted.

ALSO UNDER OLD BUSINESS, Hennacy House is running with some 15 permanent

people. 'All are contributing some $10-$15/month to keep the house above water

financially.

The situation in Bexar County Jail was discussed again with the Committee

approving Staff Work being done 'in this area, Stewart noted that often radival

action combined with support from the liberal establishirent-type community could

force changes to be made.

Efforts, he said, should probably be made on both fronts.

Ira Peine reported on the War Tax Resistance Rally that was held infustin

In December and also on the protest held in front of the telephone company the

first Tuesday in Februray. A War Tax Committee has been formed which will hold monthly

rallies at the phone company. People will publicly refuse to pay their telephone tax

turning the money over to a group working to help the community in some way. (Last

month's money went to the United Farmorkers.)

John Stanford suggested the idea of a local People's Coalition for Peace

and Justice in order that all groups working for various human rights can get the

maximum di support and cooperation. John will work out a plan for implementing

the coalition.

The Imerican

rIs in South

Vietnam do not consider Vietnanese

as hunans.

They are free to kill and disable anybody, whether

they be aged people or women or children.

The United

The United States has offered the release of ali prisoners

of war and

proposed the release of all prisoners of war on

both sides.

There was some discussion between Embassy

officials and members of the group over the question of

releasing prisoners of war prior to the cessation of

hostilities.

f.n

•Embassy official stated there has been a

great deal of evidence indicating that the treatment of

prisoners by the DRV has not been humane. The deegation

expressed its approval of this statement

and somebody men-

tioned "tiger cages".

The Embassy official remarked he did

not say prisons, he said prisoners.

One way to solve the

prisoner question would be to release them, all of them,

both sides regardless of whether or not a precedent would be

set.

In answer to one of the questions an Embassy official

stated that;

the united States is

in favor of an imnediate

cessation of bombini and

shooting on both sides.

This cease-

fire proposal has been placed on the table for discussion at

the Hotel kejestic, but the cease-fire should have inter-

national supervision throuphout Indochina.

That is their

position, but the other side refuses to discuss this cease-

fire proposal.

Several people in the group indicated that the

United States

should agree to a political settlement. They

stated the United

States should first particinate in

a cease-

fire movement and

then settle the political question American

imbassy officials indicated that this was not possible. The

Embassy official remarked that

they have been told many times

by many individuals during the various stares of nerotiations

nat if they would stop the bombin

the other side would

merotiate.

If they would lot the Mll take purt in the talks

then there would be serious nerotiatione.

They were told

that if they took ont substantial forces

there would be

serious nerotiations.

They have stopped the hombing in the

north, they have taken out substantial forces

and still they

continue to meet the same demands. The recorá does not

sustain that hope.

FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, HEBRUARY 21, 1971

One hundred and seventy Americans from I1 states will leave fraw New York's

Kennedy Airport on March 3 for a week-long conference with principals in the

Paris talks and others. Their objective is finding out what the requisites for

peace in Southtast Asia really are.

The Citizens Conference on Ending the War in Indochina, as the project is

called, is sponsored by the American Friends Service Comnittee (AISC), Clersy

and Laymen Concerned (CAIC) and the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR)..

"The conference will afford a large nunber of American citizens access to

and thoughtful discuscion with nany persons long familiar with the Indochina

struggle," explained Stewart Meacham, peace education secretary of the hISC.

"We hope that upon. their retum to the linited States, the participante will be

new and creative interpreters, in their respective communities, of what they

understand the requisites of peace to really be."

Participants expect to meet with representatives of the Provisional Revolu

tionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnan (PRG, formerly the National

Liberation Front), the

Democratic Republic of Vietnan (North Vietnam), the

Republic of Vietnam (Saigon) and the U.S. Delegation.

Meetings are also being arranged with representatives of the National

United Front of Cambodia,

the Laotian Student Union and various independent

South Vietnamese groups opposed to the war (including Buddhists, Catholics,

students and groupe supporting discident nembers of the Saigon Administration's

National Aasembly.)

Ar. Allan Brich

national progran director of

FOR, said that in addition

to meeting with official governent representatives, at the peace talks "we are

anzious to learn a groat deal more about the recent upsurge of civilion resist-

ance to the war in the large cities of South Vietnam. We want to reach a better

understanding of what the Victnamese people thenselves are stzugsling for."

The Rev. Richard Fernandez, direcior of CALC, indicated that "the conference

will come at an extrenely propitious nument given the United States second in-

vasion of a sovereign

country (Laos) in less than eleven munths. Mr. Melvin

Laird," the clergynan continued, "has told us that the invasion of Laos doesn't

represent a widening of the war--we are intorested to see what both Asians and

Europeans see in this new move."

The American Friends Service Comnittee was founded by a group of Quakers in

1917 to offer youns men an alternative to military service. Today, its 600

staff are engaged in peace education, relugee

celief, technical aid to devel-

oping countries, international conferences and community development work in

this country. Its headquarters are in Philadelphia.

Dear MI. Tolson:

Attached

is an invitation to a seminar that I hope you will find of special

interest. This event is next in a program of off-the-record unpublicized

discussions for government officials sponsored by the American Friends

Service Committee for the past twenty years.

The wide range of topics, covering both foreign and domestic affairs, has

drawn the participation of many Members of Congress and senior officials in

the Executive Branch. For your information I enclose a list of attenders

at a recent dinner seminar

on poverty in the U.s.

Your personal participation in the discussion of the crisis in criminal

justice and related flelds would be most welcome. I hope your schedule will

permit your acceptance.

If, however, you cannot join us, I would appreciate

the suggestion for a substitute from among your colleagues.

We look forward

to a call from your office as soon as possible.

Seein, Corazally yours,

America. It was prepared by a "working party" composed of both scholars in criminal jus-

tice, and persons who have been on the receiving end of the system. The preface states

question of crime, justice, and punishment has become a major public issue once again

The working party concludes that reformist prescriptions for improving the system of cri:

minal justice are bankrupt and that the system is a major failure. The seminar is to

examine with the three working party members listed

as consultants, the findings and reco-

mmendations of the book. We shall focus on the policy implications for the legislative

and executive branches.

Your response to the book's "Epilogue: Action" will be especially

valuable.

social work in the Philadelphia prisons. He is a member of the

Governor's Justice Commission.

Statement from Bronson P. Clark, Executive Secretary •

..

Two representatives of the American Friends Service Committee have just

returned from Hanoi where they delivered a humanitarian shipment of heart

surgery equipment. They are Dr. George Perera, former associate dean

of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a re-

cognized expert on hypertensinn, and John A. Sullivan, Associate Executive

Secretary of AFSC.

Our representatives brouglit home personal and photographic evidence of what

some of the American bombs are now doing: wrecked hospitals, schools, homes

and cultural buildings. They stood on and photographed a primary and a second-

ary dike at Nam Dinh which had been bombed with no visible military target

nearby. Whether the bombing of civilian institutions, the maiming and killing

of civilians and the damage and weakening of dikes is intentional or accidental is

academic. The critical question is whether these things are happening, and the

direct, first-hand evidence of AFSC observers is that they are.

U.S. bombardment and naval shelling of North Vietnam must be terminated. For

a technologically superior country like ours to be raining sophisticated destruction

on a rclativoly defenseless, essentially peasant people who are completely with-

out the means of the slightest attack on our country brings dishonor to American

ideals. Our representatives found in all their couversations and observations that

the North Vietnamese people, far from being driven to defeat, are uniting more

strongly under the pressure and putting their ability to adapt and survive to work

to outlast and endure the bombing.

In the name of all that is holy, in the name of spiritual values, in the very name

of America, this loathsome bombing and shelling must stop.

IANOI, July 20, 1972

Hostile planes knife through cold and silent sky.

Hearse loudspeakers signal the approach.

The sirens that I heard in London —

Another land, another time, another pang of history —

I hear again.

Theirs is the raucous call known well to ears that have heard war before.

Who goes there overhead? Is he

From the plains of Kansas, green slopes of Vermont,

The soft-voiced south, the uproar of New York,

The ever-greening Northwest U.S.A.?

Who up there knows what I see here?

Look: There goes the enemy:

A sweet-eyed child chubby-legged on a bike.

A mother caring anxiously for her young.

A slender girl bent over green shoots in a paddy,

A rider off his bicycle and sitting by a hole —

The single-occupancy shelter designed to beat the bomb.

Men, women, children... the enemy is everywhere?

And the targets abound.

The factories, ports, rails, homes, hospitals, dikes

That hold the salted sea from land,

Or coursing rivers that bring green life.

Or death.

Who sits underground?

I sit in concrete shelter rooms

and talk of war.

With a Vietnamese surgeon whom war has forced

To new techniques of saving lives.

An Indian of supreme dignity who

Presides over the international group

named to control the agreement of men who

Decided 18 years ago to supervise a peace that hasn't come.

An actress who knows the studios of

Paris, London, Hollywood,

Now to find, falling asleep at night,

That her pillow is wet from tears

in a on a route of mon

Brought forth by sights of war and thoughts of men

Her country has sent to ride the skies on tubes of death.

Oh, Vietnam, Vietnam.

I know your gentle, slow and graceful people in the south,

And now I see here, in Hanoi, the same soft sweetness,

The same deep love of life and land.

The same people, the same clothes, the same words,

As those I know beyond the Ben Hai.

Uh, Vietnam.

In the enveloping heat of July, another flush comes to my face.

How can it be? When will it stop? Who will say the word?

For the information of the Bureau and receiving

offices, referenced Philadelphia letter to San Antonio

dated 4/23/73, requested specific Bureau authority prior to

covering the lead as stated in San Antonio letter to

Washington Fleld dated 4/2/73. This request for specific

authorization from the Bureau

was made inasmuch as the

American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is a function

of the religious Society of Friends and is not under

investigation at Philadelphia, which covers the AFSC Headguarters,

and is not believed to be an appropriate subject for FBI

investigation.

For the information of the Bureau and receiving

offices, San Antonio, being aware of the religious nature

of the AFSC, does not conduct active investigation of the

organization.

However, the San Antonio Office of AFSC is

frequented by present and past subjects of known subversive

character; i.e., THOMAS FLOWER, San Antonio file 100-10305,

who is presently in Leavenworth Penitentiary for his anti-war

activities; THOMAS WETZLER, San Antonio file 100-12944, past

leader and organizer of the San Antonio Vietnam Veterans

Against the War (VAW); and RITA NEUREUTHER, San Antonio

file 100-13682, who appears at the majority of San Antonio

demonstrations. All of these persons mentioned as well as

others have had access

to the telephone located at the AFSÇ

Office in the past or have access to it now.

Tolls were obtained regarding the San Antonio

AFSC Office telephone for the purpose of complying with the

spirit of the Computerized Telephone Number File Program

and its potential in identification of the New Left

communication

was

network nationwide. The further purpose

to determine if the telephone was actually being used

by persons in which the Bureau had an interest, or was

merely available to them.

The lead as set forth in referenced

San Antonio letter would accomplish this end.

By utilizing good judgement in covering the lead

set forth in referenced San Antonio letter it is felt

this objective can be accomplished without embarrassment

to the Bureau. As will be noted the lead required only an

indices check and the forwarding of pertinent information

to San Antonio.

Bureau authority is reguested for each of the

receiving offices to accomplish the lead as set forth in

referenced San Antonio letter.

The American Friends Service Committee is not

Philadelphia files reflect the Arsc is a com-

active in the fields of peace, community relations,

and service to victims of war and injustice.

The AFSC

PURPOSE:

To advise Director relative to letter of Ms. Nike

1 Navor dated 7/22/73, which alleges surveillance by the BI"of

members of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) and

obtain approval for attached acknowledgement.

BACKGROUND :

Navor mentions watching a special telecast on

"surveillance" which program shows Philadelphiaas representing

a typical American city.

The AFSC is located in Philadelphia.

Navor alleges that AFSC

had been under surveillance and expressed

shock that such surveillance was so prevalent and felt that this

is injurious to the freedom of Americans.

She urged the Director

to give the matter serious consideration.

As a result of the break in of the Media, Pennsylvania,

Resident Agency 3/8-9/71, an investigation was launched

to

determine the perpetrators of the burglary and who was

distributing the stolen documents to the press.

Many

individuals, some of whom were members of

the ArsC, were

contacted for interview during the course of this investigation.

ASC, a Quaker Fleas organization, has been active

in drait resistance

the antiwar movement, and has made substantial

financial contributions

to major antivar groups and demonstrations.

They have held many antivar demonstrations in Washington and

throughout the U.s.

No active investigation has been conducted

by the FBI on the AFSC.

The activities regarding demonstrations

have been followed and

pertinent data disseminated to other

government agencies in the intelligence community

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re :

American Friends Service Committee

100-11392

The recent TV Program to which Navor refers is an

This program focuses on the City of Philadelphia and studies

the various forms of surveillance by law enforcement, government

and private agencies, such as wire taps, stake outs, photographing

and tape recording suspect persons, monitoring the mails and

investigations by credit companies. The FBI cases mentioned in

this program were a rehash of cases brought to public light as

a result of the surfacing of stolen FBI documents from the

Media Resident Agency burglary.

The AFSC are plaintiffs in a civil action filed in

July, 1971, in the United States District Court, Philadelphia,

in which the Attorney General, the former Director and others

are named as defendants.

In addition to the AFSC, the Philadelphia

Resistance and eighteen individuals are plaintiffs. The complaint

alleges that the defendants through harassment, intimidation and

surveillance have unlawfully intruded on plaintiffs' right to

privacy and free speech. The matter is pending and the pretrial

proceedings have not yet been completed. There were no illegal

surveillances of any kind concerning AFSC.

Bufiles contain no information regarding Nike Navor.

RECOMMENDATION:

That attached acknowledgement letter be sent to

Nike Navor.

blessed and often torn country.

METAI

Yours is one of the most difficult jobs in this

country. My silent and spoken prayers are with you.

At this point

as a concerned citizen, I would like to mention something which is

troubleing me.

several nights ago I watched a special telacast on "survailance."

I'm sure that you are aware of the program and may even have watched yourself.

As you may know, the telacast chose Philadelphia as its model; representing a

typical American city. The American Friends Service Committee is located in

Philadelphia.

about govenmental activity that so many young people have, I wasnot surprised that the

AFSC had been under survailance. I am also not surprised, due to the many radical conceri

of Friends toady, to learn that many Friends are now personally under survailence.

I would like to point out however that Friends as a group are not interested inthe

loverthrow of any government.

In my three years of association with Friends, I have

never heard this type of feeling voiced. Perhaps I should point out as a point of

information as well as a personal concern that it has been often felt "that the

business of being a Quaker is to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable."

However as a non-violent religious group, we use our intelects and our souls jointly in

this endevor.

REC- 70.

L.11/3-170

feel this is injurious to our freedom as Americans. And I urge you to give the matter

your serious consideration.

Our system of government provides that one is innocent until proven guilAyG l@ut973

constitution provides for personal freedmon of speech, press, and freedom of assembly.

Our nation was founded on the ideals of moral and polítical desent. -perhaps desent Is ou

• insurance policy for safeguarding freedom. We are indeed lucky to have such a system

of government. Many people of the earth have no such freedoms as their right.

Realizing fully that there is often a fine line between safeguarding the freedoms of

the public and providing "security" as well, I imagine that law enforcement agencies

must often feel that they are walking a tight-rope of sorts.

On the belief that the American public too often demands of their elected and appointed

officals much more than they would ever demand of themselves, I am in this letter

committing myself to the above written moral and social beliefs. I realize fully

that this letter may have the opposite affect of which it was intended.

That if there

is not already a file on me (I doubt that there is), this letter may start one.

However, in good faith I submit this letter to your consideration.

Dear Sir:

I am presently engaged in research on the history or multi-

national investment patterns in connection with the New England

Action/ Research (NEAR) project of the American Friends service

Committee here in Cambridge. Recently I helped teach a seminar

series for AFSC on multinationals and economic conversion in my

capacity as a member of the local policy Advisory Committee of

let tilled went!? (

poll 11!?:

On a recent visit to Washington to the National Archives

ia Justice Department document from 1942 or 1944, came to my attention

would prove most useful to my ongoing research and teaching

activities.

The document pertains to loverseas investments by

IS firms in Germany, Italy and Japan'immediately prior to the

Second World War. I I believe that the document was an internal

memorandum prepared by the FBI. Unfortunately, there seems to

be no copy of this document at

the Archives.

I would very much appreciate your assistance in obtaining a

copy of this document.

I will gladly reimburse you for copying

and mailing costs.

It is my understanding that, although origi-

nally a confidential wartime document, this document should be

public information covered under Executive Order #11652 (Pentagon

Papers Order) and by the recently inaugurated policy of former

Secretary Richardson to declassify historical documents from this

perioa.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sirs:

Over the past several weeks three widely different organizations

have become involved in controvepsy in this isolated little community.

They are the Nature Conservancy,

and the John Birch Society.

So eye i the 1 and

American Friends Service Committee,

All three are under highly emotional

attack from various

elements in the community.. People are taking

sides and firm opinions are being established. Yet facts are scarce

In a

small, rural setting, such an issue pits friend against

friend, neighbor against neighbor, and tears at the very fabric of

the

community.

What guidance can you offer, and what information can you provid€

co help us to an understanding of the true nature and purpose or these

organizations?

Sincerely,

Donald C. Whitmill
