MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : HSCA Hearings and Questions

1. I asked HSCA whether it was intended that any

CIA (current or ex) employees other than those mentioned

by Blakey yesterday evening would be called to testify.

Those mentioned were Messrs. Helms, Hart and the DCI.

The answer is that more are

expected to be called, but

the names were not yet available. Gary Cornwell is to

be back to me in the near future on this. I pointed

ut that the Agency's waiver to employees on speaking

to the Committee did not extend to public testimony or

classified matters and it was important that this be

addressed

soon.

2.

I had also asked if we should continue preparing

written answers to earlier questions concerning Nosenko,

given the anticipated interrogatories from the Committee

next week. He said no.

He added that if someone is

"reading"

in preparation for those answers they should

continue, but

the new questions would be more specific.

I have so advised Len McCoy and Mike

"Sednaoui? (Mike] was

doing the written answers to the previous questionnaire).
