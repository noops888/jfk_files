MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : HSCA Hearings and Questions

1. I asked HSCA whether it was intended that any
CIA (current or ex) employees other than those mentioned
by Blakey yesterday evening would be called to testify.
Those mentioned were Messrs. Helms, Hart and the DCI.
The answer is that more are expected to be called, but
the names were not yet available. Gary Cornwell is to
be back to me in the near future on this. I pointed
out that the Agency's waiver to employees on speaking
to the Committee did not extend to public testimony on
classified matters and it was important that this be
addressed soon.

2. I had also asked if we should continue preparing
written answers to earlier questions concerning Nosenko,
given the anticipated interrogatories from the Committee
next week. He said no. He added that if someone is
"reading" in preparation for those answers they should
continue, but the new questions ould be more specific.

I have so advised Len McCoy and {Mik√© *Sednaoui (tee}was
doing the written answers to the previous questiornaire).
