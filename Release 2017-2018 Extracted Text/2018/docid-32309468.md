On May 17, 1961, Sergeant Sapp advised that

Redmond and Roma had again been arrested for vagrancy

st Bayfront Park, along with Alfred bushane and Albert

Mariner, who were also charged with vagrancy.

Sergeant Sapp advised that these members

of Interpen have developed into a police problem, are

rowdy and drunken, and cause considerable comment by

residents of Miami and tourists visiting the city.

M T-1, on June 5, 1961, advised that Tom

Cain and

matter concerning his pending deportation hearing, to

be held in the United States District Court in Miami.

Prato said that Perez Jimenez wondered how it was

possible for American adventurers, such as the Interpen

members,

to maintain a training camp, wear uniforms

and practice military maneuvers in the United States,

after they have publicly stated they plan to violate

United States neutrality laws by proposed military

attacks against Cuba.

Perez Jimenez expressed some

apprehension in cooperating with them, for fear they

would be arrested by United States authorities. Willis

and Watley planned to make an appointment to see Perez

Jimenez at a later time concerning offering their

services and those of Interpen to Perez Jimenez.

Om June 5, 1961, MM T-1 advised that (first

name unknown Peleaz, 5733 Northwest th Place...

representing Perez Jimenez, bought one hundred sixty

dollars worth of food for a donation to Interpen.

This food consisted mainly of rice, beans, and canned

items.

On June 28, 1961, MM Tol advised that

representatives of Perez Jimenez were supposed to

visit a cam site established at Key Largo, Florida

by Interpen.

At the camp site, they would be given

demonstrations in military training and jungle

these organizations have refused to

with

Interpen. A)u)

During May and June, 1961, the following

individuals advised that their organizations would

have nothing to do with Interpen:

Orlando Carcia, Assistant to Aurellano Sanchez

of Cuba:

Failure of Plans

MM Tol explained that many of the irresponsible

plans of lewing have failed. One involved driving a

car fron Miani, Florida, to Guatemala;

for some unknown

revolutionary

purpose.

Hemming also was involved in

another plan with Agustin Capo,

a Cuban national,

go on a reconnaissance trip by boat to the Cay Sal Bank

of islands, north

of Cuba, and later

establish

a base

for Interpen there

for future commando raids against

Cuba. This failed, inasmuch as Capo is being watched

by the United States Border Patrol, and is afraid if

he leaves on his boat, he will be arrested @m)

Re: Intercontinental Penetration Forces

Hemming had another plan to obtain a 106 foot

salvage boat to take his group on a commando raid against

Cuba.

however, he was able to obtain access to this

boat.

MM Tol explained that Herming has a new and different

plan

daily, does not follow through on any of

them, and

none of them ever succeed. *

Press Publicity

The "Miani Herald," a dally newspaper published

in Miami, Florida, on June 27, 1961, contained an article

concerning Interpen, stating that most members are Americans,

although the leaders claim the group Includes Canadians,

Venezuelans, Cubans and other anti-Communists.

article stated that the existence of this group was known

by the Herald, but it became generally know to the

public on June 26, 1961, after Florida Senator George

A. Swathers disclosed that Cuban exiles are training in

Florida. The article said that Senator Smathers! dis-

closure on a nation wide radio network brought other

newsmen

and television cameramen to Interpen headquarters

on June 26, 1961.

article described Henning as a "young

giant, 6 feet Y inches tall, with long way hair, a

trimed beard, an Australian bush hat,

who looks

like Errol Flynn in his earlier matinee days."

The

article stated that Hemming said the recruits are

first housed at the headquarters, and then sent to

a training site in the Everglades, accessible only

by boat.

The article continued, stating that Interpen

holds parachute rigging classes in the middle of a

street in Miami, and one elderly Miami couple stated

Re:

they told the police, but the police said there was

nothing they could do about it. The article said

that the climax of Interpen training is parachute

jumping at an abandoned South Florida airfield.

The article continued that Herming hires

a sky diving instructor and rents a light plane for

the exercises, and during the jumping drills on the

previous Saturday, the Sheriff's patrol officers

looked on and made no attempt to interfere. The

article went on that Interpen has about one hundred

members, Including some at bases in Califoria and

in the North, and its purpose was to fight Commnism,

look for adventure, or "because they just like soldier

ing."

Joe Gorman,

as saying:

"I would rather be

a member from Kentucky, was quoted

to death.

Fi T-1, on June 27, 1961,7 vised that

the above mentioned article was out of proportion

to the true situation, and served no other purpose

than to obtain publicity for Hemming and attract

more adventurers to the Miami area.

MM Tol explained that on June 21, 1961,

a plane was rented at Howe Aviation, Tamiami Airport,

Miami, and flown to an abandoned field at Davies.

Florida, where the plane was met by Hemming, Joe

Goran, Larry Worley, Frank Little and one other

Individual, nane unk

Also there were Frank fiorini, a notorious would-be

soldier of fortune, a fourteen year old Cuban boy,

Joe forman and Larry Worley got in the airplane,

and each made a parachute ju

When these, two only

avallable parachutes were repacked, Frank little and

Hemming boarded the airplane and made a parachute jum.

The photographer took photographs,

which appeared in a

later issue of the

"Miami Herald."

MM T-I said that these were

the first and

only parachute jumps made by Interpen members.

They

were practice jumps, and fortunately, nobody was injured,

Inasnch as none of these individuals has had any train-

Ing or experience, and they are not in adequate physical

condition.

On June 28, 1961, the "Miami Herald" contained

an article stating that Interpen's Commander is the

"biggest, strongest and most handsome member of the

lot, and

in his marine camouflage suit, Australian

bush hat, wavy hair and beard, he has the look of

an old -time French msketeer."

article continues

by stating that Herming is convinced that the pro-

Cormunist Government of Cuba will be overthrow only

by infiltration of guerrilla fighters;

that he and

his men live in a rooming house, and when they are

not on training exercises in the Everglades Swamps,

or parachuting

at an abandoned airfield, they practice

rigging parachutes in the street.

The article con-

tinues that neighbors have complained, but the police

contend there is nothing they can do.

Herming claims

he does not try to hide the fact that Interpen i8

part of

the International Anti-Communist Brigade, which

is associated with the Revolutionary Junta of National

Liberation, led by Aureliano Sanchez Arango.

Re: Intercontinental Penetration Forces

MM T-I; on June 27, 1961, advised that on

that day, Hemming and three of his men went to Key

Largo, Florida,

later returned, and brought

others with then to establish a survival training

camp somehere in key Largo in the Florida Keys. (Au)

MM T-l explained that Herming met some-

one who knew an individual uning property in Rey

Largo, and allowed them to use this property. MM T-l

explained that on June 28, 1961, representatives of

Marcos Perez Jimenez are

going to visit the camp

site at Key Larg®, and observe Hewing and his

eight

companions in their training maneuvers. MM T-1

said that Hemming vill tell the Venezuelans

that

this

Is just one of the many combat squads of Interpen,

and that many other squads are standing by at other

places.

Herming hopes to fool the Venezuelans into

giving him large donations of ams, equipment and

food.

On June 27, 1961, the United States Border

Patrol, Miami, advised that Inspector Harry Rhodes,

of the United

States Border Patrol at Homestead,

Florida, received a call from fishermen off Julia

Island In the Florida Keys that some shooting was

going on. Upon arrival, Inspector rhodes discovered

that Herming and his group were conducting a jungle

survey training class, and Hemming had in his possess

ion only one ?? caliber rifle, a small amount of

amnition and some equipment.

The rifle shot

apparently ricocheted and barely missed hitting

nearby fisherman.
