Prato said that Perez Jimenez wondered how it was
possible fer American adventurers, such as the Interpen
members, tc maintain a training camp, wear uniforms
and practice military maneuvers in the United States,
after they have publicly stated they plan to violate
United States neutrality laws by proposed military
attacks against Cuba. Perez Jimenez expressed some
apprehension in cooperating with them, for fear they
would be arrested by United States authorities. Willis

Jimenez at a later time concerning offering their
services and these of Interpen to Perez Jimenez. a Mm)

Failure ef Plans

MM T-1 explained that many of the irresponsible

plans of Hemming have failed, fone involved driving a
car from Miami, Florida, to Guatemala, for some unknown
revolutionary purpose. Heoming also was involved in
another plan with Agustin Capo, a Cuban national, to
go on a reconnaissance trip by beat to ‘the Cay Sal Bank
of islands, north of Cuba, and later establish a base
for Interpen there for future commands raids against ’
Cuba. This failed, inasmuch as Capo is being watched
by the United States Border Patrol, and is afraid if
he leaves on his boat, he will be arrested HY)

Re: Intercontinental Penetration Forces |

Hemming had another plan to obtain a 106 foot

“salvage beat to take his group on a commando raid against

Cuba. lewever, he was unable to obtain access to this

beat... Tl explained that Hemming has a new and different ,

plan ly, does not follow through on any of them, and \
none of them ever succeed. )

Press Publicity

| ‘The "Miami Herald," a daily newspaper published
in Miami, Flerida, on June 27, 1961, contained an article

~ concerning Interpen, stating that most members are’ Americans,

although the leaders claim the group includes Canadians,
Venezuelans, Cubans and other anti-Communists. ‘The
article stated that the existence of this group was known :
by the Herald, but it became generally known.to the

public on June 26, 1961, after Florida Senator George

As Smathers disclosed that Cuban exiles are training in
Florida, The article said that Senator Smathers’ dis-
closure on a nation-wide radio network brought other =.
newsmen and television cameramen to Interpen headquarters
on Jume 26, 1961, : :

The article described Hemming as a "young
giant, 6 feet 7 inches tall, with long wavy hair, a
trimmed beard, an Australian bush hat, who lecks
like Errel Flynn in his earlier matinee days." The
article stated that Hemming said the recruits are
first housed at the headquarters, and then sent to
a training site in the Everglades, accessible only
by boat. The article continued, stating that Interpen
holds parachute rigging classes in the middle of a

- Street in Miami, and one elderly Miami couple stated

they told the police, but the police said there was lO :
nothing they could do about it. The article said ae G

that the climax of Interpen training is parachute
H jumping at an abandoned South Florida airfield.

The article continued that Hemming hires
a sky diving instructor and rents a light plane for
the exercises, and during the jumping drills on the
previous Saturday, the Sheriff's patrol officers
leeked on and made no attempt to interfere. The
article went.on that_Interpen has about one hundred
members, including some at bases in California and
1 in the North, and its purpose was to fight Communism,

‘fim-7-1, on Jue 27, 1961,fadvised that
the above-mentioned article was out of proportion
to the true situation, and served no other purpose
than to obtain publicity for Hemming and attract
more adventurers to the Miami area.

MM ToL explained that on June 27, 1961,
a plane was rented at. Howe Aviation, Tamiami Airport,
Miami, and flewn to an abandoned field at Davie, ~
Florida, where the.plane was met by Hemming, Joe.

Re: Intercontinental Penetration Forces

Joe Gorman and Larry Werley got in the airplane, |
and each made a parachute jump. When these, two only -

available parachutes were repacked, Frank Little and
Hemming bearded the airplane and made a parachute Jump.
The photographer took photographs, which appeared in a
; later igsue of the "Miami Herald." (a)

i MM Tol said that these were the first and
only parachute jumps made by Interpen members. They i
were practice jumps, and fortunately, nobody was injured, at
tmasmuch as none of these individuals has had any train- |
ing or experience, and they are not in adequate physical
condition. :

On Jume 28, 1961, the "Miami Herald" contained
an article stating that Interpen’s Commander is the
"biggest, strodgest and most handsome member of the
lot, and in his qarine camouflage suit, Australian ‘
bush hat, wavy hair and beard, he has the look of ‘ /°
an old-time French musketeer." The article continues
by stating that Hemming is convinced that the pro= ~
Communist Government of Cuba will be overthrown only
by infiltration of guerrilla fighters; that he and ys
his men live in a rooming house, and when they are
not on training exercises in the Everglades Swamps ,
| or parachuting ‘at an abandoned airfield, they practice
: rigging parachutes in the street. the article con-
tinues that neighbors have complained, but the police
contend there is nothing they can do.’ Hemming claims
he does net try to hide the fact that Interpen is
part of the International Anti-Commmist’ Brigade, which
is associated with the Revolutionary Junta of National a
Liberation, led by Aureliano Sanchez Arango.
