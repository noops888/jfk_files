MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Plans
SUBJECT “ +: Request for Renewal of the LIENVOY Project

The LIENVOY Project is submitted for renewal for the period
1 February 1964 through 31 January 1965, for a total of $47,063;
$20,530 for FY 1964 and $26,538 for FY 1965, No additional funds
are required for FY 1964; however, as the equipment approved in an
amendment submitted in June 1963 for $23,000 will not be ordered
during the remainder of the present Fiscal Year.

1. Objectives: The LIENVOY Project provides for a joint CIA/
Mexican Government sponsored telephone tap unit, and for a non-
provides access to the

2. Agents: There have been no changes in agent personnel
during the past year, and none are proposed during the coming year.
Arnold F, AREHART, Staff Agent, continues to do an outstanding job
in managing the top center and in keeping all technical cquipment
in repair.

3. Changes: During the past year, Headquarters approved the
Station's plan to move the LIENVOY intercept center for security
reasons, and to replace the older equipment with new and more mobile
equipment. This move has been held in abeyance until this opera-
tion can be discussed with LITENSOR's successor and a mutuai
decision is made about the future operational’ pattern of the tap
phase of LIENVOY, LITENSOR's successor will not officially replace
him until December 1964, Meantime, the security of the intercept
premises has been tightened and it is believed that LITENSOR or
LIELEGANT could handle any problems which might arise.

4. Intelligence Production: LIENVOY is one of the most
productive telephone tap projects in KUBARK of both FI and CE
type information. From 1 February 1963 through 15 January 1964,
this project has been the source of 309 positive. reports, 56 of
which were not disseminated. LIENVOY-2 was the source of 16
reports, and the tap intercept program accounted for the remain-
ing 293. No customer evaluations were requested, but WH/3
evaluates the product as being valuable and covering a wide range
of topics difficult to cover through other sources. Tho types of
reports originating from this Project include such matters as:

LIENVOY-2: Communist and leftist activity in Mexico
Communist publications
International congresses
Mexican political activities

LIENVOY; Communist and leftist personalities an
activities in Mexico
Travel
Soviet and Satellite Activities in Mexico
Cuban activities in Mexico and developments
in Cuba :
International conferences and delegates
Communist Chinese activities in Mexico

5. Effectiveness: In addition to the positive intelligence
production this’ Project is the source of valuable CE information
and operational leads. The intercept center covers 30 lines, all
of which are of interest to KUBARK and approximately one-half of
them are exclusively for KUBARK. These 30 lines include Mexican
Communist and leftist leaders, Prensa Latina, the Local Security
Service (Direccion Federal de Seguridad-DFS), 5 lines on the Soviet
Embassy, 3 on the Cuban Embassy, 2 on the Czech: Embassy, and since
September 1963 there have been 3 on the Yugoslav Embassy. This
center records an average of 525 recis per month, from which the
tap center monitors prepare daily summaries of significant items
gleaned frén all the lines. These daily resumes total between 100
to 150 pages per month, The tap center monttors prepare full
transcripts in Spanish for the Cuban, Yugoslav, and Soviet Embassy
lines. The reels for the Soviet and Satellite coverage are given

the Station for passage to Station asset» who translate the
Soviet, Czech and Yugoslav portions.

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, Yugoslav and Soviet Embassies
provide details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and
other useful CE data. Information gained from this source has
led to a successful recruitment in. the Yugoslav Embassy during

the past year. :

Examples of some important non-disseminable information
obtained through LIENVOY during the past year are:

a. During May, through LIENVOY, the Station uncovered
a harrassment operation directed against thu U.S. Embassy by the
use of forged routine forms to embarrass the Embassy and known

anti~Communists,

b, Several contacts made by U.S. citizens with the
Cuban and Soviet Embassies, and with Mexican Communists wero
recorded, This information ig given special dissemination to the
FBI for their action, The most significant of these contacts was
that by Lee OSWALD with the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico
prior to the assassination of the late President KENNEDY. OSWALD's
contact was cabled to Headquarters on 8 October 1963 and this |
information was immediately disseminated to the appropriate ODYOKE |

offices,
¢. During August LIENVOY contributed support to the
REDWOOD AZJUMBO operation by providing information on contacts
between principals involved in this sensitive SR operation.
6. Problems; There have been no significant security, cover,
control, OF Iialson problems during the past year.

7. Ltatson: This Project encompasses an unofficial liaison
relationship with high-level offictals which

late President Kennedy, the Chief of Station alerted" Mexican
officials to selected LIENVOY coverage of the Cuban Embassy which

~oncerned Lee OSWALD. As a result they took immediate action

favorable to PBPRIME by making appropriate arrests, conducting
interrogations, rejecting a Cuban Embassy protest note, and
killing a Soviet’ propaganda effort to place the blame on minority
groups in PBPRIME.

In December 1963, a.KUBARK official traveled to Mexico with a
visual presentation concerning the Cuban arms cache in Venezucla.
There he gave a special briefing to LITENSOR, pointing out the
authenticity of the Cuban origin of these arms, and thus contri-
buting significantly to a reaction by the Mexican Government on
this important inter=American matter favorable to ODYOKE.

In connection with a to several East
and West European countries in March and April 1963, the Station
was provided several briefing papers on these countries, prepared

9. Plans: No significant operational changes are planned
during the coming Project year. In December 1964 LITENSOR will
probably be replaced by LITEMPO-2. This should cause no major
adjustments since the Station is already on good terms with
LITEMPO-2 under the LITEMPO Project. It is anticipated that
LITEMPO-2 will continué the intercept program without change.

FY 1965. No additional funds are required for FY 1964 since
sufficient funds remain from the past approval to cover the
$20,530 required under this renewal request.

REQUEST FOR PROJRCT LIENVOY RENEWAL

A. Gurrent Objectives.

The objectives of this project remain the same as those stated in the
last reneval_request. The project the Mexico Station vith
tage rapid to The only oajor change
vhich will occur “in the next project year is al_______] It is too early
to determine hov this change will affect the operation of LIENVOY. The COs
Mexico has been asgured that LIENVOY will remain in operation but LITENSOR vants
it to continue as is for an as yet undeteruined length of time, All major
objectives of the project are being effectively realized.

3B. Changes.

In the last project renewal request, it vas planned to wove the intercept
center for security reascns, This move has been held in abeyance pending sows
indication from LITENSCR on how his successor vill feel about the future of
LIENVOY and the manner he wishes it to operate, The security of the premises has
deen tightened and it is believed that LITENSOR can handle any problems which
might arise.

Cc. Intelligence Production.

Esch month an operational report is forvarded to Headquarters listing the
Atepatches, cables, and intelligence reports based on LIENVOY production.

In Septeaber 1963 Paul V. J.EVISTER (ps), Headquarters EUTUBE officer, came
to Mexico on teaporary duty to review the LIENVOY and LIFEAT projects as examples
of technical operations producing a high rate of positive intelligence, It ie
suggested that the study prepared by this officer be reviewed in connection with
this request for reneval.

D, Effectivencas.
The onc] EanuEEEEEE Ea p provide the same! to the
highest level. Which 18 more effective with each year of

operation, The daily “resumen” from the de urrent
intelligence as well as background date on The
Cuban section at the station would be seriously handicapped without the daily

transcripts on the Cuban Embassy lines, The same is true for the Soviet and
Soviet Sattellite coverage. Background information from LIENVOY on these
officials has lead to successful recruitwents in the Cuban and the Yugoslav
Embassies.

‘This project contributes to the friendly attitude of the Nexican Govern-
ment officials. Regarding the assaseination of President Kennedy, Willard C.
Curtis alerted Mexican officials on 23 November to selected LIENVOY coverage
of the Cuban Eabassy. As a result they took immediate action favorable to
PBPRIME, they made arrests, conducted interrogations, rejected the Cuban
Babassy protest note and killed the Scviet propaganda effort to place the dlema
on minority groups in PBPRIME. With wide press play, Nexican Foreign Ninister,
Manuel Tello, publicly ordéred the Mexican Ambassador in Cuba to return the -
protest note as unacceptable and not in keoping with diplonatic protocol.
