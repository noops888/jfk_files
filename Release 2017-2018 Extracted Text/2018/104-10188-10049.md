Information gained from this source has

the past year.

Exanples of some important non-disseminable information

obtained through LIENVOY during the past year are:

During May, through LIENVOY, the Station uncovered

use of forged routine forms to embarrss the Embassy and known

anti-Comnunists,

This Information is given special dissemination

to the

FBI for their action.

The most significant of these contacts was

that by Lee OSWALD with the Cuban and Sovlet Embassies

in Mexico

prior to the assassination of the late President KaNEDY.

OSWALD's

contact was cabled to Headquarters on 8 October 1963 and

information was immediately disseminated to the appropriate ODYOKE

offices.

During August LIENVOY contributed support to the

REDWOOD ARJUMBO upcration by providing information on contacts
