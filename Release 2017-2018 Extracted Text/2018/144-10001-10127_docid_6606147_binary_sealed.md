TOT SECRE

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY

OF DEFENSE (INTELLIGENCE)

SUBJECT:

Senate Select Committee Queries to NSA Concerning

the Warren Commission

Reference your letter dated 14 January 1976 transmitting

a request from Mr. Alton Quanbeck of the Senate Select

Committee Staff.

The following information is provided in

response to Mr. Quanbeck's letter, keyed by paragraph to

his

letter (inclosed - see underlined portions).

Most of

the information was made available

to the SSC Staff, Mr.

Jim Johnson, during an interview with Dr. Louis Tordella

on 20 January 1976.

Para. 1. - NSA requested permission to retain

photocopies of those reports on which we had worked merely

as record copies of our efforts on behalf of the Commission.

It was felt that if a question should arise at that time

concerning what analytic efforts had been involved and the

number of manhours expended, a record copy would prove useful.

No operational use was made

of these documents except to

hold them on file for a period of time which cannot now be

determined. To the best of our present knowledge, the photo-

copies have now been destroyed.

Absolutely no results

relevant to the assassination were obtained through NSA's

analytic look at the exhibits.

of Mr. Allan Dulles, had asked Dr. Tordella, informally, to

1 hat kod ping,

The Commission, in the person

review the exhibits

for any secret writing or codes which.

might have

been contained in the documents.

DI. Tordella,

after causing 'a careful review of the documents by NSA crypt-

analysts, reported verbally to Mr. Dulles and other Commission

members that nothing whatsoever had been achieved by the

analytic effort. No written reply was submitted.

Para. 2. - NSA is uncertain as to what is precisely

meant by these comments, but we assume that the comments on

names refer to our biographic files which are maintained on

foreign personalities of potential intelligence significance.

As the Committee knows, these biographic files are maintained

(now at CIA incidentally) as analytic support. It is also

possible that the Commission was referring to the fact that

names are frequently seen in traffic collected for foreign

intelligence purposes and therefore NSA might have access

to foreign names not otherwise available to the Intelligence

Community.

Para. 3. - It may well be that CIA did obtain such

transmissions and pass them to NSA for analysis, but no one

presently working that analytic area recalls such a request.

Discussions with Dr. Tordella also failed to shed any light

on this subject.

There are no files or records which we have

been able to locate from that time frame which would sub-

stantiate such a claim. In fact, the only file the responsible

analytic group has been able to locate concerning a request

from the Warren Commission deals with a file compiled from

open sources citing major dates in the last months of Oswald's

life.

Presumably the date file was to be compared with NSA

product on/about the key dates in the hope that something

could be deduced. The file does not contain any "hits."

The analysts who performed this effort have since retired.

Para. 4. - The informal request from Mr. Dulles is

the known total extent of NSA's role in assisting in the

file thus far recovered. There is no information which can

transmissions relating to the assassination.

Para. 5. - We have no information on this subject

at all.

However, pursuant to the subject raised during the

Tordella interview, we have searched our files manually,

and as Mr. Lowman agreed during the Tordella interview,

we

have recovered three product reports (Inclosures 2 through

4) which show that Cuban military forces did go on alert

immediately after the assassination.

There is no SIGINT

evidence, however, that the Cuban forces were alerted prior

to the assassination, thereby suggesting that they had prior

knowledge of the event.

Mr. Thomas K. Latimer

Special Assistant to the Secretary

Washington, D. C. 20301

Dear Tom:

In connection with the Select Committee's investigation of

the assassination of President Kennedy, we earlier received

answers to certain questions put to NSA.

Since then we have

examined other material pertaining to NSA's contribution to

the Warren Commission's investigation and we desire further in-

formation from NSA.

By way of background for this request, we note the Warren

Commission provided NSA various documents and asked NSA to re-

view them for any cryptological significance. NSA found no

cryptological significance and its report of this fact was pub-

lished by the Commission.

By letter of July 10, 1964, (a copy of which is attached)

Mr. Rankin provided General Blake a copy of certain documents

requested by Dr. Tordella for NSA's files. Since NSA's analysis

of the documents was apparently completed at the time of Rankin's

letter, we wish to know why NSA wanted to keep these documents

for its file. Further, we wish to know what use. lI any, was

made of these documents and what results relevant to the assassina-

tion were obtained from such use.

2.

In a Commission staff internal memorandum, discussing the

documents provided NSA, it is reported that NSA is "primarily

interested in names," and NSA claims it has

"information on names

which the CIA does not have."

Assuming these statements are ac-

curate, we wish to know what significance such names would have _

LO NSA and what information on names NSA had that CIA did not.

If names had significance, what names did NSA use in its analysis?

3.

We are informed that CIA obtained transmissions from the

Soviet Embassy in Mexico City for November or December 1963 and

that it may have passed these to NSA for analysis. Did NSA re-.

ceive these transmissions or any transmissions relevant to the

assassination inquiry?

Did it analyze them?

What were the re-

sults of its analysis? *

4.

We are interested in learning the extent of' NSA's role in

assisting in the investigation of the assassination.

In that

connection, please inform the Committee the extent of NSA files

relating to the assassination. Please provide the staff of the

Committee

access to those files.

Please provide the staff with

a summary of all information NSA developed from Cuban or Soviet

transmissions relating to the assassination.

5. We have been informed that after the assassination the

Cuban government instructed its embassies and consulates to re-

turn all files on Oswald to Cuba.. What information does NSA

have on whether

such instructions were issued?

6. In connection with the answers to questions 4 and 5, please

indicate whether such material

- was provided the Warren Commission

and provide copies of all documents evidencing that fact.

We would appreciate receiving a response to these questions

as possible and to expedite this inquiry we are sending

a copy of this letter to Mr. Foster of NSA.

ALERT IN ORIENTE PROVINCE BELIEVED TO BE TERMINATED

The alert in Ortente Province (see 2/0 7R196-63) 18 be-

leved to be teruinated. The alert,' apparently prompted by

President KENNEDY's death on 22 November, was possibly pre-

schrduled to teruinate on 25 Noverber. There Have been two orders

which suggest that the alert was destined to be concluded on

25 November; they are:

• 1)

Access to the Coastal Observation Post at Punta,

Maisi (20-15N 74-0SW) vas restricted until 25 November because

of the alert (see 2/QS/

R667-63) ; and,

•2) " Subordinates' of Banes, Headquarters Eastem Nával

District, were to recelve further orders on the 25ch, presimably

concerning their alert' status (210. 1176-63); no such orders

have been noted in cornications.

There have been no further references in intercepted communi-

cations to the alert sinca 02222 on 23 Novenuer (2/QS/[ R667-63).

It is possible that the restricted access to the Observation

Post at Punta Valsi extends to other Observation Costs in Oriente

Province such as reported on 23 Novesher when Plist Army Coastal

Observation Posts were placed in an alert status

R138-63), aud that the restriction was to be lifted on

23 lovember by all chose posts.

Furthe: Indication that the alert has tominated is the fact

inal che Cuban Nary was engaged in'an islard-aide communications

exercise on 25 Nortober.

It is congidered unlikely that such an

exercise incula be cunducted unier alert conditions.
