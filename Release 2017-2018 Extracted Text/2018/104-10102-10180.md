erson of varied interests.

was born in (Mozyr) in the

ussian Ukraine in (17 April) 1911 and fled Russia with hi

parents in 1921 during the civil disorder following the

revolution. He was in a Polish cavalry military academy for

1 1/2 years. Later he studied in Antwerp

and attended the

University of Liege from which he received a doctor's degree

in international commerce in 1928.

Soon thereafter, he emi-

grated to the United States; he became a U.S.

citizen in 1949.

De Mohrenschildt

jungle trails.

By happenstance they were in Guatemala City

at the time

of the Bay of Pigs invasion.

A lengthy film and

complete written log was prepared by

de Mohrenschildt and a

report of the trip was made to the U.S. Government.

arriving in Panama they journeyed to Haiti where de Mohren-

schildt eventually became involved in a Government-oriented

business venture in which he has been engaged continuously

since June 1963 . . ..

Somewhat of a non-conformist, de Mohrenschildt was a

peripheral member of the

Russian community,

in Dallas,

with which Lee Harvey Oswald made contact through Peter Gregory,

1 Russian-speaking petroleum engineer whom Oswald met as i

result of his contact with the

Texas Employment Commissio

office in Fort Worth.

Occasional contacts with de Mohrenschildt

and his wife continued until May 1963 when

De Mohrenschildt appears to have lead

and colorful life as a petroleum engineer

and businessman.

He is both well and poorly connected, and some of his

associations have raised serious questions.

(See paragraph

10 below.)

Certainly his relationship with the Oswald's

has caused this Agency and the FBI to spend more time and

on him in the past than was necessary:

Both the FBI

and this Agency, however, had dropped their

interests in

de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late 1960's.

For a short time he worked for the

In 1960 he divorced her

1961 was living with a Filipino male.

Oltmans was admitted

Indications are that he was being used

b. In March 1960 Oltmans described himself as anti-

communist.

He stated his views are at best those of a great

admirer of communism and what the communist system represents.

He was described as having excellent contacts with all the

communist-dominated countries, including Cuba.

Although Oltmans may be described as an unscrupulous

publicity seeker,

his contacts with the Soviets (not fully

explained) and de Mohrenschildt add a sinister quality which,

unless proven to be otherwise, may have an adverse effect

upon the Agency's role in the present investigation into

the Kennedy assassination.
