Enclosed is a copy of a self-explanatory memorandum

from Legat, Bern, requesting information which will establish

that Gus Alex is

the individual who is the subject of the

Swiss entry ban previously referred to.

It is noted that Swiss authorities have requested

an early reply and you should consequently furnish appropriate

NOTE:

Chicago hoodlum Gus Alex and his paramour visit Switzerland

each winter on vacation and Legat Bern has established appropriate

coverage in past years through Swiss authorities.

Following last

visit of Alex during past winter Swiss authorities issued a prohibit-

ion aganst Alex's re-entry into the country on the basis that he

was an undesirable.

Alex has appealed and Swiss police now advise

they feel there is

some question of identity as to whether there are

two persons by the name of Gus Alex involved and have requested

further verification concerning this.
