NOTE: Chicago hoodlum Gus Alex and his paramour visit Switzerland
each winter on vacation and Legat Bern has established appropriate

‘| coverage in past years through Swiss authorities. Following last

; visit of Alex during past winter Swiss authorities issued a prohibit-

| ion agdnst Alex's re-entry into the country on the basis that he

| was an undesirable. Alex has appealed and Swiss police now advise
‘ \ they feel there is some question of identity as to whether there are
uae | two persons by the name of Gus Alex involved and have requested
further verification concerning this.
