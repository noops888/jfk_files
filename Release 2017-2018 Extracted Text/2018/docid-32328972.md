Copies of this memorandum have been furnished

to each Office which received a copy of referenced Bureau

letter and which may obsain information of pertinence

in this matter from time to time. It is believed that

this memorandum may assist these Offices in the

evaluation of such

data when received

Information set forth in Miami letter with

enclosed memorandum dated December 22, 1961, regarding

statements of ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOTO have not been

included in this summary memorandum in view of the fact

statements; GUTIERREZ himself said that he was mis

quoted and

no other sources have furnished any similar

data:

"In connection with

sources of information in

Cuba among Cuban exiles here, it has been ascertained

that Italian diplomatic personnel, including the Italian

Ambassador to Cuba, have been assisting the underground

groups in maintaining some contact with those in the

United States. Panamanian and Brazilian Embassy personnel

also are known to have acted as couriers for the under-

ground.

HECTOR FEBLES, mentioned in the enclosed

memorandum, has advised

that the new Brazilian Ambassador

is not trusted by the Cubans in Cuba because of the

support that the new Brazilian government has exhibited for

the CASTRO regime. Therefore, Brazilian Embassy personnel

are no longer being used.

There oxe,

In addition, the Panamanian

Ambassador and the Venezuelan Ambassador are of no

further value, since diplomatic relations between those

countries and Cuba have

been severed.

With one exception, the individuals contacted

with regard to underground organizations in Cuba either

denied knowing the identity of the leaders there or

refused to furnish their names.

Therefore, a section

devoted to the underground leadership has not been

included in this memorandum. The one exception was

IGNACIO MENDOZA of the MRP and information regarding

the present MRP leader was included in the MP section.

It was further noted that sources denied being able to

furnish an estimate of the strength of the groups,

including those to which they, themselves, belonged or

the relative strengths in the

six individual provinces.

In this connection, it is noted that MM T-11,

who is in charge of an infiltration squad of 30 men

change he

operating under the direction of CIA] and who is

obviously in an excellent position to furnish accurate

information regarding the present status of the under-

ground in Cuba, has advised that rebel activity in

Cuba is extremely limited and that reports to the

contrary are gross exaggerations.
