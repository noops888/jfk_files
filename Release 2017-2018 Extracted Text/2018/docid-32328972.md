f Information set forth in Miami letter with
enclosed memorandum dated December 22, 1961, regarding
statements of ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO have not been
included in this summary memorandum in view of the fact
i . that there has been no substantiation of his reported
cas statements; GUTIERREZ himself said that he was mis-

quoted and no other sources have furnished any similar
data,

“In connection with sources of information in
Cuba among Cuban exiles here, it has been ascertained
that Italian diplomatic personnel, including the Italian
Ambassador to Cuba, have been assisting the underground
groups in maintaining some contact with those in the
United States. Panamanian and Brazilian Embassy personnel
’ also are known to have acted as couriers for the under-
ground. HECTOR FEBLES, mentioned in the enclosed
memorandum, has advised that the new Brazilian Ambassador
is not trusted by the Cubans in Cuba because of the
support that the new Brazilian government has exhibited for
the CASTRO regime, Therefore, Brazilian Embassy personnel
are no longer being used, In addition, the Panamanian
Ambassador and the Venezuelan Ambassador are of no

countries and Cuba have been severed.

with regard to underground organizations in Cuba either
denied knowing the identity of the leaders there or
refused to furnish their names, Therefore, a section
devoted to the underground leadership hag not been
included in this memorandum. The one exception was

operating under the direction of CIAj] and who is
obviously in an excellent position to furnish Wie

contrary are gross exaggerations,
