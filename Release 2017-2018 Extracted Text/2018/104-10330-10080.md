FROM: Jeremy Gunn

SUBJECT: ARRB Questions Submitted for DO Briefing

I would like to address some of the concerns that you expressed at our meeting
yesterday, where we briefly discussed the Review Board’s Proposed Questions for the
March 17 briefing regarding DO records. We understand that you have some concerns
about the scope of the topics raised. We very much appreciate your recognition of the
importance that we attach to the ARRB’s independence and we again wish to
emphasize the fact that we fully understand your proper concern for the protection of
information that is unrelated. to the Kennedy assassination.

I would like to emphasize that the questions that we sent to you were not intended as in
depth research queries, but rather as topical talking points for discussion. We prepared.
the questions, at your request, in order to give the persons conducting the briefing an
understanding of the types of issues in which we were interested. They represent issues
that we wish to explore in our quest for additional information and records to facilitate
the completion of the ARRB’s responsibilities under the JFK Act.

We appreciate your acknowledgment that the ARRB is not necessarily obligated to
justify to CIA the questions it deems relevant to the assassination. Nevertheless, in
order to facilitate and coordinate our efforts, we are very willing to offer the following
additional explication of those questions that we understand may have been considered
by the Agency to be excessively broad.

Question # 5:
We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on the
Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1 and
December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?

Until very recently, we had seen no evidence that CIA hadGnicrophone surveillancd of
the Cuban compound. However, Dispatch HMMW 12454 (no IDEN number attached)
found in Box 23, Folder 9 of the Sequestered Collection, makes reference to LICOOLs

(Concealed microphones inside the Cuban Embassy)in Mexico City). Though the

ispatch reports that the last LICOOL ceased functioning in 1961—-before the period in

question—-the prior existence of this capability and the fact that the dispatch discusses
the possibility of reactivation prompts the question of whether all technical and
surveillance operations against the Cuban and Soviet Consulates have been identified
to the ARRB. In addition, the dispatch refers to MKTRAP, a telephone hot mike
operation which was re-actuated from a basehouse in November 1963. The specific hot
mike telephone PBIMPULSE appears to have been in operation during 1963. Are there
records from this operation? Are there any other operations that may have picked up
Oswald’s visit?

Question # 6:
How can a search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of technical production that were available
at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production still exists,
where would it be-stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to retrieve any
additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records exist of the
destruction?

This question is a follow up to question #5. If MKTRAP was in operation from
September 1-December 1, 1963, where are the records or transcripts describing the take?
Was the take ever retained or reviewed? Do any original tapes or transcripts still exist?
Where might these records be found? Were any other technical operations in progress?
The various project files for the technical operations known to exist during this period
are spotty and incomplete. How can the ARRB know if it has reviewed records of all
the technical operation take for the relevant time period?

Question #9:
Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How could a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?

The two 1967 Ramparts articles mention connections between the Agency and
journalists worldwide. The primary focus of this question is on any connection between
the Agency and any journalist who might have covered the assassination domestically.
Additionally, we would be interested in any publishing company involved in
publishing books about the assassination. HSCA staff notes (RIF 180-10142-10087)
summarize several files dealing with contacts between the Agency, publishing houses,

and authors. For example, the file identified as QKOPERA/Liaison ZRBLESS outlines
amemo by cA/ PROP on the status of negotiations between
Praeger Publishing and Milovan Djilas. ZRBLESS is identified as a subproject of
WUBONBON. Further, the staff notes mention a project involving "Praeger and
publication" [sic], a separate project involving "the Freedom Fund and distribution"
[sic], and a third project to provide news service to the foreign press through
Continental Press. Each of these projects appears to have been in operation in 1963-64.

Question # 10:
Did the Agency have any relationship, projects or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency hada
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?

This question is a follow up to question #9. One record that is already in the collection

. (RIF 180-10142-10087) summarizes the Project File of WUPUNDIT and notes two ‘one

time only’ operations in 1963-WURAISIN and WUTRANSIT which were responsible
for publishing two books each. In addition, WUSENDER is reported to be a ‘one time
only’ operation responsible for three books in 1964. If these books have domestic
implications or are on subjects related to the assassination, they would be relevant
documents.

We hope that this additional explication may help you and the DO understand our
approach to the issues raised in our questions. Should any of our requests impose on
you or your staff a burden that we may not have anticipated — or which would entail
work of dubious value or benefit -- please advise us so that we can work with you to
modify or amend the requests accordingly.

1, “The. Station's ‘use ‘of certain eryptonyms identifying technical
Operations against PBRUMEN IPELIDE in Mexico has caused confusion in
Headyjuarters elements ‘regponsible for sourcing and dissemination of
‘Anformation produced, and ‘for supporting the entire complex of

perations itaelf.: The cryptonyms in question are (a) LIFEAT
.()) LIERODE (c) MKTRAP (d). EIcooL/11 and (e) PBIMPULSE. The original
meaning of ‘these cryptonyms 15 being forwarded under separate cover.

2. The. purpose of this dispatch is to submit for Station comment
“a review of the technical operational effort against PBRUMEN TPELIDE
Bince ita inception.. The objectives are (1) to complete Headquarters
records which lack considerable detail concerning the intricacies of
the operation, (2) to ‘urgé:a more precise use of cryptonyms in
reporting this activity. which would benefit Headquarters personnel
responsible for monitoring and supporting those operations and (3) to
suggest a few administrative adjustments which would dispel the presen’

confusion mentioned. in this dispatch.

3.. Tho initial effort against the target was PBIMPULSE:- It was
introduced into the target using LIFEAT assets and was actuated from
the LIFEAT VY basetouse. This is mentioned only to complete the record
and dves not pertain tothe intent of this discussion. Properly
speaking the initial effort begins with the activation of LIFEAT/
LIERODE ia February 1959, as indicated in MGA 12358, Subsequently
eight (8) LICOOL attempts were made during 1960-1961 against the sane
target. The LICOOLS. were monitored from a mobile LP (not LIFIRE),
Basehouse ABLE and Basehouse BAKER, and the latter came to be referred
to as the LIERODE base. The most productive operation of this sort
goems to have been LICOOL/11, activated on 9 Hay 1959, according to
MEXI 3884, dated 15 May 1959. ‘According to our records the last LICOO!

4. At that time a different technique was planned. The followin;
briefly outlines the development of the operations which the Station
habitually refers. to as "NKTRAP": :

. 5 February 1962: Request for operation received at
MKCHARITY by Harvey C. MULFORD.

8 Feb,-Mar.1962;. Design and construction of KXTRAP.

9 March 1962 : MKTRAP delivered to LIFEAT CO for

Placexent in target area,

i 10 March 1962 : MKTRAP installed by LIFEAT assets and

initial LP tests performed from LIFEAT VI basehouse
with negative results.

14. March 1962. ; LP tests conducted with revised series
line connections with positive results.

6-13 April 1962; Design and construction of LP equipment,

16 april 1962 ; “nstallaction of LP equipaent in
LIFEAT VI basehouse.

METRAP, although moved from room to room, remained in place within
the target area, though inactive nost of the time. During November
1963 METRAP was re-actuated from a second LIFEAT basehouse known as

Basetiouse CHARLIE.
5. The photo surveillance of PBRUMEN TPELIDE was put into effect,|
using basehouse BAKER (LIFRODR Rase) at the same time that MKTRAP was
actuated. This photo coverage, the basehouse, PBRUMEN TPRLIDE and the

activity for which the cryptonym was first authorized have all been
identified as LIERODE which has created considerable confusion here at

Headquarters.

8, According to scanty Meadquarter's records the following
operations have utilized these bases against the target:

b. LICOOLs

e. PHOTO

Headquarters has the impression that the principal factors that
contributed to thé suspension of MKTRAP activity from LIFEAT VI,. were
the physical deterioration of the house itself and the divorce of the
baschouse keepers. The current LIFEAT Project Oytline indicates that
LIFEUD 14 atid LIFEUD 17 were obtaining a divorce and were terminated
as of 30 September 1962. Headquarterd assumes they were the occupants
of LIFEAT VI, yet the project outline does not show that the base was
closed, -LIPEAT VI was listed’on page 20 of the outline us an active
unit. On the other hand, page 15 of the outline states that LIFEUD 22
and-LIFEUD 23 are occupying the “LIERODE photo basehouse", but that
they have never been involved in.LIFEAT work. This indicates that
LIFEAT/LISROBE and the photo work against the PBRUMEN target are now
being conducted from two different basehouses, The project outline
also indicates that while it had been planned to have this base serve

“Please confirm the accuracy of the foregoing and supplement it by
- informing Headquarters the basehouses and keepers. involved and the

“LIFEAT/MUXTRAP", technical difficulties made this impossible,
therefore theso two agents were not being included under LIFSAT
Project. Yhon MKTRAP was re-actuated in November 1963 and as stated
above,. the Station utilized another LirSAT basehouse, ‘also called
baschouse. CHARLIE, situatéd approximately six milos fron target,

operations they are currently monitoring.
7. Headquarters requests Station's comments on the following
suggestions:

&. Photographic coveragé. That a separate project be
prepared to-Include LIFEUD 22 and 23. The project should
cover their salaries, basehouse rent, and equipment
expenses, an arrangement similar’ to LITABBY and LIDOGTROT.
This activity, identified with a new cryptonym would
eliminate further confusion ‘when discussing photographic

coverage of PBRUMEN TPELIDE.

b.- LICOOL. Headquarters is not aware of any LICOOLs
presently operative. If any are contemplated, CSI-52-6, 27
February 1958, requires special Headquarters approval prior
to auy action taken, If successful, a decision can be made
at that time whether a new project is necessary or whether
it can adequately be covered under LIFEAT, depending on
the assets being utilized in the operation,

c. LIERODR. The original intent of this cryptonym is

discussed tn the separate cover attachment and the activity
has been assigned file number 50-6-32/6. 1f the operation

utilizes LIFEAT assets, it 1s suggested that it remain
under LIFEAT Project and be identified as LIFEAT/LIE80DS in

all correspondence. Please inform lieadquarters of the assets
presently used for LIFEAT/LIERODE coverage. ;

“KURIOT would prefer the Station. not use this

ad. MRTRAP.
eryptonym in reporting this particular type of coverage.
is suggested that a new cryptonym, in the LI series, be
utilized to reference this activity. The present cryptonyn
refers to a technique which hasprogressed from the
davelopmantal into the operational stage and should more
appropriately be identified with a regular Station cryptonym.
If this operation is being worked by LIFEAT assets, then

At might be identified with a dual cryptonym LIFEAT/LI. A
separate file number, within the LIFEAT series, can be
assigned to cover “MKTRAP" if the Station ‘requests it, but
it does not seem necessary since other LIFEAT eereete do not

have separate file numbers either.
e. Consolidated Project. If the Station prefers, all
technical operations — DE, .MKTRAP, LICOOL, PIOTO -
directed against PBRUMEN TPELIDE can be funded and
administered under one project.

Types of Questions for Follow-up DO Records Briefing
March 17, 1997

1. At what point did the DDP begin to keep records of destroyed records? For
example, in a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Angleton’s
files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained about what had been
done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI’s office was notified."

(p. 143) Where are these records?

2. Could an archival search be run on specific topics for retired records at the CLA’s
Record’s Center? Perhaps an ARRB staffer could be present during the search to review
the abstracts and to suggest other fields or topics to be searched?

3. Could a crypt search for records containing relevant crypts be run through
cryptographic reference? How would queries need to be framed and stated?

4. Why is it so difficult to develop a list for all personnel (official, contract,
administrative, or TDY) assigned to the post referenced in RIF 104-10065-10199?

5. We have been working to identify all technical and surveillance operations in and on
the Cuban and Soviet consulates and embassies in Mexico City between September 1
and December 1, 1963. How can we frame a search query to determine if we have a
comprehensive and complete list of all operations at that time?

6. How cana search query be framed to document all electronic take produced by the
Mexico City Station in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month) and
during the period of Oswald's visit? How can we verify that what exists in the
Sequestered Collection represents all records of the technical production that was
available at the time of the assassination? If additional records or original production
still exists, where would it be stored or filed? What searches could be conducted to
retrieve any additional records? If such electronic take has been destroyed, do records
exist of the destruction?

7. Could you describe the process by which operational funds are proposed, approved,
received, and distributed (circa 1963). What funding and disbursement records exist?
How are they organized? How should a request be formulated to institute a reasonable
search of these records?

8. We have seen DDP monthly operational reports which contain information on the
allocation / distribution of operational funds. Are there other DDP records which would
reflect how certain projects utilized their funding? How are these records organized?
How should a search query be framed?


9. Various open sources have linked the CIA to various journalists and publishing
companies during the 1960's. How should a query be framed to search for connections
between the Agency and journalists or publishing companies?

10. Did the Agency have any relationship, projects, or contacts with publishing houses
during the time of the assassination and in the aftermath of the Warren Commission?
How would a search be formulated to determine whether or not the Agency had a
relationship with any of the same publishing houses that were also publishing books
about the assassination?

11. How would a query be framed to search for files on any office or person dealing
with organized crime and Cuba? How should a request be formulated to institute a
reasonable search on this topic?

12. Is there a comprehensive record or list detailing the identities of individuals on the
Interagency Source Register? How are these records organized? How cana search
query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular individual appears in the
Register.

13. How could a search query be framed to ascertain whether or not a particular
individual was given access to classified information by DCD (then OO)? What kind of
files are assembled in the process of clearing non-Agency contacts/sources for access to
classified information?
