NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER

A. Introduction

During his 11 or 12 years' service in the KGS Secor Chief
Directorate, NOSENKO said, he rose from case officer ty deputy
chief of a department and from lieutenant to lieutenant colonel
(or, as he has stated more recently, only to the rank of captain).
An English speaker, he had specialized in operations against
American targets in the USSR as he steadily advanced to higher
positions in the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department
(from entry on duty with the KG3 in 1952 or 1953 until 1955,
and from January 1960 to January 1962) and in the Tourist Depart-
ment (from June 1955 to January 1960, and from January 1962 until
the defection). His duties took him to England in 1957 and 1958,
Cuba in 1960, and Bulgaria in 1961 as well as to Switzerland in
1962 and 1964; also, NOSENKO made numerous trips within the USSR
in connection with operations, inspections, ard conferences.
Commendations, twice accompanied by bonuses, were awarded to him :
by the KGB Chairman in 1956, 1959, and 1961 and by the head of
the Second Chief Directorate in 1957 and 195. he was one of t
70 Second Chief Directerate officers awarded the Order of the y

‘Red Star in 1962; and in the same year he received a medal for
completing ten years of "irreproachable service. "* Thus,
according to NOSENKO, his defection ended a Promising career

marked by promotions, responsible positions, extensive travel,
and many honors,

NOSENKO has discussed a large number of KGB operations, in-
cluding some in which he had a personal role, either as a par-
ticipant or as a supervisor, and others conducted by other KGB
personnel in the First and Second Chief Directorate about which :
he learned through his professional and personal contacts... i
Those in which he played a personal role are covered in this
part of the paper, All are included in Part VI. The text of
the paper distinguishes the information from collateral sources
and investigations from the details which NOSENKO has Provided
oh the same topics.

WF NOSENKO has admitted recently, however,

that he never got
any awards at all in the KGB.



Be Entry into the KGB

NOSENKO has provided a wide range of dates for his entry
on duty with the KGB and has offered disparate descriptions of
the circumstances and procedures involved in his becoming a
KGB staff officer, His statements on these two topics are
presented under separate headings below.

1. Date of Ertry

A range of dates between early 1952 and 2 April 1953 has
been given by NOSENKO as the time when he entered on duty with
the KGB, bist he has been most consistent in placing his entry
in the month of March 1953.* in summary, he has said the
beginning of 1952 (statement of 31 January 1964), May 1952 with
no day (statement of February 1964), 5 or 7 September 1952
(statement of 6 April 1964)..March 1953 with no day (statements
of 9 June 1962, 24 April 1966 and 27 October 1966), 12 or 15 or
17 March 1953 (statement of 8 April 1964}, 13 or 15 March 1953
(statement*of 26 July 1965), and 2 Aprii 1953 (statement of
17 April 1966), When iast questioned about this subject, on
27 October 1966, NOSENKO acknowledged that he had lied when he
had earlier reported his entry as occurring in 1952. His state-
ments about the entry date are arranged in chronological order
below.

9 June 1962 (first CIA meeting with NOSENKO): “In the
beginning of 1953 I came to Moscow /From duty with the GRU in
Primorsk/. This was 1953, 1n the beginning. in Janzary. Well,
I came on leave to Moscow. I was staying at my father's dacha
there... I was then in the Navy GRU. So I came to Moscow on
leave and, while I was home_near Moscow at my father's dacha,
“General Bogdan Zakharovich/ KOBULOV** dropped in on us. A con-
versation simply began. He said: ‘What are you doing?' I said:
‘I'm working in GRU. I worked in the Far East and now I'm work-
ing in the Baltic. I came here on leave.’ KOBULOV said: 'How
do you like the work?! I replied: ‘Well, speaking honestly, I
don't like the work.' ‘Well,' he said, ‘You better come to work
with us, Wh do you want to co? Into intelligence or counter-
intelligence?'... I did not want to go into intelligence. I

* Several of NOSENKO's remarks about his date of entry into
the KGB were made during CIA questioning abour how and
when he first learned of the KGB agent “ANDREY"; the lead
to “ANDREY" was one of the two pieces of information which
NOSENKO offered to sell when he approached CIA in 1962
(see Part I11.B.); the "ANDREY case is discussed at
greater length in Part VI.D.3.b.

** Other sources have reported that KOBULOV was expelled
from the State Security apparatus in 1946 and that he did
not return to a position of authority until a few days
after Lavrentiy BERIYA became MGB-MVD Minister:on 9 or
10 March 1953. As of 1952, KOBULOV was working in East
Germany for both Wismut A.G., a uranium ore-mining con-
cern, and for the Soviet contingent to the Allied Control
Commission. KOBULOV was arrested at the same time as
BERIYA, along with others in the KGB. See Part V.B.2.
for further references to KOBULOV.

6 April 1964: Confronted with the above inconsistencies,
NOSENKO said that he returned to Moscow in August 1952 and during
the same month had a conversation with KGB personnel about getting
a job. The interview continued with the following dialogue:

Question: You came (to Moscow) in January?

NOSENKO: No, it wasn't January, it was the second part of
1952. Yes, before that I was in the GRU... 4
Maybe - if I tell you 7 - 7 September - maybe
it was 5, I don't know.

NOSENKO: I don'* remember.

NOSENKO: Early September 1952, yes... I came and the

i October 1966: NOSENKO reaffirmed that he entered the

i KGB in mid-March 1953. He said that he had lied when he earlier
said that he had joined the KGB in 1952, and that he knew he was ‘
lying at the times he made these statements. Asked why he had “ys
lied, he replied: “There was no sense." NOSENKO then went on :

because he was a heavy drinker, he had been found unsuitable

by the KGB entry commission when he first applied in 1950.
Therefore, NOSENKO continued, he had been trying to conceal
this fact from CIA by moving events back a year, for he thought
CIA would not have believed him if he reportea that he was
first rejected by the KG and was later accepted.

2. Circumstances and Procedures of Entry |

the KGB with his discussions with General KOBULOV,* he has been : q
inconsistent concerning the content of their conversation, when |

it occurred, its relationship in time to other events’ (see

Part IV.8.), and where it took place, at his father's dacha or
at KOBULOV's dacha. Also, wherees NOSENKO said in 1962 that
there were virtually no administrative formalities prerequisite
to his entry, he recalled in 1964 that he had had conversations
with various KGB personnel officers and (at home) had completed
a KGB questionnaire and a biographic form. NOSENKO was question-
ed at length on these points during 1964 and 1965. As a resvlt,
he provided lengthy descriptions of his various interviews at
KGB Headquarters and of the questionnaire and other documents he
completed. In April 1966, however, NOSENKO reverted to his yiessesies
original statement of 1962: There were no interviews with KGB :
personnel officers, and he implied that he had filled out no } i
official forms. His various statements are presented in chrono- :
logical order below.

, 25 April 1964: NOSENKO again described the KGB question-
naire and autobiographic forms he had filled out at home and
recalled that he had also signed a secrecy agreement in the
personnel office. He also remembered that he had made several
additional phone calls to the KGB personnel office and described
his second visit there to talk to ROZiENKO: “At the end of
February I was told again to stcp in the Pass Office’and pick up
a pass and go to the same floor, but another room. They told me

he just wanted to look me over. -And after that they sai@: ‘All

26 April 1965: NOSENKO recounted his conversation with
KOBULOV, saying that it took piace at KOBULOV's dacna in Usov,
where he and his parents were visiting in January 1953. NOSENKO
continued: "I was called at my family's dacha in February.

They said it was State Security calling and that I was to
report. I did this on the next day. Probably I] thenreported

blank for my autobiography and a four to six-page anketa (bio-

came down, and I gave him the forms and photographs of myself.
They said they would call me. i did nothing from January to
March. January was leave. In February and March I was at GRU
Personnel's disposal." After STALIN's funeral NCSENKO was
summoned to KOBULOV's office. His assistant, SAVITSKIY, told
NOSENKO to wait. After more than an hour had passed, SAVITSKIY
sent him to SHUBNYAKOV's office. There he learned that he would
be assigned to the U.S. Embassy Section and was introduced to
the Chief of the American Department, GORBATENKO, The official
order appointing NOSENKO was issued the same day, the 13th or
,iSth of March 1963.

24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement: Again
NOSENKO said that he had spoken with KOBULOV at the KOBULOV
dacha and set the date at 1 January 1953. The document con-
tinued as follows: "I saw KOBULOV for the second and last time

Cc. To June 1955 (American Department)

1. Introduction |”
=_z———

Depending upon which date he has given fer entering the KGB,
NOSENKO's first assignment in the U.S. Embassy Section of the
American Department, working on American correspondents living
in Moscow, lasted for about six to eighteen montas. From that
job, he said, he moved in 1954 to operations against U.S.. Mili-
tary Attaches assigned to the Moscow Embassy, remaining in the
same section until being transferred in June 1955. His activi-
ties, as NOSENKO described them, and pertinent collateral infor-
mation on his targets while he was in the U.S, Embassy Section
are reviewed: below.

2. Operations Against Correspondents

On the day cf his acceptance into the KGB, NOSENKO was
taken directly to the offices of the U.S. Emhassy Section.
There he met the section chief, V.A. KOZLOV, wno told NOSENKO
that he would take over the work of the departing case officer, ;
Captain Anatoliy TORMOZOV, in operations against American cor~ t
respondents in Moscow. : +

1 a. KGB Files on SHAPIRO, GILMORE, SALISBURY and WHITNEY

When NOSENKO reported for work the following day, accord~
ing to statements made on 8 April 1964, he found a desk in Room
615, “There were three other guys sitting there. At first I :
was running traces, and at the same time I was reading. the files i
on journalists... I think there were seven files in all, and I |
didn't see any other." NOSENKO listed these files as those on |

i
:

Henry SHAPIRO, Eddy GILMORE (as well as one cn GILMORE's wife
SEREBRYAXOVA and her sister CHERNYSHEVA), Harrison SALISBURY
and Thomas WHITNEY.*

SHAPIRO as an “old agent of ours." He said that WEITNEY “worked
for us while he was in Moscow and gave us some material, but he
refused to work for us when he left the country and would not
contact us in the United States." GILMORE, NOSENKO said, was an
active recruitment target in 1953 and 1954, but NOSENKO did not
know whether he was recruited. Likewise, he did not know the
status of SALISBURY as of 1953.

correspondents “recruited as agents by the KGB. +



files were held by the chief of the section, KOZLOV. NOSENKO
stated that he read the files on these seven perscns “slowly
and made some extracts for myself in my personal log=-such things
as notations of their dates of arrival, things I could not remem-
ber." He was also given the files.on the agents surrounding
these correspondents, their drivers, maids, and ccoks.

b. Agents Reporting on Correspondents

NOSENKO said he was responsible for handling the agents who
were reporting on SHAPIRO, WHITNEY, SALISBURY and the GILMOREs
and met with them regularly to learn whether "anything was new,
who did SHAPIRO meet, what might be interesting in his behavicr,
what might be suspicious in his behavior, who he is contacting,
etc." He then reported to KOZLOV and would sometimes prepare 4
written report of his conversations with the agents. Asked to
describe these meetings, NOSENKO replied: "Let us take the same
case of SHAPIRO. I would meet drivers about three times. a month
or even two times, At the meeting I would ask the driver what
was new in SIiAPIPC's behavior since our last meeting, whether

suspicious he calls immediately, and I would see Aim the next
morning, Otherwise, I would tell him at the meeting that I

there was something interesting ne should call immediately.

It was the same with the maid and the cook. Upon returning to
the office I would have to report to KOZLOV about my meetings,
either orally or in writing. If, for example, [V.M.]‘ KOVSHUK
{aiso Of the U.S. Embassy Section) had a meeting with his agents,
he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV or as soon as conveni-
ent to both. If the meetinys were taking place late in the day
and lasted until midnight or later and.there were no written
materials submitted at the meeting, I could go heme and then re-
port the next morning.”

KOZLOV accompanied NOSENKO to meetings with the various
agents surrounding the correspondents. "At first he was teach-
ing me. Then he would go in cases when something interesting
would begin to develop, even when it hadn't yet begun to develop
bet ipsa there may have been a hint in a case of some other case
officer."

NOSENKO's agent network consisted mainly of domestic and
clerical personnel in contact with the correspondents and their
families, Asked to describe them, he said on 15 April 1964:

"My first agent was a woman agent, a cook, who was working at
GILMORE's place. She also worked at the Associated Press later.
Her codename was 'AGLOPINA’, a funny one. My second agent was
a chauffeur whose codename, I think, was 'SERGEY', I think. he
was driving WHITNEY. Then I also had SHAPIRO's chauffeur, a
funny little fellow. In other words, charwomen, chauffeurs,
this was my agentura [agent network]." Although NOSENKO was
able to give a breakdown of this network in terms of the number
and type of agents targetted against particular individuals, he
had forgotten their true names and could not.provide detailed
personality information on any of them.. He explained: "I don't
remember now. They all passed by like a river because they were
turned over often." NOSENKO did recall that it was he who

selected and handled the agent who was placed in SHAPIRO's office. .

as a secretary; this agent had earlier worked in the offices of

i



He first identified GILMORE's cook, “AGLODINA,” as Yelena
S. ROSIENKO in the fall of 1965, while reviewing a list of Sov-
diets employed by Americans in Moscow. He. told CIA at that time

“that he had taken over KOSIENKO from TORMOZOV upon entering the

U.S. Enbassy Section in 1953, and that she subsequently worked
for and reported on GILMORE's successor, Richard KASISCHKE.
NOSENKO said that KOSIENKO "never provided any interesting in~
formation."

NOSENKO estimated that he was responsible for handling 10
to 12 agents in operations against the correspondents. This,
he said, was a normal load, although more experienced case offi-~
cers might have as many as 15. In April 1964 NOSENKO broke his
agentura down as follows:

Target Agents
Eddie GILMORE Iwo agents, the cook and the driver;

one operational contact, a part-time
cleaning girl; and a girlfriend of
GILMORE's sister-in-law, who reported
on the sister-in-law and GILMORE's

wife.
Thomas WHITNEY One agent, his driver.
Henry SHAPIRO Three agents, SHAPIRO's secretary

and his cahuffeur, plus an old woman
who was a relative of SHAPIRO's wife
and lived with the SHAPIROs in Mos-
cow, (The secretary and chauffeur
later worked for Kenneth BRODNEY and
reported on him to NOSENKO; BRODNEY
temporarily took SHAPIRO's place in
Moscow.)

Harrison SALISBURY Two agents, SALISBURY's driver, "SER-
GEY" and a part-time cleaning girl.

NOSENKO classified two other of his agents as “neutral,“ in
that they did not have specific targets on whom to report. The
first of these was the director of MOSGRAN, a Russian-language
training program for foreigners in Moscow. His cryptonym was
*RAKETA,*“ but NOSENKO could not recall his true name. The sec-
ond, "VOLODINK,” was a female teacher in this same program who
instructed some of the correspondents, including BRODNEY, and
Embassy employees in their homes; he could not recall the true
name of "VOLODINK." When NOSENKO was relieved of his responsi-
bility for the correspondents in 1954, he turned over all of his
agents to other case officers in the U.S. Embassy Section with
the exception of “RAKETA" and "VOLODINK," whom he continued to
handle in his work with military attaches.

@. Information from Other Sources

SHAPIRO was identified as a KGB agent. by GOLITSYN in 1961,
before the lead.was received from NOSENKO, and he had previously
been suspected as such on the basis of his long stay in Moscow,
his unusually good access to Soviet information sources, and his
marriage to a Soviet national. SHAPIRO was mentioned as a KGB

agent by a eryptonym (known to NOSENKO and confirmed by GOLITE
appearing in the CHEREPANOV papers. * i

pte The KGB defector Nikolay KHOKLOV had earlier identified the naire
Polish-born wife of WHITNEY’as a XGB agent, an allegation which z
she denied, and it had been ‘long assumed that WHITNEY too had
reached some sort of accommodation with the KGB because of this
fact and because of the long duration of his tour as a correspond-
ent in Moscow,

GILMORE also had been suspected by CIA before NOSENKO's in-
formation was received. He served in Moscow for 12 years, from
1941 to 1953, and 18 married to a Soviet national.

SALISBURY served two short tours, of about one year each, ft
in Moscow during the 1950's. During the second of these, he }
became enamored with the Pole who was to become WHITNEY's wife !
(see above) and was during this period a subject of criticism by
other American correspondents in Moscow for his pro-Soviet arti-
cles, When WHITNEY married the Pole shortly after STALIN's
death, SALISBURY returned to the United States and his articles
took on an anti-Soviet tone. :

watt anabeaiteatiaee

NOSENKO claimed no involvement with the other two american
correspondents whom he identified as KGB agents, STEVENS and
STEIGER, both the subjects of a considerable amount of derogatory
information in CIA files. They are discussed in Part VI.D.2. i
under the heading of NOSENKO's American leads. i

3. Operations Against Military Atteche Personnel

fl
Some time in the first half of 1954 NOSENKO was. relieved of |

his responsibilities for the correspondent cases, and from then

until his transfer from the American Department he handled KGB

Second Chief Directorate operations against the officer person-

nel of the U.S, Military Attache's office. NOSENKO's account of

the turnover of the correspondent files to his successor and of

the acceptance of the attache files is presented below. |

we taaabs bible wen

Sranasaaz - April 1964: "I took over the Military Attache cases
from Nikolay KHRENOV... When I was leaving in 1955, I turned
the attache files over to Valeriy BUDYLDIN.”

- 10 April 1964: "I made a mistake... I said I accepted
the cases from KHRENOV when I was taking on the Militery Attache
work, This is not right. KHRENOV was not working in the First
(U.S. Embassy) Section; he was working in the First (Anerican)
+ : Department. I took over the cases from--let's see, there was
ZHUKOV and Vladimir Aleksandrovich CHURANOV, and here was my
_ table (desk), and I accepted the cases from Pavel Fedorovich p
PANKRATOV. This was in the beginning of 1954." *

- 15 April 1964: NOSENKO said that he thought he turned
' over the correspondent files to.F.V. KISLITSYN (who returned. -
i. to the USSR from Australia in’May 1954), NOSENKO asked when’ i

|. Rot sure about KISLITSYN and could have given them to another
officer, “If KISLITSYN came {back from Australia] in 1953, then
it was to KISLITSYN. Otherwise, it was someone else."

+ 18 June 1964: “KISLITSYN came into the First Section in
1954 and I gave him the files on American correspondents. BUDYL~
DIN also joined the section this year and took the files on the

Attache and his assistants from PANXRATOV. BUDYLDIN left
later that year and turned those files over to me... Yuriy
LEONTIYEV joined the section in 1955, and I gave him the files
on the Army Attache and his assistants.“

NOSENKO has also been indefinite as to the date he, assumed
responsibilities for the attaches. As noted above, he said on
10 April 1964 that he received the files in the beginning of
1954. He had earlier said that he worked on the correspondents
“only about six months." If the date of March 1953, which he
most often gave for his entry *nto the KGB, is correct this would
place the turnover in the fall of 1953. On other occasions he
has said specifically that he turned over the correspondent cases
and began work against the attaches in January 1954, on still
others that this occurred in May 1954. In February 1965, NOSENKO
said that he could not remember when he changed assignments.

a. Agents Reporting on Military Attaches

Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network
{agentura) at his disposal in operations against U.S. Mili-
tary Attaches during this period which began in 1954, NO-
SENKO replied: "There were two maids, a cook, drivers*...
about ten persons, plus the agent 'SERVIZNIY' and the one
with the code name 'DMITRIYEV'.,. These additional two
agents, about 12 or 13 agents altogether." With one ex-
ception, this network remained constant until NOSENKO trans=
ferred from the U.S. Embassy Section in mid-1955, He met
each agent about once a week, except for the chauffeurs who
were met three times a month in a safehouse or on the
street. According to NOSENKO, this network was “just a
supporting agentura, which very seldom was worthwhile," the
: main source of information on the Military Attaches being the
microphones in their cffices.** i

Newly added to the network while NOSiNKO held this
position was a maid inserted to report on Army Attache Earl
L. MICKELSON and his successor, Fillmore K, HEARNS. Her
name, .NOSENKO thought, was NOVIKOVA. She was an English-
speaking university graduate but "hid her knowledge of
English in order to overhear conversations or read letters
without taking them outside.”

Besides NOVIKOVA, NOSENKO named one other maid who was
his agent, Mariya NEVEROVA, code name “SHVEDOVA," and she
was targetted against the Assistant Army Attache, Ira
RICHARDS. He described NEVEROVA as a “little, old,’ thin
oman," from whom he never obtained anything of. interest
They met in a safehouse on Kuznetskiy Most,

Of the KGB agents among the chauffeurs, NOSENKO identi-
fied Nikolay SHNYRYEV, who was used by various of the at-
taches. "He reported where they went, what they said,
whether they took notes or photographs, whether they had
unusual packages with them, and so on.”

then viewing photographs in September 1964, NOSEWKO
identified Vladislav VOROBYEV as the agent "SERVIZNIY." He
had been working in the Embassy since its establishment,
starting first as a messenger boy and, in NOSENKO's time,
performing clerical tasks. VOROBYEV had no direct connec-
tion with the Military Attaches, and NOSENKO said he himself
did not know why he had been given VOROBYEV to handle in
1954. The main function of this agent was delivering to
NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephone listings of the
Embassy, issued monthly.

"DMITRIYEV's" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV:
NOSENKO saw this name on a 1962 phone list and thought, but
was not sure, that this was his agent. An electrician who :
worked on the Embassy's electrical wiring systems and eleva-
tor, "DMITRIYEV" reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires and

® ~The Wilitary Attaches used a pool of. five drivers at random,
NOSENKO said. Apart from the permanent driver for the senior
eee attache, none were targetted. against individual members of the

* attache office. ~~ i

Embassy. : :

eee dere



other wires he had observed in the. Embassy as well as on the
security measures on the top floors. Like VOROBYEV, “DMITRI -
YEV" had no direct connection with the Military.Attaches.

In September 1964 NOSENKO was shown a series of 260 bio-
graphic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American En-
bassy in Moscow. Each card contained a photograph of the per=
son involved and short biographic notes, including his name
and job in the Embassy. The first time.he went through these.
cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see only, the photographs; NO~
SENKO did not identify the photographs of SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV
but said that the face of VOROBYEV was familiar, adding that
he thought his name was VOROBYEV, When shown the biographic
information on SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV, he identified each of then
as his agents during the 1954-1955 period in the American De-
partment and equated them to the cryptonyms given previously.
In the case of SHNYRYEV, when shown the bicgraphic information,
which listed SHNYRYEV as “chauffeur for the jitary Attache,"
NOSENKO exciaimed: "Oh my God, this is my own agent." He
later said it was a good photograph of SHNYRYEV.

b. NOSENKO's Targets

As the Second Chief Directorate case officer responsible
for operations against American Military (Aray) Attaches sta-
tioned in Moscow,* his main task was not to recruit them but
rather was to prevent the attaches from collecting intelligence.
He has used this statement. abouc his main task (identical with
that of other U.S, Embassy Section officers working against
the Army and Navy Attaches) to support his claim that no U.S.
Armed Forces Attaches vere recruited by the KGB from 1953 un-
til his defection in 1964. He has also said that this 1s one
reason he knows relatively little about the personal back~
grounds of his various targets during this period--the empha-
sis was on surveillance instead of development for recruitment—
purposes. Asked in February 1965 to list the Army Attache per~
gonnel for whom he was directly responsible during 1954 and
1955, NOSENKO gave the following names: "MICKELSON, MEARNS,
RICHARDS, FELCHLIN, BENSON, MULE, STROUD, and CARDELLA."** His
knowledge. of the activities of these targets and of KGB action
against them, coupled with information from other sources, is
discussed in the following paragraphs.

faval Attaches wore handled by ZHUKOV during this period, NO-
SENKO said, while Air Attaches were initially handled by CHURA-
NOV. When CHURANOV left the section in early 1954, he turned
over the Air Attache files to PANKRATOV, who turned them over
later in the year to KHRENOV.

**This is the order given by NOSENKO. The list comprises two
generations of Army Attaches in Moscow and is neither in al-
phabetical order nor in terms of date of service in Moscow.

It is, however, in descending order of rank from Colonel MICKEL-
SON through Captain MULE ‘to ‘Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA.
Questioned about these officers in a different’ context, NOSENKO
indicated knowledge of their ranks. Not mentioned by NOSENKO
was George VAN LAETHEM, Assistant Army Attache in Moscow from
August 1951 to August-1953 (prior to the time when NOSENKO said
he was responsible for work against the military attache office).
VAN LAETHEM returned to Moscow in 1955, however, and was at—
tached to the Army Attache staff again from 19 March to.19 May
1955, during which tine NOSENKO claimed he was still responsible
for this group. i: =

(4) MICKELSON

NOSENKO has identified Earl L. MICKELSON as a colonel
and the Military Attache in Moscow during 1954 and 1955.
PANKRATOV was the case officer originally handling MICKEL-
SON, and the case was turned over to NOSENKO in 1954
When asked about agcnts who might have been working against
MICKELSON, NOSENKO said that there was one cook, a KGB
operational contact whose name he did not recall, and
HICKELSON's maid, whose name NOSEXKO believed was NOVIKOVA;
the cook and NOVIKOYA went to work for MICKELSON after NO~
SENKO had left the U.S. Embassy Section, In uddition to
these two, the only other source reporting on WICKELSON was
his chauffeur, whose name. NOSENKO also did not remember
NOSENKO suid that the KGB learned nothing interesting about
MICKELSON from concealed microphones, telephone taps, or { }
surveillance, and that no operational approach or recruit-
ment was attempted. There was, in fact, no interesting or t 4
derogatory information on MICKELSON from any source. +

According to information in CIA files, MICKELSON was
involved in at least two incidents inside the Soviet Union
which NOSENKO has not reported. In May 1954 he was arrested
in Tbilisi on the (false) charge of having photographed a
bridge, but he persuaded the Militia not to press charges.
In August 1954 MICKEFSON was arrested again for illegal
photographs souli of KHARKOV; on this occasion he was held
for two hours before being released

(ii) MEARNS

NOSENKO identified Fillmore K.. MEARNS as MICKELSON's
replacement and said that he wes the responsible case of-
ficer. There were two agents and one operational contact
working against 'tEARNS. Of these, NOSENKO could recall the
name only of NOVIKOVA, the same maid who reported earlier on
MICKELSON. Besides being told to attempt to overhear MICKEL-
SON's conversations NOVIKOVA was instructed to search his
clothing and tu copy any notes she night find, but she
never overheard or found anything of interest to the KGB.
NOSENKO recalled that MEARNS' personal effects were searched
by the KGB while they were being shipped to Moscow from the
United States, and that all his service records had been
discovered and photographed.* NOSENKO described MEARNS
as being more "active" in Moscow than MICKELSON had been and +
said that information from concealed microphones showed A
him to have a strong character. Nothing of interest con-
cerning him was received from these microphones or from tele- t
phone taps.

CIA has no derogatory or otherwise significant informa- : i :
tion on MEARNS, who replaced MICKELSON.

| (444) RICHARDS

RICHARDS. The one agent reporting on RICHARDS whom NOSENKO
couid name was the maid Mariya NEVEROVA, XGB cryptonym
"SHVEDOVA,"” but she had never provided any worthwhile in-
formation about RICHARDS. In ad ion, some Soviet drivers
repcrted on RICHAKDS, but. nothing useful was cbtained from
then.

According to C1A records, RICIIARDS served in Moscow
from July 1954 to July 1956, There was a microphone in the
office which he shared first with MICKELSON and later with
MEARNS. RICHARDS confirmed that Mariya NEVEROVA was his
maid and described her as a "mousy" woman who had a heart
attack during the period she was employed by him, (This
i lent was not recalled by NCSFNKO.) For about four
months of his Moscow tour, RICHARDS took Russian-language
lessons from Ludmila GROMAKOVA in his apartment. During
these lessons, KICHARI often discussed labor conditions and
wages in the United States and, on one occasion, had her
record her speech on his tape recorder. GROMAKOVA was preg~
nant and unmarried at the time. (NOSENKO has named GROMAKOVA
as a KGB agent in another context but has not mentioned her
tacts with RICHARDS.) * RICHARDS identified one “Volodya"

co!
(i , first name Vladimir) as his principal driver. About
62 ars old in 1954, Volodya was the son of a rich jeweler

in scow during the Revolution. Volodya himself was well
educated and, on one occasion while picnicking outsade Mos-

e spoke intelligently with RICHARDS about the Revolu-
ropaganda, and news media. (NOSENKO did not know of
a.) Purther details from RICHARDS are given in the
ing, section on FRLCHLIN.

(iv) FELCHLIN

NOSENKO identified Noward L. FELCHLIN as a lieutenant
colonel who served as Assistant Army Attache in Moscow and
stated that he was FELCHLIN's case officer. FELCHLIN was in
the Soviet Union during 1954 and part of 1955, until being
declared persona non grata. NOSENKO did not recall the
nams: of any agents specifically targetted against FELCHLIN,
although he thought CHLIN must have had a maid and she
would have been a KGB agent. Additionally, NOSENKO seid,
the Assistant Military Attaches shared a pool of cars and
drivers, and these were his agents. Unable to recall the
precise date of PELCHLIN's expulsion, NOSENKO related it to
some event regarding Soviets stationed in the United States
for which the Soviet Government decided to reply in kind.
NOSENKO was imprecise as to the pretext used to expel FELCH-
LIN, but said the action was based on information which had
been accumulated from a number of sources and incidents.

For example, FELCHLIN had been caught taking some photographs
and a report had been written; along with other similar
indications of FELCHLIN's activities and reports of agents

in contact with FELCHLIN, the report was filed away for pos-
sible future use. NOSENKO was questioned further on FELCH-
LIN during the February 1965 interrogations. te said then
that FELCHLIN alone had been declared persona non grata,

and that no other attaches had been involved. “NOSENKO

explained his having but few details concerning this action
by the fact that it took place after NOSENZO had trans-
ferred from the American Department to the Tourist Depart~-
ment in June 1955, NOSENKO knew nothing of FELCHLIN's
background.

Other sources have reported that FELCiHLIN visited the
USSR as a merchant seaman and a diplomatic courier before
arriving in July 1953 as Army Attache. He served in the
latter capacity for one year, until July 1954, when he was
asked to leave the country. (He had previously served in
Austria and West Germany and had been in official, contact
with known GRU officers at both posts, as well as in the
United States.) During his enti tour in Moscow he was
the subiect of intensive KGB interest. Shortly after his
arrival, in September 1953, FELCHLIN, with fellow Assistant
Army Attache Martin J. MANHOFF, and two Air Force attaches
took a train trip to Siberia, the first such trip permitted
American attaches in many years Six months later, on
25 March 1954, the Soviet newspaper Trud carried an article
saying that PELCHLIN and his companions had lost some of
their “spy documents" on the. train, FELCHLIN said this
charge was false. On another cccasion, while travelling
with a British Miiitary Attache, FELCHLIN returned to his
train compartment to find a scantily clad Soviet female in
his bunk. (NOSENKO recalls neicher of these incidents.)

In June 1954, while in t company of eutenant Colonel F.J.
YEAGER, an Assistant Army Attache, FELCHLIN was arrested in
Kiev by a Soviet Army officer for photographing a military
target. (NOSENKO has never mentioned YEAGER'Ss nat
told the name and asked for an identification, NOS
said that he had heard it and that he thought YEAG
the Aix Force Attache.) A large crowd gathered and, after
some jostling, FELCULIN and YEAGER were taken to a Militia
station where they were ordered to sign a confession, They
were held eleven hours, and their arrest caused the American
ambassador to deliver a strong protest note. FELCHLIN was
told on 3 July 1954 that he had 48 hours to get out of the
Soviet Union. No specific charges were mentioned. Major
Walter A. McKINNEY, the U.S. Air Attache and one of FELCHLIN's
travelling companions at the time the yy notes" were
allegedly lost, was declared persona non grata at the same
time. eee

Queried concerning SHNYRYEV, RICHARDS and FELCHLIN
immediately recognized his photograph and name as one of the
general chauffeurs assigned to. the Office of the Military
Attache at the Moscow Embassy; RICHARDS was taken on his
first trip outside Moscow by SHNYRYEV. He remarked that the

¥—Anbassador BOHLEN Successfully insisted, against initial
Soviet refusal, that his personal plane be allowed into the
USSR to fly FELCHLIN and McKINNEY out. In February 1965
NOSENKO was asked to describe the unusual circumstances
under which FELCHLIN left. NOSENKO said he could not, in-
asmuch as he was no longer in the American Department at
the time. Told that the expulsion took place in 1954,
NOSENKO said this was not the correct date.

attaches referred to SHNYPYEY as either "Nikoley Perviy"
(Nicholes the First) or "Nikolay Vtoroy" (Nicholas the
Second) to distinguish him from the other chauffeur with
the same name. FELCHLIN said that SHNYRYEV drove primarily
for the itary Attache himself, but sometimes drove for
the AssiStant Military Attaches, and he remembered that
SHNYRYEV was not well, suffered froi war wounds, and had
continuing chest or lung trouble. (Asked whether SHNYRYEY
had any medical problen, NOSENKO said he was not aware of
any.)

NOSENKO identified his target John S. BENSON as a
major and Assistant Army Attache in Moscow. He did not
recall the names cf any agents working against BENSCN but
said that BENSON was with MULE and STROUD (sce below) in
Stalingrad in 1955 when ali three were caught by the KGE
with electronic “spying" devices. ‘They were declared per-
sona non grata, The KGB had no other derogatory information

SNSON from any other source.

NOSENKO identified William R. STROUD as a captain and an
Assistant Army Attache, The only agents working against him
were the Military Attaches' drivers. From concealed micro-
phones, the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned before
STROUD's arrival in Moscow that he was an expert in the use of
electronic spying apparatus. le was with BENSON and MULE
in Stalingrad and was declared persona non grata along with
them (see below). Other than this, NOSENKO said, the KGB
knew nothing unusual or interesting about STROUD from any
source.

CIA files show that STROUD was, with BENSON and MULE,
the victim of the Soviets’ seizure of technical equipment
in Stalingrad and was declared persona non grata on 7 May
1955. On 31 January 1955 he travelled to Kharkov from Mos-
cow with First Secretary Frank SISCOE to interview an Ameri-
can defector living there. (According to NOSENKO, SISCOE

(vii) MULE

NOSENKO identified Walter E as an-Assistant Army
Attache end said that he was the case officer responsible
for him. NOSENKO described an operational approach to MULE,
in which he himself participated: In 1953 or 1954 there
had been several defection approaches to Soviets in the
United States on the basis of money and the promise of a
new life. After the KGB Second Chief Directorate decided to
try the same measures, MULE was selected because he was only
a captain despite his lengthy service in the Aray and because
material from concealed microphones indicated that he was
often disparaged by the other attaches. When MULE received
letters from home, he threw them in the trash, and the
maids turned these over to the KGB; from this mail it was
understood that MULE did not have a house in-the United
States but lived with his family in a trailer The father
of two children, MULE had sent his wife from Moscow to Ger-
meny for gn abortion, as a third child would have imposed
too great an economic burden. On the basis of all this the
KGB appointed N,3l. BURODIN, a recruiter of the American De~
partment, to attempt to defect MULH. Together h BORODIN,
KOVSHUK, and L.A, LEBEDEV (from the Second Chier Directorate's
special technical section) NOSENKO travelled to Leningrad
for the operation. LEBED instelled a ciock containing a

concealed camera as well as microphoses in MULE's hotel
room, and BORODIN entered the room to await MULE's return.
When MULE started to enter the room, he caught ght of

BORODIN and tried to back out, but NOSENKO_and KOVSHUK
the h and vented | esi .*
ed MULE” Tacts the KGB had accumulated

kof success in the Army, the disdain of his
fellow attaches, and his shortage of money and then offered
him a job as a "consultant." BORODIN had either $5,000 or
$10,C00 in an envelope to encourage MULE to accept. Ac-
cording to NOSENKO, MULE refused outright, telling BORODIN
to get out, that he would not talk to him, and that he vas
e captain in the American Army.

CIA files show that MULE reported this incident. He
said that he was locked in his hotel room and subjected to
a recruitment attempt by an MVD agent calling himself Jack
SIEGAL, who offered him $10,060 for "work" on a long-range
basis., SIEGAL emphasized that MULE would not be required
to procure documents from the Embassy, and according to
MULE, SIEGAL was aware of facts concerning MULE's personal
life that could have been obtained only from listening de-
vices in MULE's apartment or office. SIEGAL left after about
minutes, having warned MULE not to report the incident
Le was unable to identify NOSENKO's photograph.

After NOSENKO had been transferred to the Tourist De-
partment in 1955, BENSON, NULE and STROUD were the targets
of a KGB operation which resulted in all three men being

declared persona. non grata. NOSENKO gave the following
account of this inéident: For some time the Second Chief
Directorate had boen trying to acquire a small, convenient
piece of olectronic equipment which American Intelligence ~
officers vere known tu be using during their travels inside
the Sovict Union, As early as the beginning of 1954, the*
American, Department had been given authorization from the
Central Courittce of the Communist Party to steal tais
equipment from the Americans, provided that the success of”
such an operation was assurcds Before his transfer to the: *
Tourist Department in 1955, NOSEXKO himself had helped’ to
develop plans for the operation and had even arranged an
abortive attespt to steal the equipment from an attache at

& railroad station outside Moscow. While BENSON, MULE,

and STROUD were or one of their trips (after NOSENKO's trans—
fer) it was learned that they had the equipment with them,
and the KGB decided to take it from them in Stalingrad.

To carry out the operation, Lieutenant General P.V. FRDOTOV,
then Chief of the KGB Sccond Chief Directorate, and A.M.
GORBATENKO, Chier of the American Department, flew with
other personnel from the American Department to Stalingrad.
The hotel rooms of BENSON, STROUD and MULE were watched
constantly from a visual observation post, and it. was noted }
that they never ato in the hotel restaurant but always in i
their rooms. It was also noted that the epparatus was i
placed under a pillow before they began to cat. While they :
were seated at the table having dinner, therefore, the KGB t
officers suddenly entercd the room and seized the equipment. H
in order to partially cover the illegality of this act, it
was decided to make a show of expelling BENSON, MULE and
STROUD from the Soviet Union, and this was done via the |
persona non grata action.

According to information from other sources, the equip-
ment was seized from BENSON, MULE, and STROUD on 5 May 1955,
and the three were declared persona non grata on 7 May (a
month before NOSENKO ciained to have transferred to the
Tourist Department).* When the 7 May date was given to
NOSENKO during the February 1965 interrogations, he replied
that the operation was handled at a higher level, that he : i

did not directly participate in it, but that he had been
involved in the earlier planning to seize the equipment. |
It was pointed out to him that he had always sald he was in
the Tourist Department at the time of this operation, and
that he had consistently said that he transferred from the
American to the Tourist Department in June 1955. NOSENKO
shrugged, but offered no comment.

{ix) CARDELLA

NOSENKO said that in 1954 and 1955 there was an admini-
strati officer in the Embassy hy the name of James CARDELLA.
The KGB had no interesting or unusual information concerning
CARDELLA from any source, and NOSENKO could say nothing more
about hin.

CIA files show that Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA served
in Moscow from September 1953 until June 1955. Other than the
fact that a microphone was discovered in CARDELLA's Moscow Em-
bassy office in 1964, no significant collateral information
concerning him is available.

(x) VAN _LARTHEN

NOSENKO identified George VAN LASTHEM as an Assistant Air

Attache the U.S. Embassy against whom an operation was at~
tempted in 1953 or 1954. le said that during this period a
Russian actress, Alla LARIONOVA, was placed on a train going
from Berlin to Moscow with the mission of striking up an acquain-
tance with VAN LAETHEM which could be followed up in Moscow.
She succeeded in meeting him end gave him her address: and tele-
phone: number. Although she was certain that she would hear from
him, he never did cali her in Moscow. NOSENKO said that he had
heard akout this fron P.F. IKRATCV, the case officer handling
LARIONOVA. He added that CHURANOVY was the case officer respon-
sible for VAN LAETHEM, as he was for all members of the Air At~-
tache's office at that KO knew of no other interest
or activity concerning VAN LABTHEM.

CIA records show that VAN LALTi: was not an Assistant Air
Attache but an Assistant Army Attache, serving in Moscow from
March 1951 to March 1953.* As cryptographic security officer
and officer in charg2 of the Embassy code room, he had super~
visory responsibility for the military code clerks and mechanics,
including Dayle SMITH, and he was on fairly close personal terms
with Sergeant Roy RHODES until the latter's departure from Mos-
cow in January 1953; VAN LAETHEM's duties also carried respon-
sibility for sensitive electronic activities in the Embassy.**
He was again in Mescow from 19 March to 19 Nay 1955 (at a time
when NOSENKO claims to have been the KGB case officer for U.S.
Army Attaches). Although this trip was always intended to be
only a TOY, it was represented to the Soviets as a PCS Assistant
Army Attache assignment because of the extrezely sensitive na-
ture of his’ business there. He was project officer for the en-
tire electronics program at the Embassy, and went to Moscow to
review the operations including the planned use of the new
electronic equipment which was seized from BENSON, MULE, and
STROUD in Stalingrad in May 1955 (see above).

¥—Kilthough VAN LAETHEM completed his two-year tour in Moscow in

March 1953, just at the time NOSENKO said he:entered the KGB,’

he was succeeded in his post by Walter MULE, for whom NOSENKO

has claimed full responsibility. Thus, the fact of his is

tion as Assistant. Army Attache_and MULE’s predecessor would
Bly be available to NOSENK

special electronic equipment -in the U.S. Embassy. RHODES had no

access to such information. i

D. June 1955 to January 1960 (Tourist Department)

1. Introduction

i By his account NOSENKO served in the American-Canadian--
British Section of the Tourist Department,* KGB Second Chief
Directorate, from June 1955 (shortly after. the department

* was created to operate with and against foreign travellers
in the USSR) until his transfer to another department in

& that directorate in January 1960. He was.a case officer

if until appointed Deputy Chief of the Section about June 1958.

Es In statezents made prior to April 1966, NOSENKO claimes to

have been twice promoted during this four and one-half year

period--to captain in July 1956 and to major in August or

September 1959--but in a signed statement of April 19€6 he

said he remained a captain from 1956 until his defection.

NOSENKO has described his personal and- direct partici-~ ‘
pation in the section's activities as consisting of:. i

{
-Recruitment of two Soviet. nationals as homosexual i
agents,** with NOSENKO their handler from the outset until H
they were dropped in 1962 or 1963. H
-Recruitment and handling of Soviets as agents tar-
getted against American tourists; their number varied from }
eight to 14 and many were employed by Inturist. H
~-Operations involving :4 foreigners who visited the \
USSR for various lengths of time.
-Recruitment and handling of the American Express Com- |

pany representative in Moscow, whom NOSENKO continued to
meet following his reassignment in January 1960.

-Decision in October 1959 that Lee Harvey OSWALD was
of no operational interest to the KGB, and subsequent par-
ticipation in the KGB investigation of OSWALD's activities
in the USSR. :

Each of these categories is discussed separately below.
2. “Soviet Homosexual Agents.

Because he had been seen meeting a foreigner in a

public lavatory in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded
“, that A.I. VOLKOV might be a homosexual and hence of some
operational value, The KGB therefore mounted an operation
which verified this possibility in 1957:. A homosexual agent
of the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department provoked ._
VOLKOV into a compromising ‘situation... Then VOLKOV, who had:
previously been a KGB agent but was at this time deactivated,
was called to KGB Headquarters where, after NOSENKO interro-
gated him, he admitted his homosexuality and agreed to

" *These components are also known as the First’ Section: and -
Seventh Department, respectively. as

**This tera refers to agents whose homosexuality is ex-
Ploited py the KGB against certain male targets.



NOSENKO’s proposal to work for the KGB among homosexuals.
YOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year to-recruit a hozo--
sexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronymic not. recalled)
YEFREMOV. The two agents sukcequently worked as a team
against foreigners under NOSENKO's direction; in addition
to specific targets, they had the general assignment of
associating with foreign visitors in Moscow for the pur-
pose of spotting possible homosexuals, NOSENKO described
on 12 June 1962 his use of these agents: “Although I am

a chief of section there I have all sorts of.agents. I
have a good agent apparatus. I have beautiful girls,
beautiful girls, whom I can use as I likv--anything you
want. I have homosexuals, pederasts, and, in particular, I
have one special pair. I am afraid they are known to both .

you and the British. I permitted this pair to work in ‘; 4
general [without specific assignments]. I send them. out to. i

look on their own. I give them money and tell them te go : }
out. ‘Stroll about. Here are theater tickets. ‘Look around, { 3
but only Americans. Look for American pederasts.' They are | !

& couple, that is, they love each other. They are able to

do anything desired, cither active or passive, anything.

They call me at night: ‘Yuriy Ivanovich. There is a mister i 4

so-and-so here. He wants to go to bed with us.'' I say: i i

‘Well, let him. We'll talk about it tomorrow.' So the next i i

day they go to a special hotel room. Wo make photographs. ! :

Then we think about what he represents. Is he worth it? j z

Then, as Chief, I recommend that he be recruited or not-- |

depending on his position, what he can give, what he can :

tell. If he can give something, I say: ‘Well, let's have a

ago figrat'|. After this, I speak to these boys: ‘Well, i 5

go to bed with him again, one or both of you, as you wish.

Do whatever is wanted,’ All this is seen [observed by the

KGB]. The [hotel] administrator enters. ‘What are you

doing?' The administrator calls the Militia. An akt is

drawn up. ‘Well, you are a foreigner. This is not our |

business. We don't know what to do with you.' Then the

Chief arrives: ‘What's up. Aha, I sce.' Well, then a con-

versation begins: ‘Listen, what shall we do? Pederasty is |

punishable by three to five years and now, on the basis of 5

recent legislation, by up to eight. Understand, if your 1 ' a
'

swutlabhle ana ca

friends find out that you are a pederast--and how can they
help but find out?..."

aah When NOSENKO moved from the Tourist Department to the

‘i . Second Chief Directorate's American Department in January

7 1960, he took VOLKOV and YEFREMOV with him. They were

ie never used against targets in the U.S. Embassy, but, NOSENKO ©
H . said, the Tourist Department “used to call me on homosexual

. prospects." VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued as active KGB .
mod ee agents until some time in 1960 or 1961, after which they iin betbecetaeas
could not be used further since they had become too well :
known, and NOSENKO finally retired their files to KGB
1 archives in 1962 or 1963.. The last operation in which these
two agents participated was. during January 1962.

During interrogation on these agents, NOSENKO has been rasa
unable to tell where they lived in Moscow, their family Meseceetecattie it
situation, or other such details. He said that he never 7
met either in a safehouse (always on the street) and never
met either of them enone without cine other being present.



109.

NOSENKO has described eleven KGB approaches to Americans
based on compromising evidence obtained with the assistance
of VOLKOV and/or YEFREMOV and several other cases in which
Americans. were suspected of being homosexuals

ion of these two. Additionally,|
at least. six Americans, not reported on by
> have had contacts with ‘one or both of these agents
in_ Moscow.

|

\ With one or possibly two exceptions, all
@ contacts of VOLKOV and YEFREMOV reported by NUSENKO.or
other sources took place during the period from April to 4
November 1959. The known exception was the KGB approach to i
W.E. JOHNSON in January 1962;* the possible exception was
the contact with the American psychiatrist, which took place {
in 1959 or early 1960 but cannot be dated precisely. Finally,
NOSENKO has described the contacts between VOLKOV, YEFREMOV, sae!
and the American Robert BARRETT in the summer of 1959 but
does not know of their contacts in the summer of 1961,
shortly before BARRETT was approached on the basis of com~
promising information obtained in 1959. ** ;

“3, Other Soviet Agents

The Tourist Department, just established when NOSENKO ' 4
was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent network for :
operations against American and British tourists. Conse-
quently, NOSENKO said, he and the other case officers had
to "start from the beginning:" 4

i

As a first step, NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow {
officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist; these
. were not agents, he explained, but "just persons Known to |
He the KGB so that a KGB man could approach one of them with
questions about somebody or something." NOSENKO began to
collect information on these individuals and others with the
aim of formalizing their recruitment; by the end of 1955,
he estimated, he had a network of about cight agents, all
oo of then Inturist interpreters. During the following four
years, the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied: |
Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another,
some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of changing |

all the time, back and forth." In 1956, NOSENKO said, he had
about ten agents, in 1957 there were about 12, in 1958 about .
eight, and at the end of 1959 (when he was preparing to return
to the American Department) he had approximately 12 to 14.
_NOSENKO has provided information on five of these agents,

all of whom he says he recruited from within Inturist during
1855. These were:

Larissa SOBOROVA: An-Inturist interpreter and.one of
the first Inturist agents recruited by. NOSENKO. - SOBOROVA : zi
was NOSENKO’S agent until 1959 (when she married and retired) 4
and reported to him on all foreigners with whom she worked as ot
an interpreter. She workéd with NOSENKO in the operation “oh

- Commonwealth Department in 1957 or the beginning of 1958.
In 1957 or 1959 she was involved in a sexual compromise
operation against an American professor, which did not
reach the point of a recruitment: approach, Between 1957
or 1958 and 1960 she was working against an American tourist
named Philip NIELSEN who was suspected of connection with
CIA and who was under study for recruitment. by the KGB.*
KUNGAROVA later married NIELSEN and the two ‘lived’ inn -+
England. The KGB was still interested in NIELSEN-at the
time NOSENKO left the Tourist Department, but NOSENKO be-
lieved there was no recruitment. Mrs. NIELSEN died in 1965,

Besides those in Inturist, NOSENKO has named several
other agents whom he reécrulted or was given while in the
Tourist Department. These included tha following:

-Aleksey A. DMITRIYEV: KGB cryptonym "TOMO," @ cane
didate member of the Academy of Sciences USSR and‘a special-
ist on Japan and Thailand. DMITRIYEV speaks Japanese and
English and worked at the Japanese exhibition in Moscow.
NOSENKO did not indicate how. DMITRIYEV was used cperationally
or how he was connected with the American-Canadian-British
target.

~(fnu) IVANOV: A lawyer employed by the Institute of
Foreign Trade in Moscow. NOSENKO did not personally re-
eruit this agent. IVANOV moved to Moscow from the Baltic
area and his previous handlers there notified the Center,
suggesting that the ugent might be of use in the capital.
NOSENKO contacted IVANOV and later turned him over to the
British Commonwealth Department of the Second Chief Direc-
torate whicn, NOSENKO believed, “planted him in the British
Trade Mission or something like that."

~Marina RYTOVA: KGB cryptonym "KRYMOVA," born about
1923 or 1924 and educated at the Military Institute of
Foreign Languages, a special school which also had Communist
students from foreign countries, There she studied military
subjects as well as foreign languages. She speaks English
and Greek well, NOSENKO could not recall who recruited her,
but she was turned over to him by I.A, KONSTANTINGV, a
Tourist Department case officer, in 1956 or 1957. At that
time she was working as an interpreter at the Russian 7
Permanent Exhibit in Moscow and continued in this job until
about 1960, when she became an instructor in the Greek
language school of the Institute of International. Relations.:.
She reported to NOSENKO any information which she obtained
on foreign delegates or foreign tourists who visited the
Exhibit in Moscow. As she was often invited by the Ministry
of Agriculture to interpret during meetings between Soviet
officials and delegates from America, England, ,and Greece,
she also reported. this information to NOSENKO. RYTOVA
served several times as an interpreter for KHRUSHCHEV and
once participated in a conversation he had with Iowa farmer i
GARST. In 1959 or 1960 she was sent. as interpreter with a
small delegation which visited GARST's farm in the United
, States and was used by the KGB Legal Residency in Washington,

avert - offices in Moscow and is a captain or a major. They have
. one daughter, approximately 14 years old. i

~Yevgeniya ("Jane") DANKO: KGB cryptonym “OKSANA.”
She. worked in the American Express Company office in Moscow
for Arsens FRIPPEL and later for FRIPPEL's successor,
Michael JELISAVCIC.* DANKO. was handled by I-A. KONSTANTINOV
from about 1955 to 1957.and was then turned over to NOSENKO.
She reported on JELISAVCIC, who was not approached, according
i to NOSENKO. :

4, Operations with Foreign Visitors
NOSENKO said he participated in 14 operations with |
foreign visitors to the USSR while a member of the American~
Canadian Section of.the Tourist Department. Nine of these
operations resulted in recruitments (excluding one who later
was recruited by another element of the KGB, but including
another whom NOSENKO classified as a borderline case). Of
the remaining five operations which did not end with a re- i, 3
cruitment, no approach was contemplated by the KGB in one i
case, one target rejected NOSENKO's proposal, the KGB was H
unable to obtain compromising material for an approach to a
third, and for political reasons the KGB decided against
approaching the final two. |

Although the information from NOSENKO on the timing of
these operations does not always agree with that from other
sources, these cases can be grouped chronologically as
follows: 1955 - one; 1956 ~ one; 1957 - three; 1958 - two;
and 1959 —- seven. The operations in 1955, 1956 and, with
one exception, 1959 were homosexual provocations. The re-

ve cruitment of Arsene FRIPPEL in 1959 was bascd on heterosexual

compromise.

was observed in contact with a Soviet citizen believed to :

be a homosexual. The Soviet was detained by the KGB, and
NOSENKO eventually obtained a.confession that he had had.
homosexual relations with MALIA, After. NOSENKO. had arranged -
for the Soviet to introduce MALIA to a KGB homosexual agent,
the latter enticed MALIA to a specially equipped hotel room

touch with MALIA) when the introductions were made in a

Moscow restaurant, and from an observation point in a
neigtboring hotel rooa he watched the KGB agent and MALIA
having relaticns. With MALIA insisting on the lights being
turned off, however, .1t was impossible to obtain compro
mising photcgraphs (the KGB did not yet have infra-red
photographic equipmont, NOSENKO said) and therefore no re=-
cruitment approach was made to MALIA. During this and a
later trip to Moscow in 1961, MALIA was “very cautious,"
and the KGB never again succeeded in exploiting MALIA's
homosexuality for a recruitment approach.

Investigation Results: MALIA, a U.S. Navy intelligence
officer during World Wer. 11, has visited the Soviet Union
in 1955 and twice in 1962. hile buying books for the
Library of Congress and. several universitics in 1955, MALIA
travelled over 10,000 miles throughout the USSR, which was
sufficiently unusual at the time to attract press publicity.
in 1955 and 1962 he had contacts with dissident Soviet
citizens and clandestinely brought to the est literature
for publishing abrord. In December 1963 MALIA was the
subject of an attack in the Soviet press which charged that

b. Recruitment of BURGI (1956)

NOSENKO's Information: At the first meeting in 1962
and despite his stated fear for his own security and his
determination to discuss only the txo leads he wished to sell
CIA, NOSENKO described his recruitment of Yate Professor
Richard BURGI on the basis of a homosexual provecation oper-
ation which began in Moscow and culminated with an approach
in Kiev in June 1953, NOSENKO reported that he received a
letter of commendation (blagodarnost') and a bonus of one
month's pay for this recriltwent, but in 1966 ne retracted
this claim. The BURGI case was the first operation in which
NOSENKO had direct contact with a foreign target of the KGB,
and NOSENKO said he counted it as a turning point in his
personal and professional life: It was with this success-
ful operation, NOSENKO stated, that he "began ‘to grow" from
@ spoiled playboy into a responsible and effective counter<
intelligence officer. The NUNGI operation was the first
recruitment carried out by the Tourist Department after it
was created in 1955, according to NOSENKO. In 1964 NOSENKO
reported for the first time that his, superior, A.S. KOZLOV,
Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, had also taken part
in this operation, but that he, NOSENKO, was .the ‘responsible.
case officer. In August 1965, when asked who had recruited
BURGI, NOSENKO’ replied: "KOZLOV and NOSENKO." Asked who
recruited him first, NOSENKO said: “KOZLOY, naturally, He
was the Deputy Chief of the Department. The collection of

_ the materials [in preparation for the approach} was in the

hands of €ase Officer NOSENKO." Because of the personal and
general significance ascribed to this operation by NOSENKO
it is discussed in detail here: core

In August 1965 NOSENKO reported that at the time of
BURGI's arrival in the USSR, his file contained a copy of
his visa application (anketa), “maybe” an excerpt from a \ 3
cable sent by the Soviet Embassy in the United States saying i i
that a visa had been granted, a routine note from Inturist :
giving BURGI's anticipated date of arrival and his itinerary |
inside the Soviet Union, and the results of traces of the '
general KGB Archives and of the First Chief Directorate |

I

archives. SENKO himself ran the traces, which proved to
be negative; there was no information on record concerning
BURGI, and since no other names were mentioned in the
naterial available on BURGI, no other traces were made. The
XGB interest in BURGI derived exclusively from the fact that 1
he was a professor of Slavic studies and therefure had con-
tect with students who might some day work for the U.S. |
State Department, American Intelligence, and other target

organizations. NOS) first suggested |

KO did not recall who f£
ap attcmpt to recruit him,

When BURGI arrived in the Soviet Union, he came in
contact witi a number of KGB agents, and their reports were '
placed in the unofficial file maintained by KOSENKO.* SO-

SENKXO could not recall in 1965 how many such agents there may ‘
have been, their names, or what they might have reported i i
concerning BURGI, (BURGE had en Inturist interpreter but j
KOSENKO did not know whether he was a@ KGB agent.) From some 1
source, name forgotten by NOSUNKO, the KGB obtained indica~
tions that BURGI was a homosexual, and it as decided to
try to obtain the grounds for recruitment by homosexual com= | :
promise. NOSENKO therefore approached Yu.A, LOPUKHOV, an i
officer of the Britis: Department who handled the homosexual
agent Viktor ANOYSKIY, and asked permission to use his
agent in setting up the compromis After permission had
been received to mount an operation on this basis, LOPUKHOV
end NOSENKO met with BELANOVSKIY and instructed him to make
BURGI's acquaintance in a hotel dining room. The compromise
proceeded according to plan: BELANOVSKIY mct BURGI, the
fect of mutual homosexuality was recognized, and BURGI was
invited to BELANOVSKIY's hotel room where homosexual acts
took place and photographs were made. NOSENKO was in the
adjoining room and directed the compromise. He did not mect
BURGI at this point, hoxever, H

As the result of NOSENKO's special request, the com- .
promising photographs were ready by the following day. A
report of the compromise and a request for permission to
attempt recruitment were then submitted to NOSENKO's superiors.
The request came back with the approving signatures of O.M.
GRIBANOV and A,S. FEKLISOV, the Chief of the American Depart.
ment of the First Chief Directorate, which had expressed
interest in using BURGI in the United States. BURGI's itin-
erary called for him to fly from Moscow to Kiev a short
while after this episode and, having called the Kiev KGB with
instructions, NOSENKO and KOZLOV flew there the day before to
prepare the operation. BURGI arrived the next morning and _
vas met at the airport by (fnu) KHODAKOVSKIY, an officer of
the Second Directorate in Kiev who operated under Inturist

!

In accordance with the operational plan, the local KGB
officer told BURGI enroute to the city that all the hotels
in Kiev were full at the moment because of various confer-
ences, but that Inturist had arranged for him to stay for
about a day in a private apartment in the center of town;
he would be moved to a hotel aS soon as possible. When the
car arrived at the apartment building on Kreshchetik Ulitsa
in Kiev, NOSENKO, KOZLOV, V.S. PETRENKO, a local KGB officer,
and (fnu) KASTYKAITE. a woman housekeeper, were waiting for
them. NOSENKO could not remember how or whether he intro-
duced himself to BURGI. The recruitment conversation, he
said, was handled by "KOZLOV-NOSENKO," but NOSENKO had for-
gotten by 1965 who said what: "I don't remember wnat I
talked about and I don't remember what KOZLOV talked about.
Many things were discussed. I[t started with how he liked
his stay jaithe Soviet Union... Then we slowly proceeded
to say how unfortunate it was that information had been re~
ceived about his conduct in Moscow. We told him that his
homosexual activities were known, that this was punishable
under Soviet lew according to article so-and-so of the
criminal code, ete., that he was not a diplomat, had no ;
diplomatic immunity, that he could be taken to court ac- :
cording to the Soviet law... Well, he was scared, confused,
upset, and felt uncomfortable. Then we slowly proceeded to
say that all that could be smoothed out, but, you understand, i i
the basis was prepared for the man to say: ‘All right, I :
agree to help.’ We showed him the pictures. He was i
embarrassed of course--he was naked. Then we prepared the j {
basis: 'You have a noble task, You teach; you have stu- |
dents; the students might become future specialists on ; :
Russia or might work as diplomats, etc., but many of these
students could be uscd by intelligence. They might be sent \
somewhere with special tasks. Maybe you will tell us who
among the students is preparing for government service,
how they are distributed, etc." During the first conver-
sation everything was made completely clear... He was not H
at all willing to help or work for Soviet Intelligence. He |
was told that he must understand that in this case ‘helping
Soviet Intelligence’ was a very broad term. I remember that :
I told him: ‘Understand, nobody is going to ask you that { :
you help our friends over there, or me, if I stiould be there, }
or that you do anything bad or conduct any kind of subver- {
sive activities, that you organize explosions or murder.’
After the Soviet Union, he was supposed to go to Italy, |
to visit the Russicum of the Vatican, and here KOZLOV
grabbed the subject and began to ask questions about this
school. He told us a bit about the Russicum and we asked
him to write about it and he wrote down some names of the

.. professors who teach Russian subjects..." According to
: NOSENKO, the discussion lasted about five hours; at its end.
BURGI signed 8 short statement that he agreed "to assist
the organs of Soviet Intelligence.” NOSENKO first said that
it was he who took this statement from BURGI but later said
he could not remember whether he or KOZLOV did this, BURGI
was then taken to a hotel.

In speaking of the 1959 U.S. Exhibiti Sokolniki
Park, Moscow, SHam@ told that both the
KGB and the GRU launched an fort to recruit
Americans employed at the Exhibition. All officers at GRU
Headquarters were assigned to this task, and some were used
by the KGB in an attempt to compromise the Americans;
V.A. GRUSHA (identificd by NOSENKO as a KGB officer special-
izing in American operations of the First Chief Directorat:
directed many of these KGB activities in which GRU ,person=
nel were involved. As a resuit of this endeavor, “more
than one American" was recruited, and QREE"SEEP indicated
that the technique of compromise--such as “bed pictures"--
was employed. When questioned on this subject

Shwe reported that to handle the Exhibition, the
CPSU Central Committee issued a special directive to form
a committee headed by the KGB (GRUSHA was in charge of cne
section of this committee) and to which the GRU

contributed personnel. Its purposes were twor

fold: protective, that is, to prevent propaganda, to dis-
rupt presentations, and‘ to conduct counterint,

tures of these activities through a two-way mirror, and the
confrontation with the militiamen who broke into the room.



39,

After returning to Geneva in 1964 and during subsequent
@ebriefings and interrogations, NOSENKO made the following
additional Statements concerning the FRIPPEL case:

~ Although he had personally recruited FRIPPEL, he
did not do so“élone; Col. V.0. CHELNOKOV, Deputy Chief
(and later Chief) of the Tourist Department, was present;
he and NCSENKO “carried out the recruitment together” in
early September’:1959, NOSENKO was, however, FRIPPEL's

case officer.

~ NOSENKO attricuted his involvement..in the PRIPPEL
recruitment to the following: "In 1952, after 1958,
when I became the Deputy Chief of the section, my area
of activity was narrowed down. I didn't handle all the
tourists at that time. I worke@ as the Deputy Chief of
the section and I had my own little area--for example, the
permanent representative of the Anerican ress Company,
and besides that I hegan to collect all the material on
all Amcrican tourist firms which have anything to do with
Inturist and who send tourists to the USSR."

~- FRIPPEL never provided any information of value to
Soviet tourist operations.

- When NOSENKO began to work in the U.S. Embassy
Section of the American Department in 1560, he took FRIPPEL
with him because FRIPPEL was acquainted with some Ameri-
cans at the Embassy. NOSENKO was asked to question FRIPPEL
about the U.S, Embassy and such Embassy officers as George
WINTERS and Lewis W. BOWDEN, but FRIPPEL never told NOSENKO
anything along this line.*

~ FRIPPEL provided no interesting information during
NOSENKO's two meeting’ with him in 1962 and 1963, when
FRIPPEL returned to the Soviet Union as a tour guide.

~ NOSENKO met “pretty steadily" with FRIPPEL during
the period to January 1961, and once NOSENKO and his wife,
in company with CHELNOKOV and his wife, had diriner at
FRIPPEL’?s home, where they met Mrs. FRIPPEL. Odette
FRIPPEL was unaware of her husband's status as a KGB agent,
and therefore NOSENKO and CHELNOKOV used Inturist cover
for their acquaintance with FRIPPEL. Although unusual for
KGB Second Chief Directorate case officers to visit agents
in their homes with wives present, NOSENKO explained that
he went because he "was invited,” and CHELNOKOV went "be-
cause he was also involved in the recruitment."

~ First as Deputy Chief of a section of the Tourist
Department and later as Deputy Chief and Acting Chief of
the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department,
NOSENKO continued to meet with FRIPPEL in Moscow hotels
and restaurants. Throughout this period, he was almost
invariably accompanied by CHELNOKOV: “Perhaps one time
I met with FRIPPEL alone, otherwise it was always with

CHELNOKOV." Usually NOSENKO would arrange these meetings
with FRIPPEL at CHELNOXOV's request and the two continued
to meet with FRIPPEL, despite his lack of production, be~
cause they “kept hoping he would give something.” In a

different context, but speaking of CHELNOKOV, NOSENKO ex-
plained: “You see, never-mind if you are a chief ora

@eputy chief of a department, you must have one, two, or
three agents. GRIBANOV insists, so that you don't forget
how to work. The Chiefs of the [Second Chief] Director-

ate do not demand that they have 22 or 13 agents, but they

must -have two or three. They will have important agents
or those in leading positions."

~_NOSENKO continued to act as FRIPEL's case officer
after FRIPPEL had left the Soviet Union and NOSENXO had
been transferred and promoted to the position of Deputy
Chief of the Tourist Department. He met twii with FRIP-
PEL during this latter period when FRIPPEL visited the
Soviet Union as a guide with groups of foréign visitors.
Both of these
out CHELNOKOV.

~ The first meeting took place in the summer of 1962,
after NOSENKO had returned to Moscow from Geneva. FRIPPEL
had arrived in the Soviet Union as a guide for some Ameri-
can journalists, (NOSENKO was unable to give the compo-
sition of the journalist group or to recail where they
stayed in Moscow and where else they travelled in the Sov-
iet Union.) NOSENKO contacted him in Moscow to learn what
questions the newsmen intended to ask KHRUSHCHEV during
a scheduled interview; subsequently NOSENKO acknowledged
that standard practice required visiting journalists to
submit their intended questions for KHRUSHCHEV in writing
to Soviet authorities prior to interviews. After the
interview, he recontacted FRIPPEL to learn the reaction
of the journalists to their talk with the Soviet leader.
NOSENKO could not recall their specific reaction to the
KHRUSHCHEV interview but did remember that they were
"satisfied." Another reason for contacting FRIPPEL,
NOSENKO added in a later discussion, was to learn whether
any of the journalists might hve joined the group at the
last moment in the United States, which might suggest
intelligence connections on their part.*

~ NOSENKO met. FRIPPEL alone for the second and last
time during March 1963. Since FRIPPEL was a guide for —~
tourists aboard the ship “Olympia,” which stopped for a
day in Yalta and Odessa, NOSENKO flew to Odessa from Mos-
cow and accosted FRIPPEL in the lobby of the hotel where
the tourists were having dinner, Finally able to get away

from his group, FRIPPEL called on NOSENKO in the latter's. =
hotel zoom, and the two draak and talked. NOSENKO had
given FRIPPEL a bottle of vodka as a gift, and FRIPPEL
faid he wanted to give NOSENKO some whiskey in return.
They drove in NOSENKO's car to the port, where NOSENKO
waited in the car while FRIPPEi, went aboard for the
whiskey. (He had invited NOSENKO to visit the ship but
could not obtain a pass for him.) When FRIPPEL returned.
he brought another American, so NUSENKO had to invent for
himself a suitable cover (laturist) on the spot. ‘The three
returned tc the hotel and Grank some more, everyone getting
_drunk, During this contact, FRIPPEL reported “nothing of
importance," ané his most interesting news was that he
might again Le reassigned to Hoscow in December 1963 as

the American Express Company representative.*

6. Lee Harvey OSWALD (1959-60: and 1963).

As in the FRIPPEL case, NOSENKO was involved with Lee
Harvey OSWALD during both periods of his assignment to the
Tourist Department of the Second Chief Directorate (1955-
1960 and 1962-1964).* While Deputy Chief @f the American-
British-Canadian Tourist Section, NOSENKO had a direct hind
in the decision in October 1959 that OSWALD was of no oper-
ational interest to the KGB And should be returned immediately
to the United States. Before President Kennedy's assassi- if
nation in November 1963, when NOSENKU was again in the
Tourist Department as its Deputy Chief, he was present-at the
time the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned of OSWALD's
application to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to re-enter.
the USSR. After the assassination, he also played a role in
the KGB investigations of OSWALD's activities during residence
in the Soviet Union from October 1959 until June 1902,

Collateral information relating to OSWALD's stay in the
Soviet Union, and particularly concerning any connections he
may have had with Soviet intelligence, is meager and indirect.
It derives almost entirely from indications ¢f primary
interest by the KGB (among all Soviet Government organs) in
every defector to the USSR, and from inferences which may be
drawn from certain entries in OSWALD's "ilistorical Diary" and
certain statements made by his wife, Marina, during inter-
views on behalf of the Warren Commission. After President
Kennedy's death, the Soviet Government provided the United
States with official documents and letters pertaining to
OSWALD's defection to the USSR, his suicide attempt, his
marriage, and other events inside the Soviet Union, This
information from the Soviet Government generally agrees with
the information from NOSENKO, The materials furnished by
the Soviet Government make no mention a2 any Soviet Intel-
ligence interest, or lack thereof, in OSWALD.

In this sense NOSENKO's information is unique: It was
and remains the only such information available on the 32
months of OSWALD's life in the USSR.** NOSENKO's access to

W—for continuity of presentation, both periods of NOSENKO's
alleged involvement, 1959-1960 and 1963, are discussed in

this part of the paper,

** Independent sources, however, reported on visits by OSWALD
to the soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico City between 29
September and 35 October 1963 and on his (apparently overt) con-

‘tact with a KGB officer under Consular cover at the Soviet om
“Embassy there, NOSENKO originally said he knew nothing of any

such contact. In October 1966 he revised this to say that

OSWALD did not have contact with the KGB in Mexico City. NOSENKO
explained that he had been sitting in the office of Tourist De-
partment Chief, K.N. DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head-
quarters from the KGB legal. Residency in Mexico. The cable,
which NOSENKO said he did not personally see, reported thet
OSWALD had visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City requesting
permission to return to the USSR and that he had dealt with
Soviet Foreign Ministry personnel only. :

b, Statements to CIA

On the basis cf the FBI interviews of NOSE
sinilar information which he had previously prov
further debricfings were conducted by C1A on 3 and
1964, New and explanatory infermation received during these
debriefings is presented below.

(i) KGB Interest in OSWALD. |
Until CSWALD mentioned to the Inturist guide his desire

to remain in the Sovict Union, he was treated routinely by i

the KCB. When OSWALD nice his request, this was reported

imaediately to the Tourist Department, and it was from this

moment that the KGB began to pay attention to hin, All

available materials on him were thereupon collected and i

examined--the visa application, Inturist reports, interpreters’ |

reports, reports frou hotel agents, aid the results of @

check of KGB Archives. KRUPNOV interviewed the interpreter

to whom OSWALD had stated his desire, Although the KGB con-

sidered it possible that OSWALD might be an American agent,

the KGB did nothing to investigate this possibility as "this

would be done after the person is allowed to stay in the

Soviet Union." Surveillance of OSWALD was not increased

after his request, and OSWALD was not intezviewed by the

KGB in an attempt to establish his intentions. There was

no attempt to debrief OSWALD because “he was not an inter-

esting person and wasn't normal." OSWALD wa'’s never questioned *

on his past nor asked to write an autobiography.** From the

®ROSERKO provided details on this point to CIN (see below) and
made a similar statement when asked in 1964 why KGB agent

Tamara KUNGAROVA had been permitted to marry en American (her own
developmental target) and then emigrate to England; See Part V.D.3.

ship on 31 October 1959, OSWALD toid the counsellor officer that
he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps and had told a
Soviet official that he would give the Soviets any information
concerning the.Marines and radar which he possessed.

materials and reports. immediately available it was decided
that something wes not quite normal about OSWALD, and the
_KGB therefore had Inturist.tell him that he would have to ~
5 “ leave the USSR when ais visa expired, . OSWALD's suicide
attempt supported the Tourist Department's feelirg that
it had been right in deciding to refuse OSWALD's request ee
for citizenship, particularly as the hospital also re-

ported that he was not normal, and the Tourist Department
decided: "We will do nothing; we don't want to know hin."
Inturist was suusequently tol There is no KGB interest
Tn him. Do what you want'... The KGB thought that he was
of no interest for the country or for the KGB, that he was
not normal, and that he should leave the country." The
Tourist Department and the KGB in genera] thereupon “washed
their hands" of this matter.

There was never any operational use of OSWALD nor was

there anything in OSWALD's file to indicate that the KGB
f attempted to debrief him on his past service in the U.S.
Marine Corps or other matters; this was because “he is a
very little person and also it is felt that he is not nor-
mal, so the KGB is afraid to do this with him."* The GRU
was not informed of OSWALD's defection, Neither was any
attempt made to exploit OSWALD for propaganda purposes
in Moscow or in Minsk. In short, there was no intelligence i
interest or contact with OSWALD after the initial assess-
ment of abnormality.

(ii) KGB Interest in Marina OSWALD —

The KGB had no knowledge or interest in Marina (nee
PRUSAKOVA) until she and OSWALD applied for permission to
register marriage. In fact the KGB did not know that she
was a friend of OSWALD until this point, for there was no
surveillance on OSWALD to show that he knew her. When the
KGB learned of their relationship, checks were made of the
Archives of the Minsk KGB as well as neighborhood checks and
checks at her place of employment. The people where she
lived and worked and went to school considered her a simple
girl, not very clever, only fair in her studies, not an active
member of the KOMSOMOL. She was a simple “philistine,” an Hi
uncultured girl more interested in gossip than in anything
important, The KGB never considered recruiting her as an
informant on-OSWALD “because it was considered dangerous to
recruit a wife to report on her husband," Nor was it con-
sidered to recruit her for use after she arrived in the
United States, "because she would tell him and also she
would probably tell the Americans, based on the assessment
of the type of person she was." 3

ae “"(id) OSWALD's Marriage and Departure from the USSR -

7 NOSENKO was asked why there were so few difficulties
in the way of Marina's marriage to a foreigner and her
departure from the Soviet Union. lie replied: “"The Soviet
law allows any Soviet citizen to marry a foreigner. It was

OSWALD as fear of becoming involved with an unstable -per-
son.

easy in this case because OSWALD was already living and

working in the Soviet Union. It would be pore difficult,
of course, with tourists or others who are in the Soviet
Union only for a short period and want to marry Soviet
citizens."* ‘Asked whether it is not unususliy difficult
for Soviet citizens to leave the Soviet Union, NOSENKO
explained: "In this. case it was easier because Marina
was already married to a foreigner.” NOSENKO was fext
asked what’ Office or level of the Government or Party
must make the final decision Yegarding Marina’s marriage
to OSKALD. He described the procedure as follows: "They
would come to the Regional Registration Office to apply
to register their marriage, {There} they will be told
that they will have to wait a week or two: wh ile’ they think
it over to be sure they want to: get marriec, During this
period the necessary checks are conducted. The Regional
Office would call the Militia, and the Militia would call
the Minsk KGB, The Minsk KGB said that it is all right
for them to get married--that the KGB has no objection,
But it is the law that allows them to be married, There
are no formal approvals necessary." -

Concerning the decision to permit the couple to leave
the USSR, NOSENKO said on 3 July 1964 that the decision
would be made cn the local level, in Minsk, and that there :
is no need to check in Moscow. On 27 July 1964 he corrected ;
this statement to say that, while local authorities make :
the decision, it must be approved in Moscow by, he thought, ;
the MInistry for the Preservation of Public Order (MOOP). i

(iv) QSWALD's Visit to Soviet Enbassy lexico

Asked whether he had any information on OSWALD's visit
to ‘':xico in September 1963, NOSENKO said that he knew oniy
that OSWALD had applied at the Soviet Embassy there to come
to the Soviet Union. The Mexico €ity Legal Residency of the
KGB reported his visit to Headquarters by cable, requesting
inforr:*ion; this was the first that the KG3 First Chief
Directorate had heard of CSWALD. M.I. TURALIN, Deputy Chief
of Service Number Two (KGB counterintelligence abroad),
thereupon phoned V,K, ALLKSEYEV, Chief of the Sixth Section
of the Tourist Department, whom TURALIN knew personally, to
learn whether any information was available. NOSENKO believed
that ALEKSEYEV then came to V.D. CHELNOKOV or A.G. KOVALENKO
te. ask about OSWALD, and NOSENKO thought that he himself was
present at the time, ALEKSEYEV was given the background on

‘ OSWALD, including his suicide attempt and the fact that he
was not considered normal, and was told to advise the First |
Chief Directorate that OSWALD should not be permitted to re-
enter the Soviet Union, ALEKSEYEV then telephoned TURALIN
to relay this message. NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD

(v) NOSENKO*s Comments on’ Possible KGB Involverent in the
Assassination = ae rari
When first discussing the OSWALD case with NOSENKO on 23
January 1964, a CIA case officer commented: “It is a very un-
fortunate thing that these prior events occurred in the Soviet
Union." (NOSENKO apparently misunderstood the case officer's
intent, which was not to imply that the KGB was behind the
assassination, ly that tho fact of OSWALD's. “defection

even sent several workers down there to investigate--not

to make a complete investigation on ny end of things because
this is @ serious matter when the head of a government is

advantage to the Soviet Union :f the President were still
Kennedy because he was a personage who was a realist and locked
at many things in the eye boldly. In the history of any
intelligence service there have been assassinations of one
kind or another, I can say this: That in our organization,
not even speaking of myself, many persons were shocked by
the assassination--to think that this should happen in the
twentieth century and in, of all places, the most powerful
. government in the world,”



Information from NOSENKO

In June 1958 there was a reorganization within the Tourist — ;°

Department of the Second Chief Directorate, The Second Section,

.which had theretofore concerned itself with operational. activity

against foreign tourists from all countries, was broken down into
separate sections; one section.dealt with tourists from the United
States, Canada, and Great Britain, the other with tourists from
Europe, Latin America, and all other countries. NOSENKO said
that he was promoted at this time to the position of Deputy Chief
of the first of these new sections.

NOSENKO's involvement in at least one major case, Lee Harvey
OSWALD, stems entirely from his having held this position. It
is also on this basis that he was able to claim awareness of all
recruitments from among American tourists from mid-1958- until he
returned to the American Department at the beginning of 1960.
His knowledge about recruitments is based additionally, he said,
on the fact that some time between May and October 1959, during
the tourist season, he was ordered by Ye. S$. KIRPICHNIKOV,
GRIBANOV's secretary, to gather facts for GRIBANOV concerning the
use of tourist cover by foreign intelligence organizations during
the périod from 1955 through 1958. NOSENKO gathered this material
from earlier annua! reports of the Tourist Department: ated by talk-
bare with various case officers in the department. *

On the basis of his general and supervisory experience in
the Tourist Department as well as his research for this paper,
NOSENKO had the following to say about Tourist Department opera-
tions pricr to 1960 (taken from the protocol he signed on this
subject on 25 February 1965):

“Operations against tourists were developing slowly
during this period and very Little was known by the KGB
about the use of tourism by American Intelligence at the
time I wrote the report in 1959. No agents were definitely
uncovered among American tourists during the years 1958 or
1959 and, until 1960, no tourists were ‘caught in the act’
of mailing letters, servicing deaddrops or contacting
agents, except one whose name I remember as McGUIRE. I do

¥ Questioned on this paper in February 1965,.NOSENKO said he

did not remember whether he discussed it with GRIBANOV, nor
could he recall any examples of the material he included in
it, what the paper said about ‘CIA tourist operations, or |what
other U.S. Intelligence organizations were using tourism as
-an operational cover in this period. He did remember, how-
ever, that it incorporated statistical data on the growth

of foreign tourism.

not. know any details concerning the operational activity
which led to the discovery of MCGUIRE's letter mailing.*

"I know of no case in which an American tourist was
definitely uncovered as an agent of American Intelligence
and thereafter approached for recruitment by the KGB during
this period.

"I do not know of any such American tourists who were
CIA agents, and who were recruited by the KGB during this
period.

“In addition to McGUIRE, the Seventh Department de-
veloped suspicions concerning a number of tourists, but
didn't learn of any specific intelligence connections.
Some were taking pictures, others were disseminating
literature. Although various operational measures were
taken acainst them, including vyemka (covert baggage
search) end the use of KGS agents, none of these tourists
received real operational development.

Know

During the first week of June 1959, a three-day meeting was
held in London, England, between representatives of CIA and the
British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, commonly referred to as
MI-6) on the subject of “legal-cravel” intelligence operations
against the USSR, At the conciusion of this meeting there was
drawn up a 19 page document summarizing shat had been discussed
at the meetings. This summary spelied out CIA operational doc-
trine pertaining to tourist operazions, including agent-spotting
techniques, criteria for agent seiection, agent assessment, agent
training, and tasks to be carried out by tourist agents during
the coming (1959) tourist season. It stressed CIA's reliance
on tourists for the spotting, recontacting, assessing, and
communicating with clandestine assets in the Soviet Union. A
copy of the document as well, presumably,as other British docu-
ments relating to the joint meetings was given to George BLAKE,
who has admitted having made a photographic copy which he passed
to the KGB. He gave the KGB this information in the summer of
1959.

* One Robert Alan MCGUIRE, a former. staff empioyce of CIA,
travelled to the Soviet Union as a tourist during April and~
May 1958. Although he was debriefed on his return, he had
no connection with CIA in preparation for this trip and
mailed no letters for CIA inside the USSR. While in the
Soviet Union, McGUIRE was approached on numerous occasions
by Soviets seeking blackmarket deals., American girls, and
assistance in defecting to the Americans. While en route to
Leningrad, his brief case was overtly searched by a customs
employee, who confiscated a Radio Liberation script. McGUIRE
reported that he was compelled to sign a document which stated
that the script had been confiscated, but the reasons for the
action were left blank. NOSENKO. who has reported none of
these details, appears to have confused MCGUIRE with Edward

JAN, a CIA agent who mailed a letter in Minsk in August
1958 and was detected doing so by the KGB; NOSENKO said
MCGUIRE mailed a letter in Minsk in 1959... t

McGOWAN had female companionship for the remainder of his visit.**

The document from GOLITSYN also states: "SIMARD, Lionel,

est towards military literature of the USSR; he made contact
with Soviet citizens and attempted to slip into the area of ship- ¢

against American tourists in 1959 when he was assigned as

On one occasion, when,,this o}

ARTEMOV had escorted him, he caught ARTEMOV searching his

ARTEMOV, which took place at the time he said he was Deputy
Chief of the section dealing with American tourists. In
October 1966, in answer to a specific question, NOSENKO stated
that ARTEMOV never had any connection. with the American Section
of the Tourist Department.

The KG8 document elsewhere states: "A guide of a.tourist
group, John Milton FRANCIS, born 1934, an instructor of Russian
at a college of Yale University; when in Odessa with a group of
tourists-~Anerican students~-separated himself from the group
and travelled through the city alone. In a notebook which was
lost by him, notes and sketches were found which pointed to the
fact that hw utilized his trip. for the purpose of selecting
suitable places for the placing of deaddrops, or for checking
those deaddrops which were earlier selected by American agents.
In Moscow he selected routes which were used. to check and dis-
discover the existence of surveillance, utilizing passable backyards.
and following skillful methods. At the present time FRANCIS is
the chief interpreter of the State.Department, servicing Soviet
delegations in the USA."

FRANCIS did have such a mission in 1958 and brought back a
notebock with sketches of the sites he selected. He did not
mention losing his notebook. In 1954 ard 1955 FRANCIS was in
frequent contact with V.V. KRIVOSHEY in Perlin; KRIVOSHEY, who
served there until the late 1950's, has been identified as a KGB
Pirst Chief Directorate officer who later became an officer in
the Correspondents Department, KGB. Second Chief Directorate.*
FRANCIS was also a student of Richard BURGI at Yale in 1956, the
year that NOSENKO was involved in BURGI's recruitment (see Part
V.D.4.b.). NOSENKO has not mentioned the FRANCIS case and did
not recognize his name.

¥~RRIVOSHEY was a participant in the Sgt. Robert Lee JOHNSON
case to which NOSENKO provided the, lead. (see Part VI.D.3.c.).

E, January 1960 to January 1962 (American Department)

1. Introduction

NOSENKO claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the U.S.
Embassy Section of the American Départment, GB Second Chief
Directorate, from sometime in January 1960 until the first days
of January 1962.* This section, in his. words, was working ©
against "the most important counterintelligence target in the
Soviet Union," the permanent Anerican representation in Moscow.
It regarded every American stationed there as a possible spy
and, simultaneously, as a target for eventual compromise and
recruitment,

The functions of the U.S. Embassy Section were described by
NOSENKO as being, first, to control all contacts by Embassy per-
sonnel with Soviet citizens; second, to evaluate information
collected from all possible sources on American Embassy employees;
and third,. to use this information as a basis for planning and
carrying out recruitment approaches. The Anericans' personal-
ities, jobs, personal relationships, weaknesses, daily routines,
security precautions, contacts with Soviet citizens, and the
major and minor scandals ‘in their Moscow lives formed the basis
for this work. To gather such information, the section's officers
directed and debriefed large numbers of agents and informants,
including the indigenous employees of the Embassy, Soviet citizens
moving in Embassy social circles, and third-country nationals with
American contacts; the officers also assigned tasks to and assim-
dilated the reports from the numerous surveillance teams at their
disposal, and they read and tried to exploit materials from tele-
phone taps and microphones placed in the offices and homes of
the Americens. Each officer had a limited number of American

~Sargets and attempted to become thoroughly familiar with :achr

annually, they submitted detailed operational plans to exploit
the knowledge they had gained of their target. During 1960 and
1961, NOSENKO said, special emphasis was placed within the section
on “identifying intelligence officers at the Embassy and active
development of them, the acquisition of ciphers, and the detailed
and painstaking study of code clerks, creating the conditions on
the basis of which they can be recruited."

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO has said, he had
access to all information concerning its activities: "Nothing
was hidden” from him. On this basis, he expressed certainty
that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB did not recruit any Americans
associated with the Embassy, that no Americans assigned to the
Embassy were being handled in Moscow as KGB agents in this
period, and that, in fact, the KGB had recruited no American
Embassy personnel since "ANDREY.“** From continuing friendships
with his fellow-officers of 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO has also
claimed certainty that there were no KGB recruitments from the
time he left the section in January 1962 until the January 1964
trip to Geneva.

* In debriefing and interrogating NOSENKO, CIA placed partic-
ular emphasis on his activities during the period January

1960 to January 1962, since this information was of special

importance to U.S. Government security.

See Part VI.D.3.b. fora discussion of the case of the KGB
: agent "ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH), whose recruitment ‘has been
wariously dated by NOSENKO between the years 1949 and 1953.

meanwhile. "no one replaced NOSENKO’ Us Deputy" CHrel-oF the
Tourist Department's American Section because (as he explained’ ~~
‘on 29 January 1965) the Tourist Department, which had earlier.
operated against members of delegations and various other
categories of foreign visitors, was being reorganized in January.
1960 for work against tourists alone and the Deputy Chief slot.
was eliminated.* With the exception of A. A. DMITRIYEV, Marina
RYTOVA, and the homosexuals YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, NOSENKO turned
ever all of his agents to another officer in the section named
TIMOFEYEV. NOSENKO said on 29 January 1965 that he had two
separate files on his agent Arsene FRIPPEL, @ developmental file
and an operational file, and. that he turned the former over to
TIMOFEYEV. and the latter to V. D. CHELNOKOV, Deputy Chief of the
Tourist Department. During later..interrogations, however, NOSENKO
has said that he continued to handle FRIPPEL while in the U.S.
Embassy Section and was the case officer during FRIPPEL's visits
to the Soviet Union in 1962 and 1963.**

2.  NOSENKO's Transfer to the U.S. Embassy Section

In December 1959, while serving as Deputy Chief of the
American-Britisn-Canadian Section of the Tourist Department,
NOSENKO learned from K. N. DUBAS, the department Chief, of plans
to transfer him to the U.S. Embassy Section as Deputy Chief.
NOSENKO said he was opposed to the move and wanted to remain in
the Tourist Department: "I was used to it there and wanted to
continue, I wanted to stay in the Tourist Department. This
Zthe transfer/ was no promotion. Here I was the Deputy Chief
Of section and would be the same there. But, of course, its more
important there. The American Department is, of course, the most
important. But here I was working against American tourists.
This is also important. Furthermore, I showed /had proven/ my-
self there in '55, '56, ‘57, ‘58, and ‘59 and was considered to
be not a bed case officer. And here, in the American Department,
I must show /prove/ myself with new people." NOSENKO therefore
asked DUBAS in December 1959 to "please fight for me to stay."
DUBAS later told NOSENKO that he had twice spoken to Second
Chief Directorate Chief 0. M. GRIBANOV on his behalf, but to
no avail. iIn January 1960 the official orders transferring ©
NOSENKO were issued. .

On the day NOSENKO reported to V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the
American Department, to begin his new job, he was told to report
to GRIBANOV's office. To GRIBANOV NOSENKO again expressed mis~
givings about the change of assignment. GRIBANOV replied that
DUBAS had spoken to him about this but that he, GRIBANOV, “had
his own plans and that was all." GRIBANOV told NOSENKO that

* There was no change in the functions of NOSENKO's section,
however; as before, it continued to be responsible for
operations against tourists from the United States,
England, and Canada.

** PRIPPEL has reported that NOSENKO:continued to meet him
until he left the Soviet Union. in January 1961 and again
when he returned as a guide to tourist groups twice in
1962 and once again in 1963; see Part V.D.5.

he thought NOSENKO could bring “fresh air" to the U.S. Embassy
Section's operations and that he was to pay particular attention
to operations against American code clerks, the “number one
target."* Neither GRIBANOV nor KLYPIN told NOSEXKO why he had
been selected. for this position.or who had recommended him for
it.

NOSENKO was asked on 17 April 1964 «hom he had relieved
upon reporting for duty in the U.S. Embassy Section. He replied:
"Nobody." He was then asked to identify the persons from whom
he had assumed certain of his duties as Deputy Chief of the
section (these are ciscussed in detail below), NOSENKO said that
he took the responsibility for maintaining the section file on
the security of the U.S. Embassy from the Chief of the section,
Vv. M. KOVSHUK,** Regarding his responsibility as case officer for
the Security Officer of the Embassy, NOSENKO explained that be-
cause former Security Officer Russell LANGELLE had been declared
persona non grata in OctoLer 1959 and because his successor John
ABIDIAN was not to arrive until March 1960, no one in the section
had this responsibility wher he, NOSENKO, arrived in January 1
1960. Asked who had been LAIGELLE's case officer, NOSENKO re-
plied: “LANGELLZ was handled by several people - by /A.S./ MALYU- Hl
GIN, then after that by /V.A,/ KUSKOV, then by KOVSHUK, then

* In late December 1961, GOLITSYN also commented on this subject
to his CIA handling officer: "The task of strengthening of
wor: against the Americans has been a standing requirement, Hee -
both in the past and most particularly at this time. This Cc
work was particularly intensified after the appointment of
SHELEPIN to the KGB... In 1960, it was recommended in the
KGB to intensify the work against the Americans at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow, and against American colonies in other
countries... This question of intensifying work against the
Americans was up before the Collegium of the KGB. Thereafter,
there was a directive from SHELEPIN regarding the intensifi-
cation of work against the Anerican cipher-clerks."

tion iff 1960 and information earlier supplied by aaa ;
GOLITSYN told CIA of a conversation he had with KOVSHUK in H
January 1961 in Moscow (see Part V.E.3:c.2. concerning a. a
recruitment approach to the American code clerk James STORS- 4
BERG) but at that time described KOVSHUK only as an American i
Department officer, without indicating his position. The oka pee nafs
only time that GCLITSYN has given a position for KOVSHUK was 1
in the context of questioning concerning KHRUSHCHEV's "Secret
Speech" denouncing STALIN in 1956; ,GOLITSYN: said that ac this
time KOVSHUK was Chief of the American Department (sic) of
the Second Chief Directorate, On 16 February 1962 GOLITSYN
identified Vladimir PETROV as-Chief of the “section concerned
with the American Embassy of the American Department of the
Second Directorate® in 1960,, NOSENKO had identified PETROV
) as Chief of the Second Section of the American Department,
which was concerned with the penetration of U.S. intelligence
operations inside the Soviet Union.



Pin. "Yes: LAN was ‘ore my time. © tuo months” laters™
on 24 June 1964, NOSENKO stated: "In 1959 and. possibly in 195:
Mikhail Fedorovich BAKHVALOV was the Deputy Chief of ‘the U.S.
Embassy Section. I replaced him in this position in 1960 and
he went to the Fifth (Eastern Countries) Department as Deputy
Chief."* On 8 September 1964 NOSENKO volunteered for. the first siaeae z
time that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief of the. section, had been : fe 3
the case officer for LANGELLE. Under interrogation in early i
1965, NOSENKO added’.that BAKHVALOV had 2lso been responsible for 4
maintaining the file on the security of the U.S. Embassy. At faut
this time he explained his earlier statement by saying that BAKH- *
VALOV had left the section before his arrival and had given the :
file to KOVSHUK to hold for his successor. The file continued to
be charged officially to BAKHVALOV, however, even though he. was
no longer in the section, and NOSENKC arranged for the official
change of custody shortly after reporting for duty (see Part V.E.
3.€.). NOSENKO said further, in January 1965, that BAKHVALOV
had shared responsibility for supervising code clerk operetions
with KOVSHUK before NOSENKO arrived to assume these duties him=
self, NOSENKO had been given a number of opportunities prior
to 24 June 1964 to identify BAKHVALOV as his predecessor, but
he did not do so, These are summarized below:

25 January 1964: In a discussion of the Fifth (Eastern
Countries) Department of the Second Chief Directorate. NOSENKO i
said: “the Chief of this department is Colonel Artem DAVIDYAN, a
He is an Armenian. His Deputy is Colonel Nikhail BAKHVALOV." a

27 February 1964: NOSENKO was shown a photograph of V.A.
ALEKSEYEV, a Soviet who was in Japan from July to September-
1961 as a member of a trade delegation, NOSENKO immediately
recognized the face as that of the Deputy Chief cf the Fifth
Department of the Second Chief Directorate, He said that he
@id not know this person's last name, but that his first name
and patronymic were Mikhail Fedorovich. when shown the last
name ALEKSEYEV, NOSENKO recognized it as an alias, but pro-
vided no further information concerning his true identity or
earlier service in the American Department.

10 June 1964: NOSENKO was asked to list in writing the
names of KGB officers who had received various ewards for
their service. He wrote: "The following got either the
Order of the Military Red Banner or the Order of the Red Star,
I'm not sure which: Mikhail BAKHVALOV, Deputy Chief of a
section in an unremembered department of the Second Chief
Directorate."

18 June 1964: NOSENKO was asked to list all the
officers who had been assigned-to- the American Department i
for’ each year since he joined the KGB, He named the chiefs
and deputies of the U.S. Embassy Section from 1953 through 7
1956. When he came to 1957, however, he said that he could Fatsotes

not describe their functions. On this basis. NOSENKO was then
asked to list the officers who had joined the section between
1956 and January.1960, when NOSENKO said he had returned. He
provided 14 names, but BAKHVALOV's was not among them. Asked

. to name the officers who had left the section in the same period,

Duties and Knowledgeability

Shortly after Eaaareine for dues in the U.S. ‘Ehbassy ~
Section and following his. short discussion. with GRIBANOV,
NOSENKO met with Department Chief KLYPIN and. Section Chief
KOVSHUK to discuss his responsibilities and functions in
the section. Repeating what GRIBANOV had already said, 3
KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's most important single respon-
sibility in the section would be supervision. of all KGB
Lane operational activity against American military and State

Department code clerks stationed in Moscow. As for the i
other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN suggested a division 7
of labor under which KOVSHUK would be responsible for super-
vising operations against State Department personnel and
NOSENKO would Supervise work against he Army, Air Force,
and Naval attaches and their assistants.* NOSENKO was also
made respnnsible for maintaining certain files in the section.
On 19 February 1965 NOSENKO signed an interrogation proto-
col which he agreed contained a listing of his principal -
responsibilities during 1960 and 1961. It read in part:

"During' the eR tire Patece in tke First [U.S.

b. Functions as General Deputy and Acting Chief of Section .

1) Access

Since his defection NOSENKO has maintained under re-
peated interrogation that as general deputy to KOVSIIUK, with
the responsibility of taking over in’ KOYSHUK's absence, he
had acces. to all information on the section's activities
and was obliged to keep current. on this information. On
this basis he has been able to assure his questioners that
the KGB was completely unsuccessful in its attempts to re-
cruit Americans assigned to the Embassy in these two years.
NOSENKO has also said at various times that his access to
section files and his discussions with section officers made
it certain that there were also no successes fron 1953 to i
1960 and from January 1962 to January 1964. His statements
‘on this subject during the Februgry 1965 were distilled in
a thai which NOSENKO signed on 20 February (quoted in
full):

tions was to serve as KOVSKUK's general deputy and to 4

(ii) Duties

On 29 January 1965, NOSENKO was questioned concerning
his supervisory duties as Deputy Chief of the section, par-
ticularly his function of supervising activity against code
clerks. The transcript of this discussion is quoted here:

Question: To which of the major responsibilities you have
mentioned did you have to devote the most time?

Answer: I don't know. } i
Q@ What was the most important? 4
A: Everything was important. i
Q@: _ Whom did you supervise in the American Embassy

Section? i
Al GRYAZNOV, KOSOLAPOV, [Vladimir] DEMKIN, and later i

[¥evgeniy] GROMAKOVSKIY who worked with DENKIN.
Then there was [N.A.] GAVRILENKO, [I.¥a.] KURI- ;
LENKO; and BELOGLAZOV: working with the Attaches. i {

Q: They were all in the First Section? 4
A: Yes. Py i
@: What were their responsibilities? 1 j
A: GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV had all the code clerks. |

DEMKIN was charged with all persons living in ’
America House, except code clerks. GROMAKOVSKIY
helped him. GAVRILENKXO had the Air Force Attaches
and [their] assistants, and also he had the plane
of the Ambassador. He must think about watching
the pilots who were living in a hotel. KURILENKO--
Army Attache and assistants; BELOGLAZOV--Navy
Attache, assistants, and Marines.

word ‘"supervisor"?, i

It might be necessary to go to meet her. But, we
knew how Inga was afraid of intelligence. And,
you see, they don't like it when a new case offi-
cer appears. But, maybe, for the sake of the file,

it was necessary to go, to hear her. Not because
you do not believe GRYAZNOV, No. But, you see,
to hear from the source | emphasized], directly,
what is going on, and how it is going on, to get
a feeling. Because the source will tell the case-
officer, then the case officer will tell you.
Maybe sometimes he will not give you every detail,
every intonation. But in some cases, it is neces-
sary to feel this. But, of course, it depends on
the agent, on the target, whether you will go or
not go. It's very difficult, again, to say.

Q: Could you say that you met 50 per cent of the
section's agents?

A: No, I can't say. é

Q: Fifty per cent or 75 per cent?

A: I can't answer you.

Q: What about your functions as a supervisor in re-

gard to satehouses, to "K.K.'s" and "Ya.K.'s",*

A: Oh. I myself had a file on my flat, a yavochnaya
kvartira, which I brought from the Seven
[Tourist Department]. It was my own. GRYAZNOV
had his own yavochnaya kvartira. KOSOLAPOV had
also his own yavochnaya Kvartira. And not one of
us had a conspirative apartment.

Q: And you took the "Ya.K." from...

A: (Interrupting.) Which I had from the Seventh.
And, by the way, when I was leaving the First
[American] Department, 1 took this file again
to the Seventh.

Q: And not one of you had a conspirative flat.

A: No, because the section had only--how many?--
{P.1.] MASSYA bad one conspirative. [V.P.]
FEDYANIN had one conspirative, and then there was
one conspirative flat, where, in fact, an agent
was living. In the First Section there were
three or four conspirative flats.

QQ: But among you, GRYAZNOV, and KOSOLAPOV there was
none?

A: Only "Ya.K.'s". :

*A "K.K." (konspirativnaya kvartira--conspiratorial apart-

ment) is de¥ined by NOSENKO as a Safehouse ‘or apartment: owned
and maintained by the KGB. A "Ya.K." (yavochnaya kvartira--

is perhaps subsidized-by the KGB and absents himself when

And you didn't have any responsibility for super-

I don't understand.

Was there some central control of the use of the
"Ya.K, 's"?

What kind of control?

Who would be using them, when they would be using
them, under what conditions?

No. The case officer who was working with it
decides how to use this flat or how not to use fH
it, et cetera, et cetera, Besides that, very 4
often we were using rooms in hotels.

So GRYAZNOV would take any of his operational
activity to his "Ya.K."?

He would also mect with his agents, with his i
operational contacts in hotel rooms. KOSOLAPOV

was meeting his agents in his own "Ya.K."; NO-

SENKO was meeting his agents or operational con-

tacts in his own "Ya.K.".

Could GRYAZNOV or KOSOLAPOV ever’ use these "Ya.K. 's"
without your knowing about it?

Of course. It's their own flat. + Soeteeestcansoassenssacirtonecne®

But you're supervising their work?

.Must I keep them like a little, little child?
No,'no. They don't have to report to me: "Today
I go to meet my agent at my flat."

They can use them whenever they like without checking
with you as supervisor? .

Of course, of course. They are meeting their own
agents. :



. You have no idea who: they are eoting,
theyare meeting them? pea

When: they are mevting an active development agent,
they tell me afterwards. They are telling “this,
this, this, this" and I am answering "this, this,
this." But usually they are going to meet maids
or they don't have to report. There is nothing
active and there is....The file is going on.

Q: ++ What about operational vehicles? Automobiles?

AS You see, we tiad one automobile for the whole
department. Besides this, we could apply, when
necessary, to the officer on duty for the Second
Chief Directorate and he would give a car, be~ -
ceuse he has a number of cars at his disposal.

Q: Approximately how mach of your time did you spend
supervising GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV?,

A: I can't say.

Q: Was it the most important function?

As Yes, it was important. Ail work in the First

Section was important. This was the most impor-
tant. But one day I could devote the whole day
to code clerks, the next day maybe half the day,
maybe two hours in the day. The rest of the day
I will be absent. I will be meeting with KLYPIN,
or I will be having a meeting with surveillance,
or I will be at ancther place. The third day,
again, maybe the whole day, maybe part of it.
No, I can't tell you. It depends on the situa~
tion.

(411) Additional Duties in KOVSHUK's Absence
As Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, one of

NOSENKO's responsibilities was to serve as Acting Chief
when KOVSHUK was absent from the office. NOSENKO recalled

-that he fulfilled this function during KOVSHUK's two 30-day

leave periods in 1960 and 1961, but he did not remember
when this leave occurred in those years. He also served as
Acting Chief for about a month in the summer of 1960 when
KOVSHUK was in the KGB hospital with heart trouble and for @
week or two some time in 1961 when KOVSHUK.was i11 again.
NOSENKO was unable to recall any operational or. inspection
trips that KOVSHUK made in 1960 or 1961, and the only other
spe¢ific time that he could remember KOVSHUK being absent
was for several days in connection with preparations for
feces Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in
60.

NOSENKO's: description of-his duties in KOVSHUK'’s ab-
tooth wag summarized in a protocol which he signed on -3;March

tion, nor any unusual things that happened during

these times. The only specific responsibility KOVSHUK
had. which I handled in his absence was te report to
the Chicf of the First Department about all mail going
out of the First Section. I did not meet- any of. KOV-
SHUK’s agents during his absences because there was.no
necessity to do so. His only Russian agent whoa I
remember was Ilya GLAZUNOV [.KGB cryptonym "VRUBEL"],
whom he transferred to FEDYANIN in 1960, I thisk. The
only other agent of KOVSHUK's whom I remember was the
correspondent Edaund STEVENS.* The only thing that was
different for me as Acting Chief of the Section was
that I had to go every day tu see the Chief of the De~
partment.

©. Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations

(4) Introduction

Among the numcrous KGB activities against American code
clerks in Moscow which NOSENKO has discussed are five opera-
tions wherein the KGB intended or effected approaches for
recruitment/defection ‘purposes. According to NOSENKO, none
was successful... The five major cases are reviewed separately
below, one of them in tae context of duty trips abroad by
NOSENKO's subordinate KOSOLAPOV, **

NOSENKO said that, upon assuming responsibility for
supervising operations against American code clerks, he
found a very "difficult situation." Prior to the assignment H 4
of KOSOLAPOY to the U.S. Embassy Section in late 1959, all
operations against code clerks had beens handled by A.S. MALYU-

GIN, but during MALYUGIN's two years of effort. there had Hi
beer no operational approaches and no successes. When poe

*The Edmund STEVENS case is discussed in Part V.C.2.

**GOLITSYN on 20 March 1962 identitied KOSOLAPOV's photograph
as that of a veteran KCB officer with whom ke was personally
‘acquainted. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had entered the KGB
in about 1952 and had served for two or three years as a
member of the First [American] Department of the KGB First
Chief Directorate under United Nations cover in New York City;
subsequently he had worked for two or three years in the
First Chief Directorate at KGB Headquarters. According to
GOLITSYN, the bachelor KOSOLAPOV was transferred to the KGB
Second Chief Directorate some time prior to 1960 in line with i
a KGB policy for only married men to be sent abroad. As of
1960, GOLITSYN said, KOSOLAPOV was working against code clerks |
stationed in the American Embassy in Moscow. He added that # i ae
KOSOLAPOV speaks excellent English. Prior to GOLITSYN's v
identification, CIA had no indication of intelligence acti- 7
vity on KOSOLAPOV's part. Between February 1953 and April j
1955 he was assigned to the United Nations: Secretariat Trans- ee
lation Unit as a translator; in August 1958 he had been an
interpreter at the Geneva Conference on Nuclear Test Detection;
in September 1959 he accompanied KHRUSHCHEV on his trip to
the United States (sce Part V.E.3.d. which desoribes the
role of NOSENKO's target John ABIDIAN in connection with the
. KHRUSHCHEV trip). KOSOLAPOV's English is flawless.

_/ /from other sources, are summarized in this order

On the several operetions ageinst military code clerks
which. SOSENKO has described and in which he has claimed a
personal role, his, greatest detail and emphasis has been given
to the case of James Harry STORSRERG. In 1962 NOSENKO said .
that, in line with GRIGANOV‘s instructions € he pay parti-
cular attention to code clerk operations, he devoted most of
his time for almost a year to the STORSLERG operation, ané
played a persona: role in the unsuccessful KGS approach; he
described in th t person his conversation with STCRSBERG.
During tre 1964 to 1966 périod, NUSENKO denied not only that
he had personally participated in this way but also that he
had ever claimed to have dcne: he continued to say, however,
that he supervised the cperation from peginning to end. Ac-

tcitlndiinacendaas

e time in the farst half of 1960 Tne specific aim
this agent was to involve S70RS%ERG in compromising
activities, which would ¢ form the basis for the approach.
The operation drecged on through 1960 and until the spring,
summer, or autum: of 1961; at this time N.S SKVORTSOV, a KGB
officer, was introduced in the guise of a wealthy french busi-
nessman to contince the development of compromising informa-
tion. PREISFREUND was then withdrawn from the operation,
Several weeks later STORSEERS wa: approached, principally on
the basis of his financial need, sut he rejected the KGB bid
and the cperatior.was over. NOSENKO was certain that STORS-
BERG had not reported the epproach and said that the KG3 would
use this fact as an additional element of pressure should 4
STORSBERS again te posted outside the United States, NOSENKO :
also kr.ew that GCLITSYN had reported to CIA concerning KGB
modus operandi in this case as well as PREISFREUND's part in
it.

GOLITSYN in early 1962 had, in fact, told CIA about

PREISFREUND having been used by the KGB in an operation again:

: A second item from GOLITSYN may also relate to the STORS-
BERG operation: GGLITSYN told.of learning in the spring of
1960 that the KGB had developed a military code clerk in Mos-"
cow tothe point that recruitment was virtually assured. Ac-
cording to U.S. Army records, only two military code clerks
were stationed there at that time, STORSBERG and his superior
William S, HURLEY, the military communications officer who
additionally performed cryptographic duties. NOSENKO has -
said that there was no. KGS ‘operation against HURLEY, and
HURLEY has reported no approach.

In addition to the detailed information given -by NOSENKO
on this case, the FBI and Army Intelligence have interviewed
STORSEERG (who cor.firmed NOSENKO‘s account and denied recruit-
ment) and CIA has talked to the RGB agent PREISFREUND (who
also generally confirmed the inf. ion given by NOSEYKO

(c) Information from PREISFREUND

CIA initially interviewed PREISFREUND on 8 July 1965 in
Helsinki. (NOSENKO himself had suggested that PREISFHEUND
would confirm his story of the STORSBERG case.) During this
first meeting with him, PREISFREUND correctly identified photo-
graphs of KOVSHUK, NOSENKO, and STORSBERG. He maintained, how-
ever, that his relationship with KOVSHUK and NOSENKO was strictly
on a business level, that he had never had anything to do with
the KGB, and that he did not know what the initials "KGB" stand
for. Toward the end of this meeting, PREISFREUND allowed that
he may have been unwittingly involved in some activity acainst
STORSBERG and agreed to tell the “entire truth" the following day.

On 9 July 1965 PREISFREUND described how he had been caught
in a blackmarket operaticn in Moscow and was, on this basis, re~
cruited by KOVSHUK "either at the end of 1959 or early 1960."
Several weeks later, he said, he was approached by NOSENKO who
explained that KOVSHUK was unavailable and that the KGB wanted
him, PREISFREUND, to arrange an introduction between STORSBERG
anda Soviet female, Irina, the daughter of a Soviet general.*
PREISFREUND then left Moscow, and when he returned about two
months later, he took STCRSBERG to che Peking Restavrant, where
the introduction was effected. SISFREUND, STORSBERG, Irina,
and another girl then went to PREISFREUND's hotei, where STORS~
BERG and Irina were intimate.

PREISFREUND said on 10 July 1965 that he was fairly certain
his recruitment took place in early 1960, probably in March or
April. At the time KOVSHUK had refused to explain what tne KGB
wanted him to do; he said only that they weuld talk about it
later but assured PREISFREUND that he would not be asked to
undertake anything detrimental to Finnish interests; nor did
KOVSHUK establish any means of communications with PREISFREUND,
telling him only that the KGB would know where to find him.
PREISFREUND subsequently visited the USSR on several occasions,
but no contects were made. Just as he was beginning to believe
that the affair had been forgotten, NOSENKO contacted him at
his room in the Berlin Hotel in Moscow. Asked to explain his
earlier statement that NOSENKO first met with him two weeks
after the recruitment, PREISFREUND said he could not remember
exactly how long it was, but that it was definitely on another
trip to Moscow and that it was probably several months later.

PREISFREUND was asked how he had first met STORSBERG. . He
first replied that it had been at America House and recalled
that NOSENKO had simply told him to go there and "find Jim;"
ig was only with some difficulty that he finally managed to
strike up an acquaintance at the bar. On second thought, PREIS-
PREUND said, he may have first met STORSBERG at the sauna in
the Finnish Embassy in Moscow through a mutual Finnish acquaint-
ance. Throughout this initial period, NOSENKO and KOVSHUK made
repeated promises that once the introduction of STORSBERG to
the Soviet female had been accomplished, there would be no more

_ Gemands made of PREISFREUND by the KGB. PREISFREUND added:

¥~—Recording to NOSENKO, this was Irina LEBEDOVSKAYA, an
pe be of the U.S. Embassy Section who was.handled by A.V,

. PREISFACUND was eventually succesaful, he said, in introduc-

Leningrad by autoso!ile with his family for about five days,
beginning on or about 23 July. He said that he had learned from
his business contacts in Moscow and from hotel personnel there

(4d) Information from GOLITSYN

GOLITSYN, who had served the KGB most recently as a counter-
intelligence officer in Helsinki during 1966 and 1961, reported
separately two possibly related leads to operations against Am-
erican personnel assigned to the United States Erbassy in Moscow.
One of these was a developmental operation against a military
code clerk which the KGB felt was ost certain of success, the
other a recruitment approach Lo an Empassy employee which GOLIT~
SYN was told had bi successful. GOLTTSY arned these two i
items of information from different Kiv Second Caief Directorate i
officers at different times,

GOLITSYN provided the first of these leads on 23 December i
1961, when he reported info he sai arned during
conversations with his perse frie at KGB Head-
quarters in Moscow some time between Suly 1966.* At
that time GOLIZSYN was visit the & partih t of the
Second Chief Directorate in coanectio.
for assignment in Helsinki as a Pirst
inteliigence officer. YAZNOV told GOLT
had personally p ed an cperation
tary code clerk to the point that the KGB was "99 per cent sure”

i ¢ approach to this code clerk would be suc-
subsequently aarre
gation with GRYAZNOV down tc "April or May 196
GPYAZNOV as saying that the KGB "is certain that ne recruitment
is preparec and will be successful." GOLITSYN also said that
the recruitment plan for this operation “evzdently involved a
woman," but could provide no further details. Duri @ same
talks, according to GOLITSYN, GRYA: V said that
KGB had earlier recruited U.S. Depactment of State code clerks
in Moscow, this would be the first recruitment of a code clerk
in the office of the American Military Attache since the estab-
lishment of the Second Cnief Directorate's American Department :
(in the 1940's).

GOLITSYN reported on the second operation on 26 February
1962, while discussing the KGB agent PREISFREUND. GOLITSYN
said that he first met PREISFREUND when the latter went to the
Soviet Embassy in Helsinki in connection with an application
for travel to the USSR. On several later occasions, GOLITSYN
said, the two men had drinks together in Helsinki cafes.
According to GOLITSYN, PREISFREUND had been used in the recruit- :
ment in Moscow of at least one American who “could have been a
code clerk or a diplomat." He also knew that the recruitment
had been accomplished "in 1960, at the end of 1960" and that
PREISFREUND, having met the target at America House in Moscow,
had helped to set up the target for the recruitment approach
by involving him in speculatory activities and by arranging his
introduction to various KGB female agents. GOLITSYN thought
that PREISFREUND had dropped out of the case after "he had helped
to create the circumstances” and had not taken a direct part in

a

Hl ¥Kecording to NOSENKO, he himself was GRYAZNOV's superior at
: this time. NOSENKO did not recali visits by GOLITSYN to the
U.S. Embassy Section in 1960.

~the American Department,* while GOLITSYN was temporarily in Moscow

during "December 1960."** GOLITSYN related that he had visited
the American Department to request permission to use PREISFREUND
operationally in Helsinki. This request was refused with the
explanaticn: "You see, he (PREISFREUND) helped us in one recruit-

a result of a drinking incident, HOVSHUK was oted from De- +
puty Chief of the American Department to Chief of its American : ¢
Embassy Section in 1959 and held this position until early 1962.
GOLITSYN said he had known KOVSIUK for about years and i
characterized him as a capable officer with about 15 years of -
KGB experience, at least ten of them in the American Department, :
Seconé Chief Directorate. In about 1956, according to GOLITSYN, i
KOVSHUK was handling KG3 agent Henry SHAPIRO. Cia records show
that in addition, KOVSHUK was involved in the Moscow and Wash-
ington phases of the "ANDREY* case (he was identified by Dayle
SMITH; see Part VI.D.3.b.) and in the development in Moscow of Hl
CIA officer George WINTERS (who identified his photograph; see t
Part VI.D.7.c.). According to NOSEWKO, KOVSHUK took personal
part in the recruitments of Roy RHODES and Dayle SMIGH, in the d
approach to Arny Attache Walter MULE, code clerk Louis MANNHEIM, {

State Department Officer Richard HARMSTONE, and code clerk :
James STORSBERG, and in the interrogations of CIA officers ee ae
Russell LANGELLD and Richard JACOS, 4

**GOLITSYN's passport and travel records held by CIA confirm that
GOLITSYN travelled only twice to the Soviet Union after his
arrival in.Helsinki on 20 July 1960. The first of these trips

. was on 19 January 1961, when he flew cirectly from Helsinki to

Moscow; he returned to Helsinki by rail a week later, on 28

January. GOLITSYN's second trip to the Soviet Union was from

9 to 15 April 1961, when he appears to have spent all or most

of this period in Leningrad. A Finnish national, whom GOLITSYN

had been developing in Helsinki, has reported that he met with

GOLITSYN in Leningrad on a daily basis from 10 through 13 April

1961. Moreover, GOLITSYN has never mentioned being in Moscow

during this time. Since GOLITSYN remained in Helsinki from

April until December 1961, when he defected, it appears that

he erred by one month in reporting the date of his conversa-

tions in the American Department and that he learned of the
second lead some time during the week of 19 January 1961. This
is the same conversation of which NOSENKO spoke several times ~

‘dn 1962 and subsequently (see above). NOSENKO has always

Maintained that’ he was out of Moscow on leave at the time of —

GOLITSYN's visit and that this was in the summer of 1961. When

he was told in February 1965 that GOLITSYN was in Moscow. in-

January i961, NOSENKO replied that CIA was ejther wrong or

Was attempting to deceive him. NOSENKO. declined to. change

his. story of the summer leave. rs

“ ne _.. te) Information from other Sources

Information available to CIA indicates that the Attaches of*
the three U.S. military services represented in Moscow shared
a single cryptographic center as of 1960 and 1961 and that,
i except for overlapping assignients during periods of turnover, ’
i there was normally only one military code clerk assigned to the °
Embassy at any particalar time, This military code clerk was
responsible for enciphering and deciphering the traffic of all
three military services. In practice, at least one other mem-
ber of the Attache staff in Moscow has held a cryptographic
clearance and has been trained and has performed the function
of back-up for the military code clerk during periods of the
latter's absence from the Moscow Embassy or inability to per-
form his functions for other reasons.

During the period of STORSBERG's tour in Moscew, back-up

aptitude and lack of interest; in June 1961 he was removed from
Moscow because of reported homosexual activities.

®~NOSZNKO has described an cperation against KEYSERS (see

below), but because of the date of KEYSERS' arrival in Moscow,
he must be ruled out as a candidate for the first of GOLIT-
SYN's two leads discussed above. On the basis of available
information, it appears that the subject of this lead must
have been either STORSBERG or HURLEY, the only two “military

“code clerks" in Moscow in the spring of 19€C0. The subject

of GOLITSYN's second lead could have been STOPSSERG, HURLEY,
or, in fact, anyone else at the Embassy, although GOLITSYN
suggested that he might be a code clerk and might be a mili-
tary man. By his statement that there was no KGB operation
against HURLEY, together with his description of the opera-
tion against STORSBERG beginning in the spring of 1960 and
his (and PREISFREUND's) assertion that PREISFREUND took part
in only one operation for the KGB--that against STORSBERG--
NOSENKO has said in effect that both of GOLITSYN's leads were
to the STORSBERG operation, which ended in failure. This con-
flicts with GOLITSYN's report that PREISPREUND was involved
in a successful recruitment operation in late 1960. There are
also inconsistencies between the NOSENKO and-GOLITSYN leads
as regards the progress. of the.operation. .GOLITSYN reported
that recruitment of a code clerk was "99 per cent" assured

in May-June 1960, whereas NOSENKO and PREISPREUND describe

an operation which, at best, was just becoming active at that
time. GOLITSYN, in reporting his second lead, said that the
operation in which PREISFREUND participated culminated “in

- late 1960;" NOSENKO’ reported that the only operation in which

PREISFREUND took part ended in an unsuccessful approach to
Craciane in "mid-1961" or,..on other occasions, in "autumn.

Sea



(44) To¥'s by FOSOLAPOV on Code Clerk Cases
(a) Introduction

According to NOSENKO, the U.S. Embassy Section officer
ROSOLAPOV travelled only once to Helsinki, and KOSOLAPOV at-:
that time succeeded in his mission of accompanying--together.
with a KGB female agent--a suspected American code clerk, Paul
Prancis JENNER, by train to Moscow, (The KGB later learned
that JENNER was nct a code clerx but a pouch clerk who also met
couriers at the Mcscow airport, NOSENKO said, and this KGB iden-
tification of JENNER's specialty is confirmed by U.S. Department
of State files.) .The report by NOSENXO on KOSOLAPOV is contra-
dicted ky two sources, travel records available to CIA and the
KGB defector GOLITSYN.

Statements made by JENNER in 1960 and i962 parallel those
of NOSENKO in 1964 and 1963 to the extent that two young Soviets,
aman and a woman, did converse with him on the train, and later
JENNER did encounter the same woman at a Moscow airport. Never-
theless, travei records contradict NOSENKO's statement that

KOSOLAPOV was the Soviet male aboard the train with JENNER on the

‘24-horr journey.

Although NOSENKO insisted that KOSOLAPOV was on a single
TDY to Finland, in early 1960, travel records show that KOSOLA-
POV (under a different identity) went to Relsinki in both the
spring and fall of 1960. Travel records on the second Helsinki
TDY by KCSOLAPCV, on which NOSENKO has not reported, are borne
out by GOLITSYN. GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV, in order to lay
the groundwork fcr a future relationship in Mcscow, accompanied
a U.S. Embassy code clerk by train from Helsinki about November
1960, or perhaps as late as the beginning of 1361. Again on
the basis of travel records, it has been determined that on
16 November 1960 KOSOLAPOV was a fellow passenger of an American
code clerk named John W. GARLAND on the daily train from Hel-
sinki to Moscow.

The following discussion of the TDY¥'s of KOSOLAPOV is
divided into three parts: KOSOLAPOV's false identity for
travel, the early 1969 TDY, and the November 1960 TDY. Each
part incorporates the information from all sources, including
NOSENKO.

(b) False Identity for Travel

Vadim Viktorovich KOSOLAPOV was born in Perm’ on 19 Febru-
ary.1928. According to travel records, one Viktor Dmitriyevich
KOLOSOV, born in Perm‘ on 19 March 1927, was in Finland from
31 March to 2 April 1960, in Finland from 12 to 16 November 1960,
and in Denmark from 25 October to 1 November 1961.* In July 1965,
Johan PREISFREUND (see Part V.E.3.c.ii.',on STORSBERG operation)
identified for CIA a photograph of KOLOSOV as that of a KGB offi-
cer named Vadim (last name unknown) who approached him in Moscow

‘¥~ROSENRO reported that KOSOLAPOV travelled to Copenhagen in
1961 to recontact the YOUNGERS, an American man and wife who
were arrested for espionage and recruited by the KGB while
touring the USSR in 1961 (see Part VI.D.2.). a mire

ROSOLAPOV.

How old was JENNER at the time?

I don't know. We sent GRYAZNOV's agent, a ballerina,
to Vyborg as part of this operaticn. I think her .
first name is Yeva, but I don't remember her last
name; her code name was “SOLISTXA"... She was placed
on the train in Vyborg as if she had been visiting
someone there and was returning to Moscow. The main
idea was to place an agent near J.
even arrived in Noscow. We-wrote a proposal to the
Chairman of the KGB giving the reasons for doing this.
We explained that we had usually only one year in
which to work. The agent “SOLISTKA" met JENNER and
spoke with him. KOSOLAPOV also became acquainted
with JENNER and spoke with him, but I can't say that
they were all speaking together at one time. She
gave JENNER a telephone number.

A KGB telephone number?

Of course not; it was her own telephone number, but
he didn't call her. We then noticed that he wasn't
working in the code room but in the mail room. 0.K.,
that was interesting too. We waited one or two
months for the call to come, but nothing happened.
When JENNER once went to the railroad station or
airport alone to meet the couriers, we sent her with
GRYAZNOV by car in an attempt to have them meet
again. JENNER saw her but did not approach {her}.
Instead, he turned in the other direction. Only
later did we learn that he is a very quiet person.
There was nothing else on JENNER at all except a
suspicion that he may have been a homosexual, but
there was no proof. He was like a child.

How much time did you have between the time of the
anketa's arrival and the time of JENNER's arrival?

A month, plenty of time to prepare.
A month?

GRYAZNOV sent "SOLISTKA" alone to Vyborg and had the
local KGB:officers there meet her and place her on
the correct train, They knew the date and would
establish the fact that KOSOLAPOV was on that train
before placing her aboard...

. * Also on 15 February 1965 NOSENKO made the following addi-~

It’s 1960. He made a trip in 1950, in March, to
Helsinki by train using this name, KOLOSOV, and us-
ing this cover, Vneshtorg, and we also have a report
from official Finnish sources that he left Helsinki
by train on 2 April 1960 and went to Moscow.

I don't remember the dates. member, Must

here, which you just 2aw.

On the visa certificate, anketa, wich this picture
of Paul JENNER, it was sald that he must come; we
knew that he must come 1 April or 15 March, or some~
thing of this kind.

But we have the official records showing KOLOSOV's,
or KOSOLAFOV's, arrival on 31 March.

I cannot give you any details, All I have said,
everything what I knew. Tf you need scmething on
KOSOLAPGV, I will try to remember.

The interesting thing is KOLOSOV, or KOSOLAPOV, left
Helsinki on 2 April, JENNER, Paul JiNNER, according
to the same official sources, left sinki by train
to go to Moscow on the 3lst. Two days before.

They were going in one train,
They weren't even on the same train.

Here, please, they were going in one train.
KOSOLAPOV remained in Helsinki.

(interrupts) KOSOLAPOV in one even carriage, in one
even carriage with Paul JENNER, Then...

(interrupts) How do you know this for sure?

I was reading his report after his coming. TI was
reading also the agent's report of the female agent
who was put in this carriage, in this carriage in

this train, and at the station Vyborg, the first
Soviet station, Vyborg, where she was taken by
GRYAZNOV, and was put in the same carriage, and she
was acquainted with JENNER. And later, it was a

try, as I was telling, to show her to JENNER, but
JENNER didn't want to have a contact with her.

That's all. It was finished... And she was acquainted
with him and was speaking with JENNER, and KOSOLAPOV
himself was speaking with JENNER... I was reading
KOSOLAPOVts otchet [official account} about his [trip].

That's quite possible. It's quite possible that they
gave you a report to read concerning this. But it

is a fact that official records show that the two men
were not on the same train. They were two days apart.

No (whispered).

The remaining information on KOSOLAPOV's TDY in early 1960
comes from other sources:

- After arriving in Moscow on 1 April 1960, JENNER
reported that he was approached on the train from Helsinki
by two young Russians, “a boy and a girl, probably uni-
versity students."* The two Russians struck up a conver~
gation and were soon baiting him on the question of racial
Giscriminetion in the United States, They said that they
might see JENNER in Moscow. About three months later, on
29 dune, 5 was performing his normal duty of escort~
fing Enbassy couriers to Sneremetevo Airport when he was
again acproached by the Bussian girl, Yuli, who acted
surprised to see him and asked him to go outside to talk.
Yuli explained that she was waiting to say goodbye to
friend who was leaving on 4 flignt te Irkutsk (JENNER had
geen the Irkutsk flight depart a half hour earlier) and 4
tcld JENNER that her male companion on the train trip to
Moscow, Yura, had returned to his studies in Vyborg.

Interspersed with Yuli's questions concerning JENNER's

impressions and personal activities in Moscow were others
about how often he came to the airport and how he liked
his job at the Embass: When JENNER said he must leave,
she gave him her telephone number in Moscow and insisted
that he call her.** She advised JENNER that "it would be
better if you did not mention our conversation to anyone.” i :

- Besides information about his Soviet companions on : i
the Moscow journey, JENNER also told U.S. Department of
State security officials about sexual advances made by
his first maid in Moscow and about provocative clothing i
worn by his second maid. (NOS. O has not indicated that
either of these two women was u KGB agent, but has said
in another context that all maids of American code clerks
were KGB agents or informants.)

- CIA investigations showed that I. Ye. SERGEYEV, a
KGB officer and the Soviet Consul in Helsinki, contacted
the police chief there on 31 March 1960 to ask his assist-
ance in locating an American named Paul 7, JENNER who was
Gue to arrive in Helsinki the day before.*** SERGEYEV

explained that he had some "business" with JENNER, but he

¥—KOSOLAPOV was 32 years of age at the time.

*SOLISTKA" gave JENNER her telephone number.

Helsinxi, under the KOLOSOV ali He has reported that at

The following extracts are from the transcript of GOLITSYN's
further remarks on this subject in early 1962:

Question: You say that around November 1960 KOSOLAPOV came
to Finland?

GOLITSYN: Came to Finland.

Question: He came under cover?

GOLITSYN: Yes.

Question: Under a new identity? With an alias?

GOLITSYN: Yes, as an employee of Trade Union (Vnesktorg).

You understand what I'm telling, you?

.Yes,; I understand. And KOSOLAPFOV must tell him about

the code clerk, kut we found out that Paul JENNER is
not a code clerk when he began to work at the Embassy.

This is not Paul JENNER. This is a different time

(interrupts) When he began to work in Embassy.

This is not March 1960, This is November 1960. A
different time. It's the same year, but a different
time.

I know only about his trip when he was returning with
Paul JENNER.

Well, how do you explain that this man, who's suppesed
to be under your supervision in the Embassy Section,
is aboard this train with this American code clerk,
one of your targets, in November 1960?

I know only about one trip [by] KOSOLAPOV to Hel=
sirté, when he was returning with Paul JENNER, about
whon!’ he was thinking also that he was a code clerk.
Yes.

KOSOLAPOV or KOLOSOV was not on the same train with
GENNER. We have the names; we have the facts; we
have the official records. We also have GOLITSYN's
information about November 1960. GOLITSYN went with
KOSOLAPOV to the train station to see him off.

He must. He was working as a case officer of counter~
intelligence, of the Fourteenth Department. Of course
he must, of course he must. And KOSOLAPOV must speak
with him.

KOSOLAPOV spoke with GOLITSYN, and KOSOLAPOV rode
with this American code clerk from Helsinki on the
train back to Moscow. But GOLITSYN was not in Hel-
sinki when JENNER was there. It wasn't JENNER.

With Paul JENNER I know, but I don't know of anybody
else... You are giving me such a big bluff. I don't
know, I don't know, I don't know.

It's no bluff. Do you have any idea who this other
code clerk was? ;

No. There wasn't such a one.

Well, I'll tell you who it. was Did you ever hear

the name GARLAND?

(iv) . K6B-Polish Up Activities Against MORONE

{a) Introduction

In 1961 CIA iearned from a Polish source who furnished
much reliable and sensitive information that, with the .assist~
ance of its Polish counterpart, the Office of Security (UB),

the KGB in November 1960 began using a female agent against
Joseph MORONE, a U.S. Department of State cede clerk assigned
to the American Embassy in Moscow in August 1960, The woman
accompanied MORONE on a train trip from Moscow, became inti-
mate with him in Warsaw, returned te Moscow twice in February
1961, and there had sexual relations with him, The compromising
scenes of MORONE and the Polish UB agent were photographed.
This information cn the KGB operation was received by CIA soon
after the woinan's second visit to Moscow. On the basis of this
report, MORONE was interviewed and polygrapked in Oslo in May
i961, and he was transferred to Lisben from Moscow in August
1961.

eereesiets aceite

NOSENKO gave a fev details on the same case, without men-
tioning the name of the KGB target, during the 1962 meetings in
Geneva. In 1964 and 1965 he furnished more particulars on the
MORONE case, identifying three KGB agents (besides the Polish :
female) who participated in the operation. NOSENKO, however, i
said that two cf them added no information of use to the KGB H
against MORONE, and that he was unable to remember what the third
agent reported: statements by other sources indicate that re-
garding MORONE all three agents could have acquired information
of operational potential for the KGE. NOSENKO has not reported,
as have other sources, that. a fourth KGB agent named Ella UMANETS
was in contact with MORONE, or that the KGB officer SKVORTSOV-~
posing as MICHAUD--was with MORONE at America House on at least
one occasion, the night when STORSBERG says he was approached
by the KGB (see above). NOSENKO has confused the MORONE case
with another by saying that a fifth XGB agent was directed
against MORONE, whereas she was apparently directed against the
American code clerk ZUJUS (see below). The sensitive source of
the original report on MORCNE stated that a KGB officer "VOLODYA"
“Vladimir, last name unknown) personally met the Polish female
agent when she arrived in Moscow, and NOSENKO said that the
KGB officer was his subordinate KOSOLAPOV. NOSENKO at first
claimed a KGB photographic technician supporting the case re-
ported to him, but he retracted this remark after CIA showed
him that travel records on NCSENKO made it impossible for the
technician to have spoken to him as he described. According to
NOSENKO, MORONE was reassigned from Moscow before the KGB could
take further steps against the code clerk, and he speculates
MORONE's transfer was prompted by American authorities’ concern
over his relationship with one of the KGB female agents.

(b) NOSENKO's Information

At his first meeting with CIA on.9 June 1962 NOSENKO made E
a passing reference to an operation in which he had placed a .
female agent of the Polish service in contact with an American
from the Moscow Embassy while the latter was visiting Warsaw.
Later, NOSENKO said, he brought the same female to Moscow. in a
order to obtain further compromising materials on this American.



Asked on 11 June 1962 whether he haé had foreign agents
working against the U.S. Embassy, NOSENKO described his having
introduced the idea of using such agents to :develop- Americans.

afraid of contacts with Russian girls. .Hé said that he himself .-

had several of these third-national ‘agents, that he sometimes
would ask the German and Polish services to supply him with
agents, and that it was unnecessary for him to explain their
intended use in operations against Americans. NOSEXKO then
gave an example: "Listen, the sergeants [enlisted men] who
lived in America House had a custom--it was to2 far to go-to
America, so where did they go to rest fon leave}? To Finland
or Poland. Why Poland? Because they can find wonen there, the
rate of exchange is gOod, and so ou. What do we do? We planted
a female Polish agent [on an American] in Poland. Then she
comes to Moscow, We arranged a chancé meeting, and things de~
veloped. Once two guys, a Marine guard and a coje clerk went to
Warsaw. They were on leave for a weex and a half. We knew
when they would be coing. I made an imzediate phone call to
Warsaw. 'Give me 2 woman,' I said. et a gced whore for me
there, a pretty one but not one who strikes the.eye particu-
larly.' Well, they sent me such a girl. And I placed this
Polish agent on the same train, in the same car, even in the
same compartment. ‘The train left. One of the Americans, the
one in whom we were particularly interested, the code clerk,
wanted the girl and there, in the compartment, ey went to bed
together wh le the other American slept. I toid the Poles in
Warsaw to give the gir) an apartment and to get photographs.
They arranged an apartment and he there. Everything was
O.K. After a week ané a half he returned to Mescow. We did
not rush things. A month passed. Two months. Let's not rush,
I said. A haif a year went by. I insisted thav nothing further
may Le done any earlier. Then I said, ‘All right, let's give
him this girl, this Pole.’ She arrived {in Moscow] and they met
one another. I created the conditions: we created the condi-
tions. They slept with one another once, twice. A [soviet]
girlfriend showed up. The same thing. And he also began to
sleep with the girlfriend. The Pole left and he was with this
*Russian, and she was our agent. You see, first the boys are
afraid of Russians. But {we gave him] a Pole and then transe
ferred him to a Russian.”

NOSENKO stated on 1 February 1964: "I remember we were
working on one of the members of the guard of the American Em-
bassy, who was going to Warsaw for a good time, for a few days'
relaxation.* We wrote to our advisors [GB officers attached
‘to the Polish UB) to do éverything possible--to get a pretty
Polish girl for the fellow and to photograph any intimate
scenes. The Poles introduced the guard to the girl, they did
have intimate relations, but they gave us photographs without
any intimate scenes. Just how they are sitting together, how
he is kissing her--that's all. Well, we got these photographs
and some time went by and then we asked that the Poles send 5
us this Polish girl so that she could meet him in Moscow. They |

WOSENKO said that the KGB agents working on MORONE were:

House who reported to DENI, the case officer responsi-
ble for Americans living there, on everything ehe saw or
heard concerning MORONE. KOSOLAPGY visited her several
times with DEMKIN to discuss MORONE, and NOSENKO hinself

man girl was documented as an Austrian. NOSENNO never

replied that she had left them at her hctel, left America i

time when this incident occurred, beyond the fact that ha
was still in the U.S. Embassy Section and that ABIDIAN
was the Erbassy security officer at the time.*

~- GEER, an Italian Qeg> at the Anerican
Embassy and KOSOLAPOV's agent,’ reported everything he :
heard or saw about Americans to KOSOLAFOV. NOSENKO re-
called nothing specific that Ge had said about MORONS.

CIA has no information concerning such an incident in 1960-
1961, but the circumstancés described by ‘NOSENKO seem to
apply to those surrounding a relationship between a woman
named Lillian (last name not known) and the military code
clerk ZUJUS. These details are given in Part V.=£.3.c.(v).
In any_event, the incident involving Lillian occurred after
the date when NCSENKO says he was transferred fron the U.S.
Embassy Section. At the time, Hugh MONTGOMERY ieee than
,ABIDIAN was. the Exbassy Security Officer :



From one of these agents, or possibly in some other man ~
ner, the KG8 learned that MORONE was planning to jo'on leave
to Warsaw. NOSENKO, KOSOLAPOV, and GRYAZNOV thereupon Secided

was deliberately kept from the Foles.

As a result of this meeting, a Polish girl was obtained

Because the KGB still lacked ccmpromising materials, KCSO-

to Moscew and permission to acquire compromising photosrephy
during her visit. The requests were approved by higher KGB
authority. When the girl arrived, KOSOLAPOV met her alone and
took her to the Hotel Peking, to a specially equipped room.

The girl called MORONE at America itquse, and MORONE subsequently
visited her in the hotel room two or three times, during which
photographs were taken. These were placed in the KGB's file on
MCRONE. He did not fall in love with the girl, as the KGB had
hoped, and she had no further contacts with hia,

Although the KGB had. the. compromising photography, it was
felt that. there were insufficient materials for a recruitment
approach #o MOROKE. The KGB wanted to trap him in the apart-
ment of a Soviet woman, to catca him in something that is defi-
nitely prohibited. for this pursose, Svetlana IVANOVA (see
above) was ‘supposed to lure NORCNE into the city, but before
anything further could be done, the Americans ordered MORONE
out of Moscow before the end of his tour, possibly because they
were concerned about his association with IVANOVA. Therefore,
NOSENKO said, the KGB made no operational approach to MORONE
and no recruitment of him.

(ce) Inforraticn from Cther Sources

A sensitive Polish source reported in 1961 that on 8 Novem-
ber 1960 a Polish fexale, an experienced English-speaking agent
of the Polish UB, arrived in Moscow where she was met by a KGB
case officer namel "V OYA." She stayed at the Hotel Warsaw
in Moscow. The ¥GB case officer, apparently from the American
Department of KGS Second Chief Directorate, on 10 November
1969 pointed MORONE out to this agent at a railroad station in
Moscow. Under KGB insctructions, the Folish female met MORONE
on the train to Warsaw, where intimacies began. In Warsaw on
12 November 1960 she was quite friendly with MORONE, but pur-
suant to instructions, she refused all overtures to engage in
intimacies. The next day she took MORONE to a Polish UB safe~
house suitably prepared for clandestine photography, and reveal-
ing photographs of an intimate nature were taken of MORONE
and herself. The female agent again travelled to Moscow on
5 February 1961 and stayed at the Peking Hotel. Further com-
promising photographs were taken of her and MOPONE oa this
trip. The female agent travelled to Moscow a third time and
on 12 and 13 February 1961 more photograpas were taxen of her
and MORONE.

GOLITSYN was questioned on the basis of this lead on
16 February 1962:

(c) Infcrmation from Other Sources ’

In connection with a security investigation at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow, ZUJUS prepared a statement in January 1963
which ‘acknowledged his having had sexual relations with only
one woman in Moscow, an employee of the Finnish Embassy.
During 2 routine debriefing by U.S, Army authorities later in

“1963, however, ZUJUS said that he had once had sexual relations

with a girl who Said she was an Austrian. ‘The U.S. Embassy
Security Officer reported in the summer of 1962 that, 2UJUS.

a. NOSENKO's Reeponsibility for Coverage of ABIDEAN

(4) Introduction

John V. ABIDIAN served as the U.S. Embassy Security Officer
in Moscow from 2 March, 1960 until February 1962, approximately
the same period as NOSENKO's claimed: service in the U.S. Embassy
Section of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate.
During hig Moscow tour, ABIDIAN was coopted by CIA to perform a
number of operational tasks; including clandestine letter meilings
to several CIA agents inside the Soviet Union and servicing @
ead drop to be used only for receiving two special types of
communications* from the source in the GRU, Colonel 0.V, PENXOV-
SKIY.

During his 1962 meetings with CIA, NOSENKO mentioned ABIDIAR 4
on several occasions, identifying him as the Embassy Security i
Officer and as a CIA officer. In 1962 he described ABIDIAN's

letter matling-activittes;and-hense te he wes ih ese2 CO CL

. (zanimat'sya) with ABIDIAN, After recontacting CIA in Geneva in :
January 1964 NOSENKO divulged that he nad keen the KGB case :
officer responsible for coverage of ABIDJAN in Moscow; for the _
first time he described then a visit made by ASIDIAN to the a
PENKOVSKIY dead drop site. 7

The discussion below is divided into three parts: NOSENKO's
case officer responsibilities and the information he Learned i
about ABIDIAN, NOSENKO's knowledge of clandestine letter mailings
by ABIDIAN, and NOSENKO's statements on ASIDIAN and the Pushkin
Street dead drop. ;

(ii) Duties as Case Officer ae

On 17 April 1964 when asked to describe his transfer from
the Yourist Department to the Arerican Department in January
1960, NOSENKO said that when he reported for duty and was inter-
viewed by V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the American Department, and
V.M, KOVSHUK, Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, he was told
that as one of his duties he would be the case officer in charge
of ABIDIAN, whose arrival in Moscow was expected in the near
future. NOSENKO was the only KGB officer responsible for cover-
age of and activities against ABIDIAN and, NOSENKO said, ASIDIAN
was the only American target for whom he, personally, was offi-
cially accountable while in the U.S. Embassy Section.

NOSENKO was questioned in detail concerning ABIDIAN for
six days in January and Februery 1965. He produced the infor-
mation in the following paragraphs at that time.

*. hen NOSENKO began to work in the U.S. Embassy Section,
ABIDIAN had not yet arrived in Moscow. The section, however,

i already had received some information on him, and this was given © |
‘ t@ NOSENKO by KOVSHUK. Among this material was ABIDIAN's visa =|:

One type was early-warning information, the other notifi-
cation of his forthcoming absence from Moscow, Otherwise,

of this time, PENKOVSKIY submitted information in

‘Moscow via Contacts with the British Embassy and the
British businessman Greville WYNNE. The PENKOVSRIY came ~~

‘ i application, the negative results of checks of KGB Headquarters
files, and a report prepared by the American Department of the
First Chief Directorate. According to this report, based on
correspondence from the KG3 Legal Residencies in the United
States, ABIDIAN had served as.a Departmen: of State Security
Officer concerned with the personal safety of Premier AHRUSHCHEV

when he visited the United States in 1959; from the way ABIDIAY t
had acted at that time, the Legal Residencies concluded he was an
intelligence officer, probably with CIA.” NOSENKO remarked that
the report, combined ‘with the fact that ABSIDIAN was replacing the
known CIA officer Russell LANGELLE as Security Officer, made
ABIDIAN one of the most important counterintelligence targets

of the U.S. Embassy Section and therefore of the entire Second
Chief Directorate.

used by personnel of the verth (Surveillance) Directorate, i

NOSENKO was unsuccessful in his attempts to learn more ebout
the life and career of ABIDIAN. He visited the Chief of the H
American Department of the KGB First Chief Directorate, but this
unit had no information in acdition to that already included in i
the original information ceport, NOSENKO requested that the KGB
Legal Residencies in the Uniced States be asked for further de-
tails, but they were never received. For these reasons, NOSENKO
said that he did not know and never obtained details about ASID-
IAN's education and study abroad. date of entry into the Depart-
ment of State, promotions, personal rank. previous foreign assign- it

and then secured empioyment with the Department of State as
a clerk/typist. He cemained in Paris until 1954, After spe-
cial training at the CIC schoo! at Fort Holabird and the
Secret Service School, ABIDIAN served from 1956 until leaving
for Moscow in 1960 as a special agent in the State Depart-
| ment's Office of Security. A iarge part of his work’in this 2
i period was arranging the security of and accompanying foreign i a fis
: dignitaries visiting the United States. These included the
i . visits of Soviet Foreign Minister SHEPILOV in November 1956,
i MIKOYAN in the spring of 1959, and KHRUSHCHEV at the end of
1959. These duties undoubtedly brought ABIDIAN into contact
with a large number of KGB officers stationed in New York and
Washington. One of the members of the KHRUSHCHEV entourage
was KOSOLAPOV who, according to NOSENKO, joined the U.S.
Embassy Section in late 1959 and, as of January 1960, became
pipe subordinate in operations against American code

ing a Soviet he met while on a trip to Armenia.

®* In 1960-61 the Security Officer occupied a room where an in-
operative microphone was discovered in 1964.

#8*ABIDIAN made at least three trips abroad during his two years
in Moscow. in August 1960 he took personal leave to visit
his fiancee, a French girl, in the south of France and met
with a CIA officer while there. In February 1961 he flew on
the Ambassador's plane to Paris for meetings with CIA and
then took personal leave to visit his fiancee. In September
1961, at CIA request, ABIDIAN again flew to France and to
New York City and Washington for briefings connected with
the handling of PENKOVSKIY in Moscow.

ettghen CIA interrogators suggested that the KGB could have
photographed ABIDIAN’s passport on his return to Moscow,
MOSENKO replied that the Second Chief Directorate does not
photograph passports of foreign diplomats entering the Soviet
Union. dhile this procedure would not be impossible, NOSENKO
added, it was not considered so important as to justify the
special effort involved.

In February 1965 NOSENKO was asked a number of times
whether he knew of any occasions on which A3:D1AN took trips in
the Soviet Urion outside of Moscow. He replied each time that he
knew of no such trips and that if ABIDIAN had made such a trip or
trips he would have known of them and would remember them as it
would have been his responsibility as case officer to take cer-
tain actions. Among the latter he listed:

~ Receiving notification of ABIDIAY's request to travel
from the UPDK (the Soviet Government organization which pro-
vides services to tre diplomatic community in Moscow).

- Notifying the UPDK of KGE approval for the trip.

was made. he would have seen all documents upor his return and Hi
that he @id not remember seeing such cocuments in ABIDIAN's file. t 3

NOSENYO's interrogators then told NOSENKO that ABIDIAN aud
travelled out of Moscow from 5 to 9 October 1940.* Thereupon {

NOSENKO stated that he specifically recalled having been on leave
dn October 1950. He said that he could not recall exactly the i
gates of this leave (which he had not mentioned before), but he 4
did remember that he was away exactly 30 days since he stayed at 4

cations Procurement Officer, to Armenia between 5 and 9 Octe- 4
ber 1960. (ABIDIAN is of Armenian origin, and speaks the
Armenian language with a high degree of proficiency.) While
there ABIDIAN visited with various churchmen and their
parishioners and an Armenian who had repatriated from Greece
in 1946. They attended a service in Echmiadzin celebrating
the anniversary of the accession of the Katolikos VAZGEN I,
and ABIDIAN also visited some relatives of his in or near
the city of Yerevan. After returning to Moscow, an Armenian
whom ABIDIAN had met on this trip tried to contact ABIDIAN
at the Embassy. but ABIDIAN refused to see him. When NOS-
ENKO was told that on 7 October 1960 ASIDIAN attended a ser-
vice celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Armenian Kato-
likes, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO recalled that ABIDIAN had gone to
* Echmiadzin.and that an agent had reported a contact with him
there. This agent, NUSENKO recalled, was a priest or a monk,

show that ABIDIAN mailed the first of his clandestine

“ARKHANGELSKIY", on 2 July 1961. If ABIDIAN's recollec-
tion is correct (a review of Embassy phone lis=s shows that
KEMMER was in Moscow in June 1961, but was not there in
August of that year), it appears that FEDOROVIC! could not
have been responsible for the metka which, NOSENKO said,

is possible that she was not employed hy ABID“AY at the time
the letter to "ARKHANGELSKIY" was mailed. ABIDIAN's third

suggested that FEDOROVICH may have occasionally cleaned
ABIDIAN's apartment on an informal basis before being
formerly red as his maid, NOSENKO said that th. was
possibly the case, (CIA does not know whether this was

so or not, but ABIDIAN gave his interviewer the impression

) ABIDIAN's Servicing of the Pushkin Strect bead Drop

In 1964 NOSENKO told CIA for che first time that KGB sur-
eillance had observed a visit by ASIDIAN to a probable dead
/ drop on Pushkin Street in Moscow at the erd 3£ 1960. This dead
/ drop figured prominently in the PENKOVSKIY case.

t

t

NOSENKO's first remarks on this subject were made on 20 April
1964: "I left /the U.S. Embassy Section’ in 1962, There was an
interesting move. ‘This address w JACOZS* was caught in the
PENKOVSKIY case - the same address was visited by ABIDIAN in
1960, or at the beginning of 1961. And at that time I went there
together with /V. A./ KOZLOV, the Thief of the Surveillance
Directorate. /M. G./ MATVEYEV /Deputy Chief of the Auerican
Department/ also went there with u We went to that address
several times, at Pushkin Street. It was very interesting, this
radiator ard evetything, but the thing we did there was to
place an observation post there, that post was there for
about three months after ABIDIAN's That was in 1960,
196i... They watched for three m surveillance teams
had to_be occupied there for 24 h ay. I was there
then /in the U Embassy Section x the entire time that sur-
veillance was watching the Pushkin Street site’... At the be-

- ginning I came there two or thre es. I ceme there with
MATVEYEV once, twice with KOVSHU! ¢ came there with Venyamin
KOZLOV,.. _But no one appeared here and so they were not writing
anything /meaning that the Surverliance Directorate was not sub-
mitting written reports/. No one peared. That's why, only
orally, KCZLOV was saying ‘nothing A week passed - ‘nothing, '
the next week passed — ‘nothing'... I shall tell you why /T
@idn't mention this to you in June 196Z/. Because I had
occasions where there were many s places, and they were
Watched for nothing. And it would just pass away and in a
month it would be forgotten... So we waited a month, two,
three. Nothing. So they let it go at that and had forgotten.
Of course, the surveillance team hed it_all recorded, but we :
had forgotten about that in the_First /American/ Department...
In 1962, I was in the Seventh CtTourist/ Department. I trans-
ferred in January 1962." E

On the basis of information supplied by NOSENKO during 1
April 1964, he was questioned during January and February 1965
on ABIDIAN's visit to Pushkin Street. The following, which is
Consistent with and somewhat more detailed than earlier state-

eng NOt recorded here, is taken from these 1965 interroga- ‘
tions: :

~ In 1961, while NOSENKO was the responsible case
officer, the KGB followed ABIDIAN from the U.S. Embassy
to @ residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow.
A stationary surveillance post at the Embassy saw ABIDIAN
leave with the Publications Procurement Officer of the
Embassy in a chauffeured automobile, rather than in the
car he normally used. The surveillance team assigned
specifically to ABIDIAN thereupon followed the car to
@ bookstore. Both Americans entered the bookstore, but.

_
® Richard JACOB, a CIA officer, was apprehended while servic- 7
ing the Pushkin Street dead drop on 2 November 1962. fe



shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone, He walked around
the corner and entered a residential bsilding next to a
meat market on Pushkin Street. ABIDIAN emerged after a
few seconds. The surveillance team saw him. go-in but. did
not follow him. This unusual incident was reported by

the surveillance team to the KGB Seventh (Surveillance)
Directorate, and the building was inspected that same day
by the Chief of the First Degartment of the. Surveillance
Directorate, KOZLOV, together with the Deputy Cnief of the
American Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,
MATVEYEV. Taking into account the character of the building
and its inhabitants, the duration and circumstances of
ABIDIAN's visit, and the. suitability of the hallway -
particularly the radiator in it - for use as a dead drop
site, it was decided by the Jeadership of the Second Chief
Directorate and the Surveillance Directorate that a station-
ary surveillance post should immediately be set up to cover

q

tennant

——— + ——E HTS location. Because of the short time evailablé, it was

l

not possible to place this pgst inside the building, so it
was set up ecross the street, In addition, the radiator
was checked daily to see if anything, such as a macnetic
container, had been concealed behind it. This stationary
post was maintained around the clock for 30 days, after
which it was maintained from 0800 until midnight for another
two months. If @ package or magnetic container had been
found behind the radiator, wkich was checked every morning,
it was planned to attach to jt very thin wires to tricgqer
a signal should someone remoye the package. At the same
time a member of the surveiljance team would be stationed
on the landing of the staircase in this building, out of:
sight from the hallway below, During the three months
that the post was maintained, nothing was found concealed
behind the radiator, nor were any suspicious persons seen
entering or leaving the building. The post was then dis-
continued, but the addregs wes placed on a list of sus-
picious places inspected daily by the Surveillance Direc-
torate. The true significance of this location became
known to the KGB only later, after the arrest of PENKOV-
SKIY in 1962. =

+ NOSENKO first heard of ABIDIAN's visit to the sus-
pected dead drop site on the day it occurred. . He was
sitting in KOVSHUK's office when he received a telephone
call from MATVEYEV telling him of the incident. Although
NOSENKO was ABIDIAN's case officer and KOVSHUK was Chief
of the U.S. Embassy Section, the decision to place the
stationary surveillance post on this location was made at
a higher level; neither of them was involved in it or in
the later decision to discontinue the post. NOSENKO him-
self visited the building on Pushkin Street the following
@ay or the day after, but he remained only a few minutes
and did not recall any details of the hallway, except that
there was a radiator there: E
l= As -ABIDIAN's case officer, NOSENKO recalled re-
ceiving the surveillance report of his visit to the
Pushkin Street building and placing this report in
ABIDIAN's. file. (This is the case file which NOSENKO’

turned over to his successor, GRYAZNOV, about 28-28 December
“ 1961, just before he transferred to the Tourist Department.)

~ NOSENKO received no written reports on the results
of the stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss
this matter with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during
the first month of surveillance, periodically after that. =
These discussions took place either by telephone, or when
KOZLOV was visiting NOSENKO's office, or when NOSENKO
visited KOZLOV's office in KGB Headquarters. From KOZLOV
or perhaps someone else, NOSENKO learned that the post had
been discontinued after 90 days. On the basis of these
conversations with KOZLOV, NOSENKO knew that nothing of
interest occurred during the period of the stationary sur-
veillance,
8

~ NCSENKO was in the U.3. Embassy Section during all
the period thatthe statipnary_susveillance-post—wes—wateh=—— asia
H ing the Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard
from KOZLCV that the post had been replaced by periodic }
inspections. i

- NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance
on the Pushkin Street dead drop site to his CIA contacts
in Geneva in June 1962 because the post had already been
discontinued by this time without anything unusual or sus-
picious having been noted. Therefore he thought that this
incident would not be particularly interesting to the CIA.

CIA records show that ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street
dead drop site only once, on 30 December 1961, a year later than
NOSENKO says, in response to an apparent signal from PENKOVSKIY.
The sequence of events was as follows: On 27 December 1961,
following receipt of what seemed to be the prearranged signal
from PENKOVSKIY that the drop had been loaded, Air Force Captain
Alexis DAVISON drove from his apartment to the U.S. Embassy to
alert ABIDIAN. At about 2100 hours the same night, ABIDIAN
left in his own car for Spasso House, the Ambassador's residence
where a dance was in progress, to tell the CIA Chief of Station,
Paul GARBLER, about the signal. ABIDIAN and GARBLER left Spasso
House with the other guests at akout 0200 on 28 December in
ABIDIAN's car and drove past the telephone pole where, as part
of his “drop loaded" signal, PENKOVSKIY was to leave a mark.
Later in the morning of 28 December, ABIDIAN, again in ‘his owm
car drove from the Embassy to DAZIDSON's apartment, ‘where he
chon -. first checked the telephone pple visually from the window and atid

then walked by it for a closer examination. Although it was

not certain that the telephone calls received on 27 December .

had, ‘in fact, keen a signal from PENKOVSKIY and although no
supplementary mark was found on the telephone pole, a decision
was reached to check the drop. Therefore, at 1115 on 30 Decem-
ber 1961, ABIDIAN with Julian F. MacDONALD, an Embassy Economics
Officer, left the Embassy in an official car with a Soviet
@river and proceeded to a bogqkstere on the corner of Pushkin
Street. At 1130 ABIDIAN entered the building where the drop
site was located, determined that the drop was empty, and
* left one minute later.. The pair then returned to the Embassy. -

<@hese facts were outlined tp NOSENKO during the February
1965 interrogation: It was pointed out that, by his own. most

sh aah



Pe

recent account, NOSENKO had transferred from the U.S. Embassy
Section to the Tourist Department about 28 December 1961 and
that his participation in a Tourist Department approach to
American citizen W. E, JOHNSON on 5 January 1962 had been con-
firmed by JOHNSON himself. Therefore, NOSENXO was told, much
of what he had told CIA about his own role in the Pushkin
Street affair became untenable. NOSENKO's response to this
observation is described in Part V.F.3., which discusses
NOSENKO's approach to JOHNSON,

Also during the February 1965 interrogaticns NOSENKO refused
to sign the page of a protocol which read as follows:

"I have been told by my interrogators that ABIDIAN's
only visit to the Pushkin Street site took place on 30 Dec-
ember 1961. Therefore, I was told that:

a. I coulé not have placed the surveillance

sense [report in ABIDIAN'S_case€ file pecatise I had_already. -
turned over the file to GRYAZIOV.

b. I could not have received reports about the
stationary surveillance while still DIAN's case
officer, since I was already in the Seventh Deparct-
ment in January 1962.

c. The three month period in which the sur-
veillance post was watching the Pushkin Street site
did not expire until 30 March 1962 - more than two
weeks after I left for Geneva.

Thus I could not have known in June 15€2 that the surveil.
lence of the dead drop site had failed to produce results
or that it had been discontinued.”

Although he acknowledged having reported to CIA on his involve-
ment with ABIDIAN as summarized in the protocol, NOSENKO said
the way in which the protecol was prepared made him “leok silly."
On no other occasion has NOSENKO refused to sign protocols
dealing with other subjects.

NOSENKO was questioned further during October 1966 concern-
ing ABIDIAN's visit-to Pushkin Street.  NOSENKO reaffirmed that
ABIDIAN was under special surve{llance coverage throughout his
Moscow tour and that this surveillance detected his travel from
the U.S. Embassy to Pushkin Street and back; he would date this
only as “sometime in 1961." NOSENKO was asked whether KGB sur-
veillance had detected any unugual movements by ABIDIAN during
the period just preceeding his visit to the PENKOVSKIY drop
site (a reference to hisi movements on 27 and 28 December 1961
as described above). He replied that he knew definitely that
surveillance had reported nothing unusual and added that
ABIDIAN had not succeeded in losing the KGB surveillance at
any time during this period. 4

On 20 October 1966 NOSENKO was asked why, in his opinion,

ABIDIAN had gone to Pushkin Street at the time he did. In re-

ponse, he told CIA for the first time that in about.1960 an

Sines!

a wai



“American tourist or delegation member had gone to the Pushkin ©
Street address and that it was the “opinion of the Second Chief
Directorate” that this American had selected it as a dead drop
site,* it was thought that ABIDIAN. went there merely to check
the suitability of the. proposed site.

When he was asked on 20 October 1966 whether he had visited
the Pushkin Street address several days after ABIDIAN had been
seen there, as he had earlier said, NOSENKO replied: "I don't
remember. I do not want to say that I visited the dead drop. 1
don't remember now whether I visited it or not. It seems to me
that I visited it, but I don't remember. It seems that I visited
it with KOZLOV, but I cannot say ‘yes,’ and I cannot say ‘no,'"

As previously indicated, NOSENKO said that on the seme day
AEIDIAN was observed on Pushkin Street (i.e., on 30 December
1961) the Chief of the KGB Surveillance Directorate, KOZIOV,
inspected the Pushkin Street building, The FBI had reported,

however, that KOZIOV was on TOY in the United States from

15 November 1961 until leaving New York City on 30 December

1361, travelling via France. The timing of ABIDIAN's visit to
Pushkin Street, at 0330 hours New York City (Eastern Standard).
time, would appear to preclude the possibility of KOZLOV's having
gore to the dead drop site on the Gay NOSENKO said he did.

*" The Pushkin Street dead drop site was proposed by PENKOV-
SKIY himself in the August 1960 letter by which he initi-
ally contacted CIA. .The only known visits by Americans to
this address and the only. ones connected with its use as a
dead drop location occurréd on 12 November and 4 December
1960, when CIA officer Eugene MAHONEY checked the address
from the outside, and on 21 January 1961; when MAHONEY

" Feturned and entered the building to check the precise
idead drop location. See Part V.E.3.f.. for a discussion

e. Supervisor of Activities Against American Service Attaches

At the beginning of the interrogation session. on 29
January 1965, NOSENKO was asked to list the duties he as=-
sumed upon reporting to the U.S, Embassy Section in Jan-

1969, As he had on a number of earlier occasions,
NOSENKO replied that he was given responsibility for the
supervision of code clerk operations, was made the KGB
case officer for Americen Security Offices John ABiDIAN
who was to arrive in the near future, and was charged i
with the Second Chief Directorate file on the security of :
the U.S. Embassy and his section's file cn the materiace
from microphones in various Exbassy officea. Later in
this same session NOSEKKO recailed--and toid CIA-for the
first time--that he was also given the duty of supervising
activities against officers assigned to the U.S..Arny,

Navy, and Air Force Attache offices. The pertinent
portion of the 29 January 1965 interrogatica was as fol- -
ows

‘Quéstion: Who briefed you or gave you instructions on

what was expected of you in the Section?
NOSENKO: I was speaking with GRIBANOV and KLYPIN.
Questions What did KLYPIN say?

NOSENKOs That “you are Deputy Chief of Section, but I feet
consider that you must also pay special atten~ i
tion to code clerks. We must study them and
make an approach to one of then. It's necessary
to work on this." KOVSEUK was in KLYPIX's
office and I remember also that he raised the
question: "O.K. He will supervizce this kind
of work, but maybe he can also take tne military.
All three attach “ Well, KUYPIN did not say
yes and dic not say no. I couldn't say anything
because I had not begun; I didn't know how zuch
work this would involve, I couldn't say. And,
you see, KLYPIN said: “Let's try it a short.
period of time.” It was that way. It was

. decided that I:will supervise the code clerks
and then the three attaches. And KOVSHUK took
the diplomats and a whole pile of work. But,

.. @£ course, in the absence of KOVSHUK I nust aeeeeesertaens peers

any papers, to KOVSHUK. You see, there was
such a division [of labor].

Questions Am I correct that by military attaches you

NOSENKOs Yes.
Questions Attaches and their assistants?

NOSENKOt Yes, yes, yes.

Question: And enlisted persSnnel? ee

NOSENKO: DEMKIN was handling enlisted perscrnel, and he
was also coming in to me for advice.

Question: Roughly how long dia you have the responsibil-
ities for the attaches?

NOSENKO?s (pause) I don't remember. Several months.
Questions By several, you meanss.?
NOSENKOs Five or six.

Question: And why was this responsibility removed from
you?

NOSENKOr: I didn’t have time. No time, No time. You see,

were too many other questions whiches.

Questions What occupied most of your time?

NOSENKO:, Day-to-day matters. An order from the Chief of

something to prepare for GRIBANOV, then some

NOSENKOs eeeGAVRILENKO had the Air Force attaches and
assistants; KURILENKO had the Army Attache and
assistants; and BELOGLACOV the Naval Attache,
assistants and marines.**

During interrogations on 20 October 1966, NOSENKO
chanced his earlier statement that the only operational
file he held in the U.S. Embassy Section was that on
ABIDIAN. At the same time, he described a leave period
that he had not mentioned earlie: NOSENKO said: "When
I began to work [in the U.S. Embassy Section], after a
month or so, I took the files on the Naval Attaches. And

EHOSENRO had mentioned this earlier, on 18 June 1564 he was
| edesssnencazesenzona asked to list the names and functions of U.S. Embassy Sec~ be

tion officers in 1960. He said: “In 1960 the Chief of the
First Department was KLYPIN. .MATVEYEV was still there as
First Deputy. The Second Deputy was, Yevgeniy Nikolayevich *
_ ALESHIN, He was:given the special assignzent of coordina-~
: ting the activities of the Second Chief Directorate. against
Heat _ all foreign military intelligence activity but was assigned
to. the First Department... In the First Section, KOVSHUK
was the Chief and I was the Deputy Chief. ‘In addition to
+, general functions, I had the responsibility for supervising
the work against code clerks and the Embassy Security Officer.”
@@ In June 1964 NOSENKO explained that Nikolay DRANOV wag re-
gponsible for the Naval Attache's office in January: when
WOSEWKO. arrived, but he was. transferred and his duties were
taken over by BELOGLAZOV who had: been working ‘with him
against this target. : é



then after two months I gave them to BELOGLAZOV. I im-
mediately went on vacation after I came.* After two weeks
I went on leave for a month, I took over the files either
before or after the leave.“** NOSENKO was asked why he
had assumed responsibility only for the Naval Attaches and
replied: It was decided by KOVSAUK. I should take only:
the Navy while I was gettiag acquainted with the section.
At the same time, the case officer DRANOV was retiring and
he handled only Naval officers. I didn't take the Army

or Air Force.*

NOSENKO was asked again on 25 October 1966 why he
was responsible only for the Naval Attaches during early
1960. He answered; “I took the files only on the Navy,

but I was working on all of them,”

¥7Yn other contexts NOSENKO has ‘always equated custody

of a file with case officer responsibilities. There-

_ fore, he seems to have indicated here that for the
approximately two months when these files were in his
name, he was officially the KGB case officer charged
with the American Naval Attaches.
During a subsequent interrogation sei sion, NOSENKO was
asked to describe the leaves he took during 1960 and
1961, He repeated that he took a ronth’s leave im
mediately upon joining the U.S. Embassy Section, “part
of January and part of February” 1960; He had gone,
he said, to the Caucasus with his wife and mather. He
then added: “You want me to say I was not telling the
truth in February [1965] when I said I was on leave be~
fore I want to Cuba [in q - this.

», Knowledge of the Target
{i)

240.

Introduction

_/ His position and duties as Yeputy Chief and sonetimes
Acting Chief gave NOSENKO access to, and required hin to
know, the extent of. the U.S, Embassy Section's knowledge

of
by

its target. He has therefore been questioned at length
CIA about the locations and cccupents of the Embascy

offices as well as about the Embassy personnel whom the KGB
had identified as CIA officers. ‘The information from
ROSENKO on these two topics is presented below,

(ii) Physical Premises

NOSENKO has said that tis knowledge of the physical

layout of the Embassy cerives both from his gencral super@

visory function during 1960 and-196% and from hfs respon=

. sibilities as the officially registerad custodian of the
KGB's file on the security of the Embassy. According to
NOSEMKO, he received the latter from his chief, KOVSHUK,
when ke arrived in the section in January 1960; shortly
thereafter he arranged by a phone call to the Secretariat

of

the Second Chief Directorate to have custody transferred

officially to his name from that of M.F. BAXHVALOV, his
predecessor as Deputy Chief of Section, NOSENKO explained

that

BAKHVALOV had already left the section by this time

but that, under KGB prcce-lures, it was permissivle for an
officer to rezain official custodian of a file belonging

to

the U.S. Embassy Section, even after leaving the American

Department, 80 long as he remained in the Seccnd Chief
Directorate. Until he turned this file over to GRYAZNOV
approximately during the pariod 25 to 28 December 1961, no
one else had access to it other than KOVSHUK, Chief of the
section, and GRYAZNOV and KCSOLAPOV, who shared the office
and safe where this file was kept.

NOSENKO stated in February 1965 that he had never

studied the contents, nor had he paid any special attention

to

this file, Since he would necessarily have been in a

position to know, NOSENKO also said he is certain that no

ope

ational analysis or planning by himself cr others was

done on the basis of this file during his two years in the
section, The file consisted of two volumes, one for the old
building on Mokhovaya Street and the second~~about one inch
thick--concerning the new Embassy building on Chaykovskiy
Street, which was occupied in 1953. It was used only for

ref

nce purposes, for the’ KGB had concluded that it was
ible for a Soviet citizen to penetrate’ the secure

impo:

areas, of the Embassy because.cf the security precautions in

effect. Apart from these file-custodial duties, NCSENKO was

generally interested in the floor plans of. the’ Embassy .by
_wirtue of his position as Deputy Chief of the section.
WOSENKO's knowledge of the Embassy premises is reflected in
the CIA debriefing of February 1965, and these statements ~

were carefully questioned on what they saw, because these,
areas were of special interest to the KGB. NOSENKO knew
no KGB employees who entered the secure areas curing

1960 or 1961 and had no personal contact with any of them.
He did not remenber any information that such KGB employees
ever reperted to the KGB, except that Dmitriy I. KUKOLEV,
an electrician whom he personally handled in 1954-1955,
had observed antenna wiring in the attic; the details or
significance of the wiring were unknown to NOSENKO as of
1965.

NOSENKO personally pzaced some reports by KGB agents
in the Embassy security file while he had custody of it,
None of the infcrmation, he said, was interesting, im-
portant, or useful enouch for nim to remember, and he
could not name the’. agent sources of the KGB, In another
context and at another time, however, NOSENKO said he
had received a report from some agent (name unknown)
that there was a sign “Security Office" on the office

“door of John V. ABIDIAN, the Embassy Security Officer.*

NOSENKO did not study the Enbassy security pro-
cedures in detail and did not remexber where the classified
trash wes burnec., He said that notning could be done with
this information operationally, because the tresh was 4l-
ways burned by a U.S. sergeant or a Marine guard ac@-
companied by an officer.**

The Embassy office or floor where any section was
located or any individual worked during the years 1960
and 1961 was not remexbered by NOSENKO, This reply was
also given when he was asked about tha roons and floors
for the offices of the ambassador, the political officers,
ABIDIAN, and the code clerks.*** NOSENXO said that he
either knew these locations at the time he was Deputy
Chief of the section or could have found them in the
in the monthly Embassy phone lists; the KGB received these
regularly from agent sources, and the lists gave office
numbers and phone numbers.****

To never has been such a sign) NOSENAO’s xesponai-~
bility for the KGB coverage of ABIDIAN is discussed
in, Part V.E.3.d.. All Soviets who enter the top three
floors of the Embassy have a marine escort. f
#@ A check with two former Embassy security officers in-
@icates that there has never been such a regulation.
The trash is burned by the marine on duty who "in-
variably does it alone.“ One of the security officers
questioned said: “I can think of no reason why the Sov=
fets would think this to be the casé, since whatever
collateral information they have on it would point to
; the truth."
*@ Part V.E.3.c. reviews NOSENKO's knowledge of and parti-
eipation in KGB operations against U.S. code clerks.
© The telephone lists give only phone numbers, not office
- numbers, They do, however, provide apartment numbers.



242,

In 1960 a “metallic chamber® (acoustical room) arrived
at the Embassy for Predident Eisenhower's use-and for
secret conversations. NOSENKO was not certain where it was
located or whether it was ever used, but he heard from an
unknown source that in 1960-1961 meetings were held in a
secure room in the "Zone of Security.” He did nct know any se
of the technical details of this room. 7

The KGB accomplished only one theft of classified
material in any form from the U,S. Embassy durirg 1960
and 1961. A charwoman (name or cryptonym not recalled),
who worked as an agent for the KGB officer Viktor BELOG-
LAZOV, stole a bag of papers from the office cf the Naval
Attaches. Most of the papers were turn or crumpled, They
included a draft of a report of the Naval Attaches’ sighting
of ships and factories while on a trip to Leningrad. Since
this report was of only routine interest to the KGB, NOSENKO
: -. aid, he was unable to recall any other details of the theft,
ne + including the date, except that tle charwoman was granted
@ cash award, .

(iii) CIA Personnel Under Embassy Cover

According to NOSENKO, the Americans at the U.S. Embassy :
of graatest counterintelligence interest to the KGB section -
were the identified CIA officers. When questioned on 2-
Septerber 1964 concerning his knowledge of intelligence por-
sonnel assigned to the Embassy in 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO
stated that the KGB immediately Listed any officer associated
with the offices of U.S. Armed Forces Attaches as a member
of American Military Intelligence and any diplomat.as “suspect
American Intelligence," the latter nctation always meaning
CIA. One of the tasks of the section was to determine which
of these diplosats was the CIA “Resident” (KGB nomenclature
for. Chief of Station), which were CIA case officers, and
which were the CIA agents or cooptees. The KGB knew that 2
code clerks would not be used to fulfill intelligence missions
and that the same probably held true for the Ambassador and
the Marine guards. NOSENKO cn 25 February 1965 signed a pro-
,tocol which included his statement that, as Deputy Chief and
occasional Acting Chief of the section, he would “necessarily
know whom the KGB knew or suspected to be a CIA officer in the
Embassy." .

NOSENKO has been shown lists of the names of all
«-. American personnel assigned to the embassy during 1960 and
1961 and on a nunber of occasions has been asked to select
those known or suspected by the KGB to be CIA office
persons he so identified, together with his comments con-
cerning them were: +

KLOSSON was considered as such but said: "Every officer :

Resident." KLOSSON may have taken David MARK's job,

HOSENKO said, and MARK had been suspected of being the
CIA Resident on the basis of his behavior under KGB..

operations against BOWDEN, lists several reasons why he

as FBI on later occasions also. See Part VI.De7.c. on

~- Richard FUNKHOUSER: Suspected cf being a CIA
officer because he is a specialist on the Soviet Union,
particularly economics. NOSFNKG did not remember the
names of any agents working against FUNKHOUSER nor any
derogatory information concerning him.

- William HORBALY: Suspected of being a CIA case
officer* because the KGB heard h by means of micro- ‘
phones in the Embassy, discussiny a report he had
written, or dictating it, about his cbservations on
a trip he had taken in the Soviet Union. NOSENKO said
that he did not know the names cf agents working
against MORBALY or ther the agents obtained deroga-
tory information concerning him. As far as NOSENKO
knew, there had been no operaticnal eeerace to or
recruitment. of HORBALY.

NOSENKO as known or suspected CIA pezconnel tiree=-WINTERS, :
and HORBALY--were in fact CIA officers. When :

Was first assigned to Moscos, however, he was ‘
detached from overt employment as an economics analyst in
CIA. In January 1962 he severed his connecticns with CIA
to become a full member of the Foreign Agricultural Ser-
vice of tha Department of Agricult . When HORBALY first
arrived in Moscow he openly discus the fact that he had come
to the Embassy from CIA. While in cow he nad no connection
with or knowledge of CIA clandestine activities. was
similarly detached from overt employment as an economic analyst
with CIA when he was assigned to Mcscow, but was coopted by
CIA for limited operational support activity, chiefly mailing
agent letters. After his return from Moscow ke reverted to
his overt CIA employment. John ABIDIAN was a State Department
officer coopted by CIA; although not a CIA staff employee, he
was for all intents the CIA "Resident" in Moscow from Febru-
ary 1960 until November 1961. The remaining three-~-KLOSSON,
BOWDEN and FUNKHOUSER--had no affiliation with CIA.

KGB before their arrival in the Soviet Union. In addition,
one officer (William MORELL) was openly identified as a CIA
employee to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs before
arriving in Moscow. Furthermore, Francis STEVENS (see Page
374) reported having been.asked by one of the two KGB offi-
cers trying to recruit him whether MORELL was a CIA employee;
when STEVENS replied that he did not know, the KGB officer
stated: “He openly says he does." Another officer (G. Stan=

George BLAKE, the KGB penecration of ¥I-6, was arrested
in London on 14 April 1961. In his confession he said that
he had passed the KGB a master list of the names of persons

conn: d with the joint U.S.-British project with which
(eens been connnected in Frankfurt, as well es other
Ss on this project. On this basis, as
relieved shortly thereafter of further duties connected with
support of the PENKOVSKIY operation; he was withdrawn fron
Moscow in September 1961, less than a year after his arrival.

CIA records indicate that GARBLER was detailed to CIA

ivy in April 1952 and served
from January 1953 until July 1955.” In the fall
x 2 he resigned his naval commission, and in May 1956

On 3 June 1961, he returned to active duty with the Navy,
and on 31 August 1961 his appointment was announced as
Assistant Naval Attache to SMescow, with the rank of Commander.
if . In September 1961 his official biographic data was forwarded
} to the office of the Soviet Naval Attache in Washington, who
: had requested this information, and the same month GARBLER
made an official call at the Soviet Embassy. GARBLER arrived
in Moscow on 29 November 1961. He was the CIA Chief of
Station there.

Prior to his affiliation with CIA, GARBLER served in
Korea and there was acquainted with George BLAKE. In April

« 1960 GARBLER was a participant in joint CIA-MI-6 discussions

+: in Washington on-the question of tourist operations into

‘the Soviet Union (see Part V.D.8); BLAKE, who had access

to information on the. agenda and participants for these. talks,
admitted after his. arrest in 1961 that he had photographed
the minutes of: this meeting and had passed them to his. Soviet
handlers. On this basis CIA presumed that GARBLER_vas
identified to. the KGB prior to arriving in Moscow at the

a

end of 1961. (BLAKE was arrested the previous April.) He
was definitely identified as such in an article carried in

the Soviet Government newspaper Izvestiya in October 1963.

This article, entitled “A Cruel Lesson. “was allegedly
written by Arthur HANAN, an Estonian wno defected to the
West in 1955 and returned to the Soviet Union in 1963; in
it HAMAN attempted to expose how “the U.S, Secret Service,
riding roughshod over Swedish sovereignty. recruits agents
for subversion and espionage against the Soviet Union and
other countries...making active use of the official U.S.
missions in Stockholm, newsmen, tourists..." HANAN named
GARBLER as having been involved in. th work. ‘This article,
which appeared at about the same time as the arrest of:
WENNERSTROW, dese ribed a number of fabricated activities
of CIA in Sweden and, in fact, GARBLER had no connection
with HANAN or with anything which HANAN describes. *

g- Electronic Operations Against the U.S. Esabassy
(4) Introduction i

NOSENKO had. three basic pieces of information on KGB
audio and other electronic operations against the U.S. Em-
bagsy in Moscow: The presence of microphones in the
chancery building, the absence of audio-technical devices
in the north wing of the Embasay, and the existence of a
beam which monitors and jams transmissions from the Embassy.
Thesé are discusced separately below. Except for knowing
that a resonant cavity (wireless) ‘microphone had been found
in the American Ambassador's residence in 1953, NOSENKO :
said he was unaware of audio surveillance devices and tech- *
niques (other than the chancery microphones) in use against :
the Embassy, nor did he know of any material produced by
such measures. NOSENKO told CIA on 14 May 1964 that, to,

“the bést of his knowledge, there were no wireless micro-. i

phones (i.e., carrier transmitters and radio transmitters)

in the Embassy.* His information on KGB electronic opera.

tions against this target dated mainly from the period when :
he was Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, American

Department, KGB Second Chief Directorute, in 1960-1961 and 4
derives from his special responsibilities in this period;

from his 1953-1955 service in the American Department, NO-
SENKO said, he learned only that audio installations
existed.

(41) Microphones in the Chancery

Frequently described by NOSENKO as his most important
information, the microphones in the chancery building were
first mentioned by him during the 1962 meetings in Geneva.

_ In these and subsequent debriefings NOSENKO reported in de-

“tail on the ways in which he acquired this information, on
the number and locations of the microphones, the quality of
reception, and the value of production. He has not given
the date when the. microphones became operative, but pre-
sumed (in agreement with the KGB defector GOLITSYN) that
they Were installed prior to 1953, when the chancery was oc-
ecupied by U.S. Government representatives.** Of the 16
microphones listed by NOSENXO, he has stressed the impor-
tance of the one in the office of the Minister Counsellor,
the existence of which was earlier reported by GOLITSYN and
subsequently confirmed by technical investigations. In
1962 NOSENKO said that the audibility of the nine-year-old

*NOSENKO stated that the KGB knew the identity of American
counter-audio technicians and therefore turned off the micro-
phones whenever any of them arrived at the Embassy. Since
—a@ microphone. \-wire system cannot be turned off, this re-
- mark suggests either that there was an external power source
for the microphones, which NOSENKO has not mentioned, or
that NOSENKO himself aia not have rudimentary knowledge of

the investigations by. American technicians leave 20 doubt
that the aicrophone-snd-wire system would bave had: to be

system varied from very clear‘to zcro; he said in 1964
that the quality was detertorating and that “in a year or
two they ftne microphones| will be completely inoperative."*
Althougk the microphones produced a great deal of politi-

' cal intelligence, NOSENKO said, -he found nothizg worthwhile
for use against U.S. code clerks or others. of operational
interest to him.*# All pertinent details from NOSENKO and
other sources on the microphone systen in the chancery
biilding is presented in the follwing portions of this
paper. A

(a) NOSENKO's Sources ;

Nearly all of NOSENKO's knowledge about the micropkone
system in the chancery building was, he said, derived from
two circumstances: Fitst, his responsibility as Deputy
~ i Chief of the KGB's U.S. Embassy Section, for receiving and
i 4 disseminating transcripts of conversations there; and second,
a special meeting which he attended in his dual capacity as
Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section and custodian of
the microphone information. Additional information was ob=
tained by NOSENKO in 1962 and 1963 trom G.I, GRYAZNOV, his
former subordinate and his successor as Deputy Chief of the
Section. In several discussions with GRYAZNOV dufing this
period NOSENKO learned that some of the microphones were
dead while others had become less efficient since NOSENKO's t
reassignment to the Tourist Department in Junuary 1962. i
NOSENKO's statements concerning his major sources’ 6f infor-
mation on the microphones are presented in chronological
order below. !

“We are listening to everything the military attaches
say in Moscow, the Military, Navy and Air Force Attaches,"
<. NOSENKO said on 11 June 1962. “All the reports go through
me. I read them....Only a limited group of people read
these reports. They are all in the First Department of the

with this: function which is called the Second Special
Department. It is a part of the Operationai Technical
Directorate [OTU]. The Special Department has several
sections within it. Take, for example, the section under
Colonel [N.¥a.] KUZMIN. He has the entire English line,
everything. He has young girls.and boys there who have an
excellent command of English. They all sit in a room with
special equipment and listen continuously. Besides this,
everything goes on tape and later they transcribe it. They
listen to it two or three times so as to get every word....
[They prepare the matcrials.| The materials from the
American Enbassy used to come to me...and I decided what to
keep and what not to kecp. why? A summary report would
come to ne with the notation that the information in it

was Top Secret or Confidential. This was all nonsense, but-
I was required to return the report within two days' time.-
So, I would read through the materials to sce what was use-
ful and what was not.. It's not all suitable. And 1 would
underline this [the significant items] with a pencil. No,
{1 was wrong!.t'The report first went to the thicf of de-
partment and then I underlined with a pencil what was neces-
sary and gave it back to them [the Second Special Department,
OTU}. They collected it. I signed a receipt that I had
received it from them and they gave me a receipt when I
returned it. And then they gave me extracts. From these
extracts alcne one cannot tcll where the material cawe from,
but from the report one realizes that the Americans are i
being listened to. It is necessary to have these extracts
to place in the files. We have a file on each person working
in the Embassy, the so-called delo-formulyar [developmental
file]. We keep one on every Embassy employee."

During the second of the 1964 series of meetings in
Geneva, on 24 January, NOSENKO took a number of notes from
his wallet. Pointing to. one of them, he said: "This piece
of paper was kept in my operational file and it represents
the statistics for the years 1960-1961, listing those micro-
phones which are actively used in monitoring conversations
in the U.S. Embassy." This list named eleven offices and
apartments in the chancery which contained microphones.
When asked whether he had copied the list from records or
had.drawn it up from memory, NOSENKO explained that it came
from an operational review of what “listening points we had
in the U.S. Embassy." :

A detailed explanation of his acquisition of the written

"List was supplied by NOSENKO on 14 May 1964:

Question: How did this list come into your hands? What
————~___ caused you to write it? : :
NOSENKO. I came to KLYPIN [Chief of the American Depart-
———. ment] with my working notebook. KOVSHUK [Chief

_ of-the U.S. Embassy Section in the Department]

“, Was writing and he put the list on my book.
KOVSHUK said this one [microphone] is working
well, this one badly, and so on. Repeats

What was the date of this? What year and month?
Oh, I don't remember, 1960...maybe the beginning
of 196 aes

Yes... Or maybe it was at a meeting. It is dif-
ficult to say. Maybe we went to report to KOVSHUK
dn his room ur maybe KOVSHUK was. writing ip
KLYPIN’s study room. 1 don't remember.

NOSENKO then described the purpose of the neeting:. To dis-
cuss the possibility of releusing monitor positions from
some of the chancery microphones and of assigning these re-

. leased positions to. Vladimir. {patronymic unknown] PETROY, —
Chief of the American Department's section for work against
American tourists and delegates suspected of being con-
nected with American Intelligence; PETROV had earlicr re-
quested English-language monitoring positions from the Chief
of the English-Language Section of the OTU's Second Special
Department but had been told that all such interpreters were
already engaged on priority targets. At the neeting KOVSHUK
aiid KLYPIN reviewed the microphone. coverage of the chancery
to decide which rooms offered information of little value
and which monitoring positions Could-be released to PETROV.
KOYSHUK drew up a list of the Embassy offices and apartments
then being covered on a full-time basis and indicated those
of lesser importance. At the end of the meeting, KOVSHUK
gave the list to NUSENKO, who retained it in his safe until
bringing it to CIA in 1964. NOSENKO has added nothing fur-
ther on the locations of microphones in the chancery building,
and much of his information concerning the quality and value
of the production by these microphones cane from this
meeting. :

Since his defection, NOSENKU has spoken further on his
responsibilities in connection with the daily transcripts
received from the Second Special Yepartment. He said on
14 May 1964: “All the materials after they were read and
signed were returned to the Second {Special] Department of the
Operational Technical Directorate. Some of the material fron
this was put in the individual file, but anyone who read
it would never know where it came from. He wouldn't know
that it came from mikes....KOVSHUK und I read all of this.
From this we gave information to those who needed it, de-
pending on their interest. If there was something inter-
esting, it was given to KLYPIN to read. If KLYPIN saw
something interesting he could take it ‘and give it to GRI-
BANOV. Tatyana GRISHNYAT [from the Second Special Department]
came by car with this material. . She went to KLYPIN. Some~
times she left them with me."

A protocol signed by NOSENKO in 1965 states: "One of
my duties as Deputy Chief, First Section, First Department,
Second Chief Directorate, was to receive, review, and give
to appropriate case officers the production from microphones
dn the American Embassy on a daily basis. I also maintained
the control book (journal) for these trarscripts. These
transcripts were prepared by the Operational Technical Direc-
“ -torate of the KGB. Every day a female worker of the OTU
brought me the transcripts of conversations in the Embassy
from the previous day. I regularly returned all of. the ori-
“*ginal transcripts to this female worker; they were usual]:

of the section and received this information. I decided
what to give the Chief of Pepartment and what not to give
him, Bo you understand? This is to say nothing about the
other departments and the [U.S.i Embessy Section itself."

12 June 1962: “We lost the microphone in the private

residence Of fie Ambassador. This was not THCMPSON, but the

A one before him, BOHLEN was there then. We once had some=

1 thing there, but you found the [Ureat] Seal where it was

his office and dictates. All this is recorded. Well, this
is important material."

* 14 June 1962: "When I was Deputy Chief of the American
EmbasSy Section T received reports on the microphone material
daily. If there was something important in it, I reported
to the Chief of the department. The rest KOVSHUK and I
read and then distributed to the workers the parts that con-
cerned them. Well, the workers who were operating against
the three attaches knew about this [microphone] equipment....
Nothing was received from the code room. These machines
were working and there were no conversations. He was sitting
alone and there was nothing. [NOSENKO is evidently describing
the military code room.]....There is a point there from which
we hear the Agricultural Attache. But there in nothing
there. They talk about what interests them in the field of

. agriculture. Nothing interesting.”

24 January 1964: The late 1960/early 1961 list which
KOSENKO brought to CIA (see above) showed that the following
offices and apartments in the chancery contained microphénes:

of eleven listening posts.” (in dis sing the late 1960

or early 196i meeting at which KGVSKUK and KLYPI’ received
the wicrophose coverage, NOSENKO said on 14 May 1044 that

it was decided to celeas. the mierophone positions in the
GLEYSTEEN office, tne ECRBATY-BROWN office, the State De~
partment code room and the teictype office. ihis would
leave a total of cight ‘listening posts.")

14 May 1964: Questioned on the total number of micro
phones th the U.S. Ecbassy, SOSHNKO said that "mary" were
Vastalled in the chamery building before the Americans moved
jn, but that he did not know how many were instailed in all,
how many wege in any one of the rooms included in KOVSHUK'Ss
list, or where they were lo.ated in specific rooms. Ife
did recall that nost of the microphones were placed in the
outside wall, tke wall reavest Caaykovskiy Street, as most of
the offices faced tnis stre-t and the piacement of the micro-
phones near th: outer #all would mak it more difficult for
American technicians to find them if they examined only the

inner walls.

January 1965: NOSENKO volunteered that there were no
@ixedmicrophonés in America House, the residence of enlisted
men at the U.S, Embassy in Moscow. He said that there was
discussion during 1960 and 1961 of using the KCB agents
employed there to place temporary audio devices for one or
tvo days at a time in the rooms of the Americans as well as
in the Embassy garage. ‘These plans were vetoed, however, be-
cause such devices are too easily found. For the same rea—
gon, NOSENKO said, there was no attempt made in this period
to place temporary devices in Spasso House (the Ambassador's
wesidence) or in the apartments of sucn Enbassy officers
os John ABIDIAN. The KGB was "afraid that they vill be
éetected and that there will be a scandal.”

surveillance in the U.S. Eubassy -had been n placed. While
GOLITSYN was in the office, the Chief of the American De~ |

partment ordered all personnel present to search’ for these
papers, and all the KGB officers searched again through
their files, without success. GOLITSYN noted a large’ num
ber of reports with red stripes across their covers, indi- -
cating that they were the property of the Operational Tech-
nical Directorate, The only office in the U.S, Embassy that
GOLITSYN recalled being mentioned in connection with this
soarch was that of the Minister Counsellor.*

chancery building for the presence of microphones in the
spring of 19 The results have been described in the
damage report submitted by the USIB Security Committee on
7 October 1964: "On 23 April 1964, a low-impedance dynamic
microphone and associated seven-inch probe tube were dis-
covered in the wall behind a radiator in Room 1008 of the
Chancery of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The cuble to this
rderophone was traced to a major cable run which lay several
inches under the outside surface of the cast face of the
Chancery. This major cable run consisted of a single
twenty (20) pair and a single thirty (30) pair, lead~sheathed
audio cable which ran along the cast face of the Chancery
to the reof area of the North Anz of the Embassy. At
this point, these cables were spliced into A one hundred and
one (101) pair cable along with two ten. (10). pair cables...
A number of vertical cables were found to run from the ten,
twenty, and thirty pair cabies to the various microphone
installations. Fifty (50) microphones h. been positively
identificd.+* Two (2) microphones not physically located

*0n 28 January 1965 NOSENKO volunteered an account of the j
loss of one of the intercept reports which the U.S. Embassy
Section had received from the Second Special Department of
the Operational Technical Directorate “in 1960 or 1961."
This document, according to NCSENKO, was “one of the reports
with [Minister Counscllor|] FREERS dictating"; as 2 result of
its loss, "the month of December, the whole month, the U.S.
Embassy Section was in a turmoil" searching for the document.
The month-long search and investigation was unsuccessful, :
however, and, in the end, the case was closed with the con- H
clusion that the document had probably been burned inadver-
tently, without a record of destruction having been drawn up.
In this account NOSENKO appears to date the incident in Decen~
ber 1960, which approximates GOLITSYN's secend series of -
visits to the U.S. Embassy Section (and duplicated GOLITSYN's i\
i
1

erroneous estimate of when these visits took place). NOSENKO
has never reported that GOLITSYN was present in the offices

of the U.S. Embassy Section during the search for this docu-
ment and, in fact, has denied that GOLITSYN visited the section
either im the spring of 1960 or in late 1960 or January 1961.
The ‘only visit by GOLITSYN to the U.S. Embassy Section reported ||

can reasonably be presumed to be in apartment 6J based on
the symmetry of the known installations. The microphones
located were situated so that all microphones and probes
were behind radiators. The microphone system discovered
covered every outside room on floors six through ten, with
the exception of those offices with dcors entering onto
balconies and when exterior building constructions were ad-
Jjacent to cutside wall sections bearing radiators."

The first microphone found was in Room 1608, in what
is pow the Army Finance office and which in 1960-1961 was
the office of the Military Attache, where NOSENKO reported
a microphone to be. All othor microphones were ultimately
traced fron this discovery. There were microphones in all
rooms identified by NOSENKO, and in others besides, Two of
the latter were tnoperative when found- in to Ambassa-
dor's office where NOSENKO said no conversations were being
heard in 1960-1961 and theother in the Security Office where
NOSENKO enid there wes none. The damage report concluded
that all the microphones were installed before the U.S
Government took possession of the chancery builuing in 1953.

NOSENKO made the following evaluations of the quality
of intercept received from the chancery microphone itustalla- i
tions: i

11 June 1962: "They are dying. the microphones, and i
we cannot do anything about it, because we can't get into :
the Embassy {to make new installations}. In that respect i
your Embassy and the british Embassy are the only cnes we
can't get into.”

14 June 1962: "The most interesting materials, of
course, ere irom the...[Note: one or tvo words or the tape
are unintelligible here: from earjier and subsequent remarks,
particularly one on 24 January 1964 (see below), it is clear
that NOSENKO is speaki1g of the microphone in the Minister
Counsellor's office.}| And I trll you honestly that it is
becoming increasingly difficult to work with this.
shayba fmicrophone;, as ve call them, is fading ard only two
or three people are able to make out what is being said.
That is, the tape sounds as if somewhere far, far away,
somewhere in the cellar, someone is speaking in a whisper.
It is very difficult to hear, very difficult when it ts
fading. But, what can you do? They tell us categorically
and directly--KUZMIN, the Chief of the section of the Second
Special Departnent responsible for this, tells us that
soon we will not have anything there. There are a great
nunber of microphon-s there, but they don't work. I know
that there are about 20 microphones there that don't work.
They have all gone deaf."

24 January 1964: “Now, we also listened to the code
room and the teletype office, but we could never get any~
thing out of the teletype office because of interference
probably speaking of machine noiso|. Fron this point

pointing at the list, but not stating which microphone he
was speaking about] the reception became progressively
weaker until it finally stopped: evideatly it wore out.
Yes, there was another point in the bar on the 8th floor.
This one never worked even though it was installed. Thus,
out of the eleven points, nine were working...[NOSENKO then ‘
referred to information he learned in 1962 and 1963, after i
leaving the U.S. Embassy Section.] GRYAZNOV said that the '
equipment is deteriorating and they are only getting snatches |
of conversation and that in a year or two they will be com- i ;
letely inoperative. GRIBANOV is insisting on getting to

[recruiting? code clerks at all costs.”

7? 2-91 January:1964: “Here in HORBALY's and BRO#N's room
office of the Agricultural Attaches], there is no acoustical
sic} and nothing comes from here. I'11 come back to this,
but they complained that they're not getting anything. [These
microphones were installed] when this building was being
built. It wasn't later after you had moved into the building,
but when the building was under construction...[NOSENKO was
asked whether more or fewer than nine microphones are now'scur-
rently active.] It couldn't be more, anyhow."

14 May 1964: Very interesting information wes heard
from Hinister Counsellor FREERS' office, NOSENKO said, "but

difficult to hear. I was sitting with [S.G.] DMITRIYEV
{Deputy Chief of the English-language Section of the Second
Special Departzeat|] aad they toid me how difficult it was.
The mike was dying. Only very experienced interpreters
were sitting on this. They listened 10, 15, even 20 times
to the same place [on the tape]....{After 1961] GRYAZNOV
was telling me that they were getting xlmost nothing from
this point. [He said this] in 1962, 1963. I was thinking
you had given a command [had cautioned FREERS]. We were
getting almost nothing. I heard this from GRYAZNOV several
times in 1963, Thr. mikes were working not bad at all in
1960 and 1961 in the attache rooms--Navy, Air Force....

I don't know [how receptién was in 1962]. 1 know only that
GRYAZNOV was te%ling me in 1962 and 1963 that they were getting
little, little, and almost nothing. He said we are losing
everything. We have no naterials. We have little, little
pieces, but nothing...in general | from all of the micro-
phones]." NOSENKO then speculated that one reason for this
was the fact that the Americans in the Exbassy were not

saying anything significant, but he said he did not know

this to be the case. Speuking of the microphone in GLEYSTEEN'S
office, ke said: ‘Lhere was something heard. In 1960 and

1961 it was working { remember. Reception was good but

there was no secret information, The mike in HORBALY's

room was good in 1960 and 1961...,1960 and 1961--good re-
ception." According to NOSENKO, reception was good from

the State Department code and teletype room “only always

the sounds of [teletype] machines. In 1960 and 1961~-machines
only....Reception was good when convergation came through.

I don't know [bout reception in 1962 and 1963]....Reception
was good {from the military code room in 1950 and 1961."

On-site tests made by American technicians after the
1964 discoveries determined that the following microphones
in the chancery (the occupants listed are those as of Decen-
ber 1960) were inoperative or unintelligible, but the USIB
damage report emphasized that it had not been possible to
determine how long these microphones had neen inoperative:

~one microphone in the apartment of the senior Naval

Attache;

-three microphones in the apartment of the senior Air
Attache;

~one micrephone in the apartment of the Economic Counsel-
lor;

-the microphone in the office of the Publications Pro-
curement Officer;

tache;

1961) and the office of the Security Officer (where KOSENZO
has said oo microphone was installed).* On-site recordings
made from twelve selected micrcphones in 1964 indicate that
the microphone in the office occupied by the Minister Counsel-
lor in 1960 was capable of producing tapes of “high intelli-
gibility"’ as of 1964. The 1964 tests of the microphones in
the military and State Department code rooms in the office

of the Naval Attache also produced recordings of high inteili-~
gibility. As pointed out telov, however, the possible pro-
duction by the code room micrephonee would have been sharply
reduced by the installation of acousticri rcons during 1962.

*As noted in Part VI.D,3.e., NOSENKO reported that the U.S.

. Embassy officer Richard HARMSTONE did not report his havang

been approached by the KGB for recruitment in May 1959.
HARMSTONE did, in fact, report the spproach, and the report
was made in the office of the Security Officer.

11 June 1962: "Well, perhaps, there would be some kind

of fitness report [kharakteristika]. Sometizes there tho : y

Counsellor, FREERS, who was there before McSWEENEY, dict=ted 4

something; he said that so-and-so has such-and-such weak~ 4

nesses. We had not known that. We are listening to your i

military attathes there. We know where they intend to travel, i

what they want to find-out. Fe krow waat nachinery and what i

targets interest then--always....They chatter sonetimes.

Some of the things they say are surprisizg [from the point

of view of security]. They discuss, among other things,

where to go, what to see, what to take with them--electronic

equipment or not, And we are hunting for this electronic -

equipment end now have permissioa, if we are absolutely cer~

tain that one of your people is taking electronic apparatus

with him on an intelligence trip outsize Moscow, to teke it,

to steal it. We now have authorization to take any necessary

steps to steal it. Because you now have impmved your

equipment. We stole some equipment in Stalingrad in 1955,

but now you have better apparatus....Wnat do we do [when we

know the attaches are taking special.equipment;? Well, they

are getting ready to go and we hear that such-and-such data

interests them. We give them disinformation; we make them

think, for example, that there are rockets there. And there's

absolutely nothing there, understand? Absolutely nothing.

We make it appear on the radio [by spurious transmissions]

that there are rockets there; we even have patrols standing 4

there and everything....They talk about interesting things, |

but never in my life have I heard a conversation about agent 4
4
i

operations, not once."

12 June 196: [Speaking again about coverage of the U.S.
Servite Attaches “They say: Today, let's go to such-and-
such a place.' They go to the military attache, the two
assistants, and say: ‘This region is-interesting. They have
something there.* We know it at once. I personelly tele- ~
phone surveillance at once and tell the Chief of the depart—
ment to come at once. He arrives and I say: ‘Throw in
three, four, five brigades [surveillance teams].' We work 2l-
most openly against the attaches..,.}REERS, Bill FREERS, in
particular, walks around in his office and dictates, All
this is recorded. Well, this is very important material. We
do not know the cipher, but he dictates Top Secret and Con-
fidential cables [in the clear}. We receive the clear text
and decide at once whether there is anything serious there or
= pot. If we decide that this must be reported to the [KGB]

Chairman immediately, GRIBANOV may call him right away."

24. January 1964: "Now, we also listened to the code
‘goom End the teletype office, but we could never get anything
. Because of interference [teletype ‘machine noise}....We didn't
get much out of the [military] code room;..we. could hear [the
code clerk James] STORSBERG. swearing on occasion, and then
he would mention a group of numbers.* This was, ef course



all recorded, and wé- turned it over at once’to the Eighth
Directorate, dealing with coding and decoding.”

14 May 1964: Discussing the list drawn up by KOVSHUK
and the decision to withdraw U.S, EmbassyiSection require~
ments for full-time monitoring of certain microphones, NO=
SENKO quoted KOVSHUK: "We are getting information frdém the
rooms of the attaches, the Counsellor, and the Agricultural
Attache. The flats [Embassy apartments]--no; the bar--
nothing. Of course, I know it is necessary to keep the room
of the code clerks in spite of the fact that there is seldon
anything received except severjl numbers. The code clerk is
saying aloud several numbers. But the flats you can take,
not permanently, but temporarily." NOSENKO then continued:
“"KOVSHUK said to give them these flats... But you see,
nothing was going on in these flats. They weren't speaking
or we:e talking about steak and eggs. There was nothing
of intorest from an operating standpoint, Sometimes ve
heard there would be guests. Okay. There is a possibility
to hear something. In this case we would cell DMITRIYLY
[English-language Section of Second Special Departmert| and
say: ‘This evening, this day, this flat. Mzeybe we will
get something.’ The mikes were working not bad at all in
1960 and 1961 in the attache rooms--Naval, Air Force, When
the man was alone we heard nothing. But when two-or three
men were sitting in the rooms, the assistants, wo heard.

For example, when they returned from a trip ard discussed
what they had seen or when they were preparing for a trip...
But we heard nothing about agents."

Later on this occasion the following diagogue took
place:

NOSENKO; GRYAZNOV was telling me in 1962 and 1963 that
they were getting little, little, almost nothing.
He said we are losing everything. We have no
materials. We have little, little pieces, but
nothing.

Question: Was he talking about the Military Attaches?

NOSENKO: In general. I think they were speaking very
eae little. God knows. Then, you see, we were thinking
° they were taking new measures. GRYAZNOV,
FEDOSEYEV, and KOVSHUK considered that there was
& room-in-a~room--a room [acoustic] for the
meeting.
Question: When did you first hear about the room-inside-the-
———— room? a

NOSENKO: First it was known when, I think, Eisenhower was

going to come.* In 1960 or 1961 we had informa- : i
- tion that the Embassy had such a chamber made out “4

“*President Eisenhower's trip to the USSR was scheduled for

STEEN's office was working, I remember. Recep-
tion was good, but there was no secret informa-
tion. I don't know [about reception from this
mike in 1962].

Question: What about GRYAZNOV's statement [concerning
diminishing production of the Embassy microphones] ?

NOSENKO: This was only one common phrase. He didn't tell
aa which rocm, I think he was speaking about the
group...

Question: How was production from the mikes in HORBALY's

RNOSENKO: Not good, but we did get something which made us
suspect he was connected with intelligence.
HORBALY.

Question: What about the code room and teletype office? :
NOSENKO: At State, yes. Only always the sounds of nachires

in 1960 and 1961. Machines only. Three times

during these two years maybe somebody said one

phrase or one of the guys said several numbers.

Question: Waat about the military [code] area’ .

NOSENKO: The reception was good. He [STORSBERG] seldom
spoke. Sometimes he repeated numbers to himself.
And sometimes a mechanic of code machines cane
to him, a military guy, a sergeant (Willien
HURLEY, an Army Warrant Officer]. They said two
or three phrases. "Did you check this?" "Yes."
"This side good." Et cetera.

Question: In all this time that you read all this material,
there must have been something that impressed
you as extremely valuable.

NOSENKO: Extremely valuable--nothing. A little was in- i

hermatcaseaa teresting from FREERS' room. It was given to the i

special group of GRIBANOV, They were writing 4

pai special information to the [KGB] Chairman to the Bun
eee . {cpsu} Central Committee. There were political ? , vee ange
questions, for example. i

26 January 1936: The following is taken from an inter-
rogatfon protocol s ed by NOSENKO: "I regularly reviewed

all of the transcripts from microphones in the American

Embassy for a period of approximately two years, from Janu- -
ary 1960 to January 1962. The following is the only infor- © rvase

c. From the microphone in tne Military Attache's

discussed plans for trips within the USSR and the tar-
gets that they wanted to cover. They also discussed
the results.of these trips after their return: How-
ever, I cannot remember any information about speci-
fic trips planned oy specific “Military Attache per-

remember any specific operetionai activily taken by the
organs of the KGB against Military Attaches on trips 4

from this microphone. There was no -nteresting, impor- stay
tant, or useful information about the personal or pro- Ba
fessional lives or about the vuinerabilities of anyone ‘
in the Military Attache'’s office (Army, Navy, and Air) a
obtained from this microphone.

d. I remember that from the microphones in the
State Department code room occasionally a code clerk
would read numbers. These numbers were only of inter~
est to the Eighth Directorate (Communications and Crypto-
logy) of the KGB. I do not remember any conversations
from this microphone. There was no information from
this microphone on any of the code clerks which was
interesting, important, or useful to the U.S. Embassy

cous, 264.

Theodore F. HOFFMAN, Army Attache in Moscow from May
1959 to May 1961, has been interviewed concerning tae micro-
phone discoverias. (In the spring of 1961, Colonel HOFFMAN
was succeeded by Colonel URBAN as Army Attache.) While in
Moscow, Colonel HOFFMAN occupied room 1008, where the first
microphone was found and his statements below relate to
matters presumed to be of general and specific interest to
the U.3, Embassy Section during the period when NOSENKO
claims to have been its Deputy Chief.*

James H. STORSBERG [military code clerk] was
dating a foreign rational, 1 belicve a secretary in
the British Fmbessy, nawe not recalled. On one or
two occasions, he was needed either to decode or to
encode for dispatching a message and was not evail-
able. He would be off with his girl friends, and we
couldn't find him. He was verbally reprimanced in my
office in regard to the two incidents of absenteeism.

"M/Sgt. Peter BINDER gmanager of America House]
and I discussed frequently the administrative problems
encountered in his operatior of the America House.

We also discussed the importance of hts keeping me
informed of the conditions, personality problems,
drinking habits, and any other incident of importance
that mi.sht occur in the America House or the America
House club. All discussions were conducted in my
office.

"In May or June 1961, James C. KEYSERS [military
code clerk} was found to have allowed one or rore
male members of...a U.S. ice review entertainment group

‘ touring the Bloc countries to spend the night in his
room at America House. He was suspected of homosexual
activities, and he admitted to me being a participant
in homosexual activities. I believe these admissions
and my entire discussion with KEYSERS took place in
room 9, identified now as the shielded code room, lo~
cated on the ninth floor of the Embassy. I gave
SAVAGE [-his enlisted administrative assistant] verbal

- amstructions in my office to immediately prepare the
necessary paper work for removing KEYSERS from the
station and instructed him to inform ACSI by cable as
to the details of the incident.

"I remember...a discussion I held with the U.S.
Air Attache in his office [where a KGB’microphone was
located] concerning homosexual activities on the part
of two of the Air Force enlisted personnel on station...
_The discussion in his office concerned the administra-
tive procedures necessary in removing the individuals
from Station. :

‘*Apart from bis general duties as Deputy. Chie?’of the U.S.
Embassy Section, NOSENKO bore special responsibilities for

{Summing up]° "To be perfectly:.frank, I would ©
assume that...some of our modus operandi, some of our -
targets, sone of the results, ‘nd all of our personal L
weaknesses were compromised. This is not a very de- i
finite answer; however, it is the best estimate T cao 7

make."

In ite general introduction, the USIB damage ‘report
states: “Although there has been no’ observable indication r
thet the Soviets have acted in any manner to the detriment:
of the United States based upon information considered pos= é ics
sibly compromised, it must be concluded that due to the ex- +
tensive period of penetration, the cumulative, effect hes
resulted in serious damage to the United States. “The
Soviets have gained considerable knowledge as to the effective-
ness of United States operations within the, Sovict. Union,
particularly the military attache collection progran.

Soviet knowledge of U.S. emphasis upon certain intelligence

collection areas has made it possible for them to identify

priority intelligence and probable Soviet targets and thereby

permitted them to implement specific counteractions.. The

Soviets over the years must have amassed considerable infor-

mation concerning the personal habits, problens, attitudes :
and weaknesses of personnel assigned to the Embassy which
can be used by them for purposes of exploitation at any
time of their choosing in the future."

es eat

The following extract from the USIB damage report con-
cerns the declining value of the production from the micro-
phones in 1962 and 1963.*

“The security practices and procedures appear to
have followed a pattern from April 1953 to May 1960, at
a which time the first plastic room was installed. A
change occurred in the work habits in that the nore
senior State Department officers utilized the plastic
room for sensitive discussions and dictation. The
room could accommodate only a limited portion of the
Embassy classified discussions and accordingly, a number
of classified discussions were held outside this secure
area. In the April 1953-May 1960 period it was an ac~
cepted practice for the Ambassador and the Deputy
Chief of Mission to discuss openly in their offices
routine classified operations of the Embassy and to i
dictate classified documents and telegrams....In Sep-
tember 1962, the second acoustic room was erected for
the typing section for the handling of sensitive classi-
fied material. From December 1963 to date it was indi-
cated that no classified telegrams have been dictated

_%As previously indicated, NOSENKO. said that in 1962 and 1963
he learned there was almost no production from the Embassy
microphones. One reason was the natural decline in effi-

. etency of equipment installed ten years previously; the KGB
i, believed that other reasons were the installation of
acoustic rooms:..in the Embassy and. tightened security. pro- -

outside of the acoustic rooms....The military attaches
reported that most cables were drafted in longhand or
typed by the originator and then turned over to the
code clerks for transmission. In certain instances
cerbles were dictated in the offices. There were many
discussions in the offices relating to official duties,
office routine, proposed travel, personal observations
and normal office talk not specifically in themselves:
considered classified. From 1953 to 1959, sensitive
classified matters were discussed in whispers or to the
accompaniment of external noises, such as radios and--
street noises....In 1959 a secure inner room Was con~
structed in the attache section and has since been

utilized for classified discussions and debriefings...."

(441) Microphones in the Mocth Wing

According to NOSENKO, no microphones or other sudio devices
were installed in the north wing (as distinct from the cnancery)
of the U.S. Embassy prior to its occupancy in 1962. (For this
reason, NOSENKO advised CIA in 1962 to transfer its sensitive
offices gradually--to protect NOSENKO's sesurity--from the
chancery to the north wing at the Embassy.) He has commented
several times on this subject, and these remarks are presented
below.

11 June 1962: "The Embassy is now located on Chaykovskiy
Street. When they decided to give the north wing to the Embassy,
I wrote an entire report about it. SHELEPIN was still there
then [as KGB Chairman. “* proposed that! equipment be installed
in the walls, gave the justification for this, etc. SHELEPIN
wrote: ‘Is it worth it?' At the time trere was an improvement.
in mutual relations (between the Soviet Union and the United
States). SHELEPIN was a Good lad, but ced that...and kofore
this you found 18 or 20 microphones in the new building in War-
Saw.* SHELEPIN wrote: S$ it worth it? We now have good re-
lations with America. It isn't worth it.' He didn't want com-
plications. And. then time was lost. Two or three months passed
and we again wanted to try it. SHELEPIN also wanted to, but it
was already too late. ASIDIAN was going there all the time, the
Security Officer. It was already too late because this can be
Gone only while the building is being built. When the windows
and doors have been begun it is already too late... The north
wing was almost ready. We don't have anything there. So, you
should move the Minister Counsellor there. Move him to the
north wing from his present office... Don't do it at once. Do
it slowly. Don't hurry; don't be in a hurry. Have him say that
he doesn't like this room and wants to move there... We hear
all the military attaches--the Military Attache, the Naval
Attache, and the Air Force Attache--in Moscow. Everything is
recorded. But again, don't do anything at once. Don't make
any (sudden) changes. Quietly transfer one and then another
there (to the north wing), the attache himself and his assist-
ants... You must be very, very clever and very, very foxy...
Gradually, gradually move them to the north wing of the build-
ing, to the north wing, 1n which we have absolutely nothing and
won't have anything.“

31 January 1964: ‘When the construction of this right
(north) wing had begun, when you started the right wing, the

new addition to the building, there was a plan to install as
many (microphones) as possible--thirty, forty--stick them
everywhere. It really wasn't important how many of them would
really work. The Committee (KGB) Chairman at that time was
SHELEPIN, He didn't co for this. Whether it. was the flap
with the Poles that happened just before that* or whether it
was something else or whether it was the international situa-
tion, they were afraid that this may be uncovered. But then,
, later, when the building was finished, and when you were
finishing or putting up the addition yourself, at that point
at. ag too late to put these things in....It was. impossible
to do. it." H 3 Be AE A *k

# NOSENKO is referring to the discovery in June of. 1960 of
19 microphones: in the new U.S. Embassy in Warsaw.



After being told by .CIA on°31, January 1965.that a lead t
eable had been found in the north wing, NOSENKO said: "I i
personally can assure: you that nothing was done in that
a right wing. Nothing, absolutely nothing. There was nothing 4 |
done there, so it must have been something else." H

No extensive counter-audio checks nave yet been cerried
out in the north wing of the U.S, Embassy, and no wired = 5
microphones have been found there. Investigation of the i :
microphones inthe main section of the Embassy led, however, :
to the discovery of other Soviet technical equipment installed id
in the north wing. The USIB danage report stated: "Three- 7
coaxial cables were discovered running parallel to the one~ -
hundred-and-one pair audio cable from the North Annex roof
area to the basement of the North Annex...[All three cables
were severed by American technicians in 1964.] The ceble
runs were as follows:

"), The, first coaxial cable...terminated under six
inches of reinforced concrete in the North Annex attic.
The certer conductor was connected to the lead sheath
of the 20-padr and of the 30 pair cable which in turp
come irox the east face of the chancery. The shield of
the coaxial cable was uncunnected. ‘

"2, The second coaxial cable...followed the same path .
as the first coaxial cable. The shicld was unterminated,
The center conductor was terminated in an insulated
metal grill. The grill is loceted in the upper crust
of the North Annex attic floor with the long dimension
in juxtaposition to the old common wall between the
Chancery and the North Annex. The long dinénsion is
: normal to the street in front of the Embassy. The
EB yel grill is made of one centizeter steel reinforcing rods
spot welded into a mesh of 15 cm. (5.9 inches). The
overall dimensions of the grill are 14'4" by 4'7".
The coaxial cable was connected to one corner of the
i grill....The grill is located as close as possible to
the old common wall and is about thirty feet below the
State Department code room. The grill ‘points’ in the
general direction of the code room as the plane of the
grill is parallel to the plane of the ground.

"3, The third coaxial cable ran along the approximate
path of the other coaxial cables to the block cf rein-

:srazereees forced concrete that contains the grill mentioned above.
This coaxial cable terminated in a four-inch piece of
fine Lits wire. The shiéld of the coaxial cable was -
unterminated...".

The damagé- report added: . "The coaxial cables appear to be
of recent installation probably prior to Russian evacuation
ef the North Annex, The outer shields of all the coaxial
eables were carefully insulated."

. - The coaxial cables and their terminations were evaluated
as follows. in the damage report: "All tests that have been

7 [or tne indicate that the grill work and. the lead sheaths

of} the cables 20-and 30 patrs were used ag antennas.... ©

Ko function has been determined for the third coaxial cable

which terminated:in a short piece of Lits wire....The location



of the grill in such close ‘proximity to. the State Department

Code Room indicated that an operation was directed against
that area....The lead sheath nay have had other uses.

that has beén directed against the top floors--the “secure

a'.of the U.S, Embassy since the early 1950's from en

apartment building located about 200 feet away. Detailed
investigation of the signal has been underway since Octo=
ber 1962, but ite exact nature and purpose have not yet been
established. Although there is sone speculetion that the
signal is meant for ‘harasexent purposes only, the view now
generally accepted by U.S. technicisns is that it has sora

hag been noted since the discovery and the cutting of the

There is a beam, there is a ray which works - .

Do you know what it is? 7

No, I don't. Sut I know that they work and they
put things in, and they listen and they do sone-
thing, and they...

(Interrupting.) Is it successful, is it working?

Yes, they keep working: ell the time. Perhaps
periodically, but it's working. Yes, there is
something in the back.of the Embassy on this
Chaykovskiy Street, and there is something in
front of the Embassy, too.

And it is for listening in?

No, it's in order to deprive you of working with
stationary equipzent.

What do you mean--so that our receivers wouldn't
operate properly?

Look, I'm not a specialist. I don't know the
details. I know only that the work is being
dose in this particular area, in this particular
direction, But what they do, I dontt really
know.

But this is not for the purpose of obtaining in-
formation?

Let*s say you go on the air. So weifind out
whether you're listening in on some of our com—
munications or sonething like this.

Yo what extent vould you in your {American] De-
“partment,.in your {U.8. Babassy] tion; know

Xo, No. This is something that ‘the. menbers of.
the [KGB] Eighth Directorate {responsible for
communications and ciphers} skould concern then~
selves with, the ones who work in OTU. ‘This
doesn't concern us in the American Peparrnenne
in the U.S. Embassy Section.

° Questioned again later, NOSENKO seid that the signal
was used to jam U.S, equipment working in the Embassy building.
It wag this system, he said, which. had determined.that the 4
Americans had intercepted some GRU agent radio communications. fi 4
The beam was designed “both to-monitor- and to jam" trane~ |
‘missions from the Embassy... NOSENKO repeated that. "not being

& specialist" he was igcorant of the technical nature of the

job, or any further details. :

Because NOSENKO's true name and photographs had been submitted
to the U.S. fmbassy in Moscow in connection with this visa request,
NOSENKO added, it was henceforth necessary for him to use his
true name fer all travel abroad. j

ce. The Cuba TDY (1960)

In November 1960, after and as a result of the cancellation
of his planned trip to the United States, NOSENKXC travelled with
a delegation of nickel industry experts to Cuba. He first men-
tioned this trip on 11 June 1962, during his second meeting with
‘CIA. is account of his activities was given in answer to the
question of ther he had ever visited Germany: “I have been
in Germany. s, yes, I was in Cuba in '6}. Well, as NIKOLAYEY.
I was there a month and a half. This was when your Embassy was 5
there and we wanted to prepare*... Well, I looked it cver to
see what kind of people you there, They asked me
to prepare, so to speak, an acco’ w things were going.
I arrived there and asked how they were working against you, just
on you. Everyone there is worsiny for you. One, two, three,
five days went by... I had unlimited funds, any arcunt. I could
go to any restaurant, any show, So that's how it was with me.
The fellows reported: ‘He {an iumerican] is there.' My mission
was to get a general picture. Not for one, two, cr three days,
put for a month or two, to provide an opinicn... I worked pretty
cleverly on trem, He [the American] would go to a restaurant.
They would say to me: ‘He is at such-and-such a restaurant and
can be observed there.’ I would go and observe him in the mir-
ror or sowehcow, I am sitting in the restaurant, ng, and
that's all. But I would watch him to see how he behaves, etc.,
etc. That is, I would begin to feel if he has the mark of an
intelligence officer. ...But this was not enough for me. I
would go again and again. i would see that, yes, he is an in-
telligence officer... We were asked to share our experiences
with them [the Cuuans]. Tey didn't know a thing... They had
turned ali intelligence work over to the Communist Party. The
Communist Party complicates it."

In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in
1962 the sudject of his trip to Cuba came up again; NOSENKO re-
called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba
and that his function there was that of security officer.

Question: When did you travel to Cuba?
ROSENKO: 1960, November and December 1960.
Question: Under the name NIKOLAYEV?

NOSENKO: No, as NOSENKO, NOSENXO, NOSENKO. I will explain
how this happened. I was supposed to go to America,
sometime in November, with a group from Gosplan,
automotive specialists, etc. Data had alventh ly been
submitted for coordination and, in particular, my

{Moscow}. But the American Embassy announced that

that she was supposed to be reporting on? In the first place,
they were lazy bums. They would go to a lesson once and then
miss the next two and“then perhaps go again, and again miss one
or two." In September 1964 NOSENKO added that LEVINA had never
been targetted ayainst any particular individual and had never
provided any interesting reports on her American contacts... At

the end of 1960 or in the beginning of 1961, NOSENKO said, she
was released from the Emtassy by Paul SMITH, possibly because

she was a little deaf and one had to epeak loudly to her to be
understood.* NOSENKO turned LEVINA over to another officer be-
fore he returned to the Tourist Department, and later the British
Department was planning to use her in either the British or Cenad~
ian Embassies.

-4. Overseas Assignments see teased tee

a. Attempt to Obtain Assignment in Ethiepia (1960)

During the first half of 1960, NOSENKO said, he applied for
a permanent overseas assignment to Ethiopia because doctors had
prescribed a change of climate for his daughter Oksana's asthma.
O.M, GRIBANQV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, approved
his request, but then the KGB Personnel Department turned ee
down when a file review revealed potentially dangerous character
weaknesses.

MOSENKO described this matter on 14 April 1964 as follows:
*Gennadiy GRYAZNOV came to the American Cepartment of the Second
Chief Dircctorate in 1958. Before 1956 he was stucying in the
Higher School of the KGB and when he finished the school in 1956
he was assigned to the KGB Personne] Department, and then he came
to the American Department in 1958. So GRYAZNOV had very good
connections in the Personnel Department. So in 1960, when I
wanted to leave, to yo abroad on permanent assignment I said to
GRIBANOV: ‘Let me go for two years to Ethiopia.' When the Per-
sonnel Department refused to let me go, I decided I'd just have
to know what was there in my personal file. I had to learn what
it was that was causing all this. By that time GRYAZNOV was in
the American Department of the Second Chief Directorate and hap-
pened to be the head of the Party Organization of the entire

directorate, and he at cne time had worked in the Personnel Office -

himself. He sid: ‘Give me this thing and I'll see what I can
find out about it.' So he went to the Personnel Department and
through his friend there got my personal file. Then he gave me
a call and said to come over, I went to his office and he locked
the door. Of course, he couldn't give me this file, couldn't
let me hold it in my hands so to speak. So he read this case
to me, this 1954 case to me, about the woman and so forth,* and
then said that at that time they made an investigation of my
previous residence. And they found out that while I was study-
ing at the Institute [cf International Affairs] and was living.
on Pervaya Meschanskaya Street, all sorts of girls visited me;
different girls, a new girl would visit me almost every week.
This was in my file. Then this case that took place in 1954.
And then in 1960--and, incidentally, GRIBANOV mentioned this to
me also--the file said that I was drinking quite a bit, and for
this reason I had many fights with my wife. And that was all
that appeared in my file. Nothing else, whatsoever, besides
these things that I just mentioned.”

b. U.S. Visa Application (1960)

NOSENKO's true name appeared with 11 others on a 20 October
1960 request to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for visas for members
of a Soviet automotive exchange delegation which was scheduled

listed as an engineer, employed by the State Sciertific-Technical
Committee (GNTK). After defecting, NOSENKO told CIA that he had
been scheduled to accompany this delegation as a security offi- Basra
cer but that the delegatior.'s visit to the United States had 7 cs
been postponed at the last moment. He therefore did not travel - i
to this country.

He further explained, on 17 April 1964, why his visa appli-
cation had been submitted in true name ané under a different
cover: “In 1957 and 1958 I went to Londen as NIKGUA repre~
senting the Ministry of Culture, Then in 1959 I didn't go any-
where. ‘hen when this question came up of my going to the States
in 1960, I said: 'I'm rot going. I've n going under the

A name for his trip to the United States.
He replied: "Sure, iid have gone as NIFOLAYEV, but I just
didn't want to. Pecause, look, it was known to us that the
British and American Incelfigence exchange information on people
they suspect of being KGb, and that the British, of course,
had probably watched me when 7 was in England [in 1957 and 1958] ;
and probably there it was noticed that here's this man under $

kind of looks suspicious. Then he goes to the Soviet Embassy.
Also suspicious. So then I aave to go to the States. And if
I go as NIKOLAYEV I couldn't use--in that case I couldn't use
the same cover of Ministry of Culture Lecause of the type of
the delegation. I'd have to use a different cover. So I'd go
there and they'd say: ‘Aha, here's NIKOLAYEV under different
cover now.* But if I go as NOSENKO, the British never heard
the nang. Nobody knows the name. Everything would be 0 ied
NOSENKO was then asked why he could not have travelled u der
some other alias. He answered: “That's the way it wes Ge-
cided. I guess so as not to get all mixed up they decided to
send me as NOSENKO anyway. It's up to the people who are in
charge of these operations. They are the ones who decide."**

Because NOSELKO's true name and photographs had been submitted
to the U.S. fmbassy in Moscow in connection with this visa request,
NOSENKO added, it was henceforth necessary for him to use his
true name for all travel abroad.

e. The Cuba TOY (1960)

In November 1960, after and as a result of the cancellation
of his planned trip to the United States, NOSENXO travelled with
a delegation of nickel industry experts to Cuba. He first men=
tioned this trip on 11 June 1962, during his second meeting with
‘CIA, Nis account of his activities was given in answer to the

question cf whether he had ever visited Germany: "I have been
in Germany. Yes, yes. 1 was in Cuba in '6}, Well, as NIKOLAYEY.
I was there a month and a half. This was when your Embassy was

that's all. But I would watch him to see how he behaves, etc.,
etc. That is, I would begin to feel if he has the mark of an
intelligence officer. ...But this was not enough for me. I
would go again and again. i would see that, yes, he is an in-
telligence officer... We were asked to share our experiences
with them [the Cubans]. Tiley didn't know a thing... They had
turned all intelligence work over to the Communist Party. The
Communist Party complicates it."

In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in
1962 the subject of his trip to Cuba came up again; NOSENKO re-
called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba
and that his function there was that of security officer.

Question: When did you travel to Cuba?
ROSENKO: 1960, November and December 1960.
Question: Under the name NIKOLAYEV?

BOSENKO: No, as NOSENKO, NOSENKO, NOSENKO. I will explain
how this happened. I was supposed to go to America,

All of NOSENKO's accounts since contacting CIA in 1964 have
been generally consistent with that given on 14 June 1562. His
story has been as follows: In the latter part of 1960, at the
same time as he was preparing for his intended trip to the
United States, a special delegation of nickel industry experts
from Gosplan, the Soviet State Planning Commission, was prepar- 7
ing £6. ae rture to Cuba. The delegaticn was a routine one, ?
consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of the :

7 Soviet Union, and since there was no one under any sort of sus—
picion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abroad) Department of
the Second Chief Directorate had decided that it would not be
necessary to include a security officer. Two days prior to the
departure of the group, however, the Central Committee of the
Communist Party decided that a Second Chief Directorate case
officer must go along. Because of the short time remaining be-
fore the scheduled departure of the delegation, the Eleventh
Department protested that it would be impossible to find a suit-
able person and get all the necessary papers ready in time. At
this point, A.I. KUZNETSOV of the Eleventh Department said:
"gust a minute. We have a man who has his passport all ready.

4. the Bulgaria Toy and the LUWT Case
: In the spring of 1961, four months after returning from j

Cuba, NOSENKO was sent on temporary assignment for about a
month to Sofia, the only trip he took in other than a security ¢
"watchdog" capacity. According to NOSENKO, it happened this Ree
way: “I think I first heard that I waa going to Bulgaria, a |
week or 80 before I left, from 8.1. YEGORCY, Chief of the Hy
section having contact with the counterintelligence representa 7
tives of the Countries of the Pecples' Democracies in Moscow...
He said: '‘Ycu must go to Bulgaria. GRIBANOV has decided." :
He asked, 'Do you know about this?’ and 1 said ‘No.' He said: H
"KLYPIN [Chief of the American Department} mast tell you,’ But
this was the first I had heard about it. YEGOROV said that the
Minister of the Bulgarian MVR had requested the Chairman of the
Bt KGB to send an officer from the American Department of the Sec~
ond Chief Directorate to Bulgaria for consultation with the
-=_-vpAmerican Department, Sec Directorate of the MVR of Bulgaria
“After one or two days KLYPIN told me about it. He repeated ~
the same thirg and after about one and a half weeks I flew to
Sofia." The discussicn continued as follows:

Question: What plans were made for this trip in Moscow before
you left? What briefings or discussions were held
concerning what you were to do in Scfia?

NOSENKO: I was told: “You are goirg for consultations. There
are KGB advisors there. They will discuss it with
you." No one was speaking with me about my trip.

Question: What discussions did you have with your department
chief, KLYPIN, about what you were to do on this
trip?

: NOSENKO: Nothing. He told me: “You will go. You will see
: what they are doing. You will tell them how to

work.”

Question: Did you have any meetings or discussions with the
representatives of the Bulgarian MVR in Moscow be~
1 fore you left?

NOSENKO: No.

Question: What discussions did you have with YEGOROV or his
section about what you were going to do in sofia?

NOSENKO: YEGOROV said: “You will go. You will tell us what
they are doing." H

Before you left Moscow for Sofia did you know any-
thing about the size of the American Department of
the Bulgarian MVR?

"No. ‘Nothing. : ra anaes ata

NOSENKO: No. Nothing.

Question: Did you know just what was the area of responsibility

NOSENKO: Wo. Nothing.

NOSENKO flew from Moscow in early April 1961 and was met
at the airport in Sofia by A.S. KOZLOV, a former Second Chief
Directorate officer whom he had known in Moscow.* The follow
ing morning he was picked up in an official vehicle and wes
taken to KOZLOV's office in the Bulgarian MVR building, not far
away. NOSENKO asked KOZLOV what was expected of him and was
told that "they want to know about how to work against the Ameri-
can Legation. He said he wanted me to tell them everything about
how to work, right from letter 'A.'" NOSENKO was. then intro-
duced to the Chief KGB adviser in Sofia, Mikhail YEGOROV, and
to the Chief of the MVR's American Department, after which he
was assigned an office in the HVR building. During the ensuing
weeks he discussed both general matters and particuler cases
with individual Bulgarian officers working against the American
target. On one occasion he lectured interested MVR officers
on the principles of operations against foreign military person-
nel in Moscow, and on another he visited an MVR surveillance

i

}

post opposite tne American Legation. He discussed.KGB methods

of operations against foreign tourists. He also addressed the

entire American Department for about five hours and told them tS
“what is necessary, what to pay attention to, how to work.* 4

At the end of his visit, some time in mid-May, NOSENKO conferred H
with the First Deputy Minister of the MVR about what had been ,
accomplished and his recommendations for improving operations
against Americans.

As an outgrowth of his TDY to Bulgaria, NOSENKO has pro-
vided one lead to a case in which he said he took pérsonal part. i
About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around the end of
April 1961, NOSENKO was going over lists of foreigners who were
scheduled to visit Bulgaria* in the near future, and he came
across the name Horace G. LUNT. NOSENKO recalled that a man
named LNT who was a Slavic linguist had been reported to him
in 1958 or 1959 by one. of his homosexual agents, VOLKOV or ;
YEFREMOV, as a possible homosexual, He asked the Bulgarians
whether this man was a specialist in Slavic languages. When :
the Bulgarian officers replied in the affirmative, NOSENKO de~- :
cided to check his recollection against KGB records and an
immediate phone call was placed to Moscow,: asking for traces.

¥-"WOSENKO had earlier reported that KOZLOV had served as the
Chief of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate,
until 1953 and that, until about two years before going to
Bulgaria as a counterintellisence advisor, he had been
Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department. For the two years
immediately prior to his Bulgarian assignment, he had been
Secretary of the Party Organization of the Second Chief
Directorate and was relieved of all other duties. Asked
why KOZLOV was unable to “advise” the Bulgarians in this
instance, NOSENKO said that he was too busy advising on
higher levels and that he had been.away from the. work’ for

. So 2816.

A reply was received almost at. once: - "Yes.. This is the same ~
LUNT who was in Moscow. Homosexual." NOSENKO told Cia. that
the KG2 had never done anything with its knowledge of LUNT's
homosexual proclivities and that the Bulgarian MVR had not pre-
viously known of them. :

HOSENKO's description of what happened next is as follows:
"yozLO’ and the Chief of the American Department were very in-
terested. KOZIOV said: ‘George {NOSENKO]. you must help them.
They never recruited an American.’ I said that I would do what
I could, The three of us went to see General DUMKOV, the
Chief of the Second Directorate, Bulgarian MVR. I asked them
if they had a homosexual agent. They checked and said they
had one who is an operational conzact. 0.., T said, acquaint
them, prepare a flat, make the pictures. This is the first
stage. I also told them, of course, to find out how long he
had been tuere, why, who his acquaintances were, etc. Then we
went to YEGCROV, the senior Soviet advisor, and KOZLOV. called
GRIBANOV. GRIEANOV, I later found out, was'in a meeting with
the department chiefs of the Secord Cl f Directorate and was
not in a good mood, Why, I don't know. ie didn't understand
what KOZLOV was saying. GRIPANCV thought that I, myself, wanted
to make the approach to LUNT. KOZLOV got confused oa the prone.
GRIBANOV asked to speak to me, I took the phone, ‘What are
you doing?’ he said. ‘You are not at home, you are abroad.

You were sent only for consultations, but you are living as if
you were at home.’ I said: 'O.K., O.K. I wasn't going to do
anything.' He hung ug. I told KOZLOV that even if the Bulgar-
dans were to ask me, I could not do it myself. YEGCROV became
upset. He thought our position was bad because the Bulgarians
were asking. ‘What they ask, I will tell,’ I said, ‘but I am
not leaving the office to go any place or do anything. I can
only advise them on how to make the record entries after he is
caught. I can dictate the questions to he asked. But the
approach and recruitment I cannot do myself.’

“The Bulgarians never said anything to me about active
participation, but they didn't know what to do. I told them
to get two agents. Maybe LUNT wouldn't like the first one.
The Bulgerians reported that LUNT wouldn't be there long. I
told them that if they wanted to take pictures and make a pitch
later, that's one thing. But if they wanted to do it all in
one step, that is another. I told them they should consider the
time element... The Chief cf the American Department, KOVACHEV,.
and the chief of the section dealing with tourists and American
delegations were to make the recruitment. The approach was
made at the end of April, I think.” Been :

NOSENKO went on to say: “I was in the effice during the
approach. I told them I would not leave. ‘If you need my

advice,’ I said, ‘come to me.' KOZLOV and I were sitting in
his office. It was the end of April, I think, and the next
day I went on holiday. I don't know where or how they approached.
LUNT. I only advised them that after the first conversation with

him they would know if he would be willing to cooperate. If said
they should have an apartment ready... not far from Sofia. I _
should change the place right
away. Take him some place nice to finish the conversation

that what I suggested." . i i ‘

the future, a contact in the United States or not. They said
they decided against it because he was to come to Bulgaria in
1962 or 1963 for a Slavic conference.”

This account, which NOSENKO gave on 6 October 1964, differs 3

his second meeting with CIA. NOSENKO claimec tnen that he per= i

Affairs there asked for a specialist to help them. I went to
help. An {American] professor arrived, a very prominent special- 4
dst on the Slavic countries... They [the Bulgarians} had never . ‘|
tried {to reerait}] an American. ‘Let's try,’ I said, The Sov- hd
diet advisor Bulgaria telephoned GRIBANOV and reported that

NOSENKO had deczded that it is possible to get this American.

GRIBASCY was in a conference at the time. GRIBANOV said: "Where

the hell's NOSENKO? Let me talk to him What the hell are

you doing? I sent you only as an advisor.' Then he hung up.

What ccuid I do? The Buicarians had already mace all prepara~

tions... i was embarrassed, but what could I do? I left the

office of the advisor and they ‘ere waiting for me... I de-

cided to go ahead. I was sure that it would work. I felt that

it could be done, that this American could be firmly recruited... eit
I spit on everything and went ahead with the Bulgarians. TI i
told them to grab him. I£ it will be difficult for you, tell
me and I myself can recruit him. Weil, they began and I came
there. He [NCSENKO is speaking of himself] was under the guise
of a Bulgarian and spoke in English, althougn my English was
poor... I said: ‘You are a pederast.' He also proved him-
self to be a homosexual there [in Bulgaria}... ‘Well, what will
society think of you, those whose know you?' Well, what did
this person decide? He agreed."

The first time NOSENKO said that he had not participated 4
directly in this operation was on 2 February 1964, while still
in Geneva. He volunteered the following: “In Bulgaria in
April and May 1961, although I did not personally participate
in this, I went there, and-I helped them there with the whole
process of recruitment of this professor. I helped the Bul-
garians with what to do and how. He was the professor of
philolesy, LIuT."

ec

NOSENKO has also varied on the timing of the operation

ed above, he said that the
approach was made the day before he left on his. May Day holi-
day. On 24 April 1964 he said: "I remember that it was at
the very beginning of May that this name came up. And we got
the informaticn from Moscow the same day, telling us it was
the same LUNT. I went on a trip the 1st, 2nd, 3rd of May.
That is the 30th of April, lst and 2nd of May, and the 3rd of |
May in the morning I was back. So it was in the very beginning
after the night of the trip. And Moscow was called right away,



given all the:data, and-they: called. baék right away and said:.

"Yes, this is the samé,LUNT who.was in Moscow..." As.soon as
this was established,‘the next day the Bulgarians planted this
homosexual cn him. They planted this man either next to him
or in the restaurant and, well, he met LUNT and they got tc-
gether and cecided to meet with each other the same day or the
next day. This was all-done very rapidly.”

According to Professor LUNT, the approach actually took
place on 5 May 1961, following a visit to Moscow where he had
contacted an official in the U.S. Embassy. Ee travelled on
9 May directly from Sofia to Yugoslavia, where he at once re-
ported the incident to U.S. Ambassador George MENNAN,.an aca~
demic acquaintance. LUNT told the Ambassador, and later CIA,
that he had visited Sofia on one earlier occasion, from 8 to
28 November 1960. During this first trip he became involved
with one Georgi Velev ALEKSIEV, with whom he engaged in homo-
sexual relations on at least five separate occasions and to
whem he gave U.S. travellers checks, which ALEKSIEV intended
to sell on the black market. On one occasion during the first
visit ALEKSIEV was recognized and stopped by the Bulgarian
civil police while walking cn the street with LUNT. After

‘ leaving Bulgaria in November 1969, LUNT received two letters

from ALEKSIEV and prior to his next visit, cn 25 April 1561,
LUNT wrote ALEKSIEV saying he would be returning.



5. Transfer to the Tourist. Department in January 1962

In the autumn of 1961 a decision was reached, on the basis
of NOSENKO's own request, to return him to the Tourist Depart-
ment. GRIBANOV had originally wanted to promote NOSENKO from
the position of Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section to the
pest of Deputy Chief of the American Department; NOSENKO'S
superior and friend KOVSHUK had long had his eye on this job,
however, and was the personal choice of the Chief of the Ameri-
can Department for it. (In fact, NOSENKO said, KOVSHUK had :
once held the job, lesing it in 1959 because of some misbehavior.)
NOSENKO did not want to be placed in the difficult situation
which his own promotion to this post weuld have created. NOSENKO

. @escribed his transfer in the February 1965 interrogations. The

following is from a protocol signed on 26 February 1965:

“The decision for. me to return to the Seventh [Tourist]
Departrent.in January i962 was actually made in about Septem~
ber or October 1961. GRIBANOV planned to appoint me Deputy
Chief of the First [American] Department, but the new Chief
of the First Department, FELOSEYEY,wanted KOVSKUK to take
this position. Since I did not want to be placed in this
position by GRIBANOV's order against the wishes of FEDOSEYEV,
I went to GRIBANOV and requested that I be transferred back
to the Seventh Department, in any position. I had aiready
spoken to [V.D.] CHELNOKOV, who was then Chief of the
Seventh Department, about this matter and he had suggested
that I go to GRISANOV and ask to be returned to the Seventh
Department as Chief of the First (American-British-Canadian}
Section with the understanding that I would be appointed -
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department as soon as this
position would be vacated by [B.A.] BALDIN [who was retiring
in July 1962]. ...GRIBANOV did not teli me his reasons...
for wanting to appoint me Deputy Chief of the First Depart-
ment in late 1961 or for appointing me Section Chief and
later Deputy Chief of the Severth Department in 1962. He
did not discuss witi me my personal qualifications for
each of these positions."

Aware of his impending transfer NOSENKO took the opportunity
during December 1961 to spend several hours each day in the Tour=
ist Department. There he talked with Department Chief CHELNOKOV,
familiarized himself with certain files of the American Tourist
Section, “and discussed current operations and operational possi-
bilities with the officers assigned to this section. The formal
order for the transfer was signed by GRIBANOV on 24 or 25 Decem-
ber 1961 and NOSENKO officially signed over the ABIDIAN case file
and the U.S. Embassy security file to his successor as Deputy
Chief of the American Embassy Section, G.I. GRYAZNOV, within the
next few-days.* As he had when he transferred from the Tourist
to the American Department in 1960, NOSENKO said, he took his
active agents and his safehouse on Vorovskiy Street with him when
he mturned to the Tourist Department in 1962.

¥ Yhese specific dates Were arrived at under interrogation in

«February 1965. On all earlier occasions NOSENKO had said
that he was transferred in January 1962 (or some later date);
he said in. February 1965 that he was "officially® transferred

't the end of December and reported to his new position at
the beginning of January. (see below).

P. ‘January. 1962 to January 1964 (Tourist Department).

1, Date of Transfer

NOSENKO has given different dates for the time when he left
the U.S, Embassy Section of the American Department to become
Chief of the American-British-Canadian Section of the Tourist
Department. During the Geneva meetings of 1962 he said on

-a@ifferent occasions that this occurred in January 1962 and in

February 1962; in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling between
15 and 20 January 1962; and in February 1965 NOSENKO gave the
date as 2 or 3 cznuary 1962, He has also reported that he was
in the U.S. Embassy Section for three months after John ABIDIAN
serviced the Pushkin Street dead drop (on 30 December 1961, thus
placing NOSENKO in the U.S, Embassy Section until late March
1962) and that he had transferred to the Tourist Department by
the time GOLTTSYN defected (which NOSENKO placed in mid-January
1962 but which actually occurred in mid-December 1963).* W.E.
JOHNSON, the target of a Tourist Department operaticn** con-
firmed that NOSENKO approached him in Moscow on 5 January 1962.

In Fabruery 1965 NOSENKO said he recalled that the correct
date of his approach to JOHNSON was on 5 January 1962. The CIA
interviewer then reminded NOSENKO that he had earlier described
on several occasions his visit to the dead drop site on Pushkin
Street and his receipt of reports from the surveillance post
for three months afterwards; during all of this period, NOSENKO
had said, he was in the U.S, Embassy Section of the First Depart—
ment. NOSENKO was told that CiA records show that ABIDTAN made
only one visit to this dead drop site,.on 30 December 1961, six
days before the approach to JOHNSON. He answered only that he
might have been confused, but despite any contradictions the
“facts” (his emphasis) were the important thing, not any corre-
lation of dates.

2. Eunctions and Activities

As Chief of the american-British-Canadian Section of the
Tourist Department (hereafter in Part V.F. referred to as the
American Tourist Section) from January to July 1962, NOSENKO
said, he was responsible for planning and coordinating all
KGB activities against such tourists in the USSR as well as
for supervising the operational work of 15 subordinate case
officers. He had no deputy. NOSENKO told CIA that he required
several months at the beginning of 1962 “to get the feel of

> things"; "there were no accomplishments" on his part in the

initial period on this new job, and plans for handling the
influx of American tourists during the forthcoming 1962 season
consisted of studying files and continuing to work against the .
tourists as in the past. NOSENKO was asked in February 1965 -

whether, in his first several, months in the Tourist Department,
he had originated any new methods for operations ageinst An-
erican tourists. Ke replied that during this period he -nad
proposed a study of representatives of forsian tourist firms
in Moscow with an eye toward the KGB attempting to recruit
them." ‘This suggestion, NC K2 said, had been accepted.

In March 1965, NOSENKO was asked wharc new
cerning the use of tourism for espionag? purposes ny foreign
incelligence organizations had been acquired by the XG8 during
his two-year absence from the Tourist Department. He replied
that. the KGB had noted an increase in automobile tourism and
that Anerican Intelligence had increased its use of multinational
tourist groups. NOSENKO was then asked what new
concerning the use
had been obtained by the KGB from any ag
period NOSENKO answered that he neither
information nor had he heard of such an a

knowledge con-

NOSENKO has said that, in line with the wishes of the Chief
of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, O.M. GRIBANOY, ne was pro-
moted to the tion of Deputy Chief of the entire Tourise
Department in July 1962, immediately efter his return from
Geneva. A ye ater he was made Fi Deputy Chief of the
Department, a promotion which involved only a change in title
as there was no Second Deputy Chief at the time. Apert from
saying he was V,D, CHELNOKOV's second-in-c md from July 1962
to January 1964 and as such general supervisor of all KGB tour-
ist operations, NOSENKO has not detailed the functions attached
to this position; NOSENKO has not been questioned specifically
concerning these duties.

NOSENKO's first operational activity after transferring to
the American Tourist Section was supervision of a homosexual
approach to W.E. JCHISN on 5 January 1962. Additionally, during
the 1962-64 period in the Tourist Department NOSENKO tcok part
in the recruitment approach to Horst BRAUNS, in the interrogation
of Yale University Professor Frederick BAECHOORN, and
arrest of the Averican tour guide Bernard KOTEN. For a short
time in 1963 he handled the KGB agent Alexander SVENCHANSKIY,
owner of a tourist agency in New York Cizy‘*** and a Russian
language bookstore in Chicago, Illinois. by virtue of his

*NOSENKO said at another time that he made the same proposal

in 1958-59, forming the basis of the FRIFPEL operation (see
Part V.D.5.).
*® See Part V.D.7.b., which discusses the KGB agent George
BLAKE, a staff officer of MI-6, who confessed after his
arrest in April 1961 that he had passed to his Soviet
handlers the complete minutes of joint meetings held by
CIA and MI-6 in London in June 1959 and in Washington
during April 1960. These meetings vere held to coordinate
the American and British programs fer leqal travel opera- ceeeeeer
tions, mainly with tourists, into the Soviet Union.
Part V.D.7.c. describes a top secret KGB document on
destern tourist operations in the Soviet Union which was
peepared in 1961 in the Tourist Department of the KGB i
Second Chief Directorate. This document, which the N
defector GOLITSYN gave CIA, quoted verbatim certain {
pagssons of the minutes given to the KGB by BLAKE,

Supervisory posit‘+n in the Tourist Department NOSENKO also be-

came involved with John SHUSZIN, a GRU agent. (These six cases -
JOHNSON, BRAUNS, BARGHOORN, KOTEN, SVENCHANSKIY, and SHUBIN - are

discussed below.) NOSENKO reported that his planned role in the-

approach to Natalie BIENSTOCK (see Part VI.D.2.) was prevented
by his preparations to leave for Geneva in March 1962. Finally,
NOSENKO said he participated in the KGB invescigation of Lee
Harvey OSWALD after P-esident KMINEDY's assassination in Novem-
ber 1963 (see Part V.D.6.).

NOSENKO has indicated that his own operational work in 1962
to 1964 was limited to those cases cited above hecause of the
considerable amount of time spent on temporary duty assignments
outside Moscow during these two years. In mid-February 1962,
soon after assuming the duties of Chief of the American Tourist
Section, he began to prepare for his first trip to Geneva, which
lasted from 14 March until 15 June 1962 (see Part III,B.). NOS-
ENKO estimated that he had spent a total of six months outside
Moscow in 1963 on temporary assignments. These included a two-
day trip to Odessa to meet FRIPPEL, an inspection tour of the
Leningrad £GB organization, a five-day trip to Leningrad for a
conference on border control, a week-long trip to Alma-Ata for
a conference on tourist travel with KGB representatives from
the Soviet Central Asian republics, and an eight- or ten-day
inspection trip to the Caucasus as a memker of a tean headed by
GRIBANOV. NOSENKO said he travelled to Gérkiy Oblast on 16-17
December 1963 to.assist in the search for CHEREPANOV, who had
passed top secret documents to the U.S, Embassy in Moscow (see
Part VI.D.7.c.).

3. NOSENKO's Agents

when NOSENKO returned to the Tourist Department in the
first days of 1962, he took with him the agents whom he had
been handling as Deputy Chief of the U.S, Embassy Section,
These agents are listed below with a summary of NOSENKO's com-
ments concerning their use in 1962 and 1963.*

a. Arsene FRIPPEL:

FRIPPEL had been reassigned from Moscow in early 1961, but
NOSENKO continued to be the Second Chief Directorate case offi-
cer in charge of any future KGB contacts with him. (FRIPPEL
had no KGB contacts in New York City.) Describing FRIPPEL's
past service for the KGB on 15 June 1962, five months after he
said he transferred to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO said:
“FRIPPEL was afraid and gave practically nothing... He was
a weak agent... I recruited him but, speaking honestly, he
was not an agent." Nevertheless, NOSENKO said, the KGB hoped
that FRIPPEL would be reassigned to the USSR at some future
date. When FRIPPEL returned twice to the Soviet Union in
1963, NOSENKO met with him, once in Odessa and once in Moscow,

;

The only other agent. whom NOSENKO handled during this

- period was the Anerican Alexander SVENCHANSKIY. (See
Part V.F.6.). ie : ;

Whereas NCSENKO had normally me IFPEL in the company of
CHELNOKOV during FRIPPEL's Moscow tour, he went alone to the
tivo 1963 meetings.

ineligible for further use against Anericans the

Marina RYTOVA was turned over to NOSENKO by I.A. KONSTAN-

she was working as an interpreter at the Russian Permanent
Exhibition in Moscow. In 1960 or 1961 she became an instructor
of the Greek language at the Institute of International Relations,
and some time in 1962 she got a job at the school of the Central

Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Thereafter ~

she ceased all agent work. NOSENKO was officialiy registered as
her case officer until his defection in 1964. He cid not andi-
cate that RYTOVA took part in any operations from January 1962

until she began work for the Central Comn.

4. Approach to W.E. JOHNSON

a. NOSENKO's Information:

NOSENKO first. referred to his approach to the American
tourist Wallace Everett JOHNSON on 11 June 1952." He did not name
JOHNSON at this time: "In January of this year I recruited fan
American/. I cannot reinember his name. He is from California,
a Baptist, a young guy, healthy, somewhat fat, and he turned out
to be a homosexual.* He loved men. I have en agert network
capable of anything and, in particular, although I head a section
there, I have a good agent apparatus, i.e., I have beautiful
girls... and I have young pederasts, homos2xuals._ In partic-
ular, I have one special pair /VOLKOV and YEFREMOV/ ~ I'm afraid
that they are known to you and the English... Here is what
happened. He cave me a signature. I told him: ‘Write it your-
self.’ So he typed it on a typewriter, I said: ‘No, I don't
want it typed. write it out longhand.'... Ee had a very re-
actionary attitude toward the Soviet Union. His attitude was
such that he insulted us terribly. He visited Baptist groups,
churches and... insulted us, Russia, and the coverrment horribly.
He sent letters, and we read them all - awful letters, i.e., the
government is lousy and everything here is poor. I said to him:
‘Write, damn it, that the best country /in the worla/ is the
Soviet Union, that the best government is the Soviet Government.
Write, write.‘ In general he did everything /I asked/ but then,
right away, he ran to the Embassy_and told everything. This
was in January of this year /1962/. He told everything. 1
know that he told. But he gave me his signature that he would
help the Soviet security organs, etc. I know this. I was
there. I decided to go to the hotel where he was staying. I
sat down and waited. Surveillance was on the job. 'Tell me
when he comes,' /I ordered/. I sat down. i@_has come,’ /the
surveillance_team reported/. ‘where is he

ported that he had gone to eat in the restaurant and I went
there at once. He was sitting alone. I approached him:
‘Hello, how are you?’ I didn't say anything to him, _I knew
that he had told everything in the Embassy. /I sai ‘How .
are you? How about our connection in the States? And our
work in the States? what.do you think about it?‘ I said to
him: ‘Will you work? Can you give us something important or

everything." :
NOSENKO's first reference to JCHNSON in 1964 was at a meet- 1

ing on 2 February, when he produced a note bearing that name an
the date 5 January 1962. “Here I have a name jotted down, i
Everett wallace /sic/ JOHNSON," NOSENKO said. "The date was

S January 1962, but what took place i have absolutely no recol-

lection. I don't think it was a recruitment, but it was some

sort of vontact, or he was being’ studied or worked on, or some-

thing like that. But I remember nothing."

NOSENKO next mentioned his epproach to JCHNSON on 17 April
1964, Although net Giately recalling JOHNSON's name, he
eventually rememkere at “it was scmething like JOHNSON,
JOHNSTON, or something that sterts with a ‘J'" ard that he was
a@ Baptist from the California coast. NOSEIKO placed the opera-
ticn sometime in the summer of 1962, after his return to Moscow
from Geneva, because he also remexbered wearing "just a coat, ~
no Overcoat at the time." JOHNSON, who had come to tne Soviet 1
Union as a tourist, was known to be a socialist, and on this
basis the KGB Second Chief Directorate considered him as a
recruitment target. When the Second Chief Directorate checked
whether the KGS First Chief Directcrate would have any use for
JOHNSON as an agent, however, it learned there was no interest

lived too far from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United i
States for convenient contact. Hi

Several days later KGB surveillance observed JOHNSON
mailing some letters in Moscow, When read by the KGB they were
found to be_"so bitter toward the Soviet Union, angry, critical,
that they /the KG3/ decided something had to be done" to stop
him from writing letters and making anti-Soviet statements on
his return to the United States. At about the same time there
Was some sign that JOHNSON was a homosexual, and it was decided
to entrap him on this basis. The sole reason was to halt
JOHNSON's criticism of the USSR - no recruitment was attempted,
because neither the Pirst nor the Second Chief Directorates
had any use for him as an agent and because the KGB had detere
mined that he probably would not accept a recruitment proposal
anyway. NOSENKO did not know why he was selected to make the
approach to JOHNSON, except that "BOBKOV said I should go."

JOHNSON became acquainted with VOLKOV and YEFREMOV at the
Metropol Hotel. They told JCHN30N that they had recently ar~
rived in Moscow and invited JOHISON- to visit their hotel room.
JOHNSON agreed because “they understood each other right away.
They knew they were the same {i.e., homosexuals) and so he came,
and when they were engaged in their business, our people walked
in on them under the disguise of the hotel administrator and
one militiaman." Ptotographs of the incident had been taken,
but these had not been developed at the time of this, the first
confrontation of JOMISOY A report describing the circumstances

(an akt) was prepared, and JOHNSON was then transferred to another

room. By this time, NOSENKO had arrived at the hotel from his
office, ard he went into the room where JOHNSCN was waiting in
accordance with KGB orders. NOSENKO discussed the situation
with JOmISON, then asked him to type and sign a statement that
he would “not say anything derogatory about the Soviet Union."
JOHNSON did as he was told.

The following day, after the incriminating photographs had
been developed, NOSENKO approached JOHNSON in the cafe of the
Metropol Hotel and esked him whether he intended to keep his
promise. When JOHNSON said that he planned to do so, NOSENKO
Presented him with an envelope containing copies of the photo-
Graphs and said that they would ke leaked to the foreign press
if JOHNSON were to break his promise. ‘The KG3 later learned
that JOFISON had visited (or phoned, according to a later ver-
sien) the U.S. Embassy and assumed that he had reported the
approach. NOSENKO did not recail what name, if any, he had
used during this operation.

Questioned further on 24 April 1964, NOSENKO said that,
upon his arrival at the hotel immediately after the compromise,
the militiaman described the incident to him in JOHNSON's pre-
sence. Addressing JOHNSON, NOSENKO had said: “How come? How
could you do such a thing? What are we going to do now? After
all, this is punishable by court and... people are given from
five to eitht years for such relations. It used to be three
to five, not it's from five to eight." Frightened by this,
JOHNSON had written and signed his Promise not to denigrate
the Soviet Union in the future.

NOSENKO was asked whether the KGB would mount such an
operation against any foreigner who wrote uncomplimentary
letters and articles about the USSR. He replied: “They don't
jump on everyone, and not everyone writes this. way. - And not
everything that is written this way gets into their hands.

In this case there was a coincidence. - There was something we
could hit him on. For instance, if the fact that he is a a

“course, because we haven't seen“him yet. *-But even that first
“signal is very helpful. So if he: goes on a Soviet plene, they
will start watching him from the time the flight starts. Now,

as soon as he crosses the Lorder, he willbe watched by the
order guards; he will.be watched the entire route of his travel.
This is a very important busiress, because the main task in re-
gard to tourists is to uncover within the gereral flow of tourists
those persons wao are of interest from the operational point of
view... Let's just say that this person is processing a group
of American tourists who are going to the Soviet Union, and,
when the processing is almost finished, another person is added
to the group. Nebody knows this person in the group... but he
was added_at the lest minute. So this is an indication. This is
what he /the agent/ was taught to pay attenticn to when he was
being trained in Moscow... Now, if some official government
agency makes a request that a man be sent to the Soviet Union as
.a tourist, this immediately arouses suspicion, of course... In
such things he has been trained... He comes to Moscow once or
twice a year, You know, such a little Jewisn fellow - an emigre
from Russia - in the past, you know, scared of everything. The
last time he came he told us: ‘You know, I'm thinking about it
all the time,' he says. So they esked him: 'Are you afraid?

hy are you shaking?! He says, ‘Well, T'm not afraid: I'm not
shaking. But why should I be caught like an idiot...‘ His
pseudonym is 'ANUD' and his last name is SVEXCHANSKIY. Well,
I'll give you all this later."

NOSENKO told CIA on 14 February 1964 that SVENCHANSKIY was
recruited in 1961 and that in 1963 he, NOSENKO, had taken over
the handling of this agent from Tourist Department case officer
Ye, N, NOSKOV.* SVENCHANSKIY hed sent the KG3 many open code
messages such as those described ekove, and a number of these
messages have been considered to have been of definite opera-
tional interest. NOSENKO identified SVENCHANSKIY as the presi-
dent of “Afton Tours” in New York City and the owner of a
Russian-language bookstore in Chicago.

There was some concern on the part of the KGB at the time
of the recruitment in 1960 or 1961, NOSENKXO reported on 1 March
1965, because SVENCHANSKIY nad had contacts with AMTORG in New
York City. The KGB suspected he was an FBI agent, but in con-
tacting SVENCHANSKIY in 1960 or 1961, NOSKOV decided that this
was not so and therefore recruited him. (Asked how it was de-
termined that SVENCHANSKIY was not an FBI agent, NOSENKO re-
plied: "NOSKOV felt it;" he had no further explanation.) The
recruitment was based mainly on an agreement that Inturist
would send more business to SVENCHANSKIY if he cooperated.
NOSENKO also said SVENCHANSKIY had been arrested for black-
marketeering, but he did not elaborate on this statement.-
NOSENKO took over the case from NOSKOV in September 1963, and
His name was entered ‘in the single-volume file of SVENCHANSKIY
as the handling officer as of that date. Together with NOSKOV,
BOSENKO subsequently had two meetings with SVENCHANSKIY when

KGB with "good, solid isformacion™ with “very valuasle material
for technical intelligence;”" at the same time the agent had bes:
asking to be repatriated to the USSR, to become a Soviet citi
but the KGB had been putting him off in orser to continue to
exploit his access, Since the amount and quality of the agent's
production hed recently deteriorated, the KGS decided to accede
to his request for repatriation. Now, however, the acent de-
clined, sayirg that “he was not ready to go just yet. First he

g This by itself appeared suspicious to the KGB, but
in addition, it was t this time that the agent ceme into con-
tact with KCTEN NOS. O learned from BARKOVSKIY that KOTEN
"used to go to some booxstore that sells Soviet literatura and
through a saleslady in this story whom KOTEY knows, he became
acquainted with the agent. wi.o also used to go to this store.
After that, he used to meet with the agent without the saleslady.”

On the basis of these incidents the First Chief Directorate
suspected that KOTEU had been directed specifically to this store
in order to meet and “work on" the agent and that, having learned
that the agent had relatives “in Stantsiya Loo, about 17 kilo-
meters from Sochi..., he had evidently received the assignment
(to visit the relatives) from American Intelligence. Evidently
they had gotten on the trail of this agent and were checking on
him." The KGB also had suspicions concerning the relatives,
former kulaks who were still well-off financially. It was known
to the KGB, for example, that the agent had written his sister
in Stantsiye Loo that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union,
and she had replied: "Is there any sense in your coming here?"

KOTEN arrived in Moscow and then travelled to Sochi, From
there he sent a telegram to the agent's sister and her husband
in’ Stantsiya Loo, asking them to come to Sochi to see him. When
they arrived at XOTE!'s hote!. however, the hotel aduiaistrator
told them that “OTEN was on an excursion and refused to allow
@ meeting. KXOTIN then tock it upon himself to travel to Stant-
siya Loo where he eventually contacted and spoke to the rela-
tives, In the course of. this meeting KOTEN took photographs
of the sister and her husband and recorded a message from the
sister to the agent on a tape recorder he had brought along.
From this the KGB deduced that "U.S. Intelligence wants to get
documentary data" and it therefore decided to “try to get hold
of KOTEN."

There had already been some indication during KOTEN's
earlier trips to the USSR that he was a homosexual, but the
KGB had taken no action because KOTEN was believed to be a
loyal Communist Party member. With these recent developments,
the situation had now changed, Although NOSENKO's superiors
were absent from KGB Headquarters at the time, immediate action
was required. NOSENKO consequently “took the whole thing on
myself because everybody got excited. Everybody said: ‘Let's
go. American Intelligence is active, none of our bosses are
here, the situation is right, the decision must be made right

© 8. “Arrest: of BARGHOORN.
as Information. from XOSENKO

At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO
described the provocation and arrest of Yale University
Professor Frederick BARGHOORN in ‘late 1963; he was ques-
tioned farther on this case on 3 February 1964 and again ’
whilo waiting in Frankfurt to leave for the United Statos. 3
NOSENKO's most corprehensive statement, from which the 4
following paragraphs vere largely dravn, was made on 9 June
1964.* On this last occasion NOSENKO said that the pure . g
pose of the KGB oyerntion against BARGHOORN vas to retaliate 7
for persona non grata ection taken against three Soviets
in NGWYOFK City In the case of John W, BUTENSO and to ae
secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet in the . cf
BUTENKO case who was jailed. In Geneva, however, NOSENKO E
maintained that the operation against BARGHOORN “was to
discourage future arrests such as that of IVANOV [the
jailed Soviot], not because of any special importance of
IVANOV himself."

NOSENKO said that in 1963 four EGR First Chief Direc
torate officers assigned to the New York Legal Residency
were caught in operational activity in the United States.
Of the four, three had diplomatic immunity, but one was a
chauffeur and had only a service passport. The three
Soviet diplomats were held three or four hours by the
American authorities and then released. IVANOV, the chauf-—
feur, was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity. **

GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate, )
learned of this arrest probably the next day and was directed
by KGB Chairman SEWICHASTNYY to take "necessary measures," .
GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office NOSENKO; A.G, ah
KOVALENKO, Chief of the Tourist Department; and G.I. GRYAZ=
NOV and Ye.M. RASHCHEPOV, both Deputy Chiefs from the Ameri-
can Department. After explaining the arrest, GRIBANOV
asked what information the Second Chief Directorate had on
any American--U.S, Embassy employee or tourist--that could

‘The detail of NOSENKO's information on the BARGHOORN case }
reflects both the extent of the CIA debriefings and the : t
depth of his knowledge of this case. He did, in fact, fur- "
nish much of this information during his first 1964 meeting
with CIA. NOSENKO was also able to describe at length ’ sees
BARGHOORN's professional background, which gave rise to KGB 7
suspicions of intelligence affiliation, end he provided the
t general outlines of cther operational activity centering rf iz
i around BARGHOORN during his 1963 trip to the Soviet Union.

serve as material for an arrest. RASHCHEPOV and GRYAZNOV ges usbeecue Heeata te
said that at that very moment there were three or four -
American military attaches in Rostov and that, in the

opinion of the American Department, these officers might

be carrying electronic apparatus. It was known that they.

had cameres, that they had been taking photccraphs, and that _
they had been observed taxing notes. If permitted, they

could be arrested in Rostov bezore they took the return

plane to Moscow. GRIBANOV wanted to know what other pos-.
sibilities existed and irstructed the two representatives

of the American Department to write a report on this. He

also told them to request permission to arrest and search

the military attaches.

GRIBANOV then asked what pertinent information was held
by the Tourist Department. He was told that there were re-
latively few American tourists in the Soviet Union at that
time;* these included ®ARGHOORN, who was nentioned to GRI-
BANOV along with one other (name not recalled), -NOSENKO and
KOVALENKO reported, however, that the KGB had no “strong”
materials against them, They were ordered to make an ime
mediate study of the situation and to report back to GRI-~
BANOV as soon as possible.

Returning to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO and
KOVALENKO gathered the entire American Tourist Section in
their office. In a general discussion, it was decided that
BARGHOORN was the only American on whom the KGB had anything
worth consideration, All the materi@ls or BARGHOORN were
gathered together, and NOSENKO znd KOVALENKO took them to
GRIBANOV, explaining that he was the only possibility.
GRIBANOY read all the materials and was pleased with then;..
he was sure that BARGHOORN was connected with American
Intelligence. He then asked what could be done, NOSENKO
and KOVALENKO reported that BARGHOORN was then in Tbilisi
and that, in fact, Ye.N. NOSKOV (case officer, American
Tourist Section) was in Tbilisi with a woman doctor from
the KGB Operational Technical Directorate for the purpose
of working against BAPRGHOORN; the doctor had some special
item which had been used to make BARGROORN so violently sick
to his stomach that he had to be hospitalized. While he
was in the hospital, a careful search had been made of his
belongings, but nothing of operational interest had been
found. In addition, a KGB agent was placed in BARGHOORN's
room as a patient; he made anti-Soviet statements ard offered
BARGHOORN "materials," but BARGHOORN did not rise to the
bait. At the time of this meeting with.GRIBANOVY, BARGHOORN
was scheduled to fly from Tbilisi to Moscow the following H : serine!
ning, and the KGB knew from a phone tap that he had an
appointment with Theodore ORCHARD of the British Embassy
at the Hotel Metropol the following evening. .

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving |
"materials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow. NOSENKO said that this :
would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that this made . i

to locate an agent who could be used to pass the damaging’
materials to BARGHOORN and told them to write a sunmary of. Feet ae
BARGHOORN's background with. a proposal that the Second : i S
Chief Directorate arrest him “when he obta materials

which are of ‘interest to American Intelligence." This was

to be sent in letter form to SEMICHASTNYY over GRIBANOV'S

signature; the letter was not ‘to indicate how BARGHOORN

was to receive the materials (i.e., the-fact of provocation

was not to be mentioned).

GRIBANOV took a one-page letter on BARGHOORN, along “ siceat
with a similar letter from GRYAZNOY and RASHCHEPOY con~
cerning the military attaches, to SEMICHASTNYY. While
the four--NOSENKO, KOVALENKO, GRYAZNOY ard KOVALENKD=~
were waiting in GRIBANOV's office for his return, GRYAZNOV
received a telephone call from the local KCB organization
in Rostov informing him that the military attaches were in
the air on their way back to Moscow. Shortly thereafter,
GRIBANOV returned with the news that the Chairman of the KGB
had approved the arrests of the military attaches as well
as BARGHOORN. {KHRUSICHEV was absent fron Moscow at the
time, but SEMICHASTNYY had called BREZHNEV and secured his
approval.*)

When GRIBANOV learned from GRYAZNOV that the military
attaches were already on their way back to Moscow, he be~
came furious and sent GRYAZNOV out "to do the job or die.”
Meanwhile, arrangements were made with the “Department pv
(the KGB element responsible for disinformation, subordinate
to the First Chief Directorate) to provide some materiuls
on rockets which could be passed to BARGHOORN. While these
were being picked up, NOSENKO and KOVALENKO returned to
their office to plan the provocation.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance upon
his arrival in Moscow. At 1810 hours a radio message was
received from one of the surveillance cars that BARGHOORN
had gone to the U.S, Embassy, and it was decided that the
agent (name not recalled, aged 25 to 30 years) would be
placed in contact with him as soon as he came out. The
KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appointment with ORCHARD of the
British Embassy at 1900 hours, but at 1900 hours a report
was received that BARGHOORN had left the U.S. Embassy in
the American Ambassador's car. He was alone but for the
Soviet driver. Nothing could be done while BARGHOORN was in
the moving car. A check on ORCHARD established that he was
in the downstairs hall of the hotel waiting. It was there-
fore decided to approach BARGHOORN when he left the car at
the hotel.

*NOSENKO placed these events on the day before BARGHOORN re-
turned to Moscow from Tbilisi and on the day before BARGHOORN

was arrested. As indicated below, BARGHOORN returned from :
Alma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October 1963 and was arrested on He

. BARGHOORN had taken only one or two steps when he was
seized by NOSKOV and Petr POPTSOV, another case officer of
; . the American Tourist Section, and told he was under arrest.
_. .& surveillance car pulled up. BARGHOORN was placed in the
ear, handcuffed (on GRIBANOV's orders, because the Soviets
arrested in the United States had received similar treat-
ment) and driven to the 50th Section of the Militia, where
a@ room had been prepared. 2 ‘

L.I. YEFREMOV and K,G, KRUPNOV from the American
Tourist Section were waiting at the Militia station, KRUPNOV
to interrogate RARGHOORN and YEFREMOV to be the interpreter.
When BARGHOORN was brought into the station, an “incident
report" form was filled out, and a resolution was prepared
requesting permission to hold him 48 hours. Between 0200
and 0300 hours BARGIIOORN was taken to the KGB inner prison.
At 0400 hours the Tourist Department case officers were
released with instructions to report for duty at 0930
hours. NOSENKO and the others went home.

|... sy, KRUPNOV began the questioning in Russian at 1000 .
hours the next day. Although BARGHOORN speaks good Russian,
YEFREMOV remained in case he would be needed to interpret.
NOSENKO entered the room several times during these sessions.
(Although NOSENKO did not want to reveal his face to BARG-
HOORN because he knew BARGHOORN would be released, GRIBANOV
? had. told KOVALENKO that NOSENKO should be there when they
reached the point where BARGHOORN was to tell how he obtained
‘ : the damaging materials.) The first sessions concentrated
on’ general matters, such as BARGHOORN's life history.*

- After one and one half hours of questioning, BARGHOORN
agreed that the materials were on him when he was arrested,
but he maintained that they had been placed on his person.
.He said that he thought they were "newspapers or something,"
‘“that' he did not know what they were. The closed package
was’then opened and shown to BARGHOORN: it contained about
*20 to 25 pages of information on missiles. ."BARGHOORN

;Was not, of course, given a close look" at the materials.

__—...:-__ -*Im_October 1966, NOSENKO stated his certainty that he had
been present on the day after the arrest. At this interro-
:gatfon NOSENKO said KRUPNOV quest ioned BARGHOORN "concerning
‘personal background, employment, etc." “Then NOSENKO asked 2
aT ee whether he had had the incriminating materials

ig person atthe time of his arrest, When BARGHOORN
idmitted this, NOSENKO left. As noted below, BARGHOORN
mentation. peported that the materials were not discussed at this: par-

cote interrogation. 7



“the CIA interviewer then read. to him the eee! stich fixed
the date of the approach as 5 January 1962, the date contained
in NOSENKO's notes, and indicated that NOSDUKO used the name

ae NIKOLAYEV. (see below). Acknowledging that “maybe”. he had used
the name Georgiy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV with. JOHNSON, NOSENKO
said: “I don't know why I made this mistaxe with the dates. I
think it (the approach) was the first or second day that -I was in
the Seventh (Tourist) Department. I saw myself that he had
(homosexual) intercourse... Your date is absolutely right, but
this reminded me that it was soon after I had come in the
Seventh (Tourist) Department. Is this important?"

Question: How long had you been in the Seventh Department?

NOSENKO: - Now I remember that it was immediately - one or two i
days. I know I returned in January 1962, I, knew I :
would be going to the Seventh’ (Department) alréady in
December. I was visiting the Seventh already then.

I had not ‘too many papers to turn over to the First ©

(American Department), and now I remember that I i
moved to the Seventh immediately (NCSENKO's emphasis} :
after 1 January 1962.

b. Information from JOHNSON

JOHNSON reported to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on 5 January
1962 that he experienced an “incident with Soviet plainclothes-
men in the Hotel Metropol earlier that day."  JCHNSON, who H
arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961, told the consular officer j
that "he was dining alone in the Hotel Metropol restaurant the '
evening of 4 January when he was joined at his table by a Soviet +
citizen who identified himself as a doctor from Riga. (This
was NOSENKO‘s homosexual agent VOLKOY.) According to JOHNSON,
little conversation transpired because the Riga ‘doctor’ spoke
English poorly. wefore JOHNSON left, however, the ‘doctor'
said he would like to chat with him and knew a student who
spoke English well. JOHNSON then agreed to come by the ‘doc-
tor’s' room at the Metropol at 10:00 a.m. the next day, JOHNSON
said that he dropped by the ‘doctor's' recom about 10:00 the
morning of January 5. Soon after he entered, the ‘doctor’ and
his ‘student' friend (NOSENKO's homosexual agent YEFREMOV) ‘
began to make homosexual advances to him. He stated that he i
protested and was rising to leave when two plainclothesmen
suddenly appeared in the room and announced that all were under |
arrest. JOHNSON was then taken to another room where he was i
asked to sign a statement in Russian... He signed this state- je. :
: ment and was taken to a man in a third room who identified him- eeieteeeiaaa
: self as the Chief of Police, Georgiy Ivanovich NIKOLOV.* The
police chief first iold him that Soviet law had been violated
and that he, JOHNSON, could be imprisoned for three, five, or
perhaps even eight years. After proceeding in this vein for

5. Attempt to Recruit BRAUNS

a. Information from NOSENKO:

NOSENKO made the following statement or 2 February 1964:

"In 1962 some U.S. citizen by the name of Horst BRAUNS came to
the Soviet Union. I mentioned him to you in 1962 but at that
time could not recall his nane.* we tried to recruit him but
did not succeed. He lived somewhere in Leningred, and in 1942
he went back with the German troops to &: ny. And he served
in the.German Army, and after the war Le chanjed his neme end

Following BARGHOORN's admission, another resolution
was drawn up by KRUPNOV and signed by KRUFNOV, KOVALENKG,

and GRIBANOV. NOSEN&O and KAUPNOV then took it to the office
of the Chief Prosecutor where the incident report, the first
interrogation, and the first and second resolutions were
reported to (fnu) MISHUTIN (or MISHUSTIN), the First Deputy
to the Chief Prosecutor. GRIBANOV further directed that all
materials on EARGHOORN, including information from KGB
Archives, be given to the Department of Prosecution of the
KGB so that they could begin the legal proceedings against
BARGHOORN, After this, all-interrogations were conducted
by this department; KRUPNOV. was dropped from the case,

but YEFREMOV continued to act as interpreter.

b. Information from BARGHOORN

BARGHOORN, who had made five earlier trips to tho
Soviet Union since 1955, arrived there on 2 October 1963.
The purpose of his visit, as stated in his visa application,
was to gather information for a book on how effectively the
Soviet Union was operating as a result of its political ed-
ucation and political system. His itinerary took hin to
Leningrad fron 2 to 7 October, to Moscow from 7 to 10 Octo~
ber, Tbilisi from 10 to i7 October, and short visits to
Tashkent, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Alma-Ata from 17 to 25
October. He flew from Alma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October and
was scheduled to leave for Warsaw on 31 October. On the
latter date he was arrested and held by tne KGB until
16 November when, at President Kennedy's intervention, he
was released and left the Soviet Union. BARGHOORN had no
intelligence mission. anaes

Upon his return to the United States, BARGHOORN was
debriefed by the U.S, Department of State and by CIA. His
information indicated a high degree of KGB operational in~
terest in him throughout the trip, including. encounters with
at least five probable KGB agents during his first week
there: an attractive waitress who invited him to “do the
town," a disenchanted intellectual in Leningrad, an attrac~
tive unattached girl who sat next to him on the flight from
Moscow to Tbilisi, and two young Armenians whom he met his
first day in Tbilisi.* The two Armenians were instrumental
in the drugging described by NOSENKO. At dinner’ in his
hotel on the day he arrived in Tbilisi, BARGHOORN met 8
young man claiming to be a student at the Leningrad Music
Conservatory. They left the hotel for a walk and ran into
a friend of the student, a second young Armenian, and the
three of them went to a cafe for coffee. None was available,

*Questioned about this in February 1965, NOSENKO said that
BARGHOORN, as a suspected American Intelligence agent, wes
of operational interest throughout the trip. He vaguely re-
called the girl on the plane but either did not know or had.
forgotten details of any other specific activity. NOSENKO
-said that none of this activity was @irectly re: ed to the
bah eaiane operation, which was: based ona. last-minute de-:
cision. vo : E



but the young student went to the kitchen "to arrange things,"
and shortly thereafter "three foul-tasting coffees” appeared.
Within an hour, BARGHOORN was in the hospital, acutely-ill.

He wags assigned, to a room where. there was another patient, +
and a woman doctor took care of his.case. He was in the i
hospital for four days. During this period his clothes,-

notes, and other possessions were held by hospital authori~ -

ties. ‘

Upon his return to Moscow by air on 25 October, BARG-
HOORN checked into the Metropol Hotel. The next six days : 4
were occupied by sightseeing and appointments connected with t
his research. ‘In the late afternoon of 31 October he called ‘
on friends at the U.S, Embassy for cocktails, and at. 1910,
already 10 minutes late, he left in the Ambassador's car for
a dinner appointment (prearranged by telephone) et the Metro-
pol. with Theodore ORCHARD, a British diplomat.

BARGHOORN's account of the subsequent events closely
parallels NOSENKO's. Having been handed the incriminating
materials, he was arrested, handcuffed, and taker to Militia
Station No. 58, where he was questioned briefly by a uni-
formed Militia officer, The KGB was called. Within 30
minutes a KGB captain (BARGHOORN thought his name night
have been GORBUNSKIY) arrived and began to question him,
assisted by an interpreter named YEFREMOV.* All question
were asked in Russian, and BARGHOOKRN answered most of them
in English. The package of materials was opened and con-
tained, according to BARGHOORN, 13 or 14 photographs of
rockets, This session lasted until about midnight and
centered around BARGHOORN'’s possession of the photographs
and his “intelligence mission." He was then taken to the
Lyubyanka prison.

Interrogations were conducted the next morning by the
original KGB officer together with his "chief," whom BARG-
HOORN subsequently identified by photograph as NOSENKO. The
questioning concerned BARGHOORN's biography, and nothing was
asked about the compromising materials. The following day
the case was turned over to a KGB colonel identified as (fnu)
PETRENKO, and BARGHOORN did not see NOSENKO or the other KGB
officer again. At this and subsequent sessions, BARGHOORN
was questioned further concerning the circumstances of his
arrest. BARGHOORN described NOSENKO as “clever and quick-
witted" and as giving "the impression that he was not a
dedicated careerist, but opportunistic and adaptive; he.
seemed not to care about what he was doing, but doing a good
job nevertheless."

*Asked why YEFREMOV used his true name during the interro-
gations, NOSENKO said this was necessary for legal reasons,
that he had to sign documents connected. with the interroga-
tions. BARGHOORN confirmed that.-YEFREMOV had participated
throughout the.entire series of.interrogations and had
signed interrogation reports attesting to the accuracy of
translation, e

10. BOLSHAKOV, Robert Kennedy, and the Cuban Missile Crisis
a. Introduction aie

NOSENKO volunteered at his second meeting with CIA
in January 1964 that G.N, BOLSHAKOY was his “old friend" i
and that he was a colonel in the GRU. On. 26 January, _
1 February, and 19 August 1964 he again raised BOLSHAKOV’s ‘
name, emphasizing that he was a GRU officer and a "good
friend.“ In the 1 February interview, after displaying an.
initial reluctance to discuss with CIA such a “sensitive”
subject, he provided a number of details on BOLSHAKOV's
alleged relationship in 1962 with the then Attorney General,
Robert Kennedy. His information on this subject, he said,
derived from his friendship with BOLSHAXOV in Moscow, where
BOLSHAKOV was reassigned (in December 1962 following a tour
in Washington as Novosti correspondent and editor of tke
magazine USSR). XOSENKO claimed a personal role in this
affair, in that' he personally proposed to the KGB. leader-
Ship that the KGB. take over BOLSHAKOV's former (GRU) con-
‘tact with Robert Kennedy.

NOSENKO claimed that an information channel of con-
munication between BOLSHAKOV and -the Attorney Ceneral had
developed at Kennedy's initiative. He described in detaii
the circumstances of their introduction at & social function
by a journalist (whom he did not name). He said that he 4
“thought" that the Kennedys knew that BOLSHAKOV was a 4 Seaa
“military intelligence officer," and he implied that they
regarded these private conversations with BOLSHAKOV as a
useful instrument of diplomacy. According to NOSENKO, the
KGB knew that CIA was not aware of this relationship-~it
was "obvious" that Robert Kennedy wanted it that way.
NOSENKO claimed that after BOLSHAKOV left the United States
“during the Cuban missile crisis,"* no one took over his -
role as a confidential channel to the White House. After i !
the assassination of the President, NOSENKO continued, the
Kennedy family tried to reestablish the relationship through
their close triend, the artist William. WALTON, during the
latter's visit to Moscow in December 1963, NOSENKO reported
that he had urged that the KGB try to take over the Robert
Kennedy operation from the GRU and that he hed proposed two
plans which would have enabled this to take place, the :
second involving WALTON. Neither came to fruition, however. .
g to the Cuban missile crisis, NOSENKO said that the
"played dirty" with BOLSHAKOV by forcing him to "tell THEE ae
Robert" that there were no offensive missiles in Cuba. whereas
there actually were such weapons there.

According to other sources, BOLSHAKOV left Washington
for Moscow on 3 August 1962 and returned on 2 October 1962.
On 23 August, about the time that CIA was reporting urgently
to the President that "something new and different" was
going on with respect to Soviet aid to Cuba, Ambassador
DOBRYNIN assured Theodore SORENSEN (Special Counsel to the
President) that the United States had no need to fear Soviet

for Soviet sourcss at this time, NOSENKO stated on several

not had luck in getting intelligence from high places in
the U.S. Government" in Octobex 1462, On sore than one oc
casion he said that the KUR agent “SASIIA"** was unable to ©

c. | NOSENKO's Statements on BOLSHAKOV

NOSZENKO repeatedly emphasized BOLSHAKOV's GRU affilia-
tion and the fact that the KGB was in no way involved in
this channel to the U.S. Government via Robert Kennedy.

He first volunteered BOLSHAKOV's naze during a discussion
of the use of Novosti a: cover organization for Soviet ©
Intelligence officers. Yuriy BOLSHaKOV of the GRU also
sits there," he said. We ig a colonel and a friend of
mine." Two days later, out of context with the preceding
discussion, he introduced the name again: “Then there is
this BOLSHAKOV. He is from GRU ‘who was in the United
States.” NOSENKO then cormented that this was “a very in-
teresting case" and added: “We shall talk about it later." i
When his case ofizicer tnereupon turned to another tcpic,

NOSENKO immediately interrupted to say: “I know BOLSHAKOV

very well, He is ny old friend.,.J met him through Yuriy

GUK,..[wholwas with him in the United States...and we are

now very good friends, He calls ne up and consults me for

advice..." On 1 February 1964 NOSENKO said he thought the

Kennedy family knew BOLSHAKOV to be a military inteiligence

officer; “yet for some reason they chose hin" as a channel

between the U.S, and Soviet Go ments, BOLSHAKOV, NO-

SENKO added, “reported directly” to the Chief of the GRU

concerning his exchanges with Robert Kennedy.

NOSENKO said BOLSHAKOV was introduced to Robert Kennedy
by an American journalist (unnamed) at 2 reception in the
United States. The journalist invited BOLSHAKOV to go for
a walk, and as they strolled “down an alley," there was a
man sitting on a bench directL ahead of them. "The jour-
nalist said; ‘Listen, Ceorge [BOLSHAKOV], are you acquainted
with Robert Kennedy, the brother of tho President and the
Chief of the Department of Justice?! BOLSHAKOV said: ‘No.
Of course, I have heard of him,’ ‘Would like me to
introduce you?' ‘Of course,’ BOLSKAKOV said, ‘please do.' .
He led him to the man on the bench, There was this feeling :
that all this had been pre-srranged.” ‘

This contact"was at the personal desire of Bob Kennedy...
BOLSHAKOV was called in for this. As you know, the whole '
idea of this contact was to pass information to Kennedy
from KIPUSECHEV and from Kennedy to KHRUSHCHEV....It happened
to be BOLSHAKOV, but it was not BOLSHAKOV who sought to
have the meeting....Then the relationship grew. BOLSHAKOV
was_a visitor in Robert Kennedy's house They would first
talk about ordinary things, and t “the conversation
turned to other matters...Robert Kennedy did not say:
"Please tell KHRUSHCHEY so-and-so.' He would say: "You
know, some of these problems seen insolvable."" And BOL-
SHAKOV would say: ‘And you know, at home they think this 1
and that way. without actually saying that this was coming i
from KHRUSHCHEV. But, of course, this was clear without i4
explanations. It was ar exchange of views on important. poil-. }

tical questions of the moment. He was like an intermediate
point..." NOSENKO commented that he personally thought

that it was a "case of mutual ‘feelers’ being sent out by i :
both sides--exploring some given current political situation.”

After BOLSHAKOV left Washington, KOSENKO stated,
replaced. as a chanrel to the U.S. Government. Asked:
whether Z HUK could: have taken over "upon BOLSHAKOV's.



departure, NOSENKG said: Oh, no... There is no contact.
like there was before. It was broken at the time BOL-
SHAKOV left, ZINCNUY was an agent or & cooptce....No,
there is no such contact since BOLSHAKOY left. He passes
no more messages.”

Referring to the Kennedy-BOLSHAKOV contacts, NOSENKO
told CIA on 26 January 1964: “You have shown. considerable
interest in him !BOLSIAKOV], even after his return to the
Soviet Union...because all this was done by by-passing CIA."
He said on 1 February 1964: “It was pretty obvious~that
this relationship between BOLSHAKOV and Robert Kennedy had
nothing to do with C1A, and CIA was not witting of it. “It
was at the perscnal desire of Bob Kenredy."” The KGB
determined that CIA was ureware of the exchange between
Kennedy and BOLSHAXOV, NOSENKO reported, beceuse when BOL-
SHAKOV was subsequently invited to a reception at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow, two CIA officers--Kenneth A, KERST and
Malcolm A, TOON*—-tried to elicit information from him
about his relatiorship with President Kennedy. "The most.
important thing" they had tried to find out, according to
NOSENKO, was whether the President and BOLSHAKOV had met
personally. Although BOLSHAKOV did-not adait the fact to
them, he did have one meeting with President Kennedy--"he
was brought in a car...and was taken through a back door
into the White House," NOSENKO said.

NOSENKO reported that William WALTON visited Moscow “in Decen—

ber 1963 and at that time went to BOLSHAKOV, whom he had

“previously met at the home of Robert Kennedy. Part of
their conversations, he continued, related to Robert Kennedy's

future political plans: ‘WALTON said that Bobby...did not
expect at present to become a candidate for the vice presi-
dency. He was, perhaps, according to WALTON, thinking of
running for Governor of Massachusetts..." NOSENKO said he
felt that there were "some feelers sent out on the part of
WALTON~-not exactly questions, but just a passing of opinion.
WALTON was trying to sound them out, but I think that every-
thing was left without an answer....My personal opinion was
that these things were told to WALTON so that ke could pass
them on as, so to speak, Bouby's plans for the future."
Another topic covered in the WALTON-~BOLSHAKOV discussions,
NOSENKO added, was the assassination of President Kennedy.**
“As I remember, it was WALTON's opinion-eand his opinion re-
flected the opinion of the Kennedy family--that there was

no Russian involvement in the murder of the President. No —

suspicion at all."

NOSENKO proposed two plans whereby the KGB could take
over the GRU's channel to President: Kennedy. Under the
first of these plans, the Soviet Minister of Justice would
personally invite the Attorney Gencral to come’to the Soviet
Union. There the KGB would “set him up in private. living
quarters, give him everything he wants...so that he would be.

NOSENKO conceived his second plan during WALTON's trip to

Moscuw in December 19¢ “BOLSHAKOY told mo that ho was

going to reet WALTON, and asked me whether ve bad an ins

NOSENKO indicated that If the KGB had actualiy essuned
authority for the operation in Moscow droa the GRU, as he

had proposed, the KGB Legal Pesidency in Washington would
nave then taken over, and "someone new” probably would have
nt from KGR Headqu ers to develop the association.

319.

1.° Rank

NOSENKO has. been questioned at length concerning his
*. progress tnrough the KGB ranks, from lieutenant to lievten-
‘ant colonel. He has volunteered additional information on
this subject himself. iis various statements follow in
-chronological order,

11 June 1962: "As a Chief of Section, I now receive
2,500° [rubles per month}, plus 700 for my rank, for major,
plus pay for longevity. ! receive more t:.an 4000, i.e.,
450-470-480 [rubles per month] in new money, This is
enough for me...I am now a major but I should receive
lieutenant colonel soon. I have already completed my time
in grade. We have a system of tine in grade. From major
to lieutenant colonel it is necessary to have four years...
My timo -in grade was up “in December, in December of last ~
year [1961]."

23: January 1964: At the first of his 1964 meetings
with CYA Yn Geaeva NOSENKO had in his possession the ten-
porary duty authorization which he said he had been issued
in December 1963 to travel zrom Moscow to Gorkiy Oblast in
connection with the search for CHEREPANOV.* This official
KGB paper had been signed by O.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the
Second Chie? Directorate, and authorized. "Licutenant Colonel
Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO to visit the local KGB organiza~
tion in Gorkiy Oblast on official business between 15 and
30 December 1963." It bore official stamps of arrival and
departure in December 1963, as attested by officials in the
town of Shakhunya.

10 February 1964: In Frankfurt, while awaiting ex-
filtration to the United States, NOSENKO was asked to review
a biographic statement which had been prepared by his case
officers on the basis of statements he had made during the
1962 and 1964 mectings in Geneva. NOSENKO went over the
biography carefully, noted several changes, and then stated
that it was correct. The biography included the information
that NOSENKO had served in the U.S. Embassy Section of the
American Department as a senior lieutenant from 1952 [sic]
to 1955, that he was promoted to. captain in 1956, to major
in 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963, shortly
before leaving Moscow for Geneva.

8 April 1964: NOSENKO was questioned about the date
when he became a senior lieutenant, and he replied: "I
think in the end of '53 or the beginning of '54 I got the
senior lieutenant."

Question: That's less than a year after you entered the
service [KGB].

*See Part VI.D.7.c. for a.description of this search and
of NOSENKO’s claimed part in it.

NOSENKO: I don't remember. You see, they are not given

scheduled time passes before they give it. So,

16 June 1964: Asked to list in chronological order the
date ST-HIg promotions within the KGB from the date of ait

entry, NOSENKO stated “] began in the GRU as a junior
lieutenant. While in the GRY I became a lieutenant, and I
entered the KGB with this rank in 1953, Not long after I
entered the KGB I became a senior lieutenant, but 1 don't
know the month. It was still 1953. In 1956 I was promoted
to the rank of captain. 1 don't know the month. I became
a major in 1959, I don't know the’month. In October 1963
I wr made @ lieutenant colonel....Personnel called me on
the welephone and said I had been promoted, Later I was
told that GRIBANOV wanted to see me. I went to his office,
but, of course, I didn't let hin know that I already knew
that I had been promoted. He gave me his congratuiations.
You never see the attestation. It goes into your official
file."

26 January 1965: While discussing his role as case
officer tor U.S. Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN,
NOSENKO volunteered out of context that he had never offi-
cially been a major. He explained this situation as
follows: Having been promoted to the rank of senior
lieutenant in April 1953, he vecame eligible for the rank
of captain in 1956, When this time came, however, he was
not promoted because a senior KGB official held against
him his illegal use of KGB documents to cover_treatment for
gonorrhea in 1954. or
Jieutenant until 1959, when. he would have been eligible
for promotion to the rank of major had he received his
captaincy on schedule. Although GRIBANOV had promised NO-

SENKO that he would be promoted directly from senior lieu-

tenant to major, skipping the rank of captain, an admini-

strative error was made by the KGB Personnel Office, and

NOSENKO found when the orders were issued that he had in~ : rm
stead been promoted only to captain. Instead of rectifying

this mistake, GRIBANOV persuaded NOSENKO that it would be

to his advantage to remain a captain until he became eligible

for promotion to lieutenant colonel in 1963. NOSENKO- there—

fore was a captain from September or October 1959 until

October 19643 when; as promised by GRIBANOV, he was promoted



@irectly to ths rank [of “Licutenant colonel. -“Tn“this manner: it
turned out that he never officially held the rank of major.*

10 August 1965: Under questioning by. DERYABIN, NOSENKO
repeated the chronology of his promotions given an 26 January
1965. He again explained that he:was put, up for captain in
1956, but this time said that the-promotion had been blocked
on the grounds that he should be made to wait because of
shortcomings in his work. Asked why he-had told CIA that he
had been a major during the 1962 meetings and again in the
biography prepared in Frankfurt, NOSENKO replied that he
thought the true story would not be believed.

{
t

17 April 1966; Ia a voluntary statement, NOSENKO wrote

the following: To March 1951, with the rank of junior lieu- ‘

tanant, I started service in Naval Intelligence of the Seventh :

Flect in Sovetskaya Gavan....From August 1952 until 1953, -3 - reifeseteretete Gaz

ant colonel] ond the travel erder which you know of, with the
rank of lieutenant colorncl, was filled out erroneously.**

19 April 1966: In a new version of hig eutobiography,
NOSENKO includéd the following statement: "in July 1956 1 -
became a candidate member of the CPSU, soon after which I re=
ceived a promotion at work: I became a senior case officer
and was given the rank of senior licutenant. In August 1957
I was accepted into the CPSU, and during the second half of
1958 was appointed Deputy Chief of the: Second Section, Seventh
Department. On 29 Decembex 1959 1 was promoted to the rank of
captain,  aanaicat

26 October 1966: "I lied when I said I was a lieutenant
colonel in 196% Twas only a captain." Asked why he had
+ Said in 1962 that he was then a major, NOSENKO replied:
“There was no conversation about rank in 196 About my po~
sition, I said I was in the Tourist Department. That's all." jj

To summarize what NOSENKO has said about his ranks while
: ‘serving in the KGB: He became a senior iicutenant in 1952, ‘ a
April 1953, 1954, or 1956; a captain in 1956 or September/Octo— : oH
ber/December 1959: a major in December 1958 or 1959; and a A
lieutenant colonel in October/November 1963, (The latter terreeer 7
claim was verified by the official KGB document listing him as
a lieutenant colonel as of December 1963.) On tho other hand,
NOSENKO has indicated that his highest rank in’ the KGB vas tee .
captain, and that he never advanced to a majority or a lieu- - ;
tenant colonelcy.

*At about this time, in early 1965,

NOSENKO was only a captain and had advanced to nis s

KGB position. because of his-close. relationshjp with GRIBANOY,. -

2. Awards and Decoration:

i Not long after reestablishing contact with CIA-in
January 1964, NOSENKO mentioned that he had received the

“shortly after the 1962 meetires" in Geneva

{as a reward for the ideas which he had developed to Men-.
large the experience and improve the quality” of KGB Second
Chief Directorate staff .personnel in Moscoy.* During the
first series of interrogations, .NGSENKO on 6 April 1964.
‘Claimed that he was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1963 for:
his work in the Tourist Department, KGB Second Chief Direc=
torate, after receiving the Order of the Red Banner in 1962
for his performances while in the American Department.

The following discussion of the subject took place on
6 April 1964:

NOSENKO: Yes;~I-received a big gold nedal. -—-- - ad
Question: It was the Order of Lenin?

NOSENKO: It was at first the Order of the Red Ranner-~the
Red Star, I mean. In ‘63 I received the Order
of Lenin. In '63.

Question: What for?

NOSENKO: GRIBANOV decided that whoever is working a long

barranevennnceras period in tie Second Chief Directorate--[V.D.]
CHELNOKOV got one, [A.G.] KOVALENKO got one-=
many, many [received the Order of Lerin].**

Question: You received the Order of Lenin for this brilliant
service?

NOSENKO: No. For working in the Seventh [Tourist] Depart-
ment, which is considered good.

Question: What is good? Were there recruitments? What
recruitments?

NOSENKO; You must know that the main task of the Seventh
Department is rot recruitments. The main task is
countering the intelligence activities of the op-
position.

Question: So, the Chief and the Deputy Chief of the Seventh
— Department got the Order of Lenin?

NOSENKO: Yes.

*NOSENKO has described the Order of Lenin as the highest
decoration for which a KGB officer can be eligible.

##In June 1964 NOSENKO said that the only Second Chief Direc~.
torate officer whom he knew to have. received this avard was
V.A. CHURANOV, Chief of the British Embassy Section, who re=
-eruited William John VASSALL (see PART. VI.D.5.b.). On the

NOSENKO admitted on 8 April 19643 ‘In 1964 {in ‘Goneval

boast," NOSENKO.then explained what he said to be the true
circunstances and gave.the reason for whioh he wes to have
received this: decoration, GRIBANOV, NOSENKO stated, had-
promised in 1983 that NOSENKO, CHRLNOXOV) and KOVALENKO . f
would get the Order of Lenin: “He aaid: “'T am submitting

create in touriat work.' But December [1963] had gone bye

I left [for Goneva] and nothing happoaed,"*

NOSENKO wes agked on 15 April 1964 to list the dates,
reasons, and types of awards, decorations, and bonuses he
had received during his KGB career, as well ag to indicate
from whom he hed received each of these. Hie reply waa
ag follows: "I received nothing in 1883, 1854, and 1955,

ment operations end NOSENKO'‘s ‘role in them. NOSEXKO also
said during interrogation by DERYASIN-on 10 August 1965
that, in 1959, his name was submitted for the Order of the
Red Banner in connection with these recruitments, but that
he did not get it, probably because he was transferred to
the First Department at that time (January 1950). NOSENKO
has described the Order of the Red Banner as the third
highest award a KGB officer may receive. Asked what KGB
officers had received this award, NOSENKO said on i0 June

.,1964 that GRISANOV, SAKHAROVSKIY, and several other high-
ranking KGB officers were awarded it for the important role
they played in smashing the Hungarian Revolution in 1956,

** On 15 April 1964 NOSENKO had said that he received the
Order of the Red Star, along with a group of other Second
Chief Directorate officers, at the end of December 1962.

He recalled this because they were planning the. presenta-
tion for the enniversary of the KGB on 20 December, but

the presentation was delayed and was not made until the

end of the month. NOSENKO and about 70 other officers of
the Second Chief Directorate, including KOVSHUK and G.I.
GRYAZNOV, received the award “simply for achievements, for
good results in work.” | NOSENKO told DERYASIN in August 1965
that the order accompanying his award had read: “For ex-
ceptional performance of mission.” When asked what mission
was involved, NOSENKO replied that the award was just for
good work in general.

commendation from GRIBANOV for general good work. Also,’
GRIBANOV told me that 1, along with some others, was to
receive the Order of Lenin on 20 December 1963, the KGB
anniversary date, but I left for Gencva.**I was to re-
ceive it for arousing [inspiring] the Seventh Department."

KOSENKO said on 26 October 1966 that he never re-
ceived any KGB award or decoration for his operational
work. The only awards he received during his KGB career,
he said, were a Red Army anniversary medal-and the award
for satisfactory completion of tun years of service.

*NOSENKO's wording here reflects earlier intensive ques=
tioning concernirg the ten-year service medal. NOSENKO said
on 15 April 1964: "In 1962 I had ten years of service in

the KGB and got a medal for unblemished service. It is
usually given for ten years and to KCB men only....That was

in 1962. I hac ten years of service then.“ When it was
pointed out that, according to his: most recent statement,

have had only nine years of service in 1962, NOSENKO said he
did not understand why but that. he was certain that he had
been given the medal. after his return from Geneva in 1962.
(The 1962 date is consistent with NOSENKO's earlier statements
that he joined the KGB in 1952.). The following day, 17 April
1964, NOSENKO said that he remembered why he had received

the medal in 1962 rather than 1963; this medal, he recalled,
is awarded to servicemen as well as KGB officers, and prior |
military service is taken into account in computing the
gervice time for the latter. NOSENKO had: entered the GRU

NOSENKO'S. Relationship with -GRISANOV.

1. “Information from NCSENKO

a. Summary

From the time of his first meetings with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO
maintained that he had a close personal and profetsional relation-
ship with Major General 0.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of tne Second Chief.
Directorate, NOSENKO has described recruitment approaches in. which
he and GRIBANOV took part together, conversations they had on opera-
tional matters, the role which GRIBANOV played in his rank Ppromo~
tions and receipt of various awards, and his.afterhours carousing
with GRIBANOV and First Chief Directorate ccuntcrinteiligence
officer Ye.A, TARABRIN. NOSENKO Has also frequently mentioned the
role which GRIBANOV played in nis, NOSENKO's, professional advance-
ment within the KGa: GRIBANOV was wholly responsible, against
NOSENKO's wishes, for his appoint: tion of Deputy
Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department in
January 1969; later, when NOSENKO rejected his offer to make him
Deputy Chief of the entire American Department, G2IBANOV arranged
his return to the Tourist Department as Chief of the American
Tourist Sectior and his later appointment as Deputy Chief of the
Tourist Department.

NOSENKO's remarks concerning nis direct involvement with
GRIBANOV in operations against Americans are-included in other
parts of this paper. Among them are his early.statements on the
approach to code clerk James STORSSERG (Part V.E.3.c.), bis 1962
account of the arrest and attempt to r. t Cia cfificer Fussel}
LANGELLE (Part Vi.D.7.a.), and his ear ports on the attemp
recruir-CTa officer Edward Ellis SMITH (Part VI.D.2.). In all
three cases NOSENKO subsequently denied having played the role he
originally attributed to himself ané denied having had personal
contact with the Americans involved. NOSENKO has also altered his
original accounts to say that he received no awards or decoration
for operational activity and that he had not received the promo-
tions he claimed.

b. Details

The statements of NOSENKO given below concern primarily his
personal relationship with GRIBANOV and how GRIBANOV assisted
his rapid rise within the organization of the Seccnd Chief Direc~
torate.

12 June 1962: "Oleg Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV is a great guy.
A real pal.” We, so to say, used to meet one ancther illegally
and had women together... GRIBANOV wrote a fitness report on
me. It was the very best that can be given, brilliant, GRIBANOV
wrote the very best fitness report on me. He had an excellent
regard for me, excellent... I am supposed to beccme Deputy Chief
of [the Tourist] Department. I believe that GRIBANOV is promot-
ing young pecple, new people, who already have experience, good
experience, who have made recruitments. .I know two or. three -[of
the people he is moving ahead]. I personally have about 12 re-
eruitments, four-or five of them were British and the rest Ameri-
cans. He [GRIBANOV] has his eye on me in particular, and the
question: of my advancement is right now under consideration... I
will be Deputy Chief of Department. You mist give thought to the

fact that I have been talking with you. You can ruin everything.

I have a career. I have bright prospects. “y boss GRIBANOV, ny
highest boss, has a very high degree of respect. for me. He some-
times bawls me out and I-- Well, I make it look like this is un-
pleasant for me. But, in fact, it is a pleusant thing because, ..
inside, I am glad he is bawling me out and not: someone else. I
know that if he bawls me out he has a high regard for me. He
sometimes calls me personally {to his office} and suys: ‘You
come with me. I have to meet an ambassador.’ I go with him.

We arrive and have the conversation. He is there all night. He
comes out and says: ‘Well, where shall we go for a drink?' I
know beforehand {that he will say this] and everything is ready
at the Aragvi Restaurant. We go there. ‘tell, what shall we
drink!' [GRIBANOY says}. I answer: ‘Well, Oleg Mikhailovich,
cognac, of course! He is the highest chief. ‘I'don't drink
cognac, I'll have vodka,' I say. ‘Well, we'll have vodka then,‘
{GRIBANOV says}..." One of NOSENKO's CIA handlers suggested at
this point that GRIBANOV seemed to treat NOSENKO as an older
brother would, ‘NOSENXO replied: "That's his attituce toward me."

23 April 1964
Question: «Did you ever go to GRIBAKOV's house?
NOSENKO: “I never went in the house. I have driven to it.
Question: Did he ever come to your house?
NOSENKO: No.

Question: Were you ever out at night with him, after work?
If so, how, under what circumstances?

NOSENKO: After work? Yes, once.

Question: Who else was there?
NOSENKO:  TARABRIN.
Question: What was the occasion?

NOSENKO: No specific reason. GRIBANOV called me at midnight.
I could hear that he was already drinking; he asked
me how long it would take me to get dressed and come
down to the Praga Restaurant, first private room.
Afterwards we wanted to go somewhere else to finish
the evening... GRIBANOV was sloppy drunk, lay down
to rest, he needed a couple of hours of sleep. I
@rove him and TARABRIN home, got him there at 6:00
a.m., gave him some pills to help him?

Question: When did you first personally meet GRIBANOV?

NOSENKO: I might have seen him in 1953 or 1954, but I did not
have a chance to speak to him then. Once I was in two
group operational discussions (about 15 people present)

. about work against Military Attaches:.in 1954; that was
the first time I ever spoke to. him. . H

Question: Bee did you first have’ any personal conversation with

NOSENKO: I don't remember. He gathered groups of people,

Maybe I was with him wi KOZLOV and others in Tourist
Department [i.e., between 1955 and 1960}.

Question: When did you develop a personal relationship with him?

NOSENKO: It is difficult to say how it got started. I was

isitiseensianaats still working in the Seventh Department. It was in
1958, or maybe 1957. KOZLOV suddenly called me and
said I should immediately report to GRIBANOV. I did,
and GRIBANOV said.I should quickly be ready to go to
a reception with him at the Indian Embassy, with him
and Vera [Ivanovna] ANDREYEVA. #

Question: Why you?

NOSENKO: I don't know... (pause) Oh, yes, this is the story.

———" this is it, this is why he started favoring me, :
Earlier, some time in 1953, I knew some girls, Nina on
Pokrovskiy Boulevard and her girlfriead, Rina GUDKOVA,
friends of [Yu.I.} GUK and [V.M.] KOVSHUK and [V.A.]}
CHURANOV., CHURANOV was a friend of TARABRIN, who was

a friend of GRIBANOV. Through TARABRIN he got acquainted
with these girls, and TARABRIN brought them to GRIBANOV's

dacha >ne night. The girls were talkative and‘ told me
all about it, and said they'd told CHURANOV. I told
CHURANOV who warned me not to mention it. I never did,
and GRIBANOV learned about this and liked it; he re-
marked once: “You are not a gossiper..."

Question: How did he find out that you knew and didn't tell any-
ee one?

NOSENKO: 1 don't know, but he did.

Question: Who wrote your fitness reports?

NOSENKO: My last one was written by {V.D.] CHELNOKOV. The one
before that by (V.A.] KLYPIN, in the First Department.
Before that in the Seventh Department it was written
by {K.N.] DUBAS, before him by [V.A.] KO2LOV, then
{S.V.}] PERFILYEV and before then, in the First Depart-
ment, by (A.M.] GORBATENKO.

Question: Did GRIBANOV ever write a fitness report on you?

- NOSENKO: He may not have actually written-them, but he signed

them, those reports written in connection with pro-
motions to higher jobs or for trips abroad, or general
reviews of personnel. .

15 February 1965 (from a protocol signed: 20 February 1965):
“Before I joined the KGB in 1953 I had never heard the name of
Oleg Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV and knew nothing about him. As. [F.G.J
SHUBNYAKOV, rather than GRIBANOV, was the Deputy Director of. the:
Second Chief Directorate responsible for supervising the acti-
vities. of the First*Department of the Directorate, where I: worked,



it may have been several months after I began my,.KGS service ‘that
GRIEANOV first came to my attention. JI don't knew when I first’ : a
saw GRIBANOV but it may have been approximately 1953 at.a meeting - ‘ oa
before May Day or the 7 November holiday. I’ would not necessarily i A
remerber this as I frequently met much more important people, who ; }

were friends of my father, and seeing GRIPBANOV wouidn‘t have been i H
particularly important to me. Sometimes during 1953 and 1955, it t :
was necessary to obtain the signature of a Deputy Chief of the

Second Chief Directorate on a cable that I-had written and, if:

SHUBNYAKCY was absent at the time, I would take it to GRIBANOV

for approval. Though I was only a junior case officer at the

time, I would take the cable, after it had been approved by the

Chief of Section and the Chief of Depart: t, directiy to GRISANOV,

who would simply sign it with no discussion. I do not zerember how

many times I took cables to GRIBANOV nor Go I rememler the contents

of any specific one of them, The first meeting with GRIBANOV that

I specifically remember was in the summer of 1956. I think it was

in Jun I had returned from Kiev with KOZLOV and, after writing

@ Spravka on EURGI, PERFILYEV, KOZLOV, and I went to see GRIBANOV.

‘KOZLOV didn't introduce ne to GRIBANGV at that time, put GRIBANOV

knew that I was NOSENKO because the plan for the BURGI operation

said that I would participate and because PERPILY<V had made an °

appointment for the three of us to speak to GRIBANUV at this tire.

The meeting lasted about 30 or 40 minutes. GRIBANOY read the re-

port on BURGI's recruitment and asked some questions. KOZLOV

answered some of these and I answered others. .Other than asking

what Ukrainians took part in the operation, 1 can recall none of

GRIBANOV's questions nor do I remember any of the conversation

which took place at this meeting. When we were through, KOZLOV

and I left while PERFILYEV remained with GRIBANOV. Perhaps the

first time I was alone with GRIBANOV was in 1958 when I attended

a reception given by the Indian Embassy at the Sovet: Kaya Hotel

in Moscow. Usually [A.V.] SUNTSOV accompanied GRIB. V on such

occasions, but;he was sick at the time. I don't know why SUNTSOV

usually went with GRIBANOV, why I was selected to go, or what I

was supposed to do at the reception. I think GRIBANOV called the H
Seventh Department and asked whom he could use, but I don't know

why he picked me. GRIBANOV told me that, at the reception, I was

to refer to him as Aleksey Mikhaylovich GORBUNOV. I was to

introduce myself as Yuriy Ivanovich and if anybody asked, would use

the last name NIKCLAYEV. Vera ANDREYEVA, who went with us, used + _
the name Vera Ivanova. After work, I went home to change ny $
clothes and we went 1n GRIBANOV's car from the KGB to the Hotel
Sovetskaya. GRIBANOV sat in front with the driver and I sat in
back with Vera ANDREYEVA. I cannot say how many times I have seen
GRIBANOV altogether. From 1959 on 1 saw him more frequently. pt
Sometimes, GRIBANOV would call meetings of chiefs of secticns and

their deputies and I would take part in these. I had begun te

call GRIBANOV by his first name and patronymic in 1958, when I

was Deputy Chief of the First Section of the Seventh Department,

but at these meetings I called him ‘Comrade General.’ .In 1959

I also went to GRIBANOV's office alone in connection with tne

FRIPPEL case and, sometime -between Nay and October 13959, took |

him a report that I had prepared concerning the use of tourist
cover by foreign intelligence organizations.”

23-24 February 1965 (from a protocol signed 26 February):
“GRIBANOV was never in my own office, my home, my parents  hoze.
or my parent's dacha. My father never knew -him. I was. never:
in. GRIBANOV's home or: his: dacha.. ‘I'was never in any KGB cpera~

want to be placed in this position by GRI3ANOV's order against the
wishes of PFD ISEYEV, I went to GRIBANOV and requested that I be
transferied Lack to the Seventh Department, in any position. 1

had already spoken to CHELNCKOV,-who Wa3 then Chief of the Seventh
Department, about this’ matter, and -he had sugg2sted that I go to
GRIBANOV and ask to be returned to the Seventh Departmerit. “GRIBAIIOV
finally agreed that I should return to tne Seventh Department as
Chief of the First Section with the understanding tnat I would be
appointed Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department as scon as this
position would be vacated by [8.A.] BALDIN, In July 1962 I was
appointed Deputy. Chief of the Seventh Department. ‘his uecision
was made by CHELNOKOV and GRIBANOV in accerdance with the intention
stated by GRIBANOV at the end of 1961 that I should be appointed
to this position as scon as possible. I had no further personal
di:cussions with GRIPANOV about this appointment at this time. In
1963 CHELNOKOV [GRIBANOV's Depucy, F.D.] BOBK and GRIBANOV
decided that I should be named First Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Department, ‘they Gid not discuss this with me beforehand and no
order was issued about this appointment. I was simply told that
from that time I would be considered as First uty Chief of the
Department. At this time I was, in fact, the only Deputy Chief of
the Seventh Department, since KOROBOV did not come to the Soventh
Department until about November or December 1963. GRIBANOV did
net tell me his reasons for appointing me Leputy Chief of the

First Section, Pirst Department in January 1960, for wanting to
appoint me Deputy Chief of the First bepartment in late 1961, or
for appointing me Section Chief and later Deputy Chief of the
Seventh Lepartment in 1962. ie did not discuss with me my personal
qualifications for each of these positions. GRIBANOV had nothing
at all to do with my assignment to Geneva in 1962. I think that
the kharakteristika written about me for this trip was signed by
BOBKOV, since he was the Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Direc~
torate who supervised the Seventh Department. TI did not personally
discuss this trip with GRIBANOV before my departure from Moscow.

My candidacy for this assignment was supported by BANNIXOV, the
Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the
work of the Eleventh Department which had the investigative file
on SHAKOV. BANNIKOV was concerned with the question of who would
go as case officer on this trip because SHAKOV, who was suspected
of possibly being a Western agent, was to be in the delegation.
There was no background or neighborhood investigation conducted

on me in connection with my being approved for this trip. My
assignment was approved by the Eleventh Department, by the Person-
nel Office of the Second-Chief Directorate, by the Central Personnel
Office of the KGB and by the Central Committee ofthe CPSU GRIEANOV
had absolutely nothing to do with my assignment to Geneva in 1964.
The kharakteristika on me for this trip was signed by BOBKOV. For
the T5964 trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of
the CPSU was required for me or for any of the other members of
the delegation who had been approved for the 1962 trip. KRLOBU-
STOV, PANCHENKO, and KOVALENKO supported me for the assignment as
@ personal favor to me. I. did not discuss my.1964 trip to Geneva
with GRIBANOV prior to my departure... In fact, I was even afraid
that GRISANOV would find out that I was going and would object to
my making this: second trip.”

23 February 1965+°- NOSENKO commented. further sn-his social. -
nters with GRIBANOV and TAPABRIN. "The following, which was’
not included in the: protocol. quoted above, fs taker from case

officer notes.

encou

Question: Teil me about the occasions when you were with GRIBANOV
and TARABRIN. 7

NOSENKO: Three times--drinking in cafes. Twice afterwards there

were girls. The most recent time was in September or
October 1963. I don't remember the first time.. In
1963 I received a call from TARABRIN at home. ~ Then
GRIBANOV got on the phone and told me to take his car
and come join them at the Praga Restaurant. 1 didn't
take his car because I didn't want te call the duty
officer. 1 teok a cab and went to the Fraga, They
were sitting there and drinking in a private room. I
joined them. They were drinking champagne, but I took

Cognac. TARABRIN suggested girls about 1230 and GRIBANOV

made me go tc the office to get my notebook. I called
one girl I knew--her and her sister. Wren’ I got back
to the restaurant it was closed with only GRIBANOV and

TAPABRIN still there, We went to the girls' (apartment).

They weren't prostitutes exactly. I knew her before.

Question: Is this why GRIBANOV called you to the restaurant (i.e.,

to provide girls)?

NOSENKO: I think so. It was the second time I had participated
in this. This last time CRISANOV told the girl his

name. The girl works in the Archives of the First Cnief

Directorate. At that time of night I wasn't able to
reach anyone else. Her name is Galina Mikhaylovna.
Her mother works in the Central Committee. I don't
remember her last name. GRISANOV was drinking and she

- told him that she had quarreled with ZAYTSEV, the Chief

* of the First Chief Directorate Archives. GRIBANOV
told her that he would give her a job and told me to
arrange for a job in the American Department of the
Second Chief Directorate for her. Galina's flat is in
the building inhabited by Central Committee workers on
Kutuzovskiy Prospekt. GRIBANOV's driver drove him
home at 0600 and he was in the office by 0830.

‘i 3 March 1965: Speaking of the damage his disclosures must
have Caused the KGB, NOSENKO said: “I believe they will punish
people inthe Second Chief Directorate [SCD]... Even GRIBANOV...
He was personally responsible, as head of the SCD, for pushing

_ me ahead.”

NOSENKO: Even firing.

fired?

NOSENKO: Maybe KOVALENKO, BOBKOV, and feople in the Eleventh

Later in the same session the interrogator returned to this. subject:
The following is a transcript of the discussion:

Question: You said you think GRIBANOV migkt be fired. Yet, there
is nothing in the protocol you signed {see above] about
your relations with GRIEANOV which would ceem to make
him personally responsible for you. Is there something
else, something you haven't told me?

NOSENKO: Don't know.

Question: Well, what is your opinion at least?

NOSENKO: Nothing, nothing. Let's not discuss this.

NOSENKO: It's simply my opinion, that's all. I don't know why.

Question: Well, what is your cpinior? : 4

NOSENKO: He was responsible for my becoming Deputy Chief of

Question: But you had already gotten ahead before: you said he
: didn't help you become Deputy Chief of Section in 1958.

NOSENKO: Yes.
Question: Did you ever hear any gossip about his help to you?

NOSENKO: It was said in the SCD that he helped me become Chief
of Section and Deputy Chief of Department.

Question: How about the First Chief Lirectorate and the Seventh
Directorate?

NCOSENKO: No. I wasn't close to them, except GUX.

Question: How about First Chief Directorate residencies abroad?

NOSENK' {S.I.] GAVRICHEV might be-recalled from Geneva.

Question: + You must be withholding something about your relation-
ship with GRIBANOV.

NOSENKO: No, I was telling you I visited his cffice. He told
me: ‘I found out you're drinking too much.’ I said
no, not especially. He said: ‘Stop this drinking
with KOVSHUK. It's not good for you."

Question; But this couldn't harm GRIBANOV's resition now. 4

NOSENKO: They would review my file, and find that it contained
the report about the woman in '54,* the fact that I
was turned down for assignment to Ethiopia, drinking,
scandais--GRIBANOV knew about this, but he approved
my appointment (to Deputy Chief of Department) anyway.

Question: Why did he promote you?

NOSENKO  GRIBANOV thought I was a young, active guy. Six re-
cruitments--oh, they weren't much, but it sounds
great for the First Department, which was having no
success with Americans in the Embassy.

Question: But why make you Deputy Chief of Department?

NOSENKO: He thought I was a tough guy, good case cfficer. In

; ‘59 I saw him often and was involved in a lot of
operations which were reported to him.

e Question: But it was not then, but in 1961, when he made you
Deputy Chief of Department.

who said he was acquainted with NOSENKO, but that their relation-

tacts within the KGB. Subsequent investigation determined, however,
that TAPABRIN anc GRIBANCV were close friends socially end had
attended several parties which NOSENKO had arzanged and attended.
Girls provided by NOSENKO were at these parties.** As a result of
his willful concealment of this information, TARABRIN, like GRIBANOV,
was discharged from the KGB and dismissed from the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union.

erie Smee BANNIKOV was the Acting Chief of the
Second Chief Directorate. NOSENKO, as noted above, said that
BANNIKOV would not be punished as a result of his defection.
NOSENKO also said that it was BANNIKOV who sponsored NOSENKO'S
1964 trip to Geneva and that GRIBANOV had nothing to do with it

This ‘chronology differs fron-that provided by NOSENKO and
described previolsly:. According to NOSENKO, he served in

ment from 1955 until January 1960, in the American Separt-
ment during 1960 and 196:, d@ again in the Tourist Depart-
