NOSENKO 'S KGB CAREER

A Introduction

During his 11 or 12 years' service in the KGB Second Chief

Directorate, NOSENKO said, he rose from case officer to deputy

chief of a department and

from lieutenant to lieutenant colonel

lor, as he has

stated more recently, only to the rank of captain):

An English speaker, he had specialized in operations against

American targets in the USSR as he steadily advanced to higher

positions in the U.5. Embassy Section of the American Department

(from entry on duty

with the KGB in 1952 or 1953 until 1955,

and from January

1960 to January 1962) and in the Tourist Depart-

ment (from June 1955 to January

1960, and from January 1962 until

the defection).

His duties took him to England in 195% and 1958,

Cuba in 1960,

and Bulgaria in 1961 as well as to Switzerland in

1962 and 1964; also, NOSENKO made numerous trips

within the USSR

in connection with

operations, inspections, ard conferences.

Commendations, twice accompanied by bonuses, were awarded to him

by the KGB Chairman in 1956, 1959, and

1961 and by the head of

the Second Chief Directorate in 1957 and 1958; he was one of

70 Second Chief Diroctorate officers awarded the Order of the

'Red Star in 1962: and in the same year he received a madal for

completing ten years of "irreproachable service."*

Thur,

according to NOSENKO, his defection ended a promising career

marked by promotions, responsible positions, extensive travel,

and many honors.

NOSENKO has discussed a large number of KGB operations, in-

cluding some in which he had a personal role, either as a par-

ticipant or as a supervisor, and others conducted by other KGB

personnel in the First and

Second Chief Directorate about which

he learned through his professional and persoral contacts..

Those in which he played a personal role are covered in this

part of the paper.

All are included in Part VI.

The text of

the paper distinguishes the information from collateral sources

and investigations from the details which NOSENKO has provided

on the same topics.

NOSENKO has admitted recently, however, that he never got

any awards at all in the KGB.

Bo. EntEy into the KGB

NOSENKO has provided a wide range of dates for his entry

on duty with the KGB and has offered disparate descriptions of

the circumstances and procedures involved in his becoming a

KGB staff officer.

His statements on these two topics are

presented under separate headings below.

1..

Date of Ertry

A range of dates between early 1952 and 2 April 1953 has

been given by NOSENKO as the time

when he entered on duty with

the KGB, but he has been most consistent in placing his entry

in the month of March 1953,*

in

summary, he has said the

beginning of 1952 (statement of j1 January

1964), May 1952 with

no day (statement of February 1964), 5 or

7 September 1952

(statement of 6 April 1964). March 1953 with no day (statements

of 3 Jure 1962.

24 april 1966 and 27 October 1966),

12 or 15 or

17 March 1953 (statement of 8 April 1964),

13 or 15 March 1953

(statement of 26 July 1965), and 2 April 1953 (statement of

- 17

April 1966).

When

jast questioned about this subject, on

27 October 1966, NOSEUKO acknowledged that he had lied when he

had earlier reported his entry as occurring in 1952.

His state-

ments about the entry date are arranged in chronological order

below.

9 June 1962 (first CIA meeting with NOSENKO) : "In the

beginning of 1953 I came to Moscow Lfrom duty with the GRU in

Primorsk/.

This was 1953, in the beginning.

in January.

Well,

I came on leave to Moscow.

I was staying

at my father's dacha

there...

I was then in the Navy GRU.

So I came to Moscow on

leave

and, while I was home_near Moscow at my father's dacha,

General Bogdan Zakharovich/ KOBULOV* dropped in on us. y said:

versation simply began. He said: "What are you doing?'

'I"m working in GRU.

I worked in the Far East and now I'm work-

ing in the Baltic.

I came here on leave.'

KOBULOV said: 'How

do you like the work?:

I replied:

'Well, speaking horestly, I

don't like the work. ' 'Well," he

said,

with

"You better come to work

US.

Where do you want to go?

Into Intelligence or counter-

intelligence?'..•

I did not want to go into intelligence.

Several of NOSENKO's remarks about his date of entry into

the KGB were made during CIA questioning about how and

when he first learned of the KGB agent "ANDREY"; the lead

to

"ANDREY" was one of the two pieces of information which

NOSENKO offered to sell when he approached CIA in 1962

(see Part II.B.): the "ANDREY case is discussed at

greater length in Part VI.D.3.b.

#* Other sources have reported that KOBULOV was expelled

from the State Security apparatus in 1946 and that he did

not return to a position of authority until a few days

after Lavrentiy BERIYA became MGB-MVD. Minister on 9 or

10 March 1953.

As of 1952, KOBULOV was working in East

Germany for both Wismut A.G., a uranium ore-mining con-

the Soviet contingent to the Allied Control

KOBULOV was arrested at the same time as

BERIYA, along with others in the KGB. See Part V.B.2-

for further references to KOBULOV.

After this, let them go into positive intelligence.

including his claim that he entered on duty with the KGB in

about May 1952.

Confronted with the above inconsistencies,

NOSENKO said that he returred to Moscow in August 1952 and during

the same month had a conversation with KCB persornel about getting

This would place the entry date some time at the beginning

of 1952, for the KGB defector GOLITSYN has reported that

GUK was

transferred from the Second Chief Directorate in

January 1952.

NOSENKO later settled on June or July 1954 as the time of

this transfer:

military attaches in Moscow.

8 April 1964: The interrogator pointed out to NOSENKO that

he had on different occasions dated his entry

into the KGB as

January 1952, March 1953, and in September 1952. The questioning

continued:

about the 15th, about 15 March 1953.

26 July 1965: "At the end of 1952 I came to Moscow from

24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement): "In

SAVITSKIY called me at home and told me to come to see KOBU-

LOV... I worked in the First Section, First LAmerican/ Depart-

ment from the middle of March 1953 until July 1955."

27 October 1966: NOSENKO reaffirmed that he entered the

KGB in mid-March 1953. He said that he had lied when he earlier

said that he had joined the KGB in 1952, and that he knew he was

lying at the times he made these statements.

Asked why he had

lied, he replied: "There was no

sense."

NOSENKO then went on

to explain that because he was only an average student and

because he was a heavy drinker, he had been found unsuitable

Since. April 1966, NOSENKO has said he joined the GRU in

1951, a year later.

by the KGB entry commission when he first applied in 1950.

Therefore, NOSENKO continued, he had been trying to conceal

this fact from CIA by moving events back a year, for he thought

CIA would not have believed him if he reported that he was

first rejected by the KGB and was later accepted.

2. Circumstances and ProcEdures of Entry

Although NOSENKO has consistently associated his entry into

the KGB with his discussions with General KOBULOV, * he has been

inconsistent concerning the content of their conversation, when

it occurred, its relationship ir. time to other events (see

Part IV. 8.),

and where it took place,

at his father's dacha or

at KOBULOV's dacha.

Also, whereas KOSENKO said in 1962 that

there were virtually no administrative formalities prerequisite

to his entry, he recalled in 1964 that he had had conversations

with various KGB personnel officers and (at home) had completed

a KCB questionnaire and a biographic form.

NOSENKO was question

ed at length on these points during 1964 and 1965.

As a restilt,

he provided lengthy descriptions of his various interviews at

KGB Headquarters and of the questionnaire and other documents ne

completed.

In April 1966, however, NOSENKO reverted to his

original statement of 1962: There were no interviews with KGB

personnel officers, and he implied that he had

filled out no

official forms.

His various statements are presented in chrono

logical order below.

9 June 1962:

"KOBULOV was at our dacha.

Well, he is a great

friend of my father.

He was First Deputy to BERIYA, and my

father was Minister of the Shipbuilding Industry•• A conversa-

tion simply began.

He said: 'What are you doing?'

I said: "I'm

working in CRU.

I worked in the far East and now I'm working

on the Baltic.

I came here on leave.'

KOBULOV said: 'How do

you like the work?'

I replied:

*Well, speaking honestly, I

don't like the work.'

'Well, ' he said,

"You better come to work

with us.

Where do you want to go? Into intelligence or counter-

intelligence?'..•

I did not want to go into intelligence. I

consider that only people who have seven, even ten years'

ex-

perience in counterintelligence work should be sent to intelli-

gence.

After this, let them go into positive intelligence.

Then

they know how counterintelligence operates...Well, when KOBULOV

asked me where I wanted to work, I answered:

'It is better, of

course, to go into counterintelligence.'

'Good.

This man - I don't know

He said:

"o.K.

you out and will let you know whether or not we will take you.'

That's all."

NOSENKO was asked whether he completed any forms

or questionnaires.

"No.

me three copies

There were

so many questions.

I

sat down (in KOBULOV's office]. I thought it would be for five

minutes.

I waited there almost two hours.

The assistant came

out a few times and told me that Bogdan Zakharovich is very.

very busy, but that he would give me an escort.

Some senior

He took me and talked to me for a while and then told me to

Either the 12th or the 17th. I don't remember."

15 April 1964:

NOSENKO again described the KGB question-

naire and autobiographic forms he had filled out at home and

recalled that he had also signed a secrecy agreement in the

personnel office.

He also remembered that he had made several

additional phone calls to the KGS personnel office and described

his second visit there to talk to ROZHENKO:

"At the end of

February I was told again to stop in the Pass Office and pick up

a pass and

go to the same floor,

but another room.

They told me

I would have to talk to ROZHENKO today.

He was a Chief of

Section, of the Personnel Section.

So we had a talk.

the same thing again:

'Tell me about yourself.'

he just wanted to look me over. And after that they said: 'All

right, we have not gotten all your documents yet from your

military/ district.

So wait.'"

26 April 1965: NOSENKO recounted his conversation with

KOBULOV, saying that it took piace at KOBULOV's dacha in Usov,

where he and his parents were visiting in January 1953.

NOSENKO

continued:

"I was called at iny family's dacha in February.

They said it was State Security calling and that I was to

report.

I did this on the next day.

Probably I then reported

They said they would call me.

January was leave.

In February and March I was at GRU

Personnel's disposal."

After STALIN'S funeral NCSENKO was

summoned to KOBULOV's office.

His assistant, SAVITSKIY, told

NOSENKO to wait.

After more than an hour had passed, SAVITSKIY

sent him to SHUBNYAKOV's office. There he learred that he would

be assigned to the U.S. Embassy Section and was introduced to

the Chief of the American Department, GORBATENKO.

The official

order appointing NOSENKO was issued the same day, the 13th or

15th of March 1953.

24 April 1966 (signed autobiographical statement: Again

NOSENKO said that he had spoken with KOBULOV at the KOBULOV

dacha and set the date at 1 January 1953.

The document con-

tinued as follows:

"I saw KOBULOV for the second and last time

on the day of STALIN's funeral in my father's office in the

Ministry of Shipbuilding in March 1953. *I had come from the

sanitorium to Moscow and dropped in to see my father at work.

In his office I ran into KOBULOV as they were gathering to go

to the Dom Soyuzov for the funeral.

KOBULOV said he would

concern himself with the question of my entry into the KGB.

The same day I returned to the sanitorium, and several days

later, having completed my treatment. I returned to Moscow.

In the middle of March, KOBULOV's assistant, Colonel SAVITSKIY,

SHUBNYAKOV told me that an

order had been signed appoirting

me a case officer in the First Section of the First Depart-

ment, Second Chief Directorate.

SHUBNYAKOV called the Chief

Then I went to the First Department and was

introduced to the Deputy Chief of

Chief of the First Section, KOZLOV.

KOZLOV said_ I would_ take

over the cases of Senior Case Officer, Captain LAnatolly

TORMOZOV and suggested that I begin work the same day:

I was

accepted for work in the MVD in precisely this way.

It is

necessary to note that none of the workers of the MVD Personnel

ing to statements made on 8 April 196%, he found & desk in Room

I think there were seven files in all, and I

NOSENKO listed these files as those on

Henry SHAPIRO, Eddy GILMORE (as well as one cn GILMORE'S wife

SEREBRYAKOVA and her sister CHERNYSHEVA) , Harrison SALISBURY

During the 1962 meetings with ' CIA, NOSENKO identified

SHAPIRO as an "old agent of ours." He

said that WEITNEY "worked

for us while he was in Moscow and gave us some material, but he

refused to work for us when he left the country and would not

contact us in the United States."

GILLIORE, NOSENKO said, was an

active recruitment target in 1953 and 1954, but NOSENKO did not

know whether he was recruited.

Likewise, he did not know the

status of SALISBURY as of 1953.

NOSENKO stressed that the files he was given to read during

the early period of his KGB service were developmental files

(delo formulyar) rather than the operational files of the agents.

The developmental files were less sensitive, and from them "you

would never be able to figure out whether he (the subject of

the filel is an agent or not."

NOSENKO explained that, once a

person becomes an agent, another file is set up, and these agent

NOSENKO made clear that he was not the case officer responsi

ble for the more important correspondents:

"KOZLOV himself

was working with them, the chief of the section himself-with

SHAPIRO, with SHAPIRO's wife.

I also know that KOZLOV was

working with WHITNEY and with (Andrew J.I STEIGER...

each of these persons there was an operational file which I

did not see.".

According to. NOSENKO, he was in no way involved

with STEIGER. and Edmund STEVENS,

files were held by the chief of the section, KOZLOV. NOSENKO

stated that he read the files on these seven persens "slowly

and made some extracts for myself in my personal l0g--such things

as notations of their dates of arrival, things I could not reme

ber. *

He was also given the files on the agents surrounding

these correspondents, their drivers, maids, and cooks.

b. Agonts Reporting on Correspondents

NOSENKO said he was responsible for handling the agents who

were roporting on SHAPIRO, WHITNEY, SALISBURY

and the GILMORES

and met with

them regularly to learn whether

"anything was new,

who did SHAPIRO meet, what might be interesting in his behavior,

what might be suspicious in his behavior, who he is contacting,

etc."

He then reported to KOZLOV and would sometimes prepare a

written report of his conversationg with

Asked to

describe these meetings, NOSENKO replied:

take the same

case of SHAPIRO. I would meet drivers about three times a monti

or evan two times.

At the meeting I would ask the driver what

was new in SliAPIRC's behavior since our last meeting, whether

SHAPIRO had suspicious contacts with foreigners,

about his neet

ings with Russians,

were they conducted openly or, perhaps, was

SHAPIRO walking behind the person he met.

And then the man

(agent) would begin his report.

Of course, if he spots anything

suspicious he calls immediately,

and I would see him the next

morning.

Otherwise, I would tell him at the meeting that I

would see him again

in about ten days or in two weers, but if

there was something interesting he

should call irmediately.

It was the same with the maid and the cook.

Upon returning to

the office I would have to report to KUZLOV about my meetings,

either orally or in writing.

II, for example, (V.M.) KOVSHU:

lalso of the U.S. Embassy Section) had a meeting with his agents,

he too had to report immediately to KOZLOV or as soon as conveni-

ent to both.

If the meetings were taking place late in

the day

and lasted until midnight or later and there were no written

materials submitted at

the meeting, I could go home and then re-

port the next morning."

KOZLOV accompanied NOSENKO to meetings with the various

agents surrounding the correspondents.

"At first he was teach-

ing me.

Then he would go in cases when something interesting

would begin to develop, even when it hadn't yet begun to develop

but when

there may have been a hint in a case of some other case

officer."

NOSENKO's agent network consisted mainly of domestic and

clerical personnel in contact with the correspondents and their

families.

Asked to describe them, he said on 15 April 1964:

"My first agent was a woman agent, a cook, who was working at

GILMORE's place.

She also worked

Her codename was 'AGLODINA', a funny one.

at the Associated Press later.

My second agent was

a chauffeur whose codename, I think, was

'SERGEY'.

I think he

was driving WHITNEY.

Then I also had SHAPIRO's chauffeur, a

funny little fellow.

In other words,

charwomen, chauffeurs,

this was my agentura lagent network!." Although NOSENKO was

able to give a breakdown of this network in terms of the number

and type of agents targetted against particular individuals, he

had forgotten their true names and could not provide

personality information on any of them. He explained:

remember now.

agents to other case officers in the U.S. Embassy Section with

the exception of "RAKETA" and "VOLODINK,

been suspected as such on the basis of his long stay in Moscow,

his unusually good access to Soviet information sources, and his

agent by a cryptonym (known to NOSENKO and confirmed by COLIT

appearing in the CHEREPANOV papers."

The KGB defector Nikolay KHOKLOV had earlier identified the

Polish-born wife of WHITNEY as a KGB agent, an allegation which

she denied, and it had been long assumed that waltitY too had

reached some sort of accormodation with the KGB because of this

fact and because of the long duration of his tour as a correspond-

ent in MoscoN.

GILMORE also had

been suspected by CIA before NOSENKO's in-

formation was received.

He servea in Moscow for: 12 years, from

1941 to 1953, and 15 married to a Soviet national.

SALISBURY served two short tours, of about one year each,

in Moscow during the 1950's.

second of these, he

became enamored with the Pole who was to become WHITNEY's wife

(see above)

and was during this period a subject of criticism by

other American correspondents in Moscow for his pro-Soviet arti-

cles.

When WHITNEY married the Pole shortly after STALIN'S

death, SALISBURY returned

to the United States and his articles

took on an anti-Soviet tone.

NOSENKO claimed no involvement with the other two American

correspondents whom he identified

as KGB agents,

STEVANS and

STEIGER, both the subjects of a considerable amount of derogatory

information in CIA files.

They are discussed in Part VI.D.2.

under the heading of NOSENKO's American leads.

3. Operations Against Military Attache Personnel

Some time in the first half of 1954 NOSENKO was. relieved of

his responsibilities for the correspondent cases, and from then

until his transfer from the American Department he hanäled KGB

Second Chief Directorate operations against the officer person-

nel of the U.S. Military Attache's office.

NOSENKO's account of

the turnover of the correspondent files to his successor and of

the acceptance of the attache files is presented below.

- 8 April 1964: "I took over the Military Attache cases

from Nikolay KHRENOV..•

When I was leaving

in 1955, I turned

the attache files over to Valeriy BUDYLDIN."

- 10 April 1964:

"I made a mistake...

wOrk.

This is not right.

a. Agents Reporting on Military. Attaches

Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network

(agentura) at his disposal in operations against U.S. Mili-

tary Attaches during this period which began in 1954, NO-

SENKO replied:

"There were two maids,

a cook, drivers*...

about ten persons, plus the agent 'SERVIZNIY'

and the one

with the code name

' DMITRIYEV'

... These additional two

agents, about 12 or 13 agents altogether."

With one ex-

ception, this network remained constant until NOSENKO trans-

ferred from the U.S. Embassy Section in mid-1955.

He met

each agent about once a week, except for the chauffeurs who

were met three times a month in a safehouse or on the

street.

According to NOSENKO, this network was

"just a

supporting agentura, which very seldom was worthwhile,

the

main source of information on

the Military Attaches being the

microphones in their offices.**

Newly added to the network while NOSINKO held this

position was a maid inserted to report on Army

L. MICKELSON and his successor, Fillmore K. MEARNS.

name, NOSENKO thought, was NOVIKOVA.

She was an English-

speaking university graduate but "hid her knowleage of

English in order to overhear

conversations or read letters

without taking them outside."

Besides NOVIKOVA, NOSENKO named one other maid who was

his agent, Mariya NEVEROVA, code name "SHIVEDOVA,"

and she

RICHARDS.

He described NEVEROVA as a

oman," from whom he never obtained anything of interest.

They met in a safehouse on Kuznetskly Most.

Of the KGB agents among

the chauffeurs, NOSENKO identi-

fied Nikolay SANYRYEV, who was used by various of the at-

taches.

"He reported where they went, what they

whether they took notes of photographs, whether they had

unusual packages with them, and so on."

When viewing photographs in September 1964, HOSELKO

icentified Vladislav VOROBYEV as the agent

"SERVIZNIY. " He

had been working in the Embassy since its

starting first as a messenger boy and, in NOSENKO's time,

performing clerical tasks.

tion with the Military Attaches, and NOSENKO said he himself

did not know why he had been given VOROBYEV to handle in

1954.

The main function of this agent was delivering to

NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephore listings of the

Embassy, issued monthly.

"DMITRIYEV'g" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV:

NOSENKO saw this name

on a 1962 phone list and thought, but

was not sure, that this was his agent.

An electrician who

worked on the Embassy's electrical wiring systems and eleva-

tor, "DMITRIYEV" reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires and

The Military Attaches used a pool of five drivers at random,

NOSENKO said. Apart from the permanent driver for the senior

attache, none were targetted against individual members of the

attache

office.

other wires he had observed in the Embassy as well as on the

security measures on the top floors.

Like VOROBYEV, "DUITRI-

YEV" had no direct connection with the Military Attaches.

In September 1964 NOSENKO was shown a series of 260 bio-

graphic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American En

bassy in Moscow.

the photographs; NO

SENKO

did not identify the photographs of SHYYRYEY and KUKOLEV

but said that the face of VOROBYEV was familiar, adding that

he thought his name was VOROBYEV.

When shown the biographic

information on SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV, he identified each of them

as his agents during the 1954-1955 period in the American De-

partment and equated them to the cryptonyms given previously.

In the case of SHNYRYEV, when shown the bicgraphic information,

which listed SHNYRYEV as "chauffeur for the lilitary Attache,"

NOSENKO exclaimed:

"Oh my God,

this is my own agent."

He

later said it was a good photograph of SiNYRYE.

b. NOSENKO's Targets

As the Second Chief Directorate case officer responsible

for

operations against American Military (Arry) Attaches sta-

tioned in Moscow, his main task was not to recruit them but

rather was to prevent the attaches from collecting intelligence.

He has used this statement about his main task (identical with

that of other U.S. Embassy Section officers working against

the Army and Navy Attaches) to support his claim that no U.S.

Armed Forces Attaches were recruited by the KGB from 1953 un-

t11 his defection in 196•

He has also said that this is one

reason he knows relatively little about the personal back-

grounds of his various targets during this period--the empha-

sis was on surveillance instead of development for recruitment-

purposes.

Asked in February 1965 to list the Army Attache per

sonnel

for whom he was directly responsible during 1954 and

1955, NOSENKO gave the following names:

"MICKELSON, MEARNS,

RICHARDS, FELCHLIN, BENSON, SULE, STROUD, and CARDELLA, "**

His

knowledge of the activities of these targets and of KGB action

against them, coupled with information from other sources, is

discussed in the following paragraphs.

Naval Attaches were handled by ZHUKOV during this period, NO-

SENKO

said, while Air Attaches were initially handled by CHURA-

NOV.

When CHUR-NOV left the section

in early 1954, he turned

over the Air Attache files to PANKRATOV, who turned them over

later in the year to KHRENOV.

**This is the order given by NOSENKO.

The list comprises two

generations of Army Attaches in Moscow and is neither in al

phabetical order nor in terms of date of service in Moscow.

It 1s, however, in descending order of rant fron Colonel NICKEL-

SON through Captain MULE to Chief Warrant Officer CARDELLA.

Questioned about these officers in a different context,

NOSENKO

indicated knowledge of their ranks.

Not mentioned by NOSEnKO

was George VAN LAETHEN, Assistant

Army Attache in Moscow from

August 1951 to August 1953 (prior to the time when NOSENKO said

he was responsible for work against the military attache office).

VAN LAETHEM returned to Moscow in 1955, however, and was at=

tached to the Army Attache staff again from 19 March to 19 May

1955, during which tine NOSENKO claimed he was still responsible

for this group.

(1) MICKELSON

NOSENKO has identified Earl L. MICKALSON as a colonel

the Military Attache in Moscow during 1954 and 1955.

PANKRATOV was the case officer originally handling MICKEL

SON, and the case was turned over to NOSENKO in 1954.

When asked about agents who might have been working against.

said that there was one cook, a KGB

operational contact whose name he did not recall, and

whose name NOSENKO believed was NOVIKOVA;

the cook and NOVIKOVA went to work for MICKELSON after NO

SENKO had left the U.S. Embassy Section:

In addition to

these two, the only other

source reporting

on WICKELSON was

his chauffeur, whose name. NOSENKO also did not renember.

NOSENKO suid that the KGB learned nothing interesting about

MICKELSON from concealed microphones, telephone taps, or

surveillance, and that no operational approach or recruit-

ment was

attempted.

There was,

in tact, no interesting or

derogatory information on MICKELSON from any source.

According to information in CIA files, MICKELSON was

involved in at least two incidents inside the Soviet Union

In May 1954 he was arrested

in Tbilisi on the

chares of having photographed a

bridge, but he persuaded the Militia not to press charges.

In August 1951 MICKLISON was arrested again for illegal

photographs souti of KHARKOV: on this occasion he was held

for two hours before being released.

United States,

RICHARDS.

The one agent reporting on

RICHARDS whom NOSENKO

could nanie

was the maid Mariya NEVEROVA, KGB cryptonym

"SHEDOVA," but she had never provided any worthwhile in-

formation

about RICHARDS.

In addilion,

some soviet drivers

reported on RICHARDS, but nothing useful was obtained from

then.

According to ClA records, RICHARDS served in Moscow

from July

1954 to july 4956.

There

was

the

office which he shared first with MICKELSON and later with

MEARNS.

RICHARDS confirmed that Mariya NEVEROVA was his

maid and described her as a "mousy" woman who had a heart

attack during the period she was

employed by him.

(This

incident was not recalled by NOSENKO:)

For about four

months of his Moscow tour,

RICHARDS

took Russian-language

lessons from Ludmila GROMAKOVA in his apartment.

During

these lessons,

RICHARDS often uiscussed

labor conditions and

wages in the United States and, on one occasion, had her

record her speech on his tape recorder.

GROMAKOVP. was preg

nant and unmarried at the tine.

(NOSENKO has named GROMAKOVA

as a KGB agent in another context but has not mentioned her

contacts with RICHARDS.) * RICHARDS identified one "Volodya"

11.e..

first nane Vladimir) as his principal driver.

About

62

years old in 1354, Volodya was the son of a rich

jeweler

in Moscow during the

Revolution.

Volodya himself was well

educated and, on one occasion while picnicking outside Mos-

cow,

he spoke intelligently with RICHARDS

about the

Revolu-

tion, propaganda, and

news media.

(NOSENKO did not know of

Volodja.)

Further details from RICHARDS are given in the

following. section on FELCHLIN.

(iv) FELCHLIN

NOSENKO identified lloward L. FELCHLIN as a lieutenant

colonel who served

as Assistant Army Attache in Moscow and

stated that he was FELCHLIN's case officer.

FELCHLIN was in

the Soviet Union during 1954 and part of 1955, until being

declared persona non grata.

NOSENKO did not recall the

name: of any agents specifically targetted against FELCHLIN,

although he thought FEICHLIN must have had a maid and she

would

have been

a KGB agent.

Additionally, NOSENKO said,

the Assistant Military Attaches shared a pool of cars and

drivers, and these were his agents.

Unable to recall the

precise date of FELCHLIN's expulsion, NOSENKO related it to

some event regarding Soviets stationed in the United States

for which the Soviet Government decided to reply in kind.

NOSENKO was imprecise as to the pretext used to expel FELCH

LIN,

but said the action was based on information which had

been accumulated from a number of sources

and incidents.

For example, FELCHI.IN had been caught

taking

some photographs

and a report had been written; along with other similar

indications of FELCHLIN's activities and reports of agents

in contact with FELCHLIN, the report

was filed away for pos-

sible

future use.

NOSENKO was questioned further on FELCH-

LIN during

the February 1965 interrogations.

He said then

that FELCHLIN alone had been declared persona non

grata,

and that no other attaches had been involved.

SHNYRYEV was not well, suffered

fron var wounds, and had

continuing chest or lung trouble.

had any medical problem, NOSENKO

said he was not avare of

any.)

SENIO did not recognize FEDOROVA's name and did not recall

(v) BENSON

NOSENKO identified his target John S. BENSON as a

major and Assistant Army Attache in Moscow.

He did not

recall the names of any agents working against BENSON but

said that BENSON

was with MULE and SIROUD (see below) in

Stalingrad in 1955 unen

the KGB

with electronic "spying" devices.

They were declared per-

sona non grata.

The kgb had no other derogatory information

on BENSON from any other source.

(vi) STROUD

NOSENKO identified William R. STROUD as a captain and an

Assistant. Army Attache.

The only agents working against him

were

the Military Attaches' drivers.

From concealed micro-

phones, the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned before

STROUD's arrival in Moscow that he was

an expert in the use of

electronic spying apparatus.

Ile was with BENSON and MULE

in Stalingrad and was declared persona non grata along with

them (see below). Other than this, NOSENKO said, the KGB

knew nothing unusual or interesting about STROUD from any

source.

CIA files show that STROUD was, with BENSON and MULE,

the victim of the Soviets'

seizure of technical eguipment

in Stalingrad and was declared persona non grata on 7 May

On 31 January 1955 he travelled to kharkov from Mos-

with First Secretary Frank SISCOE to interview an

defector living there.

declarco persona. non grata.

NOSENKO gave the following

account of this incident:

For some time the

Second Chief

Directorate had boon trying to acquire a small, convenient

piece of electronic equipment which American Intelligence

officers were known to be using during their travels inside

the Soviet Unton.

As early as the beginning of 1954, the

American Department hnd been given authortzation fron the

Central Coarittco of the Communist Party to sterl this

equipment fron the Americans, provided that the success of

such an operation was assured.

Before his transfer to the

Tourist Department

in 1955, NUSENKO himself had helped to

develop plans for the operation and had even arranged an

abortive ettcapt lo stcal the equipment from

an attache at

a railroad station outside doscow.

vihile BENSON, MULE,

and STROUD were on one of their trips (after NOSENKO's

tran3-

fer) it was learnud that they had the equipment with them,

and the KCB decided to take it from them in Stalingrad.

To carry out the operation, Lieutenant General P.V. FEDOTOV,

then Chief of the KGB Second Chie? Directorate, and A.M.

GORBATENKO, Chier of the Auerican Departnent, flew with

other personnel from the American Department to Stalingrad.

The hotel rooms

of BENSOY,

STROUD and MULE were watched

constantly from a visual observation post, and it. was noted

that they never ato in the hotel restaurant but always in

their rooms.

It was also noted that the apparatus was

placed under a pillow before they began to cat.

Khile

they

were seated at the table having dinner, therefore, the KGB

officers suddenly entered the roon and

seized the eguipment.

In order to partially cover the illegality of this

act,

was decired to make a show of expelling BENSON, MULE and

STROUD from the Soviet Union, and this was done via the

persona non grata action.

According to infornation from other sources,

the equip

ment was seized from BENSON, MULE, and STROUD on

5 May 1955,

and the three were declared persona non grata on 7 May (a

month before NOSENKO ciained to have transferred to the

Tourist Department).*

When the 7 May date

was given to

NOSENKO during the February 1965 interrogations, he replied

that the operation was handled at a higher level, that he

did not directly particinate in it, but that he had been

Involved in the earlier planning to seize the equipment.

It was pointed out to him that he had always sald he was in

the fourist Department at the time of this operation, and

that he had consistently said that he transferred

from the

American to the Tourist Department in June 1955.

NOSENKO

shrugged, but offered no comment.

*The

who served in the United

States

from 1958 to 1963, reported to CIA

in. 1964 that while working as a KGB informant in Kirov in

the early 1950's, he was targetted against three U.S. Hill-

tary. Attaches travelling on a train.

he might have contributed information leading to the three

mericans (as he later read in the Soviet press) being de=

clared persona non grata.

(1K) CARDELLA

NOSENKO said that in 1954 and 1955 there was an admini-

strative officer in the Embassy by the name of James CARDELLA.

The KGB had no interesting

or unusual information concerning

CARDELLA from any source, and NOSENKO could say nothing more

about his.

CIA files show that Chief Karrant Officer CARDELLA served

in Moscos from September 1953 until June 1955.

Other than the

fact that a microphone was discovered in CARDELLA'S Moscow Em-

bassy office in 1964, 110

concerning him is available.

NOSENKO identified George VAN LASTHEM as an Assistant Air.

tempted in 1953 or 1954.

tie sald that during this period a

Russian actress, Alla LARIONOVA, was placed on a train going

from Berlin to Moscow with the mission of striking up an acquain-

tance with VAN LAETHEM whish could be followed up in Moscow.

She succeeded in meeting him

and gave him her aidress and tele-

phone: number.

Although she was certain that

she would hear frcm

him, he never did call he: in Moscow.

NOSINKO said that he had

heard

about this fron P.F. PANKRATOY, the case officer handling

LARIONOVA.

He added that

CHURANOV was the case officer respon-

sible

for VAN LAETHEM,

as he was for all members of the Air

At-

tache's office at that tine.

NOSENKO knew of no other interest

or activity concerning

VAN LAETHEM.

CIA records show that VAN LALTIEY was not an Assistant Air

Attache but an Assistant Army Attache, serving in Moscow from

March 1951 to March 1953.*

As cryptographic security officer

and officer in charge of

the Embassy code room, he had super-

visory responsibility for the military code clerks and mechanics,

Including Dayle SMITIl, and he was on fairly close personal terms

with Sergeant Roy RHODES until the latter's departure from Mos-

cow in January 1953; VAN LAETHEM's duties also carried respon

sibility for sensitive electronic activities in the Embassy.**

He was again in Moscow from

19 March to 19 May 1955 (at a time

when NOSENKO claims to have been the KGB case officer for U.S.

Army Attaches). Although this trip was always intended to be

only a TDY, it

was represented to the Soviets as a PCS Assistant

Army Attache assignment because of the extrerely sensitive na-

ture of his business there.

He was project officer for the en-

tire electronics program at the Embassy, and went to Moscow to.

review the operations including the planned use of the new

electronic equipment which was seized from BENSON, MULE, and

STROUD in Stalingrad in May 1955 (see above) •

Although VAN LAETHEM completed his two-year: tour in Moscow in

March 1953, just at the time NOSENKO said he entered the KGB,

he was succeeded in his post by Walter MULE, for whom NOSENKO

has claimed full responsibility. Thus, the fact of his posi

tion as Assistant: Army Attache and MULE's predecessor would

presumably be

available to NOSENKO.

Each time NOSENKO gave CIA the story of the recruitment of

"ANDREY" in the June 1962 meetings,

he related it to Roy RHODES:

Each reference to Roy RHODES was followed by a statement that

it was through RHODES that the KGB learned of the existence of

special electronic equipment in the U.S. Embassy.

Do June 1955 to January 1960 (Tourist Department)

1. Introduction

By his account NOSENKO served in the American-Canadian-

British Section of

the Tourist Department, * KGB Second Chief

Directorate, fron June 1955 (shortly after the department

was created to operate with and agaiast foreign travellers

in the USSR) until his transfer to another department in

that directorate in January 1960.

He was a case officer

until appointed Deputy Chief of the Section about June 1958.

In staterents made prior to April 1966, NOSENKO claimes to

have been twice promoted during this four and one-half year

period-to captain in July 1956 and to major in August or

September 1959--but in a signed statement of April 19€6 be

said he remained a captain from 1956 until his defection.

NOSENKO has described his personal and direct partici

pation in the section's activities as consisting of:.

-Recruitment of two Soviet nationals as homosexual

agents, ** with NOSENKO

their handler from the outset until

they were dropped in 1962 or 1963.

-Recruitment and handling of Soviets as agents tar-

getted against American tourists; their number varied from

eight to 14 and many were employed by Inturist.

-Operations involving :4 foreigners who visited the

USSR for various lengths of time.

-Recruitment and handling of the American Express Co

pany representative in Moscow,

whom YOSENKO continued to

meet following his reassignment in January 1960.

-Decision in October 1959 that Lee Harvey OSWALD was

of no operational interest to the KGB,

and subsequent par-

cIcipation in the KGB investication of

OSWAlD's activities

in the USSR.

Each of these categories is discussed separately below.

2. Soviet Homosexual Agents.

Because he had been

seen meeting a foreigner in a

public lavatory in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded

that A.I. VOLKOV might be a homosexual and hence of some

operational value.

The KGB therefore mounted an operation

which verified this possibility in 1987: A homosexual agent

of the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department provoked

VOLKOV into a compromising situation. Then VOLKOV, who bad

previously been a KGB agent but was at this time deactivated,

was called to KGB Headquarters where, after NOSENKO interro-

rated him, he admitted his homosexuality and agreed to

#These components are also known as the First Section and

Seventh Department, respectively.

## Page 26

NOSENKO's proposal

to work for the KGB among homosexuals.

VOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year to recruit a hono

sexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronynic not recalled)

YEFRENOV.

The two agents subsequently worked as a team

against foreigners under NOSENKO's dirertion; in addition

to specific targets, they had the general assignment of

associating with foreign visitors in Ho:cow for the pur

pose of spotting possible homosexuals.

NOSENKO described

on 12 June 1962 his use of these agent a:

Then, as Chief, I recommend that he be recruited or not-

If he can give something, I say:

'Well, let's have

this, I speak to these boys:

When

NOSENKO moved from the Tourist Department to the

Second Chief Directorate's Anerican Department in January

1960,

he took VOLKOV and YEFRENOV with him.

They were

never used against targets in the U.S. Embassy, but, NOSE'KO:

said, the Tourist Department "used to call me on homosexual

prospects."

VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued as active KGB

agents until some time in 1960 or 1961, after which they

could not be used further since they had become too well

known, and NOSENKO finally retired their files to KGB

archives in 196z or 1963..

The last operation in which these

two agents participated was during January 1962.

During interrogation on these agents, NOSENKO has beeD

unable to tell where they lived in Moscow,

situation, or other such details. He said that he never

met either in a safehouse (always

on the street) and never

net either of them alone, without the other being present..

## Page 27

109.

NOSENKO has described eleven KGB

approaches to Anericans

based on

compromising evidence obtained with the assistance

of VOLKOV and/or YEFRENOV and several other cases in which

Americans were suspected of being homosexuals on the basis

of the evaluation of these two.

Additionally,L

at least six Americans, not reported on by

NOSENKO, have

had contacts with one or both of these arents

in Moscow.

With one or possibly two exceptions, all

the contacts of VOLKOV and YEFREYOV reported by NOSENKO. Or

other sources took place during the period from April to

slovember 1959.

The known exception was the KGB approach to

W.E. JOHNSON in January 1962;* the possible exception was

the contact with the American psychiatrist, which took place

in 1959 or early 1960 but cannot be dated precisely.

Finally,

NOSENKO has described the contacts between VOLKOV; YEFREMOV,

and the American Robert BARRETT in the summer of 1959 but

does not know of their contacts in the summer of 1961,

shortly before BARRETT was approached on the basis of con

promising information obtained in 1959.***

3.

Other Soviet Agents

The Tourist Department, Just established when NOSENKO

was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent network for

operations against American and British tourists.

Conse-

quently, NOSENKO said,

he

and

the other case officers had

to "start from the beginning."

As a first step, NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow

officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist; these

were not agents, he explained, but "just persons known to

the KGB so that a KGB man could approach

one of them with

questions about somebody or something."

NOSENKO began

to

collect information on these individuals and others with the

alm of formalizing their recruitment; by the end of 1955,

he estimated, he had a network of about eight agents, all

of then Inturist interpreters.

During the following

four

years,

the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied:

Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another,

some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of changing

all the time, back and forth."

In 1956, NOSENKO said, he had

about ten agents, in 1957 there were about 12, in 1958 about

eight, and at the end of 1959 (when he was preparing to return

to the American Department) he had approximately 12 to 14.

NOSENKO has provided information on five of these agents,

all of whom he sayg he recruited from within Inturist during

1955. These were:

An Inturist interpreter and one of

the first Inturist agents recruited by. NOSENKO. " SOBOROVA

was NOSENKO's agent until 1959 (when she married and retired)

and reported to him on all foreigners with whom she worked as

Commonwealth Department in 1957 or the beginning of 1958.

In 1957 or 1959 she was involved in a sexual compromise

operation against an American professor, which did not

reach the point of a recruitment approach.

Between 1957

or 1958 and 1900 she was working against an American tourist

naned Philip NIELSEN who was suspected of connection with

CIA and who was under study for recruitment by the

KGB. #

KUNGAROVA later married NIELSEN and the two lived in :,

England.

The KGB was still interested in NIELSES at the

time NOSENKO left the Tourist Department, but YOSENKO be

lieved there was no recruitment. Urs. NIELSEN died in 1965.

Besides those in Inturist, NOSENKO has named several

other agents whom he recrufted

or was given while in the

Tourist Department.

These included the following:

-Aleksey A. DMITRIYEV: KGB cryptonym "TOMO," & can-

didate member of the Academy of Sciences USSR and a special

ist on Japan and Thailand.

DMITRIYEV speaks Japanese and

English and worked at the Japanese exhibition in Moscow.

NOSENKO did not indicate how. DMITRIYEV was used operationally

or how he was connected with the American-Canadian-British

target..

- (Inu) IVANOV: A lawyer employed by the Institute of

Foreign Trade in Moscow.

NOSENKO did not personally re-

cruit this agent.

IVANOV moved to Moscow

from the Baltic

area and his provious handlers there notified the Center,

suggesting that the agent might be of use in the capital.

NOSENKO contacted IVANOV and later turned him over to the

British Commonwealth Department of the Second Chief Direc-

torate which,

NOSENKO believed,

"planted him in the British

Trade Mission or sonething like that."

-Marina RYTOVA:

KGB cryptonym "KRYMOVA," born about

1923 or 1924 and educated at the Military Institute of

Foreign Languages, a special school which also had Communist

students from

foreign countries.

There she studied military

subjects as well as foreign larguages.

She speaks English

and Greek well.

NOSENKO could

not recall who recruited her,

but she was turned over to him by i.A.

KONSTANTINOV, &

Tourist Department case officer, in 1956 or 1957.

At that

time she was working as an interpreter at the Russian

Permanent Exhibit in Moscow and continued in this job until

about 1960, when she became an instructor in the Greek

language school of the Institute of International Relations.:

She reported to NOSENKO any information which she obtained

on foreign delegates or foreign tourists who visited the

Exhibit in Moscow.

As she was often invited by the Ministry

of Agriculture to

interpret during meetings between Soviet

officials and delegates from America, England,, and Greece,

she also reported this information to NOSENKO.

RYTOVA

served several times as an interpreter for KHRUSHCHEV and:

once participated in a conversation he had with' Iowa farmer

GARST.

In 1959 or 1960 she was sent as interpreter with a

small delegation which visited GARST's farm in the United

States and was used by the KGB Legal Residency in Washington,

from about 1955 to 1957 and was then turned over to NOSENKO.

She reported on JELISAVCIC, who was not approached, according

to NOSENKO.

4 Operations with Foreign Visitors

NOSENKO said he participated in 14 operations with

foreign visitors to the USSR while a member of the American

Canadian Section of the Tourist Department.

Nine of these

operations resulted in recruitments

(excluding one who later

was recruited by

another element of the KGB, but including

another whom NOSENKO classified as a borderline case). Of

the remaining five operations which did not end with a re-

cruitment, no approach was contemplated by the KGB in one

case, one

target rejected NOSENKO's proposal, the KGB was

unable to obtain compromising material

for an approach to a

third,

and for political reasons the KGB decided against

approaching the final two.

Although the information from NOSENKO on the timing of

these operations does not always agree with that from other

sources, these cases can

be grouped chronologically as

follows:

1955 - one; 1956 - one; 1957 - three; 1958 - two;

and 1959 - seven.

The operations in 1955, 1956 and, with

one exception, 1959 were homosexual provocations.

The re-

cruitment of Arsene FRIPPEL in 1959 was basco on heterosexual

compromise.

These fourteen operations

are summarized briefly below

In the approximate order in which the cases began.

each case, NOSENKO's information is followed by

a summary of

the results of CIA investigations.

The description of the

case is more detailed than the others, for reasons in-

dicated in the text.

a Attempted Entrapment of MALIA (1955)

NOSENKO'S Information: Martin MALIA, a graduate student, :

spent about four months in the USSR in 1955 and was sus

pected of having connections with American Intelligence.

Toward the end of his stay, while under surveillance, MALIA

was observed in contact with a Soviet citizen believed to

NOSENKO eventually obtained a confession that he had had

homosexual relations, with MALIA.

for the Soviet to introduce MALIA to a KGB homosexual agent,

the latter enticed MALIA to a specially equipped hotel room

In Moscow; NOSENKO was on the scene (but not directly in

touch with MALIA) when the introductions were made in a

and from an observation point in a

nelekboring hotel room he watched the KGB agent and MALIA

having rclations. With MALIA irsisting on the lights being

turned off, however, it was impossible to obtain compro-

mising photographs

(tho KGB did not set have infra-red

photographic equipmont, NOSENKO said) and therefore no re

crultrent approach

was nade to MALIA.

During this and a

inter trip to Moscow in 1961, MALIA was "very cautioug,"

and the KGB never again succeeded in exploiting MALIA'g

honosexuality.for a recruitment approach.

Investigation Results: MALIA, a U.S. Javy intolligence

officer during world war l1, has visited

the Soviet Union

in 1955 and twice in 1962.

Thile buying books for the

Library of Congress and several universities in 1955, MALIA

travelled over 10,000 miles throughout the USSR, which was

sufilciently unusual at the time to attract press publicity.

In 1955 and 1962 he had contacts with dissident soviet

citizens and clandestinely brought to the lest Ilterature

for fublishing abrord.

In December 1963 MALIA was the

subject of an attack in the Soviet press which charged that

b. Recruitment of BURGI (1956)

NOSENKO's Information:

At the first meeting in 1962

and despite his stated fear for his own security and his

determination to discuss only the tro leads hu wished to sell

CIA,

NOSENKO described his recruitment of Yale Professor

Richard BURGI on the basis of a homosexual provocation oper

ation which began in Moscow and culnirated with an approach

in Kiev in June 1956.

NOSENKO reported that he received a

letter

of commendation (blagodarnost') and & honus of one

month's pay for this recrultment, but in 1966 he retracted

this clain.

The BURGI case was

the first operation

in which

NOSENKO had direct contact with a foreign target of the KGB,

and NOSENKO said

he counted it

as a turning point in his

personal and professional life:

It was with this success-

ful operation, NOSENKO stated, that he "began to grow" from

a spoiled playboy into a responsible and effective counter:

intelligence officer.

The BURGI operation was the first

recrultment carried out by the Tourist Department after 1t

was created in 1955, according to NOSENKO.

In 1964 NOSENKO

reported for the first time that his superior, A.S. KOZLOV,

Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department, had also taken part

In this operation, but that he, NOSENKO, was the responsible.

case officer.

In

August 1965;

when asked who had recruited

BURGI, NOSENKO replied:

"KOZLOV and NOSENKO."

Asked who

recruited him first, NOSENKO said:

"KOZLOY, naturally.

He

was the Deputy Chief of the Department. The collection of

the materials [in preparation

for the approach, was in the

hands of Case Officer NOSENKO."

Because of the personal and

general significance ascribed to this operation by NOSENKO,

1t la discussed in detati bere:

In

August 1965 NOSENKO reported that at the time of

BURGI'S

arrival in the USSR, his

file

contained a copy of

his visa application

(anketa), "maybe" an excerpt from a

cable sent by the Soviet Embassy in the United States saying

that a visa had been granted, a routine note from Inturist

giving BURGI's anticipated

inside the Soviet Union, and

general KGB Archives and of the First Chief Directorate

Archives.

NOSENKO hinself ran the traces, which proved to

be negative; there was no information on record concerning

SURGI, and since no other names were mentioned in the

naterial

available on BURGI, no other traccs were made.

The

KGB interest in BURGI derived exclusively from the fact that

he was a professor of Slavic studies

and therefore had con-

tact with students who might sone day work for

the u.s.

State Department,

American Intelligence,

and

organizations.

other target

NOSENKO did not recall who first suggested

an altcmpt to recruit nin.

then BURGI arrived in the Soviet Union,

he came in

contact with a number of KGB agents,

and their reports were

placed in the unofficial file maintained by NOSENKO.*

SENKO could not recall in 1965 how nany such agents

nay

have been, their names,

or what they might have reported

concerning BURGI.

(BURGI had

en Inturist interproter but

NOSENKO did not know whether he was a XGB agent.)

From some

source, name forgotten by NOSINKO, the KGB obtained indica~

that BURGI

was a homosexual, and it was decided to

try to obtain the grounds

for recruitment by homosexual com-

NOSENKO therefore

approached xu.A. LOPUKHOV,

an

of the Britis' Department who handled the homosexual

agent Viktor BELAYOVSKIY, and asked permission to use his

agent in setting up the compromise.

After permission had

been received to mount an operation on this

basis, LOPUKHOV

interest in using BURGI in the United States.

cover.

NOSEYKO

was unable to recall how the car was ac-

quired, whether it was a KGB or Incurist vehicle, who the

driver

was, whether he was in the employ of the local KGB,

or other details.

In accordance with the operational plan, the local KGB

officer told BURGI encoute to the city that all the hotels

in Kiev were full at the moment because of various confer-

ences, but that Inturist had

arranged for him to stay for

about

a day in a private apartment in the center

of town;

he would be moved to a hotel as soon as possible.

in Kiev, NOSENKO,

KOZLOV, V.S. PETRENKO, a local KGB officer,

and (fnu) KASTYKAITE

a woman

housekcoper,

were waiting for

them.

NOSEYKO

could

not remember how

or whether he intro-

duced himself to BURGI.

The recruitment conversation,

he

said, was handled by

"KOZLOV-NOSENKO," but NOSENKO had for-

gotten by 1965 who said what:

"I don't romember what I

talked about and I don't remember what KoZLOV talled about.

Many things were discussed.

It started with how he liked

his stay

inithe Soviet Union...

Then we slowly proceeded

to say how unfortunate

it was that information had been re-

ceived

about his conduct

in Moscow.

We told hin that his

homosexual activities were known,

that this was punishable

under Soviet law according to article. so-and-so of the

crininal code, etc., that he was not a diplonat, had no

diplomatic immunity, that he could be taken to court ac-

cording to the

Soviet law...

Nell, he was scared, confused,

upset, and

felt uncomfortable.

Then we slowly proceeded to

say that all that could be smoothed out, but, you understand,

the basis was prepared for the man to say:

'All right, I

agree to help.'

We showed him the pictures. He was

embarrassed

of course-he was naked.

Then we prepared the

basis:

'You have a noble task.

You teach; you have stu

dents; the students might become future specialists on

Russia or night work as diplomats, etc., but many of these

students could be used by intelligence.

They might be sent

somewhere with special tasks.

Maybe you will tell us who

among the students

is preparing for government service,

how they are distributed,

etc.

During the first conver-

sation everything was made completely clcar...

He was not

at all willing to help or work for Soviet Intelligence.

He

was told that he must understand that in this case 'helping

Soviet Intelligence'

was a very broad term.

1 remember that

I told him:

'Understand, nobody is going to ask you that

you help our friends

over

there, or

me, if I should be there,

or that you do anything bad or conduct any kind of subver-

sive activities, that you organize explosions or murder.'

After the Soviet Union,

he was supposed to go to Italy,

to visit the Russicum

of the Vatican, and here KOZLOV

grabbed the subject and

began to ask questions

about this

school.

He told us a bit about the Russicum

and

we asked

him to write about it and he wrote down some names of the

professors who teach

Russian subjects..."

According to

NOSENKO, the discussion lasted about five hours; at its end

BURGI signed a short statement that he agreed "to assist

the organs of Soviet Intelligence."

NOSENKO first said that

it was

he who took this statement from BURGI but later said

he could not remember whether he or KOZLOV did this.

BURGI

was then

taken to a

hotel.

Chief of the

American-Canadian-British Tourist Section,

KOZIOV, and POSENKO

FEKLISOY told then that BURGI had

contact; the

first meeting in New York City took place the

second

or third time BURGl appeared and the New York Logal

Residency continued to meet with hin until the Rerolution in

Hungary

In late 1956.

NOSENKO later heard from soneone in

the emerican Department, First Chief Directorate that the

case was

closed.

KOZLOV reccived letters of commendation and conuses of one

NOSENKO's Infornation:

Virgil KRAFT, a clergyman

from the

Chicago area, visited the Soviet

Union as"

tourist in 1957 or

1952, and NOSEs was acsigned to be the responsible case offi-:

cer.

During an earlier trap to the Ussk, de KGB had learned,

KRAFT had been intimate with: a Sovies woran.

NOSENKO arranged

for her to come so bosion tron tier,

where

se was living in

1957 or 1558, in orcer to compronise

ERNT.

Although his wife

was

accompanying him in Moscow, AFAFT and thr Sovict woman wese

intimate in the latter's room in the Grund Hotel.

MOSENKO wAS

present at the tine

supervising the operation:

Photographs

were taken.

Then Militiaven broke into the room; finding KRAFT

and the woman in the nude; a recruitment approach was then rade

by DubiS, the Chief of the Tourist Department.

(NOSENKO had

been the

case otiicer and had handled the opcration thus far,

but he took no part in the confrontation or

recruitment approach

"because DUBAS

wanted it for hinsclf.") Although the recruit

ment was not firm, KRAFT and DUBAS

"hau an agreenent" that

nothing would be done about the compronise if KRAPT did not

criticize the soviet Union in lectures about his trip therc

which he was to give in the laited statos:

DUBAS again con

tacted KRAFT when he came to Moscow in 1963, and aftir this his

file was turned over to the First Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO

récalied that the first Chief Directorato "said that XRAFT was

not in a good region of the United states.

And also it smelled

like he had spoken of the approach

nie to hin."

Therefore,

NOSENiC concluded, he probably has not keen contacted in the

United Stites.

Recruitment of DREW (1952)

JOSENKO'S Information: Gecrge DRei,

an Aterican who

visited the Soviet Union in the spring of 1959, had originally

been the responsibility of V.M. IVANOV,

a CaSe

officer of the

section dealing with American and Canadian tourists.

By chance,

however, DREW became involved with NOSENKO's homosexual agents

VOL.KOV

and YEFRENOV (see Part V.D.2), and they reported this

to NOSINKO,

then the depuly chief of

the section.

IVANOV discussed the case with DUBAS and possibly GUSKOV, the

section chief,

and NOSENKO flew alone to Leningrad to make the

approach.

(IVANOV was not considered to be sufficiently ex-

perienced and his English

was not good.)

NOSENKO arranged for

DREW to be compromised in a leningrad hotel room with a homo

sexual agent of the local KGB handled by

a leningrad officer,

There is a

similarity between NOSENKO's dessrip-

tion of

the ban on recruitment approaches in 1959, which

prevented the Tourist Department fron taking advantage

of its compromising photography of BAlrETT and WILLER

FORD, and information provided by the earlier defector,

GOLITSYN.

GOLITSYN reported that on imericin employed

at the U.S. Embassy in Moscoi, possibly a code cleri, was

prepared

for recruitment on the basis of homosexual com

promise during 1959 and 1960, according to information

there was no question about the recruitrent being achieved:

"The only question was to where." At the time, however,

SHELEPIN had just become Chairman of the KGB and was

stressing ideological rather than blackmail recruitments.

He was shown these particular shotogrants but decided that

an approach on their basis would be too crude and that

another way should be found.

ilthough SHELEPIN did not

exclude the use of these photographs some time in the

future,

according to GOLITSYN,

he had reservations against

them at that tine for fear of the propaganda reper-

wussions if the attempt should fail and be exposed pub

licly.

GOLITSYN did not know whether the recruitment was

subsequently carried out. The essential differences: be

tween this account and that of NOSENKO are that GOLITSYN

implied the ban was in effect at least into 1960 and that

GOLITSYN appeared to ke speaking of a general prohibition,

This is what interested us.

But he didn't know arything.

He couldn't say anything. He provided only superficial infor

mation, nothing more."

• NOSENKO was then asked whether FRIPPEL would not have been

useful for coverage; of Americans visiting the Soviet Union.

He replied that the KGB had already had great success in this

by other means and launched into a long description of the

methods of covering foreign tourists in the USSR."

NOSENKO was present in the adjoining room when FRIPPEL waS

compromised by a Soviet female agent, Klara Konstantinovna

GORBACHEVA.

NOSENKO described the compromising scene in detail

as well as

the attempt by. a KGB technician to take motion pic

tures of these activities

through a two-way mirror, and the

confrontation with the militiamen who broke into the room.

: 130.

After returning to Geneva in 196 and during subseguent

debriefings and interrogations, NOSENKO made the following

additional staterents concerning the FRIPPEL case:

- Although he had personally recruited FRIPPEL, he

did not do Bo

alone; Col. V.D.

CHEL:OKOV, Deputy Chief

(and later Chief) of the Tourist Department, was present;

he and NOSE:KO "carried out the recruitrent together" in

early September 1959. NOSENKO was, hcwever, FRIPPEL'S

case officer.

- NOSENKO

attricuted his involvement in the FRIPPEL

recruitment to

following:

"In 1953, after 1958,

when I became the Deputy Chief of the section, my area

of activity was narrored down.

I didn't handle all the

tourists at that time.

I worked as the Deputy Chief of

the section and I had

my own little area--for example,

the

permanent representative of the Americar. E:press Company,

and besides that I began to collect all the material on

all American tourist firms which have anything to do with

Inturist and who send tourists to the USSR."

- FRIPPEL never provided

any information of value to

Soviet tourist operations.

- When NOSENKO began to

work in the l.S. Embassy

Section of the Anerican Department in 1960, he took FRIPPEL

with him because FRIPPEL was

acquainted with some Ameri

cans at the Embassy.

NOSENKO was

asked to question FRIPPEL

about the U.S. Erbassy and

such Embassy officers as George

WINteRs and Lewis W. BOWDEN, but FRIPPEL never told NOSENKO

anything along this line.*

- FRIPPEL provided no interesting information during

NOSENKO's two meetings with him in 1962 and 1963, when

FRIPPEL returned to the Soviet Union as a tour guide.

- NOSENKO met "pretty steadily" with FRIPPEL during

the period to January 1961, and once NOSENKO and his wife,

in company with CHELNOKOV and his wife, had dinner at

FRIPPEL'S home, where they met Mrs. FRIPPEL. Odette

FRIPPEL was unaware of her husband's status as a KGB agent,

and therefore NOSENKO and CHELNOKOV used Inturist cover

for their acquaintance with FRIPPEL.

KGB Second Chief Directorate case officers to visit agents

or notine her

Although unusual for

in their homes with wives present, NOSENKO explained

that

he went because he

"was invited,"

and CHELNOKOV went "be-

cause he was also involved in the recruitment."

- First as Deputy Chief of a section of the Tourist

as Deputy Chief and Acting Chief of

the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Department,

NOSENKO continued to meet with FRIPPEL in Moscow hotels

and restaurants.

Throughout this period, he was almost

invariably accompanied by CHELNOKOV:

I met with FRIPPEL alone, otherwise it was always with

CHELNOKOV. "

Usually NOSENKO would arrange these meetings

with FRIPPEL at CHELNOKOV's request and the two continued

to meet with FRIPPEL, despite his lack of production, be

cause they "kept hoping he would give something."

In a

different contest, but speaking of CHELNOKOV, NOSENKO EX-

"You see, never mind if you are a chief or a

deputy chief of a

two, or

three agents.

FRIPPEL had left the Soviet Union and NOSENKO had

been transferred and promoted to the position of Deputy

Chief of the

He met twice with FRIP

Soviet Union as

guide with groups of foreign visitors.

Both of these meetings were handled by NUSENKO alone, with-

(NOSENKO was unable to give the compo-

sition

of the journalist group or to recall where they

stayed in Moscow and where else they travelled in the Sov-

iet Urion.)

NOSENKO contacted him in Moscow to learn what

questions

the newsmen intended to ask KHRUSHCHEV during

a scheduled interview; subsequently NOSENKO acknowledged

that standard practice required visiting journalists to

submit their intended questions for KHRUSHCHEV in writing

to Soviet authorities prior to interviews.

NOSENKO had

6. Lee Harvey OSWALD (1959-60 and 1963);

As in the FRIPPEL case, NOSENKO was involved with lee

Harvey OSWALD during both periods of his assignment to the

Tourist Department of the Second Chief Directorate (1955-

1960 and 1962-1964).* While Deputy Chies öf the Anerican-

British-Canadian Tourist, Section, NOSENKO had a direct hind

in the decision in October 1959 that OSWALD has of no oper

ational interest to the KGB And should be returned inmediately

to the United States.

Before President Kennedy's assassi

nation in November 1963, when NOSENKÜ was again in the

Tourist Department as its Deputy. Chief, he was present at the

time the KGB Second Chief Directorate learned of OSWALD'S

application so the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City to se enter.

the USSR.

After the assassination, he also played a role in

the KGB investigations of OSWALD'S

activities during residence

in the Soviet Union fron Octover 1959 untii June 1903.

Collateral information relating to OSWALD's stay in the

Soviet Union, and particularly concerning any connections he

may have had

with Soviet intelligence,

is meager and indirect.

It derives almost entirely from indications ef

primary

interest by the KGB (among all Soviet Government organs) in

drawn from certain entries

in OSWALD's

certain statements made by his wife, Marina,

during inter-

views on behalf of the Warren Commission.

After President

Konnedy's death, the Soviet Government provided

the United

States with official documents and letters pertaining to

OSWALD's defection to the USSR, his suicide attempt, his

marriage, and other events inside the Soviet Union.

This

information from the soviet

Government generally agrees with

the information froin NOSENKO.

The materials furnished by

the Soviet Government make no mention aL any Soviet Intel.-

ligence interest, or lack thereof, in OSWALD.

In this sense NOSENKOs information is unique:

It was

and remains the

only

such information

available

on the 32

months of OSWALD's life in the USSR.**

NOSENKO's access to

• For continuity of presentation

both periods of NOSENKO'S

alleged involvement,

1959-1960 and 1963, are discussed in

this part of the paper.

#*. Independent sources,

however,

reported on visits by OSWALD

to tho soviet and Cuban

Embassies in Mexico City between 29

September and j October 1963 and on his (apparently overt) con-

tact with a KGB officer under Consular cover at the Soviet

Embassy there.

NOSENKO originally said he knew nothing of any

such contact.

In October 1966 he revised this to say that

OSWALD did not have contact with the KGB in Mexico City, NOSENKO

explained that he had been sitting in the office of Tourist De-

partment Chief, K.N. DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head-

quarters from the KGB legal Residency in Mexico.

The cable,

which NOSENKO said he did not personally see, reported that

OSWALD had visited the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City requesting

permission to return to the USSR and that he had dealt wich

Soviet Foreign Ministry personnel ondy.

Statements to ClA

On the basis of the Fl interviews of NOSENKO and the

sinilar inforcation which he had previously piovided ClA,

further debriefings were conducted by Cli on

3 and 27. July

1964.

New and explanatory information received Juring these

debriefings is presented below:

(1) KGB Interest in OSwALD

to remain in the Soviet Union, he was treated

routinely by

the KCB.

request, this vas reported

innediately to the Tourist Department,

noment that the KGB began to pay attention to hin.

Although the KGB con-

sidered it possible thai OShALD mishe be an American asechis

the KGB did nothing to investigate this possibility as

would be done

after

the person is alloved to stay in the

Soviet Union."

Surveillance of OSWALU was not increased

after his request, and OSWALD was not inte: viowed by the

KGS in an attempt

to establish his intentions.

There was

no attempt to debrief OSivALD because

"he lias not an inter-

esting person and wasn't normal."

OSWALD was never questioned

on his past nor asked to write an autobiography.**

materials and reports immediately available it was decided

that something wes not quite normal about oshard, and the

kub therefore had Inturist tell him that he would have to

leave the USSR when ais vIsa expired. OSMALD's suicide

attempt supported the Tourist Department's feelirg that

it had been

right in deciding to refuse OSKALD's request

for citizenship, particularly as the hospital also re

ported that he was not normal, and the Tourist Department

decided:

"We will do nothing; we

don't want to know him."

Inturist was suusequently told: "*There is no KGB interest

in him.

Do what you kant.

The KGB thought that he was

of no interest for the country or for the KGB, that he was

not normal, and that he

should leave the country."

The

Tourist Department and the

KGB in general thereupon "washed

their hands" of this natter.

There was never any

operational use of OSWALD nor was

there anything

in OShALD's file to indicate that the KGB

attempted to debrief him on his past service in the U.S.

Marine Corps or other matters; this

was because "he is a

very little person and also i: is felt that he is not nor-

mal, so the KGB is afraid to do this with him."*

The GRU

was not informed of OSWALD's defection.

Neither was any

attempt made to exploit OSWALD for propaganda purposes

in Moscow or in Minsk.

In short, there was no intelligence

interest or contact with OSWALD after the initial assess-

ment of abnormality.

(1i) KGB Interest in Marina OSWALD

The KGB had no linowledge or interest in Marina (nee

PRUSAKOVA) until she and OSWALD applied for permission to

register marriage.

In fact the KGB did not know that she

was a friend of OSWALD until this point, for there was no

surveillance on OSWALD to show that he

knew her.

When the

KGB learned of their relationship, checks were made of the

Archives of the Minsk KGB as well

is neighborhood checks and

checks at her place of employment.

The people where she

lived and worked and went to school considered her a simple

girl, not very clever, only fair in her studies, not an active

member of the KOMSOMOL.

She was a simple "philistine," an

uncultured girl more interested in

gossip than i. anythirg

Important. The KGB never considered recruiting her as an

informant on OSWALD "because it was considered dangerous to

recruit a wife to report on her husband." Nor was it con-

sidered to recruit her for use after she arrived in the

United States, "because she would tell him and also: she

would probably tell the Americans, based on the assessment

of the type of person she was."

(1i1) OSWALD's Marriage and Departure from the USSR

NOSENKO was asked why there were so few difficulties

in the way of Marina's marriage to a foreigner and her

departure from the Soviet Union,

He replied:

"The Soviet

law allows any Soviet citizen to marry a foreigner. It was

" NOSENKO subsequently derined this kos reservation about

OSWALD as fear of becoming involved with an unstable per-

easy In this case because OSWALD was already living and

working in the Soviet Union.

It would be sore difficult,

of course, with sourists or others who are in the Soviet

Union only for a short period and want to marry Soviet

citizens.

•* : Asked whether it is not unusully difficult

for Soviet citizens to leave the Soviet Union, NOSENKO

explained:

"In this case it was easier because Marina

was already married to a föreigner."

NOSENÄO was next

asked what office or level of the Government or Party

must make the final decision regarding Marina's marriage

tO OSKALD.

He described the procedure as follows: "They

would come to the Regional Registration Office to apply

to register their marriage.

(There) they will be told

that they will have to wait a week of two while they think

it over to be sure they want to get married.

During this

period the necessary checks are conducted.

The Regional

Office would call the Militia, and the Militia would call

the Minsk KGB.

The Minsk: KGB

said that it is all right

for them to got married--that the KGB has no objection.

But

it is the law that allows them to be married. There

are no formal approvals necessary."

Concerning the decision to permit the couple to leave

the USSR, NOSENKO said on 3 July 1964 that the decision

would be made on the local level, in Minsk, and that there

is no need to check in Moscow.

1964 he corrected

this statement to say that, while local authorities make

the decision,

it must be approved in Moscow by, he thought,

the Ministry

for the Preservation of Public Order (MOOP).

(IV) OSWALD'S Visit to Soviet Embassy in Mexico

Asked whether he had

any information on OSWALD's visit

to ::xico in September 1963, NOSENKO said that he knew oniy

that OSWALD had applied at the Soviet Embassy there to come

to the Soviet Union.

The Mexico City Legal Residency of the

KGB reported his visit to Headquarters by cable, requesting

inforra:ion; this was the first that the KGs First Chief

Directorate had heard

of OSWALD.

that ALEKSEYEV then came to V.D. CHELNOKOV or A.G. KOVALENKO

to ask about OSALD, and YOSENKO thought that he himself was

present at the time.

ALEKSEYEV was given the background on

OSWALD, including his suicide attempt and the fact that he

was not considered normal, and was told to advise the First

Chief Directorate that OSWALD should not be permitted to re-

enter the Soviet Union.

ALEKSEYEV then telephoned TURALIN

to relay this message.

NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD

had spoken at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and he knew

"By the time OSwALD applied for permission to marty, he had

already written the American Embassy in Moscow, through Soviet

(V) NOSEYKO's Comments on Possible KGB Involverent in the

Assassination

When first discussing

the OSWALD case with NOSENKO on 23

January 1964, a CIA case officer commented: "It is a very un-

fortunate thing that these prior events occurred in the Soviet

Union."

(NOSENKO apparently misunderstood the case officer's

intent, which was not to imply that the NOB was behind the

assassination, but only that the facE of OSALD's "defection"

placed

the USSR under probably untounded suspicion.) NOSENKO's

immediate response to this remark was:

"That is not correct.

This is putting a false color to it, I am your friend.

I am

completely with you,

and I will continue to work with you and

agäinst the Soviet Union in all respects.

But the truth

should always remain the truth.

No matter how I may hate

enou this cannot speak istan see do to the tact that

the Soviet Union cannot be tied into this in any way.

this because I know they were frightened of this man

(OSWALD]

and that everything should have been said to him or that he

should have been in

•God forbid!...

I know this because I sat

on this matier for

several days after the tragic matter occurred to the President.

To investigate in detail if anything had been done, particularly

by the local authorities,

that is, by the local KGB in

Belorussia..., I had to make a complete investigation and

even sent several workers down there to investigate--not

trusting official papers.

Even without specific orders I had

to make a complete investigation on my end of things because

If you want to know,

it would be a

greater

advantage to the Soviet Union if the

President were still

Kennedy because he was a personage who was a realist and looked

at many things in the eye boldly... In the history of any

intelligence service there have been assassinations of one

kind or another.

I can say this: That in our organization,

not even speaking of myself, nany persons were shocked by

che assassination--to think

that this should happen in the

wentieth century and in, of all places, the most powerful

soverhuent in the world."

Superv.sosy.Responsibiditien.and: Knowledge-of Tourist

Operations

Information from NOSENKO

In June 1958 there was a reorganization within the Tourist

Department of the Second Chief Directorate.

The Second Section,

which had theretofore concerned itself with operational activity

against foreign

tourists from all countries, was broken down into

separate sections; one section dealt with tourists from the United

States, Canada, and Great Britain, the other with tourists from

Europe, Latin America, and all other countries.

NOSENKO said

that he was promoted at this time to the position of Deputy Chief

of the first of these new sections.

NOSENKO's involvement in at least one major case, Lee Harvey

OSWALD, stems entirely from his having held this position.

It

is also on this basis that he was able to claim awareness of all

recruitments from among American tourists from mid-1958 until he

returned to the American

Department at the beginning of 1960.

His knowledge about

recruitments

is based additionally, he

said,

on the fact that some time between lay and October 1959, during

the tourist season, he was ordered by Ye. S. KIRPICHNIKOV,

GRIBANOV's secretary, to gather facts for GRIBANOV concerning the

use of tourist cover

by foreign intelligence organizationg during

the period from 1955 through 1958.

NOSENKO gathered this material

from earlier

annual reports of the Tourist Department and by talk-

Ing with various case officers in the department.*

On the basis of his general and supervisory experience in

the Tourist Department as well as his research for this paper,

NOSENKO had the following to say about Tourist Department opera-

tions prior to 1960 (taken

from the protocol he signed on this

subject on 25 February 1965) :

"Operations against tourists were developing slowly

during this period and very little was known by the KGB

about the use of tourism by American Intelligence at the

time I wrote the report in 1959.

No agents were definitely

uncovered among American tourists during the years 1958 or

1959 and, until 1960, no tourists were

'caught in the act'

of mailing letters, servicing deaddrops or contacting

agents, except one whose name I remember as MCGUIRE.

Questioned on this paper in February 1965, NOSENKO said he

did not remember whether he discussed it with GRIBANOV, nOr

could he recall any examples of the material he included in

it, what the paper said about CIA

tourist operations, or what

other U.S. Intelligence organizations were using tourism

as

• an operational cover in this period. He did remember,. how

ever.

that it incorporated statistical data on the growth

of foreign tourism.

which led to the discovery of McGUIRE's lecter mailing.

"I know of no case in which an imerican tourist was

and thereafter approached for recruitment by the KGB during

this period.

"I do not know of any such american tourists who were

CIA agents, and who were recruited by the KGB during this

period.

"In addition to M-GUIRE, the Seventh Department de-

veloped suspicions concerning a number of tourists, but

didn't learn of any specific intelligence connections.

against them, including vyemka (covert baggage

and the use of KGS agents, rone of these tourists

b.:

KGB Knowiedge from Seorge BLAKF

During the first week of June 1959, a three-day meeting was

held in Londor, England, between representatives of CIA and the

British Secret Intelligence Service

(sIs, commonly referred to as

MI-6)

on the subject of legal-travel" intelligence operations

against the USSR.

At the corclusion of this meeting there was

drawn up a 19 page document summarizing what had been discussed

at the meetings.

This summary

spelled out CIA operational doc-

trine pertzining to tourist operasions: including

agent-sporting

techniques, criteria for agent selection, agent assessment,

agent

training,

and tasks to be carried out

by tourist agents during

the coming (1959) tourist season.

It

stressed CIA's reliance

on tourists for the spotting, recontacting, assessing,

and

communicating with clandestine assets in the Soviet Union.

A

copy of the document as well, presunably, as other British doeu-

ments relating to the joint meetings was glven to George BLAKE,

who has admitted having made a phorographic copy which he passed

to the KGB. He gave the KGB this information in the summer of

1959.

* One Robert Alan MCGUIRE, a former: staff empioyce of CIA,

travelled to the Soviet Union as a tourist during April

and

May 1958.

Although he was debriefed on his return,

he had

no connection with CIA in preparation for this trip and

mailed no letters for CIA inside

the USSR,

While in the

Soviet Union, McGUIRE was approached on numerous occasions

by Soviets

seeking blackmarket deals., American girls, and

assistance in defecting to the Americans.

While en route to

Leningrad, his brief case was overtly searched by a customs

employee,

who confiscated a Radio Liberation script.

MCGUIRE

reported that he was compelled to sign a document which stated

that the script had been confiscated,

but the reasons for the

action were left blank.

NOSENKO

who has reported none of

these details,

MCGOWAN,

appears to have confused McGUIRE with Edward

a CIA agent who mailed a letter in Minsk in August

1958 and was detected doing so by the KGB; NOSENKO said

MCGUIRE mailed a letter in Minsk in 1959.

E January 1960 to January: 1962 (American Department)

1. Introduction

NOSENKO claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the U.S.

Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB Second Chief

Directorate.

from sometime in January 1960 until the first days

of January 1962.*

This section, in his. words, was working

against "the most important counterintelligence target in the

Soviet Union, " the permanent American representation in Moscow.

It regarded every American stationed there as a possible spy

and, simultaneously, as a target for eventual compromise and

recruitment.

The functions of the U.S. Embassy Section were described by

NOSENKO as being, first, to control all contacts by ambassy per-

sonnel with Soviet citizens; second, to evaluate information

collected from all possible sources on American Embassy employees:

and third, to use this information as a basis for planning and

carrying

out recruitment approaches.

The Americans' personal.

ities, jobs, personal relationships. weaknesses, daily routines,

security precautions, contacts with Soviet citizens, and the

major and

minor scandals in their Moscow lives formed the basis

for this "ork.

To gather such information, the section's officers

directed and debriefed large numbers of agents and informants.

including the indigenous employees of the Embassy, Soviet citizeng

moving in Embassy social circles, and third-country nationals with

American contacts, the officers also assigned tasks to and assim-

Ilated the reports from the numerous surveillance teams at their

disposal, and

they read and tried to exploit materials from tele-

phone taps and microphones placed in the offices and homes of

the Americans.

Each officer had a limited number of American

targets and attempted to become thoroughly familiar with ach:

annually, they submitted detailed operational plans to exploit

the knowledge they had gained of their target.

1961, NOSENKO said, special emphasis was placed within the section

On

"identifyirg intelligence officers at the Embassy and active

development of them, the acquisition of ciphers, and the detailed

and painstaking study of code clerks, creating the conditions on

the basis of which they can be recruited."

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO has said, he had

access to all information concerning its activities:

"Nothing

was hidden" from him.

On this basis, he expressed certainty

that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB did not recruit any Americans

associated with the Embassy, that no Americans assigned to the

Embassy were being handled in Moscow as KGB agents in this

period. and that.

in fact, the KGB had recruited no American

Embassy personnel since

"ANDREY. "** From continuing friendships

with his fellow-officers of 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO has also

claimed certainty that there were no KGB recruitments from the

time he left the section in January 1962 until the January 1964

trip to Geneva.

In debriefing and interrogating NOSENKO, CIA placed partic-

ular emphasis on his activities during the period January

1960 to January 1962, since this information was of special

meanwntle, no one replaced "NOSENKO"HS" Deputy chiet ee"che

Tourist Department's American Section because (as he explained

on 29 January 1965) the Tourist Department, which had earlier

operated against members of delegations and various other

categories of foreign visitors; was being reorganized in January

1960 for work against tourists alone and the Deputy Chief slot

was eliminated."

With the exception of A. A. DMITRIYEV, Marina

RYTOVA,

and

the homosexuals YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, NOSENKO turned

over all of his agents

to another officer in the section named

TIMOFEYEV.

NOSENKO said on 29 January 1965 that he had two

separate files on his agent Arsene FRIPPEL, a developmental tile

and an operational file, and that he turned the former over to

TIMOFEYEV. and the latter to V. D. CHELNOKOV, Deputy Chief of the

Tourist Department.

During later interrogations, however, NOSENXO

has said that he continued to handle FRIPPEL While in the U.S.

Embassy Section and was

the case officer during FRIPPEL's visita

to the Soviet Union in 1962 and 1963.**

NOSENKO's Iransfer to the U.S. Embassy Section

In December 1959, While serving as Deputy Chief of the

American-British-Canadian Section of the Tourist Department,

NOSENKO learned from K. N. DUBAS, the department Chief, of

to transfer him to the U.S. Embassy Section as Deputy Chief.

NOSENKO said he was opposed to the move and wanted to remain in

the Tourist Department:

"I was used to it there and wanted to

continue.

I wanted to stay in the Tourist Department.

the transfer/ was no promotion.

Here I was the Deputy Chief

of section

would be the same there.

But, of course, its more

important there.

The American Department is, of course, the most

important.

But here I was working against American tourists.

This is also important.

I showed Chad. proven/ my-

self there in '55,

'56, '57.

'58, and '59 and was considered to

be not a bad case officer.

And here, in the imerican Department,

I must show prove/ myself with new people."

asked DUBAS in December 1959 to "please fight for me to stay."

DUBAS later told NOSENKO that he had twice spoken to Second

Chief Directorate Chief O. M. GRIBANOV on his behalf, but to

no avail.

In January 1960 the official orders transferring

NOSENKO were issued.

On the day NOSENKO reported to V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the

American Department, to begin his new job, he was told to report

to GRIBANOV's office.

NOSENKO again expressed mis-

givings about the change of assignment.

GRIBANOV replied that

DUBAS had spoken to him about this but that ne, GRIBANOV, "had

his own plans and that was all." GRIBANOV told NOSENKO that

243.

* *

There was no change in the functions of NOSENKO's section,

however;

as before, it continued to be responsible for

operations against tourists from the United States,

England, and Canada.

FRIPPEL has reported that NOSENKO: continued to meet him

until he left the Soviet Union, in January 1961 and again

when he returned as a guide to tourist groups twice in

1962 and once again in 1963; see Part V.D.5.

he thought NOSENKO could bring "fresh air"

to the U.S. Embassy

Section's operations and that he was to pay particular attention

to operations against American code clerks, the "number ore

target."*

Neither GRIBANOV nOr KLYPIN told NOSEUKO why he had

been selected. for this position.or who had recommended him for

it.

NOSENKO was asked on 17 April 1964 whom he had relieved

upon reporting for duty in the U.S. Embassy Section.

He replied:

"Nobody."

He was then asked to identify the persons from whom

he had assumed certain of his duties as Deputy Chief of the

section (these are discussed in detail below). NOSENKO said that

he took the responsibility for maintaining the section file on

the security of

v. M. KOVSHUK. *the U.S. Enbassy from the Chief of the section.

Regarding his responsibility as case officer

NOSEVKO explained

cause former Security Officer Russell LANGELLE nad been declared

persona non grata in October 1959 and because his successor John

was not to arrive until March 1960, no ore in the section

had this responsibility wher he,

NOSENKO, arrived in January

Asked who had been LAiGELLE's case officer, NOSENKO IE

plied: "LANGELLE was handled by several people - by LA.S.T MALYU-

GIN, then after that by /V,A,/ KUSKOV, then by KOVSHUK, then

to his CIA handling officer:

"The task of strengthening of

work was particularly intensified after the appointment of

SHELEPIN to the KGB..•

In 1960, it was recommended in

KGB to intensify the work against the Americans at the U.S.

Embassy in Moscow, and against American colonies in other

countries..•

This question of intensifying work against the

Americans

was up before the Collegium of the KGB.

Thereafter,

there was a directive from SHELEPIN regarding the intensifi-

cation of work against the Anerican cIpher-clerks."

**There is an apparent contradiction between NOSENKO's desig

nation of KOVSHUK as Chiaf-af the First (U.S. Embassy) Sec

tion in 1960 and information earlier supplied by GOLITSYN.

GOLITSYN told CIA of a conversation he had with KOVSHUK in

•January 1961 in Moscow (see Part V,E. 3:C.2. concerning a

recruitment approach to the American code clerk James STORS-

BERG)

but at that time described KOVSHUK only as an American

Department officer, without indicating his position.

only time that GOLITSYN has given a position for KOVSHUK was

in the

context of questioning concerring KHRUSHCHEV's "Secret

Speech" denouncing STALIN in 1956; GULITSYN; said that at this

time KOVSHUK was Chief of the American Department (sic) of

the Second Chief Directorate,

On 16 February 1962 GOLITSYN

identified Vladimir PETROV as Chief of the "section concerned

with the American

Embassy of the

American Department of the

Second Directorate in 1960,, NOSENKO had identified PETROV

as Chief of the Second Section of the American Department,

which was concerned with the penetration of U.S. intelligence

operations inside the Soviet Union.

"LANGELLE was betore my time.

Two months later,

on

24 June 1964, NOSTIKO stated:

"In 1959 and possibly in 1958,

Mikhail Fedorovich BAKHVALOV wag the Deputy Chief of the U.s.

Embassy Section.

I replaced him in this position in 1960 and

he went to the Fifth (Eastern Countries) Department as Deputy

Chief®"*

On 8 September 1964 NOSENKO volunteered for the first

time that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief of the section, had been

the case officer for LANCELLE. Under interrogation

in early

1965, NOSENKO added that BAKHVALOV had also been responsible for

maintaining the file on the security of the U.S. Embassy.

At

this time he explained his earlier statement by saying that BAKH-..

VALOV had left the section before his arrival and had given the

file to KOVSHUK to hold for his successor:

The file continued to

be charged officially to BAKHVALOV, however, even though he was

no longer in the section, and NOSENKO arranged for the official

change of custody sortly after reporting for duty (see Part V.E.

3. f.).

NOSENKO said further, in January 1965, that BAKHVALOV

had shared responsibility for supervising code clerk operations

with KOVSHUK before NOSENKO arrived to assume these duties him-

self.

NOSENKO had been given a number of opportunities prior

to 24 June 1964 to identify BAKHVALOV as his predecessor, but

he did not do so. These are summarized below:

27 February 1964: NOSENKO was shown a photograph of V.A.

ALEKSEYEV, a Soviet who was in Japan from

July to September-

1961 as a member of a trade delegation. NOSENKO inmediately

recognized the face as that of the Deputy Chief of the Fifth

Department of the Second Chief Directorate.

He said that he

did not know this person's last name, but that his first name

and patronymic were

ikhail Fedorovich.

When shown the last

name ALEKSEYEV, NOSE:KO recognized it as an alias, but pro-

vided no further information concerning his true identity or

earlier service in the American Department.

10 June 1964: NOSENKO was asked to list in writing the

names

of KGB officers who had received various awards for

their service.

He wrote:

On this basis: NOSENKO was then

asked to list the officers who had joined the section between.

1956 and January 1960, when NOSENKO said he had returned. He

provided 14 names, but BAKHVALOV'S was not among them.

Asked

to name the officers who had left the section in the same period,

he named five, again omitting BAKHVALOV.

Duties and Knowledgeability

: Me

Introduction

Shortly after reporting for duty in the U.S. Embassy

Section and following his short discussion with GRIBANOV,

NOSENKO met with Department Chief KLYPIN and Section Chief

KOVSHUK to discuss

his responsibilities

and functions in

the section.

Repeating what GRIBANOV had already

said,

KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's sost important single respon-

sibility. in the section would be supervision of all KGB

operational activity against American military and State

Department code clerks stationed in Moscow.

As for the

other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN suggested a division

of labor under which KOVSHUK

would be responsible for super

vising operations against State Departrent personnel and

NOSENKO would supervise work against the Arny, Air Force,

and Naval attaches and their assistants.*

NOSENKO #as also

made responsible for maintaining certain files in the section.

On 19 February 1965 NOSENKO signed an interrogation proto.

col. which he

agreed contained a listing of his

principal

responsibillites during 1960 and 1961. It read in part:

"During the eptire

41) Access

Functions as Coneral Deputy and Acting Chief of Section

Since his defection NOSENKO has maintained under re

peated interrogation that as general deputy to KOVSIUK, with

the responsibility of taking over in KOVSHUK's absence, he

had acces: to all information on the section's activities

and was obliged to keep

current on this information.

On

this basis he has been able to assure his questioners that

the KGB was completely unsuccessful in its attempts to re-

cruit Americans assigned to the Embassy in these two years.

NOSENKO has also said at various times that his access to

section files and his discussions with section officers made

it certain that there were also no successes from 1953 to

1960 and from January 1962 to January 1964.

His statements

on this subject during the February 1965 were distilled in

a protocol which NOSENKO signed on 20 February (quoted in

full):

"1.

As the only Deputy to the Chief of the

American Embassy Section,

First Department,

Second

Chief Dircetorate, KGB, Vladislav Mikhaylovich KOV

SHUK, from January 1960 to January 1962, one of my func

tions was to serve as KOVSHUK's general deputy and to

assume the rights and responsibilities of Chief of the

Section during KOVSHUK's absence.

In order to perform

this function I had the right and the obligation of

knowing the details about every important activity of

the section against the American Embassy and its per-

sonnel. No activity of this nature was withheld from

me.

"2.

As Deputy Chief of the Section I know defi

nitely that no U.S. officials serving in the Embassy

were agents of the

KGB or reporting unofficially in

any way to the KGB during my service in the Section.

There were no approaches or recruitments made by the

• Section during

the period January 1960 to January 1962

against personnel of the American Embassy,

including

personnel of the State Department, the offices of the

Military Attaches (Army, Navy, and Air), the Department

of Agriculture and USIA,

including Marine guards, Army

sergeants,

State Department code clerks

and Army code

clerks except against STORSBERG and KEYSERS, both un-

successful approaches.

*VOLKOV, YEFREMOV, Johan PREISFREUND, FRIPPEL, and

respectively, who are discussed in other parts or this

paper.

At other times NOSENKO has named additional agents

he handled in this period; they are discussed below.

•(11) Duties

On 29 January 1965, NOSENKO was questioned concerning

ticularly bis function of supervising activity against code

No.

to hear from the source (emphasizedl

directly,

what is going on, and how it is going on, to get

Because the source will tell the case

officer,

then the case officer will tell you.

Maybe sometimes he will not give you every detail,

every intonation.

But in some cases, it is neces-

sary to feel this.

But, of course, it depends on

the agent, on the target, whether you wilt 6o or

not go.

It's very difficult, again, to say.

Could you say that you met 50 per cent of the

section's agents?

No, I can't say.

Fifty per cent or 75 per cent?.

I can't answer you.

What about your functions as a

supervisor in re-

gard to salehouses, to "K.K.'s" and "Ya.K. 's"

Oh.

I myself had a file on my flat, a yavochnaya

kvartira, which I brought from the Seventh

Tourist

Department.

It was my own.

GRYAZNOV

had his own yavochneya kvartira.

KOSOLAPOV had

also his own

yavochnaya kvartira. And not one of

us had a conspiratIve apartment.

Which I had from the Seventh.

And, by the way, when

I was leaving the First

to the Seventh.

And not one of you had a conspirative flat.

No, because the section had only -how many?-

[P.I. | MASSYA had one conspirative.

[V.P.]

FEDYANIN had one conspirative, and then there was

one conspirative flat,

where, in fact,

an agent

was living.

In the First Section there were

three or four conspirative flats.

But among you, GRYAZNOV, and KOSOLAPOV there was

none?

Only "Ya.K.'s".

#А "K.К." (konspirativnaya kvartira- conspiratorial apart -

ment)

is defined by NOSENKO as a safehouse or apartment owned

and maintained 'by the KGB. A "Ya.K." (yavochnaya kvartira-.

meeting apartment) is an apartment occupied by a tenant who

1s perhaps subsidized by the KGB and absents himself when

there is a need to use the apartment for meetings or other

activities.

The "K.K." is used for more sensitive operational

purposes, he said.

was there

some central control of the use of the

"Ya.K.'s"?

What kind of control?

Who would be using then, when they would be using

them, under what

conditions?

No.

The case officer who was working with it

decides how to use this flat or how not to use

it, et cetera, et cetera.

Besides that, very

often we were using rooms in hotels.

So GRYAZNOV would take any of his operational

activity to his "Ya.K."?

He would also meet with his agents, with his

operational contacts in hotel rooms.

KOSOLAPOV

was meeting his agents in his own "Ya.K."; NO-

SENKO was meeting

his agents or operational con

tacts in his own

"Ya.K.".

Could GRYAZNOV or KOSOLAPOV ever use these "Ya.K. 'g"

without your knowing about it?

Of course. It's their own flat.

But you're supervising their work?

Must I kéep them like a little, little child?

No,

no.

They don't have to report to

me:

"Today

I go to meet my agent at my flat."

They can use them whenever they like without checking

with you as supervisor?

Of course, of course. They are meeting their own

agents.

But usually they are going to meet

maids

or they don't have to report.

There is nothing

active and there is....The file is going on.

What about operational vehicles? Automobiles?

You see, we lad one automobile for the whole

department.

this, we could apply, when

necessary, to the officer on duty for the Second

Chief Directorate and he would give a car, be

cause he has a number of cars at his disposal.

Q:

Approximately how much of your time did you spend

supervising GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV?.

A:

I can't say.

Q:

Was it the most important function?

•A:

Yes, it was important.

All work in the First

Section was important.

This was the most impor-

tant.

But one day I could devote the whole day

to code clerks, the next day maybe half the day,

maybe two hours

in

the day.

The rest of the day

I will be absent.

I will be meeting with KLYPIN,

or I will be having a meeting with surveillance,

or I will be at anther place.

The third day,

No, I

tion.

Additional Duties in KOVSHUK's Absence

As Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section, one of

NOSENKO's responsibilities was to serve as Acting Chief

when KOVSHUK was absent from the office.

NOSENKO recalled

that be fulfilled this function during

KovSHUK's two 30-day

leave periods in 1960 and 1961, but he did not remember

when this leave occurred in those years.

He also

served as

Acting Chief for about a month in the summer of 1960 when

KOVSHUK was in the KGB hospital with heart trouble and for a

week or two some time in 1961 when KOVSHUK was 111 again..

NOSENKO wag unable to recall any operational or inspection

crips that KOVSHUK made in 1960 or 1961, and the only other

specific time that he could renember kOVsHUK being absent

was for several days in connection with preparations for

President Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in

1960.

NOSENKO's description of his duties in KOVSHUK's ab

sence was summarized in a protocol which he signed on 3 March

1965:

"I do not remember any particularly important

operational decistons I made as Acting Chief of Sec-

tion, nor any unusual things that happened during

these times.

Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations

(1) Introduction

Among the numerous KGB activities against American code

clerks in Moscow which SOSENko has discussed are five opera

tions wherein the KGB intended or effected approaches for

recruitment/defectior purposes.

According to NOSENXO, none

was successful.

The fiva major cases are reviewed separately

below, one of then in the context of duty trips abroad by

NOSENKO's subordinate KOSOLAPOV. **

NOSENKO said that, upon assuming responsibility for

supervising operations

*The Edmund STEVENS case is. discussed in Part V.C.2.

#*GOLITSYN on 20 March 1962 identitied KOSOLAPOV's photograph

as that of a veteran KCB officer

with whon he was personally

acquainted.

GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV had entered the KGB

In about 1952 and had served for two or three years as a

member of the First (American) Department of the KGB First

Chief Directorate under United Nations cover in New York City;

subsequently he had worked for two or three years in the

First Chief Directorate at KGB HeadquarterS.

According to

GOLITSYN, the bachelor KOSOLAPOV was transferred to the KGB

Second Chief Directorate some time prior to 1960 in line with.

a KGB policy for only married men to be sent abroad.

1960, GOLITSYN said, KOSOLAPOV was working against code clerks

stationed in the American Embassy in Moscow.

He added that

KOSOLAPOV speaks excellent English.

Prior to GOLITSYN'S

identification, CIA had no indication of intelligence acti

vity on KOSOLAPOV's part:

Between February 1953 and April

1955 he was assigned

to the United Nations Secretariat Trans-

lation Unit as a translator; in August 1958 he had been an

interpreter at the Geneva Conference on Nuclear Test Detection;

in September 1959 he accompanied KHRUSHCHEV on his trip to

the United States (sce Part V.EF.3.d. which desoribes the

role of NOSENKO's target. John ABIDIAN in connection with the

KHRUSHCHEV trip).

KOSOLAPOV's English is flawless.

167.

On the several operations ageinst military code clerks

which NOSENKO has described and in which he has claimed a

personal role, his greatest detail and emphasis has been given

to the case of James Harry STORSBERG.

In 1952 NOSENKO said

that.

in line with CRIBANOVis instructions that he pay parti-

cular attention to code clerk operations,

he deroted most of

his tine

for

almost a year to che STORSBERG operation, and

played a personal role in the unsuccessful KGE appoach; he

describsd in

the first person his

conversatior. with SICRSBERG.

During tre 1964 to 1966 period, NUSENKO denied not orly that

he had personally participated in this way but also tha: he

had ever claimed to have done: he continued to say: however.

that he supervissa the operation from beginnirg to

end.

AC-

cording to NOSENKO, this operation got under

way with the se

cruitmert of a third-national agent (johan PREISFREUD, a

Finn) sore time in the farse. half of 1960,

The specific aim

in usirg this

agent was to involve STorSbERG in compIonising

activities, which

would then form the basis for the approach.

The operation dragged on through 1960 and

until the spring,

summer, or autum: oi 1961; at this time N.S

SKVORTSOV, a KGB

officer, was introsuced in the guise of a wealthy frerch busi

nessman to continue the development of compromising informa-

tion.

PREISFREUID was then withdrawn from che operation.

Several weeks later STORSEERS was approached, principally on

the basis of his financial need,

but he rejected the KGs bid

and the coeratior was over.

NOSENKO was certain that STORS-

BERG had not reported the approach and said that the kes would

use this fact as an additioral eiement of pressure should

STORSBERJ again ze posted outside the United States.

NOSENKO

also kred that GOLITSYN had reported to CIA corcerning KGB

modus operandi in chis case as well as PREISFREUND'S part in

it.

GOLITSYN in early 1962 had, in fact, told CIA about

PREISFREUND having been used by the KGB in an operation agains

an American stationed in Moscow.

Contrary to NOSENKO's into-

mation. te said that this American had been approached--and

recruited-by the KGB at the end of 1960,

A second iten from GOLITSYN may also relate to the STORS-

BERG operation:

COLITSYN told of learning in the sprirg of

1960 that the KCB had developed a military code clerk in Mos-

cow to the point that recruitment was virtually assured.

AC-

cording to U.S. Army records, only two military code clerks

were stationed there at that time, STORSBERG and his superior

William S. HURLEY,

the military communications officer who

additionally performed cryptographic duties.

NOSENKO has

said that there was no KGB operation against HURLEY, and

HURLEY has reported no approach.

In addition to the detailed information given by NOSENKO

on

this case.

the FBI and Army. Inteiligence have interviewed

STORSBERG (who corfirmed NOSENKO's account and denied recruit-

ment) and CIA has talked to the KGS agent PREISFREUND (Who

also generally confirmed the information given by NOSEyKO

but did not know the outcome of the case.

The results of

these interviews. together with information from COLITSYN and

'from other sources, are sumarized in this order below

(ç) Information from PREISFREUND

CIA initially interviewed PREISFREUND on 8 July 1965 in

(NOSENKO himself had suggested that PREISFKEUND

would confirm his story of the STORSBERG case.)

During this

first meeting with him, PREISFREUND correctly identified photo-

graphs of KoVsHUK, NOSENKO, and STORSBERG.

He maintained, how

ever, that his relationship with KOVSHUK and NOSENKO was strictly

that he had never had anything to do with

the KGB, and that he did not know what the initials "KGB" stand

Toward the end of this meeting, PREISFREUND allowed that

he may have been unwittingly involved in some activity

On 9 July 1965 PREISFREUND described how he had been

explaired that KOVSHUk was unavailable and that the iGs wanted

introduction between STORSBERG

and a Soviet female, Irina, the daughter of a Soviet general.*

PREISFREUND then left Moscow, and when he returned about two

months later, he took STORSBERG to the Peking Restaurant, where

the introduction was effected.

PREISFREUND, STORSBERG, Irina,

and another girl then went to

PREISFREUND'S

hotei, where STORS-

BERG and Irina were intimate.

PREISFREUND said on 10 July 1965 that he was fairly certain

his recruitment took place in early 1960, probably in March or

At the time KOVSHUK had refused to explain what the KGB

wanted him to do; he said only that they would talk about it

later but assured PREISFREUND that he would not be asked to

undertake anything detrimental to Finnish

interests; nor did

KOVSHUK establish any means of communications with PREISFREUND,

telling him only that the KGB would know where to find him.

PREISFREUND subsequently visited the USSR on several occasions,

but no contacts were made.

Just as he was beginning to believe

that the affair had been forgotten, NOSENKO contacted him at

his room in the Berlin Hotel in Moscow.

to explain his

earlier statement that NOSENKO first met with him two weeks

after the recruitment, PREISFREUND said he could not remember

it was, but that it was definitely on another

trip to Moscow and that it was probably several months later.

PREISFREUND was asked how he had first met STORSBERG.

and recalled

that NOSENKO had simply told him to go there and "find Jim;"

it was only with some difficulty that he finally managed to

strike up an acquaintance at the bar.

the Finnish Embassy in Moscow through a mutual Finnish acquaint-

Throughout this initial period, NOSENKO and KOVSHUK made

repeated promises that once the introduction of STORSBERG to

the Soviet female had been accomplished, there would be no more

demands made of PREISFREUND by the KGB.

PREISFREUND added:

According to NOSENKO, this was Irina LEBEDOVSKAYA, an

agent of the U.S. Embassy Section who was handled by A.V.

Information from GOLITSYN

Goritsyn, who had sorver the HGB most recently as a counter-

intelligence officer in Heisinki during 1960 and 1961, reported

separately two possibly related leads to operations against Am-

Moscow.

One of

these was a developmental operation against a military

code clerk which the KGB

aimost certain of success,

the

other a recruitment approach to an Emoassy employee which GOLIT-

SYN was told had been successful.

GOLTISIN learned these two

items

of information

from different Kos Second Chief Directorato

officers

at different times.

GOLITSYN provided the first of these leads

1961, when he reported information he said he

Icarned during

friend GRYAZNOV al KGB Head-

quarters in Moscow some time

GRINZNOV told cortest that he, GRYAZNOV,

tary code clerk

"99 per cent sure"

that the recruitment

approach to this cose clerk would be suc

subsequently nerrored the time of his conver-

with GRYAZNOV down

"April or May 1960"

and quoted

GRYAZNOV as saying that the KGB

"is certain that the recuitment

is preparea and will be successful."

GOLIPSYN also said that

the recruitment plan for this operation "evidently involved a

woman," but could provide no further details.

During these same

talks, according to GOLiTSYN, GRYAZNOV saId

that although the

KGB had earlier recruited U.S. Depurtment of State code clerks

in Moscow, this would be the first recruitment of a code clerk

in the office of the American Military Attache since the estab-

lishment of the Second Chief Directorate's American Department

(in the 1940's) .

GOLITSYN reported on the second operation on 26 February

1962, while discussing the *GB agent PREISFREUND. GOLIISYN

said

that he first met PREISFREUND when the latter went to the

Soviet Embassy in Helsinki in connection with an application

for travel to the USSR.

On several later occasions,

said, the two men had drinks together in Helsinki cafes.

According to GOLITSYN, PREISFREUND had been used in the recruit-

ment in Moscow of at least one American who "could have been a

code clerk or a diplomat."

He also knew that the recruitment

had been accomplished

"in 1960, at the end of 1960" and that

PREISFREUND, having met the target at America House in Moscow,

had helped to set up the target for the recruitment approach

by involving him in speculatory activities and by arranging his

introduction to various KGB female agents.

GOLITSYN thought

that PREISFREUND had dropped out of the case after "he had helped

to create the circumstances" and had not taken a direct part in

GOLITSYN could mean either Panoshchik (assistant)or Zamessitel!

(deputy).

The CHEREPANOV papers snow that KOVSHUK was Deputy

Chief of the Department as late us 1953.

NOSEYKO said that, as

a result of a drinking incident, KOVSHUK was demoted from De-

puty Chies of the American lepartrent to Chief of its American

Embassy Section in 1959 and heid this position until carly 1962.

GOLITSYN said he had known KOVSiUK for about ter. years and

characterized him as a capable officer with about 15 years of

KGB experience, at least ten of then in the American Department,

In about 1956,

according to COLITSYN,

KOVSHUK was hanäling KGB agent Henry SHAPIRO.

CiA records show

that in addition, KOVSHUK was involved in the Moscow and wash-

Ington phases of the "AYDREY" case (he was idertified by Dayle

James STOPSBERG, and in the interrogations

of CIA officers

Russell LNGELIS and Richard JACOB.

#*GOLITSYN's passport and travel records heid by CIA confirm that

COLITSYN travelled only twice to the Soviet Union after his

arrival in. Helsinki on 20 July 1960.

The first of these trips

was on 19 January 1961, when he flew directly from Helsinki to

Moscow; he returned to

Helsinki by rail a week later, on 28

January. GOLITSYN's second trip to the Soviet Union was from

9 to 15

April 1961, when he appears to have spent all or most

of this period in Leningrad.

A Finnish national, whom COLITSYN

had been developing in Helsinki, has reported that he met with

GOLITSYN in Leningrad

on a daily basis from 10 through 13 April

1961.

Moreover, GOLITSYN has never mentioned being in Moscow

during this time. Since GOLITSYN remained in Helsinki from

April until December 1961, when he defected, it appears that

he erred by one month in reporting the date of his conversa-

tons in the American Department and that he learned of the

second lead some

time during the week of 19 January 1961. This

is the same conversation of which NOSENKO spoke several times

in 1962 and subsequently (see above) • NOSENKO has always

maintained that he was out of Moscow on leave at the time of

GOLITSYN '9 visit

and that this was in the summer of 1961. When

he was told in February. 1965 that GOLITSYN was in Moscow. in:

January 1961, NOSENKO replied that CIA was either wrong or

was attempting to deceive him.

NOSENKO declined to Change

his story os the summer leave.

(e) Information from other Sources

Information available to CIA indicates that the Attaches of:

the three U.S. military services represented in Moscow shared

a single cryptographic center as of 1960 and 1961 and that;

except for overlapping assignsents during periods of turnover,

there was normally only one military code clerk assigned to the

Embassy at any particolar time.

This military code clerk was

responsible for enciphering and deciphering the traffic of all

three military services.

In practice,

at least one other men-

ber of the Attache staff in Moscow has held a cryptographic

clearance and has been trained and has

performed the function

of back-up for the military code clerk during periods of the

latter's absence from the Moscow Embassy or inability

to per

form his functions for other reasons.

STORSBERG was the only military code clerk assigned to the

Moscow Embassy from February 1960, when his predecessor, Everett

HOBSON, was reassigned, until September 1961, when his successor,

ZUJL'S, arrived.

STORSBERG himself arrived in Moscow in

January 1960 and departed in November 1961.

During the period of STORSBERG's tour in Moscow, back-up

cryptographic duties were performed by the Military Communica-

tions Officer, CHO-2 HURLEY:

HURLEY performed these duties on

a number of occasions, including the night of the approach to

STORSBERG, and he could be loosely termed a code clerk.*

Addi-

tionally.

he performed repair work on the cryptographic machines

and directed certain other sensitive activities at the Embassy.

HURLEY's tour in Moscow began

shortly before STORSBERG's, in

December 1959, and he served there until June or July 1962.

The only other person performing official functions in the

military code IO0T

the 1960-1961 period was James KEYSERS,

who arrived in Moscow on 22 December 1960 and was assigned to

the office of the Air Force Medical Officer.

As a concurrent

secondary assignment, KEYSERS worked as a clerk-typist in the

office of the Air Attache.

From February until mid-April 1961,

as a collateral

duty, KEYSERS worked in the joint military code

he was in training to serve as back-up cryptographer.

He was relieved of this duty in April 1961 for reasons of low

* Although NOSENKO has distinguished between STORSBERG's func-

tion as "military code clerk" and HURLEY's duties

as "mili-

tary code machine mechanic," he said on one occasion that

he considered both to be within the general category of

"military code clerks."

NOSENKO reported that there was no

KGB operation against HURLEY.

aptitude and lack of interest; in June 1961 he was removed from

Moscow because of reported homosexual activities.*

NOSENKO has described an operation

against KEYSERS (see

below), but because of the date of KEYSERS' arrival in Moscow,

he must be ruled out as a candidate for the first of GOLIT-

SYN's two leads discussed above.

On

the basis of available

information, it appears that the subject of this lead must

have been either STORSBERS Or HURLEY, the only two "military

code clerks" in Moscon in the spring

of 1960.

The subject

Of COLITSYN's second lead could have been STOPSBERG, HURLEY.

or, in fact, anyone else at the Inbassy, although GOLITSYN

suggested that he might be a code clerk and might be a mili

tary man. By his statement that there was no KGB operation

against HURLEY, together with his description of the opera-

tion against STORSBERG beginning in the spring of 1960 and

his (and PREISFREUND's) assertion that PREISFREUND took part

in only one operation for the KGB--that against STORSBERG--

NOSENKO has said in effect that both of GOLITSYN's leadg were

to the STORSBERG operation, which ended in failure.

This con-

flicts with GOLITSYN's report that PREISFREUND was involved

in a successful recruitment operation in late 1960.

There are

also inconsistencies between the NOSENKO and GOLITSYN leads

as regards the progress of the operation. GOLITSYN reported

that recruitment

of a code clerk was. "99 per cent" assured

in May-June 1960, whereas NOSENKO and PREISPREUND describe

an operation which, at best, was just becoming active at that

time.

GOLITSYN, in reporting his second lead, said that the

operation in which PREISFREUND participated culminated "in

late 1960:" NOSENKO reported that the only operation in which

PREISFREUND took part ended in an unsuccessful approach to

STORSBERG in "mid-1961" or, on other occasions, in "autumn

1961."

only once to Helsinki, and KOSOLAPOV at:

that time succeeded in his mission of accompanying-togetrer.

Prancis JENNER, by train to Moscow.

(The KGB later learned

that JENNER W2S

not a code cleri but a pouch cleck who also met

couriers at the Moscow airport, HOSENKO said, and this KGB iden

tification of JENNER's specialty is confirmed by U.S. Department

of State files.) The report by NOSENKO on KOSOLAPOV is contra-

dicted by two sources, travel records available to CIA and the

KGB defector GOLETSYN.

Statements made by JEUNER in 1960 and 1962 parallel those

Of NOSENKO in 1964 and 1965 to the extent that two young

soviets,

a man and a woman, did converse with him on the train, and later

JENIER did encounter the same woman at a Moscow airport.

Never-

records contradict NOSENKO's statement that

ROSOLAPOV was the Soviet male aboard the train with JENNER on the

"24-hour journey.

TDY

Although NOSENKO insisted

that KOSOLAPOV was on a single

to Finland,

in early

1960, travel records show that KOSOLA-

POV

(under a different identity) went to helsinki in both the

spring and fall of 1960.

Travel records on the second Helsinki

TDY by KOSOLAPCV, on which NOSENKO has rot reported, are borne

out by GObITSYN.

GOLITSYN said that KOSOLAPOV, in order to lay

the groundwork for a future relationship in Moscow, accompanied

a U.S. Embassy code clerk by train from Helsinki about November

1960, of perhaps as late as the beginning of 1961. Again on

the basis of travel records, it has been deterrined that on

16 November 1960 KOSOLAPOV was a fellow passenger of an Azerican

code clerk naned john W. GARLAND on the daily train from Hel-

sinki to MoscOh.

The following discussion of the TDY'S of KOSOLAPOV is

divided into three parts:

travel, the early 1950 TDY, and the November 1960 TDY.

He wanted to Bend KOSOLAPOV tO Hel-

sinki with the mission of returning with JENNER on

the same train; during which time KOSOLAPOV was to

study his behavior. JENNER was young and so was

KOSOLAPOV.

Question:

NOSENKO:

How old was JENNER at the time?

I don't know.

We sent GRYAZNOV's agent, a ballerina,

first name is Yeva, but I don't remember her last

name; her

code name was "SOLISTKA"

She was placed

on the train in Vyborg as if she had been visiting

someone there

and was returning to Moscow.

The main

idea was to place an agent near JENNER before he

even arrived

in toscow.

We wrote a proposal to the

Chairman of the KGB giving the reasons for doing this.

We explained that we had usually only one year in

which to

work.

The agent "SOLISTKA" met JENNER and

spoke with him.

KOSOLAPOV also became acquainted

with JENNER and spoke with him, but I can't say that

they were all speaking together at one time. She

gave JENNER a telephone number.

Question: A KGB telephone number?

NOSENKO:

Of course not; it was her own telephone number, but

he didn't call her.

We then noticed that he wasn't

working in the code room but in the mail room.

that was interesting too.

We waited one or two

months for the call to come, but nothing happened.

When JENNER once went to the railroad station or

airport alone to meet the couriers, we sent her with

GRYAZNOV by car in an attempt to have them meet

again.

JENNER saw her but did not approach (her).

Instead, he turned in the other direction.

Only

later did we learn that he is a very quiet person.

There was nothing else on JENNER at all except a

suspicion that he may have been a homosexual, but

there was no proof.

He was like a child.

Question:

How much time did you have between the time of the

anketa's arrival and the time of JENNER's arrival?

NOSENKO: A month, plenty of time to prepare.

Question: A month?

NOSENKO:

Well, approximately a month.

The usual approval

from

the Central Committee was necessary so that

KOSOLAPOV could go abroad.

Question:

NOSENKO:

Who wrote this?

I prepared the kharakteristika (official form] on

Office.

NOSENKO :

Question:

LOSENKO:

It was the idea of the group:

Did you advise KOSOLAPOV on what his role was to be

before he left--what he was to do?

I was discussing this case with GRYAZNOV and kOSO-

LAPOV, and maybe we discussed it with KOVSHUK on the

day: before KOSOLAPOV left.

Was "SOLISTKA" an experience agent?

She had been working before 1960, but I don't know

for how long.

Who handled her before GRYAZNOV?

Question:

HOSENKO:

I don't know.

Question:

How did you coordinate this trip of KOSOLAPOV's with

other units,

for example, with the (KGB] First Chief

Directorate

(FCD) ?

HOSENKO :

KOSOLAPOV wrote a cable saying that he was coming

for two or three days.

Question:

SOSENKO:

Did you approve this cable?

I didn't sign it, but I read it, and then we took it

to KLYPIN for his

signature.

Once it was signed,

KOSOLAPOV took it to the Second (European) Department,

FCD.

Question:

What cover did KOSOLAPOV use for this trip?

NOSENKO: I don't remember.

him?

NOSENKO: He was alone.

reported that he was approached on the train from Helsinki

by two young

"a boy and a girl, probably uni-

versity stusents."*

The two Russians struck

up a corver-

sation and were

soon baiting him on

the question of racial

discrimination in the United States.

They said that they

might see

JENNER in Mosccw.

three months later, on

29 June, JENNER was performing his normal duty of escort-

ing Enibassy

couriers to Sheremetevo Airport when he was

again apprcached by the russian girl, Yuli, who acted

to see hin and asked him to go outside to talk.

Yuli explained that she was waiting to say goodbye to

friend who was leaving

flight to Irkutsk (JENNER had

the Irkutsk flight depart

a half hour earlier)

told JENNER that her male

companion on the train trip to

Moscow, Yura,

had returned to his studies in Vyborg.

Interspersed

Yuli's questions concerning JENNER's

impressions and

personal activities in Moscow were others

about how often he came to the airport and how he liked

his job at the Embassy.

When JENNER said he must leave,

she gave him her telephone rumber in Moscow and insisted

that he call her.** She advised JENNER that "it would be

better if you did not mention our conversation to anyone."

- Besides information about his Soviet companiong on

Moscow journey, JENNER also toid U.S. Department of

State security officials about sexual advances made by

his first maid in Moscow and about provocative clothing

worn by his second maid.

(NOSENKO has not indicated that

either of these two women was a KGB agent, but has said

in another context that all

maids of American code clerks

were KGB agents or informants.)

- CIA investigations showed that I. Ye. SERGEYEV,

KGB officer and

Soviet Consul in Helsinki, contacted

the police chief there on 31 March 1960 to ask his assist

ance in locating

an American named Paul F. JENNER who was

due to arrive in Helsinki the day before.***

che November 1960 TDY (GARLAND Case)

Apart from denying that it ever too: place, NOSENKO has sai

nothing

about a trip

to Helsinki by KOSOLAPOV in lovember 1960,

but GLITSYN said

such a trip occurred and related it to an in-

cipient KGB operation against an American code clerk.

GOLITSYN was not posted to the KGB Legal Residency in lel-

gink until July 1960, 1.e., aiter KOSOLAPOV's first trip to

Helsinki, under the KOLOSOV alias.

He has reported that at

"about the end of 1960, about Wovember or possibly by the begin-

ning of 1961," the KGB Secord

Chief Directorate sent a teleg:an

to the Helsinki Legal Residency.

The teicgram advised that an

American code clerk would

arrive in Helsinki in trisit to

Moscow; the responsible case officer wouls be KOSOLAPOV, Wio

was being sent to lelsinki under an alias and under Yreshtora

to strike up

an acguaintance to be con-

tinued with the American in Moscow.

she following extracts are from the transcript of GOLITSYN's

further remarks on this subject in early 1962:

question:

You say that around November 1960 KOSOLAPOV came

to Finland?

GOLITSYN: Came to Finland.

He came under cover?

Question:

GOLITSYN: Yes.

Question:

Under

a new identity? With an alias?

GOLITSYN:

Yes, as an employee of Trade Union (Vnesitorg) .

But, of course, there

may be sone different dates.

Maybe November.

end of 1960 or it can be the beginning cf

(iv) KGS-Polish UB Activities Against MORONE

(a)

Introduction

In 1961 CIA learned from a Polish source who furnished

much

reliable and sensitive information that, with the assist

ance of its Polish counterpart, the Office of Security (UB),

the KGB in November 1960 began

using a female agent against

Joseph MORONE, a U.S. Department of State code clerk assigned

to the American Embassy in Moscow in August 1960.

The woman

accompanied MORUNE on a train trip from loscow, became inti-

mate with him in Warsaw, returned to Moscow twice in February

1961, and there

had

sexual relations with him.

The compromising

scenes of MORONE and the Polish UB agent were

photographed.

This information

on the KGB operation

was received by CIA soon

after the wonan's second visit to Moscow.

on the basis of this

report, NORONE was interviewed and polygraphed in Oslo in May

1961, ard he was transferred to Lisbon from Moscow in August

1961.

NOSENKO gave a few details on the

same case, without men

tioning the name of the KGB target, during the

1962 meetings in

Geneva.

In 1964 and 1965 he furnished more particulars on

the

MORONE case, identifying three KGS agents (besides the Polish

female) who participated in the operation. NOSENKO, however,

said that two of them added no information of use to the KGB

against MORONE, and that he was unable to remember what the third

agent reported: statements by other sources indicate thai re-

garding MORONE

all three agents could have acquired information

of operational potential

for the KGy.

NOSENKO has not

reported,

as have other sources,

that. a fourth

KGB agent ramed Ella UMANETS

was in contact with MORONE, or that the KGB officer SHORTSOV.

posing as MICHAUD=-was with MORONE at America House on at least

one occasion, the night when STORSBERG says he was

approached

by the KGB (see above) • NOSENKO has confused the MORONE case

with another by saying

that a fifth KGB agent was directed

against MORONE, whereas she was apparently directed against the

American code clerk ZUJUS (see below).

The sensitive source of

the original report on MORCNE stated

that a KGB officer "VOLODYA"

-(Vladimir,

last name unknown) personally met the Polish female

agent when she arrived in Moscow, and NOSENKO said that the

officer was his subordinate KOSOLAPOV.

NOSENKO at first

claimed a KGB photographic technician supporting the case re-

ported to him, but he retracted this remark after CIA showed

him that travel records on NOSENKO made it impossible for the

technician to have spoken to him as he described.

According to

NOSENKO, MORONE was reassigned from Moscow before the KGB could.

take further steps against the code clerk, and he speculates

MORONE's transfer was prompted by American authorities'

concern

over his relationship with one of the KGB female agents.

(b)

NOSENKO's Information

At his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962 NOSENKO made

a passing reference to an operation in which he had placed a

female agent of the Polish

service in contact with an Anerican

from the Moscow Embassy while the latter was visiting Warsaw.

Later, NOSENKO said, he brought the same female to Moscow in

order

to obtain further compromising materials on this Anerican.

: 202.

Asked on Il June 1962 whether he had had foreign agents

working against the

U.S. Embassy, NOSENKO described his having

introduced the idea of using such agents to develop Americans.

afraid

of contacts with Russian girls. He said that he himself

had several of these third-national agents, that he sometimes

would ask

the German and Polish services to supply him with

agents,

and that it was unnecessary for him to explain their

interded use in operations against Americans:

NOSENKO then

gave an example:

"Listen, the sergcants (enlisted men) sho

The guard referred to is Frank BEGGS, a marine enlisted man

who accompanied MORONE to Warsaw.

The facts, however,

seem

to relate to MORONE, who has described his encounter with

the Polish girl and her subsequent recontact in Moscow.

BEGGS has also reported (see .below) that MORONE met a Polish

Jirl on the train to Warsaw and that she later contacted hin

in Moscow: BEGGS has denied that he himselt, was contacted

by any such girl in the Soviet Union after the trip to Warsaw

with MORONE.

1961, but the circumstances described by NOSENKO seem to

apply to those surrounding a relationship between a woman

named Lillian (last name not known) and the military code

clerk zuJUS.

These details are given in Past V.5.3.C.(v).

• In ankevent, the incident involving Lilliar occurred after

Although the KG3 had the compromising photography, it was

felt that there were

insufficient materials for a recruitment

approach

tO MOPONE.

The KGB warted to trap him in the apart

ment of a Soviet

koran,

to

catch him in something that is defi-

nitely prohibited.

For this purpose, Svetlana IVIOVA

(see

above)

was supposed to lure MORCiE into the city, but before

anything further could be done, the Americans ordered MORONE

out of Moscow before the end of his tour, possibly because they

were concerned about his association with IVANOVA. Therefore,

NOSENKO said, tre iG3 made no operational approach to MORONE

and no recruitnent of nim.

(c) Infortation from

sensitive Polish source reported in 1961 that on 8 Novem

ber 1960 a Polish ferale,

an experienced English-speaking agent

of the Polish UB,

arrived in

Moscow where she was met by a KGB

case officer named "VOLODYA."

She stayed at the hotel Warsaw

in Moscow.

The KGB case officer, apparently from the American

Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorute, on 10 November

1969 pointed MORONE out to this agent at a railroad station in

MOSCOW.

Under KGB insisuctions, the Folish female met MORONE

on

cne

train to warsaw, where intimacies began.

In Warsaw on

12 November 1960 she was quite friendly with Morolz, but pur

suant to instructions.

she refused all overtures to

engage in

intimacies.

The next

day she took MORONE to a Polish UB safe-

house suitably prepared

for clandestine photography, and reveal-

ing photographs of an intimate nature were

taken of MORONE

and herself.

The fenale agent again travelled to Moscow on

5 February 1961 and stayed at the Peking Hotel. Further com

promising photographs were taken of her and MOPONE on this

trip.

The female agent travelled to Moscow a third time and

on 12 and 13 February 1961 more photographs were taken of her

and MORONE.

GOLITSYN was questioned on the basis of this lead on

16 February 1962:

He was asked whether he was sure of his

He just cannot be in Moscon."

NOSENKO telephoned the Geneva safehouse on 2 February

"I don't remember having any face-to-face encounters

stated on 17 April 1964, "When he was being taken to the

d. NOSENKO's Reeponsibility Eor Coverage of ABIDIN

(1) Introduction

John V. ABIDIAN served as the U.S. Embassy Security Officer

in Moscow from 2 March

1960 until February 1962, approximately

the same period as NOSENKO's claimed gervice in the U.S. Embassy

Section of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate.

During his Moscow tour. ABIDIAN was coopted by CIA to perform a

number of operational tasks, including clandestine letter reilings

to several CIA agents inside the Soviet Urion and servicing a

dead drop to be used only for receiving two special types of

communications* from the source in the GRU, Colonel O.V. PENKOV-

SKIY®

During his 1962 meetings. with CIA, NOSENKO mentioned ABIDIAN

on several occasions,

identifying him as the Embassy Security

Officer and as a CIA officer.

In 1967 he described ASIDIAN'S

letter mat-ling activittes, and he said he was himself concerned

(zanimat' sya) with ABIDIAN.

After resontacting CiA in Geneva in

January 1964 NOSENKO divulged that he had been the KGS case

officer rusponsible for coverage of AbIDIA; in Moscow, for the

first time he described then a visit made by ABIDIl to the

PENKOVSKIY dead arop site.

The discussion below is divided into three parks:

NOSENKO'

case officer responsibilities and the information he

Learned

about ABIDIAN, NOSENKO'& knowledge of clandestine letter mailings

and NOSiNKO's statements on ABIDIAN and the Pushkin

Street dead drop.

(11) Duties as Case Officer

On 17 April 1964 when asked to describe his transfer from

the Jourist Department to the American Department in January

1960, NOSENKO said that when he reported for duty and was inter-

viewed by V. A. KLYPIN, Chief of the American Department, and

V.M. KOVSHUK, Chief of

the U.S. Embassy Section, he was told

that

as one of his duties he

would be the case officer in charge

Of ABIDIAN, whose arrival in Moscow was expected in the near

future.

NOSENKO was the only XGB officer responsible for cover

age of and activities against ABIDIAN and, NOSERKO said, ABIDIAN

was the only Arerican target for whom he, personally, was offl

cially accountable while in the U.S. Embassy Section.

NOSENKO was questioned in detail concerning ABIDIAN for

six days in January and February 1965.

He produced the infor-

mation in the following paragraphs at that time.

when NOSENKO began to work in the U.S. Embassy Section,

ABIDIAN had not yet arrived in Moscow.

The section, however.

already had received some information

on him, and this was given

to NOSENKO by KOVSHUK. Among this material was ABIDIAN' & ViSa

cation of his forthcoming absence from Moscow.

Moscow via contacts with the British Embassy and the

application, the negative

results of checks of KGB Headquarters

files, and a report prepared by the American. Department of the

First Chief Directorate®

ascording to this report.

based on

correspondence from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United

States, ABIDIAN had served as a Departmen: of State Security

Officer concerred with the personal safety of Premier KHRUSHCHEV

when he visited the United States in 1959:

from the way ABIDIAl

had acted at that time, the Legal Residences concluded he was an

intelligence officer, probably with CIA."

NOSENKO remarked that

the report, combined with the fact that ABIDIAN was replacing the

known

CIA officer Russell LAVCELLE as Security Officer, made

ABIDIAN one

of the most important counterirtelligence targets

of the U.S. Embassy Section and therefore of the entire Second

Chief Directorate.

NOSENKO personally opened the KGB file on ABIDIAN and later

assigned him the cryptonym "'ARSEN,

"since this cryptonym had been

used by personnel of the seventh (Surveillance) Directorate,

KGB- Second Chief Directorate, who were working against him.

NOSENKO was unsuccessful in his attempts to learn more about

the life and career of

ABIDIAN.

He visited the Chief of the

American Department of the KCB First Chlei Directorate, but this

unit had no information in acdition to that already included in

the original information report.

NOSENKO requested that the KGB

Legal Residencies

in the United

States be asked for further de-

tails;

but they were never received.

For these reasons, NOSENKO

said that he did not know and never

obtained details about ABID-

IAN's education and study abroad. date of entry into the Depart-

ment of State, promotions, personal rank. previous foreign assign-

ments, military service.

status as Foreign Service Reserve,

Staff

or Officer (FSR, FSS, FSO%,**

* CIA records indicate that ABIDIAN studied in Paris in 1949-50

and then secured employment with the Department of State as

a clerk/typist.

He remained in Paris Until 1954, After spe

cial training at the CIC schoes at Fort Holabird

and the

Secret Service School, ABIDIAN

served from 1956 until leaving

for Moscow in 1960

as a special

agent in the State Depart-

ment's Office of Security.

A iarge part of his work in this

period was arranging the security of

and accompanying foreign

dignitaries visiting the United States.

These included the

visits of Soviet Foreign Minister SHEPILOV in November 1956,

MIKOYAN in the spring of 1959, and KHRUSHCHEV at the end of

1959. These duties undoubtedly brought ABIDIAN into contact

with a large number of KGB officers stationed in New York and

Washington.

One of the members of the KHRUSHCHEV entourage

was KOSOLAPOV who, according to NOSENKO, joined the U.S.

Embassy Section in late 1959 and, as of January 1960, became

NOSENKO's subordinate in operations against American code

clerks.:

#*NOSENKO was unaware of the meaning of the initials FSR, FSS,

and FSO. When asked whether he

had checked the Department

of State Biographic Register for information on ABIDIAN'S

background, he replied that chis publication is not available

in: the U.S., Embassy Section. • He subsequently recalled that

the Chief of the Section; KOVSHUK, did have a copy dated:

about 1956, which was of no use in gathering information on

ABIDIAN..

Because: ABIDIAN was considered to be a CIA officer. he was

made

a. "special target" of surveillance from the date of his

arrival..

He was always under 24-hour surveiliance by it least

two and often three KGB teams.

so that at any hour a team was

available to cover him if he left the U.S. Embassy.

The only

time this intensity of covirage might have beer reduced, NOSENKO

said, was during a period of about one and one-bale months in

1961, wren surveillance of the Enbassy was gererally reduced in

order to allon increased coverage of

targets.*

As the

responsibie case officer, HuSENKO directed the surveiliance of

ABIDIAN ard evaluated the operational

possibilities offered by

arrival in Moscow, the decision was reach-

personal life, travel, education,

ABIDIAN also reported that on

about it because the foreign Legal Residencies of the KGB First

Chief Directorate would not accept a request for operational

action against an American diplomat coming from Moscow.

In February 1965 NOSENKO was asked a number of times

whether he knew of ary occasions on which heiDIAl took trips in

the soviet Urion outside of Moscow.

He replied each time that he

knew of no such trips and that 1f

ABIDIAN had made such a trip or

trips he would have known of them and would remember them as it

would have been his responsibility as case officer to take cer-

tain actions.

Among the latter he listed: •

itinerary and giving them instructions for surveillance and

other operational activity if desired.

- Recelving. reading, and filing all surveillance

reports and reports

of other operational activity carried

out by locak iGb units.

NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps.

He stated

further that even if he were absent when such

a request for travel

was made, he would have seen all documents upor. his return and

that he did not remember seeing such cocuments in ABIDIAN's file.

NOSENYO's interrogators then told NOSENKO that ABIDIAN

travelled out of Moscow from 5 to 9 October 1950.*

Thereupon

NOSENKO stated that he specifically recalled having been on leave

in October 1950.

He said that he could not resall exactly the

dates of this leave (which he had rot mentioned before), but he

did remember that he was away exactly 30 days since he stayed at

a dacha near Moscow and therefore was not allowed any travel

time.

NOSENKO said further that he also remenbered that he had

ABIDIAN made a trip with Paul A. SMITH, the Embassy's Publi-

cations Procurement Officer, to Armenia between 5 and 9 Octo-

ber 1960.

(ABIDIAN iS of Armeniar. origin, and speaks the

Armenian

language with a high degree of proficiency.) while

there ASIDIAN visited with various churchren and their

parishioners ard an Armenian who had repatriated from Greece

in 1946.

They attended a service in Echmiadzin celebrating

the anniversary of the accession of the Katolikos VAZGeN I.

and ABIDIAN also visited some relatives of his in or near

the city of Yerevan. After returning to Moscow, an Armenian.

whom ABIDIAN had met on this trip tried to contact ABIDIAN

at the Embassy: but ABIDIAN refused to see him.

When NOS-

ENKO was told

that on 7 October 1960 ASIDIAN attended a ser-

vice celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Armenian Kato-

likos, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO recalled that ABIDIAN. had gone to

Echmiadzin and

that an agent had reported a contact with him

ABIDIAN'S Servicing of the Pushkin Street Dead Dop

In 1964 NOSENKO told CIA for the firse time that KGB sur-

veillance had observed a visit by BIDIN to a probable dead

drop on Pushkin Street in Moscor a= the erd o$ 1960. This dead

drop figured prominently in the PErKOVSKIY case.

NOSENKO's first remarks on this subjece were made on 20 April

1964:

"I left Lthe U.S. Embassy Section' ir 1962.

There was an

interesting move.

This address where JACOES" was caught in the

PENKOVSKIY case - the same address was visited by ABIDIAN

in

At the be-

ginning I came there two or three cimss.

I came there with

MATVEYEV once, twice with KOVSIlUk; de came there with Venyanin

KOZLOV...

But no one appeared here and so they were not writing

anything meaning that the Surveillance Directorate was not sub-

mitting written reports/.

consistent with and somewhat more cetailed than earlier state-

ments not recorded here, is taken from these 1965 interroga-

tions:

• In 1951, while NOSENKO das the responsible case

officer, the KGB followed ABIDIAN from

the U.S.

Embassy

to a residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow.

A stationary

surveillance post at the Embassy saw ABIDIAN

leave with the Publications Procurement Officer of the

Embassy in a chauffeured autonobile, rather than in the

car he normally used.

The surveillance team assigned

speciflcally to ABIDIAN

thereupon followed the car to

a bookstore. Both Americans ertered the bookstore, but

shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone,

He walked arourd

the corner and

entered a residential building next to a

meat market on Pushkin Street.

ABIDIAN emerged after a

few seconds.

The surveillarce team saw him go in but did

not follow him.

This unusual incident was reported by

the surveillance team to the KGB Seventh (Surveillance)

Directorate, and the building was inspected that same day

by the Chief of the First Department of the Surveillance

Directorate, KOZLOV, together with the Deputy Chief of the

American Department of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

MATVEYEV.

Taking into account the character of the building

and its

inhabitants, the duration and circumstances of

ABIDIAN ' S

visit.

and the suitability of the hallway -

particularly the radiator in it - for use as a dead

drop

site,

it was decided by the leadership of the Second Chief

Directorate and the Surveillance Directorate that a station

ary surveillance post should immediately be set up to cover

this location. Because of the short time available, it was

not possible to place this post inside the building.

so it

was set up across the street.

In addition, the raciator

was checked daily to see if anything, such as a macnetic

container, had been concealed behind it.

This stationary

post was maintained

around the clock for 30 days,

after

which it was

maintained from 0800 until midnight

for another

two months.

If

a package or magnetic container had been

found behind the radiator, which was checked every morning,

it was planned to attach to it very thin wires to trigger

a signal should someone remoye the package.

At the sane

time a member of the surveillance team would be stationed

on the landing

of the staircase in this building, out of:

sight from the

hallway below.

During the three months

that the post was maintained, nothing was found concealed

behind the radiator, nor were any suspicious persong seen

entering or leaving

the building.

The post was then dis-

continued, but the

address was placeá on a list of sus-

picious places inspected daily by the Surveillance Direc-

corate.

The true significance of this location became

known to the KGB only later, after the arrest of PENKOV-

SKIY in 1962.

- NOSENKO first heard of ABIDIAN's visit to the sus-

pected dead drop

the day it occurred.. He was

sitting in KOVSHUK's office when he received a telephone

call from MATVEYEV telling him of the incident. Although

NOSENKO was ABIDIAN's case officer and KOVShUK was Chief

of the U.S. Embassy Section, the decision to place the

stationary surveillance post on this location was made at

a higher level; neither of them was involved in it or in

the later decision to discontinue the post.

self visited the building on Pushkin Street the following

day or the day after, but he remained only a few minutes

and did not recall any details of the hallway, except that

there was a radiator there.

- As ABIDIAN's case officer, NOSENKO recalled re-

ceiving the surveillance report of his visit to the

Pushkin Street building and placing this report in

ABIDIAN 's file.

(This is the case file which NOSENKO

turned over to his successor, CRYAZNOV, about 28-28 December

1961, just before he transferred to the Tourist Department.)

- NOSENKO received no written reports on the results

of the stationary surveillance post.

but he did discuss

this matter with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during

the first month of surveillance, periodically after that.

These discussions took place either by telephone.

or when

KOZLOV was visiting NOSENKO's office, or when NOSENKO

visited KOZLOV's office in KGB Headquarters.

From KOZLOV

or perhaps someone

else, NOSENKO learned that the post had

been discontinued after 90 days.

On the basis of these

conversations with KOZLOV, NUSENKO knew that nothing of

interest occurred during the period of the stationary sur-

veillance.

- NOSENKO was in the U.S. Embassy Section during all

the period that the stationary surveillance post was watch-

ing the Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard

from KOZLov that the post had been replaced by periodic

inspections.

- NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance

on the Pushkin Street dead

drop site to his CIA contacts

in Geneva in June 1962 because the post had already been

discontinued by this time without anything unusual or sus-

picious having been noted.

Therefore he thought that this

incident would not be particu aily interesting to the CIA.

CIA records show that ABIDIAN visited the Pushkin Street

dead

drop site only

once,

on 30 December 1961, a year later

than

NOSENKO sayS,

in response to an apparent signal from PENKOVSKIY.

The sequence of events was as follows:

On 27 December 1961,

following seccipt of what seemed to be the prearranged signal

from PENKOVSKIY that the drop had been loaded,

Air Force Captain

Alexis DAVISON drove from his apartment to the U.S. Embassy to

alert ABIDIAN. At about 2100 hours the same night. ABIDIAN

left in his own car for Spasso House, the Ambassador's residence

where a dance was in progress, to tell the CIA Chief of Station,

Paul GARELER, about the signal. ABIDIAN and GARBLER left Spasso

House with the other guests at about 0200 on 28 December in

ABIDIAN's car and drove past the telephone pole where, as part

of his "drop loaded" signal, PENKOVSKIY was to leave a mark.

Later in the morning of 28 December. ABIDIAN, again in his own

car drove from the Embassy to DE:IDSON's apartment, where he

first checked the telephone pole visually from the window and

then walked by it for a closer examination.

Although it was

not certain that the telephone calls received on 27 December

had, in fact, been a signal from PENKOVSKIY and although no

supplementary mark was found on the telephone pole, a decision

was reached to check the drop.

Therefore, at 1115

on 30 Decem-

ber 1961, ABIDIAN with Julian F. MacDONALD, an Embassy Economics

Officer®

left the Embassy in an official car with a Soviet

driver and proceeded to a bookstore on the corner of Pushkin

Street.

At 1130 ABIDIAN entered the building where the drop

Site was located, determined that the drop was empty, and

left one minute later..

The pair then returned to the Embassy®

These facts were outlined tp NOSENKO during the February

1965 interrogations..

recent account; NOSENKO had transferred from the U.S. Embassy

Section to the Tourist Department about 28 Decenber 1961 and

that his participation in a Tourist Department approach to

American citizen W. E. JOHNSON on 5 January 1962 had been con

firmed by JOHNSON himself:

Therefore. NOSEiKO was told, much

of what he had told CIA about his own role in the Pushkin

Street affair became untenable.

NOSENKO'S rESponsE to this

Observation is described

in Part V.F. 3., Which discusses

NOSENKO's approach to JOHNSON.

Also during the February 1965 interrogations NOSENKO refused

to sign the page

of a protocol which read as follows:

"I have been

told by my interrogators that AbIDIAN's

only visit to the Pushkin

Street site took place on 30 DeC-

ember 1961.

Therefore, I was told that:

a.

I could not have placed the surveillance

report in ABIDIAN's case file because I had already

turned over the file to GRYAZiOV.

b. I could not have received

reports about the

stationary surveillance wnile still ABIDIAN's case

officer.

since I was already in the Seventh Depart-

ment in January 1962.

The three month period in which the sur

veillance post was watching

the Pushkin Street

site

did not expire until 30 March 1962 - more then two

weeks after I left for feneva.

Thus I could not have known in June 1962 that the surveil

lance of the dead drop site had failed to produce results

or that it had been discontinued."

Although he acknowledged having reported to CIA on his involve-

ment with ABIDIAN as summarized in the protocol, NOSENKO said

the way in which the protocol was prepared made him "look silly."

On no other occasion has NOSENKO refused to sign protocols

dealing with other subjects.

NOSENKO was questioned further during October 1966 concern-

ing ABIDIAN's visit to-Pushkin Street. NOSENKO -eaffirmed that

ABIDIAN was under special surveillance coverage throughout his

Moscow tour and that this surveillance detected his travel from

the U.S. Embassy to Pushkin Street and back; he would date this

only as "sometime in 1961." NOSENKO was asked whether KGB sur-

veillance had detected any unugual movements by ARIDIAN during

the period just preceding his visit to the PENKOVSKIY drop

site (a reference to his movements on 27 and 28 December 1961

as described above). He replied that he knew definitely that

surveillance had reported nothing unusual and added that

ABIDIAN had not succeeded in losing the KGB surveillance at

any time during this period.

On 20 October 1966 NOSENKO was asked why. in his opinion,

gore to the dead drop site

on the day NOSENKO said he did.

the Pushkin Street dead drop

site was proposed by PENKOV-

SKIY himself in the August 1960 letter by which he initi

ally contacted CIA. The only known visits by Americans to

this address and the only ones connected with its use as a

dead drop location occurred on 12 November and 4 December

1960, when CIA officer Eugene MAHONEY checked the address

from the outside, and on 21 January 1961, when MAHONEY

returned and entered the building to check the precise

dead drop location.

only for the laval Attaches during early

1960.

He answered!

"I took the files only on the Navy,

but I was working on all of thes."

In other contexts NOSENKO has always equated custody

of a file with case officer responsibilities.

There-

approximately two months when these files were in his

name, he was officially the KGB case officer charged

with the Anerican Naval Attaches.

Knowledge of the Target

(1) Introduction

Hie position

and duties as seputy Chief and sonetimes

Acting Chief gave NOSENKO access to,

and required hin to

know, the extent of the U.S. Embassy Section's knowledge

of ita target.

He has therefore beon questioned at length

by CIA about the locations and occupents os the Embascy

offices as well as about the Embassy personnel whom the KGB

had identified as CIA officera.

The information from

NOSENKO on these two topics is presented below.

(11)

Physical Premises

NOSENKO has said that tie krowledgo of the physical

layout of the Embassy cerives boti from his gencial super-

visory function during 1960 and 1961 and fron nig respon

sibilities as the officially registerod sustodian of the

KGB'o file on the security of the Erbassy.

According to

NOSEIRO, he recelved the latter from his chief, korsio,

when he arrived in the section in January 1960; shortly

thereafter he arranged by a phore cail to the Secretariat

of the Second Chief Directorate to have custody transferred

officially to his name fron that of ME. BAKHVALOVe his

predecessor as Deputy Chief of Section,

NOSENKO explained

that BAKHVALOV had already left the soction by this time

but that, under KGB pIcce lures, it has permissile for an

officer to remin official custodian of a file belonging

to the U.S. Embassy Section, even after leaving the imerican

Department, so long as he remained

in the Second Chief

Directorate.

Until he turred this

file over to GRYAZNOV

approximately duriny the pariod 25 to 28 December 1961, no

one else had access to it other than KOVSHUt, Chief of

section, and GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPO!, who shared the office

and safe where this file was kept.

NOSENKO stated in February 1965 that he had never

studied the contents, nor had he paid any special attention

to this file.

he would necessarily

have been in a

position to know,

NOSENKO also said he is certain that no

operational analysis or

planning by himself or others was

done on the basis of this file during his two years in the

section.. The file consisted of two volumos, one for the old

building on Mokhovaya Street and the second--about one inch

thick--concerning the new Embassy building on Chaykovskiy

Street, which

was occupied in 1953. It was used only for

reference purposes, for the KGB had concluded that it was

impossible for a Soviet citizen to penetrate the secure

areas. of the Embassy because of the security precautions in

effect.

Apart from these file-custodial duties, NOSENKO was

generally interested in the floor plane of the Embassy.by

virtue of his position as Deputy Chief of the section.

NOSENKO's knowledge of the Embassy premises is reflected an

the CIA debriefing of February 1965, and these statements

were carefully. questioned on what they san, because these;

areas were of special interest to the Kus.

NOSENKO knew

no KGB employees who enterad tha secure areas during

1960 or 196i and had no personal contact with any of then.

Ke did not remember any information that such KGB erployees

ever reported to the KGB, except that Dmitriy I. KUKOLEV,

an electrician whom he personally handled in 1954-1955,

had observed antenna wiring in the attic, the details or

significance of the wiring were unknown to NOSENKO as of

1965.

NOSENKO personally paced some reports by KGB agents

in the Embassy security file while he had custody of 1t.

None o: the Information, he said, was interesting, in

portant, or useful enough for him to remember, and he

could not name the agent sources of the KGB.

In another

context and at another tine, however, NOSENKO said he

had received a report from some agent (name unknown)

that there was a sign

"Security difice" on the office

door of John V. ABIDIAN, the Embassy Security Officer.*

NOSENKO did not study the Enlassy security pio

cedures in detail and did not remerber where the classified

trash was burned.

He said that nothing could be done with

this information operationally, because

the tresh was al

ways burned by a U.S. sergoant of a Marine guard ac

companied by an officer."*

The Embassy office or floor where any section was

located or any

individual worked during the years 1960

and 1961 was not remerbered by NOSENKO. This reply was

also given when he was asked about the roons and floors

for the offices of the ambessador,

political officers,

ABIDIAN, and the code cleks,*** NOSENKO said that he

eithor knew these locations at the time he was Deputy

Chief of the section or could have found then in the

There never has been such a sign; NOSENKO's responsi

bility for the KGB coverage of ABIDIAN is discussed

in. Part V.E, 3.d.. All Soviets who enter the top three

floors of the Embassy have a marine escort.

* *

A check with two former Embassy security officers in

dicates that there has never been such a regulation.

The trash is burned by the marine on duty who "in-

variably does it alone."

One of the security officers

questioned said: "I can think of no reason why the sov.

lets would think this to be the case, since whatever

collateral information they have on it would point to

the truth."

In 1960 a "metallic chamber" (acoustical room) arrived

at the Embassy for President Eisenhower's use and for

secret conversations.

NOSINKO was not certain where it was

located or whether it was ever used, but he heard from an.

unknown source that in 1960-1961 meetings were held in &

secure roon in the "zone of Security."

He did not know any

of the technical detalls of this room.

The KGB accompliahed only one theft of classified

material in any form from the U.S. Embassy durirg 1960

and 1961. A charwoman (name or cryptonym not reralled)..

who worked as an agent for the KGB officer Viktor BELOG

LAZOV, stole a bag of papers from the office of the Naval

Attaches.

Most of the papers were turn or crumpled. They

Includod a draft of a report of the Naval Attaches sighting

of ships and factories while on a trip to Leningrad. Since

this report was of only routine intercat to the KGB, NOSENKO

said, he was unable to recall any othor details of the theft,

Including the date, except that the charwoman was granted

a cash award.

(211) CIA Personnel Under Embassy Cover

According to NOSENKO, the Americans at the U.S. Enbassy

of grantest counterintelligence interest to the KGB section

ware the identified CIA officers.

When questioned on

Septerber 1954 corcerning his knowledge of intelligence por

sonnel assigned to the Embassy in 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO

stated that the KGB immediately listed any officer associated

with the offices of U.S. Armed Forces Attaches as a member

of American Military Intelligence and any diplonat.as

"suspect

American Intelligence," the latter notation always

meaning

CIA.

one of the tasks of the section was to determine which

for Chier of station, which were CIA case officars, and

which were tho CIA agents or cooptees.

The KGB knew that

code clerks would not be used to fulfill intelligence misions

and that the sane probably held true for the Ambassador and

the Marine guards.

NOSENKO On 25 february 1965 signed a pIo

tocol which included his statenent that, as Deputy Chiet and

occasional Acting Chief of the section,

NOSENKO has been shown lists of the names of all

American personnel assigned to the embassy during 1960 and

1961 and on a number of occasions has been asked to select

those known or suspected by the KGB to be CIA officers.

George BLAKE, the KGB penecration of MI-6, was arrested

in London on 11 April 1961.

In his confession

he said that

he had passed the KGB a master list of the

names of persons

connected with the joint U.s. -British project with which

had been connected in Frankfurt, as well as other

materials on this project. On this basis,

was

relieved shortly thereafter of further duties

connected with

support of the PENKOVSKIY operation; he was withdrawn fron

Moscow in September 1961, less than a year after his arrival.

CIA records indicate that GARBLER was detailed to CIA

by the Navy in April 1952 and served

from January 1953 until July 1955. In the fall

01 1955, be resigned his naval commission, and in May 1956

On 3 June 196l, he returned to active duty with the Navy,

and on 31 August 1961 his appointment was announced as

Assistant Javal Attache to lescow, with the rank of Commander.

In September 1961 his official biographic data was forwarded

to the office of the Soviet Naval Attache in Washington, who

had requested this information, and the same month GARBLER

made an official call at the Soviet Embassy.

GARBLER arrived

in Moscow on 29 November 1961. He was the CIA Chief of

Station there.

Prior to his affiliation with CIA, GARBLER served in

Korea and there was acquainted with George BLAKE.

1960 GARBLER was a participant in joint CIAN! 6 discussions

in Washington on the question of tourist operations into

the Soviet Union (see Part V.D.8); BLAKE, who had access

to information on the agenda and participants for these talks,

daitted after his. arrest in 1961 that he had photographed

the minutes of this meeting and had passed them to his Soviet

handlers-

Electronie Operations Against the U.S. Embassy

(1) Introduction

NOSENKO had. three basic pleces of information on KGB

audio and other electronic operationg

against the U.S. Em-

bassy in loscow:

The preseace of microphones in the

chancery building, the absencé of audio-technical dovices

In the north wing of the Embassy, and the existence of a

bean which monitors and jans transnissions fron the Embassy.

These are discusced separately below.

Except for knowing

that a resonant cavity

(wireless) nicrophone had been found

in the American Ambassador's residence in 1953, NOSENKO

said he was unaware of audio

surveillance devices and tech-

niques (other than the chancery microphones) in use against

the Embassy, nor did he know of any material produced by

such

measures.

NOSENKO told CIA

on 14 Say 1964 that, to

the best of his knowledge, there were no wireless micro-

phones (i.e., carrier transmitters and radio transmitters)

in the Embassy,* His Information on KGB electronic opera-

to a meet the target dated mabalsy rectabe, Aerie when

he was Deputy Chief of the U.S. Enbassy

Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate, in 1960-1961 and

derives from his special responsibilities in this period;

from his 1953-1955 service in the American Department, NO-

SENKO said, he learned only that audio installations

existed.

(11) Microphones in the Chancery

Frequently described by NOSENKO as his most important

information, the microphones in the chancery building were

first mentioned by him during the 1962 neetings in Geneva.

In these and subsequent debrietings NOSENKO reported in de-

tail on the ways in which he acquired this information, on

the number and locations of the microphones, the quality of

reception, and the value of production.

the date when the microphones became operative, but pre-

sumed (in agreement with the KGB defector COLITSYN) that

they Were installed prior to 1953, when the chancery was oc

cupled by U.S. Government representatives.**

microphones listed by NOSENKO, he has stressed the impor

tance of the one in the office of the Minister Counsellor,

the existence of which was earlier reported by GOLITSYN and

subsequently confirmed by technical investigations.

1962 NOSENKO said that the audibility of the nine-year-old

#NOSENKO stated that the KGB knew the identity of American

counter-audio technicians and therefore turned off the micro

phones whenever any of them arrived at the Embassy.

Since

a microphone-and-wire system cannot be turned off,

this re-

mark suggests either that there was an external power source

for the microphones, which NOSENKO has not mentioned, or

that NOSENKO himself did not have rodimentary knowledge of

wuch matters.

system

varied from very clear to zero; he said in 1964

that the quality was deteriorating and that "in & year or

two they the microphones) will be coupletoly inoperative. "

Althougt the microphones

produced a great deal of politi

cal intelligence, NOSENKO said, he found nothing worthwhile

for use against U.S. code clerks or others o? operational

interest to him.**

All pertinent details from NOSENKO and

other sources on the microphone system in the chancery

büilding is presented in the foli wing portions of this

paper.

(a) NOSENKO ' 5

Sources

Nearly all of NOSENKO's knowledge about the microphone

system in the chancery building

waS,

he said, derived from

two circumstances:

Fitst,

his responsibility as Deputy

Chief of the KGB's U.S. Embassy Section, for receiving and

disseminating transcripts. of conversations there; and

second,

a spectal neeting which he attended in his dual capacity

Deputy Chief of the U.S.

Embassy Section and custodian of"s

the microphone information.

Additional inforzation was ob

tained by NOSENKO in 1962 and 1963 from G.I. GRYAZNOV, his

former subordinate and his successor as Deputy Chief of the

Section.

In

several discussions with GRYAZNOV duting this

period NOSENKO learned that some of the microphones were

dead while others had become less efficient since NOSENKO's

reassignment to the Tourist Departsent in January 1962.

NOSENKO's statements concerning his major sources óf infor

mation on the microphones are presented in chronological

order below.

"We are listening to everything the military attaches

say in Moscow, the Military, Navy

and Air Force Attaches,"

NOSENKO said

on 11 June 1962.

"All the reports go through

me.

I read them....Only a limited group of people read

these reports.

They are all in the First Department of the

Second Chief Directorate.

Who are they?

The Chief of the

Department (we don't give them to his deputies), the Chief

of the [U.S. Embassyl Section, and I--altogether three people.

Sometines

we report to GRIBANOV things

we consider important.

We conceal the

fact that we are listening to the Americans

from our workers in other departments, from the English

Department,

fron the French Department... We are listening

to the three attaches and the Minister Counsellor.

Don't

even send coded cables abbut me (to Moscow).

If you do it

will be the end of me....Only three people krow that we

are listening

to you.

Even within the Second Chief Directo

rate it is a tremendous secret that we are listening. to you."

NOSENKO was asked on 12 June 1962 about the form in which

he received the audio intercept reports and whether these

reports were delivered to his office:

He answered:

"No:

Here's how it is done. We have a special unit concerned

It is a part

The Special Department has several

sections

within it.

Colonel (N.Ya.) KUZMIN.

He has the entire English line;

They collected it.

I signed a receipt that I had

received it from them and they gave me a receipt when I

returned it.

And then

they gave me extracts.

Fron these

. extracts alcne one cannot tell where the naterial cane from,

but from the report one realizes that the Americans are

being listened to.

It is necessary to have these extracts

to place in the files.

We have a file on each person working

in the Embassy, the so-called delo-formular (developmental

filel. We keep

one on every Embassy employee."

During the second of the 1964 series of meetings in

Geneva,

on

24 January, NOSENKO took a number of notes fron

his wallet.

Pointing to. one of them, he said:

"This piece

of paper was kept in my operational file and it represents

the statistics for the years 1960-1961,

listing those micro-

phones which are actively used in monitoring conversations

in the U.S. Embassy."

This list named eleven offices aud

apartments in the chancery which contained microphones.

When asked whether he had copied the list from records

had drawn it up from memory,

NOSENKO explained that it came

from an operational review of what "listening points we had

in the U.S. Embassy."

A detailed explanation of his acquisition of the written

list was supplied by NOSENKO on 14 May 1964:

Question:

How did this list come into your hands? What

caused you to write it?

NOSENKO:

Question:

I came to KLYPIN (Chief of the American Depart

ment] with my working notebook. KOVSHUK (Chief

of-the U.S. Embassy Section in the Department)

was writing and he put the list on my book.

KOVSHUK said this one (microphone]

is working

well, this one badly, and so on.

What was the date of this? What year and month?

NOS ENKO:

Oh, I don't remember, 1960... aybe the beginning

of

1961.

Question:

•At the end of 1960 or the beginning of 1961

you and KOVSHUK net in KLYPIN's office?

251•

NOSENKO:

Yes... Or maybe it was at a meeting.

It te dif-

ficult to say.

Maybe we

went to report to KOVSHUk

in his roon or maybe KOVSHUK was writing in

KLYrI's study room.

I don't remember.

NOSENKO then described the purpose of the seeting::

To dis

cuss the possibility of releasing monitor positions from

some of the

chancery aicrophones and of assigning these re

leased positions to Vladimir [patronymic unknowr] PETROV,-

Chief of the American Department's section for work against

American tourists and delegates suspected of being con

nected with American Intelligence; PETROY had earlier re-

quested English-language monitoring positions from the Chief

of the English-Language Section of the OTU's Second Special

Department but had been told that all such interpreters were

already engaged on priority targets.

At the meeting KOVSHUK

aid KLYPIN reviewed the microphone coverage of the chancery

to decide which rooms offered information of little value

and which monitoring

positions could be released to PETROV.

KOYSHUK drew up a list of

Embassy offices and apartments

then being covered on a full-time basis and indicated those

of lesser inportance.

At the end of the neeting, KOVSHUK

gave the list to NOSENKO, who retained it in his safe until

bringing it to CIA in 1964.

NOSEYKD has added nothing fur

ther

on the locations of microphones in the chancery building,

and nuch of his information concerning the quality and value

of the production by these microphones came from this

mccling.

Since his defection, NOSENKO has spoken further on his

responsibilities in coonection with the daily transcripts

received from the Second Special Department.

He said on

14 May 1964:

"All the materials after they were read and

signed were

returned to the Second (Special Department of the

Operational Tochnical Directorate.

Some of the material fron

this was put in the individual file, but anyone who read

It would never know where it came from.

He wouldn't know

that it came from mikes....KOVSHUK and I read all of this.

From this we gave information

to those

who needed it, de-

pending on their interest.

If there was something inter-

esting,

It was given to KLYPIN to read.

If KLYPIN

saw

something intcresting he could take it 'and give it to GRI-

BANOV.

Tatyana GRISHNYAT (from the Second Special Department)

came by car with this material. Sbe went to KLYPIN. Some

times she left them with me."

A protocol signed by NOSENKO in 1965 states:

"One of

my duties as Deputy Chief, First Section, First Department,

Second Chief Directorate, was to receive, review, and give

to appropriate case officers the production from micropiones:

In the American Embassy on a dally basis.

I also maintained

the control book (journal) for these trarscripts.

transcripts were prepared by the Operational Technical Direc

torate of the KGB.

Every day a female worker of the OTU

brought me the transcripts of conversations in the Embassy

from the previous day.

I regularly returned all of the ori

Bionl transcripts to this female worker; they were usually

He said that there was

discussion during 1960 and 1961 of using the KCB agents

employed there

to place temporary

audio devices for one or

two days at a time in the rooms of the Americans as well as

in the Embassy garage.

These plans were vetoed, however, be-

cause

such

devices are too easily found.

For the same rea

son, NOSENKO said,

there

was no attempt rade in this period

to place temporary devices in Spasso House (the Ambassador'g

residence) or in the apartments of such Embassy officers

as John

ABIDIAN.

The KGB was "afraid that they vill be

The microphones

were behind radiators.

The microphons system discovered

covered every outside room on floors six through ten, with

the exception of those offices with doors entering

on to

balconies and when exterior bullding constructions

were ad-

jacent to outside wall sections bearing radiators."

The first nicrophone found was in Room 1008, in what

1s now the Army Finance office and which in 1950-1961 was

the office of the Military Attache, where NOSENKO reported

a microphone to be.

All other microphones were ultimately

traced fron this discovery.

There were microphones in all

rooms identified by NOSENKO, and in others besides.

the latter were inoperative when found--ore in t e ambassa-

dor's office where NOSENKO said no conversations were being

heard

in 1960-1961 and

the other in the Security Office where

that all the microptones

were installed before the u.s.

( Summing. up)

"To be perfectly frank, I would

some of our

assure that...some of our modus operand'our personal

targets, some of the results,

and all of

weaknesses were compronised.

This is not a very de-

finite answer; bowever, it is the best estimate I can

make."

In 1ts general introduction, the USIB damago report

states:

"Although

there

has been no observable indication

that the Soviets have acted in any manner to the detriment

of the United

States based. upon Information considered pos

sibly. comprouised, it must

be concluded that due to the ox

tensive period of

penetration, the cumulative effect has

resulted in serious damage to the United States.

"The

Soviets have gained considerable knowledge as to the effective-

ness of United

States operations within the, Soviet. Union,

particularly

the military attache collection progran.

Soviet knowledge of U.S. emphasis upon certain intelligence

collection areas has made it possible for then to identify

priority intelligence and probable Soviet targets and thereby

permitted them

to implement specific counteractions..

The

Soviets over the years must have

amassed considerable infor

mation concerning the personal habits, problens, attitudes

and weaknesses of personnel assigned to the Embassy which

can be used by them for purposes of exploitation at any

time of their choosing in the future."

The following extract from the USIB damage report con

corns the declining value of the production from the micro

phones in 1962 and 1963.*

"The

security practices and procedures appear to

have followed a pattern from April 1953 to May 1960, at

which time the first plastic room was installed.. A

change occurred in the work habits in that the nore

senior State Department officers utilized the plastic

room for sensitive discussions and dictation.

The

room could accommodate only a limited portion of the

Embassy classified discussions and accordingly, a number

of classified discussions were held outside this secure

areB.

In the April 1953-lay 1960 period it was an ac

cepted practice for the Ambassador and the Deputy

Chief of Mission to discuss openly in their offices

routine classified operations of the Embassy and to

dictate classified documents and telegrams....In Sep-

tember 1962, the second acoustic room was erected for

the typing section for the handling of sensitive classi

fled material. From December 1963 to date

it was indi

cated that no classified telegrams have been dictated

*As previously indicated, NOSENKO said that in 1962 and 1963

he learned thare was alnost no production from the labassy

microphones.

One reason was the natural decline in effi

clency of equipment installed ten years previously; the KGB

belleved that other reasons were

the installation of

coustic rooms in the Embassy and tightened security pro

outside of the acoustic rooms. The military attaches

reported that most cables were drafted in longhand or

typed by the originator and then turned over to the

code clerks for transmission.

In certain instarces

cables were dictated in

the offices.

There were nany

discussiong in the offices relating

to official duties,

office routine, proposed travel, personal observations

and normal office talk not specifically in themselves

considered classified.

From 1953 to 1959, sensitive

classified matters

were discussed in whispers or to the

accompaniment of external noises, such as radios and

street noises.... In 1959 a secure

inner room was con

structed in the attache section and has since been

utilized for classified

discussions and debriefings...•

After being told by CIA on 31 January 1965. that a lead

No extensive counter-audio checks have yet been cerried

Investigation of tho

microphones ia the main section of the labassy led, however

to the discovery of other Soviet technicel equipment instalfed

in the north wing.

The USIB damage report stated:

"Three -

coaxial cables were discovered running parallel to the one

hundred-and-one pair audio cable from the North Annex roof

ares to the basement of the North Annex... (All three cables

were severed by

American technicians in 1964. The cable

runs

were as follows:

of the 20-pali and of the 30 pair cable which in turn

The second coaxial cable...followed the same path

as the first coaxial cable.

The shield was unterminated.

The center conductor was terminated in an insulated

metal grill.

The grill is located in the upper crust

of the North Anner attic floor with the long dimension

in Juxtaposition to the old common wall between the

Chancery and the North Annex.

The long dimension is

normal to the street in front of the Embassy.

The

grill is made of one centineter steel reinforcing rods

spot welded into a mesh of 15 cm. (j.9 inches)

The

overall dimensions of the grill are 14'4" by 4'7".

The coaxial cable was connected to one corner of the

The third coaxial cable ran along the approxinate

Yes, there 1s

NOSENKO:

Because NOSENKO's true name and photographs had been submitted

to the u.s.

NOSENKO added, it was henceforth

neceggary for him to use his

true name for all travel abroad.

c. The Cuba TDY (1960)

In November 1960, after and as

result of the cancellation

of his planned trip to

the United States, NOSENKC travelled

a delegation of nickel industry experts to cuba.

In the final minutes of NOSENKO's last meeting with CIA in

the subject of his trip to Cuba came up again; NOSENKO re-

called that he had used the name NOSENKO for his trip to Cuba

and that his function there was that of security officer.

Question: When did you travel to Cuba?

NOSENKO:

1960, November and December 1960.

Question:

Under the name NIKOLAYEV?

NOSENKO :

No, as NOSENKO, NOSENKO, NOSENKO.

from Gosplan,

submitted for coordination and, in particular, my

name had been given to the American

(Moscow]. But the American Embassy announced that

this delegation could be accepted, but a little

later.

And my passport had already been iggued.

My passport had already been signed authorizing travel

abroad,

but it was a service passport, not a diplomatic

one. And at this moment a delegation was supposed to

they

were lazy buns.

They would go to a lesson once and then

miss the next two and then perhaps go again, and again miss one

or two."

In september 1964 NOSENKO added that LEVINA had never

been targetted ayainst any particular individual and had never

provided any interesting reports on her Aperican contacts.. At

the end of 1960 or in the beginning of 1961, NOSENHO said, she

was released from the Embassy by Paul SMITH, possibly because

she was a little deaf and one had to epeak loudly to her to ce

understood.*

NOSENKO turned LEVINA over to another officer be-

fore he returned to the Tourist Department, and later the Eritish

Department was planning to use her in either the British or Carad

ian Embassies.

CIA records show that LEVINA was employed at the Embassy as

a librarian from January 1958 through January 1962, when she

vas released.

Paul SMITH was Second Secretary of the Embassy

In charge of the Cultural Affairs Section and Publications

Procurement Officer from May 1959 until approximately Septem

ber 1961, when he left Moscow.

Overseas Assignments

a. Attempt to Obtain Assignment in Ethiopia (1960)

During the first half of 1960, NOSENKO said, he applied for

a permanent overseas assignment to Ethiopia because doctors had

prescribed a change of climate for his daughter Oksana's asthma.

O.M. GRIBANQV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, approved

his request, but then the KGB Personnel Department turned

down when a

file review revealed

potentially dangerous character

weaknegses.

NOSENKO described this matter on 14 April 1964 as follows:

"Gennadiy GRYAZNOV came to the American Department of the Second

• Before 1956 he was studying in the

Higher School of the KGB

and when he finished the school in 1956

he was assigned to the KGB Personnel Department, and then he came

to the American Department in 1958.

SO GRYAZNOV had very good

cornections in the Personnel Depariment.

So in 1960, when I

wanted to leave, to go abroad on permanent assignment I said to

GRIBANOV:

'Let

me go for two years to Ethiopia.'

When the Par-

sonnel Department refused to let me go, I decided I'd just have

to know what was there in my personal

file.

I had to learr. what

it was that was causing all this.

By that time GRYAZNOV was in

the American Department of the Second Chief Directorate and hap

pened to be the head of the Party Organization of the entire

directorate, and he at che time

had worked in the Personnel Office:

himself.

He said:

'Give me this thing and I'll see what I can

find out about it.' So he went to the Personnel Department and

through his friend there got my personal file.

Ther. he gave me

a call

and said to come over.

I went to his office and he locked

the door.

Of course, he couldn't give me this file, couldn't

let me hold it in my

hands so to speak.

So he read this case

to me, this 1954 case to

me, about the

woman and so forth,* and

then said that at that time they made an investigation of

Inly

previous residence.

And they found out that while I was study-

ing at the Irstitute (of International Affairs] and was living

on Pervaya Meschanskaya Street, all sorts of girls visited me:

different girls,

new girl would visit me almost every week.

This was in my file.

Then

this case that took place in 1954.

And then in 1960--and, incidentally,

GRIBANOV mentioned this

to

me also-the file said

that I was drinking quite a bit,

and for

this reason I had many

fights with my wife.

And that was all

that appeared in my file.

Nothing else, whatsoever, besides

these things that I just mentioned."

D. U.S. Visa Application (1960)

NOSENKO's true name appeared with 11 others on a 20 October

1960 request to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for visas for menbers

of a Soviet automotive exchange delegation which was scheduled

to visit the United States in mid-November 1960.* HOSENKO wag

listed as an engireer employed by the Stato Scientific Technical

Committee (GNTK). After defecting, NOSENKO told CIA that he had

been scheduled to accompany

this delegation as a security offi-

cer but that the delegatior's visit to the linited States had

been postponed

at the last moment.

He therefore did not travel

to this country.

He further explaired, on 17 April 1964, why his visa appli-

cation had been submitted

in tzue name and

under a different

cover:

*In 1957 and 1958 I went to London as NIKOLAYEV repIE-

senting the Ministry

of culture.

Then in 1953 I didn't go anj-

where.

Then when this question came up of my going

to the Stateg

in 1960, I said: 'I'n rot

going.

I've been grina under tha

Ministry of Culture (cover! and with sports delegations.

This

has to be changed somelio: at this point.

So we thought about

it and finally sonebody said:.

how about this?

Perhaps

you can usel this comnittee cE RubNeV's (GNix)."

So I said:

'Weil,

it's up to you.

You ducide.' by that time my passport

sas ready, but the inericans and the soviets hain't come to ar.

agreenent yet.

It was decided that this celegation would go to

the U.S. in 1961."

NOSENKO was then asted why he could not

have used the NIKOLAYE name for his trip to

the United States.

He replied:

"Sure, I could have gone as NIFOlAYEV, but I just

didn't want to.

Pecause, look, it was kront to us that the

British and American Intelligence exchange information on people

they suspect of being iGi, and that the britisi,

of course,

had probably watched me when i was in England lin 1957 and

19581

and probably there it was noticed that here's this man

under

the cover of Ministry of Culture.

He's not a sportsman.

It

kind of looks suspicious.

Then he goes to the soviet Embassy.

Also suspicious.

So then I have to go to the States.

And if

I go as NIKOLAYEV I couldn't use--in that case I couldn't uge

the same cover of Ministry of Culture because of the type of

the delegation.

I'd have to use a different cover.

so I'd go

there and

they'd say:

'Aha, here's NIKOLAYEV under different

cover now."

But if I go as NOSENKO, the British nevor heard

the nare.

Nobody knows the name.

Everything would be O.k.

NOSENKO was then asked why he could not have travelled under

some

other alias.

Ho answered:

"That's the way it was de-

cided.

I guess

so as not to get all mixed up they decided to

send me as jOSEINO anyway. It's up to the people who are in

charge of these operations. They are the ones who decide."**

This visa

application was submitted approximately six months

after the

KGB rejected his request for PCS assignment to

Ethiopia.

** With regard to his trips to England in 1957 and 1958, NOSENKO

said that he had been forced to use the name NIKCLAYEV because

this was the name he had used with British citizens the

All of NOSENKO's accounts since contacting CIA in 1964 have

been generally consistent with that given on 14 June

story has beer as follows:

In the latter part of 1960, at the

time as he was preparing for his intended trip to the

celegation

of nickel industry experts

from Gosplan, the Soviet State Planning

Conmission, was prepar

ing for departure to Cuba.

The delegation was a routine one,

consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of the

Soviet Union, and since there was no one under any sort of sus-

picion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abicad) Department of

the Second Chief Directorate had decided that it would not be

necessary to include a security officer.

Two days prior to the

departure of the group, however, the Central Committee of the

Communist Party decided that a Second Chief Directorate case

officer must

go along.

Because of the short time remaining be-

fore the scheduled departure of the delegation, the Eleventh

Department protested that it would be impossible to find a suit-

able person and

the necessary papers ready in time.

this point, A.I. KUZNETSOV of the Eleventh Department said:

The Bulgaria TDY ard the LUNT Case

In the spring of 1961; four months after returning from

Cuba, NOSENKO was sent on

temporary assignment for about a

month to sofia, the only trip he took in other than a security

watchdog" capacity.

According to NOSENKO, it happened this

way:

"I think I first heard that I was going to Bulgaria, a

week or so before I left, from S.I. YEGOROY,

Chief of the

section having contact with the counterintelligence representa

He said:

'You must go to Bulgaria.

GRIBANOV has decided.'

He asked,

'DO YOU

know about this?' and I said

"No."

said:

'KLYPIN (Chief of the American Department) must tell you.'

But

this was the first I had heard about it.

YEGOROV said that the

Minister of the Bulgarian MVR had requested the Chairman of the

KGB

send

an officer from the American Department of the Sec

ond Chief Directorate to Bulgaria for consultation with the

-American Department, Second

Directorate of the MVR of Bulgaria..

After one or two days kLipI! told me about it.

He repeated

weeks I flew to

The discussion continued as follows:

Question: What plans were made for this trip in Moscow before

you left?

What briefings or discussions were held

concerning what you were to do in Scia?

NOSENKO:

I was told:

"You are goirg for consultations. There

They will discuss it with

you."

No one was speaking with me about my trip.

Question: What discussions did you have with your department

chief, KLYPIN, about what you were to do on this

trip?

NOSENKO:

Nothing.

He told me: "You will go. You will see

what they are doing.

You will tell them how to

work."

Question: Did you have any meetings or discussions with the

representatives of the Bulgarian MVR in Moscow be

fore you left?

NOSENKO: NO.

Question: What discussions did you have with YEGOROV of his

section about what you were going to do in Sofia?

NOSENKO:

YEGOROV said:

"You will go. You will tell us what

they are doing."

Question: Before you left Moscow for Sofia did you know any-

thing about the size of the American Department of

the Bulgarian MVR?

NOSENKO :

No. Nothing•

NOSENKO: No.

NOSENKO:

NOSENKO flew from Moscow in early April 1961

and was met

at the airport in Sofia by A.S. KOZLOV, a former Second Chief

Directorate officer whom he had known in Moscow.*

The follot.

ing morning he was picked up in an official vehicle and wee

taken to KOZLOV's office in the Bulgarian MVR building, not far

away.

NOSENKO asked KOZLOV what was expected of him and was

told that "they want to know about how

to work against the Ameri-

can Legation.

He said he wanted me

duced to the Chief KGB advisor in Sofia, Mikhail YEGOROV, and

to the Chief of the MVR's American Department, after which he

was assigned an office in the MVR builüing.

During the enguing

weeks he discussed both general matters and particular cases

with individual Bulgarian officers vorking aguinst the imerican

target.

On one occasion he lectured interested MVR officers

on the principles of operations against foreign military person-

nel in Moscow, and on another he visited an MVR surveillance

post opposite

the American Legation.

He discussed. KGB methods

of operations agains foreign tourists.

He also addressed the

entire American Department for about five hours and told them

"what is necessary, what to pay attention to, how to work."

At the end

of his visit, some

time in mid-May, NOSENKO conferred

with the First D-puty Minister of the MVR about what had been

accomplished and his recommendations for improving operations

against Americans.

As an outgrowth of his TDY to Bulgaria, NOSENKO has prO-

wided one lead to a case in which he said he took persona. part.

About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around

the end of

April 1961, NOSENKO was going over lists

of foreigners who were

scheduled to visit Bulgaria in the near future,

and he came

across the name Horace G. LUNT. NOSENKO recalled that a man

named LINT who was a Slavic linguist had been reported to him

in 1958 or 1959 by one of his homosexual agents, VOLKOV OI

YEFREMOV, as a possible homosexual.

He asked the Bulgarians

whether this man was a specialist in Slavic languages.

When

the Bulgarian officers replied in the affirmative, NOSENKO de

cided to check his recollection against KGB records and an

immediate phone call was placed to Moscow, asking for traces.

NOSENKO had earTier reported that YOZLOV had served as the

Chief of the American Department, Second Chief Directorate,

until 1953 and that, until about two years before going to

Bulgaria as a counterintelligence advisor, he had been

Deputy Chief of the Tourist Department.

For the two years

immediately prior to his Bulgarian assignment, he had been

Secretary of the Party Organization of the Second Chief

Directorate and was relieved of all other duties. Asked

why KOZLOV was unable to "advise" the Bulgarians in this

Instance, NOSENKO said that he was too busy advising on

higher levels and that he had been away fron the work for

a number of years.

NOSENRO told CIA that

the KGE had never done anything with its knowledge of LUNT'g

homosexual proclivities and that the Bulgarian MVR had not pre-

viously known of then.

NOSENKO's description of what happened next is as follows:

According. to Professor LUNT, the approach actually took

5. Transfer to the Tourist Department in January 1962.

In

the autumn of 1961 a decision was reached, on the basis

of NOSENKO's own request, to return him to the Tourist Depart

ment.

GRIDANOV had originally wanted to promote NoSenko fron

the position of Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section to the

post of Deputy Chief of the American Department; NOSENKO's

superior and friend KOVSHUK had long had his eye on this job,

however, and was the personal choice of the Chief of the Ameri

can Department for it.

(In fact; NOSENKO said, KOVSHUK had

once held the job, lcsing it in 1959 because of some misbehavior.)

NOSENKO did not want to be placed in the difficult situation

which his on promotion to this post would have created.

NOSENKO

• described his

transfer in the February 1965 interrogationg. The

following is from a protocol signed on 26 February 1965:

"The decision for me to return to the Seventh (Tourist)

Departrert. in January 1962 was actually made in about Septem

ber or october 1y6d.

GRIBANOV planned to appoint me Deputy

chief of the First (American) Department, but the new Chief

of the First Department, FELOSEYEV, wanted KOVSHUK to take

this position.

Since I did not want to be placed in this

position by GRIBANOV's order against the wishes of FIDOSEYEV,

I want to GRIBANOV and requested that I be transferred back

to the Seventh Department, in any position.

ment in late 1961 or for appointing me Section Chief and

did not discuss witi me my personal qualifications for.

each of these positions."

Aware of his impending transfer NOSENKO took the opportunity

during December 1961 to spend several hours each day in the Tour-

ist Department.

familiarized himself with certain files of the American Tourist

Section, and discussed current operations and operational possi

bilities with the officers assigned to this section. The formal

order for the transfer was signed by GRIBANOV on 24 or 25 Desem

ber 1961 and NOSENKO officially signed over the ABIDIAN case file

and the U.&. Embassy security file to his successor as Deputy

Chief of the American Erbassy Section, G.I. GRYAZNOV, within the

next few days.*

As he had when he transferred from the Tourist

to the American Department in 1960, NOSENKO said, he took his

active agents and his safehouse on

Vorovskiy Street with him when

he turned to the Tourist Department in 1962.

These specific dates were arrived at under interrogation in

February 1965.

On all earlier occasions NOSENKO had said

that he was transferred in January 1962 (or some later date):

he said in. February 1965 that he was "officially" transferred

at the end of December and reported to his new position at

the beginning of January (see below).

Date of Transfer

NOSENKO has given different dates for the time when he left

the U.S. Embassy Section of the American Departmert to become

Chief of the American-British-Canadian Section of the Tourist

Department.

During the Geneva meetings of 1962 he said on

different occasions that this occurred in January 1962 and

in

February 1962; in 1964 he timed the transfer as falling between

15 and 20 January 1962; and in February 1965 NOSENKO gave the

date as 2 or 3 canuary 1962.

He has also reported that he was

in the U.S. Embassy Section for three months after John ABIDIAN

serviced

the Pushkin Street dead drop (on 30 December 1961, thus

placing NOSENKO in the U.S.

Embassy Section until late March

1962) and that he had transferred to the Tourist Department by

the time GOLITSYN defected (which NOSENKO placed

in mid-January

1962 but which actually occurred in mid-December 1961).* W.E.

JOHNSON, the target of a Tourist Department operation**

con-

firmed that NOSENKO approached him in Moscow on 5 january 1962.

In Fabruary 1965 NOSENKO said he recalled that the correct

date

of his approach to JOHNSON was on 5 January 1962.

The CIA

interviewer then reminded NOSENKO that he had earlier described

on several occasions his visit to the dead drop site or Pushkin

Street and his receipt of reports from the surveillance

post

for three months afterwards; during all of this period, NOSENKO

had said, he was in the U.S. Embassy Section of the First Depart

ment.

NOSENKO was told that CIA records show that ABIDIAN made

only one visit to this dead drop site, on 30 December 1961.

days before the approach to JOHNSON.

He answered only that he

might have been confused,

but despite any contradictions the

lation of dates.

Functions and Activities

As Chief of the Anerican-British-Canadian Section of the

Tourist Department (hereafter in Part V.F. referred to as the

American Tourist Section) from January to July 1962, NOSENKO

said, he was responsible for planning and coordinating all

KGB activities against such tourists in the USSR as well as

for supervising the operational work of 15 subordinate case

officers.

He had no deputy.

NOSENKO told CIA that he required

several months at the beginning of 1962 "to get the feel of

things", "there were no accomplishments" on his part in the

initial period on this new job, and plans for handling the

influx of American tourists during the forthcoming 1962 season

consisted of studying files and continuing to work against the

tourists as in the past. NOSENKO was asked in February 1965 -

Finally,

NOSENKO said he participated in the

NOSENKO has indicated that his own operational work in 1962

to 1964 was limited to those cases cited above because of the

considerable anount of time spent on temporary duty assignments

outside Moscow during these two years.

In mid-February 1962,

soon after assuming the duties of Chief of the ATerican Tourist

Section, he began to prepare for his first trip to Geneva, which

These included a two

secret documents to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow (see

Part VI.D.7.C.).

3. NOSENKO's Agents

When NOSENKO returned to the Tourist Department in the

first days of 1962, he took with him the agents whom he had

been handling as Deputy Chief of the U.S. Embassy Section.

These agents are listed below with a summary of NOSENKO'S COm-

ments concerning their use in 1962 and 1963.*

Describing FRIPPEL'S

past service for the KGB on 15 June 1962, five months after he

said he transferred to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO said:

"FRIPPEL was afraid and gave practically nothing.••

He was

a weak agent...

I recruited him but. speaking honestly, he

was not an agent." Nevertheless, NOSENKO said, the KGB hoped

that FRIPPEL would be reassigned to the USSR at some future

When FRIPPEL returned twice to the Soviet Union in

Marina RYTOVA was turned over to NOSENKO by I.A. KONSTAN-

TINOV of the Tourist Department in 1956 or 1957.

At that time

she was working as an interpreter at the Russian. Permanent

Exhibition in Moscow. In 1960 or 1961 she. became an instructor

of the Greek language at the Institute of International Relations,

and some time in 1962 she got a job at the school of the Central

Conmittee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

she ceased all

NOSENKO first referred to his approach to the American

tourist Wallace Everett JOHNSON on 11 June 1552. He did not name

JOHNSON at this time:

NOSINKO'3 first reference to JCINSON in 1964 was at a meet -

on 2 February, when he produced a note bearing that name and

the

date 5 January 1962.

"Here I have a rame jotted down,

"The date wes

lectior.

I don't think it was a

recruitment, but it

was some

sort of contact, or he was being studied or worked on, or some-

thing like that.

But I remember nothing."

NOSENKO next mentioned his approach to JOHNSON on 17 April

1964.

Although not immediately recalling JOHNSON's name,

eventually rememtered that "it was semething

coast.

tion sometime in the summer of 1962, after his return to Moscow

from Geneva, because he also remembered wearing "just a coat,

no overcoat at the time."

JOHNSON, who had come to the Soviet

Union as a tourist, was known to be a socialist, and on this

basis the KGB Second Chief Directorate considered him as a

recruitment target.

When the

Second Chief Directorate checked

whether the KGB First Chief Directcrate would have any use for

JOHNSON as an agent, however, it learned there was no interest

In JOHNSON:

He had no access to important information, and he

lived too far from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United

States for conveniert contact.

Several days later KGB surveillance observed JOHNSON

mailing some letters in Moscow.

When read by the KGB they were

found to be

"so bitter toward the Soviet Union, angry, criticad,.

that they /the KGB/ decided something had to be done" to stop

him from writing letters and making anti-Soviet statements on

his return to the United

States.

At about the same time there

was some sign that JOHNSON was a homosexual, and it was decided

to entrap him on this basis.

The sole reason was to halt

JOHNSON's criticism of the USSR - no recruitment was atterpted,

because neither the Pirst nor the Second Chief Directorates

had any use for him as an agent and because the KGB had deter

mined that he probably would not accept a recruitment proposal

anyway.

NOSENKO did not know why he was selected to make the

approach to JOHNSON, except. that "BOBKOV said I should go."

(P. D. BOBKOV, a Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate,

supervised the activities of the Tourist Department.)

In 1962 NOSENKO implied that the KGB received its first

indication of JOHNSON's homosexuality from one or both

these agente.:

JOHNSON became acquainted with VOLKOV and YEFREMOV at the

Metropol Hotel.

They told JOiSON that they had recently ar

rived in Moscow and invited JOHNSON to visit their hotel room.

JOISON agreed because "they understood

each other right away.

They knew they were the same (i.e..

homosexuals) and so he came,

and when they were engaged

in treir business,

our people walked

in on them under the disguise of the hotel administrator and

one militiaman."

Protographs of the incident had been taken,

but these had

developed at the time of this, the first

corfrontation of JorNsoi.

A Ieport describing the circumstances

JOHNSON was then transferred to another

room.

By this time, NOSENKO had arrived at the hotel iron his

office, ard he went into the room where JOHNSON was waiting in

accordance with KGB orders.

NOSENKO discussed the situation

with JOrciSe, then asked

him to type and sign a statement that

he would "not say anything derogatory about the Soviet Union."

JOHNSON did as he was told.

The following day, after the incriminating photographs had

been developed, NOSENKO approached JOHNSON in the cafe of the

Metropol Hotel and asked him whether he intended to keep his

When JOHNSON said that he planned to do so, NOSENKO

presented him with an envelope containing copies of the photo-

graphs and said that they would be leaked to the foreign press

if JOHNSON were to break his promise.

that JOHNSON had visited (or phoned,

according to a later ver-

sion) the U.S.

Embassy and assumed that he had reported the

the militlaman described the incident to him in JOHNSON's pre-

sence. Addressing JOHNSON, NOSENKO had said:

"How come?

How

could you do such a thing?

What are we going to do now?

After

all, this is punishable by court and... people are given from

five to eitht years for such relations. It used to. be three

to five, not it's from five to eight.

Frightened by this,

JOHNSON had written and signed his promise not to denigrate

Union in the future.

NOSENKO was asked whether the KGB would mount such an

operation against any foreigner who wrote uncomplimentary

letters and articles about the USSR.

He replied:

"They don't

jump on everyone, and not everyone writes this. way.

everything that is written this way gets into their hands.

In this case there was a coincidence. " There was something we

could hit him on.

For instance, if the fact that he is a

homosexual didn't come to our attention, they would probably

just say: 'All right, to hell with him.

We have to get rid

of him.

Let's see that his trip is cut off.'".

while discussing the approach to JOHNSON on 30 January

1965,

the following dialogue took place:

course, because we haven't seen him yet. But even that flist

signal

is very helpful:

So if he goes on a Soviet plene, they

will start watching him from the time the flight starts.

Now,

as soOn

as he crosses the korder. he will be watched by the

border guards; he will be watched the entire route of his travel.

This is a very important busiress, because the main task in re-

gard to tourists is

to uncover within the gereral flow of tourists

those persons wao are of

interest from the operational point of

view...

Let's just say that this person is processing a group

of American tourists who are going to the So-iet Union, and,

wt.en the processing is almost finisted, another person is added

to the group.

l'obody knows this person in the group... but he

was added_at the last mirute.

So this is an indication.

This 1s

what he /the agent/ was taught to pay attentic. to when he was

being trained in Moscow...

Now, if some official government

agency makes a request that a man

be sent to the Soviet Union as

•a tourist, this immediately arouses suspicion, of course...

In

such things he has been traired...

He comes to Moscow onie or

twice a year.

You krow, such a little Jewish fellow - an emigre

from fussia - in the past, you inow, scared of everything.

The

last time he cane

he told us:

'You know, I'm thinking about it

all the time, ' he says.

So they asked him: 'Are you afraid?

why are you shaking?'

He says,

•Well, I'm not afraid: I'm not

shaking.

But why should I be caught like an idict...'

His

pseudonym is 'AUD' and his last name is SVE:CHANSKIY. Well.

I'll give you all this later."

NOSENKO told CIA on 14 February 1964 that SVENCHANSKIY was

recruited in 1961 and that in 1963 he, NOSeiKO, had taken over

the handling of this agent from Tourist Department case officer

Ye. N. NOSKOV. *

SVENCHANSKIY had sent the KG3 many open code

messages such

as those described above, and a number of these

messages have been considered to have been of definite opera

tional interest.

NOSENKO identified SVENCHAISKIY as the presi

dent of "Afton Tours" in New York City and the owner of a

Russian-language bookstore in Chicago.

There was some concern on the part of the KGB at the time

of the recruitment in 1960 or 1961, NOSENKO reported on 1 March

1965, because SVENCHANSKIY had had cortacts with AMTORG in New

York City.

The KGB suspected he was an FBI agent, but in con

tacting SVENCHANSKIY in 1960 or 1961, NOSKOV decided that this

was not so and therefore recruited him. (Asked how it was de

termined that SVENQIANSKIY

was not an FBI agent, NOSENKO re-

plied: "NOSKOV felt it:" he had no further explanation.)

The

recruitment was based mainly on an agreement that Inturist

would send more business to SVENCHANSKIY if he cooperated.

NOSENKO also said SVENCHANSKIY had been arrested for black-

marketeering, but he did not elaborate on this statement.

NOSENKO took over the case from NOSKOV in September 1963,

and

his name was entered 'in the single-volume file of SVENCHANSKIY

as the handling officer as of that date.

Together with NOSKOV,

NOSENKO subsequently had two meetings with SVENCHANSKIY when

the latter travelled to the Soviet Union, one in September

and one towards the end. of 1963.

asking to be repatriated

Since the amount and quality of the agent's

to his request for repatriation.

This by diself appeared suspicious to the KC3, bus

in addition, it was alast this time that the agent came into

tact with KOTEN

NOSEUKO learned from BARKOVSKIY that KOTEN

"used to go to some wookstore that sells Soviet literature and

through a saleslady in this story whom KOlai knows, he became

acquainted with the agent. Who also used to go to this store.

to meet with the agent without the saleslady."

On the basis of these incidents the First Chief Direstorate

suspected that kOTEi had been directed specifically to this store

in order to meet and

"work on" the agent and that, having learned

that the agent had relatives "in Stantsiya Loo,

meters from Sochi.., he had evidently received

the assigntent

(to visit the relatives) from American Intelligence.

Evidently

they had gotten on the rall of this agent and were

checking on

him. "

The KGB also had suspicions concerning the relatives,

former kulaks who were still well-off financially.

It was knom.

to the KGB, for example, that the agent had written his sister

in Startsiya Loo that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union.

and

she had replied:

"Is there any sense in your coming here?"

KOTEN arrived in Moscow and then travelled to Socht.

From

there he sent a telegram to the agent's sister and her husband

in Stantsiya Loo, asking them to come to Sochi to see him.

When

they arrived at KOTE!'s hotel: however, the hotel

administrator

told them that KOTEN was on an excursion and refused to allow

= meeting.

KOTIN then took it upor himself to travel to Start-

siya loo where he eventually contacted

and spoke to the rela-

tives.

In the course of this meeting KOTEl took photographs

of the sister and her husband and recorded a message from the

sister

to the agent on a tape resorder he had brought along.

From this the KGB deduced that

"U.S. Intelligence wants to

get

documentary data" and it therefore

decided to "try to get hola

Of KOTEN. "

There had already been some indication during KOTEY's

earlier trips to the USSR that he was a homosexual. but the

KGB had taken no action because KOTEN was believed

loyal Communist Party member.

With these recent developments,

the situation had now changed. Although NOSENKO's superiors

were absent from KGR Headquarters at the time, immediate action

was required.

NOSENKO consequently "took the whole thing on

myself because everybody got excited.. Everybody said: 'Let's

go. American Intelligence is active, none of our bosses are

here,

the situation is right, the decision must be made right

now."*

8. Arrest of BARGHOORS

Information. from NOSENKO

At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO

described the provocation

and

arrest of Yale Uriversity

Professor Frederick BARGHOORY in •late 1963; he was ques-

tioned farther on this case on 3 February

1964 and

again

whilo

waiting in Frankfurt to leave for the United Statos.

NOSENKO's most corprehensive statement, from which the

following paragraphs were largely drain, was made on 9 June

On this last occasion NOSENKO

said that the

of the KGB operation ageinst BARGHOORY was to retallate

for persona non grata action

taken against three Sovietg

in New York CIEy In The case of John W. BUTEV50 and to

secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet in the

EUTENKO case who was jailed.

In Geneva, however, NOSENKO

maintained that the operation against

BARGIlOOPY "was to

discourage future arrests such

as that of IVAvOV (the

Jalled Sovot),

not because of any special importance of

IVANOV hinself."

NOSENKO said that in 1963 four NGB First Chief Direc

torate officers assigned

to the New York Legal Residency

were caught in operational activity in the United States.

Of the four, three had diplomatic immunity, but one vas a

chauffeur and had only a service passport.

The three

Soviet diplomats were held three or four hours by the

American authorities and

IVANOV, the chauf-

feur, was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity.

GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,

learned of this arrest probably the next day and was directed

by KGB Chairman SEMICHASTNIY to take

"necessary moasures."

GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office NOSENKO; A.G.

KOVALENKO, Chief of the Tourist Department; and G.I. GRYAZ

NOV and Ye.J. RASHCHEPOV, both Deputy Chiefs from

the Ameri

can Departeent.

After explaining the arrest, GRIBANOV

asked what information the Second Chief Directorate had on

any American-U.S. Embassy employee or tourist that could

*The detail of NOSENKO's information on the BARGHOORN case

reflects both the extent of the ClA debriefings and the

depth of his knowledge of this case. He did, in fact, fur

nish much of this information during his first 1964 meeting

with CIA.

NOSENKO was also able to describe at length

BARGHOORN's professional background, which gave rise to KGB

suspicions of intelligence affiliation, and he provided the

general outlines of other operational

activity centering

around BARGHOORN during his 1963 trip to the Soviet Union.

**Three Soviets were arrested in Englewood, N.J., on 30 Octo-

ber 1963 during a clandestine meeting with the KGB agent,

BUTENKO, an American engineer.

Two of the Soviets,' G.A.

PAVLOV and Yu.A. ROMASHIN, were members of the Soviet Mis-

Bion to the United Nations; they claimed diplomatic 1mmuni

i*y and were released; a few days later they were declared

persona non grata along with a third Soviet, V.I. OLENEV

not arrested.

serve as material for an arrest.

RASHCHEPOV and GEYAZNOV

said that at that very moment there were three or four

American military attaches in Rostov and that, in the

opinion of the American Department, these officers night

be carrying electronic apparatus.

It nas know that they

had cameras,

that they had been taking

photceraphs, and that

they had been observed taking notes.

If pormitted,

they

could be arrested in Rostov beiore they took the return

plane to Moscow.

GRIBAVOV wanted to know what other pos

sibilities existed and instructed the two representatives

of the American Department to write a report on this:

also told them to request permission to arrest aod search

the military attaches.

GRIBAYOV then asked what pertinent inforration was held

by the Tourist Department.

He was told that there were re-

latively few American tourists in the Soviet Union at that

time;* these included BARGHOORN, who was mentioned

to GRI-

BANOV along with une otber (name not recalled). : NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO reported, however, that the KCB had no. "strong"

materials against then.

They were ordered to make an in

mediate study of the situation and to report back to GRI-

BANOV as soon as possible.

Returning to the Tourist Department, NOSENKO and

KOVALENKO

gathered the entire American Tourist Section in

their office.

In a general discussion, it was decided that

BARGHOORN was the only American on

whom the KGB had anything

worth consideration.

All the materials or BARGHOORN were

gathered together,

and NOSENKO and KOVALENKO took them to

GRIBANOV, explaining that he was the only possibility.

GRIBANOV read all the

materials and was pleased with them;

he was sure that BARGHOORN was connected with

American

Intelligence.

He then asked what could be done.

NOSENKO

and KOVALENKO reported that BARGHOORN was then in Tbilisi

and that, in fact,

Ye.N. NOSKOV (case oificer, Anerican

Tourist

Section)

was in Tbilisi with a woman doctor from

the KGB Operational Technical Directorate for the purpose

of working against BAPGUORN; the doctor had some special

item which

had been used to make BARGIOORN so violently sick

to his stomach that he had to be hospitalized.

While he

was in

the hospital, a careful search had been made of his

belongings, but nothing of operational interest had been

found.

In addition, a KGB agent was placed in BARGIOORN'S

room

as a patient; he

made anti-Soviet statements ard offered

BARG HOORN

"materials," but BARGHOORN did not rise to the

bait.

At the time of this meeting with GRIBANOY, BARGHOORN

wag scheduled to fly from Tbilisi to Moscow the following

morning, and the KGB knew. from a phone tap that he had an

appointment with Theodore ORCHARD of the British Embassy

at the Hotel Metropol the following evening.

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of givid?

"materials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow..

NOSENKO said that this

would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that this made

no difference to him.. He instructed NOSENKO and KOVALENKO

*On another occasion; NOSENKO estimated their number at

"about 60."

to locate an agent

who could be used to pass the damaging

materials

to BARGHOORN and told them to write a surmary of

BARGHOORN's background with a proposal that the Second

Chief Directorate arrest him "when he obtains materials

which are of interest to American Intelligence."

This was

to be

sent in letter form to SESICHASTNYY over GRIBANOV's

signature; the letter was not to indicate how BARGHDORY

was to receive the materials (i.e., the fact of provocation

was

not to be mentioned).

GRIBAIOV took a one-page letter on BARGHOOPS, along

a similar letter from GRYAZNOY and RASUCHEPOV con

cerning the military attaches, to SENICH!SIN:

the four--NOSENKO, KOVALENKO,

GRYAZNOV and KOVALENKD-

were waiting in GRIBAYOV's office for his return, GRYAZNOV

received a telephone call from the local iCB organization

in Rostov informing him that the military attaches were in

the air on their way back to Moscow.

Shortly thereafter,

CRIBANOV returned with the news that the Chairman of the

had approved the arrests of the military attaches as well

as BARGHOORN.

(KHRUSHCHEV was absent fron iloscow at the

time, but SEMICHASTNYY had called BREZHNEV and secured his

approval.*)

When GRIBANOV learned from GRYAZNOV that the military

attaches were already on

their way back to Moscow, he be-

came furious and sent GRYAZNOV out

"to do the job or die."

Meanwhile,

arrangements were made with the

were being picked up, NOSENKO and KOVALENKO returned to

their office to plan the provocation.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance upon

his arrival in Moscow.

At 1810 hours a radio message was

received from one of the surveillance cars that BARGHUORN

had gone to the U.S.

Embassy,

and it was decided that the

agent (nane not recalled, aged 25 to 30 years) would be

placed in contact with him as soon as he came out. The

KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appointment with ORCHARD of the

British Embassy at 1900 hours,

but at 1900 hours a report

was received that BARGHOORN had left the t.s.

Embassy in

the American Ambassador's car. He was alone but

for the

Soviet driver.

Nothing could be done while BARGHOORN was in

the moving car.

A check on ORCHARD established that he was

in the downstairs hall of the hotel waiting.

It was there

fore decided to approach BARGHOORN when he left the car at

the hotel.

#NOSENKO placed these events on the day before BARGHOORN re

turned to Moscow from Tbilisi and on the day before BARGHOORN

was arrested. As indicated below, BARGHOORN returned from

Alma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October 1963 and was arrested on

31 October 1963, six days later. CIA records show that on

30 October, the day before the arrest, XHRUSHCHEV greeted

Laotian Premier SOUVANNA Phouma on his arrival in Moscow and

later in the day attended a luncheon in his honor.. On 31

October, the day of the arrest, KHRUSICHEV and SOUVANNA at-

tended a performance of Swin Lake' in Moscow. BREZHNEV VAS

BARGHOORN had taken only one or two steps when he was

seized by NOSKOV and Petr POPTSOV, another case officer of

the American Tourist Section, and

told he was under arrest.

A surveillance car pulled up.

BARGHOORN was placed in the

car,

handcuffed (on GRIBANOV's orders, because the Soviets

arrested in the United States had received similar treat

ment) and driven to the 50th Section of the Militia, where

a room had been prepared.

L.I. YEFREMOV and K.G. KRUPNOV from the American

Tourist Section were waiting at the Militia station, KRUPNOV

to interrogate BARGIOORN and YETRENOV to be the interpreter.

When BARGHOORN was brought into the station, an "incident

report" form was filled out,

and a resolution was prepared

requesting permission to hold him 48 hours.

Between 0200

and 0300 hours BARGIOORN was taken to the KGB inner prison.

At 0400 hours the Tourist Departnent case officers were

released with instructions to report for duty at 0930

hours.

NOSENKO and the others went home.

KRUPNOV began the

questioning in Russian at 1000

hours the next day.

Although BARGHOORN speaks good Russian,

YEFRENOV remained in case he would be needed to interpret.

NOSENKO entered the room sevcral times during those sessions.

(Although NOSENKO did not want to reveal his face to BARG-

HOORN because he knew BARGHOORN would be released, GRIBANOV

had. told KOVALENKO that NOSENKO should be there when they

reached the point where BARGHOURN was to tell how he obtained

the damaging materials.)

The first sessions concentrated

on general

matters, such as BARGIOORY's life history.*

After one and one half hours of questioning, BARGROORY

agreed that the

materials

were on him when he was arrested,

but he maintained that they had been placed on his person.

He said that he thought they were "newspapers or something,"

that he did not know what they were. The closed package

was then opened and shown to BARGHOORN; it contained about

•20 to 25 pages of information on missiles.

"BARG HOORN

was not,

of course, given

a close look" at the materials.

*In October 1966, NOSENKO stated his certainty that he had

been present on the day after the arrest.

At this interro

The CIA interviever then read to him the report which fixed

the date

of

the approach

as 5. Jaauary 1952,

the date contained

in NOSENKO's notes, and indicated that NOSTiKO used the name

NIKOLAYEV. (see. belon). Acknowledging that "maybe" he had used

the name Georgiy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV with JOHNSON, NOSENKO

said:

"I don't know why I made this mistake with the dates.

I

think it (the approach) wag the first or second day that I was in

the Seventh (Tourist) Departmen:.

I saw myself that he had

(homosexual) intercourse...

Your date is absolutely right, but

this reminded me that it was soor after I had come in the

Seventh (Tourist) Department. Is this irportant?"

Question: How long had you been in the Seventh Department?

NOSENKO:

Now I remember that it was immediately - one or two

days.

I know I returred in Jaruary 1962.

I Knew I

would be going to the Seventh (Departrent) already in

December.

I was visiting the Severth already then.

I had not too many papers to turn over to the first

(American Department), and now I remember that I

moved to the Seventh immediately (NOSENKO's emphasis)

after 1 January 1962.

b. Information from JOHNSON:

JOHNSON reported to the U.S.

Embassy in Moscow on 5 January

1962 that he experienced an

"incident with

Soviet plainclothes-

men in the Hotel Metropol earlier

that day."

JOHNSON, who

arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961, told the consular officer

that "he was dining alone in the Hotel Metropol restaurant the

evening of 4 January when he was joined at his table by a Soviet

citizen who

identified himself as a doctor from Riga.

was NOSENKO's homosexual agent VOLKOV.)

According to JOHNSON,

little conversation

transpired because the Riga 'doctor' spoke

English poorly.

Before JOHNSON left, however, the

said he would like to chat with him and knew a student who

spoke English well.

JOHNSON then agreed so come by the 'doc-

tor's' room at the Metropol at 10:00 a.m. the next day. JOHNSON

said that he dropped by the 'doctor's'

room about 10:00 the

morning of January 5.

Soon

after he entered, the

'doctor" and

his 'student' friend

(NOSENKO's homosexual agent YEFREMOV)

began to make homosexual advances to him. He stated that he

protested and was rising to leave when two plainclothesmen

suddenly appeared in the room and announced that all were under

arrest.

JOHNSON was then taken to another room where he was

asked to sign a statement in Russian..•

rie signed this state-

ment and was taken to a man in a third room who identified him

self as the Chief of Police, Georgiy Ivarovich NIKOLOV.*

and that he, JOHNSON, could be imprisoned for three, five, or

perhaps even eight years. After proceeding in this vein for

NOSENKO frequently used the operational pseudonym Yuriv

He has said that he was normally

called Georgiy, a variation of Yurly, by family and friends

a few minutes, the police chief remarked that it was in his pover

to disties the whole affair, provided JOR:so would do him a

The favor turned out to be a signed comnitment that he

5. Attempt to Recruit BRAUNS

a. Informatior frOm NOSENKO:

NOSENKO made the following statement cr

2 February 1964:

"In 1962 some U.S. citizen by the name of Forst BRAUNS came to

the soviet Union.

I mentioned him to you in 1962 but at that

time could not recall his name.*

Ne tried to recruit him bit

did not succeed.

le lived somewhere in leningrad, and in 1942

he went back with the German troops to Germany.

And he served

in the German Army, and after the war te changed his name and

went to the USt and became a U.S. citizen.

He is either a

skilled mechanic or a worker.

His real name is different. - it 1s

Russian - because he changed his name when he was ir. Germany."

NOSENKO were into the operation against lAu's in greater

detail on 17 April 1961:

"This was LK.GJ KRUPNOV's case.

This fellow was a Russian and

lived prior to the war in Lenin-

grad.

In 1942 he was in Tikhvin, near Lenirgrad, when the

Germans came, and when the Germans were retreating they took

him along and some other people, local people.

and so he foind

himself in Germany.

Now, in Germany, as he told his story, he

was kept in various prison camps and

when the war was over he

worked in West Germany and_then, in 1956 or 1957 or 1958 - I

don't remember. (which year? - he came to the United States and

settled dowr..

why we became interested in this fellow..•

NOSENKO thought his name was something like 'BRUNKS'

•BRONX'/ is because he came from Russia.

so, according to

Soviet law. he never lost his Soviet citizenship..•

Leaving

with the Germans is interpreted as treason, as being a traitor

of your country.

So there was something to talk to him about.

Besides. KRUPNOV found out either in the Information Section

or some other section Lof the KGB First Chief Directoratg/

that the man is working in some: very interesting: company that

makes, computers of adding machines or some other instruments.

But when I talked to him he already left the company.

Information fros BARGHOORN

BARGHOORN, who had made five earlier trips to the

Soviet Union since 195b, arrived there

on 2 October 1963.

The

purpose of his visit, as stated in his visa application,

was to gather

information for a book on how effectively the

Soviet Union was operating as a result of its political ed

ucation and political system.

His itinerary took hin to

Leningrad from 2 to 7 October, to Moscow fron 7 to 10 Octo

ber,

Tbilisi from 10 to i7 October, and short visits to

Tashkent,

Bukhara,

Samarkand, and Alma-Ata from 17 to 25

October.

He flew

fron Alma-Ata to Moscow on 25 October and

was scheduled to leave for Warsaw on 31 October.

On the

laiter date he was arrested and held by tne KGB until

16 November when, at President Kennedy's intervention, he

was released and left the Soviet Union. BARGHOORN had no

intelligence mission.

Upon his return to the United States, BARGHOORN waS

debriefed by the U.S. Department of State

and by CIA.

His

information indicated a high degree of KGB operational in

terest in him throughout the trip, including encounters with

at least five probable KGB agents during his first week

there:

an attractive waitress who invited him to "do the

town," a disenchanted intellectual in Leningrad, an attrac

•tive unattached girl who sat next to him on

the

flight from

Moscow to Tbilist, and two young Armenians whom he met his

first day in Tbilisi.*

The two Armenians were instrumental

in the drugging described by NOSENKO.

At dinner in his

hotel on the day he arrived in Tbilisi, BARGHOORN met &

joung man claiming to be a student at

the Leningrad Music

Conservatory.

They left the hotel for a walk and ran into

a friend of the student, a second young Armenian, and the

three of them went to a cafe for coffee.

None was available,.

*Questioned about this in February 1965,

NOSENKO said that

BARGHOORN, as a suspected American Intelligence agent, was

of operational interest throughout the trip.

He vaguely re-

called the girl on the plane but either did not know or had

forgotten details of any other specific activity.

NOSENKO

said that none of this activity was directly related to the

provocation operation, which was based on a last-minute de-

cialon.

but the young student went to the kitchen "to arrange things,"

and

shortly thereafter "throe foul-tasting coffees"

appeared.

Within an hour, BARGHOORN was in the hospital, acutely-ill.

He was assigned to a room where there was another patient,

and a woman doctor took care of his case.

He was in the

hospital for four days. During this period his clothes,:

notes, and other possessions were held by hospital authori

ties.

Upon his roturn to Moscow by air on 25 October, BARG-.

HOORN checked into the Metropol Hotel.

The next six days

were occupied by sightseeing and appointments connected with

his research.

•In

the late afternoon of 31 October he called

on friends at the t.S. Embassy for cocktails, and at 1910,

already 10 minutes late, be left in the Ambassador's car for

a dinner appointment (prearranged by telephone) at the Metro-

pol with Theodore ORCHARD, & British diplomat.

BARGHOORN's account of the subsequent events closely

parallels NOSENKO's.

laving been handed the incriminating

formed Militia officer.

The KGB was called.

Within 30

minutes a

KGB captain (BARGHOORY thought his name night

have been GORBUNSKIY) arrived and began to question him,

assisted by an interpreter named YEFREWOV.*

All question

were asked in Russian, and BARGHOORN answered most of them

in English.

The package of materials was opened and con-

tained, according to BARGHOORN,

13 or 14 photographs of

rockets.

This session lasted until about midnight and

centered around BARGHOORN's possession of the photographs

and his "intelligence mission."

He was then taken to the

Lyubyanka prison.

Interrogations were conducted the next mornirg by the

original KGB officer

together with his "chief," whom BARG-

HOORN subsequently identified by photograph as NOSENKO.

The

questioning concerned BARGHOORN's biography, and nothing was

asked about the compromising raterials.

The following day

the case was turned over to a KGB colonel identified as (fnu)

PETRENKO,

and BARGHOORN did not see NOSENKO or the other KGB

officer again.

At this and subsequent sessions, BARGHOORN

was questioned further concerning the circumstances of his

arrest.

BARGHOORN described NOSENKO as "clever and quick-

witted" and as giving

"the impression that he ras not a

dedicated careerist,

but opportunistic and adaptive; he

seemed

not to care about what he was doing, but doing a good

Job nevertheless."

#Asked why YEFREMOV used his true name during the interro-

gations, NOSENKO said this was necessary for legal reasons..

that he had to sign documents connected with the interroga

tions.

BARGHOORN confirmed that YEFREMOV had participated

throughout the entire series of interrogations and had

signed interrogation reports attesting to the accuracy of

10. BOLSHAKOV, Robert Kennedy, and the Cuban Missile Crisis

a. Iatroduction

XOSENKO volunteered at his s+cond meeting with CIA

in January 1904 that G.X. BOLSHAKOY was his "old friend"

and that he was a colonel in the CRU.

On. 26 January,

I February, and 19 August 1964 he again raised BOLSHAKOV'S

name,

euphasizing that he was a GRU

officer and a "good

friend."

In the 1 February interview, after displaying an

initial reluctance to discuss with CIA such a "sensitive"

subject, he provided a numbor of details on BOLSHAKOV's

alleged relationship in 1962 with tle then Attorney General,

Robert Kennedy.

His

information on this subject,

he said,

derived from his friendship with BOLSHAKOY in Moscow, where

BOLSHAKOV was reassigned (in December 1962 following a tour

in Washington as Novosti correspondent and editor of the

magazine USSR).

JOSENKO Claimed a personal role in this

afrair,

in that he personally proposed to the KGB leader-

ship that the KGB take

over BOLSHAKOV's former (GRU) COn-

tact with Robert Kennedy.

NOSENKO claimed that an information channel of coz

munication between BOLSHAKOV and the Attorney Ceneral had

developed at Kenredy's initiative.

He described in detali

the circumstances of their introduction at a social function

by a journalist (whom he did not name).

He said that he

"thought" that the Kennedys knew that BOLSILAKOY Was a

"military intelligence officer," and he implied that they

regarded these private conversations with BOLSHAKOV as &

useful instrument of diplomacy.

According to YOSENKO, the

KGB knew that CIA was not aware of this relationship it

was "obvious" that Robert Kennedy wanted it that way.

NOSENKO claimed that after BOLSHAKOV left the United States

"during the Cuban missile rrisis,"* no one took over his

role as a confidential channel to the White House.

• After

the assassination of the President. NOSENKO continued, the

Kennedy family tried to reestablish the relationship through

their close triend, the artist Willian. WALTOS, during the

latter's vistt to Moscow in December 1963.

NOSENKO reported

that he had urged

that the KGB try to take over the Robert

Kennedy operation from the GRU and that he had proposed two

plans which would have enabled this to take place, the

second involving WALTON.

Neither came to fruition, however.

Referring to the Cuban missile crisis, NOSE KO said_that the

GRU had "played dirty" with BOLSHAKOV by forcing him to "tell

Robert" that there were no offensive missiles in Cuba whereas

there actually were such weapons there.

According to other

sources, BOLSHAKOV left Washington

for Moscow on 3 August 1962 and returned on 2 October 1962.

on 2s August, about the time that CIA was reporting urgently

to the President that "something new and different" was

going on with respect to soviet ald to cuba, Ambassador

DOBRYNIN assured Theodore SORENSEN. (Special Counsel to the

President, that the United States had no need to fear Soviet

"The Cuban missile erisis occurred durtog October I962, and

s indicated above, BOLSHAKOV was not reassigned from

Washingtos until two months afterward.

C.

SOSENKO's Statements on BOLSHAKOV

NOSENKO repeatedly eophasized BOLSHAKOV's CRU affilia-

tion

and the

fact that the KGB was in no way involved in

+r.15

charnel to the U.S. Coverrment via Robert Kennedy.

He first volunteered BOLSHAKOY's nave during a discussion

of the use of Novosti as

a cover organization for Soviet

Intelligence officers.

"Jury BOLSHAKOV of the GRU also

sits there, " he sadd.

"Ile is a colonel and a friend of

mine."

Two days

later,

out of context with

the preceding

discussion, he introduced the name again:

"Then

there is

this BOLSHAKOV.

He is from GRU who was in the United

States."

NOSENKO then cormented that this was

"a very in

teresting cast" and added:

"We shall talk about it later."

When his case

oflicer trer-upon turned to

another topic,

JOSENKO immediately interrupted to say:

"I know BOLSHAKOV

very well.

He is my old

friend...l met him through Yurly

GUk... Iwho was with hin in the

United States...and we are

now very good friends.

He calls me up and consults me for

advice...

On 1 February 1964 NOSESKO said he thought the

Kennedy family knew BOLSHAKOV to be a military inteiligence

officer; "yet for sore reason they chose him" as a channel

between the U.S. ard Soviet Goverrments.

BOLSHAKOV, NO-

SENKO

added,

"reported directly" to

the Chief of the GRU

concerning his exchanges with Robert Kennedy.

SOSESKO Said BOLSHAKOY was introduced to Robert Kennedy

by an

American journalist (unnamed) at z ricoption in the

United States.

The jourralist invited BOLSHAKOV to go for

a walk,

and as they

strolled "down an alley," there was a

"The jour-

man sitting

nalist said:

isten, derre (BoLsHako, are you acquainted

with Robert Kennedy,

the brothar of the President and the

Chief of

the Department of Justice?'

BOLSHAKOV said:

'No.

Of course, I have heard of him.

•Would you like me to

introduce you?'

"Of course, " BOLSHAKOV said,

'please do.'

He led him to the man on the bench.

There was this feeling

that all this had been pre-arranged."

This contact'was at the personal desire of Bob Kennedy.••

BOLSHAKOV was called ia for this.

As you know, the whole

idea of this contact was to pass information to Kennedy

from KIPESHCHEV and from Kernedy to KHRLSHCHEV....It happened

to be BOLSHAKOV, but it was not BOLSIlAKOY who sought to

have the meeting....Then the relationship grew. BOLSHAKOV

was a visitor in Robert Kennedy's house.

They would first

talk about ordinary things, and them the conversation-

turned to other mattars. Robert Kennedy did not say:

"Please tell KHRUSHCHEV

so-and-so.'

He would

say:

• You

know, some of these

problens seem

insoivable," And BOI

SHAKOV would say:

'And you know, at home they think this

and that

way..•

without sctually saying that this was coming

frOm KHRUSHCHEY.

But, of course,

this was clear sithout

explanations.

It was ar exchange of views on important poll-

tical questions

of the moment.

He was like an intermediate

point..."

NOSENKO commented that he persorally thought

that it was a "case of mutual

'feelers' being sent out by

both sides exploring some given current political situation."

After BOLSHAKOV left Washington,

NOSENKO stated,, no one

replaced hin as a chancel to the U.S. Government.

like there was before.

It was broken at the time BOL

SHAKOV left. ZINCHUY. was an agent or a cooptre....No,

there is no such

contact since BOLSHAKOY left. He passes

no more messages."

Referring to the Kennedy-BOLSHAKOV contacts, NOSENKO

told CIA on 26 January 1964:

"You have shown considerable

interest in him ! BOLS!LAKOV|, even after his return to the

Soviet Union... because all

this was done by by-passing CIA."

He said on 1 February 1961:

"It was pretty obvious that

this

relationship between BOLSHAKOV and Robert Kennedy had

nothing to do with ClA,

and CIA was not witting of 1t.

It

wag at the perschal desire of Bob Kenredy."

The KGB

determined that CIA was ureware of the exchange between

Kennedy and BOLSHAKOV, NOSENKO reported, because when BOL-

SHAKOV was subsequently invited to a reception at the U.S.

Embassy in Moscow, two CIA officers-Kenneth A. KERST and

Malcoln A. TOON*-tried to elicit infornation from him

about his relationship with President Kennedy.

"The most.

important thing" they had tried to find out,

according to

NOSENKO, was whetter the President and BOLSHAKOV had met

personally.

Although BOLSHAKOV did not adnit the fact to

them, he did have one meeting with President Kennedy "he

was brought in a car...and was taken through a back door

into the thite House,

NOSENKO said.

NOSENKO reported that Will am WALTON visited Moscow:in Docen-

ber 1963 and at that time went to BOLSHAKOV, whom he had

previously met at the home of Robert Kennedy.

Part of

their conversations, he continued, related to Robert Kennedy's

future political plans:

"WALTON said that Bobby. did not

expect at present to become a candidate for the vice presi

dency.

He was, perhaps, according to WALTON, thinking of

running for Governor of Massachusetts.."

NOSENKO said he

felt that there were "some feelers sent out on

the part of

WALTON-not exactly questions, but just a passing of opinion.

WALTON was trying to sound them out, but I think that every

thing was left without an answer....My personal opinion was

that these things were told to

Another topic covered in the WALTON-BOLSHAKOV discussions,

NOSENKO added, was the assassination of President Kennedy

"As I remember, it was WALTON's opinion-and bis opinion re-

flected the opinion of the Kennedy family-that there was

no Russian involvement In the murder of the President. No-

suspicion at all."

NOSENKO proposed two plans

over the GRU's channel to President Kennedy.

first of these plans, the Soviet Minister of Justice would

personally invite the Attorney Gencral to come to the soviet

Union.

There the KGB would "set him up in private. llving.

My time in

grade was up in December, In December of last

year (1961)."

23 January 1964:

At the first of his 1964 meetings

CTX in Geneva TOSENKO had in his possession the ten

porary duty authorization which he said he had been issued

in December 1963 to travel ¿rom Moscow to Gorkly Oblast in

connection with the search for CHEREPAYOV.* This official

AuB paper had been signed by O.J. GRIBAYOV, Chief of the

second Chief Directorate, and authorized. "Licutenant Colonel

Yurly Ivanovich NOSENKO to visit the local KGB organiza-

tion in Gorkig Oblast on official business between 15 and

30 December 1963."

It bure official starps of arrival and

departure in December 1963, as attested by oificials in the

town of Shakhunya.

10 February 1964:

In Frankfurt, while awaiting er

filtration to the UnIted States, NOSENKO was asked to review

a biographic statement which had been prepared by his case

officers on the basis of statements he had made during the

1962 and 1964 meetings in Geneva.

NOSENKO went over the

biography carefully, noted several changes, and then stated

that it was correct.

The biography included the inforration

that NOSENKO had served in the U.S. Embassy

Section of the

American Department as a senior lieutenant from 1952 (sic)

to 1955, that he was promoted to captain in 1956, to major

In 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963, shortls

before leaving Moscow for Geneva.

8 April 1964: NOSENKO was questioned about the date

when he became a senior lieutenant, and he replied:

think in the end of '53 or the beginning of '54 I got the

senior lieutenant."

Question:

That's less

than a year after you entered the

it was

considered as a contacuance of military service.

Question:

NOSENKO :

So you got it when? At tha end of 1953?

At the end of 853 or bezinding of '54. Then I

got captain in 1956.

Question:

When in 1956?

NOSENKO:

I don't remember.

You see, they are not given

exactly in February or in

March.

Sometimes the

scheduled tine

passes before they give it. So,

'56--Captain, '59--lajor, and '63--

16 June 1964:

Asked to list in chronological order the

date of his promotions within the KGB from the date of

entry, NOSENKO stated:

"I began in the GRU as a junior

lieutenant. While in the GRY I became a lieutenant: and I

entered the KGB with this rark in 1953.

Not long after I

entered the KGB I became a senior lieutenant, but i don't

know the month. It was still 1953.

In 1956 I was promoted

to the rank of captain.

I don't know the month.

I became

a major ir 1959.

I don't know the month.

In October 1963

1 wa: made a licutenant colonel... Personnel called

me on

the elephone and said I had been promoted. Later I was

told that GRIBANOV wanted to see me.

I went to his office,

but, of course, I didn't let hin know that I already knew

that I had been promoted.

He gave me his congratulations.

You never see the attestation. It goes into your official

file."

26 January 1965:

While discussing his role as case

officer for V.S. Embassy Security Officar John ABIDIAN,

NOSENKO volunteered out of context that he had never offi

clally been a najor.

He explained this situation as

follows:

Having been promoted to the rank of senior

lieutenant in April 1953, he vecame eligible for the rank

of captain in 1956.

When this time came, however, he was

not promoted because a senior KGB official held against

him his illegal use of KCB_ documents to cover_ treatment for

gonorrhea in 1954.

NOSENKO therefore remained

a senior

lieutenant until 1959, when he would have been eligible

for promotion to the rank of major had he received his

captaincy on schedule.

Altlough GRIBANOV had promised NO.

SENKO that he would be promoted directly from senfor lieu

tenant to major, skipping the rank of captain, an

admihi

strative error was made by the KGB

Personnel Office,

and

NOSENKO found when the orders were issued that he had in

stead been promoted.only to captain.

Instead of rectifying

this mistake, GRIBANOV persuaded NOSENKO that it would be

to his advantage

to remain a captain until he became eligible

for promotion

to lieutenant colonel in

1963.

NOSENKO there.

fore was a captain fron September or October 1959 until

October 1963 when; as promised by GRIBAYOV, he was promoted

directly to the rank of licutenant colonel.

In-this manner- it

turned out that he never officially held the rank of major.*

10 August 1905; Under questioning by DoRYABIN, NOSESKO

repeated the chronology of his pronotions glen on 26 January

1965.

He again explained that he was put up for captain in

1956, but this time said that the pronotion had bech blocked

on the grounds that he should be made to wait because of

shortconings in his work.

Asked why he had told CIA that ho

had been a major during the 1962 meetings and again in the

blography prepared in Frankfurt, NOSENKO replied that he

thought the true story would not bo believed.

17 April 1966:

In a voluntary statement, NOSENKO wrote

the

following: In March

2951, with the rank of junior lieu-

tanant, I started service in Naval Intelligence of the Seventh

Flcit in Sovetskaya Gavan...Fron August 1952 until 1953, I

worked it the intelligence base of the Naval Intelligence of

the Fourth Fleet in Sovutsk, where I received the rank of

to: the rank of major.

I lave never held the rank of lieuten

ant coloned ond the travel cider which you know of, with the

rank of lieutenant colorcl, was filled out erroneously.**

19 April 1966:

In a new version of his autobiography,

NOSENKO Included The following statement:

"in July 1956. 1

became a candidate member of the CPSU, soon after which I re

ceived a promotion at work: I became a senior case officer

and was given the rank of serior licutenant. In August 1957

I was accepted into the CPSU, and during the second half of

1958 was appointed Deputy Chief of the Second Section, Seventh

Department.

On 29 Decenber 1959 1 was promoted to the rank of

captain.

26 October 1966: "I lied when I said I was a lieutenant

colonel in 1954.

'Twas only a captain."

Asked why he had

said in 1962 that he was then a major, NOSESKO replied:

"There was no conversation about rank in 1962.

About my po-

sition, I said I was in the Tourist Department. That's all."

To summarize what NOSENKO has said about his ranks while

•serving in the KGB:

He became a senior iicutenant in 1952,

April 1953, 1951, or 1956; a captain ir.

1956 or September/Octo=

ber/December 1959: A major in December 1958 or 1959; and a

lieutenant colonel in October/November 1963.

(The latter

clain was verified by the official KGB document listing him as

• lleutenant colonel as of December 1963.)

On tho other hand,.

NOSENKO has indicated that his highest rank in the KGB was

captain, and that he never advanced

to a majority or a lieu.

tenant colonelcy.

*At about this time, in carly 1965,

NOSENKO was only a captain and had advanced to his senior

KGB position because of his close relationshio. with GRIBANOV•

Awards and Decorations

Not long alter reestablishing contact with CIA in

January 1964, NOSENKO mentioned that he had received the

Order of Lenin

"shortly after the 1962 meetirgs" in Geneva

as a reward

for the ideas which he had developed

to "eni.

large the experience and improve the quality' of KGB Second

Chief Directorate staff personnel in Moscow.* Diring the

first series of interrogations, NOSENKO on 6 April 1964.

claimed that he was awarded the Order of Lenin in 1963 for-

his work in the Tourist Department, KGB Second Chief DireC

torate, after receiving the Order of the Red Banner in 1962

for his performances while in the American Department.

The following discussion of the subject took place on

6 April 1964:

JOSENKO: • Yes, -I received a big gold nedal.

Question: It was the Order of Lenint

NOSENKO:

It was at first the Order of the Red Ranner--the

You must know that the main task of the Seventh

Department is cot recruitrents.

The main task is

countering the intelligence activities of the op

So, the Chief and the Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Department got the Order of Lenin?

NOSENKO: Yes.

#NOSENKO has described the Order of Lenin as the highest

decoration for which a KGB officer can

be eligible.

#*In June 1964 NOSENKO said that the only Second Chief Direc

torate officer whom he knew to have received this award was

V.A: CHURANOV, Chief of the British Embassy Section, who re-

cruited William John VASSALL (see PART VI.D.5.b.)•

On the

same general topic, NOSENKO asked his CIA case offteer whether

he, the CIA officer, had received a medal for his part ta:

the 196% meetings with NOSENKO.

He asked this in January 1964

ranking KGB officers were awaided it for the imporant role

they played in smashing the Hungarian Revolution in 1956.

#NOSENKO's wording

here reflects earlier intensive ques

cloning concerning the ten-year service medal.

NOSENKO said

on 15 April 1964:

"In 1962 I had ten years of service in

the KGB and got a medal for unblemished service. It is

usually given for ten years and to KCB men only.... That was

In 1962-

I had ten years of service then."

When it was

pointed out that, according to his most recent statement,

he had joined the KGB in March 1953 and therefore would

have had only nine years of service in 1962, NOSENKO said he

did not understand why but that he was certain that he had

been given the medal, after his return from Geneva in 1962-

(The 1962 date is consistent with NOSENKO's earlier statements

that he joined the KGB in 19520)

The following day, 17 April

1964, NOSENKO said that he remembered why he had received

the medal in 1962 ratber than 1963; this medal, he recalled,

1s awarded to servicemen as well as KGB officers, and prior

military service is taken into account in computing the

service time for the latter.

NOSENKO had: entered the GRU

in 1950 and therefore should have received the ten-year

medal in 1960, Because o. a nix-up in the-KGB Personnel

H. NOSENKO's. Relationship with GRIBAVOV

1: Information from NCSENKO

a. Summary

From the time of his first meetings with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO

maintained that he had a close personal and professional

relation

Ship with Major. General O.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of tre Second Chief

Directorate.

NOSENKO has described recruitment approaches in which

he and GRIBANOV took part together,

conversations they had on opera-

tional matters, the role which GRIBNOV played in his rank promo-

tions and receipt of various awards, and his afterhours carousing

with GRIBANOV and First Chief Directorate ccunterinteiligence

officer Ye.A. TARABRIN.

NOSENKO has also freguently mentiored the

role which GRIBANOV played in his, HOSENKO's, professional advance-

ment within the KGB:

GRIBANOV was wholly responsible, against

NOSENKO's wishes, for his appointment to the position of Deputy

Chief of the U.S. Embassy

Section of the American

Department in

January 1960; later, when NOSENKO rejected his offer to make him

Deputy Chief of the

entire American Department, GRIBANOV arranged

his return to the tourist Department as Chief of the American

Tourist Sectior. and

his later appointment as Depity Chief of the

Tourist Department.

NOSENKO's remarks concernirg

nis direct involvement with

GRIBANOV in operations against Americans are incladed in other

parts of this paper.

Among them are

his early statements on the

approach to code clerk James STORSBERG

(Part V.E.3.c.), bis 1962

account of the arres: and attempt to recruit ClA gificer Eussell

LANGELLE (Part VieD. 7.a.), and his early reports on the attempt to

reCruit CIA officer

Edward Ellis SMITil (Part VI.D.2.).

In all

three cases NOSENKO subsequently denied having played

the role he

originally attributed to himself and denied having had personal

contact with the Anericans involved.

NOSENKO has also altered his

original accounts to say that he received no awards or decoration

for operational activity and that he had not received the promo

tions he claimed.

b. Details

The statements of NOSENKO given below corcern primarily his

personal relationship with GRIBANOV and how GRIBANOV assisted

his rapid rise within the organization of the Second Chief Direc-.

torate.

12 June 1962:

"Oleg

One of NOSENKO'S CIA handlers suggested at

this point that GRIBANOV seemed to treat NOSENKO as an Older

brother would. NOSENKO replied:

"That's his attituce toward

ne."

Were you ever out at night with him, after work?

If so, how, under what circumstances?

After work? Yes, once.

NOSENKO:

Question: Who else was there?

NOSENKO:

TARABRIN.

Question: What was the occasion?

NOSENKO:

No specific reason.

GRIBANOV called me at midnight.

I could hear that

he was already drinking; he asked

Question:

NOSENKO:

the evening...

GRIBANOV was sloppy drunk, lay down

to rest, he needed a couple of hours of sleep.

I

drove him and TARABRIN home, got him there at 6:00

a.M., gave him some pills to help him:

when did you first personally meet GRIBANOV?

I might have seen him in 1953 or 1954, but I did not

have a chance to

group operationalspeak to him then.

Once I was in two

discussions (about 15 people present)

about work against Military Attaches in 1954, that was

the. first time I ever spoke to him.

NOSENKO:

Question:

NOSENKO:

I don't remember. He gathered groups of people:

Maybe I was with him with KOZLOV and

others in Tourist

Department li.e., between 1955 and 1960).

When did you develop a personal relationship with him?

It is difficult to gay how it got started.

I was

still working in tre Seventh

Department.

It was in

1958, 0r maybe 1957.

KOZLOV suddenly called me and

said

I should immediately report to GRIBANOV.

I did,

and GRIBANOV said:I should quickly be ready to go to

a reception with him at the Indian Embassy, with him

and Vera [Ivanovna] ANDREYEVA.

Question: Why you?

NOSENKO:

I don't know...

Oh, yes, this is the story.

this is it, this is

why he started favoring me.

Earlier,

some time in 1953, I knew some gills, Nira

on

Pokrovskiy Boulevard and her girlfriend, Rina GUDKOVA,

friends of (Yu.I.] GUK and [V.M.) KOVSHUK and (V.A.)

CHURANOV.

CHURANOV was a friend of TARABRIN, who was

a friend

of GRIBANOV.

Through TARAERIN he got acquainted

with these girls, and TARABRIN brought them to GRIBANOV' s

dacha one night.

The girls were talkative and told me

all about it, and said they'd told CHURANOV. I told

CHURANOV who warned me not

to mention it.

I never did,

and GRIBANOV learned about this and liked it; he re-

marked once: "You are not a gossiper..."

Question:

How did he find out that you knew and didn't tell any

one?

NOSENKO:

Question:

NOSENKO:

Question:

NOSENKO:

I don't know, but he did.

Who wrote your fitness reports?

My last one was written by (V.D.) CHELNOKOV. The one

before that by (V.A.) KLYPIN, in the First Department.

Before that in the Seventh Department it was written

by [K.N.] DUBAS, before him by (V.A.l KOZLOV,

then

(s.V.] PERFILYEV and before then, in the First Depart-

ment, by lA.M. I GORBATENKO.

Did GRIBANOV ever write a fitness report on you?

He may not have actually written them, but he signed

them, those reports written

connection with pro

motions to higher jobs or for trips abroad, or general

reviews of personnel.

15 February 1965 (from a protocol signed: 20 February 1965):

"Before I joined the KGB in 1953 I had never heard the name of

Oleg Mikhaylovich GRIBANOV. and knew nothing about him.

AS (E.G.)

SHUBNYAKOV rather than GRIBANOV, was the Deputy Director of the

Second Chief Directorate responsible for supervising the acti

it may have been several months after I

began my KGS service that

GRIERIOV

first came to my attention.

I don't know when I first

saw GRIBA:OV but it may have been approximately 1953 at a meetirg

before May Day or the 7 November holiday.

I'would not

necessarily

remember this as I frequently met much more important

people,

were friends of my father, and seeing GRIPANOV wouid. t

have

been

particularly important to me.

Sometimes during 1954 and 1955, it

was necessary to obtain the signature of a Depicy Chief of the

Second Chief Directorate on a cable

that. I had written

and, if

SHUBNYAKO: was absent at the time, I would take it to GRIBANOV

for approval.

Though I was only a junior case officer at the

tine, I would take the cable, after it had boen approved by the

Chief of Section and the Chief of Department, directly to GRIBAKOV,

who would simply sign it with

no discussion.

I do not cerember how

many times I

took cables to GRIBANOV nor do I remember the

contents

of any specific one of them. The first meeting with GRIBANOV

that

I specifically remember was in the summer of 1956.

I think it was

in June.

I had returned from Kiev with KOZLOV and, after writing

a spravka on EURGI, PERFILYFV, KOZLOV, and I went to see GRIBArOV.

KOZLOV didn't introduce me to GRIBANOV at that time, but CRIBANOV

knew that I was NOSENKO because the plan for the BUGGI operation

said that I would participate and because PERFILYEV had made an

appointment for the three of us to speak to GRIS at this time.

The neeting lasted about 30 or 40 minutes. GRIBANOV read the re

port on BURGI's recruitment and asked some questions.

KOZLOV

answered some of these and I answered others.

Other than asking

what Ukrainians

took part in the operation, I can recall none of

GRIBANOV's questions nor do I remember any of the conversation

which took place at this meeting.

When we were through, KOZLOV

and I left while PERFILYEV remained with GRIBAYOV..

Perhaps the

first time I was alone with GRIBANOV was in 1958 when I attended

a reception given by the Indian Embassy at the Sovetskaya Hotel

in Moscow.

Usually (A.V.) SUNTSOV accompanied GRIBAVOV on such

occasions, but he was sick at the time.

I don't knos why SUNTSOV

usually went with GRIBANOY, why I was

selected to go, or what I

was supposed to do at the reception.

I think GRIBANOV called the

Seventh Department and asked whom he could use, but I don't know

why he picked

me.

GRIBANOV told me that, at the reception, I was

to refer to him as Aleksey Mikhaylovich GORBUNOV.

I was to

introduce myself as Yuriy Ivanovich and if anybody asked, would use

the last nane MIKOLAYEV. Vera ANDREYEVA, who went with us, used

the name Vera Ivanny.:a. After work, I went home to change my

clothes and we went in GRIBANOV's car from the KGB to the Hotel

Sovetskaya.

GRIBANOV sat in front with the driver and I sat in

back with Vera ANDREYEVA. I cannot say how many times I have seen

GRIBANOV altogether.

From 1959 on I saw him more frequently.

Sometimes, GRIBANOV would call meetings of chiefs of sections and

their deputies and I would take part in these.

In July 1962 I was

this decision

was male by CHELYOKOY and GRIBALOV in

accordance with the intention

stated by GRIBANOV at the end of 1961 that I should be appinted

to this position as soon as possible. I had no further personal

di cussions with GRIBINOV about this

decided that I should be named

They üid not ciscuss this with ma beforehand and no

I has simply told that

from that time I would be considered as First Deputy Chief of the

At this time I was, in fact, the only Deputy Chief of

the Seventh Department,

since KOROBOV did not come to the seventh

November or December 1963.

GRIBANOV did

not tell me his reasons for appointing me

BOBKOV,

I did not personally

discuss this trip with GRIBANOV before my departure from Moscow.

My candidacy for this assignment was supported oy BANNIKOV, the

Deputy Chief of the Second Chief Directorate who supervised the

work of the Eleventh Department which had the investigative file

go as case officer on this trip because SHAKOV, who was suspected

nel Office of the Second Chief Directorate, by the Central Personnel

GRIPANOV

had absolutely nothing to do with my assignment to Geneva in 1964.

For

the 1964 trip no decision of approval of the Central Committee of

23 February 1965 NOSENKO commented further on his social

encounters

With GRIBANOV and TAPARPIN.

The following, which was

not included in the protocol quoted above, is tarr. from case

officer notes.

Question: Teil me about the occasions when you were with GRIBANOV

and TARABRIN.

NOSENKO:

Three times--drinking in cafes.

Twice afterwards there

were girls.

The most recent time was ir September or

October 1963. I don't remenber the firit time..

In

1963 I received a call from TARMiRI!! at home.

Then

GRIBANOV got on the phone and told me to take his car

and come join them

at the Praga Restaurant.

I didn't

take his car because I didn't want to call the duty-

officer.

I took a cab and vent to the Fraga.

They

were sitting there and drinking in a private room.

joined them.

They were drinking champagne, but I took

cognac.

TARABRIN suggested girls about 1230 and GRIBANOV

made

me go to the office to get my nutebook. I called

one girl I knew her and her sister.

when I got back

to the restaurant it was closed with only GRIBANOV and

TAPABRIN still there.

We lent to the girls' (apartment).

They weren't prostitutes exactly. I knew her before.

Question:

Is this why GRIBANOV called you to the restaurart (i.e..

to provide girls)?

NOSENKO:

I think so.

It was the second time I had participated

in this.

This last time CRIBANOV told the

girl his

name.

The girl works in the Archives of the First Chief

Directorate.

At that time of night I rasn't able to

reach anyone else.

Iler name is Galina Mikhaylovna.

Her mother works in the Central Committee.

remember her last name.

GRIBANOV was drinking and she

told him that she had

quarreled with ZAYTSEV, the Chief

of the First Chief Directorate Archives.

told her that he would give her a job and told me to

arrange for a job in the American Department of the

Second Chief Directorate for her.

Galina's flat is in

the building inhabited by Central Committee workers on

Kutuzovskiy Prospekt.

GRIBANOV's driver drove him

home at 0600 and he was in the office by 0830.

3 March 1965:

Speaking of the damage his disclosures must

have caused the KGB, NOSENKO said:

"I believe they will punish

people in the Second Chief Directorate (SCD]...

Even GRIBANOV. • •

He was personally responsible, as head of the

SCD, for pushing

me ahead."

Question: What sort of punishment?:

NOSENKO: Even firing.

Question:

Do you think any others would be punished, or even

fired?

NOSENKO:

Maybe KOVALENKO, BOBROV, and people in the Eleventh

Department. Many others, too.

previously reported on him; CIA records, however, show that

GOLITSYN had reported only on, one Aleksandr feuoseyevich NOSENO,

who had been a KGB officer in Japan when RASTVOROV defected to

the U.S. in 1954. GOLITSYN made no further comments on these

except to say that one identified as KGB had left that

organization in 196l for the MVD. GOLITSYN said that in general,

lacking the full details necessary for an assessment, he could

say that there were serious signs ot aisinformation in what ne

had seen; he wanted to see the fulf information on

the case.

Subseguently GOLITSYN made numerous demands for this informa-

CIA officials because his request nad not been granted.

his RGB affiliationa

When GOLIFSTV heard this news he immediately

recalled the June 1962 "letter" in Switzerland and Linked NOSENKO
