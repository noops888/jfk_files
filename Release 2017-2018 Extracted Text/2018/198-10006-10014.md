1, Travel to and from Cuba

Bragii

Chartered Cubana Airlines flights between Cuba and
Brazil have become a. major means of transporting non-Cuban
Latin Americans to and from Cuba. The five such flights since
late July have carried nearly 400 nom-Cubans.

The firet ef the recent series -~ on 25 July -- brought
7i Latin Americen passengers te Havana for the 26 July celebra<-
tions, The other four flights -- on 15, 22, 28 and 29 August <-
transported over 200 Latin Americans to Brazil from Havana.

Some of the airevaft invelved returned to Cuba with smaller
numbers of pasgengere. Many of the 200 Latin American passengers
had been delegates to the 26 July ceremonies, but others had
apparently been in Cuba for longer periods and eome had probably
received training there, Of the passengers on these four flights
te Brasil, 75 were natives of Caribbean area countries, Their
cireultous travel through Brazil was evidently designed to help
conceal the fact that they had been in Cuba.

Costa Rica

: Two Costa Ricans were among the passengers on a
chartered Cubana plane which was turned back to Navana at Grand
Cayman 6a 11 July 1963. One was Luz Marine Hernandez Salazar,
the only Costa Rican woman known to have been sent to Cuba for
training as a guerrilla warfere instructor, She had been in
Cuba since September 1962, The other Costa Rican passenger was
Carlos Guillen, former head of the Costa Rican Society of
Friends of the Cuban Revolution, who had been in Cuba since
November 1962.

controlling travel to and from Cuba and the Soviet bloc. The
activities of Cuban subversives in Reuador, at leact for the

present, have been greatly inhibited by the mass arrests of
Commumiste and pro-Cubans and by the outlawing of the Comuuist
Party by the junta.

It is reported that the Honduran Commmist Party has
iesued orders to ite members net to attempt to travel te Cuba
@t the present time, Thies setien is apparently the result of
the increasing vigilance of the Honduran goverment and the
greater implementation of stricter tvevel controls,

Castroist oxgenization directed from Cuba by John Williem Cooke,
hae in recent weeks been negotiating fer the purchase of ams

that the ANL was having difficulty getting enough dollare from
Cuba to make significant purchases possible,

August protested formally ta the Cuban Chargé d*Affaives in
La Paz against the Cuban Exbagsy support to the miners during
the recent ctisis, Subsequently, howaver, Foreign Minister
Fellman informed the Cuban Ghargé that he need nat fede that
the Goverument of Bolivia would break diplomatic relations with

Cuban Embassy with the preseat miafag crisis ia spite of sone
wneonfirmed reports of Cuban support.

Brazii

Cuban Ambassador to Brazil, Rawk Red Kourl, is reported
te have attempted to encourage peasant league leader francisco
Juliae te revitalize the lesgues im northern Brazil. According

is providing guidance and possibly financial support to the

ef pre-Castro guerrillas operating againet the Nicaraguan Govern- -
ment and active in the vicinity of the Nicaraguan-Honduxan border.
The Nicavaguan National Guard has bean conducting operations
on ite side of the border against the inaurgents since July.

The dense jungle and difficult terrain, however, will impede the
efforts of both forces to eliminate the guerriliag.

conflicting, It is apparently composed of members of the National |
Liberation Front (FLN), 2 Communist-deminated and Cuban-supported

Nicaragua since the fall of 1962. The strength of the force
is not known.
