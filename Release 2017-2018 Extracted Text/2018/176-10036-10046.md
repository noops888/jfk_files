Vienne; who defected to Spain, visited the Embassy July 17 and was

received by

and the reporting officer. Through

the Embassy had already received a report on a Spanish

police interrogation of Menendez, held & few days earlier.

Menender related that he had held his job in Vienna since November

1961 and that he had left on account of ideological incompatibility with

the Castro regime. He gave as the reason for his late defection, the faet

that he was trying to convince his wife to accompany him; she refused and,

as far as he knows, is still in Vienna and will return to Cuba.:

According: to Menendez, there remain three officers in the Cubar

Legation in Vienne, all of them thoroughly convinced commists.

Charge d'Affaires Amado PAINQUE, & Commnist theorist, was sent frui

javana to replace Fernando GAINZA, who also defected to Spain (See

Airgram 4-520)AkPrs. Pelenque is also accredited to the Austrian Governo

ment, and has the title of third Secretary. The third officer ia Roberte

FUHAR, First Secretary of legation, a forceful man of little education.

Menender considers Ire. Palengue very clever and thinks she really rune

the Off100. Described

as security-conscious, Mrs. Palenque has the keys

to the safe, handles all classified correspondence, and is not above

listening in on telephone conversations made through the Legation switch

board She is in charge of the two-key safe.

The only other Cuban Government employee residing in Vienns is Iuis

Ozlando RODRIGUEZ, Cuben Ambassador to the Atomic Energy Commission®

Kenendes, interestingly enough, described Rodriguez in terns similar to

those used by CAINZA during his interview with Embassy officers. Both of them

thought that Rodriguez was a decent fellow end an anti-comminist.. However, he

was in. 111 health and had a wife and a number of children, which made 1t difficult

for him to break with the Castro regime. Menendez expressed the opinion that

Rodriguez was saving some money to be prepared for the day when he receives

orders to return to Havans, at which time he would most likely disregard his

instruction and remain outside of Cuba. His wife is outspokenly anti-commnistic.

henendez described the legation as not being exactly a hotbed of activity..

Chores are minor and involve mainly contact with other bloc diplomatic repre-

sentatives and increasingly closer contact with the Austrian Commnist Party®

While under Gainza's regime locals were hired by the Legation; now they are taker

on only upon recommendation by the Austrian CP.

KOPINIG, FISCHUR end other Austrian Communist leaders were frequent visitors

to the Cuban legation, Menendez said, as was an Austrien newspaperman by the name

of Bruno FREY, who had lived some time in Mexico. Menendez believed that Frey

Lanes on the Cuban payroll, furnishing political information on the lustrian scene.

Frey's daughter, Flizabeth, was employed by the Legation as a receptionist.

Formerly, the Legation employed a Peruvian by the name of Dr. José CALDERÓN as

The Palenques live in the same building in which the

Menendes described his own work as insignificant, and said he was mainly

concerned with the monthly mailing of 2000 copies of a cultural magazine, which

was edited in Havans but translated into German by the Legation.

Additional copies

were given out by the legation to visitors. Moreover, he attended cultural

functions and lectured in Austrian institutes of higher learning on Cuba. Ee a130

technicians and interviewed Austrian technicians Interested in working in Cuba.

to classified infornation and said that Mrs. Palenque, who controlled the

safe was so careful, that he was not able to take any papers out when he defected.

He claimed to have had no knowledge of the intelligence and communications work

effected by the legation, although he said he was sure that they had no radio

equipment.

Pouches were delivered meekly to the Czech Embassy in Vienne for

transmittal to Prague and onward to Hevana, A Cuban diplomatic courier came

once

a month on a swing through the European capitals.

There was only one Cuban student in Austrie. He was David GARCIA Santamaria,

studying in Graz

In Menendez' opinion, Garcia was disillusioned with Castro

and would probably not return to Cuba.

A visitor frequently seen in the Legation was DOMINGUEZ (fnu), & Spanish exile,

who was active in the World Peace Organization. Menendez recalled also that

during the last fer months, he had seen three Americans at the legation. Ore was a

student, whon he characterized as & beatnik type who came with a girl, who

probably was also an American, inguiring about the possibility of obtaining a visa

for Cuba.

The second man, whose name he believed to have been Robert GOQD; came

five or six times in June.

He was also interested. in going to Cuba. He thought

that hir. Good was about 30 years old. Finally, about eight monthe ago a

Mr. PoPIra called at the Legation. Mr. Porter, who retured to the Legation in

June, claimed to be an ex-serviceman; to have been in the US Army and to have

participated in the Normandy landings. Porter described himself as a student of

history and sociology at the University of Vienna and asked for magazines and

books about present day. Cuba.

Menendez was reluctant to tell anything about his training for his job,

and clained

to have been instructed briefly in the Foreign Office by RUIZ DE VELASCO

on cultural

affairs.

He alleged that he received his position through a passing

soquaintence with Cuba's present Ambassador to Bolivia Roberto Aud, whom he

befriended during the Batista regime•

Comment:. From Menendez' story and the Spanish police report it appears that

hie motivation for defection was only in part-if at all-connected with his

ideological opposition to Castro. At the Legation, working as a receptionist-

typist was a Spanish girl, Matilde HERRERA, and it seems that Menendez got

emotionally involved with her, and when he received orders to return he abandoned

his wife and son and followed her to Spain, where she had gone a few days before

It would appear that Menendez had a more active part in the operation of the

Legation than he edmite, and at least in the times of Gainza had access to

classified material. This he plays down, because his stay in Spain depends on hi.

ability to convince the Spanish authorities that he had never been a Commmist and

that he is only a small fish.

Additional debriefing on some intelligence points

will be conducted through CAS channels.
