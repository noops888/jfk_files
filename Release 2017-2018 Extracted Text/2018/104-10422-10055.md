11 November 1975

Bob,

There are, in my mind, two distinct problems which have to be

addressed by the Task Force, These are (2) a final proofing Of the

sterile copy of the file, and (b) ensuring that the machine run accurate-

ly reflects what actions were taken with regard to full and partial

declassi fication.

In the case of the final prosfing only one person review the entire
ssnitzed file to ensure consistancy in the released product, eliminate
duolient2 materials and pick up any. errors “hich may have slipped past,

doe. crynts ete. This

long, perbars a day and should

: probably don view, {.e. not having done the declassific

i The secend proLlem may take more tims. It would be the reviewing of

each of the documents indicating whet declassification , if any was done

and accurately reflecting the action on tre machine run, The would be a
two man job. An ettendent srotlem would te indicating on the machine run
vt

enever duplicates tearing otter numbers azcear in the file. (In some

cases we have found two, three or more copies cf the same donument, bearing

j a different number, larded throughout the files.) A tertiary problem is the

marking on the machine run cases of drafts, research notes etc. My re-

commendation for this phase ‘ould be for # person from the Tesk Force,
familiar with files and the entire excercise work jointly with a person

from C/CI/ERO's office.
