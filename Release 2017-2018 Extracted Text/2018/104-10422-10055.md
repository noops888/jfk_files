Bob,

There are, in my mind, two distinct problems which have to be

aridressed hy tle Task Force. Tliese are (a) a final sroofing of the

sterile copy of the file, and (b) ensuring that the machine run accurate-

ly reflects what

actions were taken with regard to full and partial

declassification.

In the case of the final proofing only one person review the entire

sanitzed fila to ensure consistancy in tle released product, eliminate

duplicate naterials

and pick up any errors -lici: may

have slipped past,

I.to crypts etc. This should not take long, perhags a day and should

probably cone ly a person with a frest rier, i.e. not having done the declassific

The second problem may take more time. It would be the reviewing of

each of the documents indicating what declassification, if any was done

and accuratel: reflecting the action on tra mechine run. The would be a

two nan

job. An sitendent problem would ie indicating on

the machine run

¡enever duplicates hearing otter numbers appear in tie file. (In seme

cases we have found two, three or more copies of the same document, bearing

a different number, larded throughout the files. A tertiary problem is the

marking on the machine run cases of drafts, research notes etc. My re-

commendation for this

phase ould be for a person from the Task Force,

familiar with files and the entire excercise work jointly with a person

from C/CI/ERO's office.
