REF

Denver memorandum DEN-51-69, dated 1 February 1968, with attachment

dated 31 January 1968 and written by Don Jordan of the Denver Office.

The text of the memorandu needs no further explanation.

2. I made a cursory check with local sources who were unable to

confirm or deny the allegations made by Mrs. Margaret Fanning, nother

of Mies Clare Louise Panning who i8 currently a atudent at Seattle

University.

Since the matter is not cxactly in our ken 'and might be

of interest to the PBI I made a digest of the original memorandum and

ave a copy to the Seattle rol office.

A copy of. the digest was also

Iven to Mr.ll

of the digest is attached.

_ CIA. O/S, Seattle Resident Agent.

A copy

Seattle FBI Office said that they probably

will not

take any action but would pass the information along to their

headquarters in Washington DC. In all probability the information

will be attributed to the

Field Office.

3.

I made a further check with Colonel Michael J. Dolan, Place-

ment Officer, Seattle University, to determine

if he had heard

arything

about the subject matter on

_says that Colonel Dolan

can be trusted to be discreet in any dealings that we might have with

hin.

Colonel Dolan was unable to give me any information of a sub-

stantive nature regarding Subject but stated that Miss Panning 1&

having academic problems and her grade point has gone down steadily

since enrollment at Seattle University.

Her present courses are all

caught by laymen so 18 she has any contact with the Jesuit priests the

contact would be outside of the classroom. It was Colonel Dolan's

opinion that the university administration would be very interested in

running down information of the nature outlined by Mrs. Fanning.

Colonel Dolan has stated he will make some discreet inquiries without

implicating either Mrs. Or Miss Fanning.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

call fros Mis, Margaret Fanning Regarding Anti-CIA Activity

at the Univereity of Seattle

• 1. On 18 January 1968; 1100 hours, the Denver Office received a

call'on the listed number fron a woman who identified herself ae

Mrs. Margaret Fanning.

""Mrs. Janning stated that she lives In Pueblo

and that at the time of the call she was at Stapleton Airport enroute

to Texas.' Mrs. Fanning'e reason for calling us was her great concern

about what

her daughter, Clare, la being taught about the CIA and the

Kennedy assassinacion at the University of Seaccle shere Clare 18 a

etudent.

Mrs. Fanning has received several telephone calls recently

from Clare In which Clare Inforned her mother that sone of the prieste

at the University of Seattle (a Jeault school) had convinced the studenta

that Carrison's cheories about the assassination are correct and chat the

charges about the Agency's toplication are also correct.

3.

Mrs. Fanning stated that her daughter is accually afraid of che

CIA and considers that the CLA is comparable to the Gestapo. Mis. Fanning

acated that she tried to persuade Clare chat what she (the daughter) had

heard is totally untrue but Mrs. Fanning had no succesa whatsoever In

changing her daughter's viewpolnt.

Mrg. Fanning also atated that Clare asked her to be sure not

to repeat to anyone any of the foregoing Information and that the priests

at Seattle University had Inacructed their students not to discuss these

matters with their parents.

KIs. Fanning was obviously nost upset that

a faculty member at a univeralty, particularly a priest, had instructed

students not to discuss matters presented to chea at che school with their

parents.

In this connection, I suggested to Mrs. Fanning that she possibly

etter to the present on this particular item hat she sighe state

n this particular item

5. I also pointed out to her chat li there is in progress at the

Iniversity of Seattle activity shich could be construed as a ¿breat to

Internal securicy; the Fal would be

ppreciation for Mrs. Fanning'e concern about the misinioration on th

CIA which is apparently

being disseminated at the Univeralty of Seattle

but pointed out that there is very little we can do about such zatters.
