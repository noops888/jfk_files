Denver memorandum DEN-51-68, dated 1 February -1968, with attachment

.

1. You will find attached 4 copy of a Memorandum for the Record
dated 31 January 1968 and written by Don Jordan of the Denver Office.
The text of the memorandum.necds no further explanation,

2. 1 made a cursory check with local sources who were unable to
confirm or deny the allegations made by Mrs. Margaret Panning, mother
of Miss Clare Louise Fanning who is currently a atudefit at Seattle
University, Since the matter is not cxactly in our ken‘and might be
of interest to the PBI I riade a digest of the original memorandum and
gave a copy to the Seattle FBI Office. A copy of the digest was also
given to Mr. CIA 0/S, Seattle Resident Agent. A copy
of the digest is attached. Seattle FBI Office said that they probably
will not take any action but would pass the information along to their
headquarters in Washington DC, In atl probability the information
will be attributed to the Field Office.

3. I made a further check with Coloriel Michael J. Dolan, Place-
ment Officer, Seattle University, to determine if he had heard arything
about the subject matter on the campus. Colonel Dolan works with Mr.
CIA, OP/RD. Mr says that Colonel Dolan
Gan be trusted to be discreet in any dealings that we might have with
hia, Colonel Dolan was unable to give me any information of a sub-
stantive nature regarding Subject but stated that Miss Fanning is
having academic problems and her grade point has gone down steadily
ince enrollment at Seattle University. Her present courses are all
taught by laymen so if she has any contact with the Jesuit priests the
contact would be outside of the classroom. It was Colonel Dolan's
opinion that the university administration would be very interested in
running down information of the nature outlined by Mrs. Fanning.
Colonel Dolan has stated he will make some discreet inquiries without
juplicating either Mrs, or Hiss Fanning.

4. If ft {8 determined that there is any treth to the allegations
we Will be advised. We suspect, however, that Miss Fanning is fabri-
cating in order to cover up Ser poor academic progress.
