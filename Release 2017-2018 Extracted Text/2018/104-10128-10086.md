1, Reference is made to your memorandum dated 5 November 1951

requesting the permission be granted by this office so that the

Subject may take several training courses to be held in Building T-30

over the pertod from 15 November 1951 to 17 December 1954.

2. This 19 to advise that although this office interposes no

security objection to subject taking the proposed training to be held

in Bullding I-30, It la felt from a security standpoint that Subject's

presence at such courses may well create a security hazard that might

make 1t inadvisable to use Subject in sensitive operational activities

In the future.

3. For your information, Mr. John W. Belt, Security Office, Of Mca

of Training, has been orally advised of the decision of this office in

this matter.

Room 2605, Eye Building

Subject

: Nadelman, John D. (P)

#40696

1. Pursuant to conversation this date, it is requested that

subject be granted pernission to take two training courses, namely,

Operational Security Course (15 - 26 November) and Clandestine

Political Warfare Course (29 November - 17 December). These

courses are held in Building I-30.

2. As described in the memorandum from DD/P dated Il July

my every effort is being made to provide this individual with

a broad picture of the activities of this staff. It is believed

that these two courses will substantially assist in this educa-

tion. I permission is granted by your office, it will be neces-

Sary to change subject's Limited Badge to provide access to

Building T-30, in addition to Buildings I, J, K and I as presently

authorized.

3. As registration for the two courses is required very

soon, we urge immediate consideration of this request.
