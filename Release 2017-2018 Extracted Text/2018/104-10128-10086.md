1. Reference is made to your mamarandum dated 5 Novenber 195k
requesting the permission be granted by this office so that the
Subject may take several training courses to be held in Building 1-30
over the period from 15 November 195 to 17 Decaaber 195k.

2. this is to advise that although this office interposes no
security objection to Subject taking the proposed training to be held
in Building 1-30, 4t is felt from a security standpoint that Subject's
presence at such courses may well create a security hazard that might
make it inadvisable to use Subject in sensitive operational activities
in the future.

3. For your information, Mr, John W. Belt, Security Office, Office
of Training, has bean orally advised of the decision of this office in
this matter. :

Memorandum for: Chief, Special Security Division
Room 2605, Eye Building

Subject : Nadelman, John D. (P)
: #40696

1. Pursuant to conversation this date, it is requested that
subject be granted permission to take two training courses, namely,
Operational Security Course (15 - 26 November) and Clandestine
Political Warfare Course (29 November — 17 December). These
courses are held in Building T~30.

2. As described in the memorandum from DD/P dated 1h duly
195k, every effort is being made to provide this individual with
a broad picture of the activities of this staff. It is believed
that these two courses will substantially assist in this educa—
tion. If permission is granted by your office, it will be neces-
sary to change subject's Limited Badge to provide access to
Building T-30, in addition to Buildings I, J, K and L as presently
authorized.

3. As registration for the two courses is required very
soon, we urge immediate consideration of this request.
