Subject was in charge of the Parroll

at JuNIVE his performance was, in the rater's gninion,

not morc

than adequate?

He apparently

was of the opinior 4Mia"being in

charse of a

section ielleved him of the oncrous tasks of. filing

and other related duties of like

. nature.

As fai as meeting the

pay1011 deadlines Subject was proficient in this duty, but ho

nomally required considerable amount of overtime work to meet

these deadlines,

He had marg ideas which he presented to Chief,

Finance Branch

for betterment of the payrolling system, but un-

fortunately aftei due consideration the majority o. these ideas

were found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good

accepted commercinl practice or Agency regulations. Suggestions

made to hia were outwardly accepted bit upon follos-up it was

determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions.

Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject vas barely

adequate in performing his assigned tasks.

Subject is conscientious, Industrious, and willing to accept all

responsibility assigned him. He has performed his duties in a competent

manner and has shown a masked interest in learning all facets of his job.

Subject at times gives the impression (whether warranted or not) of being

uncertain in his thinking, and he does not always seem to erercischis

best judgment in reaching decisions, but he is striving to eradicate this

impression.

the: period Subject was in charge of the Payroll. Section

at NAVE his performance was, in the rater's gainion, not more

than adequate:

: He apparently was of the opinion

charge of a section relieved him of the onerous tasks of filing

and other related duties of like nature.

As far as neeting the

payroll deadlines Subject was proficient in this duts, but he

normally required considerable amount of overtime mork to meet

these deadlines

He had many ideas which he presented to Chief,

Finance Branch for bettermen't of the payrolling system, but un

fortunately after due consideration the majority of these ideas

were. found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good

accepted commercial practice or Agency regulations.

Suggestions

made to him were outridly accepted but upon follow-up it was

determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions.

Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject nas barely

adequate. in performing his assigned tasks.
