Room 602, The envelope was given to a bailiff introduced
as AL CYEENEY (phonetic). CERONE indicated to source
this was a monthly envelope and that if he got in trouble
he would arrange for his case to be brought before Judge
STARK,

Informant also advised the bookmaking operation
of JACK CERONE won $18,000 from customers placing sports
bets. Of this amount about $4,500 was from the Green Bay -
Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl contest. Source stated the
game closed with Kansas City a thirteen point underdog.

As all customers took Kansas City and Green Bay won thirty-
five to ten, all of the customers lost.

Informant has every reason to believe he will be
given a "good job" by CERONE if CERONE is satisfied with
his work.

As the Bureau is aware, both of these sources
have furnished information concerning gambling activities
of the SAM BATTAGLIA group in Melrose Park, Illinois.

As a result of this information, the following gambling
raids were made by state and county law enforcement offices
who received information concerning these activities from
the Chicago Office:

On the early morning of 1/16/67, RICHARD DERRICO,
one of the key operators, was observed entering the gambling
lotation at 2413 West Lake Street, Since this gambling
location is also a large scale horse and sports bookmaking
operation during the day, all information regarding this
location was furnished to Sergeant MICHAEL O'MARA, Cook
County Sheriff's Police, who raided premises at 1:00 p.m.
on 1/16/67, Entry was gained to the gambling room by
smashing through two front doors, one barricaded with two
reinforcement bars, revealing professional casino type
setup in back game room, including kidney shaped poker
table with elevated platform for dealer, smaller poker table,

Docld:32327177 Page 3


CG 137-4143

as well as professional cloth covers for tables. Arrested
was RICHARD JOSEPH DERRICO, who was charged as gambling
keeper. Confiscated were numerous race horse bet slips
recovered from DERRICO's person, as well as volumes of
other race horse and sports betting slips, scratch sheet:
ledger sheets used for pro football betting, sports parlay
cards, numerous decks of cards and dice, two poker tables
and miscellaneous gambling paraphernalia, all valued at
$2,000. DERRICO admitted to Bureau Agents gambling activities
as evidenced by bet slips found on his person but denied
large scale casino type operation at this location. No
indication of any interstate activity. Additional records
discovered at site of raid included names, addresses and
phone numbers of numerous hoodlums within SAM BATTAGLIA
group.

Sergeant O'MARA expressed great satisfaction over
results of raid, especially in view of the fact this was
the third successful gambling raid within city limits of
Melrose Park, Illinois, in the past three days. O'MARA
in news release gave the FBI credit for another significant
raid in hoodlum stronghold of BATTAGLIA group. :

Information regarding the GUY CERVONE gambling
operation at 2111 West Lake, Melrose Park, Illinois, was
furnished to JOSEPH WOODS, Cook County Sheriff, who at
11:30 p.m., 1/13/67, led a detail of his men. The raiding
party smashed through heavily barricaded rear and front
doors simultaneously to gazn entry to the first floor
premises. Individuals were observed gambling in two rooms.
Eleven persons were arrested including WILLIAM DEL PERCIO,
ELMER DEL PERCIO, GERALD NARGIE and ANGEL PACHECO, all of
whom are part of the SAM BATTAGLIA hoodlum gang. ELMER
DEL PERCIO was charged as gambling keeper. Over one
thousand dollars in cash, plus gambling paraphernalia
valued in excess of $3,000 was confiscated.

Information regarding the gambling operation at
Square Deal Auto Wreckers, owned by JOE DOM SCACCIA, was
furnished at 11:30 p.m., 1/13/67, to JOHN NEWBOLD, Chief of
Crime Section, Illinois Sheriff's Police, who led a raid
with his men on Square Deal. They smashed through the front
door to gain entry_to the gambling room located in the
center of a compostie structure, revealing plush gambling

Docld:32327177 Page 4


CG 137-4143

den with after hours bar, along with dozens of decks of

playing cards, card table, records of race horse bets, o
scratch sheets, slot machine, and miscellaneous gambling
paraphernalia, all valued at $1,000. SCACCIA was charged

as keeper of a gambling house, Four others on the scene

were released because of lack of evidence. Records seize

disclosed that this location obviously functioned as a

bookmaking operation during the day.

WOODS and NEWBOLD in news releases gave full
credit to the FBI for initiating a successful raid which
is receiving excellent coverage in the Chicago news media
due to notorious reputation of Melrose Park as a hoodlum imal
stronghold and this being the first raid conducted by
Sheriff Woops,

4, CG 6688-PC

On 1/16/67 informant advised that his business
had expanded at a faster rate than he anticipated, which
resulted in him becoming involved in a financial crises
to meet expansion needs, He said that his position was
such that unless he could come up with $15,000 immediately
business would fail. As a result, he got together with AL
WAINER, who has backed him financially in the past, who
took him to an individual informant did not name (however,
indicated to be "MILWAUKEE PHIL" ALDERISIO) to borrow the
$15,000 on "juice". Informant said that he figured that it
would be a very short term loan and that while he knew it
was poor judgment on his part to become so involved, he
felt that it was the best way to overcome his difficulty.
He went on to say that almost immediately thereafter, the .
person who lent him the money demanded a share of the
business. Informant claims that he became very distressed
over his situation and actually contemplated going on a
"score" in an effort to raise the money in order to pay the
$15,000 debt. He then got together with JIMMY CATUARA
and the two of them went to see the individual. Informant
demanded to be released from the obligation which resulted
in a violent argument. The person picked up a chair and
threatened to hit the informant with it. After an exchange

Docld:32327177 Page 5


CG 137-4143

of threats, the informant left and contacted other friends
of his high in the syndicate. Informant claims that he

is in the process of settling the matter although he is
paying two per cent weekly on the loan of $15,000; however,
he expects to get the full $15,000 paid by approximately
1/20/67, at which time he will be released from this
obligation.

Informant advised that prior to the time he went
into prison, he had been operating a "juice" venture backed
by AL WAINER, He said that they lost approximately $80,000
in this venture. He explained that because he had to go
to prison, he was unable to enforce collections and the
people that were supposed to take care of the collections
for him failed him. He said that GUS RU¥INO took him for
$10,000, He said that he had collected some of the money
including a large amount from "NICK THE GREEK" (believed
to be NICK KOKENAS). He added that he took MARSHALL
CAIFANO with him to see NICK, which resulted in NICK paying
up. :

5. CG 7049-PC

Informant mentioned that "TEETS" BATTAGLIA is
now the real boss of the outfit. He described him as the
"tightest guy" he has ever come across, Informant said
BATTAGLIA is "loaded" and yet about three weeks ago he
chased a small time gambler half way through Melrose Park
and beat the guy up just because he owed him $320. He
said BATTAGLIA watches all gambling games in this area very
close and nobody gets away with anything. He said that he
is also a great guy to utilize free labor on his farm.
There are always small time hoods who are looking for favors
and trying to get in good with BATTAGLIA. He said these
punks often get "Sucked" into performing sizeable jobs
for BATTAGLIA, thinking that they are going to gain his
favor. . Informant said none of these guys are ever recognized
by BATTAGLIA, who regards them as "dopes", Informant said
BATTAGLIA chooses to avoid any publicity, and since
GIANCANA fled to Mexico and wants out of the organization,
BATTAGLIA knows any heat will be focused on him. BATTAGLIA
goes out of his way to keep his name from being used. He

Docld:32327177 Page 6


0 8g

CG 137-4143

also dislikes being used as an arbiter in an argument.
Whenever there is trouble between some members of the
outfit, they are steered to NICK PALERMO and CHARLES
NICOLETTI, who generally settle the dispute without any
further reference to BATTAGLIA,.

BATTAGLIA's chauffeur, "JOSE", is also rising
in the outfit in the western suburbs, and like JOHN
TARRARA (phonetic) is a coming member of the top circle
in the Melrose Park area. TARRARA got his clout from his
prior association with "PAUL THE WAITER" RICCA. BOBBY
DOER is also a leading syndicate hoodlum and in control
of several profitable enterprises for the outfit in the
western suburban area,

The Charm Club, which had been controlled by
DOER, has been closed and operations are moving from this
site to the Old Chicken House on North Avenue in Melrose
Park, This place has been remodeled and is now called
the Country Pub. They are having a grand opening 1/19 or
20/67, and no doubt this will become a hangout for syndicate
members, While this place was being remodeled, BOBBY DOER
was constantly checking on its progress. It has become
known that once operations start at the Country Pub, DOER
will be in complete control and probably will use this as
his hangout.

Informant said that discussions among members
of the syndicate concerning JOE SHINE are amusing. Some
say he is being persecuted and others say he is nothing but
a "stupe!. The outfit, according to one source, would like
to "throw him a bone", but every time he shows up with
something the "Government" is on top of him. Ina recent
discussion by several local characters concerning SHINE,
it was said that SHINE has no future in the Melrose Park
area and the outfit cannot see where he can fit in. . They
also plan to do nothing about it.

Word has gotten around town that the syndicate
has given up on Strangers in the Night. Word has gotten
around to sell the club building and all, and salvage what
they can. There have been no offers coming to informant 's
attention, but the building has been observed by informant

Docld:32327177 Page 7



CG 137-4143

daily and appears to be abandoned, Informant said the
syndicate has a quarter of a million dollars standing in
that building and it is costing them money everyday,

The informant said Mayor, RSON is jin Florida
and would like to stay in Flori wo remaining
years expire as Mayor of Melrose Park, {es SON wants
“out" the worst Way but the outfit has@t! him that he
has enjoyed their profits and he can stick with their
troubles until his term runs out. His probabl uccessor
from talk around Melrose Park is Attorney. LOUIS\NTCHOLS. fh Lawn C

Informant stated that one of the most profitable
deals involving the police and a few politicians at the
present time is a judicial setup at Oak Park, Illinois.
Informant stated under the new judicial system the magistrate
court in Oak Park handles all cases from a number of
surrounding towns, including Melrose Park. Whenever a
felony charge is brought to the attention of the judge
and states attorney in charge of this court, a lot of
wheeling and dealing goes on, The judge's name was recalled
as CONFIST (phonetic), and the states attorney's name is
ROMAN. Wherever these two can do it, they will attempt to
reduce a felony charge to a misdemeanor and shake down the
defendants involved, This is generally done through the
attorney representing the defendant. The informant said
that one police officer told him the only way he could be
sure that a felony rap would be approved by the Oak Park
Court and sent to the Grand Jury at 26th and California
was to threaten ROMAN or the judge with publicity. This
police officer also told him the only other way it has
worked to satisfaction is for the police officer to tell
ROMAN or the judge that he has a personal interest in this
case and plead that it be presented to the Grand Jury for
indictment. If ROMAN or the judge feel there will be any
trouble, they will avert this,

Informant said concerning recent robberies in
the area, namely the robbery of a National Tea Store on
West Madison Street in Chicago and the Armored Express job
at North Riverside, Illinois, that the individuals involved
could well be part of the six member gang that hit the

Docld:32327177 Page 8


CG 137-4143

U. S. Bargain Town Center in Melrose Park. These
individuals were named as; :

JOSEPH LOMBARDI, JR.
MARIO DE ANGELIS
FRANK DE ROSA, JR,
GUY CERVONE

JOHN DE MARIA
ANTHONY SCUDIERO

One of the reasons informant suspects these
individuals is that he has received word that they are
very active and that they are doing so with the full
cooperation and consent of BOBBY DOER. From his personal
knowledge, informant said, he knows that LOMBARDI .and
DE ANGELIS are loaded with money and are spreading it
all over. He has seen them in frequent contact with DOER
in recent weeks, and DOER.has: continually made a check
through a police department contact known to the informant
concerning the above individuals to see if any "heat" is
on them. Informant said that his contact on the police
department was discussing the activity of these men, that
they were making money, that the modus operandi used at
the National Tea Store was similar to the U. S. Bargain
Town in Melrose Park, and that if there was a weak link
in this gang it was FRANK DE ROSA, JR, Informant said
that if this police officer from the Melrose Park Police
Department is on the level, he will grab DE ROSA and try
and break him down, However, informant said this is hardly
possible as no police officer can do this on his own in
Melrose Park.

Informant stated that the word has gotten around
that BOBBY DOER has to clear any holdup activity in the
Melrose Park area. f

Informant stated that a week or two ago he was
having coffee in a restaurant on Mannheim Road. He noticed
in the restaurant several guys, holdup men and burglars,
and they were talking in "Swearing" terms about "THE GREEK",
He overhead their discussion and heard them use the name
SCHANG. He then realized that they were talking about
PAT SCHANG, whom they consider to be a possible Government

witness in the case involving WILLIE DADDANO, JOHN VARELLI,
ROCKY INFELICE, MIKE D'ALESSIO, all top hoodlums, and
other hoodlums involved in a federal indictment charging
them with the theft of silver and photographic material
from interstate shipments (Chicago files 15-26351,
15-26968, 15-26263 and 15-25085). Informant gathered

from listening to these "characters" that any one of them
would do anything possible to locate SCHANG and kill him.
It was informant's opinion that there is no contract le
out, as such, Informant said, however, that it is unders
by all members of the criminal outfit not only in Melrose
Park but anywhere in this area, that there is a good price
on SCHANG's head, that anyone able to do anything about
SCHANG's demise would be well rewarded, and that there is
no doubt that efforts are being made by any number of
individuals on their own and collectibly to find SCHANG
and kill him.

‘ood

Informant stated that he has heard from some
individuals that if SCHANG is caught, he will not be given
the benefit of a quick demise, The individuals discussing
SCHANG said that they would return him to this area and
torture him to death, thereby making an example of him,
Informant stated that from his own knowledge and discussion
with "these people", they have definitely been hurt by
the breaking up of the silver hijacking gang, which
resulted in the indictment of eighteen individuals actively
engaged in criminal activities in the Chicago area. He
stated that the crushing blow concerning criminal activity
was the arrest of WILLIE DADDANO, who was regarded as
untouchable. Informant stated this seemed to shake their
confidence, and where there had been hijackings, robberies,
and wholesale thefts on a weekly basis prior to this whole-
sale arrest, activity has slowed down to an occasional job.
Informant stated that should any information come to his
attention concerning inquiries on PAT SCHANG, he will so «
advise. One person contacted on this matter by informant
said he had heard SCHANG was "on the street and in some
town in Wisconsin", Informant stated SCHANG's whereabouts
is of daily concern to a number of individuals.

On 1/16/67 informant was discussing "MILWAUKEE
PHIL" ALDERISIO. He stated that he had known ALDERISIO
for many years. He went on to say that it was a mystery
to him how ALDERISIO ever advanced in the criminal
organization in Chicago. He said that ALDERISIO is an
uncouth, savage, rough individual, whom he considers
anything but brilliant. He.said, however, that apparently
ALDERISIO either has a lot of money himself at the present
time, or is being backed by people who do. He mentioned
that he had seen ALDERISIO in recent months and that
ALDERISIO had offered to invest money with the informant
in any type venture the informant desired, (It is to be
noted that the informant is a man of considerable wealth.)
Informant told ALDERISIO that he would not be interested.
Informant stated that ALDERISIO told him that he was
desirous of putting his money into legitimate enterprises,
Informant said that it is his opinion that the outfit
would have no control over money invested by ALDERISIO
and it was strictly his own undertaking. He pointed out
that since the decline of prostitution, other vice and
gambling, that apparently members of the outfit are more
or less operating on their own and trying to make it
legitimate. He said in the old days it was easy for them
to muscle in on gambling and other illegitimate operations
and the money derived from these activities would go back
into the syndicate.

Informant stated it appeared to him that MARSHALL
KORSHAK was a cinch to be elected Treasurer of the City
of Chicago. He said that although he had given a party for
KORSHAK for fund raising purposes during the recent
election, he did not intend to do it during this contest.

Informant displayed a silver star that he had
pinned to his billfold. The star represented him as an
investigator for the Illinois State Legislature, He said
that he had received this star from someone presently in
the Legislature that he helped elect.

Informant advised on 1/13/67 that-GHARLES—
/-SIBAGUSA,aeformer Chief of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics,
lew York, and currently Director of the Illinois Crime

‘Comission, State of Illinois, approached JOHN D'ARCO,
former Alderman, lst Ward, Chicago, incumbent Ward
Committeeman, and alleged "tool" of the Chicago crime
Syndicate, requesting his approval, sanction, and backing
for SIRAGUSA‘'s candidacy as 1st Ward Alderman in the
forth coming Aldermanic election in Chicago.

D‘ARCO reportedly contacted unidentified persons
and told SIRAGUSA that he would not be considered as an
Aldermanic candidate and strongly advised against his
filing.

It is noted that the incumbent Ist Ward
Alderman DON PARILLO has again filed his petition and will
run. SIRAGUSA did not file.

former Chief Investigator, Cook C
telephonically contacted RICHARD B
employer, now President, Cook-Count:
and advised he had ju just returned to
trip "to San Francisco". CAIN stated he wanted to meet -
with OGILVIE 1/13/67 on a very important ma
OGILVIE refused to meet with CAIN, CAIN told
important for the Republican Party that JO)
Republican candidate for Mayor, Chicago, in touch

with CAIN, since CAIN has important information which / ie
WANER can use to defeat Mayor RICHARD J, DALEY. CAIN: =
indicated he wanted to "trade" the information for "a favor".

Since it is known that CAIN has just returned
from a stay with GIANCANA in Mexico, it is possible that
he is carrying a message regarding a bribe to be used
by WANER for campaign purposes or does, in fact, have
information given him by GIANCANA which can be used against

enseas bs eee

Docld:32327177 Page 12


CG 137-4143

DALEY. In any event, it would definitely appear CAIN is
performing a task for the Chicago hoodlum group. Attention
in this regard is directed to information provided by a
confidential source that Chicago group through intermediary
offered campaign funds to BENJAMIN ADAMOWSKI when he ran ,
for Mayor against DALEY. It is also noted that since it is
known CAIN recently associating with PETER GRANATA, tool
of Chicago group in Illinois Legislature, he may be being
used in political area by the Chicago group.

CAIN is known to have been divorced by his
Mexican wife and now living with HARRIET BLAKE, singer who
appeared some time ago at the College Inn of the Sherman
House. Number furnished by CTE (Former) where CAIN can
be reached 1/13/67, is listed to HARRIET BLAKE, 5436 North
Central Avenue, Chicago.

CTE (Former) advised that ANTHONY G, GIROLAMI,
Democratic Ward Committeeman, 28th Ward, Chicago, finds
himself in a poor position in that his protege, ANGELO
PROVENZANO, present Alderman, has refused to run for
re-election. Chicago hoodlum group instrumental in having
JOSEPH JAMBRONE file for that Aldermanic office. JAMBRONE's
connections with the Chicago group is so well known in the
28th Ward that no candidate could be found to run against
him except three Negroes. As a result, JAMBRONE is a
definite favorite to win. GIROLAMI feels this will be
a blow against law enforcement in view of JAMBRONE's obvious
close association with such highly placed Chicago hoodlums
as JACK CERONE, JOSEPH GAGLIANO and WILLIAM MESSINA, On
the other hand, GIROLAMI will lose face with Mayor DALEY
and lose power in the Ward if a Negro candidate should beat
JAMBRONE. GIROLAMI's recourse is to "drag feet" while
pretending to assist JAMBRONE‘s campaign.

B. Penetration of the LCN

1. CG 6933-C-TE

Informant advised he visited ROCCO PRANNO,
prominent Chicago hoodlum presently confined in
Federal Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana, on 1/15/67,
with Mrs. PRANNO. PRANNO, who was confined with GIANCANA
in Cook County Jail when GIANCANA was released 5/31/66,
told CTE that GIANCANA is completely disgusted with his
circumstances at time of release, PRANNO related
GIANCANA‘s morale completely shattered, and GIANCANA told
him he intended to completely disassociate himself from
organized crime and "go to an island and relax for the
rest of his life", PRANNO stated GIANCANA is convinced
the Government would call him back before the Federal
Grand Jury and continue intensive efforts to reconfine
him. PRANNO told CTE that GIANCANA felt the Government
would always focus primary investigative efforts on
the leader of organized crime and GIANCANA did not desire
to spend any more time in confinement. GIANCANA made
obscene comments about his associates and stated he
intended to "Leave everything behind. They can have
everything I got."

PRANNO informed CTE that the feeling is that
GIANCANA may have "flipped" over to the side of the FBI
upon his release, since GIANCANA has not been subpoenaed
back before the Federal Grand Jury or in any other way
subjected to any type of prosecutive action. PRANNO feels
GIANCANA must..have made some type of "deal" with the
Government in return for this consideration.

PRANNO told the informant that when GIANCANA
left the County Jail, he gave PRANNO his watch and ring.
PRANNO said that when he arrived at the Terre Haute
Penitentiary, he was wearing the wristwatch, which was
contrary to prison rules. Immediately, other inmates
"beefed", ,claiming that because PRANNO was a top syndicate
man from Chicago, he could get special privileges, The
wristwatch was taken. away from PRANNO. PRANNO told the
informant that it had been difficult for him to overcome

~ 13 =

Docld:32327177 Page 14


CG 137-4143

the reputation that he has in the penitentiary. Because

he is considered to be a Chicago syndicate figure, many

of the inmates have attempted to surround him, do special
favors and so forth. This includes Doctor BRUNI, who
allegedly has syndicate connections in Chicago. PRANNO
told him that such attention works to his disadvantage

and causes prison officials to keep a closer watch on him.
At the present time PRANNO'’s main contacts are a couple

of minor hoodlums who are in Terre Haute on lesser charges.

PRANNO told the informant that he is thoroughly
disgusted with his attorney, RICHARD DEVINE. He stated
emphatically to the informant that he was "sold out by his
own people", DEVINE's services were arranged for by
"MILWAUKEE PHIL" ALDERISIO. PRANNO told the informant
that after he was sentenced to fifteen years, he threatened
DEVINE that he would kill him.and told him that he had done
the job of a fourteen year old kid, He further told DEVINE
that on appeal matters he intended to have a stenographer
in court so he could be sure of what DEVINE said and
cautioned him that it had better be right.

In the presence of the informant, Mrs, PRANNO
told her husband that MIKE MARINO had been visiting her
quite often and seemingly asking questions concerning
PRANNO which aroused her suspicions. (It is to be noted
that CG 6933-C-TE has advised that it is his opinion that
MARINO is acting as a scout for the outfit relative to
PRANNO.) PRANNO told his wife that the next time MARINO
showed up, she should spit in his face and tell him that he
told her to do it.

PRANNO told the informant that he was aware of
that fact that JOE SHINE was getting into trouble with the
Government. He said the outfit is doing the same to SHINE
that they did to him. He said further that he understands
the "beefers" for the Government in this case are SEIDLER,
BILL DE VITTO, and the contractor. Although PRANNO hates
SHINE, he declared that he would never testify against him
and said that if he gets involved in the matter he is going
to take the 5th Amendment.

Informant saw Doctor BRUNI at the penitentiary
briefly. He said that BRUNI seems quite broken up and
PRANNO told him that BRUNI's wife did not visit him as
much as she could and this was a mental strain on him.

He also saw TONY D'ANTONIO and stated that apparently
D'ANTONIO is almost completely "cracked up". PRANNO

told him that it is expected that D'ANTONIO will be

On 1/19/67 the wife of CG 7090-PC stated she
recently made a trip to visit her husband. She was
accompanied on this trip by TONY AMATORE, a very close
friend of her husband. She stated her husband seemed in
good spirits and was very well satisfied with his contact
with the two Bureau Agents and also with the arrangements
made at that time for the interview. She stated, however,
he was apprehensive about subsequent contacts at this
institution, but related that he would leave this up to the
good judgment of the Agents.

CG 7090-PC, according to his wife, is anxious
for his attorney, RICHARD DEVINE, to go ahead with his
appeal of the case and the appeal bond. She stated that =
on this date she had been in contact with their attorney;
DEVINE, and he shewed her papers which he had drawn up
concerning the appeal bond, and DEVINE assured her that
on 1/20/67 he would file the appeal bond in the Federal
Court at Chicago. She stated that her husband was anxious
to be released on the appeal bond and could not see any
reason why this appeal should not be approved by the
Appellate Court. She said her husband had given the two e!
Bureau Agents nicknames and referred to them in his
correspondence as FRED and MEL. Ina letter received
within the past few days, her husband had indicated his
desire to be released on the appeal bond and according to
his letter he stated, "I wish MEL will help.for I think I.
can help him later," She stated this was a key phrase
to indicate that if Bureau Agents could assist in the
matter of the bond, it would meet with his approval. It
is to be noted that when interviewed personally by Bureau

Agents, CG 7090-PC had stated that he did not want anything
out of the way to occur to arouse suspicions among the
"outfit" that would indicate any cooperation on his part
with authorities concerning his release. He was given
assurance at this time that nothing would be done by the
Bureau Agents along this line which did not meet with his
approval. The wife of CG 7090-PC stated that Attorney
DEVINE was of the opinion that the Appellate Court could
not turn down this appeal in view of their recent decision
concerning the release of PAUL PANCZKO, a notorious thief
who was released under a similar set of circumstances by
the Appellate Court, She stated that she did not know
what assistance her husband could give Bureau Agents, but
he had assured her verbally and in writing that he would
cooperate to any extent he could short of testifying in
court.
