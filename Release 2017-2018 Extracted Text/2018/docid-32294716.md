A review of Pittsburgh files, under captioned
matter, as well as report supplied by the New York
Office, reflect the following information:

Membership im the Pittsburgh criminal
organization (family) is based primarily upon information
furnished by former PCI JOSEPH MEROLA (recently released from
the Federal Correctional Institution, Jacksonville, Fla.,
and presently located Miami, Florida}, also PG 640-CTE.
Although these sources have been closely associated with
SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA and SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO,
alleged heads of the criminal organization in the
Pittsburgh area, they are not member-sources of "Causa
Nostra" or even the Pittsburgh criminal organization;
therefore, they ‘are not in a position to identify members
of this organization. Both, in fact, cannot positively
identify the head of the Pittsburgh criminal organization,
but believe that leadership is vested in SEBASTIAN JOHN
LA ROCCA although they indicate ‘that leadership could
possibly be vested in SAMUBTMANNARINO, GABRIEL MANNARINO
with FRANKSAMATO and MICHAEL GENOVESE being given certain
considerations. These sources ‘have stated that members
of the Pittsburgh criminal organization are believed to
include JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA, ANTONIO RIPEPI, JO JO
PECORA, ANTHONY "TONY" GROSSO, LOUIS VOLPE, FRANK VALENTI,
JOSEPH SICA and THOMAS ANTHONY CIANCUTTI in addition
to the above-mentioned leadership including SEBASTIAN JOHN f
LA ROCCA, SAMUEL MANNARINO, GABRIEL MANNARINO, FRANK AMATO Noy
and MICHAEL GENOEESE, J

member~sources of the Pittsburgh criminal organization.
These sources, however, consider ANTHONY "TONY" GROSSO
as strictly a large independent numbers man who has
been able to maintain independence from the LA ROCCA -
MANNARINO group.

NY T-1 (idntified in New York report dated
12/19/62) states there are approximately 10 "families"
in "Causa Nostra" outside the New York area. NY T-1
named specific cities which did not include Pittsburgh.
: Pittsburgh has previously prepared Anti-
Racketeering reports on all individuals mentioned above
as possible members of the Pittsburgh criminal organization
except for JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA, JO JO PECORA and
THOMAS ANTHONY CIANCUTTI.

In view of the fact that JOHN CHRISTOPHER
FONTANA, JO JO PECORA and THOMAS ANTHONY CIANCUTTI
have been identified as members only by former PCI
JOSEPH MEROLA, a non-member - source, reports are not
being submitted on the latter three individuals. It is
to be noted, however, that information has been developed
and reported in reference to FONTANA, PECORA and
CIANCUTTI in connection with Pittsburgh cases entitled,
“SAMUEL, MANNARINO, AR"; "GABRIEL MANNARINO, AR," with whom
they are associated. :

Investigation is continuing to develop a
member-source that can definitely identify members of
the Pittsburgh criminal organization.
