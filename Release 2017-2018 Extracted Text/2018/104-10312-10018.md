Mr. Lawrence Houston is in constant touch
‘with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General,

yee Nathaniel Cossack, on this matter, and will

tell him about present developments.

Fe ae Mr. Houston comments that anyone could
have prepared the letter but it really does
sound like NOVEL's cock-eyed approach rather
than Garrison, There is a fair chance that



NOVEL might have written it. ‘This will probably
make another headline for Garrison but we
don't feel it could do the Agency much damage",

4. On the question of the alleged gunshot fired at NOVEL,
Mr. Papich advised that the FBI is not investigating the matter,
It has not been confirmed as yet that anyone did shoot at NOVEL.
