ened that he was on the way to a recruitment pitch. Horever, since that

late he has eased off the derogatory comments about.

If he had an aside moone

before 23 July, he has not ralood them since in his conversations with her.

Golub must raalize by this time that an out and out cold recruitment pitch to

02|115 would be futile. Even though liberal minded, As}s in their discussione

has been oritical of the Soviet syaten and has strenuoualy defended capitalis.

If he la attempting to get her Involved in a romantic relationship whereby

he could exercise some emotional control, he has mored very along As ve

have stressed before, he has not made one romantie overture to her. If he

did, he would be most definitely rebuffed.

We do not want to turn this

Into « "Dear Abby" letter, but feel that Golub may be suffering from a

father complex. Golub and his wife have been unable to have children, and

ho has mentioned that he would desperately like to. Whenever he talke about

this he becomes noticeably distressed.

Golub appeara to be attracted to

younger people.

This was the case with his former assistant in the Soviet

Consulate here, Mikhall Lyubinor, who was a young, intelligent, cultured

Soviet. Golub frequently refers to Lyubinov mentioning how much he liked

him, what good friends they were, and how much he misses him, Goluba

attraction toAE'5 started when Lyubimor left. So given what we know about

Golub'o personality, we do not think it too strange that he "likes hor for

her mind," We admit. that if Golub had the opportunity he rould certainly

attenot a recruitment or some other form of embarrasement; bat we alao believe

that his feelings are such toward AyS that he would continue seeing AF502

long after his operational interest had died down.

We have not forgotten

the fact that Golub is a shred Intelligence operator. From the outset.of

02the Ar) 5 Colub contact, ve instructed her to use extreme caution,

that Golub

was hore than a Consul, and that behind this friendly and gregarious nature,

there was a calculating, diabolical individual, and that she should at all ..

costs avoid letting herself be put in the position where she would be suf

captible to any form of blacinall. She was told that above all she should

o nothing to indicate to Golub any contact with any merdean official

ecause of this we have rebreined from giving 115 en Frequirecta &

olfeit from Golub bellering that personality data would just come out

naturally. We have never givert 425 any canned responses to political

questions that Golub might raise feeling that she ma clever and vell-rea

enough to answer on her ons. He did not, want to give Golub any impresaion

that she was being briefed on what to say and to aske.
