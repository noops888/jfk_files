1963.

b. Increased its, efforts designed to contrdl the move-
ment of persons, arms and propaganda materials to and
from Cuba. A summary of actions by country is. provided
below:

1) Argentina ~ Station, in.conjunction with the
Embassy, has. continued to press the Argentine govern:
merit to enact’ effective travel control legislation
and to. adopt measures recommended. by the Special
Security. Committee of. the OAS, Information on
Argentines travelling to Cuba.is being furnished to
the Argentine government. by, the station, Several
potential travellers to Cuba. have been spotted and
are being-assessed.by the station. “Information from
three recent returnees from Cuba is being obtained
through debriefings. Station reports that because of
inereased Mexican controls, all. truly clandestine
travel. to Cuba from Argentina is now via Prague. Che
Guevara's. mother.was arrested on 23 April upon her
return.to Argentina for importing Castro propaganda.

2) Bolivia - Station and Embassy have been urging
Bolivian government to adopt stricter travel controls,
without apparent results so far, Names of travellers
known to have returned from Cuba are being furnddhed
to the Bolivian government. Thus far, no action ig
known to have been taken by the Bolivian government. on
the strength of such information! Station comments. that.
problem with Bolivia is not in lack of information
available to government on Cuban subversion, but in

getting Bolivia to do something about it.

3) Brazil - Information on Brazilians who have
received subversive training in Cuba has been made
available to the Brazilian Foreign Office, through. the
American Ambassador, and tothe National Security
Council through CIA liaison with the NSC's Security
Service.

An asset of the CIA station in Rio is ina position
to harass and delay Cuba-bound travellers in those
instances where the Station is able to tip him off
regarding. their. destination, He can also harass
returnees when informed in advance, The Station is
taking steps to get appropriate information to him
promptly.

4) Chile - Chilean internal security authorities,
at urging of station, are trying to.impéde and harass
travellers to and from Cuba. ‘Government is now requiring
passport applicants to state destination, and passports
must be turned in after travel. The Foreign Minister
has stated much progress is being made, with cooperation
of the Mexican government, and that travel of Chileans to
Cuba has. been dramatically reduced in recent.weeks.
Station and. Embassy are continuing pressure on Cuban
government in this regard. Names of travellers to Cuba
are being passed to the Ambassador, who furnishes them
to President Alessandri (who has asked that this collab-
oration:be kept secret), Information from CIA unilateral

operations against Cuban Embassy is being used by a newly

created. Chilean surveillance team in checking out purpose

of travel projected. and in following up on returnees from

Cuba for training and intelligence missions. A Cuban
First Secretary was declared personal non grata during
April. for using false identity documents, and the Cuban
charge d'affaires was subsequently recalled by his own
government.

5) Colombia - Chief of Customs has indicated to station
his willingness to institute an improved travel. control
system... One station asset expects to travel to Cuba
in the near future. Station believes it has identified
a courier operating between Colombia and Cuba and has
mounted an operation to uncover his Colombian contacts.

6) Costa Rica - Station reports little pro-Castro

7) Dominican Republic - Efforts to get Juan Bosch to
take active steps against Communists and travellers to
and from Cuba have been fruitless to date, as have been
efforts to.establish a new and effective internal security
organization in’ the Dominican Republic. Bosch appears
to have lost his previously stated enthusiasm for such
a service, but efforts to persuade him to approve a
proposed budget for the service are continuing. ~
