SUBJECT: Gunn request re Angleton

I spoke with Jeremy - he will be coming to HOS tentatively next week to look at Scott documents. As you will recall, he also requested
to look at Angelton documents or destruction records of Angelton documents. - As the DO previously informed OGC in the Scott case,
Angelton documents were either incorporated into the DO records or were destroyed. {s there any way that the 00 can search its
records systems so that it would locate any destruction records on Angelton files??? if this is possible, | would appreciate it if you could.
send me copies for Jeremy's review next week. i

ae
A second request he made was if he could see the copies of documents we released to FOIA requestar Tom Mangold (the unrddacted
versions). Since these files are also sitting in my office, 1 suggest that ! make these available to him when he comes to see the Scott files.
Let me know if this is OK with the DO. Of course, | would only show him CIA documents and not any documents referred to us from FBI
(which is the majority of our Mangold file).
