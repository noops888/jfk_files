He comments that he is working for ELIZABuL

and

asks if it is the same job. He says it is-same

stuff--but that work would run out pretty soon, that

he would thereafter work a little while "at a printer's..

CHARLES says they got that info. by letter and asks

how about his coming here for Christmas.

He says he still

does not know what is going to happen, adding that he is

"still hung up. on CHLOE," that he is calling from the

" (IFAN and children). He mentions having talked

with DENNIS several times recently.: CS says they just

heard from DENNIS that he had won"a second prize in

poetry translation," for which he received twenty dollars.

Cs inquires with regard to the "guy you're consulating...

is he any help?"

comments that it helps "off and

on" and BS asks if he's sticking with it... "Your therapy."

He says he is. She urges him to give therapy a chance.

He says it has helped some, adding that he had cried

in two out of the four sessions; that he thinks the guy

is great; that he was just sort of lonesome for CHLOE;

that analyst feels that "I have kind of dammed up and

blocked up a lot of emotion which was giving me other

kinds of mental problems," that he has helped some; that

If he does not come for Christmas, he will probably come

down around New Year's or shortly thereafter.

Say DENNIS is expected to arrive here around 16th December

_says he has had some

"down periods" and some 'up

periods."

BS asks if he is able to function and he

replies "Off and on," that at times he feels frustrated.
