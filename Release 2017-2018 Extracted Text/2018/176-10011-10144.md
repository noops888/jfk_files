"Positive action would consist resumption infiltration

activities. This connection wish point out all teams currently

scheduled for infil are trained assets which WAVE has been

developing since March 1962. As you well know this large

backlog of assets has accumulated because CIA maritime

assets have been totally incapable infiltrating these teams

at rate commensurate with speed at which teams were

developed to maturity and readiness for on target ops assign-

ments.

We are therefore not advocating mass infiltration

of ill prepared and untrained people.

These teams are as

good as our current system can produce. Despite this

sound preparation infiltration at this time will produce
