a)

(Bpril 1947) (ey Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
CE

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Reagan
exploit leads from the Soviet Fnbassy, This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of milti line phone taps,(three photo sites, )a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Fhone taps were pleced by ah ‘Siployes | Leyes of 3 ‘Sf the telephone company

ota Ca
tho _waS handled by peyta WILSTED (pseudo). The number of Lines

tapped was linked by availability of a listening post nearty
(since the taps were not made in thé main central) end English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related
(uhich' the station et that tine felt ves good security in that

if. they telked about’shop, they would talk to each other.)

b ‘ee photo sites/were handled by Anderson with the kelp

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) end TDY ISD
people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices, These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALLA). _ LIMITED was a fixed site opposite across

the street from the front. ga’ te of: tHe | Soviet Enbassy which, had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was on the

tkat block, LIMITED was che first base and it operated strictly on an

stcl basis in the early steges. I think the Hexi Station bought
one storey

this property (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart, This base was closed when

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the

pudlic by the Warren Cosmission. The photo operators were moved to another apt

neerby. The property vas sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of 2 new apartment blding to be built

on this site). © LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED,

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor ~check) on the sane side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy, The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Mexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Exbassy compound
which the Mexico Stetion purckased in about 1958 (check date), also using :
LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of eS
the Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (10 at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Stetion records), The three photo sites were handled by

and LILYRIC three times a week. His sister's husband, Carlos

Yahoney using HQ TDY teams for monitoring. This operation vas also separate

from LICALLA, The two houses in betveen were rented to unsusrecting tenants.

¢. Mobile surveillance ves developed by Anderson and leter placed
under Mahoney and Joseph Sancho, This teem consisted of e half

dozen or so agents who used three to four late model cars end a

panel truck (which could be used on stakeouts for photo cover:
The plan was to activate this group by radio (from LIMITED 3ASE)
when someone of interest left the/abasey gate and stay with then
until they made their meetings. These agents knew ebout the LIMITED
BASE be@ause they had LIMITED photos for identification purposes.
This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)
when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his terget and

was arrested by the Mexican transit police end turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service. Py the time the Stetion could arrange through

nonitor who made short sunzaries of interesting conversations for a daily
resume which was received each day around 8 a.m. (passed by Flick to Goodpasture
to get to Scott before 9.a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)
full transcripts were typed and passed to the stetion in the same way, however,
there was usually a time leg of a day or eo, ‘Those transcripts which hdd
