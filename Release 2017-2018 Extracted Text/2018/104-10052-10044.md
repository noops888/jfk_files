Subject:

Background on Mexico Station Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1.

Unilateral coverage. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

April 1947) (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to

exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail Intercept operation.

a. Fhone taps were placed by an employee of the telephoce company

taraot de 8424491

who was handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines

tapped was i tried bly

by availability of a listering post nearby

(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally

these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

Three photo sites were handled by Arderson with the help

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY ISD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALIA) • LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across

the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance.

The Soviet gate was on the

Northl'est corner.of their compound and LIMITED vas diagonally.

that block. LIMITED was

the first base and it operaied strictly on an

ex erinentel basis

in the early stages.

I think the lexi Station bought

one storey

this property. (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the choto of "uniden man" was being released to the

puolic by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were noved to another apt

neerby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South.. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Embassy. The agents in LIMITED

and LILYRIC (both

Mexican fanilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound

which the Mexico Station purckased in about 1958 (check date), also using

LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (uno at thet tine vere largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

(Pamon Alvarez) (Mexican citizen of U.S. mother who taught elerentary level at

the American School). (Ramon collected the film patiends

en from LILTED

and LILYRIC three times a week. llis sister's husband, Carlos (leicar doctor)

developed and printed the film into 8x10 contact print strips.

The master plan

vas for LICALLA flIm to le processed inside TSD nan From 1957 to I959 (arper

- resigned) could not handle the volume and as the unprocessed film began

to accumulate, the inside CO (lahoney) becane disgusted and took the film out

for Ramon's orather-in-law to process

(probably early 1959). Thus Ramon became

the handler for all three photo

bases.

LEUST, 1, ste). This was hardled by Glen WIDDEN (outside ISD officer) ana

Mahoney using HQ IDY teams for monitoring. This operation vas also separate

from LICALLA. The two houses in between were rented to unsustecting tenants.

co Mobile surveillance was developed by Anderson and later placed

• under Mahoney and Joseph Sancho. This tean consisted of a half

dozen or so agents who used three to four late model cars and a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera e).

The plan was to activate this group by radio (fron LINTTED 3ASE)

when someone of interest left the imbassy gate and stay with them

until they made their meetings.. These agents knew about the LEITED

BASE bedause they had LINITED photos for identification purçoser..

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)

when one of the surveillance agents

got too close to his target and

was arrested by the Mexican transit police and turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service. By the time the Station could arrange through

a cleared attorney to bail him out Judd Austin of the Goodrich,

Little and Riquelme firm), the agent had identified Sancho (who was

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside

phone number of Mahoney (who was subsequently replaced by Louls

Fuckett): As a result of this flap, the LIFFAT project was broken

up into several others. The agents were not changed but were given

2. LIaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by the nature

of the Textcan services at that tine. The Mexican DES (Dicection of Federal

Security) with which ve dealt was a hip pocket group fun out of the linistry

Of Govirnment. This iinistry spent a major part of its time on control of

foreigners and political Investigations. Their agents were vicious, venal,

corrupt extortlonists. (Robert Melberg established contact with one of them

During 1958, Win Scott met socially some of the chronies of the

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopez Mateos, During

this period, the U.S.

Ambassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to "fight cormunism". One of these seeds

grew into a proposal (Viguel Alenan (ir. son of forner lexi President), acting

He designated Ann Goodpasture to meet dalling with Flick for routine supervision

of the listening post, picking up transcripts and tapes. Goodpasture had no

dealingswith the Mexicans except when Scott was ill or out of town. Generally,

all decisions were made by Scott. This was about late 1961.

3. "y memory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Embassy but I

think the staff first developed fron a pro-Castro group celebrating on New

Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a rakeshift arrangerent of volunteers

through most of 1960 and 61 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on

their actirities and recruitirg agents right and left arong Cuban nationals in

Mexico City.

4 Personnel assignments. Of interest to us now is who was in lexico during

the period prior to Osweld's visit and the subsequent investigation by the

Warren Conmission. To deternine who vas there and what they were doing i

have gro:ped persons together chronologically with areas of their assignment

as the

covrring from 1950 to 1969 so that ilxetles nanes pop up, one can tell what

period they were in Mexico and

their essignments, at the time.

About nid 1962 (check date) Livoy outside lext rept asked

for the telephone numers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Erbassies.

With this forevarning, LIPSAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and I Iugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live

nonitor who made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.I. (passed by Flick to Goodpasture

to get to Scott before 9 a.I., Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed ard passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so.: Those transcripts which had

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was

typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

Pussian conversations among the embers of the Soviet Erbassy.

During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. (Herbert lanell and his wife Berbera)

handled all of the processi:g of

Soviet transcripts. ly job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling himself Oswald

was

probably an American.

However, here again there was a backlag because

the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days prefiously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later ve got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operators, cleared the camera each day wether there was anyulilaxage a full

roll of filn exposed.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was

caused by waiting to
