Director of Security

Bernard L. BARKER - #201333

1. Reference is made to your memorandum of
5 August 1964, concerning loss of U. S. Citizenship
of the subject.

2. It is the opinion of this Staff that at this late

date subject has no recourse to overturn the Depart-

ment of State's ruling that he lost his U.S. Citizen-

ship by his accepting employment in the Cuban Govern-

ment. To protect the U. S. Citizenship of an individual

who engages in activities which would normally expatriate

himself requires prior agreement between this Agency and the
H Department of State. This was not done in subject's case. a
i Then, too, subject, by his application for and acceptance of > +.â€™
| an immigration visa to enter the U. S. as a permanent resi-

dent alien, is in effect, an admission by him of loss of his:

previous U. S. Citizenship.

3. As a permanent resident alien he must await. the
expiration of five years residence before he can petition
for naturalization unless a private bill were introduced to. -
waive the residence requirement.

4. It is believed that a review of subject's file atthe
Department of State would not reveal any information
which would change subject's status.
