(2) Involvement in Garrison's Investigation:

Ramparts of January 1968, p. 47, states that a former

Minuteman named Jerry Milton BROOKS had said that

BANISTER was the "head of the Anti-Communism League

of the Garlbbean." Ramparts anserta that this "league"

was "assertedly an intermediary between the CIA and

Caribbean Insurgency movemente."

(3) CIA relationship: None. According to our

records, Maurice Brooks GATLIN SI. (see below) was

legal counsel not, ar Bamparts says, to the "Anti-

Communinn League of the Caribbean" but to the "Anti-

Communism Committee of the Americas". FBI reporting

clearly indicates that GATLIN was the sole member of

this national group. An FBI report of 14 February 1961

quoted BANISTER as saying that he had never been an

officer or member of the "group", GATLIN's clairas to

the contrary notwithstanding.

large sume in the late 1950'a. Morales seems to have

considered him an agent representing the intereste of

Trujilo, although CATIN was not no regatered with

the Department of Justice, GATLIN used the aliased

Edward FAIRCHILD, James COCHRANE, Robert WATSON,

and Charle: EVERETT. A typical epimode occurred fa

November-December 1957, when GATLIN went to Eugene,

Oregon, because he had a theory that Jence De Galinder

(commonly belleved to have been kidnapped in New York

by Trujillo henchmen) was hiding out among Banque

sheep-herders there. On 2 December 1957 GATLIN

presented himself to an F'El special agent in Eugene and
