in respect. to guerrilia training for anti-Castro Gubans
has already, however, been drawn to Garrison's attention.

(3) DDP and Dcs relationships:

4 December 1967.) On 27 May 1965 SOD/AB/OPS/3
requested a POA to permit the use of BARTES as a
pilot in the Congo. The POA was granted on

20 July 1965, and an OA on 9 September 1965.

Testing of Subject's skill asa pilet revealed, hqwever,
that he was not qualified for the intended assignment,
He was returned to the U.S. on 11 February 1966
without baving been used operationally.

(b) DCS. The first contact of DCS New
Orleans with BARTES occurred on 4 May 1961,
Between that date and 9 January 1967 a total of
13 meetings took place. BARTES is the source of
six DCS reports. Contact has not been terminated,

b. George BROWN.

(2) Involvement in Garrison‘e investigation:
On 11 May 1967 LABORDE telephoned the DCS office
in New Orleans, said that he was an ex-CIA employee,
added that he feared Garrison would subpoena him,
and requested assistance or advice. Michael W.
LABORDE, the son of Lawrence, has told members of
Garrison's staff that his father was associated with
Alberto FERNANDEZ (see preceding sub-paragraph), a
with Gerald Patrick HEMMING, and one “Roy / perhaps
Leroy COLLINS / in training Cubans as guerrilla
fighters. Michael LABORDE has also implicated CIA
in this training. On 27 September 1967 Lawrence J.
LABORDE again called the DCS office in New Orleans.
In accordance with Headquarters‘ instructions he was
told that there was nothing to discuss. 2

(3) DDP relationship: LABORDE was a DDP

q@ Prior references: None.

(2) Involvement in Garrison's investigation: A
memorandum from DCS New Orleans, 15 November 1967,
reported that Hunter C. Leake of that office and Alfred
J. MORAN are very good friends, that Leake attended a
party at MORAN's home on 14 November 1967, and that at
that time MORAN told Leake that he (MORAN) had been
in touch with a member of Garrison's staff, Assistant D.A.
James ALCOCK, who questioned MORAN about an
occasion when Clem BERTRAND and MORAN were in the
VIP room of Eastern Airlines at the New Orleans
International Airport. MORAN told Leake that in his
opinion Garrison has an “ironclad” case against Clay SHAW.
A DCS New Orleans report of 13 December 1967 adde that
MORAN told Leake on 11 December 1967 that ALCOCK
and a#hother representative of Garrison's office had shown
him, sometime in 1967, what was alleged to be a photocopy
of the daily log from the VIP room at the airport. MORAN



recogmized bis own signature and that of Arthur Q.
DAVIS (a prominent New Orleans architect}. He said
that the name Clem BERTRAND was pointed out to him
_ on the ‘list and that Clay SHAW's name was not on the
“lst. ALCOCK and his colleague sald that e handwriting
expert had confirmed that the signature "Clem BERTRAND"
had been written by SHAW. It is noted that the DCS
report of 15 November 1967 quotes MORAN as saying that
SHAW was in the VIP room on the occasion about which
ALCOCK questioned MORAN, whereas the 13 December
1967 report quotes MORAN as eaying that he did not see
SHAW in the room at that time.

(3) DDP and DCS relationships:

Item reporter he admitted he was CIA. “ William W.
Turner, the writer of the cited Ram) article and

of other attacks by Ramparts on the FBI, stated

his staff for nine months. The San Francisco Chronicle
of 27 December 1967 quoted Garrison as saying,
"Every word in Ramparte is accurately stated.“

(3) DCS relationship: DALZELL had three

Michael W. LABORDE told members of Garrison's staff
that his father Lawrence had worked for CIA with anti-
Castro Cubans. He named "Jerry Patrick", who is
HEMMING, and one "Roy", probably Leroy COLLINS,
as associated with Lawrence LABORDE. He added that
Jerry Patrick and Roy ‘duped Cubans out of money" and
were dismissed by CIA. On 8 July 1967 HEMMING and
an associate, possibly COLLINS, went to Garrison's
office. They said that they were working for an unidentified
magazine and wanted to do a story on the Garrison
investigation. HEMMING has been reported by the FBI
and in the press as a soldier of fortune who has given
para-military training to anti-Castro Cuban refugees.
A teletype of 8 September 1967 from the DCS office in
Los Angeles states that HEMMING had claimed that a
45 automatic confiscated by a sheriff's office in Los Angeles

SCHLUMBERGER office in New Orleans, and the New
Orleans DCS cffice. Moreover, DCS has current
contacts with the main SCHLUMBERGER office in

h. John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr.

{1) Prior reference: Memorandum, subject:
Ramparts: John Garrett UNDERHILL Jr., Samuel George
CUMMINGS, and INTERARMCO, 19 July 1967.

(2) Involvement in Garrison's investigation:
Ramparts of June 1967 claimed that UNDERHILL, now
ad, was “on intimate terms with a number of high-

ranking CIA officials -- he was one of the Agency's

“ha


‘un-people* whe perform special assignments."
Ramparts of January 1968 adds, “Immediately after

the assassination, a distraught Underhill told friends
that a semi-autonomous CIA clique which had been
profiteering in narcotics and gun-running was implicated
in the aesassination." The close Garrison-Turnar
association and Garrison's vouching for the accuracy

of the Bupearte account suggest that Garrisen may
make si: ¥ assertions when his case comes to trial.

(3) DCS relationship: UNDERHILL was an
infrequent contact of the DCS New York offfce from
late 1949 to the mid-1950's. He was not employed by
that office. The purpose of contact was to obtain positive
foreign intelligence. :

5. Group Hf {total of 14)
a. Valentine ASHWORTH (201-337656).
{1} Prior references: None.

42) Involvement in Garrison's investigation:
On 9 October 1962 ASHWORTH sent a letter from
Leesville, Lovisiana, to the Cuban Ambassador in
Mexico. He offered information about the “Cuban Raider
Gormmand" and the “People's Revolutionary Movernent" i
im exchange for help in defecting to Cuba. He said that
GIA did not have the same information. Arrested on
16 May 1966 for investigation of auto theft, ASHWORTH
teld an FRI special agent that he had participated in
several raids on Cuba, that he was a pilot and an expert
in explosives, and that CLA was aware of his activities
and could provide information about them. Arrested
again on 26 April 1967 for possession of a stolen
automobile, ASHWORTH was sent to the jail in Lake
Charles, Louisiana. A fellow inmate, one Richard
PHILLIPS, wrote the FBI to say that ASHWORTH claimed
to have shared an apartment in Chic with Lee Harvey
Oswald, that Oswald and he belonged to a group of
New Orleans Cubans who killed President Kennedy and
“were supposed to kill Castro at the same time", that

_—



“Oswald was a patsey (sic) and didn't fire a shot;

that "Kennedy‘s assins (sic) were, as was Oswald,
trained by the CIA", etc. On 13 October 1967 2 deputy
sheriff advised the FBI that an unidentified assistant
district attorney on Garrigon's staff had come to Lake
Charles one month earlier and had interviewed
ASHWORTH for an hour. According te PHILLIPS,
Garrison's representatives have questioned ASHWORTH
about four times and have asked him if he was a member
of CIA. The U.S. Marine Corps advised on 3 January
1968 that ASHWORTH enlisted on 24 December 1952,
was honorably discharged on 18 March 1953, reenlisted
the next day, and then served until 3 December 1954,
when given a bad conduct discharge following a general
court-martial at which he was found quilty of unlawful
absence and failure to obey lawful orders. -

(3) CIA relationship: None.
b. W. Guy BANISTER

(i) Prior references: Memorandum No. I,
26 April 1967, Enclosure 3; Memorandum No. 2,
8 May 1967, Enclosure 3.

(2) Involvement in Garrison's investigation:
Ramparts of January 1968, p. 47, states that a former
Minuteman named Jerry Milton BROOKS kad said that
BANISTER wae the “head of the Anti-Communism League
of the Caribbean." Ramparts asserts that thie “league”
was "assertedly an intermediary between the CIA and
Caribbean insurgency movements."

(3} CIA relationship: None. According to our
records, Maurice Brooks GATLIN Sr. (see below) was
legal counsel not, as Ramparts says, to the “Anti-
Communism League of the Caribbean" but to the "Anti-
Communism Committee of the Americas". FBI reporting
clearly indicates that GATLIN was the sole member of
this national group. An FBI report of 14 February 1961
quoted BANISTER as saying that he had never been an
officer or member of the "group", GATLIN's claims to
the contrary notwithstanding.

16



c. Maurice Brooks GATLIN Sr. (201-53454}.
(1) Prior references: None.

(2) Invotvement in Garrison's investigation:
Ramparts of January 1968 quotes one Jerty Milton
BROOKS (see preceding sub-paragraph) as claiming
to have been a “sort of protege" of GATLIN. BROOKS
claimed that about 1962 GATLIN, “in a acli-important
manner", remarked that he had $100,000 of CIA money
earmarked fer a French rightewing clique that was
going to attempt to assasainate General De Gaulle.
GATLIN died in Panama in 1964, at the age of sixty-one.
FBI reports on him cite sources who knew him well e
88 saying that he was insane and should have been committed.
He duped Eduardo A. Morales, Consul General of the
Dominican Republic in New Orleans, cut of relatively
large eaums in the late 1950's. Morales seems te have
considered him an agent representing the interests of
Trujillo, although GATLIN wae not so registered with
the Department of Justice. GATLIN used the aliases
Edward FAIRCHILD, James COGHRANE, Rebert WATSON,
and Charles EVERETT. A typical episode occurred in
November-December 1957, whea GATLIN went to Eugene,
Oregon, because he had a theory that Josue De Galindes
(commonly believed to have been kidnapped in New York
by Trujillo henchmen) was hiding out among Basque
sheep-herders there. On 2 December 1957 GATLIN
presented himself to an FBI special agent in Eugene and
said that “if he was found dead in Eugene it was murder,
not suicide".

(3) CIA relationship: None. An OO report of
19 December 1953 states that on 13 October 1953 GATLIN
called on an OO office, eaid that rlote were scheduled to
occur in Guatemala, and added that he thought some CIA
representatives there might be in danger. “He suggested
that he be furnished the names.of agents who were posing
as members of the Gommunist organization so that he
could prevent their being assassinated in error."
He also suggested that CIA give him $75, 000 to fund the
assassination of 15 top Communist leadera in Latin America.
