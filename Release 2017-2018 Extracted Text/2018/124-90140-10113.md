DI. LUNSFORD owns 50% of this island, and his two

partners, J. ABNEY COX, a well-to-do Homestead businessman,

and DI. NELSON PEARSON of Miami, own 25% each. DI. LUNSFORD

stated that he felt that his partners would be willing to go

along with them.

SAS HAYES and DAVIS explained to DI. LUNSFORD that

the FBI had no interest in this matter, the FBI was not in a

position to give him any advice whatsoever, but that information

reported by him to this office would be furnished appropriate

U. S. Government agencies.

No indication was made whatsoever

that any branch of the government might be interested in this

island.

Pertinent portions of this interview with Dr. LUNSFORD

were immediately conveyed to Mr.

I CIA, MIamI, who S)

expressed an interest in the island, and stated that he was

under consideration use of this island in connection with his

operations.

With regard to the shooting incident which occurred

on the VASQUEZ property near Princeton, Fla. on 8/26/60, Mr.

AL TARABOCHIA, Deputy, Dade County Department of Public Safety,

advised this matter was still under investigation by his office,

and that facts developed to date reflected that the five boys

responsible for creating the incident were local juvenile

characters from Homestead, Fla., who threw fire crackers at the

house, and who admitted having

fire arms in the back of their

car.

Mr. TARABOCHIA said that investigation indicated that this

was a "harassment" incident perpetrated by these boys, and that

Miami newspapers had exaggerated the incident.

SECREU

On 8/27/60, Mrs. VASQUEZ advised that she was becom-

ing desperate, because she and her husband had about a hundred

men who were anxious to participate in some action against

CASTRO; that she had

â€¢ planned to place these men at another camp

or on an island, and that she had been unable to receive any

satisfaction concerning the situation from Colonel MIGUEL PONS

of Washington, DC. She also stated she learned from Deputies

CLODE and LEONARD of the Dade County Department of Public

Safety, that the five American boys from Homestead who created

the incident, above, described, were to be charged with some

criminal violation by the sheriff's office, and that the Cubans

would merely be charged with vagrancy at most.

On 8/30/60, Mrs. VASQUEZ said that Deputies CLODE

and LEONARD told her that there was no reason why she should

not place an additional hundred men on this property, that the

sheriff's office intended to drop all charges against the Cubans.

Mrs. VASQUEZ states she now has 32 men at this camp. She

also stated that she was becoming more and more desperate about

the situation, and she desired, if possible, to make direct

contact with a representative of CIA concerning this matter. JE(U)

It is to be noted that at no time has the Miami Office

ever disclosed or indicated in any way to Mr. and Mrs. VASQUEZ

recent sabotage boat trip to Cuba.

Above request of Mrs. VASQUEZ was conveyed imnediately

of CIA, who stated that he would like to have Mr.

ROBERT HOPKINS, overt CIA representative in Miami, contact Mrs.

VASQUEZ and her husband, in order to remove the burden of this

matter from the FBI, although at that point, he was

uncertain

as to whether or not CIA would be able to use them.
