U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC requests contained in letter
of Senator Frank Church dated November 7, 1975, for materials
concerning Martin Luther King, Jr.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
to the SSC of information and materials in response to request:
contained in the above SSC letter.

Q

The attention of the SSC is invited to FBI memorandua
dated November 11, 1975, which referred to a highly sensitive
oral briefing furnished te Senator Church and selected members
of the SSC Staff by FBI personnel on November 5, 1975. This
briefing was intended, in part, to serve in lieu of any
written information in response to SSC requests for comuni~-
cations documenting Stanley David Levison as a secret member
of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA).

Because of SSC. insistence in requesting items to
establish factual basis for Levison's secret CPUSA membership,
as set forth in referenced SSC letter, our New York office
was contacted for documents representing original recordings
from Bureau informants concerning Levison. As a result our
Hew York office provided the material which is now being
delivered and which has served as a basis for statements in
eeeegsee documents that Levison was a secret member of

SENATE SELECT COMMITTER ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

It is noted that referenced SSC letter requested un-
excised copies of the February 22, and June 12, 1962, communi-
cations from New York which appear to have been the “articulated
predicates for the ‘cominfil* case." The SSC letter did not
identify captions of these communications; nor identify any
specific “cominfil case." Therefore, we were unable to locate
any pertinent documents bearing these dates in our Headquarters:
files. At a meeting on November 12, 1975, between SSC Staff
Member Michael Epstein and representatives of the Intelligence
Division of the FBI, it was agreed that the two documents
apparently referred to above are New York airtel dated February 12,
1962, captioned "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; SM-C" and New York
letter dated August 21, 1962, captioned “Commmist Infiltration
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; iS-C."

New York airtel dated February 12, 1962, is being
delivered with this memorandum among those documents received
from our New York office. Excisions in this document are
fewer than those made in a capy previously provided the SSC. A
copy bearing no or fewer excisions cannot be provided the SSC
for reasons made clear during the oral briefing of Senator
Church and selected SSC Staff membars on November 5, 1975.

It is noted that New York letter dated August 21, 1962,
which is being delivered with this memorandum, is not believed
to have been previously provided the SSC.

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

I want you to know how much I appreciated the ’.
opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other
day about the Martin Luther King, Jr. case. It was most
helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-~
cerning the background of the case, and I can assure you
that we will do everything possible to avoid jogpardizing ~~~
any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific
items set forth in earlier document requests which would
presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion
as of various dates in 1962, 1963 and'1964 that Stanley 7
Levison was a “secret member of the Communist Party, USA."

Of course in the event that there is no particular document

in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to

the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us know
so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that
context. Finell £ course, we still need umezcised copies -
‘of the Febrita y Z munications from

Rew York which appear the articulated predicates
for the "cominfil” case.

Eg LIVE Sadbey 0 ENTELUGENCE of EE 0
Yon 4/9/64, firy “654-3 made the following observations
with regard to tha) CP svatus of STANLEY LEVISON:

LEVISON has been an important Party member for
many years (@na never at any time differed with the Party with
respect to the Party line. His only difference with the
Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion
the Party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending
Negro rights, In this respect, he has been to the "left"
of the Party, LEVISON's differences with the Party are merely
“tactical.” He has never criticized the Party, except with
respect to the Party's handling of the Negro question. ‘The
fact that he does not accept domination by the Party with
regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be
construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all
respects. The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly
relations with LEVISON as it was in the past.

(xe should be noted that LEVISON never has been
officially "drummed out" of the Party, nor has anyone ever

.eviticized him for being opposed to the Party's general

principles. It further should be noted that according to
the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of

LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that
he does not continue to be a CP member, It.should be noted
shat it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING
movement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly
wepudiate>the Party, which he has never done. It should be
Surther noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact
LEVISON. LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that
BEN DAVIS was the only CP functionary who had a sufficiently
"militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of
the Negro movement. ‘The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet
have not met should not be construed to mean that LEVISON
has refuséd to confer with DAVIS, As NY 694-S* understands
the situation, DAVIS has been awaiting contact by LEVISON,
and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS.
Each of these individuals is sufficiently egotistical to
expect that the other would make the first move in an effort
to establish contact, NY 694-S* believes that probably the
reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements
for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and that
HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting
0 between LEVISON and DAVIS.

NY 694-S* has never obtained any information re-
flecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to
Marxism, Even though his present estrangement from the Party
might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member,
there is no reason to come to the conclusion that LEVISON is
no longer an ideological Communist.

JACK talked to LEM HARRIS yesterday who said he
contacted STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial
-hello which was a change from the past when he was cool.

LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him
and would like to see him immediately to which LEVENSON said,
"T would like very much to see you but I don't have the time
now. I'm leaving and packing for a trip. I will be glad to
see you in six weeks."

LEVENSON impliec. that he was going to Ecuador but
LEM doesn't know why. @ was no anger shown, and LEVENSON
will see LEM when he retuyns in six weeks.

(on 6/13/63, NY 694.S* furnished the following
informati6n to SA ALEXANDER C, BURLINSON:

On 6/12/63, TEMENT HaRRIS,CPUSA Reserve Fund
funectionary, told NY 694-S* that in a recent meeting with
STANLEY LEVISON, the latter furnished him the following
_ information:

The LEVISONS, particularly STANLEY, are still
MARTIN LUTHER KING's "brain trust"--now more than ever before.
This is so despite the fact that at a meeting of STANLEY
LEVISON, ROY LEVISON, HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, MARTIN LUTHER
KING and "the Attorney General's chief assistant", the
Attorney General's assistant, pointing to the IEVISONS
and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, stated to MARTIN LUTHER KING,
"These men are Party members; watch out for them,"

MARTIN LUTHER KING did not "bat an eyelash" upon
hearing the Assistant Attorney General's remark, and after
the latter left the meeting, those in the group smiled at each
other. STANLEY LEVISON said to KING, at this:time, "I
congratulate you on the way you acted regarding his warning.
You are a real Marxist-Leninist. This is how a true
Marxist~Leninist acts."

Everything that KING does he first discusses
witn STANLEY LEVISON and he accepts LEVISON's advice whole-
heartedly. KING also wholeheartedly accepts the advice of
HUNTER PITTS O'DELL as regards matters within the latter's
local jurisdiction,

M&RTIN LUTHER KING was asked by a group of newspaper
reporters whether he takes orders from "the Communists”
ard also, whether he took "orders from STANIEY LEVISON,. it
KING's response was that he took orders only from God.

By reason of the fact that the LEVISONS feel that
the Party has done little, if anything, to assist the fight



sFl?

SF:

NY 100-136585

for civil rights for Negroes, and further, since they feel
that the Party, as a result of this "do nothing" attitude,
has lost prestige, they will no longer permit the Party

to dominate or control thei~ activities in the MARTIN LUTHER
KING movement. They are severing themselves, financially
and in a disciplinary way, from the Party. ‘the LEVISONS \
and O'DELL\are still Party members,( but do'’not desire to be
openly "linked up" with the Party. “Although they are "dis-
enchanted’ with, the Party, they are not quitting the Party.
With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they will
act on their o initiative, and will not accept instructions
from the Party.

TEM HARRIS then advised that the Party, however,
still would like to control the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement.
BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be "liaison or intermediary"
with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. Whether or not
the LEVISONS and O?DELL will maintain liaison regarding
matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a
matter for them to decide. In view of LEVISON's statement ~~
with respect to advising MARTIN LUTHER KING independently
of Party instructions, it would seem that DAVIS may not have
any success in maintaining liaison with the LEVISONS and
HUNTER PITTS O'tDELL. The LEVISONS and O'DELL are aware of

jo the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignment

by the Party.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, according to LEM HARRIS, is
referred to by such top Party functionaries as GUS HALL,
BEN DAVIS, JIM JACKSON and “LAUDE LIGHTFOOT as a "true,
genuine, Marxist-Leninist from the top of his head to the tips
of his toes." In the Party, the report is that MARTIN LUTHER
KING is following a Marxist-Leninist line.

NY 694-S* advised that he asked LEM HARRIS whether
or not, to the latter's knowledge, MARTIN LUTHER KING was
a member of the CPUSA, LEM HARRIS replied that he did not
know. :

When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address
the AFL-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-
vice, first obtained approval to do so from A, PHILLIP RANDOLPH,
negro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the
matter, might have felt that KING's making a speech at the
aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.

KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the
APL-CIO convention, and, asa result, received invitations
from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel,"
to address their respective unions. As the outstanding
champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful
political influence, recognized as such by the higher echelons
‘of the Democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General
ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need
KING, particularly in the South, where in cities like Atlanta
and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of
power, and where KING controls the negro vote.

7 JAMES ROFFA, Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates
the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING
ean influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters
Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union,
and KING accepted the invitation. Knowing that KING is being
deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY,
HOFFA requested KING to contact the Attorney General in an
effort to influence the latter "to lay off" HOFFA, KING was
inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convinced him
that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and
likely to be a "boomerang," since the Attorney General would
oneal accede to such a request, particularly in the case of
OFFA, :

LEVISON had to steer KING away from another politi-
cally hazardous situation. Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER,
Hollywood movie director, entered into negotiations with a
KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture
which PREMINGER woulddirect, Although PREMINGER's offer was
"tempting," since it meant "fast, easy money" for KING's
organization, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the
offer bigest note the latters prestige, After convincing
KING o. his fact, LEVISON personally, telephoned to D GER.
telling him that ‘the deal was off." ) ae

What LEVISON particularly wanted GUS HALL to knew
is that “KING is a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied
it (Marxism), believes in it, and agrees with it, but because
of his being a minister of religion, does not dare to espouse
it publicly."

GUS HALL, according to HARRIS, was "elated" to
receive LEVISON's report on LUTHER KING.

PEELE LEVISON stated, according to Ne Bre. st) that
’ KING liked LEVISON's suggestion with respect to O'DELL

Committee to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle, 312 West 125th
Street, attention of STANLEY D. LEVISON.

NY has considered the above facts and is of the
opinion that a Cominfil investigation of the NY Chapter
of the SCLC is warranted, due to the dominant CP influence
on the executives of the NY Chapter of the SCLC,

NY will conduct no further “investigation without
prior Bureau authority.

Reference ia further made’to cur memoranda dated

: duly 17,°1975, and September 25, 1975, which provided background

information and documenta pertaining to the SI, ADEX, and RI.

. AS you ara aware, a computerized ADBY listing is pre~
pared ‘wonth aly at FRING. he SI List was prepared in the same
manner and, as with the’ former 81, when a new monthly ADEY List .
is prepared copies of the old List are destroyed inasmuch as they |
are outdated and ac longer serve a i ‘al purpose. As you. have
been previously advised, names appearing on the former ST and

the ADEX have been printed on 5 & 8 cards with a single name
printed on each card, Background information, file numbers, and
type of activity in which the individual is engaged are also
placed’on these cards. As you are.aware, approximately 15,000 of
these cards, all outdated, have been located ag FBIHQ. These

‘ eards include some whith contain the identity of individuals vho |

were maintained on the Priority ITI level of the former S$ and
all ADEA cards deleted or cancelled since its inception. .

Duiring the initial period of establishing the ADEX, in
order te obviate the need for conducting massive file reviews,
the ADEX consistad primarily of the identity of those individuals
who had been maintained on the former SI. Although these names
were originally placed in thigs-manner on the new ADEX, aa ca
were reviewed.under our then existing report. procedures, each
easa was to be reviewed on its-owm mex utilizing the then
current criteria for ADEX to determine whether continued in-

RE: UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTER TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

name was deleted. As previously indicated, during 1972 the aDrx
was evaluated and revised. Following this revision, the number
of individuals who were included on the ADEX began to decline
and thus the high numbor of cancelled cards. In accordance with
Bureau policy, which was instituted during the SI program, these
cancelled cards arte maintained at FPBINQ for a period of three
years and there is no way to raconstuct a former SI or ADEX list
for a particular time period by roviewing these cancelled cards.
These cards, however, will reflect the identity of those in~
dividuals whe have been placed on the SI and the ADEX for the
period for which these cards were maintained.

Per your request, these outdated SI and ADEX cards
are available for review by appropriate SSC representives
at FBIHQ. In this regard, SSC Staff Members Martha Talley and
John @. DILi££ have had access to these cards on October 30,
1975, and November 7, 1975, respectively.

During Mr. BlLiff's review of these cards, the names
Shelley Blum, Emanuel James Brisker, Jr,, and Gregory Allan
Calvert were salected by Mr. ELLI££ in connection with request
number two of your October 28, 1975, letter. Documents re-
quested rogarding these individuals are enclosed.

A review of pertinent files at FBIHQ regarding the SI
and the RI indicates thore are no other versions of the former
SI of RI at PBIHO. Contact was also made with knowledgeable
individuals of our New York City Field Office and it was deter-
mined these programs had boon handled in accordance with thon
existing FBIBQ policy and no other versionsof these programs
qiore compiled by that office,

Materials requested for delivery under item number
four of your Octobor 28, 1975, letter are enclosed. In this re-
gard, it is noted the correct FBINQ file number for tho Emma
Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs is 100~-400394 and
the correct file number for the file regarding Communist Infil-
tration of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People is 61-3176. In order to be responsive to your
request, pertinent documents of the typo desired are being fur-
nished regarding these organizations from these files.

Department of State advised that the primary objective of
the visitors was to discuss with the Ambassador and
members of his staff the relationships and exercise of
authority by the Ambassador of the intelligence activities
in the field. The Department of State further advised that
operational detaiis, sources and methods were not construed
to be logitimate avenues of inquiry by the SSC Staff
Members.

Legat, Brasilia, was interviewed on September 22,
1975, by Messrs, Aaron and Truchart, with Aaron being
dominant in the interviewing process. The interview was
directed mainly toward attempts to elicit examples whereby

appeared understanding and in agreement with the necessity
of each confidential source to serve FBI's and U, S.
Government's best interests in Brazil. The question
seemingly bearing the most weight during the interview
concerned possible unauthorized activities of CIA and its
lack of cooperation and coordination with FBI and the
Defense Attache's Office. The duration of the interviow
was approximately forty-five minutes As)

Legat, Buenos Aires, was interviewed by the two

the interview by stating that the operations of Legats,
Brasiiie, and Buenos Aires, were not the type of Legat
operations he desired to review, indicating that
Mexico City Logat's operations were more of the type of
interest to them. Aaron asked pointed questions
concerning the mechanics of Legat reporting on
intelligence information developed locally to FBIE} and
the local coordination of this information with the
Eubassy components. Aaron requested the Legat provide
him with the general nature of intelligence developed
and reported by the Legat to the Embassy and FRTHQ. He
was told that gencrally international and local terrorisn
were the prime topics of Legat reporting. Inquiry was
2iso made into the reason for FBI exnansion of forcign
liaison activities in 1970. He was told that tho Legat
was not personally aware of any special reason other than
that the FLI liaison operations required additional
personnel adi Aaron was referred to FE for any
additional information in this regard. /Zegat was asked
whether tho[ sd had ever vequested Legat to secure
from FLL computer banks on Argentine residents of
interest who had previously resided in the U. S.
Legat's reply was in the negative. Other questions mainly
dealt with cooporation and coordination activities betwoen
the FLI and the Inquiry was also mado (¢
into the relationship o: e Drug’ saforcement Agency and »
BGI overseas. ‘The interview lasted approximately thirty-
five minutes.

Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, Mr. Aaron was
suffering from an intestinal problem and remained in bis

Memorandum advises concerning proposed SSC

hearing on FBI foreign counterintelligence (CI) matters?

On 10/30/75 Mr. John Elliff, SSC Staff Member,
met with Assistant Director W, R, Wannall, Intelligence
Division (INTD). Also present were Section Chiefs W. A.
Branigan (CI-1) and W. O, Cregar (CI-2) and Acting Section
Chief F. J. Cassidy (IS-3) and Unit Chief E, W, Larson,
Training Unit (IS-3). Mr. Elliff advised that the Committee
proposed to have an executive session tentatively scheduled
for the morning of Friday, 11/14/75, whichdwowidndeal with
foreign CI operations. In addition to representatives from
the FBI they envisioned also having present representatives
from CIA and the United States military intelligence services,
He stated that the session would be scheduled for approximately
2 and one-half hours,

During the conference the following three themes
were outlined by Mr. Elliff as the probable areas of
discussion:

1, Changes in Ci operations during recent years

Items discussed as probably worthy of attention
were phySical surveillances, the walk-in operations,
defection (recruitment-in-place), CI training programs,
Also suggested as a prime topic was the future projections
concerning administration of foreign CI operations in the mio
United States, i,e., new division for CI work within FBI;
separate CI service; or other nie rly ye

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: U. 8S. Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence Activities (SSC)

2. Counter-subversion

In this category Mr. Elliff indicated a particular
interest in foreign influence in domestic groups and the
assessment of danger/risk in investigations undertaken to
detect such influence, He brought up the disclosures of
surveillances by CIA of Americans abroad at the request of
the FBI, He also indicated an interest in borderline cases,
such as those in which domestic counter-subversion
investigations develop a CI aspect, and was particularly
interested in the policies and coordinating mechanisms
affecting such instances,

3. Positive intelligence collection

In this category Mr, E1liff was interested in
the responsibility for collection of positive intelligence
within the United States and the apparent gap which existed
in this field, He was also interested in situations under
which the FBI might target friendly foreign intelligence
services in the United States for CI attention,

Considerable discussion was held during the
conference during which INTD representatives set forth the
FBI's position and experience in the many areas noted,
They are being set forth here to illustrate the probable
scope and nature of the executive session which is being
planned, Further discussions will be held with the SSC
staff to clarify these matters and a firmer agenda for the
proposed 11/14/75 hearing will be developed,

With respect to the proposed plan. to include
representatives of CIA and the military intelligence services
along with the FBI in the proposed session of 2 and one
half hours, it was pointed out to Mr, Elliff that this would
not appear to be a very productive procedure, The CI
perspectives and responsibilities of CIA and the military
services are much more narrow and generally in a completely
different context than the CI perspectives and responsibilities
of the FBI, These differences, particularly in the short

time allotted, appear to represent a disadvantage to all
parties concerned, including the Committee, It was pointed
out that the FBI, in particular, would have considerable
difficulty in presenting a comprehensive and valid picture
of its own CI operations under the conditions imposed by
such a Session, Mr, E1liff, after considering these
objections, stated that he could understand the FBI
position but was Somewhat doubtful considering the pressures
under which the Committee was operating that he would be
able to alter this situation,

SUBJECT: Director Sec’y,

Among the documents from Federal Bureau of Investigation
files provided to my office under a cover memorandum dated
October 7, 1975, there was a memorandum dated July 18, 1973
and titled "Joseph Kraft," This document, along with the others,
— was provided to Mr, Kraft's attorneys pursuant to the agreement
of August 5, 1975, for review before the department furnished

\
it to the Senate Select Committee. Yo xy}
NS

When Mr. Kraft and his attorneys reviewed the July 18, 1973,
document they raised a question about a reference on page two of ~ \
the document which stated: re)

"On September 4, 1969, Joseph Kraft
hd advised the Washington Field Office of the
FBI that he left his home (3021 N Stre
\e N. W., Washington D. C.) at approximatt ,
9:20 P.M. on September 3, 1969, to visit
with former Governor Averell Harriman who; o-Wb3I5~ 1159,

"On the morning of September 4, 1969,
the Metropolitan Police Department was advised
by the Washington National Airport Police that
some silverware had been found near one of the
entrances to the terminal at the Washington
National Airport. The silverware was recovered
by the Metropolitan Police Department and
processed for latent fingerprints without
success and the items were returned to Mrs,
Kraft upon her identification of the silverware.
No suspects were developed by either the FBI
or the Metropolitan Police Department in the
investigation of the matter."

Mr. Kraft does not recall having spoken to the FBI about the
burglary. Documents provided more recently to Mr. Kraft pursuant

to the August
question.

5, 1975, agreement do not shed any light on this

The incident is curious in that the only reference to it comes
in the memorandum of July 18, 1973, discussing a press report about
the activities of John D. Erlichman. Could you have someone look
into this matter for me? The obvious questions are: What other
documents in FBI files say about the September 3, 1969, burglary?

What files of
about how the

| NW 55086 DocId:32989550

the Bureau or its Washington field office indicate
conversation about the burglary took place?

SUBJECT: © DENCON

As the Bureau is aware, I am gravely concerned ovey
the potential for serious violence occurring in Chicago during
the period of the Democratic Convention, which commences
August 26, 1968 and the days immediately preceding this
convention, Had the convention occurred within 30 days after
the President made his announcement that he was not going to
run for reelection and after the Viet Nam peace talks started
in Paris, I feel that we might not haye had serious violence
as these two occurrences took much of the steam out of many of
the organizations comprising the "N

New Left", Their direction
at that tine was primerily against President JOHNSON and
‘against Viet Nam and much of the steam went out of their
‘programs following these two announcements.

It is our observation, however, that these "New Left"
organizations have now had time to redirect their programs
and are now concentrating primarily on demonstrations and
activities against Vice President HUMPHREY, characterized
by them as the "Dump Humphrey Campaign". The fact that the

<> lwar still continues in Viet Nam, has again given emphasis

to the organizations which exist on the basic theme of anti-
, Viet Nam, I am thinking particularly of such organizations
¥ fas the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet
‘Nam, Students for Democratic Society, Student Mobilization
!Committee to End the War in Viet Nam and the Youth International
Party (Yippies).

For the Bureau's information, Sgt. JOSEPH GRUBISIC,
Intelligence Section, Chicago PD, advised previously that he
had learned from DAVID STAHL of the Mayor's Office, Chicago, :
that they had received a telephone call, a couple of days ago, 4
from one WES POMEROY of the U.S. Attorney General's Office, 1
to the effect that the Attorney General wanted the Chicago
city officials to give every consideration to the granting
of the permits requested by the Yippies.

7 Sgt. GRUBISIC was unable to comment on the feeling
of the city administration to this request but was of the
opinion that such permits would not be granted as requested.
Sgt. GRUBISIC based his opinion on the fact that four repre-
sentatives of the Yippies, from New York City, had gone to
the office of the Deputy Superintendent of the Chicago PD and
had requested immunity from arrest for all Yippies during the
convention for crimes around the possession of narcotics. The
Yippies stated that any arrest would cause the Yippie community
to cause large scale riots, and the blame of any riots resulting
from such arrests would fall on the Chicago PD.

These representatives of the Yippies were advised
in no uncertain terms that the laws of the City of Chicago
would be strictly enforced fairly on ail persons and that no

, one would be granted any immunity during this period.

The Bureau's attmtion is invited to the August 9,
1968, issue of the "Daily World," daily publication of the
Communist Party, USA (CP), wherein an article appeared on page
one captioned "Rallies Will Ring Demo Convention" written by
CARYL /DAVIAU, current memberl, CP of Illinois, in which the
vo By indicates that the jNational Mobilization Committee 7 j

to End the War in Vietnam,which is working around the clock to
mobi/lize demonstrations against the convention,has petitioned
the Justice Department to investigate the Chicago Police to
determine if there is any conspiracy to deprive "us" of our
full civil liberties. .

Chicago will continue to.follow these matters
closely and immediately advise the Bureau, and continue to
disseminate all information of intelligence collected to
interested agencies.

No recommendation is being made nor is Chicago
involving itself in any plans affecting the issuance of the
abovementioned park permit.

As the Bureau is aware, Chicago is in receipt of

/ information from confidential scarces indicating a potential
for demonstration arising out of the "New Left" calling for
direct confrontation with the Chicago Police Department as a
diversionary tactic for a "crash-in" at the convention site.
Sources have also reported independent action on the part of
individuals to cause some form of "sabotage" activity inside
the convention itself, Information received from confidential
informants in other divisions indicates attempts on the part

: demonstrators to Chicago and a caravan of militant Latin

:&mericans to come from the Miami, Florida area to Chicago for
the specific purpose of disrupting the Democratic National
Convention,

The Chicago area activists in the Youth International

{the p are currently planning a "Festival of Lights" in one of

the parks on Chicago's lakefront during the period of the
Democratic National Convention. This “Festival of Lights"
characterized by Chicago area Yippie leadership as being peaceful
to show America thut there is an alternative to the "festival
of death", or the Democratic National Convention. However,
sources report that there are elements within the Youth Inter-
national Party which are calling for direct confrontation with
the Chicago Police Department during the "FeStival of Lights".
There is a very definite indication that more and
more plans are being made by these groups to cause violence and
trouble and undoubtedly this will increase even more as we
approach the time of the convention, I strongly feel that we

‘the Director, the President of the United States and other, pertinent
officials are furnished every possible piece of. intelligence
information which we can gather from any source.

I am specifically asking for the services of two
Special Agents who proved during their assignment, in Chicago that
they are expecially well qualified to handle informants and make
contacts in the "New Left" area, .They proved during their
assignments in Chicago that they have the knowhow, the interest,

request authority where necessary to utilize them in under~

would be specifically assigned fulltime to solicit information
from the leacership of the "New Left" concerning their plans
for demonstrations, confrontations and disruptions of the
Democratic Convention and matters relating thereto,

ae iam, therefore, urgently requesting that |SA WILLIAM]

be assigned on a temporary baSis”in Chicago for the above stated
purpose from August 15, 1968 through August 31, 1968, Both

men, while young in years in the Bureau, demonstrated outstanding
judgment and I am convinced that their assignments, as recommended
above, would prove to be most beneficial in carrying out our
responsibilities in connection with the Demoeratic Convention.

Office that he must remove himself as a squad

leader of an “action squad."

On 5/4/64, the Bureau advised SAC, Birmingham,

that “in those cases whore you have an informant

insure that the informant understands he is not
to direct, lead, or instigate any acts of violence."
It was also pointed out that informant should be
instructed to avoid participation in any act of
violence.

to Rowe for his testimony in the up-coming trials, Birmingham
previously requested to submit a detailed accounting of Rowe's
debts showing their basis, when contracted and schedule of
payments. The information received from the field needs to be
further clarified after which time this matter will be discussed
with the Department and its views obtained as to whether or not
payment of these debts would be judicious at this time,

invaluable service to the Bureau in connection with the case:

Meriorandum to Mr. Belmont
’ RE:, EUGENE THOMAS, ET AL

OBSERVATIONS OF GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

: The Bureau is currently paying Gary Thomas Rowe ri
$16.00 per day subsistencein licu of expenses. This figure 7
was initially decided upon after discussion with the Departi..ent,
and with the Department's approval, as it was recognized that
the informant had to be removed from the Birmingham area for
his protection and safety. The Department pointed out that
it would not be desirable to make any lump sum or large

- payment to the informant so long as he might be called upon
to testify, as any such large payments might be construed
in court as a payment for his testimony, whereas payment
of his living expenses can readily be justified as a necessity.
*
ang

In tne trial of subject Collie Leroy

iciidiniamiaiaerdet ntsnecrcatecate

ins which
began 53-65 and resulted in a hung jury, the Bu was called
upon to produce a record of payments to the informant. In a
future trial, it is reasonable to expect that we will again be
called upon to produce such a record. The payment of Rowe's
debts at this time amounting to over two thousand dollars
;Would appear in this record of payments to Rowe, and we
certainly could not agree ta pay such a large amount at this
time without the Department's approval.

nnn

With regard to the debts themselves, it would not
appear from information furnished by Birmingham that they are
all due and payable immediately, as the larger debts to the
two banks would probably be payable in monthly installments.
We could, with Department's approval, agree to payment of
his smaller debts and monthly installments on these larger

- {debts as they come due.

SSHRC Net
na PBR RENE ee

RECOMMENDATION

q In view of the above, it is recommended that
Birmingham be instructed to submit a detailed accounting of

Rowe's debts showing their basis, when they were contracted, q
_@ue dates and a full breakdown of any installment contracts 4
showing detailed schedule of payments. Upon receipt of this 1
information, the matter will be discussed with the Department i
and their views as to whether or not payment of these debts ;
at this time would be judicious, will be obtained. Airtel

Federal civil rights trial of the Liuzzo shooting in Montgomery,
Alabama, beginning 11/29/65, had exhibited feelings of reluctance
-to testify for the Government and set forth bach conditions
under which he would agree to testify.

These conditions consist of an agreement from the
“Attorney General that his _ testimony would not be required in any
future proceedings, that he be assisted-in ob tatming employwent
and that some assurances be given him for the future security of
his ex-wife and children and parents. He aiso expressed a desire
to visit his wife and children in the Tampa, Florida, area over
the Thanksgiving holday.

Rowe's conditions were discussed in detail’ with ©. /

would discuss these conditions immediately with the Attorney
General and requested that we arrange for Rowe to visit with his
. family in Tampa over Thanksgiving, 11/25/65, and that he would
then personally meet with Rowe in Tampa on Saturday morning,
11/27/65. He said that he is planning to try the case personally
n Montgomery and that Rowe's testimony is vital to a successful .
ytrial. He will make every effort to build Rowe's confidence,

RE: . TESTIMONY. BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE ‘THE.
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

(8).. A history of Congressional oversight of. the Bureau.
Mr. Marvin asked that we identify. those Subcommittees of Congress ~
which have exercised some oversight responsibilities. cover. the
. Bureau. In particular, he asked that we review appropriations
testimony going. back ‘to 1955. to determine whether we discussed
. topics which ‘are presently of concern to: the Select Committees.
This will be very useful in demonstrating Congressional aware-
ness of these matters. He also asked that we ‘furnish ‘a statement -
o£ the Director's. position concerning Congressional oversight -
which he has: previously. expressed in speeches or testimony
before Congress.

(4) .A list of major investigative ‘techniques. employed
by. the Bureau, specifying in each ‘case whether we seek Depart~
mental approval. . The more obvious. examples are electronic
surveillance,: use ‘of body recorders, pen registers, informants.,
and photographic surveillances.

(5) A list of any formal or informal proposals which have
been made. ‘concerning, organizational. changes. of the FBI. ' Examples -
are ‘the ‘creation of an Inspector General's Office in the Depart-
ment or. elsewhere having review authority over. the FBI, transfer
of counterintelligence functions to: another agency or. the creation

. of a separate Division within the Bureau for that function, trans-
- fer of drug enforcement responsibilities to the Bureau, and the
proposed statutory limitation on the term of the office for. the
Director.

It should bé noted that several position papers concern-
ing such topics were prepared at ‘the request of former. Acting
Director L. Patrick Gray which might be useful in responding. to.
this request..

Although no date has been set for the Attorney General's
. testimony, it is expected that he will testify after Mr. Kelley's -
appearance on 12/9/75. In view of the ‘limited time available,
Mr. Marvin asked that we expedite ‘the preparation of these
materials and furnish ‘them to his office as soon as. ‘they are
completed. It is requested that ‘these materials be submitted
. to the Office of Congressional Affairs, when completed, but no
later than cob, Friday, 11/28/75: . They should be submitted in
insert ‘form suitable for inclusion in a letterhead memorandum.

_ U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMETTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC letter dated November 7,
1975, and specifically to Item 1 of an accompanying Document
Request of same date which requested ail materials contained
in the files of William C. Sullivan pertaining to Martin Luther
King, Jr., and/or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) which have not previously been made available to the
Committee. Excluded from consideration in connection with this
request were any portions containing transcripts or summaries
or tapes of electronic surveillances of King.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery’
to the SSG of materials in response to Item 1 of the Document
Request.

With respect to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some
cases it can be ascertained precisely what information in these
materials came from electronic surveillances of King; however,
there exist areas where documentation of the information is not
precise and no accurate determination can be made. Therefore,

, NO assurances can be given that portions of the materials

being furnished do not contain information developed as a
result of electronic surveillances of King.

In addition to materials not being furnished the
SSC as stipulated by the SSC is a folder classified "Top Secret"
bearing a label captioned "Communications Concerning Martin
Luther King, Jr., Volume 1" which was located in the files of
Mr. Sullivan. A review of that document indicates it contains
information which could result in the identification of confi-

‘ dmtial sources of this Bureau; data obtained in connection with

Dear Mike: 7

As.a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director
Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and
witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's
use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like
to make the following requests.

As discussed in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-
vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence
informant and source program that could be inserted in :
the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at
the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to-
present to the Select Committee a complete description
‘ of its program and to discuss the issues of particular
interest to the Committee members. These include, for
“example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,
including an assessment of the pregram's cost and effective-
» mess, and the distinctions and relationships between the

intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal
informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when

an informant may be used in an organization or group; and
3) the program's command and control system, including the
- limits that are placed on the activities of informants

and the type of information an informant or source is per-
mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.

In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg-
islation in the informant area, such as the imposition

of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-
view. To permit the Select Committee members to study this
memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it
with FBI representatives during their testimony at the pub

| lic’ hearing, we request, that (Ehe memorandum be submitted

mittee, requested the Bureau designate a witness to appear in
executive session before the SState SSTSsE Committee On. 2/3. or.

the afternoon to discuss cou counterintelligence investi-

Vgations by thé Buréau-” E1liff stated because of Chairman Frank
Church's interest in a study as to whether counterintelligence
investigations should be taken out of the FBI and placed in
another agency or a separate component of the Justice Department,

. this particular topic would be the main focal point of the hear-
ing. El1liff stated that the questions asked of the Bureau's
witness would deal primarily with the feasibility of removal of
counterintelligence out of the FBI including problems of a
logistical and practical nature resulting from such a change.
Elliff asked that he be advised as to the identity of the Bureau
witness as soon as possible.

Inasmuch as the aforementioned topic is_a_ questi
policy, the Director may desire to appear or designate cei
witness. tO” appéar “pétore thé Committee in this “matter. Michael E.

John T. E1liff, Domestic Task Force Director of tha" **”—
Senate Select Committee, advised at 9:15 a.m. on 12/3/75 that .
the following is a statement to be read by Senator Frank “Ue#

of that Committee on 1273/75. lg
4,

Attorney General Kennedy authorized wiretaps in
1962 on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin and his
secretary and that lasted for about one month. In tevin tn ff &
to the wiretap on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin in Leys €
1962, the Committee has received materials from the FBI re-
flecting authorization by Attorney General Kennedy of a gay
wiretap on a reporter for Newsweek Magazine in 1961 during
the investigation of another leak of classified information.
Further materials reflected authorization by Attorney General
Nicholas Katzenbach for a wiretap on the editor of an anti-
Communist newsletter in 1965, also during the investigation
of a leak of classified information. The Committee has received
materials from the FBI reflecting authorization by Attorney
General Robert F. Kennedy of wiretaps on at least six American
citizens, including. three Executive Branch officials, a Con-
gressional Staff Member, and two registered lobbying agents
for foreign interests. The materials also reflect that these
wiretaps relate to an investigation of agents by foreign in-
terests. to influence United States economic policies.

E1liff was advised by SA Paul V. Daly of this Division™
that an impression would be created by the aforementioned statement
that this Bureau may have conducted an electronic surveillance on
Capitol Hill and that this, of course, was inaccurate. The elec-
tronic surveillance concerning. the Congressional Staff Member was
not located on Congressional property. EL1liff agreed with this
observation and indicated that he would check the material to
insure the electronic surveillance in questhor-was=tot on Con-
gressional property and as agreed, make a change in
