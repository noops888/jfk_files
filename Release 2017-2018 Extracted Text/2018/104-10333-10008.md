CIA JFK Collections

1) Oswald 201 file: 17 boxes (Aug 93/Jan 94 Release)
1) JFK hard copy, 63 boxes (Aug 93/Feb 94 Release)

2) JFK microfilm, 72 reels (currently under review)

The Microfilm Reels contain the files that the HSCA staff
either requested or had access to. A great deal of the
material is duplicative of that found in the 63 hard copy
boxes including the complete Oswald 201 file. There are
also files not related to the assassination story and files
not reviewed by the HSCA.

HGR has reviewed all the microfilm material (page by page)
with the exception of the Oswald 201 file. The Microfilm
collection has been divided into to two parts:

1) documents reviewed for release and being prepare
for NARA (records related to the assassination, the
investigations, or the various conspiracy theories) ,

2) documents reviewed but being held pending
discussion with the board (see attachment) .


Microfilm Material Not Processed for Release (Pending
Discussion with the Board) :.

Oswald 201 File - this appears to be a duplicate of the hard
copy 201 file reviewed in 1993. 12+ Reels/approximately
30,600 pages

CIA Staff Employees' Personnel Files - Approximately 10,800
pages located on 7 different reels. Request that these file
not be considered part of the JFK collection as a matter of
privacy. Only a small portions of these files have any
relevance to the JFK investigations and we believe that the
documents related to their roles in the JFK story were
released in the JFK hard copy collection. We have reviewed
each of the OP files and prepared a classified summary for
the Board.

Non-Related Material - Most of these documents fall into
three major categories:

Individual 201 files : These files cover the entire
period of agency interest or contact with a person. For
individuals who are not "key figures" in the JFK story,
those sections of the file that are outside relevant time
frames or can not be linked to Oswald, the assassination,
the various investigations, or any of the conspiracy
theories have been treated as non-related.

Project/Operational Files: Many of these cover the
complete life of a project. Sections of these file deals
with operations which have no connection with the
assassination or fall in only part of a relevant time frame.
For example there are over 3000 pages on the Mexico City
Photo operation covering the 1960's and 1970's. The only
related material is that falling in the time frame of
Oswald's visit to Mexico City and the investigation
following the assassination.

Cuban Exile Groups/Operations: The anti-Castro
activities of the Cuban exiles in the us during 1960 - 1963
are considered relevant to the assassination. However, some
of the organizations and individuals members continued to
run operations against Castro into the 1970's. The exile
activities after the assassination are generally not
considered related unless they involve plots to assassinate
Castro, the continuation of pre-assassination projects or
the Garrison Investigation.


Notes:

I did not address the financial records of the CRC that we
are replacing with a summary (need to review again); we will
probably have to wait until we meet with the full board to
get their thinking on summaries.

There are other categories/types of documents that are non-
“related but do not fit in the above categories. For
example, the HSCA requested files on 29 on defectors; they
chose only 11 for their defector sample to be compared with
Oswald. We treated the 11 as related and the rest as non-
related. However, the number of pages involved is small
compared to the above three categories. =

UIA SPECIAL CULLEC LLUNS
RELEASE IN FULL
2000

Assassination Review Board

Second Public Meeting, 12 July 1994
Room 105, NARA

Official Attendees: Members of the Board, Steve Tilly, NARA.

Public: 25/30 in attendance including four from FBI (Terry
& Grant), Lesar, and Newman. Also one network
(ABC?) rep.

Purpose: Transact official business, briefing form Tilly on
recent releases; discuss future board activities

Selected items of HRG Interest:

I spoke with Jack after the meeting. Ex. Director MARWELL
will be on board 8 Augusts; they expect to be in new offices
by 15 August and have a core staff in September. Jack said
(after meeting) he would like to meet us last part of
August/early September.

Tilly said that the CIA would be releaseing 70,000 pages
later this summer (he ask me before the meeting if July was
still a good date -- I said "no"). He also mentioned the .
20,000 pages of HSCA material in our files that we would be
reviewing this summer.

2

FBI received praise from the board; not much discussion of
CIA. DOD agencies are now the "bad boys". Hall ask several
pointed questions about the "small" DOD releases then Newman
blasted NSA and DIA during the question period.

Items/Issues addressed by the Board during the meeting:

Announced appointment of Executive Director David G. MARWELL
(see bio sheet). Will be on board 8 August.

Passed resolution extending the Board to October 1995
MOA signed with the White House - funds through Sept. 1994

Discussed status of items before Congress (extending the
Board to October 1996 and funding). Funds included in House
version of appropriation bill/deleted from Senate. They
assume that the -funds will be restored in Conference;
however, could be reduced which would impact on number of
public meeting to held outside of Washington.

Expects to move into new office space by mid-August and have
a core staff in place in September. The bulk of the staff
would come on board in October.


Plans to begin public hearing on defining an assassination
record in Sept. Anna Nelson commented on the importance of
identifying what is a record before beginning to address
specific issues/documents.

William Joyce reported that he had sent letters to 55
agencies asking about the quaintly of records still held by
the agency and had received 20 responses several which had
identified additional sources for documents (no specifics)

Steve Tilley gave a briefing on status of releases.

Releases since last meeting include tapes of telephone calls
from the Johnson Library, the FBI files, Church Committee (7
boxes), and DOJ's FOIA litigation files. This month an
additional 10 boxes of Church Committee and some Pike
Committee Files (only a small part deals with JFK). Expects
a release from the CIA of approximately 70,000 pages later
this summer (mentioned the 73 Reels).

Tilley also described the 20,000 pages of HSCA material in
CIA files and that NARA would be acting as House agent on
these record.

Questions (to Tilly) by the Board:

Size of the NARA collection? - 1200 Cubic Feet (2500 pages
per foot)

(Jack) what was the number of documents with redactions? --
Steve said he could not give a figure, would guess less than
50%

(Graff) any problems with agencies' willingness to release
documents -- None, considers the work be the various
agencies as a remarkable effort to turn over records. The
problem was the volume of material and the time it takes to
review.

A question about Senate and House Committee reviews
procedures led to a discussion where it was clear that
neither the Board nor Tilly had a good fix on that part of
the review. The point was made that CIA information in
those documents (and in our HSCA material) would be reviewed
by CIA reviewers; the originator of the information was the
key reviewer) .

(Jack) how were the agencies doing in defining
“assassination records? -- Tilly described some of his
discussions about assassination records within NARA and with
other agencies. He mentioned that the "major agencies" had
records that they felt fell outside the scope which they
planned to discuss with the board.


(Hall) how was the cooperation of the DOD intelligence
agencies including NSA / how much had they withheld ? --
Tilly said he found them cooperative but that the release
was small. Did not know off hand how much was withheld.
Hall considered so few record as "suspect" and ask if NARA
had followed up. Tilly said no. NARA did not have the
authority to question the agencies about their searches. He
indicated that the Army among others had not responded to
NARA's initial request. (During the public comments part of
the meeting Newman and Lesar returned to the question of DOD
compliance.)

Several members of the Board had questions about the
Presidential Libraries; Tilly described his role and the
process. :

When Jack open the meeting for public comments, Newman
returned to the question about DOD releases. He clamied
that NSA had release only one true document and that most of
the DIA files was administrative or news clipping. He said
he had seen at least 30 DOD documents in CIA and FBI files
that did not appear in the DIA release.

Newman then ask if the agencies could withhold documents
from the Board; Jack responded that under the law thar only
Board had the power to withold a document.

Lesar ask if the Board had given consideration to.his letter
concerning the definition of an assassination record. Jack
thanked him for the letters but the Board would not be able
to address the issues Lesar raised until they had a staff to
do the research.

A third "expert" named Mark Zaid ask a question about Post
Office files that had been released before and how they
compared with recent Post Office files found by NARA. Anna
responded that such questions require a staff.

AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

1@ Avayss JAY em

I, Preparation of Materials

A, The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will cooperate fully
in the investigations conducted by the Select Committee on Assassinations
(Committee) by providing access, as requested, to classified information
within the releasing authority of the CLA, and held by the CIA, that bears
upon the study and investigation authorized by H. Res. 222. CIA will
notify the Committee of any requested information held by CIA not
within the releasing authority of the CIA, and notify the Committee of the
proper authority to contact to obtain the information. No document or a
portion of the document in the possession of CLA will be withheld without
written notice of that action to the Committee, Access to all classified
information designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the
Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and currently held by any federal
agency or department shall be governed by this memgyandum.

B. Documentary material will be made available as expeditiously
and completely as feasible, subject to the responsibility of the DCI to
protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods. The Committee and
CIA will periodically agree upon a list of identities that will not be excised
from materials turned over to the Committee. Subject to the list of
identities that will not be deleted, CLA will appropriately sanitize, including
excising if necessary, information to assure protection of information
identifying sensitive sources and methods. When an excision is made,
CIA will indicate the nature of the source or method excised, including the
functional intelligence discipline which was the source of the intelligence.

C. The Chief Counsel of the Select Committee on Assassinations

and a designated representative of the DCI shall meet monthly to discuss

a random sample of the complete and unsanitized materials selected by
the Chief Counsel for the purpose of verifying the appropriateness of the
sanitizing dong by the CIA, Those matters on which they do not agree
shall be referred to the Chairman, Ranking Minority Member, and the
DCI for resolution. 7

os ¢ ae C

. _B." Upon the termination of the Committee, all materials
provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will be kept and
preserved within a segregated and secure area within CLA for
at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of Representatives
agree to a shorter period of time. All persons having access to such
materials must sign an access sheet indicating the date, the name of the
person receiving access, the specific documents or materials to which
access was granted, and the person who authorized the access.

VU. Disclosure of Information

A. The Committee will notify the DCI in writing of its desire to
disclose, in any manner, including under the Select Committee on
Assassinations Nondisclosure Agreement, any informationthatis . 7
designated for protection from unauthorized disclosure by the DCI,

If within five days the Committee does not receive a letter from the
DCI objecting to the proposed disclosure and stating the reasons for the
objection, the Committee may disclose the information.

B. If the DCI notifies the Committee within five days that he objects
to the proposed disclosure and states the reasons for his objections,
the Chairman of the Committee and the DCI, or their designated
representatives, shall.meet to attempt to resolve any differences over the
information to be disclosed. If the Chairman of the Committee considers
that the negotiations have reached an impasse, he will give the DCla
written notice to that effect, and the Committee will take no steps until
at least 14 days thereafter to disclose the information in dispute.

*C. Any differences left unresolved by negotiatiol’may become the
subject of litigation. .In any such action each party will be free to assert
all its constitutional, statutory, or other legal rights, and the parties
agree to be bound by the final outcome of any such action. If such an
action is commenced by the Executive Branch but is disposed of without
a judicial decision on the merits of the disclosure issue, the Committee
agrees that it will not on that basis, or on the basis of its 14-day notice
letter, disclose the information in dispute. This Agreement, however,
is without prejudice to any of the Committee's other rights, privileges
and responsibilities concerning the production by legal compulsion and
disclosure of information, and the DCI's rights, privileges and responsi~
bilities concerning the protection from disclosure of the information.

Outline of Presentation to the Board
August 6, 1996

L Where we are in the process of CIA records

We have almost completed the Oswald 201 file.
Size 17 boxes E
Postponements have been reviewed word by word

We are now tuming to new areas for CIA records
HSCA collection now housed physically just a few yards from here
To be reviewed word by word
Scelso
Oswald in Mexico City by Hardaway and Lopez
JFK Library
Release this fall of many records related to Cuba

| am pleased to say — and | offer this as my personal opinion -- that | have
seen no example where the Board has postponed any information that
bears directly on the assassination. | believe that the story is coming out
with the records that are being released.

tL. Issue immediately before us is the CIA’s sequestered collection.
Mr. Pereira has described it from the perspective of the agency.

The Review Board staff has been reviewing the record and has given the
Board its own assessment of the status of the records.

There are a great number of records in the sequestered collection that are highly
relevant:

Lee Harvey Oswald

Georges de Mohrenschildt "”
Elena Garro de Paz

Antonio de Varona (Frente RD)
Silvia Duran

Rolando Cubela

CRC

Bay of Pigs a
Castro assassination attempts
Warren Commission

HSCA

Garrison investigation


-2-

These types of records need to be reviewed on the same word-to-word basis as
the board has reviewed records thus far.

But we have a new problem: how should the Board review records from the
sequestered collections where the relevance to the assassination is not clear.

Examples where the staff has difficulty finding a nexus to the
assassination in certain records.

| will offer a few examples to provide you with a flavor of some of the issues we
are confronting. The examples below are hypothetical and are loosely based
upon our review of the files in order to illustrate the issues.

A. The “false hit” category

The HSCA requested files from CIA on a great number of persons. Inmany ~
instances the agency did not know why the files were requested, and accordingly
it made available files that it had on the name that had been requested.

Because names are not always unique, the agency sometimes made available
files on individuals who were of no interest to the HSCA and who had no
identifiable relation to the assassination.

ao A very common name —- | will use as an example the name Robert Smith.

The HSCA requested Robert Smith files because of an alleged
connection between a “Robert Smith” and Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.
The Smith whose file was made available, however, was a CIA officer who
died in 1956. The ARRB staff has reviewed the file and has discovered
no relevance to the assassination.

B. CIA operational files or 201 files.

2. Cuban now living in the United States. CIA unsuccessfully attempted to
recruit her to collect information on Cuba through her family and friends,
but ultimately abandoned the effort. Neither she nor any of her hoped for
contacts had any identifiable connection to the Oswald story or to the JFK
assassination.

3. Cuban cultivated for operational work against Castro in whom CIA lost
~ interest when he was not able to meet operation standards.

4. Soviet official at the Mexico City embassy during Oswald's visit, although
he never had any personal contact with him. The Mexico City portion of
his file ha been reviewed and. released in part to NARA. The remainder of


~3-

his file covers his subsequent career in a European country, where CIA
monitored him closely. This portion of his career - by far the largest part
of his file - has no bearing on Oswald or the JFK assassination.

C. CIA officials

There are many personnel files of CIA officers. The files often contain medical
records evaluations, recommendations, and postings. They generally do not
contain any operational details.

5. CIA employee who was a Headquarters secretary for a major figure in the
case. Her file consists of personnel records, medical records, and a
polygraph, none of which has any identifiable bearing on the Oswald story
of the JFK assassination.

As anyone knowledgeable about the Kennedy assassination can testify, there is
a bewildering number of allegations regarding CIA officials who have alleged
connections to the assassination. The HSCA investigated some of these leads.
Not all leads are successful.

6. ACIA officer was allegedly in Dallas on November 22. An examination of
the file suggests that the individual was not in Dallas, but was in Vietnam.
There is nothing in the file that contains any apparent connection to the
assassination.

te CIA official in Mexico City who was directly involved in matters related to
Oswald's visit. Prior to and subsequent to the Mexico City tour, the officer
was stationed at headquarters and at other locations in the world. With
the exception of the portion related to Mexico City, the staff can identify no
other documents that illuminate the assassination.

D. Summary of problems °
First, establishing criteria for relevance
Second, handling different types of records
ex. 1: entire file has no identifiable relevance

ex. 2: some documents in a file have relevance, but others do not

ex, 3: portion of a document has identifiable relevance, but others do not

Selected Statutory Provisions in The President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V
1994)

Definition of Assassination Record

“Assassination record’ means a record that is related to the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy, that was created or made available for use
by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of [the HSCA].”
Sect. 3(2).

Interpretation 1: All records in segregated collection are assassination records.

Argument: the segregated collection are “assassination records” because
a goverment agency examined them in the course of their investigation
of the assassination.

Interpretation 2: Only segregated collection records that actually relate to the
assassination of President Kennedy come within the scope of the JFK Act.

Argument: In order for a record to be an “assassination record” it must:
(a) relate to the assassination of President Kennedy, and (b) have been
used by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of a
government agency.

Selected CFR Provisions:

“All records collected by or segregated by all Federal, state, and local
govemment agencies in conjunction with any investigation or analysis of
or inquiry into the assassination of President Kennedy ....” 36 CFR
1400.1 (b)(2)

”
“An assassination record shall be released in its entirety except for
portions specifically postponed pursuant to the grounds for postponement
of public disclosure of records established in . . . the JFK Act, and no
Portion of any assassination record shall be withheld from public
disclosure solely on grounds of non-relevance unless, in the Review
Board's sole discretion, release of part of a record is sufficient to comply
with the intent and purposes of the JFK Act.” 36 CFR 1400.5. -


-5-

Vv. Staff Preliminary Suggestions to Board
A. Factors suggesting possible relevance to assassination:

Unfortunately, there is no simple, clear, obvious method for determining
relevance. Accordingly, rule of thumb guidelines need to be followed.
The obvious rules of thumb to assist staff in identifying relevant
documents would include:

-- documents that obviously are related to assassination
CIA intemal investigations
Oswald records
Garrison investigation
Castro assassination attempts

~- documents falling within certain dates (relevance of dates depends on
issue under consideration
dates associated with Oswald
dates immediately around assassination
dates of Warren Commission
dates of Church Committee, HSCA investigations

-- individuals of importance
CIA officials in Mexico City
David Atlee Phillips
Win Scott
CIA officials in HQ involved in investigation
John Scelso
JJ Angleton

-- geographical relevance (USSR; Cuba; Mexico)
B. Handling of records in sequestered collection
First, ARRB staff reviews all records and files in sequestered collection.

Second, all documents that are found to be relevant will be subjected to
word by word review of postponements by the Board. The staff will, over
time, work with the Board to establish guiding criteria for identifying ~
relevance. The focus will be on individuals and groups that have been
identified as playing a role in the larger story of the assassination.
Examples of individuals who have been identified as being a part of the
greater story surrounding the assassination include David Atlee Phillips,
Win Scott, James Angleton, etc. Groups include Cuban exile groups


-6-

(DRE, Alpha 66, etc.), Minutemen, etc.

Third, for a file where no relevance can be found, the staff will write a
memorandum identifying the file, describing the review process, and
explaining the basis of finding no relevance. The staff memorandum will
then be sent to the JFK Collection and be made fully available to the
public.

Fourth, for a file containing some relevant records, the relevant records
will be subjected to the word by word review. Records for which the staff
has been able to identify no relevance, a memorandum will be written to
describe generally the type of records and explain the basis for finding no
relevance.

Fifth, with regard to the microfilm copy of the Oswald 201 file, the staff will
review the entire file in order to determine whether there are any records
in the file that are not included in the released version of the 201 file. If

- such records are identified, they will be subjected to the same word by
word review as other records -- but the remainder of the 201 file will not
be reviewed again.

Sixth, in rare cases, portions of a document that genuinely have no
identifiable relevance to the assassination, may be redacted consistent
with the 1400.5.

| recommend that the Board, in the near future, deliberate on the guidance that it
wishes to give to the staff regarding these matters.

Introduce CIA participants

We are pleased to provide information to the Assassination
Records Review Board that might assist the Board in fulfilling
its responsibilities under the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act. CIA is committed to full
cooperation with the Board.

Before addressing the subject of the sequestered collection
directly, I would like to provide some background to help put
the sequestered collection into some sort of context.

In the spring of 1992, prior to the enactment of the JFK
Assassination Records Act, then Director of Central
Intelligence, Bob Gates issued instructions to begin reviewing
for declassification all records related to the assassination.

The CIA History Staff was charged with identifying the
relevant records. Once this was done, the Historical Review
Group took custody of these records and immediately began
reviewing them for declassification for release to the National
Archives.

Once the Kennedy Assassination Records Act was passed, our
goal became to release as many of the records as possible by the
22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act. Approximately
125,000 pages were transferred to the National Archives by that
date.

“3 f With subsequent releases, CIA has now declassified and
transferred some 227,000 pages of material to the National
Archives. Based on discussiens with the Board, we are
continuing to release additional information that had been
redacted earlier.

The remaining records are in various stages of review.
Some require review by other agencies. Some is congressional
material. Final decisions on other records are awaiting
discussion with the Review Board.


THE INATIO!

In identifying relevant records, we have followed the
definitions in. the 1992 Act and the related rules which were
pwbhFished in the Federal Register.

The Kennedy assassination records in CIA consist of two
major groups of files. One group consists of the documents in
the Lee Harvey Oswald file--sometimes referred to as the “Oswald
201 file”. These consist mainly of documents collected after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission investigation.

There are about 26,000 pages of material in the Oswald
file. All but a handful have been declassified and sent to the
National Archives.

The second group is comprised of the “sequestered
collection”. These are the records that were made available to
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and which the
Committee asked CIA to hold in safekeeping upon the completion
of the Committee's investigation.

Certain additional records, including 400 excerpts from

minutes of the.Director’s morning meetings, and some working
files, have been added to the overall collection since 1992.

”

yl
ca


SEQUESTERED COLLECTION

First of all, every document in the sequestered
cM Fection is available to the Board for review. ‘The
documents are available in full, without redactions.

The record shows that the sequestered collection
consists of documents compiled in connection with the
investigation of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA).

A portion of the documents were created specifically in
response to requests from the HSCA. Other records were
already in existence prior to the creation of the Committee.
Still other documents were created by the Committee itself.
For example, notes of interviews conducted by the
Committee’s staff.

Within the sequestered collection there are two major
categories of records. One category consists of
approximately 129,000 pages of hard copy. The second
category consists of 72 reels of microfilm, or the
equivalent of 163,000 pages of hard copy.

The reason why the documents were sequestered-is
explained in a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the
Chairman Louis Stokes of the HSCA and DCI Stansfield Turner
in August 1977. The Memorandum provides as follows:

“Upon termination of the Committee, all materials
provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will be kept
and preserved within a segregated and secure area within CIA
for at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of
Ripgésentatives agree to a shorter period of time.”

In April 1979, Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff
Director of the HSCA visited CIA Headquarters to complete
the process of designating what materials were to be
sequestered. All the documents made available to the
Committee were included in the sequestered collection.


ECLASSIF: F THE SEQUESTERED LES

In 1992, CIA wrote to Speaker of the House Thomas Foley
r@§yGesting approval to begin declassifying and releasing the
records. In October of that year, Mr. Foley wrote a letter
to the DCI granting CIA the authority to do so. The
Speaker’s decision was made in anticipation of passage of
the Assassination Records Collection Act.

THE MATERIAL

The hardcopy part of the sequestered collection
includes copies of most of the CIA documents in the Oswald
201 file. Also included are 201 files, personnel files, and
security files on persons who are mentioned in documents
relevant to the assassination, or who figure in one of the
conspiracy theories.

The collection also includes about 30,000 pages of

documents, memos, and notes (many handwritten) that were
created by the Committee staff during their investigation.

vd
a


THE MICROFILM PORTION OF THE SEQUESTERED COLLECTION

As I noted earlier, there are approximately 72 reels of
microfilm in the sequestered collection. (Incidentally, we
haé arranged to have all of the microfilm records printed
in hard copy.)

The decision to microfilm a portion of the sequestered
collection was apparently based on two major considerations:

First, the integrity of the sequestered records
had to be maintained.

Second, a number of the files requested by the
HSCA were active and had to be available to allow people to
continue conducting their normal activities.

The solution was to replace certain records with
microfilm versions. These records were microfilmed during
1979-80 with the approval of the Assassinations Committee.

THE CONTENT OF THE MICROFILM

A sizeable portion of the microfilm--approximately 50
percent--duplicates the hard.copy-files.. For example,- there
are 12 reels of material from the Oswald 201 file.

The bulk of the reels consists of files on
individuals and organizations, including personnel files of
CIA employees. There are also a number of files on anti-
Castro organizations. All but a small percentage of the
materials are CIA-originated cables, dispatches, memoranda,
reports, and correspondence.
a6

There are questions of privacy that we believe the
Board may want to consider in-determining what information
is to be released to the public. Some of the records
contain, for example, medical information on an individual.

There are also questions of relevancy that we suggest
the Board consider. For example, many of the documents
cover sensitive activities that go far beyond the timeframe
of the assassination or investigations into the
assassination. ieee


SUMMARY

--We hope that the Board has found this discussion of
the sequestered documents useful.

--We look forward to continuing cooperation with the
Board as we all work towards releasing as much information
as possible to the American public.

a. Bringing all of release programs into alignment.

b. Realize there are problems - let me read two short
sections from a briefing I have prepared for the DDA and the
EXDIR

Pgs 13, and 19

c. This office is not knee-jerk or Neanderthal in its
approach. We care a great deal about what makes sense
practically and legally

d. In fact we have a significant legal bent in this
office.

Lee is a former OGC attorney.
His FOIA coordinator is an attorney.

I am a former DGC on rotation from OGC

And I have three attorneys assigned to this office
Bruce Burke - Assoc DGC for Information

And two staff level attorneys:

a GS-15 attorney and

a junior attorney.

2. Cover Issue:

a your consideration of our concerns on

b. As I explained when I met with Dr. Gunn on 3
February. There are subjects that seem like open secrets,
if they could be called secrets at all. And certainly, this
is different from a secret like x is a CIA spy in y country.

c. But as the State Department and our station chiefs
have indicated, this is more important that it would seem at
first blush. There are repercussions from official
acknowledgment of certain ~“open secrets.''

d. Which brings me to perhaps a final point:

e. Intelligence information often looks sensitive to
the layman or generalist when the expert will tell you it is
innocuous. And conversely, what seems innocuous to the
layman can be quite sensitive. Our job is to help you
distinguish the one from the other.

£. we rely on you to help us figure out ways to ensure
your job is done and the American people are informed
without doing damage to intelligence equities.
: g. We want to be as forward leaning as possible, and
work out compromises so it is a win-win solution for our
respective organizations and for the American people.

h. We will strive very hard for a cooperative,
harmonious relationship and we are committed to providing
whatever resources are needed, from a very slender resource
base to ensuring that we have met all of your taskings.

Process: First, process - the components own the information and the IRO is the gate-
keeper who controls what will be done, what will be searched, and what will be released.
This makes coordination complex, but the larger issue is that the IRO usually does not
have either the clout or the resources to do the job and we find cases bottle-necked.

Policies: What also makes coordination difficult, is an institutional bias to withhold
until forced to release. Thus, we adopt silly positions. When pressed, we often concede
in the end, but we lose credibility in the process.

Sixth, Capture of Previously Released Information: We are trying to complete the job of
populating a data base of previously declassified and released information.

It is not acceptable that those outside the Agency know better than we do, what we have released.
Our MORI database, once fully populated will allow us to:

Satisfy many requesters from information we already have declassified.
Speed up our declassification by knowing what decisions have already been made.
Increase the consistency of our decisions.

And most importantly, avoid wasting resources and embarrassing ourselves fighting to protect -
what already has been released.

And seventh, Classification Policy: The world is changing.

The overall budget figure was a released, but now it is.
It was forbidden to mention the existence of the NRO; that has changed.
All NRO contractors were under cover; now a two page listing of those contractors has been
published in the media.
We tightly protected all overhead imagery program, but we now are declassifying product
from early systems.
On the other hand, we still have policies that are outdated and may no longer make sense - [Farm,
defectors, psychoanalysis, bios, World War II liaison information.]
A small effort can inject fresh thinking, and can staff i issues for periodic and systematic validation by
senior management.
This can pay dividends by keeping us from wasting time and resources protecting and defending what
senior managers believe can and should be released. 19

17 August 1998

Talking Points for meeting with ARRB Executive Director,
Laura Denk -- 4:00 p.m., 17 Aug. 1998

Meeting is primary a “Meet and Greet”

Laura will be looking for reaffirming of commitment to
complete the tasks still outstanding and to meet the
deadline for the Final Declaration. She may also bring up
the subject of a “Memo of Understanding” on what is to be
done after the Board goes out of business.

Current Status:
Sequestered Collection

The re-review is virtually complete-- the remaining material
{approximate two boxes) is mostly security files)

(Note: In the review controversial, complicated or Denied
in Full documents were white-banded for later processing; I
currently have a team of 3 reviewers going through the
collection handling these problem documents. A number of
these could lead to potential appeal issues. It will take
2-3 weeks to complete the white band review.]

Russ Holmes' file
Review -- approximately 2/3 completed
Indexing -- approximately 1/2 completed

Special Requests
Complete -- 22
Continuing -- 10 (searches complete;
material being
collected or
available. for review) =
Outstanding -- 5 All DO

(Note: Two of the outstanding requests (CIA 16 and CIA-IR-
04) are long-overdue priorities that the ARRB staff
requested by completed by 7 August. Laura may raise this
issue. Several of the “Continuing” requests are close to
completion.]

Preparation of Records for NARA
(Board Determination Documents and Release in Fulls)

The pace will pick as I move reviewers from the sequestered
collection to assisting with preparation.

(Note: Will probably need additional resources in September
to complete the task]

Referrals received in last two months of project (We
will try to review as many as possible by end of

Other documents/material that it is not feasible to
review by 30 Sept. or extremely time-consuming for
both staffs and marginal to the story (examples:
Mexico City tapes, card files that duplicate
information in the file)

Other Topics for Discussion

Final Declaration -- “Who signs” may come up.

Transfer of Oswald classified files to NARA by 30 Sept.
ae of all Release In Full documents to NARA by 30

(Laura changed procedures -- we no longer have to send
through ARRB staff; send directly to NARA.]

Next Meeting - 25 Aug.- Possible Issues

Mexico City Tapes (200+)

Board leaving toward declaring as Assassination Records;
DO's initial response is to object. I have advised DO that
we will need a “defense” for Aug. 25 meeting.

{BDECANTER

Although the release of DECANTER was delayed at last
meeting, I understand the Board still leans toward release.

and asked what was the impact of acknowledging a station

Bill responded “opened up old sores” and the

The balancing of public interest vs Agency needs came up
several times; Marwell commented that even if a document or
item is not important to the Oswald story, the Agency must
still defend.

Bill stated several timed during the meeting “If important y
