crime in Chicago at that time SAM GIANCANA, informed a close
associate that the associate should make contact with "DORFMAN"
in order to obtain a loan from JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA because
"DORFMAN belonged to HOFFA". Althoughw"is fot Known whether
in’ this instance GIANCANA was referring to ALLEN’ DORFMAN or

to his father, PAUL, the distinction would make lit tle
difference,in that both are closely associated” in the insurance
