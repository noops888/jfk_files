5.

The handwriting in the "Flelms note" exhibits

mature pace as laving been written by a person not as

It is noted thatl

has two sons about 22 years of

age and one about 17 years old.

6. Notwithstanding the negative finding about the

handwriting, we have compared the typing in the 'LIFE

Magazine", letter with the typing in the several letters

from

that the "LIFE: Magazine" letter was typed on the same

Agency personnel. 3

7. Furthermore, there are several similaritics

in the construction and lay-out, phraseology, and

general theme of the "'LIFE Magazine" letter and

KATONA's letters to lead to the conclusion that

phrases and clauses in the middle of sentences, (3) the use

of "SPY OUT IN THE COLD"' in at least two instances, and

(1) several instances of appellations such as "701 Class of

''62"' 0- "Agent 701".

be eliminated as a suspect in this matter. It is our

opinion that the "LIFE Magazine" letter was typed on

handle the letter (enclosures) in order that it may be pro-

cossed for latent fingerprints. The copy of the "LIFE

Magazine" letter is a Xerox copy made through a screen,

which indicates that it was probably produced by a Xerox

System mass production printer.

This leads to the specu-

lation that many other copies might have been produced.
