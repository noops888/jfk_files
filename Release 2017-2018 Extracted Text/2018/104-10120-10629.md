6. Notwithstanding the negative finding about the

handwriting, we have compared the typing in the "LIFE
Magazine! letter with the typing in the several letters

from} to the Agency, and it is our conclusion
that the "LIFE Magazine" letter was typed on the same
machin has been using to write letters to

Agency personnel. 3

7. Furthermore, there are several similarities
in the construction and lay-out, phraseology, and

general theme of the "LIFE Magazine" letter and 63
KATONA's letters to lead to the conclusion that

typed the "LIFE Magazine" letter on his own typewrite

§. Some of these similarities, among others: are:
(1) All the paragraphs are indented five spaces in both the
questioned and known letters; (2) the use of hyphenated
phrases and clauses in the middle of sentences, (3) the use
of "SPY OUT IN THE COLD" in at least two instances, and
(4) several instances of appellations such as "701 Class of
162" or "Agent 701".

9. SUMMARY: It is our opinion that KIMSEY can
pe eliminated as a suspect in this matter. It is our
inion that the "LIFE Magazine" letter was typed on

handle the letter (enclosures) in order that it may be
cessed for latent fingerprints. The copy of the "LIFE
Magazine" letter is a Xerox copy made through a screen,
which indicates that it was probably produced by a Xerox
System mass production printer. This leads to the specu-

lation that many other copies might have been produced.
