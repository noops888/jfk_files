ae SUBJECT: “Meeting with Mr. Burt Wides tonite Staff ¢ Member)

--. + 1, Om the afternoon of 17 June 1975, Mr. John. Leader of the
IG Staff visited ‘Mr. Kennedy and asked that the undersigned be present,
Mr. Leader said that Mr. Burt WIDES of the Senate Staff had asked to
see Mr. David Whipple and the undersigned. Apparently Mr.-WIDES
: Jhad read some old files relating to-Africa and wanted to clear up some
* questions, According-to Mr. Leader the discussion would be informal.
_However, it was possible that subsequent discussions would, depending
on what emerged from these discussions, would be before a larger Senate
“Staff Group. The files which Mr. WIDES read were WIROGUE, QJWIN
and one other (unknown). It:was agreed that the undersigned would see
dies : Mr, WIDES to see what he wanted, as WIROGUE/ 1 was run by myself in
the © early 1960's,

.2. At approximately 1615 hours the same day I met with Mr. WIDES.
No other ‘persons were present. Mr. WIDES explained that Mr. William
H Harvey had been asked by Mr. Bissell to look into the feasibility of ee,
“iho. ..’ ‘establishing an "executive action” capability within Staff "D". Aside :
iia :.from the allegations related to Mr. Harvey's activities with relation to *
i Fidel Castro, he, Mr.“WIDES had noted that“Mr. Harvey's Deputy, i
a Justin O'Donnell had gone to the Belgian Congo and had handled an Ment ~
Te : - . encrypted QJWIN, - The asset had a similar background as WIROGUE/1 |.”
Z : and had on one occasion according to the files been approached by WIROGUE/1
in Leopoldville with a proposition to establish what Mr. WIDES believes
is an “execution squad." Moreover, there was a cable in the file relating
to the above which stated that "WIROGUE/1 exceeded his authorit
written by the undersigned and sent by Mr, Bronson Tweedy. Mr. WIDES
went on to say that when he was reviewing a summary of the WIROGUE/1
case he noted a statement that WIROGUE/1 would be trained in small arms, *:
‘demolition and “innoculation." Mr. WIDES admitted that since he called

for me he had reread the summary and it was apparent that what was meant _
‘WIROGUE/1 was to get innoculations. Nonetheless, although this may | =~.”
be the case he was interested in WIROGUE/1 possible connéction with
QJWIN, WIRQGUE/1's training, handling and mission.

3. Mr. ‘WIDES said he knew, from the file that WIROGUE was’ woe
originally trained for 4 SB mission, which was canceled, -he had received cae
ie . ‘raining for that mission and later Messrs. Edward Wellsjand@ Lester Houck ~
: "had met ‘with -him and decided to pick him up for utilization in the Congo, | «
i . He also knew that I had handled him while in the U.S., met him in Frankfurt
and briefed him prior to his dispatch to Leopoldville. Also that while in ~.- s: -
“.“": the U.S. WIROGUE had undergone Plastic surgery, Mr. WIDES asked {30° ~
‘* specifically what training did WIROGUE receive and what was his mission. ~
I told him that I had, forgotten after thirteen years about his plastic surgery -
‘@ nose Job) and this was done as an accommodation to WIROGUE. His i
training in-small arms and démolition was just that and I accompanied him ¢
_at the training site during the training. “I met him in Frankfurt to brief him -
on his new documentation, namely backstopped land to take...
him to Switzerland where a sum of money was deposited in a Swiss bank ~~. *
and a letter of credit was given to him whereby he could enter Leopoldville. ~
His mission was to establish himself, namely by. opening a photoshop :
using the letter of credit, He was to be available to’the Station for para- *
military activities once he was established and the need arose. Unfortunately,
.. WIROGUE, being of a criminal persuasion took the opportunity of the chaos-
- in the Congo to engage in money-making propositions for personal gain,
: didn't follow instructions and became a handling problem. The Station. _
oe nee recognized in a short period of time that WIROGUE needed a full-time =~:
neue handler and didn't have the luxury of manpower to do so. He was eventually
’ yetumed to the U.S. and terminated, As for the comment of “execution
“ squads" I simply did not recall it but if he was contacting people én his. .
own he probably did exceed his authority. Mr. WIDES asked if WIROGUE .. .:
received "special handling" as opposed to other agents. I replied that ino: =
a sense he did as WIROGUE was a stateless person who required careful =. -
supervision. On the other hand, Lester Houck was enamored with this
chy personality and wanted to ensure WIROGUE was kepthappy. .-

4.Mr, WIDES than zeroed in on Qywin, wanting to know if I knew the
case, or that Justin.O'Donnell was handling him and if so what was his
mission, I told him that QJWIN meant nothing to me nor was I aware that _
O'Donnell handled him;as a matter of fact I do not recall O'Donnell being
in the Congo.. Upon probing I explained that I was not the Desk Officer
for the Congo and was assigned to another section within the Branch, <"
Only reason I was given the WIROGUE case was due to a decision by



Lester Houck who felt that a Case Officer having European experience
have the case which I had, Mr, WIDES asked if Mr. Wells saw all the ”

_ WIROGUE traffic. I responded that as Mir, Wells was responsible for

__ the Congo, undoubtedly he did.’ He then asked if Messrs. Tweedy and

Houck would see it. Again affirmative.. Mr. WIDES then reviewed the
Lumumba arrest and subsequent assassination and asked if I knew if

i either QJWIN or WIROGUE were in any way involved .. I replied in the

i ". negative.- ;

53s ‘Mr. ‘WIDES then harked back to the “innoculation" training.

He explained that he has swom statements that the use of biological

"warfare was contemplated in the Congo and wanted to know if WIROGUE oa
was trained in these techniques. I stated categorically that to my know-..
ledge WIROGUE was never trained in these techniques, nor was I aware ]
they existed or.ever considered. Mr..WIDES assured me they did, however
his interview was simply to see if there was a connection between QJWIN ©
and WIROGUE and to clear up this little question of “innoculation" bedsnacl
admittedly was resolved seats the interview began.

: &, A final note, Mr. WIDES asked if Mr. Glenn Fields was : Mie
i.’ Tweedy'ts Deputy while I was in Africa Division, I said yes. Then Mr. :
: " WIDES thanked me and said that the matter was cacianae 7
