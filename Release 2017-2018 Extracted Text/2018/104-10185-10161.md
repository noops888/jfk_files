obtained from Marto MONPEFORTE Toledo, who attended as a Mexican
delegate, Unfortunately befcre this report could be disseminated,

Nonteforte, on arriving an Arica, slready had a plan

zone; Tristan de ATHAYDE and Jorge AMADO for
Brazil; Juan Carlos ONETTI and Jose Luis ROMERO
for the River Plate area; Jose Santos GONZALEZ
Vera and Fernando ALEGRIA for Chile, Peru and
Bolivia.

d.. The ‘affiliation commission will form the initial
body of writers of che Community within a six-month
period. Thereafter, acceptance of new members will
be suspended for six months, but will then be renewed
in order to facilitate the work of organizing the
Second Congress of the Latin American Cultural
Community.

Carlos Pellicer and Juan Rulfo are respectively the president
and vice-president of the Asociacion de Escritores Mexicanos,
A.C. (Association of Mexicin Writers = AEMAC), see MEXI-6177
of 5 February 1966, an organization dedicated ostensibly to
bettering tne welfare of writers through increased fringe
benefits as well as better publication and distribution of
their works. Its constitution specifically forbade its in-
volvement in political affairs or entanglement with inter-
national organizations. Mario Monteforte is a member of

this organization. During recent months, under. the aegis

of Pellicer and Rulfo, efforts have been underway to revise
this constitution in such a way as tc repeal these provisions
without at the same time alienating those of the members who
are opposed to dropping these provisions. Pellicer, it will
be remembered, attended the COMES meeting in Genoa last year,
at which the formation of the CIE was discussed.

Despite the vagueness of the wording of articles 3, 4 and
5 (see numbering in attached news clipping) there is no
disputing their political. nature. Monteforte alleged to
LICOOKY that he did not feel the wording of these three
articles is beyond the bounds of reason for a “non-political”
organization. LICOOKY concedes that their wording is subject
to the broadest interpretation if Yonteforte should ever louse
the “conductor's baton." Both are guilty of disingenuousness
or at test naivete, since these articles seem to us to be not
only a license, but almost a-battle cry for political militancy
from community members. :

During his trip, Monteforte claims to have met the Chilean
President and the Foreign Minister. The former, with whom
Monteforte discussed the idea of the comunidades, agreed to
write to President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz of Mexico stressing to
him the importance of support for the comunidades. The impli-
cation is that Mexico's financial and moral support for the
next Cultural Congress will be sought in this way,

5.. The organizing commission for the Caribbean section of
the Comunidad iatinoamericana de Escritores (Community of Latin
American Writers - CLE) has begun issuing invitations to both
individuals and organizations to join. The AEMAC has received
such an invitation, but legally. still must ‘change its constitu-

—thon-before-tt-an join, The tetter of Invitation did not ——
“yeprint—the-basic principles of the CCCL to which the invited
organization would be expected to subscribe. Whether this was
a deliberate omission in the nature of entrapment, or whether
it was felt articles such as the atiached had adequately covered
the ground, is not known.

6. Owing to LICOOKY-1's planned departure from the area
the end of June 1966, it is not likely Station will have the
same insight into the progress of the CLE.

of the prosress of our association with LICOOKY-1. When the
proposed amendment to the LIREAM Project involving LICOOKY was
turned down, we informed ker on her return to Mexico that we could
no longer justify the continued association at the present rate
since we were simply nol yetting enough out of it, but that if
She could rsgularize her status here and obtain working papers, we
would be more than happy to conclude a new arrangement with ker.
She felt there was little chance of this, and we then told her we
would conclude our arrangement with her sometime in the summer.

established as 30 June, at which timo al] outstanding financial

cannot parcel her time out to her various interests, and theretore

finds all her time taken up by her unpaid ALHAC duties. The profiles

we have been harping on Have not materialized eacept for the one

3. The advance made her at Headquarters is being held.
over her as an inducement to give us the balance of her time
before departure and finish in a blaze of activity. If she
does this, we will write off the advance here. If she does
not, $195 of the advance will be counted as her February
salary, $48 as travel expenses from New York to Washington
and the remainder will be written off. : z

4, Rather than go through the formality of a project
amendment as per HNMW-14517, Station would prefer merely to
consider the project as terminated as of 31 December 1966 and
pick up subsequent costs in LIRANCH, A formal project ter-
mination will be submitted in the near future.

LICOOKY Project Progress Report
1 October 1965 = 30 April 1966 i

Production
a. LICOOKY-1 has continued to devote the bulk of her”

: E time to the Mexican Writers’ Association (AEM). She
continues to handle most of its administrative work.
i She also organizes and does most of the work on the
majority of the projects or activities which the
AEH sponsors.
b, L-1 continued to report on efforts to establish the
Latin American Writers’ Community (CLE), iheluding
the results of the Organizing Congrese in Arica, Chile.
She reported on the steps taken by Mario Montefort
Toledo in beginning preparations for an early 1967
Congress in Mexico and on the AEM's probable role in
helping organize that Congress.
¢."-L-1 supplied information on reactiona among the Cen-
tral American community in Mexico to the Guatemalan
election campaign and results.
d. She maiatained contact with and reported on individuale

of interest to the Station, including Monteforte Toledo,

Carlos Pellicer Camara, Manuel Germfin Parra, Francisco

vil

ran Kramer, and Radl Osegueda Pelala.

ada ste ppanaisp Pole be



ane i a a St Aton ne San

LICOOKY-2 continued to report travel of Communists

or leftists from Central America to Eastern Europe.

During this period he reported on eight such travelers.

2. Operations . E -
a. L-1 has been notified that she will be terminated

eifective 30 June. She has been given the following

requirements to be fulfilled before that date.

Provide profiles on the personality and politics of

significant Mexican and Central American intellectuals

with whom she is acquaintec.

Obtain information on the newly-formed Latin American
Writers’ Community, its probable political development,
and progress toward the holding of its scheduled meet-

ing in Mexico City in January 1967. _

Obtain a copy of the analysis written by Ra@l Osegueda

Pelala of the problems of authonomous universities.

Special tasks such as reporting on the activity of

Stast{a Madrigal and on the UNAM student strike.

b. In order to accomplish the above tasks in the short

time remaining, L-1 will be forced to curtail her ac~

-2-


tivities at the AZM. There are enough jobs that

need ‘doing at AEM to occupy her full-time and there-
fore the immediate partial withdrawal from AEM work

ig a prerequisite to the accomplishment of th
assignments.

Because L-1 has played euch a key role in all AEM
activities, and therefore in determining the direc-
tion and scope of these activities, her sudden a
drawal could result in important changes within AEM,
Any major change in direction by AEM would probably
become predictable once the identity of the person

or persons who will move in to fill the vacancy left
by L-1 become known, By having L-] step aside now,
rather than waiting until she is ready to leave Mexico,
he may then be able to provide Station with an ac-
curate account of any change resulting from her with-
drawal.

L-2 has not been met regularly since 25 January. On
that dateshe was given a mailing address which she uses
to request a meeting only if he has information to
report. L-2 is paid on a piece-rate basis for infor~

mation supplied and does not receive a regular salary.

b. It is possible that L-2 will, in the very near future,
lose access to the travel information which he has
been reporting, i cause he is being given new responsi-

‘ bilities in the office where he works, L-2 is intelli-
gent, conscientious, and well-notivated, If he does
lose his present access, the Station will consider him

for other assignments in which he could oe useful.

meeting Peliicer explained how he had been elected

President of the CLE for Latin America and detaiied

“his pians for hosting the CLE Conference in Mexico

City in early 1966.

LICOOKY-1 had tipped off some of her rightist, friends | ~
on the AEM Beard of Directors who immediately pro-

tested. . Instead of anything being arranged a com-

mitiee of two was appointed to investigate and re-

port back to the Board of Directors at a meeting to

he held during the middle of October. This committee

is composed of ins Segura Willén and dee) Martinez
Sotomayor, friends of LICOOKY-1 who have assured

LICOOKY-1 they will return a negative report opposing
Pellicer's plan to use the AEM as host for the 1966

meeting of the CLE in Mexico,

azine. LICOOKY-1 had been told prior to her de- -
parture that the CO gid not know if Headquarters
would want to contact her in Kew york. If she

branch.

An operational dispatch covering LICUCKY-1's activities in the AEM

be
in detaii was prepared and forwarded, Tso HMMs were prepared covering
the organization of the AEN and Juan Rulfo's planning in conjunction
with Carlos Pellicer Cfmara (not to be confused with Carlos Menuel
Pellecer), Migual Angel Asturias, Arnoldo Orfila Reymai, and Benjamin
Carriér for the Congress of the Conmunity of Latin american Writers
(CLE - Comunidad Latinoasericana de Esccvitores) to be held in Mexico
J City in 1966.

d, LICOUK{-1 provided information on ESLIMS-1 prior to his recruitment

which suppaemented that given by LINLUCK. (LICUOHY-1 recommended ageinst

the direct recruitnent of ESLIME-1 for reuscas which later proved to

be true.) . 5

for the CLS Congress, the developments within the ADM, and sill maintain
her contacts with Central American Communists and exiles in Mexico City.

because her access has been limited for the reasons outlined in Para-
graph 5 of Reference A. 7
b. LICOOKY-i has been given the following requirements in regerd to
the AEM:
(1) To prepare complete assessments on all tke influential Aum leaders.

DISPATCH SYMBOL AND Mauaiaee

Shee C1
CUSSIFIEATION



1. The first steps to orgabize the Mexican Writers' Associa-
tion (AEM ~ Asociacién de Escritores de México) were takei a :

in February of 1964 after Bartolome Costa~Amic and the Zaplana

Bookstores published a proposal in the metropolitan newspapers;
offering to establish a new series of library prizes and urging
the Mexican writers to join dn association that could provide
material benefits for its members, The first meeting of the
_AEM was held on 11 August 1964, For some time the AEM remained
as insignificant as other similar organizations which had been
organized from time to time, such as the Society of Literary Au-
thors and The Society of Friends of Mexican Books which never
achieved any effectiveness or respectability. Mexico's established
,

“and well known writers have always shunned these organizations.

2. LICOOKY-1 became interested in the AEM through her friendship
with Costa~Amic and saw the possibility of building the AEM into
an organization which would include the middie of the road and
right wing authors who had been systematically boycotted since
the Lazaro CArdenas' regime when Narciso Lassols, a member of the

Communist Party, was Minister of Education.

3. LICOOKY-1 began a one man campaign of recruiting relatively
well known right wing writers who could not be considered mediocre
or nonentities. “As LICOOKY-1's campaiyn began to succeed it be-

came easier to recruit the nore important writers of Mexico cover~

ing the whole political spectrum, In Octover of 1964, LICOOKY-1

persuaded Carlos Pellicer. Cinara, well kaown Mexican poet,. to
join the AEM, It then became easier to get other well known |
writers to join, In a}l LICOOKY-1 recruited about 80 of the well
known Mexican writers to comeinto the AEM.’ At this time LICOOKY-
1 knew ncthing of the €uropean Community of Yriters (cous -
Comunité Europea degli Scrittori) or. plans to form a Coamunity

of Latin American Writers (CLE - Comunidad Latinoamericana de

Escritores).

4, LICOOKY-1 has been appointed to the Board of Directors of
the AEM which permits LICOOKY-1 to attend all Board Meetings and
she is relied upon to do all details of organization and planning

the AEM projects to assist the Mexican writer which is the ultimate

objective of tne AEM,

5. In this work LICOOKY-1 has developed friendships with the
leaders of the AEM including Pellicer ard Juan Rulfo, both of

whom were Mexican delegates to the COMES Conference held in

Geneva, Switzerland during the winter of 1585. tellicer he

vated LICOUKY-i to his nome and confers wita her on ALM probiers,

usually once a week. Se has free entrance to Rulfo's office at the

Instituto Indirenista and he has visited LICCOKY-1's apartment.

6. Tne Staticn nopes teat through LICCCKY-1 the ALM can be used

$ throuch its affiliate CLE to form

te defeat any attempts dy CO!



a Unity of Writers (UE - Unidad de Escritores) in Mex

Oo as

well as sabotage the CLE Congress to be held in Mexico in 1360.

7. To this end, one of LICOOKY-1's principal objectives is to

solidify her ucceptance in the AEM and she has been given tae "

immediate tauks of:

a.

Preparing complete assessments and personality data on

all of the influential AEM leaders, .

b. Determinins LICOCKY-1's influence on thew as a basis

for;

c.

Using; the AEM, when the time comes, to keep Pellicer

and Rulfe from forming the UE affiliate in Mexico, prepara-

tory to the coming CLE Congress.

Teinge eauindd -tevuatnces

ACTION REQUIRED: Further assessment data requested per para. 2

REFERENCE : HMMA - 25546, 12 March 1965

1. We were especially pleased to receive the LICOOKY/1
target survey on Subject (of 201-12972) and to learn that the
Station bas a controlled asset who enjoys direct, non-profec-
sional, social contact with Subject. As the Station is aware,
Subject's extra-curricular activitiee have become a satter of
increasing CI concern toa number of Stations jn Latin ‘America.
However, none of them appears to have assets in sufficiently
close contact with Subject to detcrmine what be is actually
doing and for whom We realize, of course, that LICOOKY/1 pro-
bably will not be able to shed any light in this regard, but
we hope that her contact can be exploited to provide the type
of personal operational assessment data on Subject which ve
have largely lacked up to now.

2. Our information on Eubject has so far been conflict~
ing onthe point of ais suspected intelligence affiliation and
about his possible susceptibility to recruitment. Nonetheless,
we regard LICOOKY/1's views regarding Subject as objective and
reasonable. During future contacts, we request that she con-
centrate on discerning Subject's persoual attitudes and weak~
nesses cr exploitable vulnerabilities. Siould Subject w trans-
ferred laterally to another location in the West, we would like
to try from the very outset of his assignment to undertake the
type of gradual, long-term developmental contact which LICOOKY/1
suggested. To helpusplan for the selection of an uppropriate
asset for this purpose, we believe it would be useful for
LICOOKY/I to prepara a personality profile onthe type of indi-
vidual to whom Subject is most likely to respond and who could
hepe te grin Subject's friendship and confidence with the
least difficulty or disadvantage.
