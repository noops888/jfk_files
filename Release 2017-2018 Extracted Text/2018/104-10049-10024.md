MEMORANDUM
SUBJECT: -Frank FIORINI - STURGIS'

Following is information from further review of FIORINI's
official file in response to Daniel E. Schultz' inquiry to
the Agency dated 27 September 1973.

There are four volumes to FIORINI's 201 file, the
majority of its content being reports from the FBI dated
from 1958 through April 1969

Agency information includes a cable fron Santiago de Cuba
dated 7 January 1959 stating FIORINI claims to be chief of
26 July Arms: buyer Miami and willing cooperate 100 percent
in supplying info. Cable stated it possible FIORINI may lose
value to rebels but believe worthwhile CIA endorse his staying
on. Hqs CIA replied that FIORINI had been under FBI

investigation for possible registration act violations and

base should deal with FIORINI under strict

and not make any commitments which might later be construed
as USGOVT approval his activities. Wish to reiterate here
that FIORINI was never employed by the CIA.

The following is worthy of note. FIORINI was involved
in NoV/Dec 61 leaflet dropping flights over Cuba. The FBI

queried CIA about allegations that the flights by FIORINI and

Alexander RORKE, Jr., were entirely supported by CIA with CIA
arranging Air/Sea rescue, and that all of FIORINI's actions
were known to CIA Miami and his activities being done on CIA
instructions. Hqs CIA was satisfied allegations not true but
troubled in. view-fact FIORINI was in contact with CIA rep
Florida who used name "Barker" who supposedly gave FIORINI
phone number for CIA Miami office. FIORINI was to call this
number if he was arrested or stopped on flights and CIA would
“get him out". : These Cuban overflights were not authorized
by CIA and. the FBI “Was alerted to fact it was not CIA
operation.. (BARKER was generally known in Miami Cuban exile
community as a CIA source.) Since BARKER was a close friend
of FIORINI, BARKER, shortly before the Bay of Pigs invasion,
was asked. by CIA to attempt to obtain from FIORINI information
concerning FIORINI's activities. BARKER met with FIORINI
several times a month from fall of 61 to July 62. BARKER
insisted when queried by CIA case officer, that he never
revealed classified info or operational data including JMWAVE
phone numbers to FIORINI. FIORINI told BARKER that the
leaflet op was conceived by Sergio ROJAS. A Hqs cable to
JMWAVE dated July 1962 stated that ROJAS had been non-operational

since Feb. 62.
