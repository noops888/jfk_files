MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM

:

Deputy Inspector General

SUBJECT

:

SecurIty Analysis Group

Congressional Investigations of the Agency

1. Per our discussion, I would like to throw out the

following thoughts with relation to establishing a set of

procedures to handle requests from congressional committees

for information, with specific reference to the newly formed

House Committee

to

investigate the assassination of President

Kennedy, et al.:

Al1 requests from Congressional committees

should be directed to a given

focal point within

the Agency. Any requests levied directly on any

other component should not be accepted, and the

requester should be referred to the focal point.

The focal point should initially be com-

prised of Agency officers who have the benefit of

previous experience in dealing with congressional

Investigations, and the assignment of these

officers should

remain reasonably stable in order

to capitalize on this experience factor.

would, inevitably, require a rather long overlap

prior to any reassignments.

An action unit within each directorate

e officially designated to handle congressiona.

nquiries of this nature (I believe this has

already been accomplished) and again,

where

possible,

the experience factor should be taken

into consideration.

All requests received by the focal point

to the appropriate

units within

would be appropriate.)

and slotted to this registry, and for the immediate

future it would be preferable if the two officers

f.

The newly designated Registry should

then

keep complete records on the following:

(1) Copies of all incoming congressional

requests.

(2)

Copies of the focal point's dissemi-

nation of the request to the various action

units within the Agency.

Copies of all responses received from

Copies of the final response to the

(6)

Records pertaining to any material

of a

gation of the Agency. Since it is clear that these investigations

will continue for the foreseeable future, it would seem to me

that we must fall back to our earlier posture of setting up a

unique and

separate organization within the Agency to handle

these inquiries
