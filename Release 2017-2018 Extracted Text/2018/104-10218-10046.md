1. In response to Reference A, the Station notified Headquarters
in Reference B that the $500 monthly subsidy to the LIU? student
organization would cease as of 30 April 1966, Heedquarters believed
thet the April subsidy payment reported in Reference € and charged to
Project LIRANCH vas to be the last payment.

2. Hovever, in both References D and EB, subsidy payments of $500
vere again given to the LIWUFF student orgentzation for the months of
August end September. These expenditures were charged to LILISP-X.
The nost recent renewal requests for Projects LIZUFF ani LILISP-x do
not contain provisions for this subsidy. Meadquarters was under the
impression that the subsidy would not be comtinued and would appre-
ciate the Station's coments.

1. In reference the Station indicated that unless reference
Identity D succeeded In gaining an important ministerial post In
the new Dlaz Ordaz government, the benefits to be derlved from
the ate B. ARLISS-reference tae B contact (l.e., a
continutng indirect connection with the Frente Civico and
incidential information reports) would not be of sufficleat
value to warrant continuation of the contact.

2. To date, as far as the Station Is aware, reference
identity D has not been appotnted to any Cabinet or sub-minister-
lal position. Further, there Is no Indication that former
President Aleman Intends to re-activate the Frente Civico into
@ movement which would be of MHSPAWN Interest at this juncture.

3. ARLISS has accordingly been instructed to phase out the :

contact with reference Identity B and the Frente Civico upon

his return from his U.S. trip In January 1965, Before Lis
departure ARLISS gave reference Identity B an advance of 4000
pesos to cover the two regular monthly payments of 2000 pesos
each for December 1964 and January 1965, When he returns he

will proceed to close out the contact as expeditiously as
possible.
