Dear Walt:

This letter will confirm verbal requests made by Mro3Dwyer
of the Senate Select Committee staff to Mr le-
garding materials pertaining to the assassination of Président
Kennedy.

1. The Senate Select ‘Committee requests a listing of all Mexico
City Station personnel for the period of September through
December 1963. The Committee requests this list on an access
stat, only, to be retained at the CIA for use by the- Committee.
sta

2. The Senate Select Committee requests clarification on what
documents: were filed in the Oswald 201 as of November 22, 1963.
Both Mr. Hartman and Mr. Wall, CI Staff, have stated there were Es
five documents in the file: two Department of State Foreign Dis-
patches (FS Dispatch #806 dated May 5, 1961. and FS Dispatch $317
dated December 12, 1961); one Office of Naval Intelligence memor-
andum (May 26, 1962 from H. T. Hadenberg); and two FBI. Reports. °
Mr. Hartman. stated the FBI Reports were reports of SA John. Fain
dated August 30, 1962 and July 3, 1961. Mr. Wall stated the —
FBI Reports were an October 31, 1963 Report of SA Milton Kaack
and a May 12, 1960 Report of SA John Fain.

3. .(a) Cable traffic from JMWAVE Station to Headquarters fol-
lowing the President’s assassination reveals that JMWJAVE's file
contained information on Lee Harvey Oswald. For example, WAVE 8049
CIN 66782), November 22, 1963, states that AMSPELL files (Cuban
Student Directorate) of JMWAVE have background information on
Oswald. _ The ‘Senate Select Committee requests access to Cuban
Student Directorate files of JMWAVE that contain information on

‘Oswald.

(b) The presence of information on Oswald in AMSPELL files

of JMJAVE suggests the possibility that JNWAVE files on other

Cuban exile groups might contain information on Oswald. The
Senate Select Committee would like to determine if JMNAVE Station
was instructed by Headquarters to review its files for informa-
tion on Oswald and if JMWAVE files on Cuban groups contain any
information about Oswald. The Senate Select Committee requests
access to JMWAVE files on Cuban groups that contain such informa-
tion. .
