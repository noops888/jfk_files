BASIC UNIT IN THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF SOUTH VIETNAM. ALTHOUGH

VILLAGE IS THE COMMONLY ACCEPTED TERM, TOWNSHIP MORE ACCURATELY

DESCRIBES THIS POLITICAL SUBDIVISION, WHICH TYPICALLY EMBRACES

FROM. TWO TO EIGHT HAMLETS AND CONTAINS FROM 2,000 TO 10,000

INHABITANTS.

3. IN THE PAST, VILLAGES WERE RUN BY COUNCILS ELECTED BY AND

FROM WEALTHY FAMILIES. TODAY, WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION. OF BINH

DINH AND PHU YEN. PROVINCES, VILLAGE OFFICIALS ARE APPOINTED BY

HIGHER AUTHORITY, THIS SYSTEM IS NOT WITHOUT ITS DRAWBACKS. IN

QUANG NGAI PROVINCE, THE MEMBERS OF THE VILLAGE COUNCIL WERE

SELECTED BY THE DISTRICT CHIEF ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ANTI-COMMUNIST

POSTURE ALONE, WITH LITTLE OR NO CONSIDERATION FOR THEIR SUBSTANTIVE

QUALIFICATIONS. IN PHUNG HIEP DISTRICT, PHONG DINH PROVINCE,

POLITICAL SCHEMING RESULTED IN THE APPOINTMENT OF VILLAGE OFFICIALS

WHO LACKED EXPERIENCES THEREBY, PROVIDING GRIST FOR THE LOCAL

VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST /VC/ PROPAGANDA MILL... WHEN PRIVATELY POLLED,

SOME INHABITANTS OF THE PROVINCE COMPLAINED OF ABUSES COMMITTED BY

LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR VILLAGE OFFICIALS TO

BE ELECTED DIRECTLY BY THE PEOPLE.

4. ALTHOUGH THERE APPEAR TO BE FEW EXAMPLES OF DIRECT ELECTIONS

OF OFFICIALS AT THE VILLAGE LEVEL,. IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS EVENTUAL

GOAL APPEARS TO HAVE SUPPORT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.

STATED THAT THE INTERMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC HAMLETS

HAD AGREED THAT SELF GOVERNMENT IN THE HAMLETS WAS ONLY THE

FIRST STEP IN A PROGRAM OF BASIC DEMOCRACY, WHICH WOULD BE APPLIED

PROGRESSIVELY UPWARD TO ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. HAMLET ELECTIONS

WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY THOSE FOR VILLAGE CHIEFS, DISTRICT CHIEFS,

"PROVINCIAL COUNCILS, AND, FINALLY, PROVINCE CHIEFS.

5. THE POLITICAL STRUCTURE OF A STRATEGIC HAMLET IS REFLECTED

•IN ITS COMMUNAL CHARTER OR CONSTITUTION. A TYPICAL CHARTER

STIPULATES THAT ALL HAMLET RESIDENTS MUST FIRST BE ORGANIZED INTO

GROUPS ACCORDING TO AGE AND SEX. RESIDENTS ARE ALSO TO BE ORGANIZED

INTO INTERDEPENDENT FAMILY GROUPS, AND AN ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE

WILL BE ELECTED THROUGH SECRET AND DIRECT VOTE. IN SOME HAMLETS

THE TERM OF SERVICE IS 12 MONTHS: IN. OTHERS THE TERM IS INDEFINITE.

THIS COMMITTEE IS CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DIRECTING THE

POLICIES OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE

IS ALSO ASSISTED BY AN ADVISORY GROUP CALLED THE HAMLET COUNCIL,

CONSISTING OF FROM FIVE TO SEVEN MEMBERS, WHO ARE ELECTED BY

HAMLET RESIDENTS THROUGH A GENERAL ELECTION. ACTUAL POWER IN THE

HAMLET APPEARS TO RESIDE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE. ALTHOUGH

THE ELECTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE IS HELD ANNUALLY,

THE RESIDENTS OF THE HAMLET CAN, IF THEY ARE DISSATISFIED, PETITION

THE PROVINCE CHIEF THROUGH THE DISTRICT CHIEF, REQUESTING A NEW .

ELECTION. .

6. THE FACT THAT A HAMLET MAY BE OFFICIALLY LISTED AS COMPLETED,.

DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE HAS

BEEN ELECTED. ONE SOURCE ESTIMATED THAT 2,000 OUT OF ABOUT

3,000 STRATEGIC HAMLETS OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED AS COMPLETED. HAD

HELD SUCH ELECTIONS, BUT ELECTIONS IN ALL HAMLETS WERE HOPED FOR

• BY APRIL 1963. HOWEVER, DO CAO MINH, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, ESTIMATED THAT ELECTIONS IN ANY FORM HAD BEEN

HELD IN ONLY 600 AND NOT MORE THAN 700 OF ABOUT 1800 STRATEGIC

HAMLETS IN WHICH AT LEAST PERIMETER DEFENSES AND BASIC ORGANIZA-

TIONAL WORK HAD BEEN COMPLETED.

7. INITIAL HAMLET LEADERSHIP USUALLY IS. ESTABLISHED BY THE

APPOINTMENT OF A TEMPORARY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BY THE DISTRICT

CHIEF. ONCE THE HAMLET IS IN RUNNING ORDER, THE FIRST ELECTION

MAY BE HELD. CANDIDATES ARE ALLOWED A WEEK. TO ENTER THEIR NAMES

ON THE SLATE AND A WEEK TO CAMPAIGN FOR OFFICE. MEANWHILE,

PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT AUTHORITIES INVESTIGATE THE CANDIDATES

TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY MAY BE VC SYMPATHIZERS OR MEMBERS.

ALTHOUGH THIS PROCEDURE COULD BE UTILIZED TO CONTROL THE OUTCOME •

OF AN ELECTION, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT, OUT OF 50 HAMLET SLATES

•EXAMINED BY THE AUTHORITIES IN PHU YEN PROVINCE, ONLY ONE CANDIDATE

WAS ACTUALLY REMOVED AS UNDESIRABLE; WHILE IN TAY NINH PROVINCE

NO SINGLE CANDIDATES WERE REMOVED. OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY WAS

STILL A PREREQUISITE FOR CANDIDACY IN KIEN HOA PROVINCE; BUT

THIS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE THE CASE IN OTHER PROVINCES.

8. IN PRINCIPLE, NATIONAL ELECTION PROCEDURES ARE FOLLOWED

IN HAMLET ELECTIONS. CANDIDATES SUBMIT THEIR NAMES IN WRITING;

THE VOTE IS CONDUCTED BY SECRET BALLOT UNDER SUPERVISION; AND

THE RETURNS ARE EXAMINED BY AN APPROPRIATE. COMMITTEE. IN ACTUAL

PRACTICE THERE ARE DEVIATIONS, INCLUDING THE USE OF THE HAND VOTE

IN LIEU OF THE SECRET BALLOT.

9. LEGAL PROCEDURES NOT WITHSTANDING, INDIRECT CONTROL OF

HAMLET ELECTIONS IS INDICATED BY A GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM /GVN/.

DOCUMENT, BELIEVED AUTHENTIC, APPROVED BY ALL GVN LEVELS IN APRIL

1962 AND REQUIRING ONLY THE SIGNATURE OF PRESIDENT DIEM FOR

PROMULGATION. IT STATED THAT, IF:THE DISTRICT CHIEF WERE SUFFICIENTLY

'PRUDENT,' THE INHABITANTS WOULD ELECT THE PERSONS SELECTED BY HIM,

ADDING THẠT. A DISTRICT CHIEF MIGHT ALSO USE HIS RIGHT OF VETO BY

REFUSING TO APPROVE THE WINNER AND SUBSEQUENTLY CALLING ANÖTHER

ELECTION: ALTHOUGH THE DOCUMENT CALLED FOR STRICTLY DEMOCRATIC

ELECTIONS OF LEADERS OF INTRAHAMLET GROUPS, IT ALSO NOTED THAT

IF THE VARIOUS CIVIC. ACTION CADRES AND THE YOUTH AND INFORMATION

ACTIVISTS DID THEIR WORK WELL, THE ELECTIONS WOULD NOT TAKE AN •

UNEXPECTED TURN, AND THE PEOPLE WOULD ELECT THE PERSONS SELECTED

BY THE AUTHORITIES.

10. NGO. DINH NHU, AT. THE 9 NOVEMBER 1962 MEETING OF THE

INTERMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC HAMLET, WAS REPORTED TO

HAVE REPRIMANDED. PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT CHIEFS FOR NOT HOLDING

HONEST ELECTIONS FOR CHIEFS OF STRATEGIC HAMLETS, FEARING THAT

A VE OR REACTIONARY WOULD BE ELECTED. NHU. STATED THAT THIS RISK

MUST- BE TAKEN; HOWEVER, IF THIS SHOULD HAPPEN; THE PROVINCE CHIEF

COULD SIMPLY VOID. THE ELECTION ON: THE BASIS OF NONCOMPLIANCE:

WITH THE HAMLET CHARTER, AND CALL ANOTHER ELECTION LATER:

11. IN AUGUST 1962 TWO CIVIE AGTION OFFICIALS IN BIEN HOA

PROVINCE STATED THAT THE VILLAGE AND HAMLET CHIEFS OF THE PROVINCE

WERE NOT ELECTED DEMOCRATICALLY. THEY REPORTED THAT THE RESIDENTS

OF AN BINH HAMLET, BIEN HOA PROVINCE, HAD STATED THAT THE HAMLET

CHIEF, WHO WAS BORN THERE, HAD EARLIER OPPRESSED THEM WHILE SERVING

WITH THE CAO DAI PRIVATE ARMY AND HAD BEEN ELECTED THROUGH AN

ELECTION RIGGED BY THE DISTRICT CHIEF. IN PHUOC HAU HAMLET, PHU

YEN PROVINCE, A PERMANENT EMPLOYEE OF THE PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION

APPEARED TO HEAD THE FIVE-MEMBER HAMLET COUNCIL. IN THE CAM HUNG

REGION OF QUANG TRI PROVINCE, THE GUN WAS FORMING STRATEGIC HAMLETS

AMONG ALL BRU TRIBAL VILLAGES, WITHOUT INFORMING THE TRIBESMEN..

ABOUT LOCALLY"ELECTED HAMLET COMMITTEES, AND HAMLET ADMINISTRATION

REMAINED IN THE HANDS OF THE GVN-APPOINTED HAMLET CHIEF. IN NINH

THE BA BAU HAMLET ADMINISTRATION COMMITTEE, SUBMITTING A LIST OF

THOSE ELECTED. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE ELECTED INDIVIDUALS

WERE UNAWARE THAT AN ELECTION HAD TAKEN PLACE, THAT THEY WERE

SUPPOSED TO SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE, OR WHAT THEIR FUNCTIONS SHOULD

BE. ON THE OTHERHAND, IN VAN THANH HAMLET, TUYEN DUC PROVINCE,

FIVE MEN WERE CHOSEN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE IN A TRULY

DEMOCRATIC ELECTION; HOWEVER, A CLANDESTINE CONTROL MECHANISM

WAS ESTABLISHED, HEADED BY AN INDIVIDUAL KNOWN ONLY TO THE HAMLET

CHIEF, WHO WAS OBLIGED TO DEFER TO THE OTHER'S DECISION IN

EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MILITARY

DEFENSE AND SECURITY OF THE HAMLET, INCLUDING DETECTION OF VC. IN

THE HAMLET AND MONITORING THE ACTIVITIES AND RELIABILITY OF

MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE. HE REPORTED DIRECTLY

TO THE AREA POPULAR FORCES COMMANDER.

12. IN SOME PROVINCES, MOBILE INSPECTION: TEAMS HAVE BEEN

CREATED TO ENABLE THE PROVINCE CHIEF TO LEARN THE ACTUAL STATE

OF AFFAIRS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THESE TEAMS ARE AUTHORIZED TO

VISIT HAMLETS DIRECTLY WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE DISTRICT CHIEF.

THROUGH THIS MECHANISM, THREE DISTRICT CHIEFS WERE REMOVED: FROM

OFFICE IN PHU YEN PROVINCE FOR ELECTION IRREGULARITIES.F THE CHIEF

OF THIS PROVINCE WAS PLEASED TO INTRODUCE DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES

IN HIS AREA BECAUSE: IT ENABLED. HIM TO ELIMINATE A NUMBER OF CORRUPT

OFFICIALS INSTALLED BY THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION

13. CONCLUSION. FROM THE FOREGOING IT WOULD APPEAR THAT

FREE, DIRECT ELECTION OF OFFICIALS DOES EXIST IN SOME STRATEGIC

AND OTHER HAMLETS, BUT THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IS OFTEN HONORED: E

IN THE BREACH OR APPLIED ONLY IN PART. THE DIRECT ELECTION OF VILLAGE

OFFICIALS IS PRACTICALLY. NONEXISTENT ALTHOUGH THERE IS AN

EXPRESSED INTENTION TO FOLLOW HAMLET SELF-GOVERNMENT WITH VILLAGE

SELF-GOVERNMENT. IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESIDENCY AT LEAST IS

SINCERE IN PROMOTING THE ELECTORAL PROCESS AT THE STRATEGIC

HAMLET LEVEL, ALTHOUGH ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION IS HAMPERED BY A

RURAL POPULATION LARGELY UNPREPARED FOR DEMOCRACY.. IT IS..

BELIEVED THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM RESTS ULTIMATELY ON

THE EFFORTS OF THE CIVIC ACTION CADRES ASSIGNED TO THE

ESTABLISHMENT OF STRATEGIC HAMLETS AND ON THE ABILITY OF PROVINCE

AND DISTRICT CHIEFS TO RECOGNIZE AND ADJUST TO THE NEW ORDER.
