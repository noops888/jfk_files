This agent can testify that on April 28, 1944, subject HERMAN gave the

following signed statement:

"Savannah, Ga.

April 28, 1944

"I, Thomas Harvey Herman, make the following voluntary statement to

Taylor Jo Sims, who has identified himself as a Special Agent of the

F. B. Io

No threats or promises were made to get me to give this and

I know it may be used in court.

"When

I gave Mr. Sims the signed statement about a month ago, I told him

several things that are not the truth.

Actually I was never on the s. So

Mills and have never been in the Merchant Marine. Also I have obtained

money by saying I was in the Navy. I did this six or seven times, and

each time I was with Jack Williams, who was arrested with me here in

Savannah, I really don't know what his real name is. We got $10. to $12.

to $15. each time,

and I know that the people gave us the money because

we had told them we were in the Navy.

This happened in Norfolk, Baltimore,

and a few other places. I have had

the Navy uniform about 9 months and

was wearing it when

I got the money

from these people.

"My mother's name is Glada Herman, and she last resided on 216 California

Ave., Atlantic City, N. Jo My brother Gilbert Herman is in the Navyo

I am 17 yrse old.

"When I was first questioned by Mr. Sims around the last of March this

year, I told him that my name was Jack Dale Williams, but this is not

true and my real name is John Jack Grossi. I did this becuase I didn't

like the name and because I didn't want my mother to know about my trouble.

I also told Mi. Sins before that I had no criminal record, but this also

is not true because I was arrested and placed in New Jersey State Home for

Boys at Jamesburg, No J. I was arrested in Pennsylvania, the town of

Media.

I was arrested for running away from home.

"I also stated in my first statement that my home was in Florida, but

this is not true. My home is 268 17th Ave., Patterson, N. Jo where my

mother, Mrs. Rose Grossi, Lives.

Corps,

My brother, albert, is in army Air

and my sister, Jean Engold, lives with my mother. I told sims

before that I had no brother or sister, and made up the first name 1 gave

for ny mother. My father, John Grossi,

is in the Army. Also I have never

been on the S. S. Mills as I first said.

"As I said before I have not registered for the draft although I am 18

years old.

"About six times during past year I have told people I was in the Navy and

by means of such statement I have asked and received from them various

sums of money ranging from $10, to $18. each time. Usually this happened

while Thomas Harvey Herman and I were hitchhiking. The first time was

coming out of Philadelphia, and other times in Baltimore, Raleigh, No Co,

Washington, D. Co, and Norfolk, Va. Of course neither Herman or I have

ever been in the Navy. At these times we were wearing the uniforms we were

wearing when first picked up here in savannah. It was not true, as I first

said, that I just bought the uniform a month ago. I have had it about 8 or

9 months. I can't remember any of the people who gave us the money, but

I do know that they gave me the money because I said I was in the Navy and

because I had the uniform on. Herman was also wearing his uniforn during

that time, and he has never been a Merchant seaman. I don't remember getting

any money by this means in Savannah..

"I have read the above statement of nearly 2 pages and it is true to the

best of my knowledge. I would also like to say at this time, that any

mercy shown by the court will be very deeply appreciated. If released, I

hope to return to N. Jo and try me best to enter in the armed forces

imnediately.

Special Agent SIMS can also testify that on May 8, 1944 he interviewed

subject GROSSI at the Chatham County Jail, Savannah, Georgia, and that

at such time subject GROSSI was again given an opportunity to tell the

truth concerning his age. Subject GROSSI stated that he fully realized

that he would not be guilty of a violation of the Selective Training and

Service Act of 1940 if he was not 18 years old. He stated that it would

certainly be his desire to state that he was born in 1927 in order to

avoid such prosecution but he again stated that he was born July 5, 1925 at

Patterson, New Jersey and that he had never registered under the Selective

Training and Service Act. At such time he was questioned carefully about

whether he was a parolee or an escapee from the New Jersey State Home

for Boys at Jamesburg, New Jersey®

He stated that he was only a parolee

and he had never escaped from such home.

Special Agent SIMS can also testify that on May 8, 19hl, he interviewed

subject HERVAN at the Chathan lounty Jail, Savannah, Georgia, at which

time he admitted that several facts he had previously given were not

true; namely, that he was living at the Young Hotel, Tennessee Avenue,

Atlantic City, when he met subject GROSSI and that he had previously run

away from home because his mother, MRS. GLADA MAE HERMAN, 216 California

Avenue, Atlantic City, had made him stay home.

He stated that she was not

dead as he had first told the agent.

He stated that he had later gone

back and tried to locate his mother but that she had moved from such

and he did not know where she was located at the present time.

WILLIAM CO

LASSITER,

Ito

a vanany Georgia-

Naval Reserve

It. LASSITER who had originally questioned the two subjects on the day

they were apprehended by military police authorities was interviewed by

the writer concerning the unifom that subject GROSSI was wearing at the

time of his apprehension. Lt. LASSITER advised that it was his opinion

that the uniform itself was a Merchant Marine uniform and not one of the

T. S. Navyo He stated that since GROSSI was not wearing any Navy insignia

that such uniform, although it appeared very similar to a regular Navy

uniform, would not be classed by the Navy as such. He stated that he could

not say as to whether the two red service stripes which GROSSI had on one

of the sleeves of the uniform which he was wearing were Navy stripes although

it was his opinion that ordinary Merchant Seamen do not wear such service

stripes.

He stated that the main distinguishing feature between the uniform

of the two subjects was that the Navy uniform which HERMAN was wearing con

tained three small stripes around the collar which definitely designated

it as a Navy uniform, and that GROSSI'S uniforn did not have such three small

stripes:

PROSECUTIVE ACTION

The facts concerning the uniform worn by subject GRUSSI as related by It.

WILLIAM C. LASSITER, U. S, Naval Reserve, were discussed with Assistant

U. So Attorney JULIAN HARTRIDGE, Savannah, Georgia, who advised that it

was his opinion also that the uniform which subject GROSSI was wearing

was not the uniform of the U.S. Navy and that he was dismissing the charges

which had been brought against the subject GROSSI for Illegal Wearing of

the Uniform. He stated that the Selective Service charge would be continued

against him, however.

On May 8, 19444, Mr. HARTRIDGE advised he had received inforation from the

GrossI is only 1o years of age and that accordingly there was no violation

part of the subject and that he was dismissing such charges. He stated

that the subject would be held for the New Jersey State Home for Boys and

that GRUSSI would be returned to the custody of such institution.

MR. EDWIN C. HARDISON, U. S. Probation Officer, Savannah, Georgia, advised

the writer that he had received information from the probation officials

to the effect that GROSSI is actually only 16 years old and that he

served some time for juvenile delinquency at the New Jersey State Home

for Boys at Jamesburg, New Jersey.

Mro SCOTT A. EDWARDS, clerk, U. S. District Court, Savannah, Georgia,

presented court records on THOMAS HARVEY HERMAN which reflected that a

criminal information was filed by the U. S. Attomey on one count for

violation of the juvenile delinquency act in that HErMaN did unlawfully,

wilfuly and knowingly wear the duly prescribed uniform of an enlisted man

of the U.S. Navy. On May 11, 1944 he entered a plea of guilty to such

charge and was given two years probation with the exception that he would

be discharged from probation on and after his entry in military service

of the United States for the period of such service.

By teletype dated May 2, 1944, Washington Field Division advised that a

check of the records in

the Navy Department failed to reflect any Navy

enlisted personnel record issued for either of the subjects but it was

stated that one GILBERT ARTHUR HERMAN, born November 24, 1922, Cuba, home

address 342 Taft Sto, Bristol, Pa., serving aboard the USS Thomas Jefferson,

might be HERMAN'S brother®
