On 23 September 1963, a source who is an official in anti-Castro
organizations who 4% considered reliablt, but who docs not
normally report on intelligence matters, advised a repeesentative
of this Agency that he had received a letter from @ friend in
Cuba which stated the following information:

Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez who was sent to
Mexico by the Cuban government as a Commercial Advisor
of Cuba in Mexico, is a member of G-2 and was sent
to Mexico to try to infiltrate counterrevolutionary

groups, :

A foirly reliable source stated that]
uillermo RUIZ of

the Commerical Office .- who has recently been emerging as a
fanatical Fidelista- spoke out about the recent accord
between Cuba and the USSR, saying that it was convenient for
the USSR to keep on the good side of Cuba and thus keep a
dagger in the back of the imperialists. Ambassador HERNANDEZ
Armas, somewhat taken aback by RUIZ" language, pointed out
that the relationship between the USSR and Cuba is based, above
all, on the highest principles of international friendship.
Source further added that RUIZ has been showing himself to

be quite aggressive, politically, in staff meetings and
appears to be a violent partisan-of the Cxstro-regime.

An untested source, in a report dated 27 January 1964, stated
that he-had heard that Guillermo RUIZ had arrived in Mexico
City, that he wae-serving in the Cuban Embassy there in a
diplomatic status, and that he was probably G-2. Source, who -
knew RUIZ in Cuba, described RUIZ as having been born about
1939, being about five feet four inches tall, 135 pognds,

and having red hair. According to source, RUIZ was hnti-
Communist in 1960.
