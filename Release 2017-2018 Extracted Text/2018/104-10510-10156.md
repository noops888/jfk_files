Referenco: UFGA-25261, paragraph 11 (3 June 1966) :4.s20-4s-/a

1. The vocational rehabilitation phase of the ANBUD medical
program ended on 30 June 1966 with the completion of courses by the
remaining trainees, The activity, established in April 1964 by
Tietoement with the Florida State Division of Vocational Rehabilt—

turned to employment. Twenty-three were dropped during evaluation
or training for many reasons including lack of interest, excessive
absenteeism, inability to learn, emotional instability, severity of
handicap, relocation, or confinement in an institution, However,
some of the marginal cases in this group were given partial training
and/or a routine of work which resulted in acquiring sufficient
motivation to solve their own work problems,

3. A list of the participants, courses attended, date and
reason dropped, or date course completed is attached, It should
be noted that most of the trainees also benefited from pre-vocational
training English language instruction which made them more attractive;

4. The apparent success of the vocational rehabilitation
activity could be largely attributed to the supervisor, Mr. Gordon
