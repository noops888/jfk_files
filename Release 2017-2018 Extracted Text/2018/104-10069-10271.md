City

.. On 9 February 1965, AMMUG/1 identified a

photograph of Luisa RODRIGUEZ Calderon, who he stated

had been connected with the DGI (Directorio General de

Inteligencia) and the former Secretary of the Young Com-

munists in the Cuban Ministry of Exterior Commerce.

According to AMMUG/1, the Cuban Government thought

RODRIGUEZ had been recruited by the United States

Government while in Mexico so she was recalled to Cuba.

AMMUG/1 was not sure of the details but recalled something

concerning her having received a letter from an American.

Further, AMMUG/1 recalled something about an American

student who visited Cuba who was supposed to have made a

recruitment pitch to RODRIGUEZ or been associated in some

manner with a pitch made to her.

AMMUG/1 did not know

the source of these alleged pitches.

This photograph is part of the surveillance of the

Cuban Consulate in Mexico City and was taken from Film
