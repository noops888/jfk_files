ALEX: I'll talk te him and have him go to JOE and
let JOE send him im. Or, I could send him
to the lawyer, but I’m just trying to
avoid that question if it came up.

HUMPHREYS: I don't think it will, but it's good.

ALEX: We got to get another witness.

. HUMPHREYS: Another ome! We got to got a lot of them!
ALEX: And we got to got them before they get them.
HUMPHREYS: Yeah. You know who we could get to be a

witness? He'd be a hell of a witness.
ALEX: Who?

HUMPHREYS; CLAIR.

The reference of ALEX to MONAGHAN is probably a
reference to ROBERT F.. MONAGHAN, an Assistant United States

Attorney in Chicago. The reference to CLINTON :

is a reference to STANFORD. CLINTON, who is an attormey in Chicago
and who is ome of the attorneys representing ANTHONY ACCARDO in
his pending trial. It is obvious that the conversation—concerns
the trial of ACCARDO, who has been indicted for fraudulently
charging expenses for the use of his automobile which h@ claims
he used to sell "Foxhead Fourhundred” beer for the Premium

Beer Sales, Incorporated. It is apparemt that ALEX amd —
HUMPHREYS are concerned with finding witnesses who will back

up ACCARDO's claim that he used the car during the course -

of selling "Foxhead Fourbundred.”

The Yorkshire referred to ts believed to be the
Yorkshire Room Restaurant lecated at 2842 North Sheridan Road
in Chicage. :

The reference to STEVE by ALEX midway in the conversatio:
is probably a reference to STEVE DE KOSTA. It is noted :
that DE KOSTA is ostensibly the ower and manager of the Huckster's
Restaurant in Chicago. According to PCI TURA SATANA, a
burlesque dancer, who is intimately friendly with HENRY SUSK
and also well acquainted with GUS ALEX, the Huckster’s.is operated
