HUMPHREYS:

The reference of Ally to

MONAGHAN Is probably a

reference to robErT f MONaGhAn, an Assistant United States

The reference

to CLINTON

1s a reference to STANFORD CLINTON, "hO 1S

an sttorney in Chicago,

who is one of the attorneys representing ANTHONY ACCARDO 1n

his pendiug trial.

It is obvious that the

conversation concerns

the trial of ACcarDo, who has been indicted for Irandulently

charging expenses for the use of his

autonobile which he claims

he used to sell "Foxhead Fourhundred" beer for the Premium

Beer sades, Incorporated.

It is apparent that ALEX and

HUMPHREYS are concerned with

finding witnesses

who wadl back

up ACCArDO's claim that he used the car during the course

of selling "Foxhead Fourhundred."

The Yorkshire referred

to is belioved to be the

Yorkshire RoI Restaurant located at

284 North Sheridan Road

in Chicago.

The reference to stilE by AlX midway in the conversation

1s probably & reference to

STEVE DE KOSTA.

It is noted

that dE KoStA is ostensibly the omer and

manager of the Huckster's
