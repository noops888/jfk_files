Sources in Ishombe's offce are close mouthed regarding report

originating that Tshombe plans leave this week. to mee U Thant

in Europe or New York. CAS has report that as of late July 9

Tshombe planned leave on or immediately after July 11

Independence cermonies. Tshombe is quoted as saying Brigadier

Rikhye extended Invitation on behalf U Thant.

Rikhye gave me opposite impression, 1.e. Thant unlikely receive

Tshombe at this stage..

One observer believes that Tshombe

may be using this gimmick as cover for trip to Europe to lo0k

discreetly into Du Farron's reported betrayal which if known

could compromise Tshombe seriously (Brussels telegram 34 to

â€¢ Department)
