COMMENTS

1. Classified SECRET this document presents no prob-
lem in a technical sense. (U)

2. Released in an unclassified format, the report
would identify in extremely fine detail the workings of the
Mexico City Station at the time of Lee H. Oswald's visit
to Mexico City. Names of staffers and contract agents, 24
cryptonyms, safe site locations, Giaison with the Mexicans
and uni latergljoperations against the Soviet target are
discussed. (he ‘report reveals a large political action ou
program in Mexico at that time.) (S)

3. The report is suspicious of CIA in tone and
implies that CIA even today is concealing evidence, for
example, Oswald's photograph. (U)
