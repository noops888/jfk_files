S)

Metorandum of Conversation, Dan
€ <SeRather/Les Midgley and the DCI,
Xe S*"pated 6 September 1975

1. The referent memorandum contains two points
which require comments. The first point concerns
allegations that were made shortly after the assassination
of President Kennedy and that-flave crept up every so often
since then. In one form or gnotRer, the allegations are
that’ Lee Harvey OSWALD ha connected with the Agency.
The allegations are tore

wtfounded.

2. The facts regérding 2 es are as follows:

a. Gyembéev 2983 I was instructed by
” Mr. R.G. as ea ay neee te superior at that time, to

make a tho: thin the Agency at Headquarters
to determin e Harvey OSWALD had ever been
used by the Agenc\\or been connected with it in any
conceivable way. ordered me to make the checks
directly and personally to the degree possible and not
to accept statements of intermediaries. He also ex-
plained that he was following instructions from-Mr. R.
Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the
Agency's key contact officials with the Warrén
Commission. a

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index
of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I
rechecked the Main Index and found no’record beyond
that which I had already obtainedbefore (plus. those
items which had been integrated {nto the records system
since the assassination). There was nothing in the DDO
records which indicated any Agency connection with
OSWALD.

c. The nj component I checked was DCD.
There was no ecord in their Headquarters files.
Arrangements: were then made for me to check

chiefs ofthe bagésthen serached their records .
and spoke‘ wi neheir officers. I was then advised
by e@ch o£ thes efs or their designees individ—

and LA Division's Cuban Operations Group (COG) for
any informal desk records. The results were like-
wise negative.

j. Finally, I also checked therecords: of: the

negative results.

of their wiate stations, I was told, and the

4, I recall very clearly that we were extremely
concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American: returning
from the USSR, might have been routinely ‘debriefed by
Deb, thus having established contact with the Agency.

The same point has now, quite understandably, been made

by the two CBS newsmen. Having some knowledge of this
subject I have personally concluded that there is valid
reason for DCD's lack of interest in OSWALD at that time. |
He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD
had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before |
1957/1958. Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners, j
particularly by Americans, before that time was quite |
uncommon and we were hungry for eyewitness information in i
those days. The thaw began in about 1956 and by the end
of that decade @ were so many persons travelling to
and from the SoytetSUnion that DCD was incapable of talk-
ing to all of fhem? Therefore, a program of selectivity

and pect tigceanset Gane was instituted. In

light of th& seems to me that OSWALD-- if he
fn at all--would have easily been i
simply did not possess the type of
was seeking at that time. DCD would 1
ts limited manpower on travellers who
ha ee access in the USSR.

eS hould be added that my above-described
search in She Agency file holding produced no record or i
indication that any other US Government agency had used |
him as a source or had considered him for recruitment. H

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN DCI AND J, EDGAR HOOVER
26 November 1963 - 11:20 a.m. .

DC: I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency
is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection
with your investigation of the situationin Dallas. I know
the importance the President places on this investigation
you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was
giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just
wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

H We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you,
DCL: Good, Well you can call on us for anything we have.
EH: We will feel free to do that
DCI: I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report
and I am delighted that the President has called on you to i
make it.
H: We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man
was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question
that he is the right man, There are a lot of aspects that we have
dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter ir Mexico City.
We have now found that the: photograph that was ta ten was not

that of Oswald. We do find from our informant down there that
Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has -
given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit
to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it wold take three
weeks. He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or
ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

DCL: Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have
those operational sources down there. We want to handle them
very carefully. It involves some very high level people down
there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

Me. Wwho is handling it for the Department - |
it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

SECRET of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report
that will be released to the public, probably through the White

House, but it is the intention after it is in final form to be
checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned
in it, State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of
the passport to the man to come back to this country and that \|
has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc.
all of which of course we are gathering. The aspects of the .
Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned. It is his
intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be
sure that whatever is said in the report is conférred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned. So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said i
and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

Dat: Well that will be fine. Thank you

2. The DDP wishes to have from SS a8 wg
comprehensive memorandum which highlights the baslt issues or
positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the
Commission. For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission
would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements
might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they
will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-
spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates
that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous
interviews. I raged with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent
information watdees are processing which originated with the
sensitive WHsource. I informed him that in your t Mew this would

‘In recruituent of Cubans, an effort is made to find those knowing the fewest

When he has completed his training and is sent abroad, the DGI covers the ex-

On 17 December Mr. mei < edvised that the Bureau was
anticipating a request from the Wgmiiission, named by President
Johnson to look into this case, for copies of Bureau materials
supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-
vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by
‘the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with the/Sylvia DURAN
aspect in which it would appear rather clear that some United States
Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich
inquired as to whether information in this report might be given
to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some
other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.
‘The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-
vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others
in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed
to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of .
' the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this
manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to
telephone taps.

We brought up the question of Gutierrez and received

previously earned from the FBI, though somewhat attenuated
because, as Scott and White pointed out, the FBI was carrying
the primary responsibility with Gutierrez. We suggested that

Gutierrez’ story might be confirmed or refuted by photographs
taken by the CIA, that in particular the automobile he claimed
to have seen might show up on the fringes of some of these

photographs, and we inquired whether an eppropriate examina-
tion of the picture reels had been made, White replied that ~ H
such an examination had not yet been made and that he j

Oswald was in Mexico City, using as a key the fact that
Oswald's attempt to obtain a visa was probably communicated to

The hotels aear this particular bus terminal are almost all

grouped around the same areca as the Hotel del Comercio, and

it would seem very possible that Oswald could have been

realized that any REPRODUCTION afternoon could

made at the higher eche: Pai re ssp esy and the Commission.

Slawson put out the suggestion that the Commission might

publish a narrative containing all the detail obtainable from
Silvia Duran's statements and from the "open" investigations
carried on by FBI agents and Mexican police agents throughout

. Mexico, supplemented to some extent by the information obtained
through the CIA's wire-tapping activities and the CIA's

: informants. This supplement, however, would not be in detail;

rather, for example, it would use phrases like "in the after-

noon" in place of "4:05 p.m." Also, no absulute quotes would
' be used. Only the substance of conversations would be given.

The sources for this narrative would be stated to be Silvia

Duran's interrogation, the "open" investigations and "other

confidential sources considered reliable by the Commission and
the federal iotennteen yed." Mr. Scott's reply - |
to this suggestion was REPRE oN. be acceptable i

fact known so widely that virtually anyone who stays at this

law-enforcement and diplomatic circles? Is it likely that the
clerk at this hotel is a Cuban agent and is holding back
information on Oswald, since he has stated that he has no

1. One of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate other
than his first was in the afternoon. See paragraph 11 of the
first police interrogation.

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban

“Consulate at least twice and probably three times.

This seems so because:

a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the
Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or
Wednesday.

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban
Consulate at least once on Friday and at least once on

Saturday, see CIA memorandum, pages 6 through 8.

c. We ~ Bee he visited the Cuban Consulate on

Friday and that he diWCinmy kone to the Russian

Consulate that same d PRO Srey page 7.

d. Oswald was supposed to be in the Cuban Embassy

at least once during the morning, see the second police inter-

paragraph 11.

e. Oswald's argument with Azque was in the after-
noon, and it was on some visit to the Cuban Consulate which
. occurred after the first visit, see the second police inter-
rogation, paragraph 11. This afternoon visit during which
the argument with Azque took place was itself different from
and earlier than the visit to the Cuban Consulate during which
Silvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get
a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip
of paper with her name and telephone number; because Azque
telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,
see paragraph 4 of this memorandum, and Oswald was given
Duran's slip of paper subsequent to this phone call, when he

"returned" to the » REPROPOE TION rst police interroga-

SUBISCT: . Letter to the Centra. ence Agency (CIA)

+ Posing Certain Guestions’ on their Letter to Us.
dated 31 January 1964

I would include in our letter to che CIA the following
: questions:

1. Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged

meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was

. supposed to have taken Urrpeds in an automobile outside the
‘+ @uban Enbassy in Mexico city? -"

2. Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet
Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? If you
do, can we find out its contents?

- 3. Reference 1s made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your
letter. Would it be possible for us to see the full report
- of the Mexican police interrogations of. irs. Duran and her |
husbarid?.- oO 3

4. Paragraph 7 of your letter states that Oswald,
"that same afternoon," came back "again" to the Cuban
Embassy. Does this mean that he was there twice the same
day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous
day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the
Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this
sentence seems consistent with the ClA-confirmed information
found in the subsequent paragraphs. In general, we would

appreciate as much on as you can give us on the
time sequence of the jaragraph 7. Of
course, if you are 4 the full text of
the Mexican police sie eae 8a. ie can try to piece
out the time sequence PROG iB E : i
5. Reference 1s ma il D 7, in which i
> +,'., Mes. Duran. refers to " "descriptive data" on Oswald which she _

found in the Consulate "arctiives." “The use of these terms
seems to leave open the possibility that the Cuban Embassy

6. Reference is made to ¢ E sentence in the 2nd
subparagraph of paragraph 12b. Is there any significance
to the word, "Although"? We wonder whether the informant
meant to say that there was something unusual in Mrs. Duran
reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued
to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

7. Refermce is again made. to the 2nd subparagraph of
paragraph 12b. Your letter states that Mrs. Duran told the
Soviet Embassy” that Oswald"knew no one in Cuba} and that
the Soviet official “echoed her statement that the American
was not known." It 1s unclear to us whether this discuasion
. Anvolved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Soviet
- Officials, or whether it involved Oswald's not knowing |
anyone in the Soviet and/or Cuban Embassies. .

8. Reference is made to paragraph 12c. Was the “direct |
conversation" between one of the members of the Soviet
Embassy and Oswald a telephone call from Oswald while he was .t
at the Cuban Embassy, or did the informant mean to say that

9. Reference is again made to paragraph 12c. Could i
you clarify the many references to the "address" referred to
so frequently in this paragraph? 7

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Foreign Intelligence
SUBJECT: QuWIN

1. Confirming our conversation of 26 June 1963, I make
the following recommendations concerning the further handling
and possible disposition of QJWIN:

a. I believe the original purpose for which
JSWIN was continued and sent to is ae under-

Q

cover acsignnentp) ea) ient validity
to justify the Oe BO) yond the
termination of Es ‘3 present contract for this purpose

alone. P A D
b. QUWIN, i RO BIE competent, usable

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles
in Europe where we have very few assets. Whether this
is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends
on the man Station, 9 of how he can be used either by *
the German Station.or by the Austrian Station or by
any other KUBARK as a long term unofficial
cover agent. He is not being used at the present time.
He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any
operational assignments are concerned.

c. It is recommended that the present Chief of
Station Luxembourg and RABNEY be consulted by
Headquarters for their best recommendations as to
the continued use of QUWIN. After these recommendations
are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian
stations be consulted for their possible interest in
using him. If after these discussions a sensible
framework for the operational use of QJWIN can be
established, I would recommend we continue him. If
not, I would recommend that he be terminated at the
time his present contract expires.

2. As far as the ZRRIFLE aspects of this operation
which have been covered under the QJWIN authorization for
security reasons and with which Fletcher M. KNIGHT is fully
familiar as I orally advised you on 26 June 1963, except for

one precautionary "life line", aspects of this case have 4

been terminated and Pree perhaps for minor

1, It makes little PROHIBITED neo had at one tine an

OI interest in Oswald. As soon as I had heard Oswale's name, I recalled
that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -- sometime in Summer 1960 --
with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the layang
on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable channels, At the
moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family
were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

2, I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck >
me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I
told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get
the information we need, because this individual looks odd." We were
particularly interested in the OI Oswald might provide on th¢ Minsk
factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city
itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop
target personality dossiers. u

3. I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at
the time, Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's ariival.
I do not know what action developed thereafter,

4. As an afterthought, I recall also that at the time I was becoming
increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered
in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet 4
women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually ~
divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning “home”,
The AEOCEAN 3 case. was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases, We established links between

some of these women and the KGB. KUDESK became interested in the developing
trend we had come across. It was partly out of curiosity to learn if
Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of
interest in Oswald's own expe: d in the U SSR, that we showed operational
intelligence interest in thectarveS story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Repart conveys an impression of
limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission
inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts
of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and
submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted
to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)
and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation
is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,
to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that ~
effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

£.1 Dissemination to the Intelligence Community
E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren commission

£.3  Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4 Memoranda to Warren Commission

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Since CI Staff released al] long-form CSCI's, coordinated
