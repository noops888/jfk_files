Re:

Request Pertaining

Surveillance

NOTE:

Two of the 17 subjects of viretaps have entered

suits against the Government seeking damages in connection

with the electronic surveillances. The remaining 15

individuals of the surveillances are not plaintiffs;

however, the Government has not specifically acknowledged

these individuals to have been the subjects of electronic

surveillances.

Departmental Attorney Laward Christenbury

advised on 6/6/75 that the Department as of that time had

not made a final determination as to whether the electronic

surveillance material requested by the SSC concerning the

two plaintiffs (specifically Morton H. Falperin and

•William Anthony Lake) would be furnished to the Committee.

The authorizations on all of the wiretaps, however, are

being furnished to the Department of Justice, which will

make the legal determination as to whether the information

will be turned over to the SSC. The memorandum has "fa

Secret" material attached.

The phrases "nith British Intelligence," and

"that British Intelligence" were excised on lines 10 and 11(5)

respectively of paragraph three of enclosure dated May 29,

1969, which approved placing the telephone surveillance on

Henry Brandon. Lie excision was made to protect British

Intelligence](s)

This matter has been coordinated with Special

Agents Robert F. Peterson and Robert F. Olmert of the Legal

NOTE:

The Attorney General's letter dated 6/24/75 traces

the legal authority to utilize warrantless electronic

surveillances; the Attorney General's 5/12/75 letter traces

the legal authority for consensual electronic surveillances.

The 6/24/75 letter has been released to the press by the

Attorney General.

On 7/3/75 Mr. Douglas Marvin, Special

Senator toned, i tot say tate tzone, on that de nay

INID, that the Attorney General's

well appear in some future transcript of Congressional

hearings.

The Committee requested data regarding the legal

authority for "all forms of electronic surveillance and

consensual electronic surveillance" in Appendix A, item sa.

The enclosed material covers warrantless electronic surveillances

and consensual electronic surveillances.

It does not appear

necessary to point out the legal basis for warranted electronic

surveillances in Title III of Public Law 70-351.

Appendix B, items 4a and b requested data indicating

the original decision to utilize these techniques and data

indicating the policies and procedures of the TBI for the

utilization of these techniques.

The policies and procedures

of the FBI for utilization of these techniques are those

required by the Attorney General which are set out in the

enclosed material. The fact that the FBI utilizes electronic

surveillances, with andwithout consent, is public knowledge

and it does not appear necessary to point this out.

ALLF

DATELE

Dear Senator Kennedy:

In response to your letter of April 24, 1975, I am

presently able to provide you with most of the intormation

you have requested concerning the electronic surveillance

activities of federal departments and agencies.

The in-

formation contained in this letter and the enclosed material

relates mainly to electronic surveillance conducted within

the United States pursuant to the criminal law enforcement

responsibilities of the federal government. It does not

include electronic surveillance that may be conducted either

in the interests of national security, or outside the United

States by federal departments and agencies other than the

Department of Justice.

As to these latter areas, the De

partment is still in the process of assembling and review-

ing the materials relevant to your request, and we are thus

unable at this time to determine what information we may be

able to provide. I should note that in several instances

your letter requests information that is either not in the

possession of this Department or pertains to areas outside

its proper jurisdiction. Since I understand that you have

sent similar letters to other federal departments and agen-

cies, I expect that you will receive responses from them.

Nevertheless, I believe the information contained in this

letter and the enclosed material will answer in substantial

part the questions you have raised concerning electronic

surveillance..

Apart from the area of national security, electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States by federal

departments and agencies may be divided into two broad

categories: consensual and non-consensual.

Consensual

electronic surveillance refers to those instances in which

one, ox more parties to the communication is a federal agent,

is cooperating with a federal agent, or has consented to

the surveillance. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held

that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does

not apply to consensual surveillance. See, e.g., United

States v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971) ; Lopez V. White, 373

U.S. 427 (1963); Rathbun v. United States, 355 U.S. 107

(1957); On Lee V. United States, 343 U.S. 747 (1952) :

Con-

gress has also excepted consensual electronic surveillance

from the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Con-

trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968, including the requirement

of a court order.

Thus, "sections 2511(a) (c) and (a) of Title

28 of the United

States Code provide:

(c) It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person acting under color of law

to intercept a wire or oral communication, where

such person is a party. to the communication or

one of the parties to the communication has given

prior consent to such interception.

(2) It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person not acting under color of

law to intercept a wire or oral communication

where such person is a party to the communication

or where one of the parties to the communication

has given prior consent to such interception un

less such communication is intercepted for the

purpose of committing any criminal or tortious

act in violation of the constitution or laws of

the United States or of any State or for the pur-

pose of committing any other injurious act.

Although consensual electronic surveillance may thus

be conducted without a court order, its use by federal agents

since 1967.

Re: Monitoring Private Conversations with the Consent of

a Party," and in a subsequent amending order issued by

Attorney General Saxbe. Copies of the memorandum and order

axe enclosed herein.

In general, all federal agencies and departments

are required to obtain advance authorization from either

the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal

Division, or Deputy Assistant Attorney General of that

Division before any electronic device may be used to over-

hear, transmit, or record a private conversation, other than

a telephone conversation, without the consent of

all the

parties to that conversation. In exigent circumstances

precluding a prior request for authorization - such as

imminent loss of essential evidence or a threat to the

immediate safety of an agent or informant - emergency

monitoring may be instituted with the authorization of the

head of

the responsible department or agency or his designee:

The Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, how-

ever, must be notified promptly of any such monitoring

and

of the specific conditions that precluded obtaining prior

approval.

The above procedures do not apply to consensual moni-

• toring of telephone conversations.

Because they involve the

transmission of a participant's voice through a complex and

far-reaching network of wires, the common use of party lines

and extension telephones, and

I the possibility of an unseen

participant permitting another person to listen on the same

extension, telephone conversations have long been thought

not to enjoy the same expectation of privacy as face-to-face.

conversations.

For this reason, supervision and control over

consensual monitoring of telephone conversations are vested

instead in the head of each federal department and agency,

who is required

1 to adopt appropriate regulations and pro-

cedures on the subject.

These regulations usually do not

restrict consensual monitoring of telephone conversations

any significant respect. The relevant regulations of the

Drug Enforcement Administration are enclosed herein.

The current regulations issued by the Attorney

General also require the head of

each federal department

and, agency to exercise responsibility for the security of

all consensual monitoring devices, including the maintenance

of current inventories as to amounts, storage, and users of

such equipment, and to submit to the Attorney General dur-

ing July of each year a report containing an inventory of

all electronic and mechanical equipment designed for the

monitoring of conversations and a brief statement of the

results obtained from their use during the prior fiscal year.

All federal departments and agencies having criminal

investigative responsibilities are authorized

to conduct con

sensual

electronic surveillance.

These agencies include,

inter-alia, the Bureau of Alcohol; Tobacco and Firearms, the

Bureau of Customs, the Department

of Agriculture, the Internal

Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the

Drug Enforcement Administration, the Postal Service,

the

Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Naval Investi-

gative Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,

and the Department of Interior.

The number of consensual

uses of

electronic surveillance devices authorized by the

Department of Justice between 1970 and 1974 is set forth in

the attached memoranda.

The total annual authorizations

were

as follows: 1970, 512; 1971, 840; 1972, 1272; 1973, 1484;

1974, 2518.

In the first quarter of 1975, the total number

of authorizations was 1,125. In March 1975, the total author-

ized was 461.

The above

figures, of course, do not include

consensual monitoring of telephone conversations. Nor do

they include consensual electronic surveillance that may be

conducted either outside the United States or in the inter-

ests of national security.

Apart from the area of national security and foreign

intelligence, non-consensual electronic

the United States is conducted pursuant surveillance within

to a court order.

Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

Act of 1968, the Attorney General may authorize an applica-

• tion to a federal judge of a competent jurisdiction, who may

grant an order approving the interception of wire or oral

communications "by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

ox a Federal agency having responsibility for the investi-

gation of the offense as to which the application is made,"

when such interception may provide or has provided evidence

of cextain specific offenses enumerated in section 2516 of

Title 18 of the United States Code.

The agencies having

investigative responsibilities under section 2516, and

hence®

authority to conduct non-consenstal electronic sur-

veillance, are the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bur

eau of Customs, the Drug Enforcerent Administration, the

Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Postal Service.

The administrative procedures and guidelines govern-

ing electronic surveillance under Title III are contained in

the Manual for Conduct of Electronic Surveillance, a copy of

which is enclosed.

The procedures specified in the Manual

apply to every federal department of agency authorized to

conduct electronic surveillance under Title III: All sur-

veillance authorized under Title III is conducted within the

United States or Puerto Rico; Title III has no application

in foreign countries. See 18 U.S.C. 2516(1) .

• : The extent of electronic surveillance conducted by

the federal government pursuant to Title III between 1971

and 1974 is contained in the reports issued by the Adminis-

trative Office of The United States Courts, as required by

18 U.S.C. 2519(3). Copies of those reports are enclosed

with this letter.

The number of electronic surveillances

authorized under Title III so far in 1975 is 28. The Federal

Bureau of Investigation requested 27 of those surveillances,

including 3 extensions. The Drug Enforcement Administration

requested the remaining 1.

With respect to electronic surveillance conducted

outside the United States, I can provide you with informa-

tion relating only to the

policy and practice of the Depart-

ment of Justice. With the exception of the Drug Enforce-

ment Administration, no division, bureau, or agency of

this Department conducts electronic surveillance outside

the United States for any purpose, including national

security. The Drug Enforcement Administration does con-

duct electronic surveillance outside the United States in

certain limited circumstances.

This surveillance is pres-

ently undertaken only on a bilateral basis, that is, with

the approval and participation of the foreign country in-

volved.

It is my understanding, however, that a predecessor

organization of DEA did conduct non-consensual electronic

surveillance unilaterally in at least one instance occurring

in 1973. The surveillance was initiated in connection with

•that organization's criminal law enforcement responsibilities

and

was designed to obtain information concerning inter-

national drug traffickers.

The subject of the surveillance

was a foreign national, and not an American citizen or an

alien resident of the United States.

Under its current policy, DEA does not conduct

any

non-consensual electronic surveillance abroad without the

approval and participation of the foreign country.

In al-

than by DEA, and is not initiated as the result of a reguest

by DEA. I am informed that the instances in which DEA has

been responsible in any way for electronic surveillance

conducted abroad are exceedingly few, and that in none of

these was the subject of the surveillance an American citizen

or an alien resident of the United States.

Under existing regulations, the approval of the u.s.

Chief of Mission in the host country is required before DEA

may conduct, or request a foreign country to conduct, non-

consensual. electronic

surveillance outside the United States.

In addition, I have ordered that henceforth DEA shall obtain

the prior approval of the Attorney General before conducting,

of requesting anyone else to conduct, non-consensual elec-

tronic surveillance outside the United States where the sub-

ject of the surveillance is an American citizen or alien resi-

dent of the United States. Although the approval of the

Attorney General has not been requixed previously, as indi-

cated above there have apparently been no instances in

which an American citizen or resident has been the subject

of non-consensual electronic surveillance conducted abroad

bY DEA or initiated at its request.

On occasion DEA has also conducted consensual elec-

tronic surveillance outside the United States, usually in- -

volving the use of a voice transmitter concealed on an

informant, a DEA agent, or a law enforcement officer of the

host country. Under DEA's current policy, this transmitter

device is used with the specific approval

and participation

of the foreign country. Again, in almost all cases, the

suiveillance is actuully conducted by a law enforcement

official of the foreign country, rather than by deA, and

DEA's involvement is in general

limited to supplying the

equipment necessary to conduct the

surveillance.

So far as

DEA can determine, no American citizen or alien resident of

the United States

has been the subject of consensual elec-

tronic surveillance conducted abroad through use of this

device by DEA, or by a foreign country at DEA's request.

I have ordered that whenever practicable DEA shall

obtain the advance approval of the Assistant Attorney General

in charge of the Criminal Division, or Deputy Assistant At-

torney General of that Division, before conducting, or re-

questing anyone else to conduct, consensual electronic sur-

veillance outside the United States where the subject of the

surveillance is an American citizen or alien resident of the

United States.

Where circumstances preclude a prior request

fOr

authorization, DEA may conduct the surveillance, but

shall notify promptly the Assistant Attorney General in charge

of the Criminal Division of the surveillance and the specific

conditions that precluded obtaining prior approval. This

procedure parallels that outlined in Attorney General Klein-

dienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 governing consensual

electronic surveillance within the United States by federal

departments and agencies. It. applies, of course, only to

private conversations, other than telephone conversations,

that are sought to be monitored without the consent of

all the parties to that conversation. For the reasons

mentioned earlier, prior approval for consensual monitor-

ing of telephone conversations is not required.

DEA has also used certain electonic devices abroad

in order to track the location of drug shipments.

These

devices ão not transmit, overhear, or record private con-

versations, but rather merely emit signals which indicate

the location of the device.

DEA's policy concerning electronic surveillance

also been descilbeù in iis response io your letter of

April 24 to Mr. Bartels.

The remaining divisions, bureaus,

and agencies within the Department do not conduct electronic

surveillance of any kind outside the United States.

I trust that the information I have furnished will

assist your subcommittee in its inquiry concerning the prac-

tices and procedures of the federal agencies in the area of

electronic surveillance.

The Honorable Edward M. Kennedy

Chairman,

Subcommittee on Administrative

Practice and Procedure

Committee on the Judiciary

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Kennedy:

ALL FEI INFORMATION CONTAINED

EURI BINCLAUSHISS

In my letter to you of May 12, I stated that the De-

partment was in the process of assembling the materials rele-

vant to your inquiry regarding electronic surveillance con-

ducted within the United States in the

interests of national

security and foreign intelligence. Pursuant to a review of

this matter, I am able to provide you with the following in-

formation.

Since 1940 by directives of the President, the Attorney

General has been vested with responsibility over

electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States in the inter-

ests of national security and foreign intelligence. This sur-

veillance is authorized pursuant to the personal approval of

the Attorney General, rather than by court order.

Based

on

• an examination of the relevant precedents, it is the position

of the Department of Justice that the Executive may conduct

electronic surveillance in the interests of national security

and foreign intelligence, and in aid of his conduct of the

nation's foreign affairs, without obtaining a judicial warrant.

This has been the position of the Department of Justice for more

than three decades and is supported by historical practice as

well

as judicial decision.

The only two Courts of Appeals to

address the issue, the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit, have

held that the warrant requixement of the Fourth Amendment does

not apply in the area of national security and foreign intelli-

gence.and. that under. the. Constitution the President has the -

authority to conduct electronic surveillance without a court

order as part of his diplomatic and military or commander-in-

chief functions.

See United States v. Butenko (Appeal of Ivanov),

494 F. 2d 593 (3Id Cir. 1974) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom.

Ivanov v. United States 419 U.S. 881 (1974); United States

v.

Brown, 484 F. 2d 418 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415

U.S. 960 (1974). In Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control

and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress also explicitly dis-

claimed any attempt to place limitations on the President'

authority in this area.

18 U.S.C. §

2511(3).

The Supreme

Court has, of course, expressly left open the question whethex

the warrant requirement applies

to electronic surveillance con-

ducted for national security and foreign intelligence pur-

poses.

In United States v. United States District Court, 407

U.S. 297, 308-9 (1973), however, the Court, while holding that

the domestic security area was

subject to the warrant require

ment, was careful to note that "the instant case requires no

judgment with respect to the activities of foreign powers, with-

in or without this country.

There is no evidence of

involvement, directly or indirectly, of

any

a foreign power."

More-

over, in the Butenko case, although

the United States prevailed

in the Third Circuit, the Department acquiesced in the petition

Fox certiorari. Nevertheless,

the Court denied certiorarI,

thus leaving undisturbed the Third Circuit's decision upholding

the authority of the Executive to conduct electronic surveil-

lance without-a court order where national prurity and foreign

intelligence is involved.

Under the standards and

procedures established by the

President, the personal approval of the Attorney General is re-

quired before any non-consensual electronic surveillance may

be instituted within the United States without a judicial war-

rant.

A11

requests for surveillance must be made in writing by

the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and must

set forth the relevant factual circumstances that justify the

proposed surveillance.

Both the agency and the Presidential

appointee initiating the request must be identified. Requests

from the Director are examined by a special review group which

I have

established within the Office of the Attorney. General.

Authorization will not be granted unless the Attorney General.

has satisfied himself that the requested electronic surveillance

is necessary for national security or foreign intelligence pur-

poses important to national security.

In addition, the Attorney General must be satisfied that

the subject of the

surveillance is either assisting a foreign

N6L 55034 DocId:32989614 Page 50

• 3-.

power or foreign-based political group, or plans unlawful

activity directed against a foreign power or foreign-based

political group.

Finally, he must be satisfied that the

minimum physical intrusion necessary to obtain the informa-

tion will be used.

All authorizations are for a period of ninety days or

less, and the specific approval of the Attorney General is

again required for continuation of the surveillance beyond

that period.

The Attorney General has also been directed to

review all electronic. surveillance on a regular basis to en-

suxe that the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. Pursu-

ant to the mandate of United States v. United States District

Court, electronic surveillance without a judicial warrant is

in age stee pat it

not conducted where there is no foreign involvement.

All electronic surveillance related to national security

and foreign intelligence within the United States is conducted

by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

The Bureau has estab-

lished strict internal review procedures with regard to all

electronic surveillance activities.

The extent of telephone and microphone surveillance

conducted within the United States in the interests of nation-

al security and foreign intelligence was last disclosed in 1973.

On a comparable basis, the extent of such

• surveillance between

1969 aiid May 1975 is

set forth in the attached menoranda. The

total number of subjects of telephone surveillance during that

period is as follows: 1969, 113; 1970, 90; 1971, 87; 1972; 102;

1973, 116; 1974, 148. These figures do not, of course, indicate

the number of persons whose conversations were intercepted,, but

rather only the number of subjects to whom the surveillance

directed.

The total number of subjects of microphone surveillance

• during that period was as follows:

1969, 14; 1970, 19; 1971,16;

1972, 31; 1973, 38; 1974, 32.

Again, these figures do not in-

dicate. the number of persons whose conversations were inter-

cepted, but rather the number of subjects

to whom the sur-

veillance was directed.. Moreover; I should further note that

the above figures are duplicative to an extent since in several

cases the same subject was under both telephone and microphone

surveillance.

The total installations of telephone and microphone sur-

veillances during the above periods would, of course, exceed

period, but was later re-instituted when the subject returned.

In still other cases,

the surveillance was discontinued for a

period

as part of the Department's

continuing review and re-

evaluation of all electronic surveillance activities.

subsequent re-institution of the surveillance pursuant to a

new approval by the Attorney General would be counted as an

additional installation.

For the

above reasons, the number

of installations of telephone and microphone surveillances is

greater than the number of subjects of such surveillance, and

would thus not provide an accurate basis for evaluating

extent of electronic surveillance.

Nevertheless, pursuant to

your inquiry, I.

am including in the attached memoranda the total

number of installations of electronic surveillance devices

for

both telephone and microphones.

I am also enclosing the maxinum and minimmm numher of :::

telephone and microphone surveillances installed and in opera-

tion for each month between November 1972 and April 1975.

These

figures

are based on data compiled on a daily basis and reflect

installations and discontinuances of electronic surveillance de-

vices.

The records of daily counts were initiated in

November

Comparable information is not available for prior periods.

As these figures indicate, the maximum number of telephone sur-

veillances in operation at any time during 1913 was 93; the

minimum number in operation that year was 65. The maximum

number of microphone surveillances in operation during 1973

was 22; the minimum was

10. In 1974, the maximum number of

telephone surveillances in operation was 106; the minimum num-

ber in operation was 75.

Microphone surveillances in operation

during that period ranged from a maximum of 21 to a minimum of

and a half months of 1975, the maxi-

mum number of telephone surveillances in operation at any time

was 91; the minimum was

67. The. maximum number of microphone

surveillances in operation at any time during that period was

20; the minimum was 9. On April 1, 1975, there were 75 tele-

phone and 15 microphone surveillances in operation.

I trust that the information supplied to date is of

assistance to your subcommittee in its inquiry into the prac-

I am also providing

the House Committee on the Judiciary,

and to Senator Church,

Request Pertaining to Identity of All

Mail Covers Placed by the FBI Since 1960

NOTE:

Reference is made to Legal Counsel memoranda to

Mr. J. B. Adams dated 5/23/75 and 6/12/75 which set out the

request upon which this response is predicated.

The statistics

regarding the categories of mail covers noted in this memorandum

were derived by a review of each 3 x 5 card maintained by

the Special Records and Related Research (SRRR) Unit

on requested mail covers.

These cards are maintained

alphabetically by each field office.

They are not broken

down by either type of mail covers or by the categories in

which they are presented in this memorandum.

To obtain the

statistics set out in this memorandum it was necessary to

duplicate all the records, categorize by the three types,

of mail covers and then subdivide the national security

mail covers into general categories.

The data contained on

each card includes; subject, lile number, time period, address,

and brief characterization.

In some instances supervisors

within the INTD who were familar with the subjects were con-

tacted to obtain information necessary to categorize.

As explained in the memorandum, this record was

kept in-house for count purposes only and therefore required

time to reassemble the data in the form presented.

It should be noted this record may not contain

every mail cover utilized by the FBI within the time period

case supervisor and it is possible such notification has been

inadvertantly omited on a particular case.

This qualification

is made to advise as to the limitation of the documents upon

which the memorandum is based.

Preparation of this menorandum was coordinated

with Mr. John Russell, General Investigative, and John McHale,

Special Investigative, as to whether these Division's possess

records beyond those maintained within INTD. It was determined

that they did not.

SENSTUDY 75

By memorandum dated May 23, 1975, you were

advised that captioned Committee had directed a letter

to the U. S. Postal Service requesting information con-

cerning mail covers initiated by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. The Committee was referred by Postal

Service to the Bureau.

Mr. John Elliff, Task Force Director,

was advised to direct a letter over the Chairman's

signature requesting the information.

On May 30, 1975, we recontacted Mr. Elliff again

asking that a letter be directed to the Bureau asking for

the information.

He was instructed that we had been gathering

the requested information, however; prior to our responding,

we should receive a confirmation from the Committee.

Present

at this discussion was K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel

to the Deputy Attorney General. The same information was

conveyed by Special Agent Paul V. Daly to Paul Wallach, Staff

Member of the Committee, who had been making the mail cover

inquiries. Mr. Wallach indicated that he would correspond

to the Bureau in accordance with this request.

K. William O'Connor advised subsequently that the

Department had received a letter from Wallach to the Department

June 7, 1975, containing the request. Mr. O'Connor stated

that this was not in accordance with our discussion with the

Committee and he was to convey the fact that the requess,

should

be over the Chairman's signature.

Memo to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel

SENSTUDY 75

On June 11, 1975, Mike Shaheen of the Department,

who is working with K. William O'Connor in handling responses

to the captioned Committee, informed Special Agent Paul V. Daly

at 5:30 p.M. that we should respond to the request concerning

mail covers without waiting for a letter from the Committee

over

the Chairman's signature.

He advised that this instruction

was received finDeputy Attorney General, Harold R. Tyler.

Tyler distinguished this postal request from others

by stating that inasmuch as the Committee Chairman had

authorized the Committee

• to inquire concerning mail covers

in a letter to U. S. Postal Services, it should not be

necessary for them to write a subsequent letter.

The requests to the Department were conveyed to

the Section Chief of the Intelligence Division, w. O. Cregar,

on June 11, 1975.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare

the necessary responses concerning mail covers.

ALL TRI I, FORMATON GOTAINED:

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

Pursuant to Section III (E) of the notification

attached to the Committee's letter of June 27, 1975, I

hereby request that a complete, unexcised set of the A

• through E

summaries of COINTELPRO cases prepared for the so-callea

Peterson Conmittee be delivered to our offices

no later

than thursday, July 10, 1975.

As stated in the notification, the Comnitiee's

receipt of these summaries will form the basis of further

requests for information and

documents. It is impossible

to use the excised version of the summaries for this

purpose.

Since a thorough analysis of the summaries

requires that the volumes be disassembled, and since

they must be available to staff members working evenings.

and weekends; it is necessary to have the summaries here

at our offices.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

ALL FBI IMORMATION CONTAINED

Dear MI. O'Connor:

The purpose of this letter is to set down in

one place

the present status of the responses

to the

Committee's requests regarding notional organizations.

Your letter of June 12, 1975, transmitted only

one memorandam in response to Appendix C, Part III, Item 24,

of the Committee's May 14, 1975 request.

We would

appreciate

your advice whether any additional matcrials exist which arc

responsive to this portion of our request, and, if so, when

they will be supplied.

With

respect to your July 7, 1975 response to

Appendix C, Part III, Items 25 (a) and (b), we will need to

examine all of the materials which provided the basis for

the preparation of the Bureau's July 2, 1975 summary. In

addition, we will need to examine the materials which were

summarized in Item 2 under the heading "Types of Activity"

in the

• "Exhibit K" attachment to the so-called Peterson

Committee report, which I examined on July 8, 1975.

I would like to assure you that pursuant to your

request, we have seriously considered the Bureau's suggestion

for an oral briefing on this subject. We have concluded,

however, that such a procedure would be helpful only after

we have had the opportunity to study the requested materials

which bear upon this subject.

I might add that in view of

the sensitivity of some of this material, we would certainly

be willing to review at FBI Headquarters whichever of the

10 Li locuments pertain to sensitive ongoing Bureau operations.

At 2:50 p.m. on July 10, 1975, K. William O'Connor

called me and advised that Douglas Marvin, Special Assistant to the

Attorney General, has requested a briefing for the Attorney General

regarding the status of res ponses to inquiries by the Senate Select

Committee. He said that the briefing would be scheduled for the

afternoon of Tuesday, July 15, 1975, if possible. The briefing will

prepare the Attorney General for his appearance before the Senate Select

Committee during the latter part of that week to discuss the status of

responses. It is noted that we have received a written request from the

Committee for the Director and the Attorney General to appear to discuss

this matter in Executive Session.

In anticipation of such a request from the Attorney General,

we have caused a review to be undertaken and a status report prepared

as to all Bureau responses to Senate Select Committee inquiries plus a report

as to items actually delivered to the Committee. The distinction is that

some materials prepared by the Bureau were delivered to the Department.

and have not been forwarded to the Committee.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That the Intelligence Division expedite preparation of the

status report for information of the Director and to prepare for briefin

the Attorney General in the afternoon of July 15, 1975.

The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth in

summary form the requests we have received from various

Committees in Congress and the status of our replies.

Senate Select Committee

On Intelligence Activities (Church's Committee)

By letter dated 5-14-75, we received a lengthy request

from the Committee which pertains to among other things,

information concerning all wiretaps including their reconstruction

of Bureau files, as well as Inspection surveys for ten offices.

During a meeting on May 30, 1975

• of the Committee, and the

Department, this particular requst was modified in

to alleviate possible problems in preparing the responses.

Responses to many of the questions asked have been prepared,

approved, and delivered.

There remains, however, a substantial

amount of work to be done.

Letter dated May 21, 1975, contained a request that

FBI documents in the custody of National Archives concerning

the Warren Commission be made available to the Committee foi

review.

We have furnished a response to this request.

By letter dated May 28, 1975, the Committee requested

that certain Senators on the Select Committee be given access

to any intormation concerning them in FBI files.

This request

Is being handled using the same guidelines as Freedom of Intormation

Act requests and material is being gathered.

The Department

has written a letter to the Committee regarding this requést,

asking that a discussion be held.

On 7/1/75, the SCHAFERS advised that they had

both staff members of the Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence

Activities.

It was a short interview wherein KIRBOW solicited

the general unsworn statements of the SCHAFERS regarding

allegations against the FBI Of JOE BURION. KIRBOW stated that

he believed BURTON was a fool and was probably motivated by

self interest in his allegations.

After hearing the SCHAFERS

general statements contradictory to BURTON's allegations,

KIRBOW said that they confirm his Impression of BuRioN.

SCHAFERS were important to the Committee

s inquiries in

characterizing BURTON

according to KIRBOW. The SCHAFERS

did not go into detail regarding their radical activities

or relationship with the FBI.

KIRBOW said the SCHAFERS' statements would remain

confidential and would not be leaked to the press. KIRBOW

said he did not expect the SCHAFERS to be asked or subpoenaed

to testify openly before the full Committee.

On 6/28/75, captioned individuals again contacted SA Laturno.

They advised that on 6/7/75, they met SENSTUDY staff members

but declined to confer with them regarding their service with the FBI.

They explained they were apprehensive regarding the appearance

and behavior of the staff members, for they looked and acted like a

group of "movement" radicals. On 6/28/75, they met with one

Charles Kirbow, an aide to Senator John G. Tower (R-Texas) who

is Vice Chairman of SENSTUDY, (Congressional Services Office

Tower's Office.). Kirbow, a former CIA Intelligence Officer,

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the fBl or information I may acquire as an employee of the F'Bl could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subiects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.

It is the policy of the Department of Justice to extend the fullest

possible cooperation to congressional committees requesting information from

departmental files, Interviews with department employees, testimony of depart

ment personnel, or testimony of Federal prisoners. The following procedures

re prescribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will b

utually satisfactory to the congressional conmittees and to the Department

(This order supersedes the Deputy Attorney General's Memorandum No. 5, dated

March 23, 1953, and his Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954. It formal-

Izes the Attorney General's press release of November 5, 1953, establishing

procedures to permit comittees of the Congress and their authorized repre-

sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

00 "Authorizetion Under Order lo, 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated

3464, Supplement No. 4 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953 (with Memorandum

followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In

support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter

dated May 17, 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney

General's Memorandun which accompanied 1t.]

A. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM DEPARIMENT FILES

1. Congressional committee requests for the examination of files

or other confidential information should be reduced to writing, signed by

the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney General,

who is responsible for the coordination of our liaison with Congress and

congressional committees. The request shall state the specific information

sought as vell as the specific objective for which it is sought. The Deputy

Attorney General will forward the request to the appropriate division where a

reply will be prepared and returned for the Deputy Attorney General's signa-

ture and dispatch to the chairman of the committee.

2. If the request concerns a closed case, 1. e., one in which

there is no litigation or administrative action pending or contemplated,

the file may be made available for review in the Department, in the presence

of the official or employee having custody thereof. The following procedure

shall be followed in such cases:

a. The reply letter will advise the committee that the

file is available for examination and set forth the

name, telephone extension number, and room number of

the person who will have custody of the file to be

reviewed;

NH 55031 DocId:32989614 Page 122

---

## Page 123

-2-

D. Before making the file available to the committee

representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI

as weld as investigative reports from any other agency,

will be removed from the file and not be made available

for examination; provided however that if the committee

representative states that it is essential that information

from the fBl reports and memoranda be made available,

he will be advised that the request will be considered

by the Department. Thereafter a summary of the contents

of the FBi reports and memoranda involved will be

prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-

niques, the identity of confidential informants, or

other. matters which might jeopardize the investigative

operations of the FBI. This summary will be forwarded

by the division to the fBI with a request for advice as

to whether the ist has any objection to examination of

such summary by the cormittee representative.

The file

will not be physically relinquished from the custody of

the Department. If the committee representative desires

to examine investigative reports from other government

agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he

will be advised to direct his request to the agency whose

reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, 1. e., one which liti-

sation or administrative action 1s pending or contemplated, the file may

not be made available for examination by the committee's representative.

The following procedure shall be followed:

a. The reply letter should advise the committee that

its request concerns a case in which litigation or

administrative action is pending or contemplated, and

state that the file cannot be made available until the

case is completed; and

D. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in

as much detail as is practicable and prudent without

Jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or

administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTURVIEVS WITH DEPARTMENTAL PERSONNEL

I. Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding

any official matters vithin the Department should be reduced to writing,

signed by the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney

General. When the approval of the Deputy Attorney General is given, the

employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with

the representative, subject to the limitations prescribed in A respecting

open cases and data in investigative reports;

HH 55034

DocId: 32989614

## Page 124

- 3 -

2. Upon the completion of the interview with the committee repre-

sentative the employee will prepare a summary of it for the file, with a

copy routed to his division head and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney

General.

C. EMPLOYEES TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

1. When an employee is requested to testify before a congressional

committee regarding official matters within the Department the Deputy Attorney

General shall be promptly informed. When the Deputy Attorney General's approv-

al is given the employee is expected to testify freely subject to limications

prescribed in A respecting open cases and data in investigative reports;

2. An employee subpoenaed to testify before a congressional committee

on ofiicial matters within the Department shall promptly notify the Deputy

Attorney General.

In general he shall be guided in testifying by Order 3229

of this Order.

3. Upon the completion of his testimony the employee will prepare

& memorandum outlining his testimony with a copy routed to his division head

and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney General.

D. REQUESTS OF CONCRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which

their public testimony may alfect the discipline and vell-being of the institu-

tion, it is the policy of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-

side the penal institution in which they are Incarcerated for the purpose of

being interviewed or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,

when it appears that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be

adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise

under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the

Deputy Attorney General.

1.

Arrangements for interviewing and taking of sworn testimony

from a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorize

representatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a writter

request by the chairman of the comittee to the Deputy Attorney General.

Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days

prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony

and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the

Interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-

mittee. Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-

jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogated as well as the names of

all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who

will be present.

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be

present during the entire time of the interrogation.

HH 55034 DooId:32989614 Page 124

## Page 125

=4 -

4: The warden of the penal institution in which the Federal

prisoner is incarcerated shall, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the

time at which the interview takes place, advise the Federal prisoner concerned

of the proposed interview or taking of svorn testimony; and shall further

advise that he is under the same, but no greater obligation to answer than any

other witness who is not a prisoner.

So the warden of the penal institution shall have complete

authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-

nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will be present at

the interview and taking of testimony.

6.

The warden or his authorized representative shall be present

at in are eat en

at the interview and at the taking of testimony and the Department of Justice

i at justice

shall have the right to have one of its representatives present throughout

the interview and taking of testimony.

7. The conmittee shall arrange to have a stenographic transcript

made of the entire proceedings at committee expense and shall furnish a copy

of the transcript to the Department of Justice.

E. OBSERVIRS IN ATTENDANCE AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS

In order that the Department may be kept currently advised in

matters within its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney

General may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with Congress and

its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a

congrssional hearing, will have the observer prepare a written summary of

the proceeding which

should be sent to the division head and a copy routed

to the Deputy Attorney General.

SUBJECT: Access to Exhibits K, L, and P of "Petersen Report"

After review of A-E as excised, Mr. Elliff has asked

If he may now have an opportunity to see and read Items k and l

(semany reports on lonel espionage me meet me seen

tified in iny memo of June 5, 1975; and I believe it will be

followed by a request for personal access to Item P (the overall

FBI recommendation). In view of the AG's disclosures to SSC

(made in classified letters) regarding certain foreign-oriented

Cointelpro activity, I see no reason to deny Mr. Elliff's request

for personal access to K and L; and in view of the recent access

granted to the T. J. Smith Memorandum on Intelligence Activity

(Item 1 of May 14, request) I see no reason to withhold access to

Item P.

Accordingly, I recommend that Mic. Elliff be granted

personal access to Exhibits K, I, and P, at the offices of the

Intelligence Division. I am sending a contemporaneous copy of

this memo to Mr. Mintz of the FBI.

Bergeron was contacted by SSC Staff Member

Michael Ipstein, who asked to intervier Bergeron at

10:00 a.B. June 27, 1975, at the SSC offices. Bergeron

contacted

the FBI fos the purposes of inquiring as to

release fron a secrecy agreenent with the FBI and to secure

consultation assistance at the tine of the interviev in

the event the interview led into privileged areas such as

relating to possible identification of FBI sources and

possibly affecting ongoing investigations. On June 27, 1975,

fron any applicable employment agreement for the purposes

of the SSC interview concerning the FBI investigations of

by an FBI representative who made himself available for

possible consultation purposes but this reprosentative vas

never called upon during the intervier.

Bergeron was intervieved in SSC quarters for the

approxinate period of 10:20 all, to 11:20 a.I. June 27, 1975.

The interview vas to have commenced at 10:00 a.I., but

Epstein devoted approximately 20 minutes arcanging for

adequate space for the interview. In addition to lipstein,

another stait Menber, Mary deured, was present. She took

notes in longhand throughout the interview and also partici-

pated in some of the questioning to a small degree.

At the

outset, Bergeron was advised of his right to counsel and

other rights and told that if he gave any information

Indicating a possible violation of Federal law, his infornation

would be turned over to the Department of Justice. The

interview vas not under oath and was not pursuant to a

subpoena. The details of the interview are set out below,

not necessarily in chronological order.

Bergeron was asked for biographic data insofar as

his FBI career was concerned and he advised that he had

entered the FBI in a clerical capacity in 1940 and vas

assigned to the Washington Field Office (UFO) of the FBI

from October, 1942, until his retirement in September, 1965,

almost the entire period as an SA.

Bergeron was questioned and furnished infornation

about the organization of UFO, principally relating io the

squads engaged in security work. He vas asked to idencify

supervisory and other personnel attached to the various

security squads when he worked in TO and in most instances

his replies were that due to time lapse he was unable to

furnish specific names. He pointed out that it there was

made available to him the various personnel directories

of WFO down through the years he might batter be able to

respond to such inquiries.

• Questioning turned to the FBI investigation of

Martin luther King, Jr., and specifically to electronic

coverage of King at the Willard Hotel in Vashington, D. C.,

in the mid-1960's.

He was asked how this coverage came

about and responded that he uas called into the office of

the Security Coordinator in VFO, Luävig V. R. Oberndorf

(deceased). Present vere an FBI Assistant Director, William C.

Sullivan, SA William Welch (deceased) and two to four other

WEO SAs, names not nov recalled.

This conference was led

by Sullivan, who explained that king and some of his

associates vere coming to Washington, D. G., and that the

Bureau desired to effect technical coverage on king.

was Sullivan's information that King had spent time in

New York City and had been discovered to have a number of

communist contacts there.

Because of these contacts, the

FBI interest in King was a national security matter, according

to Sullivan.

Bergeron was asked whether Sullivan mentioned

the specific types of coverage desired and Bergeron could

not rccall beyond the generic description of technical.

Bergeron explained that S4 Welch was present because he vas

the hotel contact man for WFO. It was assumed that because

King was coming to Washington, D. C., with several other

individuals, they vould probably stay at a hotel rather than

in someone's home. It was therefore believed desirable to

utilize the help of an SA who had contacts with the various

hotels.

the ones which had been reserved for King and his party.

This tas part of the feasibility survey which Bergeron.

performed to determine whether it would be feasible to make

a technical installation, Bergeron being a trained "sound man."

Bergeron tas queried as to who made the decision

as to the ezaci types of coverage to be put in effcot and

Bergeron replied that he himself nade that decision. He vas

asked if there was office correspondence authorizing an

installation and Bergeron responded that there vas--that he

alvays insisted that there be when he made an installation.

Bergeron explained that the authorization could have been

either of tuo types. The Bureau letter might have authorized

only a feasibility survey; or it might have authorized both

feasibility survey and installation.

Bergeron said that he

had seen whatever paper there was containing the authorization

even though such correspondence would be addressed to the

Special Agent in Charge (SAG). le explained the routing of

such mail thereby the SAG would route it to the appropriate

supervisor and then to the si who vas to make the installation.

In response to general questioning, Bergeron

advised that electronic suveillances might start in co

different ways. One would be when a field office would

originate the correspondence and the other would be when FBI

Headquarters would originate the correspondence.

In response to questions concerning the type and

nature of the installation, Bergeron made at the Willard Hotel,

he advised that he had placed a transmitter in each of two

Bergeron vas asked whether any tolephone surveillance

vas installed and he roplica that none had bech rade in tho

Villard Hotel. Dergoron could not rccall hother or not

the Eureau had aste foi such a surveillunce. In any event,

Bergeron explained that such a surveillance would have been

too complicated because of the presence of a switchboard at

the hotel. Bergeron was asked whether he could have used

switchboard operators to assist in such a survelllance and

his response as "no."

Bergeron was nost askod if he had

over put a eclophonc survoillanca in any hotcl roon und ho

responded, "Io you mean in the lling case?" Epstein then

asked if Bergeron had made such an installation in any case

and Bergeron advised Ipstein that he vas cleared to discuss

only the King case.

Questioning then turned to the matter of the

monitoring of the nicrophone susveillance which he had

Installed. Dezgoron explained that thay roguirod tvo rooms

for such monitoring and that there were utilized in these

rooms radio receivers and tape recorders. Upon request,

Bergeron gave the name of Bill Campbell as one of the SAs

doing the monitosing and said there was another SA, name

unrecalled. Bergeron indicated that he himself listened

Bergeron advised that he probably saw transcripts of the

monitoring but again could not recall any of the contonts.

He was questioned as to what happencd to the logs and

transcripts and replied that he assumed that they had been

sent to FBI Headquarters. As to the tapes themselves,

Bergeron Indicated he had no idea of what disposition vas

made of then.

Bergeron tas

asked if WO had a file on King

prior to the situation described above and he advised he

had no knowledge on that matter.

He was asked if he knew of any other similar

coverage on King in other places and his response was that

any affirmative ansver he might give rould be mere hearsay.

Epstein inquired of Bergeron as to who he had

talked to after Ipstein first called him to arcange the

interview.

Bergeron told Epstein that he had talked to

another FBI SA, Ernest Belter (previously interviewed by SSC

Staff). Epstein inquired as to why Bergeron had contacted

Belter and Bergeron told Epstein that he did it for the

purpose of thanking Belter for "small favors" because Belter

had supplied Bergeron's name to Epstain.

Eargeron also

explained that he called Belter, who he had learned had

already been interviewed by the SSC, to find out vho he,

Bergeron, should talk to in the Bureau about any forthcoming

intervier.

In response to questioning, Bergeron told Epstein

that earlier that morning he had seen FBI Assistant Director

John Mintz and SA Willian 0. Gregar in connection with

obtaining the necessary clearance prior to being interviewed.

He was asked if they had discussed the King case with him

and he responded that they hau not. He vas asked if he

had revieved any FBI files prior to the interview and ho

responded that he had not. He as asked if any filos vece

offered to him and he responded that none had been offered

him.

He was asked whether he had requested an opportunity

to revier FBI files and he replied that he had not made any

such request.

Miss Debreo then asked Bergeron if it vas his

decision to not look at FBI files to refresh his memory

prior to the interview. He responded by advising that he

no longer worked for the FBI and therefore believed he had

no right to revier FBI files.

Questioning then turned to the matter of photogenphic

coverage of King at the Willard Hotel and in response to a

direct question, Bergeron advised there vas no such coverage.

He was asked whether any "surreptitious coverage" vas

utilized and his cesponse was that none had been used. He

was questioned concerning possible use of TV coverage and

responded that none was used, Bergeron explained that they

were talking about a period over 10 years ago when such

equipment tas not reacly as well developed as it is today.

Then it appeared that the interview was concluded,

Bergeron inquired as to whether the interviewers vere

"Einished" with him. Ipstein indicated that they were not

and that they would probably call hin back again because of

Bergeron's "broad general knowledge of intelligence activictes."

Bergeron disclaimed such knowleûge.

NOTE:

Bergeron was accompanied to the interview by

SAS. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project, who also

debriefed Bergeron as reported herein. The advice given to

Bergeron prior to the interview concerning being released

Attached is a request for further detailed information from

Senate Select Cormittee, regarding COINTELPRO, from Mr. Elliff dated

July 1, 1975.

Please note that this matter is considered and characterized

as an "abuse" (see page 21 of enclosures to SSC letter of June 27,

previously forwarded); accordingly, any Agent interview would be an

"abuse interview" subject to the strictures set forth in the "Outline"

for Inquiry Procedures" referenced in the SSC letter of June 27.

Because of this, I feel we should discuss the procedures for inter-

view which may be sought under page 2, paragraph "Interviews" of

Mr. Elliff's attached letter. It may be that the matter should be

discussed with the Deputy Attorney General as well, after Mr. Levi

has responded to the SSC letter of June 27. A significant legal

problem may be presented by the compulsion of Agents' appearance.

Please also note the attached Departmental decision on the interpre-

tation of "demand" in 28 C.F.R., 16.21 et. sea. This decision will

bear on our resolution of the pending

Be lan problem.

In the meantime, please arrange for the preparation of an

Interpretation of "'Demand"

ALL FEI INTORMATION CONTAINED

DATE N14,0U

28 C.F.R., $ 16:21

, et. sed. = Action Memorandum

The meaning of "demand" Is not, indicated, beyond subpoena, in

the C.F.R. sections indicated.

This omission creates a need for an

Interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for Inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the

White House and the Senate Select Conmittee on June 13, 1975, and a

copy of those procedures was furnished to the Department on June 16,

1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the

Cormittee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time beiore

the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former

employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in

the guidelines. The Cormittee is required to provide the witness with

a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or

agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". The Cormittee is required

to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-

ject area; (b) periods of employment; (c) the date set for the interview.

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the

Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it

seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., $ 16.21, et. sea.,

which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request

by any Cormittee staff member to interview any employee, former employee

or other person connected with the Department of Justice.

This Interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit-

ness be authorized to speak under § 16.23 by an appropriate Departient

Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designated

I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI should

be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, in coordination

with this office.

NOTE:

The 6/24/75 SSC letter made reference to prior SSC

request pertaining to the FBI investigation of Martin Luther King,

Jr., and indicated that of the persons listed in the letter,

with only two exceptions (Larry Gurley and William D. Campbell),

all were believed to have served at either Atlanta or Albany,

Georgia, with the FBI. Gurley and Campbell were understood

to have

been assigned to FBIHQ. In attempting to identify

correctly the individuals listed because of misspellings of

names, we ran down the fact that with the exception of Gurley

and Campbell, all had at one time served in the Atlanta Field

Office except for a John Bassett. The only current or

former Agent by this name is assigned to Chicago and has never

rechecked with Mike Epstein of the SSC Staff who advised that

the John Bassett in Chicago is the correct one.

S. F. Phillips

of the Senstudy 75 Project telephonically contacted Bassett

6/26/75 and determined Bassett not only has never been assigned

to Atlanta but he has no recollection of having ever worked on

the King case. Notwithstanding, we are including Bassei's current

office of assignment as requested, even though ve currently do

worth tanned,

not know specifically why the SSC is considering interviewing him.

of the House Committee on the Judiclary

• Responses to the aforementioned questions are set

forth below and appear in the same order as posed.

1. The FBI conducts surveillances of dononstrationa

occurting on or near federal property; at other locations

whon facts indicate a violation of federal statutes over

which the in has investigative jurisdiction may occur; ot

at a sito where individuals of investigative interest to

tho Bi are present or the demonstration is sponsored by

an organization of investigative interest.

In this instanco,

the FEI had received information fron a source, who has

provided reliable information in the past, that an organiza-

tion of investigative interest to the ruI

would be aticapting

to gain publicity by entering the Federal Building in Akron,.

cresting disturbances and deracing federal property.

This

organization has been determined to be influenced by a

separate organization vnich espuuses a basic Mazzlet-

Leninist jacist revolutionary ideology. Investigation o

both of theso organizations is based on infornation which

indicates they may be engaged in activitios which could

InVOlVO VIOLaTIONS Of TItle 10, United States Code,

Sections 2503 (kepeinion or insurresiion), 2004 (Seditious

2337 (Sedition).

and

In addition, inasmuch as the possibility

existed individuals present at the denonstration would

atteant to dosace Federal property, there was reason to

believe a violation ot tazle 18, United States Code,

Section 1361 (Destruction o1 Govorament Property) could occur.

At a later date, additional inframation nas recoived fron a

second source, who has provided reliable Information in the

past, that the demonstration ad the federal Building in AkroA

sould be to protest United States involvement in Southeast

Asia, and leaflets urging support of this denonstration vera

being distributed in the Akron-Keut, Ohio, aren.

In

keeping with existing rel policy, tho Abion Police Department

and the General Services Administration Building Manager in

charge of the Akron Federal Building vere notified of the

Impending demonstration and of information received indicating

a possibality mat disruptive activity would occur during

the demonstration.

Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights

of the house committee on the Judiclasy

Survalllance in this case nas not related to any

bomb threat; hovever, based on the information stated above,

there was reason ics

the IBi to suspect that there might be

violations of Federal statutes over which the FBI has investi

gative jurisdiction.

In the event such violations did occur,

It would be necessary that Agents be present to gather the

necessary evidence.

The FBI did bave an interest relating to tho

Identitios of the pasticular individuals who veze involved

in crganizing the demonstzation.

One such individual, who

played a key role in plans to cause disruptive activity and

1u organizing the denonstration, has been arrested and

convicted for abusa to a polica officer, resisting arcast,

discideny conduct,

trespassing, and disrupting lawful

assembly in the past and has been described by a sourco,

mho has nroutind reliable information in the past,

to have indicated in the past a dosize to "get sonething

22523

going vith the police." This same Individual is also

considered by the source to be unstable and violence-prone.

In addition. the individuals planning the demonstration,

as previously mentioned, vere afiiiated with an cganiza

2. Thora feze no known violations of Federal 0s

local statutes during the demonstration; thore was no violence;

there vore no arzests as a result of the demonstration.

Both visual and phobographic suveillances were conducted by

the ISI during the demonstration. Cussent Tal instructions

state that photographic surveillances should be considesod on

& selective basis when circunstancos indicate they may be

productive. The decision-naking authority in such a matter

Is vested in the Spocial Agent in Charge of the pasticuler

headquarters field office of the IBI, his assistant in hig

absence, os the Agent supervisor acting on their behalf in

the absence of both. In the eveni unusual circunatances

exist, the Special Agent in Charge of a particular Ilold

office mould sequest authority fron ILI Headquasters in

Washington, D. C., to conduct a photorraphic curvolllanes.

Photographs were taken for the possible evidentiary purpose of

recciding anilcipated events leading to the parpetration of an

act by one or more demonstratcas in violation of the Federal

statute concerning destruction of Governmant proporty, as vell

as recording on filn any overt act. FbI Agents obsezved the

denonstration for the same reason and for the additlonal purpose

ci effecting, li necessary, the arrests of individuals violating

Fodcial statutes.

at the House Committee on the Judiciary

Both prints and negatives of photographs taken by

the FEI have been maintained, from the time processed, as

exhibits in recoras of the FBI's Cleveland Office.

The

filn was developed because, among the approximately 15

denonstrators present outsite the Akron Federal Building,

Agents recognized five individuals known to be airiliated

with the organization in which the rBI had investigative

interest.

In tha event photographs depicting these individuals

were of better quality than existing photographs, the improved

ones would be, in accordance with Ill policy and

in 1ina vith

an agreement between the IBI and the Secret Service concerning

Presidential protection, forwarded to the Secret Service for

possible future use by that agency in connection with its

responsibilities.

The photographs obtained, however, were

not suitable for

this purpose.

Prints of these photographs were not made avartavio

to the Alcon Police Department, were not forwarded to TBI

Headquarters in Washington, D. C., and veze not made available

to anyone else. These prints were not retained at the Akron

FBI Resident Agency, but were sent to the Cleveland IBI

Office and are maintained in the IILeS of cuzi

3.

The Akron IBI Resident Agency did make an

attempt to identify the unknown participants in the

demonstration fron the photographs talen during the demonstra

tion,

Information concerning the identities of some of the

denonstrators wus provided by the Akzon Resident Agency to

the Intolligence Division, Alcon Police Department, lor the

purposo of bringing to their attention the identities of those

Individual participants who have bsen involved in disruntive

ectivitles 1D the past and who may become so involvod again

in the future. One of the individuals so identified to the

Akron Police Departient has reportedly urged "spontaneous

violence" at a denonstration in the past.

Files of the IEI are not maintained at the Resident

Agency level; therelore, information concerning the identities

of sone of the demonstrators has been placed and is being

maintained in the files of the Cleveland FBI Office.

(D) ATTÄCHE PHOTOCOPY UNITS - PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT -

The Attache Photocopy Units are portable document copy equipment. These

units are now available for field use. The enclosure shows one of these

units in various stages

of assembly. Units will be furnished to each office

having available a Special Agent who has received the Laboratory's

specialized training on surveillance photography. The equipment will

be sent by FBI Laboratory invoice, and on receipt of the equipment

appropriate investory additions should be made, gecording the serial number

of the unit along with the serial number oi the camera and of the lens.

Panatomic X film for use in this equipment can be requisitioned from Bureau

supply.

This document copy equipment is completely self-contained,

requires no outside power source and, therefore, can be used to copy

documents in an automobile or at any location without regard to the avail-

ability of electric power of any kind. These units are contained in regular

attache cases measuring 18 inches by 12 inches by 4 3/4 inches and the

gross weight of each unit is 16 pounds. The units are assembled by raising

the supporting sides into upright positions and placing the camera-light

assembly in position on top of these sides. The lights are then swung

to the sides to complete the assembly. An assembled copy unit may be

used, either standing in the attache case, or removed from it. Documents

up to legal size may be copied in a single exposure but large documents may

be copied in sections by multiple exposures if the units are removed from the

attache cases. Complete operating instructions are included with each unit.

The lights in the Attache Photocopy Units are electron phototlash

lights and are powered by a 90-volt battery which is good for a minimum of

1000 exposures. The camera used in the equipment is a standard 35 mm

Minolta SR-1 camera with a 35mm f4 Rokkor lens. These cameras take

standard 36 exposure loads of film, have rapid wind levers and may be

reloaded without detaching from the units.

Kodak Panatomic X or equivalent

ASA 50 film requires an exposure of 1/15 second at f1l or 1/8 second at 116

in these units.

Attache Photocopy Units have already been furnished to New York,

Washington Field, Jackson, Miami, and Atlanta. In the near future units

will be forwarded to Albany, Albuquerque, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston,

Buffalo, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Honolulu,

Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Knoxville, Las Vegas,

Little Rock, Los Angeles, Louisville, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Mobile,

Newark, New Haven, New Orleans, Norfolk, Oklahoma City, Omaha,

Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Richmond, St. Louis, San

Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Juan, Seattle, and Springhield.

Request for additional Attache Photocopy Units or request from offices not

receiving units at this time should be made by letter marked for the attention

of the FBI Laboratory.

(B) LAUTOMOTIVE EQUIPMENT USED IN SURVEILLANCES - You are

reminded of the necessity that automotive equipment used in surveillances

be sufficiently varied as to minimize the danger that persons under

surveillances will recognize it as "policemen's equipment." A limited

amount of special surveillance equipment is located in the various offices.

Efforts will be made in the future to augment this equipment. Until

procurement of sufficiently varied automotive equipment can be obtained,

you are authorized to make appropriate use of rental equipment where

necessary; however, it is your responsibility to see that such rental

equipment is compietely justified.

Whenever such use will be extensive

and the cost is estimated to exceed siu, prior bureau authority must be

obtained and may be obtained on an expedite basis. You are reminded of

the importance of maintaining special surveillance vehicles and equipment

in a secure manner to insure none of our surveillances are in any way

jeopardized. Existing regulations require that all radio-equipped

surveillance trucks be provided separate garage and storage treatinent.

The desirability of maintaining other surveillance automotive equipment

separately from our normal equipment should be carefully evaluated.

Where circumstances dictate, such equipment should be provided the

same separate facilities as is now required of radio-equipped surveillance

trucks. Appropriate manual changes concerning the rental of surveillance

equipment will be forthcoming.

(EL) VESPIONAGE AND FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

SURVEILLANCES

OF SOVIET-BLOC PERSONNEL - For years Soviet officials in the United

States have made numerous and repeated trips throughout this country

aimed at obtaining valuable data regarding our air bases, missile

sites and other important defense installations.

In recent years

they have coordinated their activities in this regard with the

satellite countries and in this way are getting coverage of areas

3 the Undted states closed to soviet travel.

In connection with our responsibility in regard to coverage

of Soviet-bloc activities, these Soviet-bloc officials have been

placed under surveillance.

Many offices have participated in these

surveillances, and it appears that this activity on the part of the

Soviet bloc will continue.

On May 16, 1962, a number of newspapers in the United

"the official

Soviet Government newspaper, alleged that during a recent tour of

the United States he was constantly shadowed by the

"American secret

service."

He also alleged newspaper reporters and television men

"close business connections with the FBI" because reporters met

him at the railroad station in Portland, Oregon, when he arrived

there. He alleged he was under heavy surveillance in seattle,

Washington, and furnished license numbers of

two automobiles

he

alleged were conducting surveillance of him in Los Angeles,

California.

The Bureau determined that the allegations of the Soviet

correspondent were completely false and undoubtedly were an attempt

by the Soviets to embarrass this Bureau and to curtail our counter-

intelligence operations.

There is a definite possibility other

Soviet-bloc personnel may make similar charges in the future and

in this connection may attempt to obtain proof of their allegations,

such as obtaining photographs of Bureau cars or surveillance agents.

It is known that bloc personnel have made numerous attempts to do

this in the past.

We do not intend to allow a false allegation by the

Soviet bloc to alter coverage of their activities.

Our surveil-

lances undoubtedly have hampered the Soviets in collection of

intelligence data in the United States, and we can expect them

to create or utilize any incident they can as a basis for protest

against our coverage.

It is desired, therefore, that the above

facts be

called to the attention of all agents. It should be pointed

out that while the Bureau desires our

coverage of Soviet-bloc

official$ to be as complete as possible, the surveillance

must be discreet and every precaution must be taken to avoid

giving the soviets a basis for protest.

You should impress upon agents handling surveillances

of Soviet-bloc personnel in the United States that they

constantly exercise keen alertness, careful planning and

judgment in handling all facets of our surveillance operations.
