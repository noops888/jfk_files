CUBA
THE EXCHANGE OF INTELLIGENCE
CONCERNING COMMUNIST SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES

I. Introduction

In combatting the many forms of Castro-Communist
subversion now pursued throughout Latin America frem the
Communist base of operations in Cuba, there is a funda-
mental requirement fer intelligence -- a requirement which
4involves not only the timely acquisitien and processing of
information, but also its rapid dissemination, on a select-
ive basis, to those who need to know. Efforts are now
being made by CIA, AID, and the U.S. Military Services to
improve Latin American intelligence systems. Success thus
far has béen limited. This effort must be vigoreusly con-
tinued. It is not with this preblem, however, that this
paper is primarily concerned, but rather with that of
exchanging essential information among those who need te
know it. A greater degree ef Inter-American cooperatien

is required in this regard than has hitherto been achieved.

II. The Nature and Scope of the Problem

1. Limiting Factors
There are many legitimate inhibitions which tend

to discourage the exchange of intelligence on an

international basis, even among allies. National

privacy with regard to the inner workings of an

intelligence system must be preserved, Further com-

pounding the problem insofar as Latin America is

concerned is the divisive influence of the long

history of rivalries, wars, jealousies and dis-

putes which have characterized relations among the

many nations concerned. The wounds of past con-

flicts among pairs and groupings of nations are

by no means completely healed. For example, there

is lingering hostility between Peru and Ecuador

deriving from their boundary war in which Ecuador os tte
lost a vast area of its territory. Chie do Ra
Bolivia continue at odds over them?| seme dis-

pute, and, even now, Nicaraguan insurgents are

harbored within the borders of Costa Rica.

Latin America is not a homogeneous entity in
ethnic, social, political, arid economic background,
and there is a great variety of attitudes toward
the Castro-Communist subversive menace. A cém-
pletely unified approach toward exchange or intell-
igence concerning this menace, therefore, cannot
be regarded as practicable.

The realities outlined above indicate that
multilateral intelligence exchange must be approached
on a strictly limited basis. It should not be
concluded, however, that nothing of value can be
done multilaterally. With proper definition limit-
ing the problem of exchange to matters directly
related to communist subversive activities, such
as the movement to and from Cuba of subversives,

the production and movement of propaganda materials,

&

and the movement of arms, it should be possible

to encourage a greater degree of cooperation, /It

the requirement to protect national secrets as to

sources and methods employed. The latter, which can
be of great value, can be exchanged without fear of
ompromise,

An additional impediment to intelligence exchange
is the low level of competence of most Latin American
intelligence services, their lack of rapid, secure
means of communication, and the complete absence of
adequate security systems. [securaty consciousness AT
is not a Latin American characteristic./ The lack of
security safeguards must necessarily limit the ex-
change of intelligence obtained covertly by any of
the nations involved, and particularly the United
States, which has the most sophisticated system and
hence the greatest need for protection.

The governments of some countries, of which
Guatemala is a good example, have little desire to
develop a competent career security service. There
is a fear that the existence of an efficient service
would constitute a threat to further activities of
members of the existing governments at such time as
they might find themselves out of power. Moreover,
many Latin American intelligence services display
a tendency to yield to the temptation to label as
“subversives" those of their own nationals resident

in other countries who are opposed to the existing

government. These considerations limit the possi- pu

2. Current Exchange Arrangements G

At present there is little or no organized ex-

change of intelligence among the Latin American na-
tiens. There is a limited amount of informal ex-
change, often on a basis of personal relationships
of government officials having a community of in-
terest with respect toa particular matter.

The Central Intelligence Agency has established
working liaison arrangements in seme Latin American
countries where such relations have been considered to
be in the best interest of the United States. Most
of the intelligence concerning subversion in Latin
America available to the CIA is derived from covert
eperations or through contacts with another intelli-
gence or security service. This inhibits the pass-
age of such information to agencies of a third coun-
try. There is, however, 4 substantial amount of
intelligence available from overt or non-sensitive

sources which can be provided to other countries.

In 1962, for exdmple, CIA received information re-

ports from services. with which liaison is main-

tained in Latin America and released reports to

recipients. Intelligéhee items exchanged iricluded
collated studies, weekly intelligence reviews, name
traces and travel reports.

The U.S. Army, through its attaches, currently
has an informal arrangement involving bilateral ex-
changes of intelligence with Argentina, Colombia,
Ecuador, Uruguay, Peru, Paraguay and Venezuela. MIh-
formation provided by the Army has been concerned
with subversive personalities, communist infiltre-
tion, weapons movements and related matters. Re-
ciprocal intelligence received has been of minimal
value. The Army also provides selected informa-
tion on subversive activities to Brazil, Chile,
Guatemala and Mexico, although there is no recip-
rocal arrangement. The attaches of other U.S.
Services practice limited exchange on a selective
basis.

Some information has been released from time to
time to Latin American countries by the Commander-in-
Chief, Caribbean Command, operating through the

Military Groups.

As yet, however, the program for the provision by
United States agencies of information on subversion
to Latin American governments has not been developed
to an adequate degree Since the United States

possesses the WOO a Sttic capabilities,
as well as the only secure and reliable means of
rapid communication throughout Latin America (current-
ly in process of improvement), the development of an
integrated United States system for bilateral ex-
change offers the greatest possibility of achieving
the results desired. United States experience in
the matter of intelligence exchange in Latin America
and in other areas of the world has led to the
conclusion that bilateral arrangements are more
fruitful than multilateral arrangements such as
those established within the framework of NATO,
CENTO and SEATO, Nevertheless, this experience
has shown also that multilateral arrangements can
be of some use, particularly in creating an aware-
ness of the need for intelligence exchange.

The concept of an exchange of information among
members of the OAS with regard to subversive activities

has been put forward on numerous [eceastons-=t_ ORS

and other Inter-American meetings, commencing with
the Inter-American Conference at Bogota in 1948,
At Punta del Este in 1962, OAS members were urged
to cooperate in strengthening their capacity to
counteract threats or acts of aggression, subversion
or other dangers to peace and security. More
recently, the Council of the OAS established the
"Special Consultative Committee on Security (Sccs)"
to consider the specific resolutions on security
problems adopted at Punta del Este. The SCCS has
requested all American governments to furnish in-
formation on Castro-Communist activities to sérve
as the basis for studies and recommendations by the
OAS on the nature of the threat and means of dealing
with it.

These actions by the OAS have yielded little
or nothing in terms of concrete results. The in-
dividual Latin American countries have shown little
inclination to proceed with implementing actions
pursuant to the resolutions adopted.

This brief summary serves to illustrate that
there is much room for expansion of bilateral in-

telligence exchange arrangements among the Latin

American nations themselves, which is now minimal
at best, as well as a need to create an expanded
program for bilateral intelligence exchange be-
tween the United States and individual countries,
and finally, a requirement to suerte the possibili-
ties of a multilateral approach within the recog-
nized limitations involved.

III. Actions Recommended

1. Increase the existing bilateral exchange of in-
telligence conducted by CIA, DOD, and other US Agencies
where it is found possible to establish appropriate
arrangements for the exchange of selected information
consistent with security requirements.

2, Establish intelligence centers at Caribbean Com-
mand and Caribbean Sea Frontier headquarters for fur-
ther dissemination of intelligence as appropriate in
conjunction with the Military Arepeing System, for
rapid processing and atsseninetttnyor Mieaiisgence on
subversive activity directly to the countries concerned

through the American embassies therein.

4, Increase the dissemination to Latin Amer: can
governments, by all US agencies concerned, of uncilassi-
fied studies, reports and other non-sensitive informa-
tion concerning Communist subversion.

5. Encourage Latin American countries to engage in v

6. Continue the development at high priority of U.S.
communications in Latin America.

7. Increase emphasis on the provision of U.S. in-

telligence advisors to Latin American countries, <>

8. Intensify and increase existing AID, CIA, and
Military programs for the training and equipping of
