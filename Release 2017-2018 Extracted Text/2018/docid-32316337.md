Set forth below is information furnished by
BU 280-C* concerning events which occurred at Niagara
Falls, N.Y., on the dates indicated:

On 6/5/63, informant advised that SAM (LNU)
visited PETER A, MAGADDINO. From information furnished
by this informant on 6/5 and later on 6/15, it is
possible to identify SAM as being SALVATORE MIANO, aka
Sam. : :

SAM told PETER A. MAGADDINO that he had made
what he considered a fair offer to-an unidentified person
involving squaring off a building, but had not heard
anything from this man. He had contacted AL (Attorney
AL PACINI?) that morning and had been told that this
other man's attorney had not called.

MIANO pointed out that he actually wanted no
part of this matter, but only wanted to be a silent partner
