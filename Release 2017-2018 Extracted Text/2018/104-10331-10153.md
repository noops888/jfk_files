vA The JFK Board addressed six Agency issues at the 13 May meeting. The Agency's proposals prevailed in four of the six issues
~aee-one-and one issue was tabled for further discussion. The Board made the following determinations:

1) Alias Documentation and Accommodation Addresses:

accepted our proposal to postpone release of specific information until 2017 and use generic substitute language.

2)(LITAMIL-S [CIA penetratia
City story}: -

‘onsidered a "key player” in the Oswald-Mexico

agreed to continue to protect the full crypt and delay the release of additional documents (201 file) until his death.
They set an annual review date on the documents; the Agency will need to advise NARA annually on his status.

ee ' : : SECRET

agreed to protect true name and 201 file numbers of assets not previously released.
5) Mark Lane ttem [extract from foreign document]:

postponed until 4 June meeting; board would like have a member or its staff confirm the existence of the ’
document and ensure that it contains no other JFK assassination related information.

6) Carles Tepedino [CIA asset/ key figure in AMLASH-Cubela plot to kill Castro/true name and role in story has
been publicly known for years):

voted to release his name in the 1967 1G Report on Plots Against Castro and other JFK collection documents

The} jolitsyn issue was pulled from the agencd and will be addressed at the next meeting (4 June).

This was a very successful meeting from the Agency's perspective. The loss on Tepedino was not unexpected. Given what is
in the public domain, the Agency has not been able to make a persuasive argument to protect his name in the three yéars Tepedino has
been at issue. Thanks to all who assisted in preparing for the meeting, and especially a ia prepared the
issue and talking point papers that carried the day. 7
