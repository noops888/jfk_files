1.

The presence of so many new desk personnel at

headquarters

•people who are unfamiliar with station

history - means that we must turn to you with questions

oftener than you might wish.

Our present question

concerns property involved in LIsApPY.

(We are submitting

the project as received from the fleld, but do not

understand the background very well.)

HMMA-11257 of 16. January 1959,

a project renewal, said

tbat

"approximately one year ago the LICALLA base

purchased by KUBARK through: LIMOUSINE", and we have not found

any cables or dispatches which would show a change in that

status.

Does NEXI 03 LINUST/LIMESA (see Real Property Beport

of August 1yG7) Include LICALLA? If 50,

and 11 we own

LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and

utilities?

(Up until the subaission dated 1963 the project

reneral used to

Bay

*LIMITED and RICALLA rents are returned,

to station by LIMOUSINS and credited to station miscellaneous

receipts" but after that time this sentence vas elininated.)
