1, Primary responsibility for the operational and
udministrative handling of the LIEMPTY Project was transferred,
effective 1 Decomber 1970, within the Station from the RED'OP
to the Operational Support Section, This transfer was made
as part of our effort to consolidate basic Support functions
in the Operational Support Section, and to relieve tho REDTOP
Section of activities. which do not contr!bute directly to the
pursuit.of priority recruitment targets. However, the REDTOP
Section will continue to be the principal consumer of the
LIEMPTY product as received from the LILYRIC and LICALLA
photo surveillance points, It will also be the maia provid
er of guidnnce and requests for apecfal LILYRIC/LICALLA

__C© LIEMPTY Properties a

REFERENCE: HMMI-15952, 27 November 1967

1. Headquarters’ confusion regarding the various LIS\PTY
properties is understacdable, although each change in location
was duly reported as it occurred, and at various times project
renewal requests, progress reports, and other correspondence has
pinpointed the locations of the base houses involved, The con-
fusion undoubtedly stems from the unfortunate fact that LIMITED
and LILYRIC in effect exchanged approximate locations in 1966
without changing cryptonyas, Up to this point, LIMITED bad beea
in a building owned by WOFIRN (with LIMOUSINE fronting for MOFIRY).
LILYRIC had been renting an‘apartment in a building in which
WOFIRM had no financial interest. {n 1965, howevex, LINOUSINE
bought the property coatai: the building in which LIMITED had
been located, Taced iie iuiiding,-and built a new building in
which an apartment was rented to the Station (the rent, however,
was to be returned to the Station for three years as partial
Payment on the joan which the Station had given LIMOUSINE so that
he could buy the building), For various operational reasous it
was decided to put the LILYRIC personnel into the new building,
instead of the LIMITED crew, LIMITED was therefore moved into the

- building which LILYRIC had occupied. at, this point, of course,
new cryptonyms should probably have been: assigned in order to
avoid the. confusion which has evidently developed, (‘This vas not,
however, simply a switch of personnel ~ eaci: base house retained
its organizational integrity, which is undoubtedly why crypts were
not changed), AS tar as LICAILA is concerned, the confusion

mentioned in LIMESA progress renewal requests, The Station under-
stands that'a memo describing the locations of the various base
houses was attached to tle most récent LIMESA project. renewal
request when it was submitted to the staits by WH/L.

2, Personnel within the base houses 1s also well-documented
(most of the LIEMPTY progress reports have identified each agent
in eack house),: and the personnel have uever been switched from
house to house. Perhaps the best rundown of these persdnnel is
Raymond H. GERENDE's security review, forwarded with IIMMA-31164,
24 January 1967, : A

3, “Station Real Property reports are also, with one
exception (MEXI-41), up-to-date and they reflect current condi~
tions, MEXI-03 does, of course, include LICALLA, Nevertheless,
the Station asked for $1800 for rent-and utilities for the
following reasons: first of all, utilities are an unrecoverable
expense no matter who owns the apartment, Secondly, the'rent,
even though returned to the Station because jWJFIRM owns[ the
building, must physically he paid by the occupant of LICALLA.

He, in turn, is reimbursed by the Station via GERENDE, | LIMOUSINE
eventually returns the money, at which tine it is credited to
expense, This could, of course, be handled differently, but the
Station has always found it convenient to finance in this manner,
largely because finances with LIMOUSINE are handled on a'semi-
annual basis, The reimbursement, therefore, often comes, many

months after the payment. {

4, The Station neglected to cancel MZxXI-41, which, should
be done as it refers to LILYRIC in its old location, before the
move in 1966, LILYRIC is now MEXI-132, and is in the building
owned by LIMOUSINE, Rent payments are, as originally jatended;
being used to help liquidate LIMOUSINE's déebt, and, as instructed
in HMMS-4814, 15 June 1966, the Station f= crediting this
to miscellaneous receipts, There can be, therefore, nol question
of the need to include money for LILYRIC rent and utilities in

the LIEMPTY project, LILYRIC rent 1s, and has been since the
apartment was occupied in October 1966, 3,900 pesos per, month,
which amounts to $2,889 per year ($3,200 has been requested in
order to include utilities), Headquarters is correct ini stating
that the agreed-upon figure for the rent in this new building
was 2,300 pesos per month, Station files indicate that the
reason for the iocrease (and this apparently was not reported
-to Headquarters) was that the bank which holds the major. part

of LIMOUSINE's loan had determined ‘that 3,900 pesos was a fair
price for the apartment, The Station had, of course, 7 choice

but to go along with this, t

5, The Station has no record of MEXI-02, but it is likely
that this is the old LIMITED apartment, which was indeed
purchased by WOFIRN (via LIMOUSINE) tn 1955, But since that
building was later purchased and razed by WSINE, the old
LUUITED apartuent ceased to exist. The LIMITED base house was
subsequently transferred to the building which had previously

September 1969, returned to the Station by LIMOUSINE and credited

LIMOUSINE."

G6, Finally, the LIEMPTY darkroom is the room where the
films taken by LICALLA, LILYRIC, LIMITED, and LIENTRAP are
developed, printed, ‘and (on request) enlarged by LISkeTY-4,

This darkroom is located in GERENDS's apartment, and he is patd
1,000 pesos per month for maintenance of the darkroom in
recognition of the fact that one room in his living quarters

has been turned into a darkroom, and his electric and vater
bills are substantially higher than they would normally be with-
out a darkroom on the premises. GERENDE if building a house
which he expects to occupy in February 19068. ‘His plans for the
house specifically include a LIEMPTY darkroom, and he will continue
to be paid 1,000 pesos per month for this. To cover this payment
in the new house, NEXI-137 has been written and will be forwarded
to Headquarters shortly,

3, LIMITED 1s a different problem complicated by
the fact. that we are no-longer sure what the nane refers
to. Originally we bought LIMITED and then sold {t in
January 1965 to LIMOUSINE who put up a new building on
the lot-and Saved an apartment for our use.  LiMOUSINE
now owns thé new building, but"MEXI 02, LIMITED Safchouse"’
4s shown on the Real Property Report as "purchased" by
WOFIRM in 1955 - should this not be corrected? A further
complication is that HMMA -31164, GERENDE's January 1967
security review, speaks of LILYRIC in its present new

‘Yocation, inhabited by LIEMPTY/13, /14 and /27, Has the -

old LIMITED been re-christened LILYRIC because of its new

‘ {nhabitants?.. When was it completed and are we still

withholding rent from LIMOUSINE in settlement of his

payment to us for-the property. The REAL Property Report shows
LILYRIC, MEXI 41, a5 having been leased in 1958 and

costing $1030-to maintain ($856 rent, $44 reparis, and $130.
utilities), It also shows MEXI 132 LIMEPTY, LIMOUSINE, LILYRIC
as having been rented in October 1966 for $2880 a yearg~
