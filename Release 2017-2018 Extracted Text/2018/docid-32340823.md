Informant was questioned as to why ROSELLI would have
control of him or any other Italians in Las Vegas and he stated
that ROSELLI was a very powerful man in the Las Vegas area and
handled a number of disputes between Italians in Las Vegas.

Informant also pointed out that had SPARACINO known or
xeported him to FRANK DESIMONE of Los Angeles, then the informant
would have had to go before DESIMONE to straighten out the argument

\ Informant was very reluctant to actually state that
subject's position was connected with the LCN but. implied ROSELLI
was an arbitrator for problems arising between two Italians. a

This information should be carefully paraphrased if
used in a report since it could be directly connected with the
informant if used in a report which is disseminated.

on 8/17/66, N¥ 5542-C-TE (an LCN member source) advised
SAs PAUL G. DURKIN and CHARLES G. DONNELLY that he recently ited
the Flamingo Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada. While in the Candlelight
‘Room at this hotel he observed a very dapper and distinguished ~
looking gentleman, who made a definite impression on the informant.
He made inquiries and determined he was JOHN ROSELLI from Los
Angeles.

It is to be noted at thie time he did not know ROSELLI
to be a member of LCN.

With regard to the gtatement that ROSELLI has either a
concession for entertainment or the gift concession at the Flamingo
Hotel, it is noted that the Log Angeles Office has no information
to substantiate this. It is recalled, however, that in 1957, when
the Tropicana Hotel was being built, ROSELLI purchased the gift
concesgion at that hotel for $5,000 which he gold back to the hotel
within a short period of time for $150,000.

On 10/14/66, LA 4448-c-TE advised that he had recently
received a telephone call from KAREN FLYNN, an acquaintance of hi
whom he had not seen for several years but who he had recalled had
dated JOHN MIRA six or seven years ago. MIRA's father owns the
Track, It is recalled that KAREN FLYNN has
been previously identified in thie investigation as a girl friend
of JOHN ROSELLI.

KAREN FLYNN told LA 4448-c-TE that several years ago
she loaned MIRA $1,000 which he never vepaid. She requested
informant to contact MIRA and attempt to obtain this money.

Informant telephonically contacted MIRA who acknowledged
that FLYNN had loaned him some money but he recalled that he had
repaid some of it and owed her not more than half the amount of
$1,000.
