24. (Confidential - DEM) LIAISON Called Bill Milleï, Staff

Director, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and set up a meeting

for him with @ric Isenstead®C/CCS, at 1l:00 a.rn. on 3 April to discuss

a story regarding Agency cover placements which may appear shortly

in the Chicago Sun Times.

I also asked Miller if there was any remaining assistance the

Agency could provide on the matter of a briefcase temporarily lost by

one member of the Committee staff and Miller said he thought not.

25. (Confidential - DEM) LIAISON Received a call from Stan

Taylor, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff, who referenced

one answer provided by the. Agency to the supplemental questions

submitted by the Committee regarding Agency activities in Micronesia.

Taylor thought that the documents referenced in this answer might help

in convincing the Committee to delete the most offensive sentence in the

interim report. I promised to bring the materials to Taylor the following

morning.

26. (Unclassified - GLC) LIAISON Steve Fallis, House Select

Committee on Assassinations staff, called in follow-up of his callin

Friday concerning yeeritelearatesand related matters. I told him

that Mr. Doug Cummins would be in touch with him today, after he

has talked with our Security people.

27. (Confidential - GLC) LIAISON Called Sam Hoskinson,

National Security Council staff, to check on the President's contacts

with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the Micronesia

statement. He confirmed that the President had talked with

Chairman Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii) on Friday afternoon and the

Chairman had indicated that the Committee would hold off any action

on the statement until Chairman Inouye returned to Washington and the

Committee meets on Tuesday. At that time, the matter will be brought

before the full Committee again. Hoskinson said the President was also

considering calling Senator Gary Hart (D., Colo.) on the matter.
