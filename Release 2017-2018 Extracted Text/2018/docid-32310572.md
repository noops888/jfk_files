In approximately

July, 1957, TONY was Introduced

to the subject who used the name SALLY BUPWS and GEORGE

LEVINE his partner by one JoE GENNA.

The subject and LEVINE

requested TONY to cooperate with them

in setting up a Ready-

Mi% Cement business in Havana, Cuba.

Their suggestion was

that TONY "front" the enterprise, which they indicated would

necessarily be successful due to political connections

which these individuals had in Havana.

This venture did

not ultimately materialize due to difficulties which arose

in obtaining a second hand ready-mis plant from the United

However, during the time plans were being made for

setting up this business, TONY made three trips to Cuba,

between July, 1957 and November 1, 1957.

TONY made each trip with GENN, and on one

occasion they conferred with GEORGE LEVINE, Who at that time

at the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo in Havana.

the first trip LEVINE took them to a proposed plant site and

assured them that they would have no difficulty obtaining

an option on this land or any problems during the setting up

stages of the plant due to his excellent connections in

the Cuban Government.

On the second trip LEVINE, GENNA,

and TONY arranged for corporation papers to be drawn up

In order that the business could be instituted when they

were able to obtain the necessary equipment in the United

LEVINE assured them that he and SALLY BURNS would

guarantee contracts from the Cuban Government which would

insure a profitaule operation.

They expected 50 percent

proceeds of the operation for

the use of their influence

in establishing this business.

However, as mentioned above,

the business never got into operation due to GENNA'S

difficulty in obtaining the correct equipment stemming from

a financial problem on GENNA's part.

si just

While in Havana on these three trips, TONY

accompanied LEVINE to various gambling casinos in Havana,

and to the Oriente Racetrack near Havana which LEVINE told

TONY he and BURNS owned.

TONY Indicated that the horse

races at the track did not seem to be set up with the idea

of a large profit being made on the racing end of the

business, Inasmuch as most of the races involved only a

$50.00 or $100.00 purse.

Instead, LEVINE Indicated that

they made their money from two gambling casinos, which they

operate at the track site.

During his visits to various

Havana casinos, TONY met a large number of Individuals who

appeared to be connected with these casinos and whom

LEVINE appeared to know very well.

LEVINE introduced TONY to an individual Identified

only as LEFTY CLARK, who was a pit boss in one of the

casinos.

(It 1s noted that this individual 1s probably

1dentical with WILLIAM EISCHOFF, aka., Lefty Clark, Miami

Top Hoodlum.) In addition to LEFTY CLARK, TONY met MEYER

LANSKY (New York Top Hoodlum) and SANTOS TPAFFICANTE

(Miam1 Top Hoodlum) who was Introduced as Mr. SANTOS.

On the last day of his most recent stay in Havana

with LEVINE, TONY and GENNA were walting downstairs at

the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo for LEVINE who planned to

leave for the United States with them by air.

When LEVINE

falled to appear in the hotel lobby after a considerable

walt, TONY left GENNA in the lobby

and went up to LEVINE's

hotel room to hurry him up.

TONY walked In without knocking

and LEVINE seemed quite upset about his coming Into the

room in this manner.

There were approximately six men

In the room besides LEVINE, one of whom TONY recognized as

the Individual previously introduced to him as Mr. SANTOS.

LEVINE referred to one of the men seated apart from the

others as

JOEY A. WaS JOE ADONIS,

well known New York hoodlum, who

was deported. to Italy,

in 1956.

Inasmuch as this ready -mix deal fell through,

TONY had no further dealings with SALLY BURNS until some

time In January, 1958, when he became in serious need of

In about January, 1958, TONY contacted BURNS

and received a $5,000.00

loan to be repaid in six months

with $1, 000.00 in Interest. $2,000.00 of this loan was

to be used as a deposit with the Telephone Company on a

number of telephones Installed at the Statewide Publishing

Company, Incorporated.

EUPNS stipulated that this deposit

with the Telsphone Company be placed in the name of JOE

QUAGLIARELLO, whom TONY came to know as both JOE QUELLI and

Little JOE, a close assoclate of BURNS.

In about February or March, 1958, BURNS contacted

TONY and

unexpectedly demanded that the $5,000.00 loan and

Interest be repaid Immediately. TONY told BURNS he did

not have the money at the time and would experience

difficulty In obtaining such a sum at the time.

became very insistent and threatened TONY with a beating

1f he did not repay the money immediately. During the

next month, TONY contacted close friends and from these

Individuals borrowed the $6,000.00 which was repaid to

EURI'S in about four installments.

After paying the balance

of the loan, EUrNS told TONY that he had decided that

74,000.00 Interest vias owed on the loan in addition to the

$1,000.00 already paid.

During the next three or four

months, TONY paid the additional $4,000.00 due to the

threats and pressure exerted by BUNS.

During the time he

was repaying the loan and interest to BURNS, TONY was

subjected to three beatings by BURNs and two

of his

musclemen identified only as BABE and CHICK.

Two of these

beatings took place in BURNS' apartment at 215 Mott Street,

and the other beating took place in an unmarked office

maintained by LEVINE and BURNS on the 20th floor at 40

Exchange Place, New York City. TONY had no choice but to

come to the instant address when requested to do so by

BURNS.

During the course of visits to BURNS' apartment

at Mott Street, TONY also became acquainted with a young

nuscleman referred to only as buddi, vino appeared to be

closely connected with BURNS. It is to be noted that

BUDDY may be Identical with EUDDY CAPPOLLA known to the

New York Office as being associated with the subject.)

During his visits to Mote Street, TONY often met BURNS and

his assochates in a small cafe located on the west side of

Mott Street near Kenmare Street, which seemed to be a

regular hangout for BURNS and his Inderlings. During various

visits to BURNS' apartment TONY observed VITO GENOVESE

(Newark. Top Hoodlum) in the apartment on one occasion

an Individual referred to as TONY BENDER (ANTHONY STROLLO

New York Top Hoodlum) on another occasion, and an

Individual referred to as JOHNNY BATHEEACH (JOHN ODDO, New

York Top Hoodlum) on another occasion.

On one occasion at a time when TONY had $1,000.00

to pay BURNS on the interest, BUIS clamed to be

accummulated, BURNS, during

a telephone call instructed

TONY to drop off the

$1, 000.00 with JOHNNY BATHEEACH at the

club thirteen at Avenue " and 13th Street, Brooklyn, New

when Toly appeared at the club Thirteen, ODDO
