It is noted that in 1953 and 1954 information
supplied by informants indicated the subject was a "front
man" for various labor unions and also that he was a
delegate in a TV repairmen'$.. union. The New York Office
to date has no corroborative information to substantite
these allegations. The New York Office, however, is
attempting to ascertain if the subject is, in fact,
connected with any unions at present and if so, in what
capacity.

In approximately July, 1957, TONY was introduced
to the subject who used the name SALLY BURNS and GEORGE
LEVINE his partner by one JOE GENNA. The subject and LEVINE
requested TONY to cooperate with them in setting up a Ready-
Mix Cement business in Havana, Cuba. Their suggestion was
that TONY "front" the enterprise, which they indicated would
necessarily be successful due to political connections
which these individuals had in Havana. This venture did
not ultimately materialize due to difficulties which arose
in obtaining a second hand ready-mix plant from the United
States. However, during the time plans were being made for
setting up this business, TONY made three trips to Cuba,
between July, 1957 and November 1, 1957.

TONY made each trip with GENNA, and on one
occasion they conferred with GEORGE LEVINE, who at that time
resided at the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo in Havana. On
the first trip LEVINE took them to a proposed plant site and
assured them that they would have no difficulty obtaining
an option on this land or any problems during the setting up
stages of the plant due to his excellent connections in
the Cuban Government. On the second trip LEVINE, GENNA,
and TONY arranged for corporation papers to be drawn up
in order that the ousiness could be instituted when they
were able to obtain the necessary equipment in the United

tates, LEVINE assured them that he and SALLY BURNS would
@uerantee contracts from the Cuban Government which would
insure @ profitable operation. They expected 50 percent
proceeds of the operation for the use of their influence

in establishing this business. However, as mentioned above,
the business never got into operation due to GENNA'S
Gifficulty in obteining the correct equipment stemming from
a financlal problem on GENNA'sS part.

DocId:32310572 Page 15



NY 92-1108

While in Havana on these three trips, TONY
accompanied LEVINE to various Gambling casinos in Havana, 7
and to the Oriente Racetrack near Havana which LEVINE told
TONY he and BURNS owned. TONY indicated that the horse
races at the track did not seem to be set up with the idea
of a large profit being made on the racing end of the
business, inasmuch as most of the races involved only a
$50.00 or $100.00 purse. Instead, LEVINE indicated that
they made their money from two gambling casinos, which they
operate at the track site. During his visits to various
Havane casinos, TONY met a large number of individuals who
appeared to be connected with these casinos and whom
LEVINE appeared to know very well.

LEVINE introduced TONY to an individual identified
only as LEFTY CLARK, who was a pit boss in one of the
casinos. (It is noted that this individual is probably
identical with WILLIAM EISCHOFF, aka., Lefty Clark, Miami
Top Hoodlum.) In addition to LEFTY CLARK, TONY met MEYER
LANSKY (New York Top Hoodlum) and SANTOS TRAFFICANTE
(Miami Top Hoodlum) who was introduced as Mr. SANTOS.

ons On the last day of his most recent stay in Havana
with LEVINE, TONY and G A were waiting downstairs at

the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo for LEVINE who planned to
leave for the United States with them by air. When LEVINE
failed to appear in the hotel lobby after a considerable
wait, TONY left GENNA in the lobby and went up to LEVINE's °
hotel room to hurry him up. TONY walked in without knocking
and LEVINE seemed quite upset about his coming into the
room in this manner. There were approximately six men

in the room besides LEVINE, one of whom TONY recognized as
the individual previously introduced to him as Mr. SANTOS.
LEVINE referred to one of the men Seated apart from the
others as "JOZY A,*

DocId:32310572 Page 16


NY 92-1108

see T-2 advised that the individual referred to as
JOEY A. was JOE ONIS, well known New York hoodlum, who
was deported. to Italy, in 1956,

Inasmuch as this ready-mix deal fell through,
TONY had no further dealings with SALLY EURNS until some
time in January, 1958, when he became in serious need of
monty. In about January, 1958, TONY contacted BURNS
and received a $5,000.00 loan to be repaid in six months
with $1,000.00 in interest, $2,000.00 of this loan was
to be used as a deposit with the Telephone Company on a
number of telephones installed at the Statewide Publishing
Company, Incorporated. BURNS stipulated that this deposit
with the Telephone Company be Placed in the name of JOE
QUAGLIARELLO, whom TONY came to know és both JOE QUELLI and
Little JOE, a close associate of BURNS.

In about February or March, 1958, BURNS contacted
TONY and unexpectedly demanded that the $5,000.00 loan and
interest be repaid imuediately. TONY told BURNS he did
not have the money at the time and would experience
difficulty in obtaining such 2 sum at the time. BURNS
became very insistent and threatened TONY with a beating
if he did not repay the money ii lately. During the
7 month, TONY contacted close friends and from these
viduels borrowed the $6,000.00 which was repaid to
EURNS in about four installments. After paying the balance
of tne loan, EURNS told TONY that he had decided that
$4,000.00 interest was owed on the loan in addition to the
$1,090.00 already paid. During the next three or four
months, TONY paid the additional $4,000.00 due to the
threats and pressure exerted by EURNS. During the time he
was repaying the loan end interest to BURNS, TONY was
Subjected to three beatings by BURNS and two of his

a

DocId: 32310572 Page 17


NY 92-1108

musclemen identified only as BABE and CHICK. Two of these
beatings took place in BURNS' apartment at 215 Mott Street,
and the other beating took place in an unmarked office
maintained by LEVINE and BURNS on the 20th floor at 40
Exchange Place, New York City. TONY had no choice but to
come to the instant address when requested to do so by
BURNS.

During the course. of visits to BURNS' apartment

“at Mot’ treet, TONY also became acquainted with a young

muscleman referred to only as EUDDY, who appeared to be
closely connected with BURNS. (It is to be noted that
EUDDY may be identical with EUDDY CAPPOLLA known to the
New York Office as being associated with the subject.)
During his visits to Mott Street, TONY often met EURNS and
his associates in a small cafe located on the west side of
Mott Street near Kenmare Street, which seemed to be a
regular hangout for EURNS and his underlings. During various
visits to BURNS' apartment TONY observed VITO GENOVESE
(Newark Top Hoodlum) in the apartment on one occasion

an individual referred to as TONY BENDER (ANTHONY STROLLO
New York Top Hoodlum) on another occasion, and an
individual referred to as JOHNNY BATHEEACH (JOHN ODDO, New
York Top Hoodlum) on another occasion. ;

On one occasion at a time when TONY had $1,000.00
to pay BURNS on the interest, EURNS cldmed to be
accummulated, EURNS, during a telephone call instructed
TONY to drop off the $1,000.00 with JOHNNY BATHBEACH at the
Club Thirteen at Avenue U arid 13th Street, Brooklyn, New
York. When TONY appeared at the Club Thirteen, ODDO
introduced him to an individual referred to only as MINX
or MINXIE (JOE LIVOTO close associate of JOHN ODDO). ODDO
then left the club alone with TONY and directed him to a

DocId:32310572 Page 18


NY 92-1108

ANTHONY STROLLO and as the behind .-the-scene owner of
Tony Pastor's Night Club.

A short time after TONY had completed his
payments to SALLY BURNS, aggrégating $10,000.00, he was
contacted by BURNS and instructed to come to BURNS!
apartment on a business matter, Upon arrival at his
apartment BURNS explained to him that he was taking over an
interest in a New York night.club, the Cafe de Paris at
53rd Street and Broadway, New York City, a club featuring
a big name entertainment policy. It was explained that
LOU WALTERS, well known New York City night club impresario,
was in a financial jam in this club which he had opened,
and BURNS told TONY that he, TONY, was to assume the duties
as "front man" in the club. When TONY complained to BURNS
that he had no particular interest in entering such a
venture, EPURNS reportedly instructed him in no uncertain ‘
terms that he was to take the job and that he had no choice
in the matter. In view of the physical violence inflected
on TONY during previous contacts with BURNS and his group,
TONY saw no alternative but to follow BURNS' instructions.
He served as manager at this club for about four or five
weeks until the club folded and went into bankruptcy.
During this period, SALLY BURNS contributed a total of
about $13,000.00 to the operation of the club and he,

TONY, personally contributed close to $30,000.00 which he
had been able to borrow from close friends.

While the club was in operation BURNS gave the
indication that the $13,000.00 BURNS contributed was as
an investment in this vanture. However, when the club went
into bankruptcy, EURNS informed TONY that he was responsible
for the $13,000.00 as a personal loan from BURNS. BORNS .
therefore once again began demands on TONY not only for the
principal $13,000.00, but for exhorbitant interest on

DocId:32310572 Page 19


NY 92-1108

this "loan" which to date amounts to a total of
approximately $16,000.00.

Though BURNS took no active part in managing
this club he was often there during the evening hours as
were some of his underlings, specifically the individuals
referred to previously as BABE, CHICK, and BUDDY.

Part of the $13,000.00 contributed by BURNS was,
according to TONY raised in the following manner:

At a particular time when TONY was having
difficulty makt the payroll, EURNS instructed him to
eccompany JOE QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey, where they were
