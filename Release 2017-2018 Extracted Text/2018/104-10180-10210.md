so insure the most eflective application of nonofficial cover, it

ssential that cover requirements be brought to the attention of Centr

Cover Staff in the earliest stages of planning.

As soon as it has been

determined that an agent is to be placed under nonomicial cover, eithe

in the

United States or abroad, a meeting with a representative o

Central Cover Staff should be arranged. (When outside recruitment of

an agent for a nonofficial cover assignment is contemplated, Central

Cover Staff facilities are avallable to facilitate "clean" recruitments and

protect the agent against identification with CIA during the integration

period.) Initial discussions will be informal and exploratory and should

is result in the elimination of unsuitable cover possibilities. Central Cover

Staff, Nonomicial Cover Branch telephone extensions are 5144 and 5122.

Following the initial discussion, and based upon it, a cover require

ment memorandum signed by or for the operating division chief should

be submitted to Central Cover Staff. It is specifically requested that a

headquarters case officer other than the agent himself be designated

to deal with Central Cover Staff in the development of the desired non-

official cover, including the preparation of the cover requirement mem-

orandum, in order that this development may proced on a completely

objective basis.

This memorandum may be keyed to the paragraphs

numbered. below to obviate repetition.

No commitments will be made with any cover organization until

Central Cover Staff has been advised by memorandum that the proposed

cover and the agent's participation in the operation have been concurred

in by the field and/or the Chief of Operations, DD/P. Such memoranda

are to be signed by or for the division chief.

Each agent proposed for

a nonomicial cover assignment is subject also to personal interview by a

designee of Chief, Central Cover Staff, for assessment as to his sult-

ability for the proposed cover.

This interview, when required, will be

requested by Central Cover Staff.

At the conclusion of the discussions with the operating divisions and

discussions between representatives of Central Cover Staff and the cover

organization, two formal documents ordinarily will be prepared:

a. The first, a "Letter of Cover Instructions" addressed to the agent

will be prepared by the Central Cover Staff. It will outline exactly

the cover story to be employed and will specify what is expected

of the agent to maintain a proper relationship to the cover la-

cility

Each item in the instructions will be discussed with the

agent and/or his case oficer by the Central Cover Staff case officer,

alter which the agent will be required to acknow'edge the receipt

of these instructions.

Renewal of Robert S. HUNKELER Contract

Action Required: As Indicated

The present contract with Robert S. HUNKELER expires on 31

March 1967 and the question of renewal is up for immediate treatment

and decision.

The paragraphs below outline the major factors to be

considered in this matter.

HUNKELER 1s a

former staff officer who resigned from WOrACI

in 1964 to establish a market research and marketing firm. He was

recontacted in the spring of 1965 and employed as an independent con-

tracter by the then COS, JNWAVE,

who expressed the hope that this

relationship might set a standard for use by WOFACT of former staff

officers as long tern clandestine assets and outlined HUNKELER's duties

and responsibilities as follows:

a. To provide cover for WOFACT personnel abroad.

Spotter and assessor of Central American consular

community in Niami.

Spotter and assessor of recruitment targets throughou

atin and Central America as developed through bis travels and contacts.

Third party recruiter and agent handler, but only in

certain carefully controlled circunstances.

These original concepts framing HUNKELER's activities have

continued as the major guide lines

to his employment.

Also added was

task of reporting such positive and operational intelligence as he

might elicit from his contacts and associates..

There has been no other use by WOFACT of this HUNKELER potential during

the past two jears." Such use in the future is an open question depend

ing in part on whether WOFACT has a requirement for cover facilities

such as this, and in part on the nature of our relationship with HUNKELEF.

HUNKELER has met frequently with members of the Central

and Latin

American consular community in the Miami area.

These assOC-

several international organizations concerned with business and social

but the Station has found it more advantageous and otticient to use

inside personnel for this.

It is highly unlikely that station policy

will change in this regard.

HUNKELER has boon on several business trips during this period.

On these occasions he was given an intelligence brief and his operation

al expenses were defrayed by WOFACT.

The results, in terms of dissemin=

ated reports, have generally beon negative.

HUNKELER provided an introduction to some individuals

who have a potential for use fr

the MILYION program.

There was some

discussion of continued activity for HUNKELER in this program, but 1t

was the consensus that there was not sufficient promise

SUBJECT:

Operational Review of Robert S. Hunkeler

DATE:

16 February 1967

Background:

Shortly after Hunkeler resigned from KUBARK he

met with the then Chief of Station on several occasions

concerning Hunkelers potential use as a Station asset.

It was between the period following his resignation, and

before his first contract with the Station, that the COs

told Hunkeler that he was in a "cooling off period" during

which time Hunkeler should devote his energies towards the

settlement of his personal affairgand the development of

his own business interests. Hunkeler was also told that

his value to the Station and to KUBARK would be increased

18 he were free from all ties with KUBARK and ODYOKE In

order that Hunkeler may be available at a later date for

KUBARK assignments. The COS did not, however, make any

commitments to dunkelere

Developments:

2.

During the months which followed Hunkelers resignation

he proceeded to attend to his personal affairs in Lakeland,

Plorida, and

established his company, Identity A, in the

WAVE area.

## Page 50

= 2 -

After a number of months had lapsed, Hunkeler

was contacted by the Station COS and was recruited under

& contract in the amount of $500.00 a month plus operational

expenses. Hunkeler expressed a willingness

to undertake

any assignment and a desire to actively participate in

operations. (His initial target was largely limited to

the monitoring of the activities and the personalities of

the foreign consular corp in the VAVE area and reporting

on matters of operational interest ae they came to Hunkelers

attention.)

4..

Shortly after Hunkeler was placed under contract

he submitted a paper to the Station which spelled out a

number of specific tasks which he could, under the cover

of his company if required, undertake for the Station

or KUBARK. (There aboignments are ot111 comptablo with.

to prevent cover and baokground. There follows a list

of these tasks;

(a) Sale of KURIOT doctored parts and supplies

to the government of PBRUMEN through middlemen

and in a manner as to not disclose Hunkelers

Involvement.

(b)

Providing non-official cover

facilities

to persons being assigned overseas

and who require

tight, realistic and flexible cover.

activities in the vAVE area.

(e) Reporting on targets of operational

Interest, both in the wAVE ares and in those

countries here Hunkeler visits.

(1) Spotting and assessment of specific operational

targets in the PEPRIME and in Latin America.

Review of Accomplishments:

5.

Whereas Hunkeler remained ready and willing to

trevel anywhere at anytime for any KUBARk assignment, he

was advised that his long range value would be jeopardized

1f he sere to take operational assignments involving any

degree of risk. Hunkeler was, in his opinion, "kept in a

vacuum" as regards his being able to serve field Stations

which have not to this date been made aware of his availability

to travel except in those cases when his business travel takes

to a country and the field Station is advised of his presence

in the area.

6.

From the outset Hunkeler began to report on develop

ments in

the wAVE area and he bagan to work in organizations

which would pernit him to penetrate the diplomatic community

and strengthen his operational capabilities in terms of

being able to spot and aßgess Latin American political

leaders. Hunkeler got him-self appointed to a policy

making position in the Identity B, he was elected to

the position of President of Identity C, appointed to

the Board of Directors of Identity D, was elected to

the position of President of Identity E, and became a

delegate to several conferences (Panama, Jamaica and

1n PBPRINE) of the Identity F.

It was largely as a result of Hunkelers Latin

American oriented commercial activities and his organizational

activities that he uns sble to provide tirely and valuable

reports on the Dominican crisis, estatlish a personal

relationship with Identity & and persons close to him,

spot and access several Fanamanian targets, and report

on the activities and recommendations of Identity H, an

organization which provides concercial policy to the President

of Panama. (See

Hunkeler kept the Station

up to date

on the personalities and

activities of the Consular

Corp in the WiVE area, and has furnished assessments and

blographic

information on l2 members of this group.

Other accomplishments include the followirg;

(a) Overstional recorting: During the last two

years Hunkeler has traveled to and submitted

operational and/or intel reports about lexico,

the Dominican Repablic, Haiti, Jamaica, Venezuela,

Panama and Costa Rica, in addition to reports

originating in the WAVE area.

(b) Establishment of Cover Facilities: In 1966

Hunkeler set up and maintained cover facilities

for an agent who was initially trained in Hunkelers

companies and subsequently assigned to a European

post where he remained until a personill reduction

cut caused his termination. The cover aspects of

this cover operation, however, were tight and

professionally maged by Hunkeler. Other cover

facilities developed by Hunkeler in this period

included a cover office facility in Haiti, Venezuela

and the Dominican Republic.

(c)

Other: In late 1966 Hunkeler met with an Officer

assigned to the WAVE Station for the purpose of

reviewing the operational potentiais of the "aribbean.

Hunkeler was able to provide the Officer with the

names and introductions to persons well known to

lunkeler who are now in the Caribbean or residing

in liani and available to participate in gent, poa.,

or informant capacities.

The success

of Hunkelers commercial activities in the Dominican Republic

(and the corresponding move by Hunkeler to open an office

in Santo Domingo) is a recent development and there has not

yet been time to query

as to whether or

not they have a requirement to use Hunkelers facilities.

(Hunkeler is presently phasing

out of much organizational

work in the WAVE area in order to devote more time to the

chore

of setting up his operations

in Santo Domingo and

Venezuela where both of his companies

are currently doing

business.)

10•

There are

several aspects of Hunkelers present business

activities which have not yet been finalized: He will soon

terminate his lease at his present address and has not yet

decided where to re-locate lis offces; he is still in

negotiations with an investnent group in Haiti and may

When lunkelers contract was about to expire in

February, 1966, he met with & Station Officer and advised

that he was fully in accord with a salary cut from $500.00

to $300.00 a month in keeping with budgetary cuts which

were evident at that time. Moreover, Hunkeler voluntertly

ceased requesting reimbursement for operational expenses

choosing to use his KUBARk income for entertaintent expenses

which oftimes have operational value to KUBARK. Although he

has expressed his strong desire to continue his KUBARK

relationship under a renewal of his present contract for

$300.00 a month, he has advised that he does not care to

renew his contract for a figure of less than $300.00 a month.
