|sieaeT

1. The cover for Peter J. Pi Gerveno was discussed by Robert S-
Hunkeler, Chester BR. Dagnillo and the undersigned on 7 and 9 November
1967, The purpose of the conversations was to determine the most
suitable cover to be used under the broad umbrella offered by
Runkeler's various enterprises.

2. The following conclusions were reached:

a. That Di Gerveno will come (Jas the
representative for some of lunkeler's sales lines.
Specifically he will he the representative for IDENTITY-1,
which is Hunkeler's marketing firm,

b. In addition to representing IDENTITY-1, generally,
he will specifically be IDENTITY-I's sales agent for IDESTITY-2;
IDENTITY-3; and IDENTITY=-4 and possibly for IDUNTITY-5.

3. IDENTITY-2 is the manufacturer of a wide variety of
industrial epoxy products used in the construction industry and

NONOFFICIAL COVER REQUEST
FOR INDIVIDUAL

To insure the most effective application of nonofficial cover, it is
essential that cover requirements be brought to the attention of Central
Cover Staff in the earliest stages of planning. As soon as it has been
determined that an agent is to be placed under nonofficial cover, either
In the United States or abroad, a mecting with a representative of
Central Cover Staff should be arranged. (When outside recruitment of
an agent for a nonofficial cover assignment is contemplated, Central
Cover Staff facilities are available to facilitate “clean” recruitments and
protect the agent against identification with CIA during the integration
period.) Initial discussions will be informal and exploratory and should

iz «;Fesult in the elimination of unsuitable cover possibilities. Central Cover

“Staff, Nonofficial Cover Branch telephone extensions are 5144 and 5122.

Following the initial discussion, and based upon it, a cover require-
ment memorandum signed by or for the operating division chief should
be submitted to Central Cover Staff. It Is specifically requested that a
headquarters case officer other than the agent himself be designated
to deal. with Central Cover Staff in the development of the desired non-
official cover, including the preparation of the cover requirement mem-
orandum, in order that this development may procced on a completely
objective basis, This memorandum may be keyed to the paragraphs
numbered-below to obviate repetition,

No commitments will be made with any cover organization ‘until
Central Cover Staff has been advised by memorandum that the proposed
cover and the agent's participation in the operation have been concurred
in by the field and/or the Chief of Operations, DD,P. Such memoranda
are to be signed by or for the division chief. Each agent proposed for
a nonofficial cover assignment is subject also to personal interview by a
designee of Chief, Central Cover Staff, for assessment as to his sult-
ability for the proposed cover. This interview, when required, will be
requested by Central Cover Staff.

At the conclusion of the discussions with the operating divisions and
discussions between representatives of Central Cover Staff and the cover
organization, two formal documents ordinarily will be prepared:

a, The first, a “Letter of Cover Instructions” addressed to the agent
will be prepared by the Central Cover Staff. It will outline exactly
the cover story to be employed and will specify what is expected
of the agent to maintain a proper relationship to the cover fa-
cility. Each item in the instructions will be discussed with the
agent and/or his case officer by the Central Cover Statf case officer,
after which the agent will be required to acknow‘edge the receipt
of these instructions, The branch chief concerned will also be

who will accompany agent overseas. Are spouse and adult de-
pendents knowledgeable of agent's CIA connection? His Govern-
ment connection? Has agent been polygraphed?

». OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
1. Type of Operation - so.

The general type of operation involved, Le., CA, FI, COMMO,
Logistics, etc., and the expected duration of assignment. The
sensitivity of the operation should be indicated—é.g., observation,
spotting and reporting only; case officer for established agents;

SECRET

recruitment of new agents; penctration operation—and a state-
ment should be included as to the identities of any individuals
and organizations, in the U.S. or abroad (other than CIA stafl
personnel, cover facility officials, and those lsted under 2(C)
44) above), who are or will be made witting of agent's CIA or
U.S. Government affiliation while he is under this nonoflicial cover.

. Location

The city in which the agent is to reside should be spectficaily
stated and alternates in order of preference should be given

. Indicate localities outside of agent’s permanent: location witch

agent should be free to visit and state the frequency and duration
of such visits. Also it is important to know whether or not the
time and intervals of such mectings will be determined by the

agent or dictated by influences or circumstances beyond his con-
trol. .

. Special groups agent should be able to contact

It is sometimes possible to relate a cover to a particular group
in the operatior.al area, Le., social, cultural, political, commerciai.
If this is considered an important factor in the cover, this aspect
of the requirement should be explained in detail.

Approximate annual income which agent must be able w at-
tribute to the cover organization. Sound cover, of course, re-
quires overt (cover) explanation for a reasonable approximation
of the sum actually to be available to the agent through Agency
salary and allowances. However, a professional intclilgence
agent's qualifications frequently cannot plausibly command an
ostensible income from commercial or other lay sources nearly
approaching his Agency income. Firm understanding should be
had relative to the agent's living within his cover income.  Reser-
vation of a portion of his Agency remuneration may be required
A less desirable alternative is the provision of additional cover
for income.

. Estimate of the minimum number of hours per weck which the

agent must devote to operational duties.

. Communications channels desired

In rare instances it may be possible to set up SW means of com-
munication through the cover facility. If this Is desired, the

justification and frequency of such communication facilities
Should be indicated.

. Cover Suggestions

Any specific cover suggestion or preferences expressed either
by the agent or the operating division emphasizing the agent’s
special suitability to the cover suggested and.‘or the special ad-
vantages of the cover vis-a-vis the target.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/3 “=
FROM 3 Chief, WH/3/

SUBJECT : Assignment of

1. I wish to make it clear that I do not oppose

_the assignment of| jper se to but I
do have some reservations on what he is going to be
doing. OS,| intends to use him as the case
officer for the CIHAVOC and CITILT Projects. Since both

are basically CE/CI projects I think this is a great
mistake. The amount of research in these projects
necessarily requires a great amount of files research
which in his cover situation will not be
able to do. $ Will entail a greater amount of work
for the inside case officer, defeating the purpose for
whichL______] was originally considered; freeing the
inside case officer for developmental work.

2. The intoduction of into the CIHAVOC
Case will also intoduce one more step through which most
of the vital information that CIHAVOC-2 produces must
pass. For example, his info now goes through CIHAVOC-1
to the case officer. With the addition of|
one more time consuming step will be added.

3. I am also of the firm opinion that different
case officers should be used for these operations
since both are penetrations of the same party and at
times produce similar info. In addition, both are
extremely sensitive and.the compromise of one could
possibly lead to the compromise of the other.

4, If was assigned to for the
handling of a sensitive case which exposure would be
embarrassing to the United States, such as a high level
political penetration or a sensitive Soviet/Satellite
Case then it would be well justified. However, I feel
that his assignment as an outside case officer for
these two activities is not since they could be better

handled and serviced from the inside.

tracter by the then COS, JMWAVE, who expressed the hope that this

relationship might set a standard for use by WOFACT of former staff
officers as long term clandestine assets and outlined HUNKELER's duties

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

4, The following summarizes the progress that was made in these
areas during the two year period of Hi KELER's contract status with us.

a, Cover was provided for a Berlin based agent, ANTHRILL/1,
Although the agent was terminated by Berlin Station, management of iis
cover was competently and professionally handled by HUNKELER, HUNKELER
has continued to offer his services to WOFACT in this respect and,
although he could provide a cover officg anywhere in the Latin American
sphere, has specifically suggested Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Costa
Rica and Venezuela, He is now in the process of opening, on his own
initiative, branch offices in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic and
again nountscred them for possible use as cover, According to HUNKELER.
Station has shown some interest in taking advantage of the offer
There has been no other use by WOFACT of this HUNKELER potential during
: ~ Such use in the future is an open question depend=
ing in part on whether WOFACT has a-requirement for cover facilities
such as this, and “in part on ‘the nature of our relationship with HUNKE!

b, HUNKELER hag met frequently with members of the Central
and Latin American consulur community in’ the Miami area, These assoc-
dations were enhanced by HUNKELER's activity and participation in
several international organizations concerned with business and social
relations among Latin and North American countries, Some operational
information was gathered about these persons, but none of them ever
shaped up as a valid’ intelligence target worthy of further development
and recruitment, It is not expected that this target area will be of
any more interest in the future than it is now,

£-  TUNKELER has a large number of business associates through:
out tatin America and in his travels has contacted a number of governmen
-pfficials up to the presidential level, Most of these contacts have
been of a business nati One of them, a Panamanian legislator, is of
Some interest to the(___"\Station, Interest in the others has’ been
minimal, Future prospects remain open, but must be considered as long

range,

d, There has been no use made of HUNKELER as a third party
recruiter and agent handler during his.two year tenure, He has de-
clared himself always ready and willing to take on agent handling tasks,
but the Station has found it more advantageous and efficient to use
inside personnel for this, It is highly unlikely that station policy
will change in this regard, .

4, HUNKELER has been on several business trips during this period,
On these occasions he was given an intelligence brief and his operation-—
al expenses were defrayed by WOFACT, The results, in terms of disseminej +
ated reports, have wenerally been negative,

5. | Recently, HUNKELER provided an introduction to some individuals
who have a potential for use in the JMUNION program, There was some
discussion of continued activity for HUNKELER in this program, but it
was the consensus that there was not sufficient promise in hig contri-
bution to merit retaining him for this purpose alone, It can ba ex
Pected, hewever, that he might, in the future, assist in entree to
other persons of JMUNION interest,

6. Station JMWAVE is of the opinion that employment of Robert S.
HUNKELER bay not had tho results that were hoped for when the contract-
ual relationship was first established, Recognition of this was implici
in the renegotiation of his salary scale from $4800 to $3600 per annum
in March 1966 at the end of his first year's contract, It is also the
opinion of this Station that there ts little likelihood of improvement
in the hear future althouxh it is recognized that a long range potential
exists, These statements are made without prejudice to Robert S,
NUNKELER, who has at all] times taken a responsible, willing and coop-
erative attitude in his relationships with Station representatives. and
discussions of tasks and tho prospects of future employment, It should
be noted that HUNKELER wants: very much to retain some torn of relation-
ship with the organization, as much for reasoris of interest in the
intolligonce profession ax for income he might derive,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Operational Review of Robert S, Hunkeler
DATEs 16 “ebruary 1967 _
Backgrounds

1 Shortly after Hunkeler resigned from KUBARK he _

met with the then Chief of Station on several occasions
concerning Hunkelers potential use as a Station asset.

It was between the period following his resignation, and
before his first contract with the Station, that the COS
told Hunkeler that he wasin a "cooling off period" during
which time Hunkeler should devote his energies towards the
settlement of his personal affairgand the development of
his own business interests, Hunkeler was also told that
his value to the Station and to KUBARK would be increased
if he were free from all ties with KUBARK and ODYOKE in
order that Hunkeler may be available at a later date for
KUBARK assignments, The COS did not, however, make any

commitments to Hunkelere

Developments:
2. During the months which followed Hunkelers resignation

he proceeded to attend to his personal affairs in Lakeland,
Plorida, and established his company, Identity A, in the

WAVE area.


3. After a number of months had lapsed, Hunkeler

was contacted by the Station COS and was recruited under |
@ contract in the amount of $500.00 a month plus operational
expenses. Hunkeler expressed a willingness to undertake
any assignment and a desire to actively participate in
operations. (His initial target was largely limited to \
the monitoring of the activities and the personalities of
the foreign consular corp in the WAVE area and reporting

on matters of operational interest as they came to Hunkelers .
|

attention.)

: !
4e Shortly after Hunkeler was placed under contract’
he submitted a paper to the Station which spelled out a
number of specific tasks which he could, under the cover i

of his company if required, undertake for the Station
or KUBARK, (Shese—essignnents—are—otili—eomptable with
-hie—present—cover_and—backgrounds) There follows a List

of these tasks;
(a) Sale of KURIOT doctored parts and supplies

to the government of PBRUMEN through middlemen
and in a manner as to not disclose Hunkelers
involvement.

(bv) Providing non-official cover facilities

to persons being assigned overseas and who require

a tight, realistic and flexible cover.


-3-

(c) Recruitment pitches, courier work, or

related assignaents anywhere in Latin America.

(a) Monitoring of diplomatic and commercial

activities in the WAVE area. :

(e) Reporting on targets of operational

interest, both in the WAVE area and in those

countries here Hunkeler visits.

(f) Spotting and assessment of specific operational
7

targets in the PBPRIME and in Latin America.

Review of Accomplishments:

5. Whereas Hunkeler remained ready and willing to
travel anyv-here at anytime for any KUBARK assignment, he

was advised that his long range value would be jeopardized

if he were to take operational assignments involving any
degree of risk. Hunkeler was, in his opinion, "kept ina
vacuum" as regards his being able to serve ficld Stations
which have not to this date been made aware of his availability
to travel except in those cases when his business travel takes

to a country and the field Station is advised of his presence

in the area.

6. From the outset Hunkeler began to report on develop~
ments in the AVS area and he bagan to work in organizations

which would permit him to penetrate the diplomatic community


and strengthen his operational capabilities in terms of
being able to spot and aggess Latin American political :
leaderse Hunkeler got him-self appointed to a policy
making position in the Identity B, he was elected to
the position of President of Identity C, appointed to
the Board of Directors of Identity D, was elected to
the position of President of Identity E, and became a
delegate to several conferences (Panama, Jamaica and

in PBPRIME) of the Identity F.

1 It was largely as a result of Hunkelers Latin
American oriented commercial activities and his organizational
activities that he was able to provide timely and valuable
reports on the Dominican crisis, estatlish a personal
relationship with Identity G and persons close to him,

spot and access several Fanamanian targets, and report

on the activities and recommendations of Identity H, an
organization which provides commercial policy to the President

of Panama.(See ) Hunkeler kept the Station

up to date on the personalities and activities of the Consular
Corp in the WAVE area, and has furnished assessments and

biographic information on 12 members of this group.


-5-

Other accomplishments include the following;

(a) Operational secorting: During the last two
years Hunkeler has traveled to and submitted
operational and/or intel reports about Mexico,
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Venezuela,
Panama and Costa fica, in addition to reports

originating in the WAVE area.

(bo) Establishment of Cover Facilities: In 1966

Hunkeler set up and maintained cover facilities
for an agent who was initially trained in Hunkelers
companies and subsequently assigned to a European :
pest where he remained until a person¥2l reduction

eut caused his termination, The cover aspects of 1
this cover operation, however, were tight and

professionally mmaged by Hunkeler, Other cover

facilities developed by Hunkeler in this period

included a cover office facility in Haiti, Venezuela

and the Dominican Republics

(c) Other: In late 1966 Hunkeler met with an Officer

dasigned to the WAVE Station for the purpose of
reviewing the operational potentiais of the “aribbeans
Hunkeler was able to provide the Officer with the
names and introductions to persons well known to
Hunkeler who are now in the Caribbean or residing

in Miami and available to participate in went, p.Be,

or informant capacitiess


Present Situation:
oe In early February, 1966, Hunkeler met with a “ase

Officer who reviewed Hunkelers existing

business activities in and who told Hunkeler that

the desired to use a Hunkeler company for

non-official cover purposes in The success

of Hunkelers commercial activities in the Dominican Republic
(and the corresponding move by Hunkeler to open an office

in Santo Domingo) is a recent development and there has not

as to whether or

yet been time to query

not they have a requirement to use Hunkelers facilitiess
(Hunkeler is presently phasing out of much organizational
work in the WAVE area in order to devote more time.to the
chore of setting up his operations in Santo Domingo and

Venezuela where both of his companies are currently doing

business.)

106 There are several aspects of Hunkelers present business
activities which have not yet been finalized: He win soon
terminate his lease at his present ‘address and has not yet
decided where to re-locate !:is offres; he is still in
negotiations with an investment group in Haiti and may

undertake a consultant type survey there which would provide

access to Haiti of possible interest to


Future Potentials:
ile When Hunkelers contract was about to expire in
February, 1966, he met with a Station Officer and advised
that he was fully in accord with a salary cut from $500.00
to $300.00 a month in keeping with budgetary cuts which

were evident at that time. Moreover, Hunkeler volunterily
ceased requesting reinbursenent Sor operational expenses
choosing to use his KUBARK income for entertainment expenses
which oftines have operational value to KUBARK, Although he
has expressed his strong desire to continue his KUBARK
relationship under a renewal of his present contract for
$300.00 a month, he has advised that he does not care to

renew his contract for a figure of less than $300.00 a month.
