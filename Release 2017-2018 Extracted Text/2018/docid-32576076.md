Re Phila. airtel to Bureau 8/4/64 and form FD
142 dated 8/4/64,

PH 705-C* activated 11:02 a.m., 8/7/64.

on 8/6/64 SAs J. ROBERT PEARCE and JOSEPH A.
VERICA made installation at 1531 S. Broad Street, Phila.,
first floor, under pretext of telephone men. Installation
checked successfully but7technical difficulties encountered
in routing to CP over leased line. This situation remedied
8/7/64 and source appears to have excellent quality.

For record purposes, outside coverage during
installation was afforded by SAs DAVID W. BREEN, ROBERT W.
HOLMES and EDWARD D. HEGARTY.

and altered telephone "Jack" was used in this installatio

There was no breach of security during trespass
n
which affords excellent security. es

Bureau will be kept advised of the developments
of this source.
