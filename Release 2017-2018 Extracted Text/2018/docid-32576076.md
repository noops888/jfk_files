Re Phila. airtel to Bureau 8/4/64 and form FD

142 dated 8/4/64.

PH 705-C* activated 11:02 a.m., 8/7/64.

On 8/6/64 SAS J. ROBERT PEARCE and JOSEPH A.

VERICA made installation at 1531 S. Broad Street, Phila.,

first floor, under pretext of telephone men.

Installation

checked successfully but technical difficulties encountered

in routing to CP over leased line. This situation remedied

8/7/64 and source appears to have

excellent quality.

For record purposes, outside coverage during

installation was afforded by SAs DAVID W. BREEN, ROBERT W.

HOLMES and EDWARD D. HEGARTY.

There was no

breach of security during trespass

and altered telephone

"jack" was used in this installation

which affords excellent security.

Bureau will be kept advised of the developments

of this source.
