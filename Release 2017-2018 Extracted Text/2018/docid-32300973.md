p, LCN INFLUENCE IN

It has been previously reported that in January of
1965, STEVE MAGADDINO mentioned that he had “been in
Canada for 45 years" and specifically named Montreal as a
location where he had considerable influence.

investigation has developed that the COTRONI
Brothers have controlled or played a major role in
directing all major criminal activities in the Montreal
area. Previous reports have identified the members of the
COTRONI organization.

In March of 1966, PETER A, MAGADDINO and DOMINIC
ROMEO were reportedly in touch with VINCE! COTRONI and
PAUL VIOLI in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. @

On November 28, 1966, the Montreal Police
Department, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, arrested WILLIAM
BONANNO, also known as SALVATORE VINCENT BONANNO, the son of
JOE BONANNO, PATRICK and VITO DE FILIPPO, LOUIS GRECO,

PETER NOTARO, CARL SIMARI and PETER JOSEPH MAGADDINO, a
cousin of STEVE MAGADDINO who had been missing from his
residence on Grand Island, New York, for several years.
These individuals refused to furnish any information as to
the prupose of their being in Canada. hey were all
subsequently deported from Canada. 4 U

On January 15, 1967, NY T-185 advised that VINCENT
COTRONI of Montreal, Quebec, had in recent days been
engaged in a number of meetings at Montreal, The infermant
yas of the opinion that this indicated some type of a
meeting in the United States in the near future, which meeting
would probably be attended by COTRONI, who had left Moruroal
for an unlnown destination.

According to informant, there is some indication
that COTRONI had been in difficulty with the "MAGADDINO
Femily" in Buffalo, New York, and there have been efforts
on the part of COTRONI to negotiate some sort of
settlement relative to these difficulties. It was suggested
at one time that COTRONI, himself, might travel to the
ted States, but when he apparently refused to do so,

L VIOLI was suggested as a possible intermidiary.
VZOLI, however, according to NY T-185 refused to travel
to the United States when iit deel) Pe to his safety

were apparently not forthcoming.

According to NY T-185, COTRONI is a member of
the "BONANNO Group", and there is speculation that this
potential meeting could be to “bury, the hatchet" by the
“BONANNO end MAGADDINO Groups "DE

Information has been received that charges were
leveled by the former Justice Minister CLAUDE WAGNER of
Quebec, that the LCN has infiltrated the concessions
at Expo-67 in Montreal. He has named the following
companies as those to which he has reference:

Fleur de Lys Vending Machines, Inc.
New System Towel Supply

O'Bront Meat Market
