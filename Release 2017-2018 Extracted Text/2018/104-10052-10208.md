PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL

A, CURRENT OBJECTIVES a

The LIENVOY Project proyides for a|
‘tap unit provides

direct support necessary to cover targets and operational programs levied on the
Mexico Station via the RMD as well as spot requests from Headquarters and other
Stations. This Project also produces positive intelligence,

During the last project year there have been no changes in the agent
personnel. For the information of reviewing officials there is enclosed’es
Attachment-1, a chart listing current LIENVOY targets as well es functions of
LIENVOY egents, Arnold F, AREHART, Steff Agent, has been responsible for mainten-
ance of the technical equipment for the past five years. His work continues to
be outstanding end accounts for the fact thet efter almost six years' use, the
equipment is in good working order and hea susteined a minimm of loss through
negligent breakage or theft (both very common in Mexico). There has been no major
mechanical breakdown since AREHART has been supervising the maintenance of the
equipment. . ome bee sor

C. INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

While telephone tap operations are’ commonly classified as "support operations",
the LIENVOY Project by nature of some of its targets, has produced considerable

positive intelligence, It has been reviewed both at Hesdquarters and in the
Mexico Station as one of the most productive telephone tep projects in KUBARK
of both FI and CI/CE information. i
(1) PI information. From 1 February, 1964 through 31. December 1964, this
project was the source of 240 positive reports. The general subject categories
within which these reports fall.as related to objectives of the most recent RMD
(HMMS-3190 dated 21 October 1963) ares
i
Priority A. 1, 2, 3, end Priority B, 1, 2, and 4,
Cuben Embassy Activities in Mexico
Soviet Bubassy Activities in Mexico 24

Communist Front Activities (Movimiento Liberacion Nacional - MLN) in
Mexico H

Activities of Commmist, Leftist ba

figures i
Activities of Communist China representatives in Mexico

(2) cI/ck information. In eddition to the general subject categories of
FI interest, the LIENVOY Project fulfills a standing requirement to provide
CI/CE data on the following selected targets: Cuban Mnbassy - six lines; Soviet
Embassy ~ five lines; Czech Embassy - two lines; Polish Exbassy - 2 lines;
Yugoslav Enbassy - two lines (disconnected in April 196+); and the Commmist
Chinese News Agency (NCNA) - one line (being installed as of January 1965).

D. EEFECTIVENESS

(1) From 1 February 1964 through December 1964 (eleven months) the LIENVOY
Project covered a totel of 30 (thirty) targets simltaneously which provided
7,462 reels of raw take. This was processed into 21,564 pages of transcripts
{of this amount actual count by LIENVOY processors was 17,064 peges, an estimate
by the outside Czech translator was 1,500 pages, Russien translator 2,000 pages,
and Polish translator 1,000), Enclosed as Attachment~2 is a copy of the work
load log and list of targets which Arnold PF, AREHART provides the Station on a
monthly basis. This log, of course, includes only the work done inside the LP
and vartence of monthly figures is accounted for by additional work done by other
Station trenslators. .

nT targets listed above, 15 were covered similtaneously depending
‘upon interest in the individual at the times however, lines to all the
above run into the intercept center and can be connected as machines become
avatleble when other lines are out of order or disconnected for one reason or
another, i

The reels from the above targets are not transcribed completely,
monitors extract significant conversations and include them in the 2Y
the original of which is read daily by (IRAMA)and a copy of which is
daily to the Mexico Station. The
fuller transcripts if requested by
‘the Mexico Station, ane 8 typed in four copies at the end of each
day (covering conversat: wi occurred thet day),;,0n the following morning
by 0800 hours, one copy is hand-carried by Y-2 to LIRAMA,) At the same time,
Arnold F, AREHART delivers a copy to Robert B. RIGGS for delivery to Willard C.
CURTIS, A third copy is delivered to(LIELEGANT by LIENVOY-2) The fourth copy is
retained in e chronological file in the intercept center, o!.01

(>) _KUBARK Targets. ‘The Mexico Station CI/CE requirement is partially
fulfilled by LIENVOY which during the past project year covered the telephone
lines of the Cuban Bnbessy, Soviet Eubassy, Czech Bubassy, Polish Bubassy, Yugoslev
Embassy, and made preliminary installation for the Commmist Chinese News Agency
(NONA). ‘There follows selected significant examples of the LIENVOY product from
each of these targets with a Station appraisal of its effectiveness.

1. Cuban Enbassy. The six lines covered ere:

14 ke 37 The Ambassador's private telephone
5 5 The Chancery |
Us 13 26 The Chancery ©

25 4 The Commercial Office
11 28:47 The Consulate

25 O7 TT Elena Vasquez Gomez

The Chancery and Consulate lines regularly identify foreigners in
Mexico who contact the Cuban Embassy. Expeditious processing of

the transcripts frequently permits the, Station to_arrange for.”
unilateral survetHlance: amt identification of other contects.~ The —_—
Commercial Office coverage provides information on Cuben Commercial
activities in Mexico and identification of firms dealing with Cube.

The Elena Vasquez Gomez target has been of interest in connection
with the AMROD operation. The AMROD Headquarters Case Officer, Thomas

In _ eee



14-00000

- G. URQUHART (ps), presently: in Mexico on temporary duty has
provided the Station with the following evaluation of the LIENVOY
product: "The LIENVOY production on the Cuban Bubassy traffic in
Mexico City has been one of, the basic elements contributing to the
success of the AMROD operation, directed against the CUIS for CA
purposes. The LIENVOY operation has been of value in two general
senses: a. The documentary material derived from the texts has
formed some of the basis for reconstruction of historical facts
needed for the operation. b, The day to day coverage has enabled
the case officer on the AMROD operation to sense the climate inside
the target, to keep track of the movements of key opposition personnel,
to check on the bona fides of certain agents, to check the work of
others for veracity end to live monitor portions of the reactions
to the AMROD operation itself, Being able to keep track of the
shifts and movements of the. opposition and their personal relations
has been of vital importance to this operation. On two occasions
the AMROD Case Officer also used the LIENVOY base as his command
post when engineering personal contacts between a KUBARK staffer
end the opposition. This type of close support did mich to determine
the success of those meetings and contributed greatly to the success
of the operation. These transcripts provide one of the best sounding
boards for the AMROD operation and are regularly forwarded to me at
Headquarters." 1

The six lines above are fully transcribed by LIENVOY transcribers
and delivered by AREHART to RIGGS each morning. Lengthy conversa~
tions sometimes require an additional dey for transcription. A
carbon copy is pouched weekly to Headquarters for WH/SA use. The
original is retained by the Mexico Station. A third copy is retained
in the intercept center chronological files?\ does not read
these transcripts unless some significant item appedrs in the

which causes him to ask for a fuller transcript or listen

le vepe.

The coverage of this terget also yields a good picture of daily
activities, residences, personal habits and weaknesses of Cuban
official personnel in Mexico, This is used by Station Case Officers
in selection of targets for recruitment and in checking on activities
of agents already recruited and either working for or in contact

-with Enbassy officials.

2. Soviet Embassy, ‘The Soviet Government has over fifty officials
permanently stationed in Mexico (the largest foreign embassy except

. for the U.S.). . Thirty-four of these Soviets (slmost 70 percent of
the staff) are-kmown or suspect intelligence officers, The-five~
lines under LIENVOY provide details on the activities of mst of-
these Soviets, The lines are:

a



14-00000

i
15 6055 Soviet Consulate and Chancery. ‘This line is used by
fifteen (15) knova or suspect KGB officers, It is also
used by foreigners in Mexico attempting to make contact with
the Soviets. When contacts suggest clandestine meetings, the
Station arranges for unilateral surveillance and has had
some success in identifying contacts.

15 6155 Soviet Chancery, This line is used primarily by the Ambassador
and provides more: information on protocol contacts than leads
of intelligence interest. However, it gives the Station a
picture of the personalities being cultivated by Soviet
diplomats and of Mexicans who are seeking contacts with the
Soviets. i

15 61 07 Soviet Comercial! Office, Four (4) known or suspect GRU
officers use this mmber. They are Military intelligence
officers using Commercial Office cover and in some instances
actually perform commercial functions of trade negotiations
but the volume of trade between Mexico and the USSR does
not justify a Commercial Office staff of eight (8) Soviets.
‘This produces some information useful to check on double
egent operations run by the Station against the GRU officers.
In addition, the LIENVOY product usually identifies the
GRU officers as escorts for trade, scientific, commercial,
and tourist delegations who now are constantly on trips
from the USSR to Mexico, LIENVOY also provides details of
the itineraries of these groups once they arrive in Mexico,

15 12 64 Soviet Films Office. This leads into the residence’ and
office of Vladimir Petrovich OBRUBOV, a suspect GRU officer,
who distributes Soviet Commercial Films in Mexico. There
have been several. calls from what appear to be Central
fmericans but the Station has not been successful in identify-
ing the callers or determining the nature of the calls,

15 © 87 Soviet Military Attache. This is the least productive of
the coverage simply because the Soviet Military officers
either won't answer the telephone or spend very little time
where it rings. Nevertheless, U.S. AWOL servicemen try
this number to make contact, There are three GRU colonels
end six (6) civilian GRU officers who use this line.

The Soviet information is transcribed by the LIENVOY transcribers in
the seme way as the Cuban’ traffic except that the transcripts are
delivered daily with the reels from which an outside. translator -
(Douglas J, FEINGLASS) trenscribes the Russian conversations into
English. These Russian conversations are of considerable value and
it is apparent that the Soviets are not aware that these conversations
are being overheard and understood, There have been conversations
identifying code room personnel; one conversation between two Soviet
children revealed the entire layout of the Soviet Commercial Office;
personality clashes and grievances are also aired.



In June 1964 the SR Division. made available personnel for temporary
auty in Mexico to analyze and collate personality and background
data collected by LIENOY but which had accumlated in Station

files on Soviet officials. These Soviet Personality Reports (SPR)
should be useful on a world-wide basis as Soviet officials are
transferred from post to post, in providing the KUBARK representative
with a sumary of the Soviet's past work pattern, intelligence
activities as fer as known, physical description, weaknesses, and
vulnerability toward recruitment by a Western service. Not all but
a large percentage of this data is received from LIENVOY.

3. Czech Embassy, Two lines in the Chancery (15-30-91 and 45~:
are Covered by LIENVOY, Reels from these targets are delivered
daily by AREHART to RIGGS who delivers them to the EE Case Officer
who arrenges for transcription end translations to be done by David

B, SCHLAGHTER, field contract agent. This agent also prepares a
monthly summary of information on the activities of Czech officials
in Mexico, During September 1964 LIENVOY revealed important informa-
tion on the establishment of a factory equipped with Czech machinery
to produce dyes in Mexico (ANYL MEX), In addition to the significance
of this information in assessing Czech economic activities in Mexico,
there was operational benefit in dealing wit! BER, a Czech
official on temporary duty in Mexico in coméction with the opening
of this factory.

12)

4, Polish Bubassy, LIENVOY covers one line (11 25 49) in the main
Chancery which produces data on the activities of Polish officials
stationed in Mexico. The second line (25 82 58) is the private line
of Polish Commercial Counselor, Czeslaw SLOW,

Mexico Station has a definite operational interest

Reels (without trenscripts) from these targets ere vered

daily By AREHART to RIGGS who delivers them to the EE Case Officer
who arrenges for translations and transcriptions to be done by Norma
Q. RYMINSKY, @ contract employee.

5. Yugoslav Enbassy. During part of the project year LIENVOY

covered two lines in this Eubassy. The lines were disconnected by
LIENVOY in April 196+ and transferred to LIFEAT,, The reason for

this termination was to conceal interest in QMPEIAL, en(agent recruited )-
as a result of a follow-up of a lead supplied through LIENWVOY coverage.
During the time this target was covered, LIENVOY transcribers provided
transcriptions of the Spanish conversations. The reels were then
delivered to Victor W. OBOLD, a career agent who provided translations.

In sumary, the Station Case Officers responsible for established FI
end CI/CE programs feel thet LIENVOY has made a very necessary intelligence
support contribution, It should be noted that LIENVOY facilities during the
project year produced about three times the volume of raw audio take as that
produced by LIFEAT over the seme length of time at approximately one half the
cost. This is possibly due to the (entralized\tapping and transcribing fasilities
of LIENVOY as c with the widely scattered ones of LIFEAT, LIENVOY(as a24
is eble to tap any phone desired whereas LIFEAT, (as @ 4
mist teke greater security precautions. The Chief of
ation Wexico feels that the success of Station Mexico's operational program
against the Cuban, Soviet and Soviet Satellite installations and personnel in
Mexico is largely attributable to the continuous and thorough coverage of these
targets provided by LIENVOY. COS recommends that the project be renewed for
another year as an essential collection and support operation for the Mexico
Station,
