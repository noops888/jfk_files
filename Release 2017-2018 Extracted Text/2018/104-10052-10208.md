PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL

A.

CURRENT OBJECIIVES

the Lawvoy Project provides for a

telenhone tan unit and for/el

The tap unit provides

direct support necessary to cover targets and operational prograns levied on the

Mexico Station via the RMD as well as spot requests from Headquarters and other

Stations. This Project also produces positive intelligence.

B. CHANGES

(1) Operational Mechanism

09 The LINVOY Project was created in late 1958)and put into operation In

early (1959) at the request of ([ITENSOR) who appointed LIFLEGANT as his special 01, 024

assistant to work with Willard C. CURIIS in the supervision and administration of

the project.

In mid-1964 1t became evident that (LIRAMA would replace LITWNSOR)1n24

December 1964. (LIRAMA was then LIIEMPO-2 and a

Willard C. CURTIS under the LITEMPO

CURTIS/LIELEGANT/LITENSOR relationship in Project LTENVOY.) On 10 August 1964

01,01 ZIRAMA (LITEMPO-2) asked CURTIS and LIFTEGANI for a conference (reported to Head-

quarters in MAXI-0521 dated 10 August 1964).

"'At this meeting,' LIRAMA advised that

ol LITENSOR) had briefed him on the LINNVOY Project in detail and that 1t

should be,

continued with the same personnel and menner of operation. ' (TELEGANI) and @TENVOY-2

have been given nominal positions which provide cover for daily reports to (LIRAMAs/

and the local agents working in the IP." @TRAMA has requested that the li remain

the last project year there have been no changes in the agent

For the information of reviewing officials there is enclosed as

Attachment-I, a chart listing current LIENVOY targets as well as functions of

LTENVOY agents. Arnold F. AREHART, Staff Agent, has been responsible for mainten-

ance of the technical eguipment for the past five years. His work continues to

be outstanding and accounts for the fact that after almost six years? use, the

equipment is in good working order and has sustalned a minimm of loss through

negligent breakage or theft (both very common in Mexico).

There has been no major

mechanical breakdown since ARBHART has been supervising the maintenance of the

equipment

INLELAIGENCE PRODUCHION

While telephone tap operations are commonly classifled as "support operations",

positive intelligence.

It has been reviewed both at Headquarters and in the

Mexico Station as one of the most productive telephone tap projects in KUBARK

of both FI and CI/CE information.

(1) FI information.

From 1 February, 1964 through 31 December 1964, this

project was the source of 240 positive reports.

The general subject categories

within which these reports fall as related to objectives of the most recent RMD

(HMMS-3190 dated 21 October 1963) are:

Priority A. 1, 2, 3, and Priority B. 1, 2, and 4.

Cuban Embassy Activities in Medico

Soviet Embassy Activitles in Mexico

24

Cormunist Party of Mexico (PCM) Activities in Mexico

Communist Front Activities (Movimiento Liberacion Nacional - MLN) in

Mexico

Activities

of commnist, Leftist,

figures

Activities of Communist China representatives in Mesaco

24

(2) CI/CE information.

In addition to the general subject categores of

FI interest, the ITANVOY Project fulfills a standing reguirement to provide

CI/CE data on the following selected targets: Cuban Embassy • six lines; Sovlet

Embassy - five lines; Czech Embassy - two lines; Folish Embassy - 2 lines;

Yugoslav Embassy - two lines (disconnected in April 1964); and the Communist

Chinese News Agency (NCNA) - one line. (being installed as of January 1965).

D. EDYEGHIVENESS

(1) From 1 February 1964 through December 1964 (eleven months) the LLENVOY

Project covered a total of 30 (thirty) targets simultaneously which provided

7,462 reels of raw take. This was processed Into 21,564 pages of transcripts

(of this amount actual count by LIBNVOY processors was 17,064 pages,

an estimate

by the outside Czech translator was 1,500 pages,

Russian translator 2,000 pages,

and Polish translator 1, 000).

Enclosed as Attachment 2 1s a copy of the work

load log and list of targets which Arnold F. AREHARI provides the Station on a

monthly basis.

This log, of course, includes only the work done Inside the IF

exclusively for KUBARK. The remaining targets are selected by (LIRAMA) but are

usually of interest to KUBARK as sources of positive intelligence. The Mexican

(b) KUBARK Targets.

The Mexico Station CI/CE requirement is partially

fulfilled by LIENVOY which during the past project year covered the telephone

lines of the Cuban Embassy, Soviet Embassy, Czech Embassy, Polish Embassy, Yugoslav

Embassy, and made preliminary installation for the Commnist Chinese News Agency

(NCA) •

There follows selected significant examples of the ITENVOY product from

each of these targets with a Station appraisal of its effectiveness.

Expeditious processing.of

the transcripts frequently permits the Station to arrange for

unilateral survetllance and identification of other contacts.. The

Conmercial Office coverage provides Information.on Cuban Commercial

activities in Mexico and identification of firms dealing with Cuba.

The Flena Vasquez Gomez target has been of interest in connection

with the AMROD operation.

G. URQUHARI (ps), presently in Mexico on temporary duty has

provided the Station with the following evaluation of the LIENVOY

product:

"The LINVOY production on the Cuban Embassy traffic in

Mexico City has been one of the basic elements contributing to the

success of the AMROD operation, directed against the CUIS for CA

purposes. The LIENVOY operation has been of value in two general

senses:

The documentary material derived from the texts has

formed some of the basis for reconstruction of historical facts

needed for the operation.

b.. The day to day coverage has enabled

the case officer on the AMROD operation to sense the climate Inside

the target, to keep track of the movements of key opposition personnel,

to check on the bona fides of certain agents, to check the work of

others for veracity and to live monitor portions of the reactions

to the AMROD operation itself.. Being able to keep track of the

shifts and movements of the opposition and their personal relations

has been of vital importance to this operation®

On two occasions

the AMROD Case Officer also used the LINNVOY base as his cormand

post when engineering personal contacts between a KUBARK staffer

and the opposition.

This type of close support did much to determine

the success of those meetings and contributed greatly to the success

of the operation.

These transcripts provide one of the best sounding

boards for the AMROD operation and are regularly forwarded to me at

Headguarters."

The six lines above are fully transcribed by LIENVOY transcribers

and delivered by AREHART to RIGGS each morning.

Lengthy conversa

tions sometimes require an additional day for transcription.. A

carbon copy is pouched weekly to Headquarters for WH/SA use. The

original is retained by the Mexico Station.

A third copy is retained

In the intercept center chronological files.! (LIRAMA does not read

these transcripts unless some significant item appears in the

_which causes him to ask for a fuller transcript or listen

to the tape.

The coverage of this target also yields a good picture of dally

activities, residences, personal habits and weaknesses of Cuban

official personnel in Mexico.

This is used by Station Case Officers

In selection of targets for recruitment and in checking on activities

of agents already recruited and either working for or in contact

-with Embassy officials.

2. Soviet. Embassy.

The Soviet Government has over fifty officials

permanently stationed in Mexico (the largest foreign embassy except

for the U.S.).. Thirty-lour of these Soviets (almost 70 percent of

the staff) are mown or suspect intelligence officers. The five

lines under LIENVOY provide details on the activlties of most of

these Soviets.

The Lines are:

SEGNET / KAPC.

## Page 7

C. SECRET/ KAPCK

- 6 -

15 60 55

Soviet Consulate and Chancery This line is used by

fifteen (15) known or suspect KGB officers. • It 1s also

used by foreigners in Mexico attempting to make contact with

the

soviets.

When contacts suggest Clandestine meetings, the

Station arranges for unilateral surveillance and has had

some success in identifying contacts.

15 61 55

Soviet Chancery. This line is used primarily by the Ambassador

and provides more information on protocol contacts than leads

of intelligence interest.

However, it gives the Station a

picture of the personalities being cultivated by Soviet

diplomats and of Mexicans who are seeking contacts with the

Soviets.

15 61 07 Soviet Commercial Office.

Four (4) known or suspect GRU

officers use this number.

They are Military intelligence

officers using Commercial Office cover and in some instances

actually perform commercial functions of trade negotiations

but the volume of trade between Mexico and the USSR does

not justify a Commercial Office staff of eight (8) Soviets.

This produces some information useful to check on double

agent operations run by the Station against the GRU officers.

In addition, the LIENVOY product usually Identifies the

GRU officers as escorts for trade, scientific, commercial,

and tourist delegations who now are constantly on trips

from the USSR to Mexico. LIENVOY also provides details of

the Itineraries of these groups once they arrive in Mexico.

15 12 64 Soviet FIlms OffIce.

This leads into the residence and

office of Vladimir Petrovich OBRUBOV, a suspect GRU officer,

who distributes Soviet Commercial Films in Mexico.. There

have been several calls from what appear to be Central

Americans but the Station has not been successful In identify

ing the callers or determining the nature of the calls.

15 69 87

Soviet Military Attache.

This is the least productive of

the coverage simply because the Sovlet Military officers

either won't answer the telephone or spend very little time

where it rings.

Nevertheless, U.S. AWOL servicemen try

this number to make contact.

There are three GRU colonels

and six (6) civilian GRU officers who use this line.

The Soviet Information Is transcribed by the LIENVOY transcribers in

the same way as the Cuban traffic except that the transcripts are

delivered daily with the reels from which an outside translator:

(Douglas J. FEINGLASS, transcribes the Russian conversations into

English.

These Russian conversations are of considerable value and

1t is apparent that the Soviets are not aware that these conversations

are being overheard and understood.

There have been conversations

Identifying code room personnel; one conversation between two Soviet

children revealed the entire layout of the Sovlet Commercial Office;

personality clashes and grievances are also aired.

C. SECRET / MAPOKE

In June 1964 the SR Division. made available personnel for temporary

duty in Mexico to analyze and collate personality and background

data collected by LTENVOY but which had accumulated in Station

fIles on Soviet officials. These Soviet Personality Reports (SPR)

should be useful on a worldwide basis as Soviet officials are

ransferred from post to post, In providing the KUBARK representativ

ith a sumary of the soviet's past work pattern, intelligenc

activities as far as known, physical description, weaknesses, and

vulnerability toward recruitment by a Western service.

Not all but

a large percentage of this data is received from LIENVOY.

• Czech Embassy® Two Ilnes In the Chancery (45-30-91 and 45-30-12

re covered by LIENVOY. Reels from these targets are delivere

daily by ARFHART to RIGGS who delivers them to the FE Case Officer

who arranges for transcription and translations to be done by David

B. SCHLAGHTER, field contract agent.

This agent also prepares a

monthly summary of information on the activities of Czech officials

In Mexico.

During September 1964 LIINVOY revealed Important informa-

tion on the establishment of a factory equipped with Czech machinery

to produce dyes in Mesico (ANYT, MEX).

In addition to the significance

of this information in assessing Czech economic activities In Mexico,

there was operational benefit in dealing with DISOBER, & Czech

official on temporary duty in Mexico In connection with the opening

of this factory.

4.

Polish Embassy®

LIENVOY covers one line (11 25 49) In the main

Chancery which produces data on the activities of Polish officials

stationed in Mexico.

The second line (25 82 38) 1s the private line

of Polish Conmercial Counselor, Czeslaw SLOWAKIEWIE. In whom the

Mexico Station has a definite operational Interest

Reels (without transcripts) from these targets are delivered

dally by ARFHART to RIGGS who delivers them to the EE Case Officer

who arranges for translations and transcriptions to be done by Norma

Q. RYMINSKY, & contract employee.

5. Yugoslay Embassy.

During part of the project year ITHNVOY

covered two lines in this Embassy.

The lines were disconnected by

LENVOY In April 1964 and transferred to LIFEATS? The reason for

this termination was to conceal interest in DMPEIAL, an lagent recruited

as a result of a follow-up of a lead supplied through IIENVOY coverage.

During the time this target was covered, IIENVOY transcribers provided

transcriptions of the Spanish conversations.

The reels were then

delivered to Victor W. OBOLD, a career agent who provided translations.

Communist China' News Agency (NCNA).

In summary,

the Station Case Officers responsible for established FI

and CI/CE programs

feel that LINVOY has made a very necessary intelligence

support contribution

It should be noted that LIENVOY facilities during the

project year produced about three times the volume of raw audio take as that

produced by LIFEAT over the same length of time at approximately one half the

cost.

This is possibly due to the (centralized tapping and transcribing factlities

of LINNVOY as compared with the widely scattered ones of LIFEAI.

LTENVOY (as a 24

Is able to tap any phone desired whereas LIFEAT, (as a ≥4

must take greater security precautions.

The Chief of

Station Mexico feels that the success of Station Mexico's operational program

against the Cuban, Sovlet and Soviet Satellite Installations and personnel in

Mesico is largely attributable to the continuous and thorough coverage of these

targets provided by LTENVOY. COS recommends that the project be renewed for

another year as an essential collection and support operation for the Mexico

Station®
