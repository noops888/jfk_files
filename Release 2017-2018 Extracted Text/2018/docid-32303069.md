FROM:

SAC, PITTSBURGH (92-236) (92-228)

SUBJECT: GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka.,

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.,

on 2/28/61, SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III, observed GABRIEL MANNARINO'S

cottage, located on Old Leechburg Road, R. D. #3, Leechburg, Pa.,

and it appears as though construction is completed.

This means

the cottage now has five rooms:

three bedrooms, a living room -

dining room, and a kitchen; and it also has a fairly large

screened porch.

Nobody was noted in the area, and no cars were

observed in the driveway or parking area, but

the three German

shephed dogs were in the outdoor pen to the rear and right of

the cottage.

No telephone line was observable, and PCI HERBERT

DEE RAY, who lives across the road from the cottage was not

avallable for interview.

Because of previously set forth information to the effect that

GABRIEL MANNARINO spends considerable time at this cottage, has

nany visitors at odd hours of the night, and may move into 1t a

a permanent residence, Pittsburgh plans

to make every effort ta

establish whether or

not highly confidential coverage can be ef-

fected there.
