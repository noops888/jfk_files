Type of case involved: AR

Connection or status of subject in the case: ROCCO SCAFIDI has
proven his membership in La Cosa Nostra. His membership

technical surveillance:

SCAFIDI, a proven.-member of La Cosa Nostra, for one month
has resided at 1531 S. Broad St., Phila. La Cosa Nostra
member FRANK MONTE during period has visited this apartment
on two occasions. Other La Cosa Nostra members will also
visit this address to contact SCAFIDI. He has an appoint-
ment to-meet Commission Member ANGELO BRUNO and La Cosa
Nostra member FRANK NICOLETTI at this address during current
week,

Importance of case and subject: Informant, a known member of La
Cosa Nostra, will get other La Cosa Nostra members at this

Possibilities of obtaining desired information by other means

(Explain in detail): Other sources and informants, including
SCAFIDI, furnish information re La Cosa Nostra. The day-to-
day activities of lesser figures in La Cosa Nostra, such as
FRANK MONTE, ERNEST PERRICONE and others has not been forth-
coming from confidential sources. These individuals are close
associates of SCAFIDI and will. feel free to talk about previous
and future La Cosa Nostra activities in which they are involved.
La Cosa Nostra members JOSEPH SCAFIDI and SAM SCAFIDI, uncle
and brother of ROCCO SCAFIDI respectively will probably meet
at this address. Sources have not previously furnished ex-
tensive information re these latter two individuals.

Risks of detection involved:

There will be no risk of detection involved. Altered 404
er telephone "Jacks" will be used. These afford less risk of
detection than any other type installation.

90 day trial period.

Request made for technical surveillance by any outside agency
(name specific official, title and agency):

None.

that La Cosa Nostra will be the subject of conversation
when associates of SCAFIDI visit him at this address.
