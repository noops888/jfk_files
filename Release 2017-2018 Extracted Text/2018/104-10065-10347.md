aa 12 April 1977

Phone coversation with June in Fendig's office, re attached
note:

June said 'Mr. Bishop provided an assessment on somebody but

we also determined that this is a different Mr. Bishop. Bishop
never worked for us. His only interest to DCD was because of

his knowledge about a Professor who was extremely knowledgeable
about French political situations in 1964. He never provided any

substantive knowledge." Gx. Orb ov by»
