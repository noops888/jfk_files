Review Staff 76-0070/a (13 January 1976)

1. The following CIA Staff Employees, all of whom are

now retired, participated in the preparation of DIR 86054

on 30 November 1963:

Originator:

Coordinators:

Mr. Louis Armstrong

Mr. John M. Whitten, Mr.

Ms. Sue L. Darling

("for". Desmond

Releasor:

Mr. John M. Nhitten ("for" J.C. King)

We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana

flight No. 465 on Z2 November 1963 fron Mexico City to Havana,

cuba, was Mario MAURi who was accompanied by his wife, Naria

Antonieta MAURI. We have been unable to determine who trans-

mitted the information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we

have not been able to locate any documents relating to this

matter in Latin America Division files or the Ofwald file.

We have been unable to locate any documents which

would indicate that there was a response to DIR 86054 from

Mexico City.

4. Assuming there was no response to DIR 86054, the

originating Headquarters component should have initiated

followup action if a response was not received.

We have been unable to find any further information

relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.
