SUBJECT :. Senate Select Committee Request

= (Charles Ford)

1. Reference is made to a 28 August 1975 memorandum
from the Review Staff (75/2723), which contains a request
from Mr. Mike Madigan, Senate Select Committee Staff, for
information concerning the possible use by the Agency of
one Charles Ford to establish contacts with the ‘underworld
for possible use against Fidel Castro. Referenced request
indicated that Charles Ford was an Agency chicane who was
utilizing the name “Rocky Siscalini."

2. A review-of the Office of Security indices dis-
closed both an overt. and covert file on one Charles D. Ford
“(SF #38 497), a current Agency ‘employee serving with the
Office o£ Training/Deputy Directorate for Administration.
Cited files disclosed that circa 1962-1963, Charles D. Ford
was issued official alias documentation under the name
"Charlies D. Fiscalini.”

3. Charles D. Ford has been an Agency staff employee
since 1952. The Office of Security files relating to Mr. Ford
do net contain any information which would indicate he had
been used to contact underworld figures for possible use
against Fidel Castro.’ However, in November 1961 Mr. Ford was
assigned to the Deputy Directorate for Operations, Western
Hemisphere Division as an Operations Officer. A memorandum
contained in his files, dated 30 March 1962, indicates that
Mr. Ford was issued alias documentation under the name of
“Charlies D..Fiscalini.’ Cited memorandum further indicates
that Mr. Ford was then assigned to "Task Force W," and was
to travel to New York on 31 March 1962 to meet with an un-
identified attorney who had contacted Mr. Robert Kennedy, the
then Attorney General, concerning assistance for Cuban prisoners.
