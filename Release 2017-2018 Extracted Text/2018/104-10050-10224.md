SU"JECT: "elay in sending the first cable about
OSWALD

1. Much has been written about the dela (ty. the Mexico
Station) ins ending the first cable requesting traces on the
name Lee OSWALD. It was discussed in Dave Phillips book a a
case of lazinss on the part of the Soviet case officer (wich
in Wy view was unjust and unnecessary and indicates that Dave
didn't know what he was talking about).

2. Normally, the Spanish transcript for the 1 October
convers ation would have been picked up on the morning: df.
2nd of October. ‘he Russian langogge portion would have:
to the Russ ian/English transcriber on the 3rd of-October. ‘he
trans lation would have been returned the follawing day (4th)
at which time, the Soviet case officer woyid have™a ked for
the photographic coverage. That coverag@ uld not have been
in the station before the 7th since uke, Sm was still in the
camera on the 3rd of October and 44% cked up probably on
the 4th, processed and passed
day which would have been M

es ‘ation on the next work
Hwctober,

3. Later the film was\biken out of the camera every day
but at that time, the films tayed in the camera until a full 2
rotl was completed wich might take three or four das.

4, A name trace could have been requested on the bas is ed
of the name alone but that wasn't the wy Win Scott ran that
Station. He wanted the photographic coverage tied in with the
telephone coverage ..s ometimes_there_was.a U.S. automobile
license number. It was also part of the "numbers game" of
jus tify ing a project ly the number of dis patches, cables or |
Feports produced. |

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963) |

1. Unilateral Coverage: i

S i
From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project teste imsted of multiline
phone taps, three photographic sites, a <a Sgpe’ Vance team and a

mail intercept operation.

a Telephone taps (L. ugg by an employee of the local i
a telephone company wi ‘ed by a Station case officer. The number i
: |

of lines tapped wal ted only by the availability of a listening post i

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

: Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer.

+ assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest ‘corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
‘graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
‘on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site wee middle of |
5 the block south. It had a planted view of t! Nid the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photogray re as located in one of a
row of four houses on the mg Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked the, jeden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
‘ purpose of this cre SN s to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed bya re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used Tate model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral eo operation, i
LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American ca; icer. A recruited
Mexican agent, who had a sori ae SS

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were » and corrupt. A Station
officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In
1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence. The operation, which became known as

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines i
connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A 1
Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening ]
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post. |

3. Oswald Coverage:
In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the ergy listening \
post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, oie ners satel lite Em-
bassies in anticipation of possible coverage’ Sie Se rion immediately

disconnected all of the unilateral bes on these Embassies so

that they would not be << the Mexicans hooked up their

taps. The Mexicans aC ‘ter connected five Cuban lines, five
Soviet lines, three Czeth lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
line. At the listening post, a live monitor. made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two, Reels which contained Russian

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the

pudlic by the Warren Cosmission. The photo operators were moved to another apt
nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSDIE
for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to be built.
on this site). LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the seme side of the street

as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slentéd view of

the front gate of the Soviet Exbassy, The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Vexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photd, sit was located

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if

the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

DURAN:
SOVIET:

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa hene”(in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly * shis man
(the American), showed him a letter inwhich’he“(the
American) is a member of an organizatich. in.favor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not -pive*hint the visa without

the Russian visa and now the oe Goesn't know what to do
with him, because he has. a “eee She answer from
Washington.

-.With them also, bec ee ten with him (the American)

thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take ‘long time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then’ go on to the USSR.

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now
or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can commmicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

is that he does: vente in Ciba and in that case it
is very se ve him a visa, because he was

..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because they do not now if the visa will be approved.
They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It.was no bother, thank you very much.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours 4 man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
Anerica, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
mow what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping-Yepresentatives
for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa infomation.) First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soyiet, Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (which turned outta ‘be’ thé Military Attache).
They got the phone number for the Consulate andthé address. After
making a call to the Consulate and Learningthat it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went. aehches: saddress to get the needed
information.)

oe
Just after 1600 hours, ‘the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem. The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and
has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOU in order to change that address and asks for the name
of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose mmber is 14-13-26, The Soviet thanks her.

Dear Dicks

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some
2: from the White House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the
FHI have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited
i as intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be
H ‘a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries
‘7:1, who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCID l/2,
| . : these persons might be described as those who have either been,

i 1. Capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose
py: desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited!
for communist propaganda purposes. This would mean that no attention
need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

.- attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

|, US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the

| = homeland" beosuse they had never been conpletely assimilated into

| the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18
months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and
; ... Possibly expand this Mat for the use of interested Bureaus of. the
i °” Departnent. G
