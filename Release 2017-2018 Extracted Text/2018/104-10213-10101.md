Many of those ve intervieved stressed tvo points that are so '

Drew Pearson's colur of 7 March 1967 refers to a reported CIA

informtioa, as yet umpublished, to the effect that there vas a
meeting at the State Deparizent at which assassination of Castro - s

on a Cuban exile plot to assassinate Castro. CIA bad refused
the exile‘s request for funds and kad =o involvezeat in the plot.
c. CIA tvice (first in early 196) acd again in early 1952)
supplied lethal pills to U.S. ganbling syadicate renders working

plot aborted and the pills vere recovered. ‘Those furnished in
April 1952 were passed by the ganbling syzdicate representative

Cuba about May 1962. In June 1962 the exile leader reported that

of means until after U.S. policy conceraing cuba was decided
upon about Harch 1960. By about the ead of the third quarter

of 1950, the total energies of the task force vere concentrated

on the main-thrust effort, and there would have been no interest

in nor tine for pursuing such vills-o'~the-visp as these. *

‘In a second interview with Esterline, ve mentioned that we bed learned

fall out. He then said that bis cigars might have been associated

with that plan. Esterline finally said that, althowgh it vas :

involving cigars. ‘o emphasize the clerity of his menory, te named
the officer, then assigned to Wa/CA, who approached him with the
scheme. Although there say vell have been such a plot, the officer
Gottlieb nazed was then assigned in India and hes never vorked in

remembers the scheme as being one that wus talzed about frequently
but not widely and as being concerned vith killing, not merely with
influencing telaviour. As fer as Gottlieb knovs, this idea never a

‘Operational Support Division, Office of Security. O'Connell and

Mabeu met Roselli. 4a New York City on 1k Septenber 1960 vhere Mabeu
made the pitch. Hosellf inttially was also reluctant to become
Snvolved, but finally agreed to ixtroduce Yabeu to “Sam Gola” who
either ked or could errange contacts with syniicate elesents in Cuba
vho might handle the Job. Boselli said he had no interest in being
paid for his partictpation and believed-that "Gold" vould feel. the

‘lela Zavaras

oa ls May 1962 states: “io monies were ever paid to Roselli aad 7

Gisacana, Maheu vas pat part of his expense acney during the periods
that he vas in Miast.” (Giancana is “gola.")
O'Connell vas introduced (ia true rahe) to Roselli as an eaployee

. of Maheu, the explanation teing that O'fon-ell vould handle the

case for Mabeu, because Mateu vas too busy to work on it full tine
himself. Ko one else in the Office of Security vas made witting of
the operation at this tire. Edvards hizself dia not meet Roselli Z

until the sumer of 1962.

At this point, about the second half of September, Shef Zdvards
told Bicsell that he bad e friend, a private investigator, vho had
@ contact who in tum had other contacts through vhom syndLeate

He did, hovever, learn their true ‘deatities. Aa Office of Security
penorancum to the DDCI of 2% June 1955 places the tine as “several
weexs later.” O'Connell is now ucertein as to whether it was on this

first visit to Miami or on a subsequent one that he and Makeu learned

_the true identities of the tvo men. Maheu and O'Connell vere staying

at separate hotels. Maheu phoned O'Connell one Sunday morning aad

this, undue significance should not be attached to advance

Edvards recelis approaching Roosevelt after Bissell hed already

recall specific conversations with either of them onthe technical

his first meeting with Edvards as being in Edvards' office. Edvards

& general stand-by capability to carry out assassinations vhen required.

in that context, but he nov thinks that the operation vas over by

Well after the Pre-Zay of Pigs phase of the geubling syndicate

operation to assassinate Castro, and only indirectly related to it,

a development in the private life of Sem Giancana led to an incident

and required the briefing of the Attorney General on the details
of the assassination plan.

Fhyllis McGuire, of the singing McGuire sisters, vas and is
openly known to be Giancena's mistress. Giancara suspected her of
having aa affeir with Dan Rovan, of the Rowan esd Martin conedy tean.
Both Hovan and Hiss McGuire vere then entertaining in Las Vegne, and
Gtancana acked Maheu to put a bug in Roven's room. Maheu aia not vant

to do the Job and declined on the grounds that he vasn't equipped for

that sort of vork. Gianceza made a claim for a return fevor: he
bene worked on the Castro enatieabinta operation for Maheu, and

“Yaheu was indebted to hin. Giancana said ‘that at Mabeu wouldn't

take oa the Job, he, Glancara, vould go to las Vegas and do it -
hinself. Maheu agreed to arrange to have the rocm bugged. ~~

Although the Attorney General on 7 Yay 1952 vas givea a full and
frank account of the Agency's relations with Maheu, Rosell{, and
Giazcana in the Castro operation, Including the viretepping flap,
ft eppears that the FBI vas not given anything lixe the suze detail.

Tae Bureau quite properly was not wold ebout the assassication i

the assassinatioa operation vould have put it in an impossible bind,
since both Roselli and Gisncana were high on thc Bureau's “list.”

qhe briefing of Attorney General Kensedy was absolutely restricted

to hin, and we can only speculate that the confidence vas observed. -

Ir the information given the Bureau is as linited as the records —

and our inforsation indicate, then the Bureau has not been informed,

as the Attomey General vas, that the Agency was rizst unwitting and

then a reluctant accessory after the fact. It vould be surprising,
though, if the Bureau does not nov know the whole story of the Ias
Vegas bugging incident. Whether the Bureau may nov think that CIA vas
less than candid about the bugging incident (ae distinguished fron the

sensitive assassination operation) is a question for speculation.

What {5 available to the press ts undoubtedly available to the
Bureau. In fact, some indication of the extent of the Bureau's
kmovledse is found in a feature story in the Chicago Sun-Ties of

16 August 1963, with a Washington date Line, under the banner lead:

my * -"CIA SOUGHT GIARCANA HELP FOR CUBA SPYTXG"

“he article cites "Justice Department sourced'as expressing the belie?
that Giancens never did any spying at all for the CIA. He merely
Pretended to go along with the CIA: oe

“in the hope that the Justice Department's drive to put hin
behind bars migut be slowed - or at least affected ~ by his
Fuse of co-operation with erother goverment agency.”
‘The story places the period of the relationship from 1959 to:
-@-



“cose tize in 1960, lexg tefore the edorcive revel
nw sicn at the Bay of Pigs ia April, 1951."

Te newspaper then gives the folloviag version of the bugging incident:

"An equally bizarre episode months later gave the
Justice Department its first clue to Glancana's
negotiations with the CIA. ::

“The figures in this incident were a male night-
club entertainer and Ciancara's girl frierd,
Phyllis McGuire, one of the singing McGuire
sisters.

}

"At the tine, in Giencena's opinion, the entertainer
vas overly attentive to Miss McGuire.

“At Las Vegas, Nev., in 1961, sheriff's police
seized a prowler in the entertaizer‘s hotel suite.
care Por hours, the intruder refused to identify himself

C 2 or say he was rifling the entertainer's rooms.

"Fersistent questioning by sheriff's deputies, seatiic)
according to federal authorities, led to an : s

: admission by the provler that ke vas on the

: : * payroll of a private detective agency in Florida.

“Florida authorities sought an explanation of the
incident from the operator of the detective agency.
At first, the operutor refused to discuss the
matter. Finally, hovever, he told investigators
oe : to get in touch with the CIA.

le “The inquiry then shifted frou Florida to Washington
and revealed Clancara‘'s negotiations with CIA, i
it was disclosed. : : : 7

"Governzent sources reported Thursday that the .

private investigator's nission ia the Las Vegas

suite of the entertainer was another riddle of the

Giencana caper with the CIA. Meither CIA nor the :

explanation of what the investigator vas doing in

Four days later, ca 20 August 1953, the cnicago Dally News
reported further cn the subject under the followirg headline:
"Td TRUTH ABOU? CCGA NOSTRA CEIEY AND THE CIA” :

The story cited an incident in vbich Giancara literally b=ped into

an Fal agent vno vas tailing hin. Glancana was reported to have said,

"why don't you fellows leave ce alone? I's one of you!” Glancara
is represented in the revspaper account as having been approached by--

mentions the Lac Vegas incident, but in terms of saneone, possibly

+ CIA, ransicking a roan occupied by one of Giencana's heachsen who

_ bad just returned from Cuba. .

Oa 16 August 1963 the DD/P (Helms) sent s memorandun to the

“xecond sent to Attorney General Kennedy folloving the 7 May 1962

Drew Pearson clains to have a report that there vas a high-level |

first (and probably the oze to vaich Pearson refers) was at the

Departuent of State on 10 August 1962. It was a meeting of the :

True,

Not true. Ho was briefed on Gambling Syndicate-Phase
One after it was over. Me win not briefnd on Phate Two.

True.

Roselli infonned Harvey on 21 June 1962, presumably

on the basic of information from Varena, that a team
of three men wns inside Cuba. We do not know thelr
identities nor what may have happened to them. We have
no proof that they were actually dispatched. None

of the announced captures and executions during this
perted fits this team.

This reportedly has come out in the Garrison investie
gations. It also wae stated by Castillo in the

We have no
independent confirmation of any sort. (Note that
Garrison met with Rorelli in Lao Vegas in March 1967.)

True. At least we were told by Roselli that the pilis
were cent in during Phace One and again in Phase Two.

True. The subject ws raised at a meeting at State on
10 August 1962, but it 1a-unrelated to any actual
attempts at assassination. It did result in a MONGOOSE
action memorandum by Lansdale acoigning to CIA action
for planning liquidation of leaders. The offending
phrase was lnter excised from copies forwarded to CIA,
State, Defence, and USIA, but the damage may alroady
have been done. a . .

; g- According to Haheu, Morgan ead Jack cadersoa, Drev
: Pearson's associate, are very close.

nT Tais seems clearly to: point the finger at Roselli as the ulticate

source of the inforzation on the ganblinz sysdfcate plot and to

confirm Morgan as Pearson's source.

We can test the accuracy of this assumption against analysis we
had done earlfer in an effort to identify the lizely source of
= Pearson's story. Oa the opposite page is a listing of persons
i definitely nom + be witting of certain key facts now in Pearson's
: possession. the list includes CIA officers vho knew more than one
: of the key facts, plus all ‘mom outsiders. Teese were our
conclustons: 7 : :

@. If Drew Pearson has a single source, and if Pearson's
immediate source is the ultimate source of the leak, and if
compartmentation was not violated, then Bill Earvey exexges
as the Likely caniidate. Re was the only persoa ve foun2 in

the course of this inquiry vho knew all four of the key facts
at the time the Pearson colums appeared. We preferred not to
think that Bill Harvey was the culprit. We could find no_ ;
persuasive reason why he would visch to leak the story

deliberately, and ve doubted tuat he vould te so indiscreet as

O°

to leak it accidentally. Further, Lf he were the sourse, ve

could expect Pearson's story to be cocpletely uzcurate, because cs

Harvey knew the truth. i

ort iz b. If we ruled out Zarvey as the corree then it appeared
that there cust be at least tvo ulticate dources of leaks. ‘the
State Department meeting was not komm to aay of the ather

“ participants in the operation~-aszuming that Harvey did not

mention it to any of thes. Therefore, it is quite possible
that the leak on the State Departzent meeting bas come fron
sozeont vho has no direct knowledge of the gambling syndicate
~ operation but does know of the meeting.

¢ c. From the standpoint of vho-knev-vhat, the next post
Lizely source of the origiral leak is Jotm Roselli. He is, in
fact, the only person vith dtrect anf continuous partictpatiea
throughout both phases of the ganbling syndicate operation. He

inference to be drew fron O'Connell's discoveries in Las Vegas is

that Roselli is drinking too much and talking and that Morgan is alsa

Rot in this case. While 1¢ 1s trve that Phase Tvo vas carried

Fhase One vas initiated in August 1960 ucder the Eisenhower

Executive Action Capability, which reportedly was developed fa

When Robert Kemedy vas briefed oa Phase One in May 1952, he

of his CIA connection known and accepted. We cannot now suppress

the story, because it is already out and nay boil up afresh from the |

Garrison case. If we were to approach any of the participants and-
urge discretion upon hin, and if this became known, it would perely .
lend credence to a tale that nov sounds somevhat foprovable.
