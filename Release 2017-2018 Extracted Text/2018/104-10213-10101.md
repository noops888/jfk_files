In learning of the Rosell-Ho gua lin's, we are relleved of ise

need for speculation as to how the story las gutten out. It 1s

quite likely that Rosell1 1s the scurce, Morgan the channel, and

Anderson and Pearson ice recipients. He cay also be relieved of

the need for speculatica as to say the story is beinz told. The

Inference to be dram fros O'Conell's discovertes In Las Vegas 1s

#-We may now assune that Pearson's story 1s not patched

together fron bits and pieces picked up here and there. His

ultinate source, Rosell1, knous more about certain details of

the gambling syndiente operation than se do, and he evidently

has talked. Irying now to hush up further leaks migat dó nore
