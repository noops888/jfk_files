Conversation with Me. Jan Nowak

At your request, I lad a conversation iday will Mr. Jan

Nowak, acad of

the Tolisi radio desk of Wit in kunich. I a

that you did not got to see lin.

Our conversation reminded me that"

our work is terribly importait, wiic: is a nice reminder on a busy

afternoon.

2. I say "important" because Nowak reviered with me the lotters

ho had received fros listenars in Poland

these, togothor with nis

ott enormous enthusiast for the hork he is doing, reminded no that our

long days in lashinçton have an effect on tie lives and hopes of people

Howak, who was in the

Polish resistance during the war and

who on one of his three escapes from foland at one time spent several

wocks in Switzerland where he had nade contact with your raprecentatives,

Ister worked for the 330 and ho pointed out that at no time during the

war was he given to feel by the PSC the sonse of responsibility and

mission which he feols in his job in RiE.

He said he was told when

he Nas brought to RFE: that the

responsibility or the programs was his

and that if at any time procrang wont on the air wich wore irresponsible,

then he would lose his job.

He says that when he has questions which

he thinks might influence tuited states policy, lie confers beforchand

and the Arcricans in Munich, and sometines arguments ensue,

out he feels, and I am cortain to locls sincerely, that ho has an aqual

suare with Americans in a groat etfort to carry the truth back hanc..

3. I say "terribly" importalt because Nowak, like othar exilos,

wonders out loud hon long our work can continue to have an imbact.

is ninsoli' convinced tiat every Polish soldier is a potential ally of

the irost but he wondors, and makes his listener wonder, how long we can

apect tills sympathy among a rising goneration for which the past is

inexorably fading.

debate wicke

The following in from a dispaich written dy Mr. William Tylor, dated

22 June 1953.

1. After a recent conversation with Jean Paul David, al which time he

outlined hle activities and ideas in connoction with the mission with which

ho la charged by Georgos Bidaull, I received a lettor from him.

2. It will be seon from this letter that David is most anxioua that the

roport which he will nake on his curvey should reprosent, without committing

any one country, a syaliosia of the viawa and the resourced of the Western

powora allied under NATO, in the broad field of propaganda and paychological

warfare designod to build support for Vestern defenso policy and to promote

she achlevemen of te objoclives of these policies.

3. It occura to me tial a difficulty which we have to face, and which we

are probably unique in karing to face, is due so the organisational otructure

within which we oporate officially in the general field under diocuasion. In

a country like Ilaly, lor axample, il is possible for David to have exchangea

of views with high officials of the government and to foel reasonably suro

that even though such riems are not to be laten ad a commitment, they do in fact

represent the disposition of the governmeat in question, or any goverament

likaly to succeed it, toward these problems. In our case, homover, lt seemo

to me that it will reguiro careful preparation to determine with whom David

should consule and lo work out a conatructive position which will influence

his report and his recommendations in a direction which we approve.

A. It in particularly difficuis for mo to mate specific recommendations,

since devolopmenta iu H'ashingion in the last few months ara difficult to

keep up with from oversoad. I would, therefore, be particularly helpful

to have headquarters' viowa at this stage on the following points, assuming

that David will go to the States in late September os the last leg of his survey:

a. With whoi should he most for basic diacussions. (I occura to

me that a suitable body. il at ill in exiatonce, would so the Peychological

Operationa Coordinating Committee.)

b. Within mhai limita al this time aro me prepared to discusa the

problem of concerted action for the psychological strength of the North

Atlantic Community.

3. As beadquarters is aware, C. D. Jackson knows David personally,

and it would perhapa be uselul to arrange for conversations with him and

any group ho might have in mind. It is true that the position of David

in anomalous, since the curvey on which be le

engaged,

is of the most official

kind posaible.. As headquartere has pointed out, his Intorests in hio present

mission in reality pertain more to the State Department and NATO than

to ul. and it seema to me that we should not bo in the direct lino of lira

except in the capacity of individual observera or participante in the

conversatione he will have, It would, thereforo, deem to be all the more

important ibat we arrivo at a clear undorstanding among oursolves as to

how David's trip to the Staten will be organised and what la to be the

respective role of the component olomonte la the paychologleal effort with

the following pointa were discussed.

(1). A Strategy Board to guide RFE. Spencer feels the need

for some higher lovel political guidance than RFE is getting frona

their staff people and talked about getting together a board of people

like George Kennan,

eteI told Spencer that I thought it unlikely

that George would give very much time to this but might be willing

to give them an occasional idea or suggestion.

(3) Spencer seemed disturbed that the allocation of one

was not familiar with this particular issue.

• (4) He suggested that it would be well to have a meeting here

with some of the members of the Board and the Executive Commince

and suggested a date around the first week in Augugt..

I told him I

would do it is I had not already left the country by that time.

Memurandum fur the Kecord

Subject:

Conversation with Congressman Keraten

1. On 6 May Congressman Kersten addreased a letter la te

State Depariment, enclosing a lelter dared i May 1953, which he had

received from Mr. Greighton Scott, a foriner employee of Radio Free

Europe al Munich, Germany. This leller was highly critical of cer-

tain personnel in RFE, particularly as regarde allegations of pro-com-

munist attlludes. On 6 July I discussed these criticians with Cungress-

man Keraten in detail, conveying to him orally the material contained

in the memorandum of 17 June 1953 from te Director of Security; Subject:

Inquiry by Cungressman Keraten; which the Director ol Security had noted

should be utilired in this meeting with Congressinan Kersten.

2. The Congreseman noted the difficulty in evaluating the sype of

criticiams which air. Scolt hod made but appeared willing so accept our

explanation.

3. Congressman

Karaten then turned to certain cribeisins which

he had heard expressed regarding RFI from several sources, including

Scute.

One such crilicism ia that AFE is nt doing the best it sbould on

religious programs.

He feela that this aspect ui the broadcasts could

probably be considerably strengthened, particularly amung Catholic

elements.

4.

Mr. Kersien cited the opinion of Count Tarnowski (sp. ?), a well

known Pole, who told the Congresaman at any fourteen year old Soriet

citizen would be as well briefed on Soviet philosophy ad lu fara up heir

noses al lhe RFF material.

The Count (and dersten appears to agree)

feels thal lhe Soviel population has more sophisticaied philosophical

material thrown at them by their own Government, and that it sbould be an.
