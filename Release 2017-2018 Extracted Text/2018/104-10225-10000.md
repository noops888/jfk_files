i. The University of the Saar was creatad on 8 March 19h7.
It has four facilities -- two in Saarbrucken (Letters and Law)
and two in Hombourg (Medicine and Sclence), Faculty members are
French, German, Swiss, British and Saaroia.

2. A number of "institutes" exist with undofined relations
to the University though financed, as is the rest of tho University,
by the French Government, and include a special institute for
interpreters, an institute for economic science, and a European
Institute, The support of the French Government of thie University,
aside from its merits, 49 part of the French attempt to Europeanize
the Saar,

3+, he European Institute, devoted to European unity, 4s a
recent creation and 4s largely the result of the promotions of
former Deputy, Andre Philip. It was the European Inatituts ts
which the Herald Tribune article Specifically refers,

4. The University participated extensively, enpecially the
European Institute, in the European Youth Campaign. Some of the
Specific activities were as follows:

March 1952: ‘The Campatyn cooperated with the International
Institute of the University of Sarrabruck In arranging a

meeting of young professors in the Saar and another meeting
of youth leaders, both to discuss furopean problems. Filme

were supplied by the Campaign for both these meetings.

By the end of April, 25 youth organizations (practically all)
in the Saar were associated with the Campaign. During April,
May, and June an extensive program of discussion groups was
arranged in the secondary schools throughout the Saar. These
Broups were sponsored Jointly by the Campaign and the youth
groups of the Saar. The groups discussed all phases of the
unity question but concentrated particularly on the Schuman


Plan due to the economic position of the Saar in this
matter, Films and publications of the Campaign woro used
in the discussions, 7000 students participated.

During June 1952, in cooperation with the Campaign, students
and professors of tha International Institute formed a
Counittes along with youth leaders to discuss the particular
Problems of the Saar in a United Europo.

On March 27, 1952 the Campaign held a large study group in

cooperation with tha European Institute of tho University

of the Saar. Students attended from Aix, tlanbourg, Oxford,

however, for your information and in order to enable you to answer
questions which may be ralaad by Moscro. Dolboaro or Miller, I want
to explain to you how the IO Divieion is presently handling exile

3. We have taken tho following action to try to insure
orderly efforts _to fuse or coordinate the various oxile activitles

aonducted

&@ This division has asked the concerned area divisions
to initiate plans for reorganization and unification of
each national council. ‘The resultant psper is then
coortinated with the proper authoritios in State and a final

Line is agreed upon.

organication is asked for comments, criticisms and
saggestienss

To date two such policy directives havo boea written.

3. I think that Radio Free furope nas maintained excellent disci-
pling on this subject. You can inaglne that it is under vonsiderable
pressure from Iron Ourtain emigration to take tho line of arly ropa
for liberation in the srospect that in sone way Auertoan oubile opinion

partion of thia tino waa dovoted to a bricfini by Lang of tho NCE
stricture and the position which RFE occuploo in it, dncludin; the
philosophy of RFE oparations, Lang gave an impressive performance
and struck mo on such ahort acquaintance aa an individual of ability,
Judgment, and energy.

2. Hr. Lang made quite a point of the fact that his opuration
Anaide NCE 10 virtually independent, tle intimated that he receives
no guidance from the President or other officers and hay exponded
considerable effort;in the past seoing to 1t that aon iron curtain ta
Kopt between RFE and the top commaral of NCKR. lo uald that 4f RFE
had not developed arid expanded according to a philosyphy which it
Ateolf had oriyinated, it would have got nowhere and vould still bo
frustrated by shot he kept referring to aa the "old State Department

Br. Ywaden and coupahy ore concerned, to sald that they dealt largely
with Adniral ‘illor ond his inmdiate staff. It was cloar that ho
would prefer to deal directly with Washinnton. le also fecls in-
hibited by the fact that te has to cajole Admiral !iller into pers.
mission to como to Washinyton, he cited as evidence an incident ree
cently when he folt obliged to aak a friend in the State Departinent to
intercede with Adairal iller to perait him to como down hore for

3. There was nothing bitter or frustrated in Hr, Lang's re-
marks, Father he struck me as an individual who was discussing the

he had received from listenors in Poland and these, together with his
own enormous enthusiasm for tho work he is doing, reminded ine that our
long days in Washington have an effect on tie Lives and hopes of people
far away. Howak, wio was in the Polish resistance during the war and
on one of his three escapes from Poland at one time spent several
eeks in Switzerland where he had made contact with your representative
later worked for the 330 and ho painted out that at no tine during the

‘ riven to feel ty SC the sonse of responsibility and

he was brought to RFE that the responsibility ior the programs was his
and that if at any time programs went on the air which were irresponsible,
then he wowld lose his job. ‘le says that when he has questions which
he thinks might influcnes. t ates policy, he confers beforehand
with and the Anericans in Nuniea, and tines argments ensue,
but he feels, and I an certain te fects sincerely, that ho bas an equal
share with Americans in a great effort to carry the truth back hone.

3. I say "terribly" inporta:t because Nowak, Like othar exiles,

agrend upon in programing conferaicos botwea: the Anerican and exile
statis. the reasons why the broadcasts aro not real by Anoricans
bofore they go on the air are as follows:

&» Besauso tho natural inclination of Avoricans 18 to-
ehange tho troadcasts, and such changes, 2%F officiala feal,
ere likely to.lessen the *gonuino" quality of oxile broad.
enets for the listeners. :

be Bocmece the exiles fool thassolves to be patriots
working for their countries, and the sutmission of scripts
to Ancricann before they are brordcast would be regarded by
the oxiloo aa casting doubt upon their cllogtance and fsrvor.

Tha American staff bolieves that it can exercios policy sontral by
suggestions during progran discus:dona rather than by saking dole-
tions and corrections in the scripty thaisolves.

3. Wo doubt RFc hae made the atstakes kr. mentions in

the ease of crossing it, and the Czechoslovakian ecurroney devaluation.
On the first point, Yr. ldateo are in error, for fiFE did not

1. Whon this Division was delogated the responsibility of
conducting CIA relations with NCFE it was, immediately apparent that
@ variety of problems existed which mado effective action on the
part of IO Division difficult if not Ampoasible, These difficulties

may be yenerally summarized as follows:

(2) The attitude of the responsible officials of NCFE

was one largely of non-cooperation in terms of NCFE



_
10 Division has attepted to solve the above problems by ay

ite’ responsibilities

2. In am attenpt to properly discharge

3e If 10 Division is to ouceed in its task, which in our opinion

is well begun, two conditions are imouncopinton essential:
(1) That there be a single point of liaison between NCFE .

and CIA and that /
:

- (2) That NCFE clearly understands with whom they are to deal in

Free Czechoslovskiu, in turn, channeled some of this Support to

1, Admiral Miller will call upon the PDCI soon to request,
more funds for the Crusade for Freedom, At the prosunt rate of
expenditure, funds will run out on 31 December.

2. was budgeted for the Crusade this year, Wo

havo tol ral Miller that since the Crunado was unable to

live within this budget, wo were certain that the Agency would
appropriate mre money to wind 1t up, although wo have explained
that his aa embarrassing because the PRC had expressly.
approved instead of a larger amount in tho boliof that
less moi be expended this year, We have naked Admiral

Miller to provide us with a financial statement of tho Crusade
cost to date as well asa breakdown of the further amount needed,

3. The Crusade this year has go far cost only a quarter of
last. year's expenditure and half of the amount exponded in 1950,
Receipts are up, 140% over last year at this date. On the whole,
a much better job has teen done to date than wo antlelpated ==
and purely in terms of the amount raised the performance has

been superior,

eople in th York office talk-about {9 the payment of

to who worked for approximately one month
f drawing up a Dimes for Freedom campaign which, as you recall,
rejected as a basis for this year's campaign. :

5. No accounting of Crusade funds oxpended in the field haa
ever been made, and in a fund-raising campaign 1t 1s porhapa
impossible to do so. Nevertheless, rocorde involving payments
for expense mney to private citizens ongaged, for the duration of
the campaign are chaotic. You will recall that Sponcer Phenix,
Treasurer of, NC7E, refuses to have anything to do with expenditures

for the Crusade,

6, Since.we are winding up the Crusade this year and will
attempt to:place it’on a more reliable basis through tha Heritage
Foundation, I suggest that you assure Admiral Miller that funds
sufficient to wind up the Crusade will be forthcoming and that. you
Anetruct the 19 Division’to expedite a prolect granting these
funds, I further suggest that in view of the allegations above,
which I repeat for your private background information, you keep the
position of tha Agency faultless by requesting from Admiral Miller
a budget in an mich detail as possible for the amount necessary to
liquidate the Crusade,

Dear Dareys

Thda io in reference to your telopionc call of this afternoon,
T have just had a Mull report on the natter of the seten vieitore.

Tan afraid you hava gut yourself on the hock on wile one und
motiing can be Gone about it except to go through with the bargain
you made, ‘This bargain, thy documents indicute, was to bring the
Sevan Guecho over here and take the responsibility you assumed when
you signed tie seven coclarations of supecrt affidavits.

Now having gotten thas bud news off ry chest, ¢ hasten to add
that I co not think taie is coing co be ourcensoms to you. You are
doing a read poblic service, as I shall explain in a mosent, and all
of us will do our level dost to heln y :

T wealige thav you did not think you vero assucing the responsi-
bility for veven people. It be cloar, hauever, that overyoue alse
thought you were, anc I think it ts sizply 220 late ta chanze It now,
The Couch regime 1s attacking the United States for ita oandling of
enisreas it te uttacking tie cans which you nave seen; 1t is pointing
up the General hopelessness of an amivre's lot ani tne dullnose and
drvariness Water you have noted at first hand. fais litela tric of
gar seven friends has se> ali the refuses cireles in Geramy goeniping.
Tt 1a exciting news. It'is undoubtedly know: Sehind tw tein, To
call it off now would rake a real cifrerenca -- not tuzt in terre of
tho Crusade. but in tarags of wnat rafageen think adoct tia United
Statoa and united States att:

The rrocedwe from n2¥ on Beans to lay itself ont ss follows:
The seven refugees will arrive somet: curing the = of ecenber,
Thais arrival dato ta imortant. {593 has cate ever effort to
expedite it so tint they ean cone in Necesher, and overwolning
Fessons aught to dictate a rostzonen: They will go to work and do
whatever you, Clyde and So5d want th ¢9 on behaly of the Crusade,
After their work for tne Crusade ia a all sever less will
wish to remain in tha United States @ Wi12 all thea saintly try
&) Pind jobs and places far then, The visas are goo! entil next
Anril, but if they can zind j2d9 here it wiil prubdasly be rossible
for es to secure special legislation for thes ta stay an indefinitely.



How as to the cwass.sne you raise in your lotter of tioveubor 2hth.
Th National Cormitces for a Free Luroe should oercaiuly look after
thene pecnlo when they arrive und witle they are ie axcent insofar
as they arc dizscwe by you vo take un certain activitles ou beralf of
the Creude. The National Countttes sould also cooperate in trying to
balp you in sour efiort to find Jobe ior tien wien their tour 1s aver,
apd I um suro the people thera will do thel” boat. 1 an sending a
cory of thin note to. Nattngy ail T know that he will cooperate ta
ts fullest,

Ag to your secciai question, I trink tho expuneos of all seven
ought to be paid for out of Crusade funds, They are over nere on
beialf of the Crusade amd you aru the one wao asked thes to com,

On the thing quastion, ao I indicated above, L tutnk it would
be a grent blow to vuliod ftatey pulicles in this Meld if they were
w turn erovad alter their duties were over anu Liap dack to a dusty

T thin thie 1g the. way the wnole ting ought to rest now and I

alco against BBC... Batellite language program jomming began”firet
fron Russian stations end thon from jamsing statione located in the
Satellites propor. When RFE transmisotona began in 1950, the
organization and equipment vere available for the new target.

At the present tine, the organization for jamming - ineluding
the transmitters, the monitoring stationa to watch for the undesired
programs, and the control network to direct the jammoro to the target -
i{e apparently integrated throughout the Bloo, with a certain amount

of cooperation between countries. That 19, programs directed. to ong

Batellite country may be Jammed not only from within the country but
from Rusoia and from neighboring Satellites.

At least come of the Jamsers aro closely controlled co that
efforts to evade them by changeo in frequency or achedules are frequently
met by & prompt reaction on the part of the jeamer -- within a minuto

or less. .
Ghe extent of integration of the total Bloc jamming system makes

4t very diffioult to ceparate the effort contributed within the Satellites.
Hovever, it 10 prenentiy eotinated that about 900 transmitters are in

the jamming effort within the Bloo, and these appear to be fairly vell
@tetributed throughout the total of the frequencies that are being used

at ony given time. Therefore, at times vien RYE 10 broadcasting to

the Satellite countries vith & cousiderable number, of frequencies, there
are undoubtedly. hundreds of .trenanitters Jaming these frequencies.

that jamming 1s moot effective in large citiest approaching 100%.
In rural ereas, tho picture varies Trou time to time and from place

1, On 2 September, representatives of RFE and VOA net with
Ambassador Joseph Flack and solicited his comments on reported
unrest in Foland, and the utility of KFE and VUA Polish dbroadcastée

2. With reference to internal disturbances and partisan -
activities, Plack stated that there have been "absolutely none”

tha Juae uprisings in Eaat Gormany were proved to have been without
foundation as a result of relatively unrestricted survey action
then taken by numerous representatives of (, Se, British and French
diploaatié Riesions in:Poland. He oxnressed hie convictios that
there ig-no eignifieant underground organisation in Poland which ©
might be considered as an immediate assat Ly the “est, and enpha-
aised his belief that serious disturbances would not occur as long
as the present Soviet control mochanis: retains itg power and the
Soviet arsies in Poland and East Gernany ro unchallenged, The
bitter lessons of World War IT, particalarly the abortive Naraay
uprisings, anc leck.of confidence in tte Tolish emigration defin=
tely discourage active resistance. The foles increasingly tend to
Fesent tha action of the enirre leaders, revarding then asse::tially

asset froa resistance ag 4 potential assst. Ke expressed the
belief that the Catholic Chirch atill cffers the strongest ard the
best organised base of resistance in Poland as it is looked upon

this he added nis own appreciation for traditional Polish spirit
of indepencence and Christian orientation, and e=phasized his
belief that folish hatred of Kussians and ecommunien continues to

THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON

Soptomber 17, 1953

Miss McCrum:

Thave a feeling that no one on our side is propared to keep a firm hand
on tho Jean Paul David trip.

David is himaelf a king-size froe wheeler. Although be is unqueoticnably
one of the French “doers,” as opposed to "talkers," in thia field, be

is also-quito a big-mouth and inclined to over-talk, over-promiae and over-
indulge in cloak-and-dagger stage setting. U he hasn't got a guard, armed
to the teeth, with a beret and a half-burned cigarette glued to hie undorlip,
lurking outside the diniag-room, he can't enjoy hig meal. :

I would suggest that you show the attached to Abbott Washburn, George
Morgas, Tom Braden and/or Bill Durkee, and Joo Phillips (alse thio note) ©
and suggest that they work out whoshould consider himself reaponeible.

T personally hope Joe Phillips will be willing to take it on.

Incidentally,
She might c ratted a3 chaperone for thie trip.

c.D.J.



COPY

The following is {rom a dispatch written by Me. William Tyler, dated

22 Juno 1953.

1. After a recent coaversation with Jean Paul David, at which time he
outlined hie activities and ideas in connection with the mission with which
he 19 charged by Georgos Bidault, I received a letter from him,

2. It will be seon from this letter that David is most anxious that the
roport which he will make on his survey should reprosent, ‘without committing
any one Country, a systhesis of the views and the resources of the Western
Powors allied under NATO, in the broad field of propaganda and psychological
warfare designed to build support for Western defense policy and te promote :
the achlevement of the odjoct:ves of these palicies,

y which we-have to face, and which we
are probably unique in having to face; is due to the organisational otructurs
within which we oparate officially ia the general field under discussion. - fe
@ country like Italy, for oxamplo, it is possible for David to have exchanges
of views with high officials of.the-government and to feel reasonably sure
that even though euch views are not to be taken ag 9 commitment, they do in fact H
represent the disposition af the government in question, or any government
likely to suceéed it, toward these problems. In our case, however, it seemo
fo me that it will require carefcl préparation to determine with whore David
should consult and to work out a constructive position which will influence
his report asd hie recommendations ina direction which we approve,

3. It ocdiire to me that'a difficult

4. It i particularly difficult for mo to make epecific recommendations,
since developmenta in Washington in the last few months are difficult to 1 i
keep up with fram overseas. It would, therefore, be particularly helpful
to-have headquarters! views at this stage on the following points, assuming
that David. will go tothe States in late September on the last leg of hia survey:

a. With whom should he meet for basic diseusuions. (It occurs to
me that a suitable body, if sf ill in existence, would.ie the Psychological
Operations Coordinating Cammittes.) :

b. Within what limits at this time are we prepared to discuss the
Problem of concerted action for the psychological strength of the North i
Atlaatic Community.

5. Aa headquarters is aware, C. D. Jackson knows David personally,
and it would perhaps be useful to arrange for conversations with hin onc

Sny group he might have in mind.:. It is true that the positiea of David
|i9 anomalous, since the survey on which he {6

engaged, | | ie of the most official



vuaOl

Kind possible, As headquartere has pointed out, his intereste-in hie present

mission In reality pertain more to the State Department and NATO than

- to ug, and it m8 to mo that we should not be in the direct lino af fire
except in the capacity of individual observera or participants in the
conversations he will haj ‘Tt would, therefore, seem to be all the more
important that wo arrivo } clear undorstanding among oursclves as to
how David's trip to the States will be organised and what e to ba the
respective role of the component olamonts in the psychological effort with
regard to his survey,

Memorendum for the Kecord

Subject: Conversation with Congressman Kereten
e

1, On & May Congressman Kersten addreased a letter to the
State Department, enclosing a letter dated 6 May 1953, which he had
received (rom Mr, Creighton Scott, a former employce of Radio Free
Europe at Munich, Germany, Thia letter was highly critical of cer=
tain personnel in RL, particularly as regards allegations of pro-com-
munist attitudes.” On 6 July I discussed these criticisms with Congress-
man Kersten in detail, conveying to him orally-the materinl coniained |
in the memorandum of 17 June 1953 {rom the Director of Security; Subject:
Inquiry by Congressman Kersten; which the Director of Security had noted
should de utilized in thia meeting with Congressinan Kersten, :

2, The Congreseman noted the difficulty in evaluating the type of
criticisms which Mr, Scott had made but appeared willing to accept our
explanation, ry

3. Pie ainein aR then. turned to certain criticisins which
he had heard expressed regarding RFE from several sources, including

Scott, One such criticism is that RFF is nd doing the best :t should on

the broadcasis could

religious programs, He feels that this aspect o
probably be considerably strengthened, particularly among Catholic :

elements,

4. Mr. Kersien cited the opinion of Count Tarnuwski (sp. 7), a well
known Pele, who told the Congressman that any fourteen year old Soviet
citizen would be ao well briefed on Soviet philosophy us to tara up their
hoses at the RFE material. ‘he Count (and Seraten appears to agree)
(cele that the Soviet population has more sophisticated philosophical
material thrown at them by their own Government, and that it should be an
important function of RFE to counter with an attempt to destroy the Soviet
philosophical material and shake the Soviet faith in their theoreticians.

5. Congressman Kersten realized that it is difficult to capwuré &
wide audience with philosophical arguments, but he.fee!s that if these
arguments reached a segment of important leaders behind the Iron Curtain,
it would halp to destroy and counter the philosophical! teachings of Marx,
Lenin, etal. The Congressmen feels that many of our broadcasts deal

cwith economic matters, and, while these are important, RFE should go’ _



deeper and hit harder on religion and philosophy,

6. While Congresoman Kersten is-aware that many of the
captive population are not interested in righteat movements, it is
his opinion that RFE cannot beat communiom with socialiam. In
particular, he felt (and Scott bore this out in their conversation)
that we were making too much use of Czech socialiats, and we were
using soctaliete from the Bence Government which had sought to
compromise with the communists, While he recognizes the popu-
larity of Benes and Mauaryx in Czechia, he feels they are not el-
fective in Slovakia, where there is a hoavy Catholic population.

7. Congressman Kersten plans to go to Eurype, probably
in September. While he did not say ov, I believe he would welcome
an invitation tu visit RFE, Munich, Furthermore, as the author of
the Kersten Amendment end of several resolutions on the enslaved
Peoples; at leaat one of which may receive Congressional approval
at this session, consideration right be given aa to whether it would
be advisable t> requeat the Congressmen to utilize RFE facilities
to broadcast while he ts abrzad, :

April 1, 1953

To 26 Dear Adolf,

A day cr two vofore I sailed for Surope in Jamary, 1953, I received
a typed mamuscript copy of tho "Progress Report on the Colloge de 1'Zurepe
Ltbre", which has now appeared in mimoogaphed form under date of February
27,1953, over the signatures of Royall Tyler and Aichard Sears)

I admit to considerable curiosity when this decunont appoared. In
the covering letter Royall Tyler morely stated, "It comes fron Dick Sears",

i I rather wondered why thia report should be compiled when {t waa) known I was
i coming to Surope presumably to examine into condittons and it seemed to me ; |
i immediately that this night.be a counter foll to what it was expected I '
{ would find. In reply to a direct inquiry from re, Sears nov states it was

prepared "to reinforce the German languago ur project by supplying informa~
i tion that was apparently lacking.

So, while the factual material in this report can not be questi onéd
— I mean the statistics and the historical portions — the interpretation of \
_then doos not raf,

\
ect the disappointing results. This pertains to the work
of the Comaittee on Awards on the one hand and

On tho same pags again, fifth lino fron the betton, the phrase "the
severity of the action taken in tho autumn has had a salutary effoct|in

The manner in whichthe action was taken, and tho inaccuracy af sore of the
Judgments, whickhad to te reversed, called forth protests from staff land stu-

On Page 16, the last sentence in tho first paragraph roads, "A fresh
start in lifo combined with exposure to Western thought ard practice will, we
are encouraged to hope, produce a full return." Instead of what tho statement
implias, the atudenta havo witnessed a.cleavago between tte European staff and
tho Americans, == and the "exposure to Wostern thougltaré practice” has beon
anything but inspiring-or unifying.

- You my bo interested in a dispateh which I received hore: 8

couple of days ago and watch I quote as follows:

"On January lb, Alexander Booker of the German Forelyn Office
informally brought to our attention a map of Eastern Europe
wich spveared in the December tasue of "News from Behind the
Iroc Curtain", a monthly periodical published by the "National
Comittee for a Fred Europe”. Tais map which is ahown in 5
snslt seale on paze 1 of thie periodical, shows oll of Eastern
Gernasy, including East Pruseia, tie Satellite States, and tho
former Jaltic States, In the case of the formor Gorman terri-~
tories east of tho Sder-Helese line, tie area is simply showm
as telorging to Poland, and ite creewar borders are not sot
off by a dotted line, With reazee. to Poland, Caechoslovakia
snd iomania, however, the territsries that were annexed by

the soviet Union during or after iorld War IT are clearly
marked by a dotted line. Furthermore, the Eastern Zone of
Qernacy as well ag Zast Prussia are anown in the same colors
a tia Soviet Union, whereas the Baltic and Satellite States

are sown in white,

"Altroegh Booker adritted that the man itself was not of great
impertance, he sovertheless pointed out that it represents

‘a typical oxamle of the one-eided anti-German propaganda’
put. not only by the National Comittee for a Free Europe
but also by Haclo Free Europe, Sue% propaganda, he said, can
only increase the misyivings which many Germans, particularly
the reiugees, already entertain with respect to the activities
of ina committee and on:the cperatisns-.of Radto Free Eurape on :

Germ. soil. / |
comma

|

| [A more constructive and objective propaganda policy
of 29 comalttee and Fadio Free Eurme along the lines of a
larger Suropean Community that would embrace Poland and Csecho-
slovacia as well as a-reunited Germany and the other European
natiocs would not only contribute to a bettie underatand ing

between the various refugee elements but would also havo
tho full support of all Gernias, Bookor added." aad

Ineidentally, I think you are dots an awfully good Job on this
Kind of thing. Tho other night T actually read throwh an entiro
Conye |

Tho article on muste for the nasses and the general axroge of
the attack on the arts 49 particuiariy sienifieant, f think, Until
the recent anti-semitisa, tiis {16.2 of culture is the one field of
Soviet activity in wiich they were wslnerablo before Aeutralists and-
fallov-travclors everywhere, ‘The tencancy of the intellectual to
Swalloy the Soviet line on culture, to fall for the Stalin Prises,
the high statua accanied tha obedient intolleotual in Sortet socloty,

Zand pseudo-selontific apneal of the Surxian doyna of equality ta
cangeroug. Ina iree society, the istellectual is the origin ef

ideas,

Anything ve can do to show the fact that avory asraet af Soviet
culture has becn transformed into an instrument.of the State, that
the intellectualts rola 1s iymortant scaly co long as he is obedient,
tiat in fact tho product of the Soviss artist would not hold a candle
to the standards eet. by fellow-trovelin; circles in Vestam Surope,
and that tho. Soviet has earrupted the ccinciples of equality on which
it presumes to stand is terribly imarcant. :

T am suro you are avare of all the above bub I thought af it:
when I read tho piece in the last issce, and my comment ts just
anothor way of telling you what a goal Job I think you are doing.

CHUSADE FOR FRYEDOM

1790 CAMPAIGN:

1. Tho Crusade was. launched by Gonoral Dwight D.-Eisenhower.on a
nation wide broadeast. \

2. The syabol of tho Crusade, a ten ton World Frowdon Sell, inscribed
with a quotation from Lincoln, “This World undor Gal oball havo a now birth
of freedom", toured the United St:tec from coast to.evust. The "Frodo
Bell" was cent to Berlin to become part of a "Freedom Shrino", and tolled
there over, an international radio hookup.

- 3s Freedom Scrolls signed by 15,000,000 contrizutors were taken to
Berlin to become a permanent part of the Froodom Enrine.

4. In the United States, local committoos were established throughout
the eountry. General Lucius Clay was appointed chairman of the Fund raieing.

1951 CAUPALGN

Tho 1951 Crusade Canpaign waa begun by tho launching cf balloons into
Czechoslovakia and Poland containing pamphlets of encouragement to the people
of these countries. Copies of the message and samples of the balloons wore
used %o solicit contributions in the United States. Publicity dealt largely
with Radio Fre Europe. Free magazine advertising wes widely used for the
first time. A coast to coast telethon-was used.

Inadvertently, through mistakes of the staff ani the failure to adequately
brief community leadors, the Crusade mistakenly inplied that the Voice of
America was ineffective -- that only Radio Free turope, the privately supported
radio broadcasting station, could do an effective job.



After conferences with the State Department, it. ms agrood that VOA
and RFE wore complinentary activities and that-in the future the Crusades

(1) Would not put-out anything which might be interpreted:
ae a critioiam of the Volee, To that ond, an attached leaflet
was inserted as an insert in the Junuary l9$? "Crusader", a
newsletter mich was sent out to the 8,000 regional chairman
of tho Crusade for Frocdom. It wag intended to acquaint the
regional Cruoade organisations with tno facts absut the Voloe
". Of Aworioa and to offset any critictan or unfortumte comparison
-  botween Radio Free Europe andthe Voice of America.

the plans of the Crusade for Freedom to build nore radio stations
in Free Europe and Asia. If this can te done, ami l believe that it
will be done, the Free world can nore offeotively get the truth
behind the Iren Curtain. ~

"It ie ossential that the people everywhere know that we aro
working for poace, freedom and prosperity for all mankind."

Tho assistue of the Advertising Council was enlisted and for tho
first time outdoor billboard advertising waa used. Recards were made con=
taining 2 fiftcen minute progra:s on.“The KFE story" and epot films were
arranged for television witn narration by Henry Fonda.

Por the first time, fund raiviug letters secking large contributions
Were sort to all leading corporatioria. :

The Campaign was highly organised on the local level with state chairmen
in almost every state. The Post Office Department permitted the use of a luca)
