“1. Reference is 2 telephone conversation of
24 Jamary between Mr| f this Division and Mr, R, H,
Cunningham of your S: +“Cunningham stated that an

inquiry had been made by the FEI relative to subjects! con-
tinued availability to official U.S. agencies for purposes”
of giving testimony on Communist Party beedarht sien hich the :
Shame acini of a agencies. 3 7

“2.0 "As "you know, subject has signed a contract with this:
‘Division for a two year tour of duty in the field. It is not'¢
the desire of the Western Hemisphere Division to recommend the
complete withdrawal of his services fron other official interes’
‘although it is of course preferable that such instances be held
to an absolute minimm. We do recommend however, that the FBI
be officially advised that future requests for subject's neces-
sary services or testimony be made only through CIA channels,
and that this Division be requested to make him available for
such purposes. It is felt that subject's cover is sufficient
to withstand the scrutiny which could reasonably be expected to
result fron sublicity incident to such activities.-
