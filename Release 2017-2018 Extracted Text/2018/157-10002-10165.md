Mr. Schwarz. Did you know Jack Ruby?

Mr. Phillips. No, I did not.

Mr. Schwarz. Do youknow him under the name of Ruben-
stein?

Mr. Phillips. I did not.

Mr. Schwarz. What did you do between your work in Cuba
and the Chile matter which you weré going- to: spend most of your
time on?

Mr. Phillips. After the Bay of Pigs business I went to
Mexico in late in 1961, and remained in Mexico until the very
early part of 1965, when I was assigned to the Dominican

Republic

Mr. Schwarz. And then --

Mr. Phillips. I stayed in the Dominican Republic until
the summer of 1967. < .

the Chief of Cuban Operations through 1969.

In 1970 I went to Rio de Janiero And

in 1971, I suffered the traumatic shock of being moved to

Brasilia from Rio de Janiero. see

or the other which would enable you to form a judgment as
to his attitude toward either the subject of assassination or
the question as to what kind of an explicit order would be
necessary in order to justify Agency actions to actually
assassinate some one.

Mr. Phillips. No, because I never heard Mr. Helms even
get that close to the edge of such talk about such and such an
option or possibility, I never heard him talk that way.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever hear anybody in the Agency
talk that way?

Mr. Phillips. Under traumatic conditions I have heard
human beings maybe with a few drinks or something like that
saying, my God, we would be better off if so and so were
bumped off or something.

But I have never heard two officers sit down and
seriously talk about such an option. And if anyone has ever
said that, it is the same way some people might get out of line
and say almost anything.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever hear, in connection with
the Chile operation, that certain Chilean officers, specifi-

cally a Major Marshall that they intended

to assassinate Allende?

Mr. Phillips. It was five years ago. But as I recall,
Major Marshall said a-number of things. He was what I think

of as a wild man. I seem to recall something about, yes, a

Mr. Schwarz. And you offered through(colonel Wimery,
whom we will come to in a moment, $50,000 if they could
accomplish it, didn't you?

Mr. Phillips. I think that was the correct sum, yes.

mr. Schwarz. And you gave them prior to their attempt
on the 19th of October some tear gas and some gas masks to
help accomplish the kidnapping?

Mr. Phillips. That is true.

Mr. Schwarz. And subsequently you provided to the Val-
enzuela group some machine guns, didn't you?

Mr. Phillips. That is ture.

Mr. Schwarz. ~ And those were going to be used ina
kidnapping effort by the Valenzuela group, and you knew that,
didn't,you?

Mr. Phillips. I recall that they were going to be
used by’the group, and that kidnapping was a part of their
plans. I can't recall that they said they needed them spe-
cifically for the kidnapping. I do recall that the reason was -+
the automatic reaction from Latin America is, why do people
need arms when they have got arms everywhere all over Latin
America.

And they said something about, their own arms could be
identified, and they needed some that couldn't be identified.
I don't recall if it was specifically mentioned: that’ it was

just for that. It was certainly understood that they might

Consequently, I personally made this Proposal, that we
establish what I called a false flag base of people that would
go from outside, and should there be any sort of flap, the |
chances of linking it to the U.S. Government would be much
less, because they would appear to be from another nationality. |

Mr. Schwarz, I would like to read to you a cable -- is i
this cable of 27 September in the Senator's. book? I know that
he asked for it after I came over.

Mr. Treverton. It is not.

Mr. Schwarz. I am going to read from a cable which
unfortunately is not in your book, but the key part is
relatively simple.

This is a cable, Mr. Phillips, dated September 27, 1970,
and it is signed by yourself and Mr. Broe. And it is sent to
the Station in Chile, and it contains the following about the
Purposes of setting up the false flag office --

Mr. Phillips. We call it a base.

Mr. Schwarz. False. flag bases: "Each member of base
will enter and leave Chile with falst documents and operate as
a representative of his country rather than as anAmerican",

That is right, isn't it?

Mr. Phillips. That is true.

Mr. Schwarz. Continue:

"Having at least one key{ and one key

would be vital, and we have candidates."

And you did that.
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Mr. Schwarz. And then it goes on as follows: "These

officers will perform the delicate shows with great flap
potential which cannot be done by Station personnel or any
Chilean." i

That is right, isn't it?

Mr. Phillips. That is true.

Mr.Schwarz. And by flap potential you meant exposure?

Mr. Phillips. Contacting screwballs such as Marshall,
that sort of thing.

Mr. Schwarz. But generally pursuing the Track II
activities?

Mr. Phillips. That is right.

Mr. Schwarz. Continuing: “An example. We have can-
didates who can successfully pose as[____ )intelligence
officers." You did that, didn't you? ¥

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And this goes on: “If he approached, funded

and ran a Chilean General, any flap would be al

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. So the scheme was that not only would

the U.S. not be blamed, but other countries like houla
be blamed if something went wrong.

Mr. Phillips. Yes, this is particularly sensitive to me,

However, that was it. It was a

devious move. It was the final result -- the idea being that
if such a flap did occur, someone would think it was someone
other than the U.S. The idea of false flag operations is
not a new one. The idea I had of going to someone ana saying,
why don't you be a spy for us, I don't work for the Soviets,
is not true.

But this is sort of new, the fact that action agents
should pose as others. And yes, it is devious, but that
was the idea.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Phillips, what were
their instructions if they were to be caught? Were they to go
to their death swearing they were[~—idig whatever?

Mr. Phillips. I don't think it was quite that dramatic,
Senator. They came to Washington before they went down. And
I briefed them,and I think what =I said to them was, this
is going to be a toitigh and sensitive one, and you don't have
to go if you don't want to, because you culd get in real trouble.

And if you get in trouble, I am not sure we .can help

you.
So, they shrugged their shoulders and went.

as Cl were approached?

Mr. Phillips. It never occurred to us in our wildest
dreams to do that.

Mr. Schwarz. I suppose the relationships between con-
tinuing intelligence services were things that were
very: important to preserve, and that we had very press and
delicate relationships with the otheriintelligence services.

Mr. Phillips. We do. And if there had been such a

man{ would be quite unhappy with us. But I

thought that was better than letting the world know that was

a U.S. Citizen down there.

Mr. Schwarz. You go on in the cable of September 27
to say this:

“Headquarters believes this false flag was manned by
officers who have repeatedly proved their ability to operate
and recruit under false colors, will give Station great flexi-
bility in handling delicate and fast-moving situations secure-
ly."

So, the use of false flag persons, at least judging

from this cable, is something

Mr. Phillips. Yes, and by all intelligence services --
not all, but all major intelligence services. If you are living
overseas and a man comes up to you and’says, hey, I see you
are a Marxist, and a man comes up and says, I am from Havana

and we would like you to work with the Cuban intelligence

service, he might not be from Havana, he might be from the

So, it is not an unusual practice.

Mr. Schwarz. Incidentally, you just let drop one thing
in your testimony a moment ago. You said that in your 25-year
involvement with intelligence matters you had been bothered
by your activities on only two occasions, one of which was
Chile.

And then you said what the other one was. What was that?

Mr. Phillips. I was in Washington attending the Chiefs
of Station course, which is a training course for people who
are going out on their first assignment as Chief of Station.

When President Johnson decided to send 22,000 Marines
to the Dominican Republic, it occurred to me that in order to
Protect and evacuate American citizens, that that job might

have been done with 400 Marines. I was scheduled to go there

{ And I just wasntt sure that I

wanted to be associated with something like that. But I de-
cided, well, I suppose President Johnson knows what he is
--doing, I will go -- I am going to go along. So, I did go
along.

Senator Schweiker. One question on your differentiation
between where you drew a personal commitment line on assassin-
ations, but not overthrow. I have trouble quite understanding

it, because as I understand Chile, the plot was to overthrow

Mr. Phillips. There is no question that I could under-
stand why anyone concerned with world affairs, looking at
Chile and what was happening there, would be concerned.

Salvadore Allende made his first statement saying that
he was a Socialist and wanted to change the order some 32
years beforehe was elected.

Over the years he made it quite clear that he was an ar-

dent socialist. Before this decision was made I believe that

we had a visit from a man who had the code name of,

was a Cuban intelligence officer.- The Cubans were moving in
rapidly. The influence was great. I think that they saw a lot
at stake, another Cuba in Latin America type of thing, the
same thing perhaps that motivated President Johnson to send
22,000 rather than 400.

So,I can understand why they thought this was going,
in the long strategic sense, in the long range against our
interests. But that is an assumption.

It is true that Allende very definitely made it clear
that he wanted to turn Chile into a Marxist state. The differ-
ence was that Allende refused to take Fidel Castro's advice
and use violence. As I understand it, Fidel Castro went to

Chile and said, if you want your revolution to last you are

going to have to use violence.
I found it interesting to read in this morning's paper

where someone from Portugal came back from Cuba and said,

six or seven weeks for what we are referring to as Track II.
Senator MOndale. Now, in that position you familiarize
yourself with the Chilean government, Allende and 7 on,
and tried to become as expert as you could in the political
forces and so on?
Mr. Phillips. Yes. And in addition to that, Senator,
one of the reasons I was called back was that I had lived
for many years in Chile, so I knew something about it.
Senator Mondale. And it is:your:judgment as I think I
just heard, that although Allende was a Marxist, and espoused
Marxism, he also said he wanted to achieve this through the

democratic process, and although there was some rough stuff

on the press, and so on, essentially that was the course he
was pursuing, is that correct?

Mr. Phillips. I don't recall that he said it, but
he indeed acted that way.

Senator Mondale. But in fact the course he was pur-
suing was an attempt to achieve the Marxist philosophy with
the population support under constitutional system?

Mr. Phillips. Yes, essentially that is true,-sir.

Mr. Phillips. Senator, it doesn't make any difference
today. On the contrary, since Watergate the people say, why
should we? Before Watergate it was another ball game.

The President was the Commander in Chief in every sense of the
word.

And you said, who am I, a GS-15 bureaucrat, to say that
ie shouldn't do this? But that has changed since Watergate.

Senator Hart of Colorado. One other question.

I call your attention in our briefing books to what is
Tab C, a cable which has your name at the end of it dated 21
September 1970, page 3 of 7. Are you an author or co-author
of that cable?

Mr. Phillips. I believe I was the authenticating
officer, yes.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What does that mean?

Mr. Phillips. That meant that the signature on the
right of those cables is someone that is the authenticating
officer in a sense, here is a fellow that is supposed to know
the situation.

Senator Hart of Colorado. But who wrote it, I guess

‘
is what I am after.

written by and perhaps myself, perhaps it was
joint. But| spot an awful lot of them. But by

a part of it. And then, of course, the releasing officer is
the one that accepts the responsibility.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Page 3 of 7 which has
the paragraph identified as the paragraph F contains the follow4
ing sentence or part of a sentence: You suggest sending
us cables outlining objectives and course of events, et
cetera, and he said, always conditioned by the fact that we have
to keep our feet in the mud of practicality, and our eyes

What does that mean in Agency talk?

Mr. Phillips. Senator, I want to assure you with real
seriousness that I am not the author of that phrase.

Senator Hart of Colorado. It must have caught your eye,
however.

Mr. Phillips. It did catch my eye. If this was indeed
a joint venture, I can promise that that |
contribution, and if you ever meet him you will understand
why. He was addicted to picturesque speech. And -.looking
back, all I can say is that it probably went out at four
o'clock in the morning, and we were very tired, and I just
didn't want to argue about that phrase, and I let it go. I
am not sure what it means even now.

witting of the above plan, has promised to keep

abduction will not be interferred with. General Viaux is
knowledgeable of the above operation, but is not directly
involved."

What do you think "not directly involved" refers to?

Why not just not involved?

Mr. Phillips. I think that probably referred to what
I was saying before, that in these situations it is not very
unusual that there is not some talk that everybody has a cousin
that works with some group type of thing.

And I believe that it must refer to that.

Mr. Schwarz. Taking the actual cable, is the actual
cable in the Senator's books?

Mr. Inderfurther. No.

Mr. Schwarz. Let me read the full text of that para-
graph from the cable. It is a cable apparently dated 19
October on the subject of General Viaux:

“General Viaux, knowledgeable of above operation, but not
directly involved. He has been sent to Vina to stay with

meaning that the Valenzuela group and the Viaux group were in
close cooperation, that was part of the abduction Plan, it
was agreed between the two that Viaux would appear -- would
be out of town so that he would not appear to be involved.
And you have to read that, do you not, as meaning an there
was a close cooperation on this effort between the two groups.

Mr. Phillips. Yes, I think you. do have to read it that

that someone recognized the fact that if we had been given the

that someone came and gave me the piece of paper in this book
that has been signed by General Philpott. which was a message
co GERD saying, cooperate with the CIA. What the process
was for getting that approval, or who went to see Philpott:,

I wasn't involved with that, I just don't recall.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever see Philpott ?

Mr. Phillips. I never did.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever see --

Mr. Phillips. I may have seen Philpott in some large
meeting or something like that, but I don't recall any
meeting with any of the generals. I was relatively too junior
to have attended these meetings. This would have been Mr.
Broe, Mr. Karamessines, and so forth. And I would have been
left back in the shop, sort of, I think.

Mr. Schwarz. And did you ever see or talk to Bennett?

Mr. Phillips. Not to my recollection. I think not.

Mr. Schwarz. I asked you if you ever saw General Phil-
pott, or did you ever talk to .General Philpott?

Mr. Phillips. I don't recall such a talk. During this
entire period, for instance, I never went outside of our build-
ing.I was there sort of in the shop. And other people would do

that sort of thing.

Mr. Schwarz. Is that the form in which you sent the
message which is contained in Exhibit 3 to Chile?

Mr. Phillips. It is.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, apparently Exhibit 4, which you
drafted initially, said that it was from General Bennett, and
then it was changed to say it was from General Philpott.

Did you make that change?

Mr. Phillips. That is my handwriting above that said
Philpott, and someone else's handwriting below that said
Bennett. I think the signature on the original document
was from Philpott. But that is my change there.

Mr. Schwarz. And is the change on the second page ~~

the sentence reads:

"Do not allow to retain copy of this
message", and then in handwriting it is asserted "Note that
General Bennett is out of the country".

Mr. Phillips. Yes, that is my handwriting.

Mr. Schwarz. Having seen that, and these changes, what
do you recall about the circumstances that led you to make
those changes?

Mr. Phillips. It'is possible that this message is one
of the rare messages that sometimes occur, that you are handed
something that is written out, and there is no secretary,

and it is two o'clock in the morning or something like that.

On some occasions you will take a very rough draft and ask

I am not sure about that.

Mr. Schwarz. You think what you sent used General Ben-
nett's name and not General Philpott's name?

Mr. Phillips. JI don't recall. But I believe a that had
been the case that not only would the change have been made,
but there would have been some sort of note on the side or
something. So, I believe that the original must have said
Philpott. But I can't be absolutely positive.

Mr. Schwarz. But the original typed version onthe
first page used Bennett's name, right?

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, I am puzzled, because if you had
previously obtained the document which is Exhibit 3, the

"suggested message to be sent from General

Bennett", and which is in fact signed with a:name that
purports to be General Philpott's, if you had obtained that
before drafting the typed message, I take it you would have used
Philpott's name in the typed message and not Bennetts’.

Mr. PHillips. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. So that suggests that you typed the typed

message before you obtained the document which is Exhibit 3

| that has Mr. Philpott's signature?

Mr. PHillips. My answer to that until a few minutes
ago would have been, I don't recall that. I have seen a document,
since then that indicates that someone else was talked to
later. If I knew that I had forgotten it, or perhaps never
knew it -- I must have known it if I saw the message.But
until I saw this thing, to refresh my memory I would have
said, I think that Philpott was the man.

Mr. Schwarz. Was the man, and was only contacted on
that one occasion? wa

Mr. Phillips. As far as I. know, that one occasion.
But I didn't necessarily know what was outside of my little
room with windows, and so there were other people doing other
things.

Mr. Schwarz. And this is a cable releasing officer Williaa:
Broe, authenticating officer David A Phillips, dated Octo-
ber 14, 1970, from CIA headquarters to Santiago, CIA.
And it says:
“Please deliver the following message (‘destroy immedi-

Mr. Phillips. Obviously -- not obviously, but because >

there was a document that was handed to me and I was told,
send this down. In order to make this point, I was in there,
and it was sort of a direct operational thing, and when I
authenticated them I did it because I knew what was going on.
If Bill Broe, my boss, came in and said, here is a document
that we want to send, or if Tom Karamessines said, I worked on
the assumption that they were passing on to me the authority
to authenticate, and I didn't necesarily turn to them and say,
hey --

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And what is your best recollection as to
who handed you that document?

Mr. Phillips. I cannot say definitely who did that.
There were many occasions when Bill Broe would walk into the
office and say, here is something to send. There were others
which would come in a manila envelope with a yellow
forwarding slip on it. There are times,I am sure, when I
would go into Bill Broe's office, and he would say, by the
way, send this.

I simply cannot recall the circumstances - in which some-
one handed me that and said, send it to Chile. And I was paying
less attention to those things, because I was in effect the
postman for people doing other things.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any recollection at all
about this document?

Mr. Phillips. No, I am afraid I don't.

Mr. Schwarz. What is your reading of the signature on
that document?

Mr. PHillips. Well, it certainly looks like the sig-
nature which was on the other document which was said to be

Philpott's. But I am not an authority on these things.

it would appear that theremight be something here where they

not to say to these new people, by the way, we ane to talk

more helpful on this. But I was treating these -- these things
were coming through my mail shoot, and I was putting headings
on them. Even though I signed them and so forth, I wasn't
paying the attention to things that I did to my own job.

Mr. Schwarz. That is an explanation that deals with
some of the earlier documents. But here in the first place
you were both the releasing officer and the authenticating
officer.

And second, this is not simply taking some other message
and putting a heading on it, is it? This is a substantive
document purporting to explain a problem to your CIA Station

Mr. Phillips. Ido not. But I don't think that I --
I don't see myself releasing that cable without being sure that
Broe knew what was going out in that cable. In other words,
that is hthe kind of cable that I wouldn't have released
just because someone else came in and said that sort of thing.
This cable I think must have originated either with a dis-

write up something like this, or perhaps some notes, and say,

do a cable from it, or just as possible -~ and I can't read it

thing else, and they came to me with a typed thing and said,
here, I cleared this with Broe, and so he signed both things.
So I really can't remember.

Mr. Schwarz. Under either assumption, ence that poe
spoke to you directly or that someone on your staff
spoke to Broe, you had Broe around at the time this cable goes

went out -- I can't remember well enough if it was late at

and saying, look, we want you to go along with this and use
@eeionel Wimert down there, he is really important to us, and
that sort of thing, and was perhaps slightly embarrassed
by the fact that they had been doing that before. That is the
only explanation I can give.

Mr. Schwarz. So you would assume that choca new
interested parties and the several persons referred to in
the two sentences are persons who were in higher authority
than Bennett and Philpott?

Mr. Phillips. I assume that, but do not know. I just --
this thing was being so closely held, it just doesn't seem
logical to me that they would start going outside and down,

I thought that they would go outside and up. But I say, I
only assume that.

Mr.Schwarz. You have characterized Exhibit 7 as itself
being sort of puzzling. And the situation it deals with, as
you now describe it, is one that is kind of ticklish, isn't it?

Mr. Phillips. I understand.

Mr. Schwarz. The CIA had been using
some people in higher authority than General Bennett, which
would mean very senior in the Defense Department, right?

of it, General Bennett and General Philpott feel that they are
embarrassed to refute the fact that they had already been doing

the work for the CIA

Now, all those things were not ordinary garden variety
daily events, were they?

Mr. Phillips. They were not.

Mr. Schwarz. You don't remember this at all?

Mr. Phillips. No, and I didn't want to imply that it
was necessarily because General Philpott would have been
embarrassed, it could have been within CIA as well.

But this rather unusual step was made because of the
talents of the military men, to bring him into a program
that you weren't even talking with the State Department about.
And so that indeed was unusual to a great degree. And I am
really very sorry to appear to be so vague about these things
that I obviously had something to do with.

But my explanation is that I was doing a certain job,
and that other’ people were outside, and Mr. Karamessines would
be talking with Mr. Helms about something, and this, that and
the other, and I was on the day-by-day operation side, and when
someone would come in and say, we want something to go down
to Wimert, and it has something to do with General Philpott,

I didn't pay the kind of attention I would to it if it had
been one of our operations.

Background for his information".

Now, there are two ways in which those words "for his
information" can be read. One is that it is the genuine

background.

The other is that it is a story to be given for
his information, which is the fact, if you know, and which way
doyou read it if you do not know what the facts are?

Mr. Phillips. I assume that it is the true story, because
nowhere during this period did I encounter anything, nor do
I remember anything that I thought was devious to the extent
of falsehood in putting something down like that.

So, I assume that it is really for his background of
what happened.

Mr. Schwarz. And you don't remember from where you got

the information which you provided in this cable?
Mr. Phillips. I do not. Perhaps I can be more helpful
after you talk to others. But I simply do not.

"that we must advise GEneral Bennett time when shown"

Mr. Schwarz. Can you tell from the face of it, are we

| correct that this is a document that was sent from the CIA

station in Santiago to CIA headquarters purporting to come

and purporting to be directed to Lieutenant

| General Bennett?

Mr. Phillips. That is true.

Mr. Schwarz. In the ordinary course to whom would
such a cable go? And the second question, who would have the
responsibility of passing information on to General Bennett?

Mr. Phillips. In the ordinary course of events this cable
would have come to me where I was working in the sense of an
info copy and this, that and the other.

The action on this cable would have certainly have gone
at least to Mr.Broe, and possibly higher, because it says,
this is his message to the head of another government
service. And so it would have gone to that level.

Mr. Schwarz. And in the ordinary course it would have
come to you first, and then it would have been passed on to
either Mr. Broe or someone higher to take action?

Mr. Phillips. For action -- not always. Sometimes a
cable will come in and there will be more than one copy.

And right away the action copy will go to the other fellow, and
then you get the information copy, and so forth.

Mr. Schwarz. Can you tell from the face of this cable

whether there would have been more than one copy?

Mr. Phillips. There is no indicator to say who it went
to.
Mr. Schwarz. Does the"eyes only"have any significance
to you in the third line?

Mr. Phillips. Only in the sense that what

Ps § was saying was, this may go over to the Defense Depart-

ment, but not through regular channels, and not to anyone else
other than General Bennett.

Mr. Schwarz. Did it go to General Bennett?

Mr. Phillips. I do not know.

Mr. Schwarz. And did’ you pass it to someone?

Mr. Phillips. If it did not go it would have been
highly unusual for amessage to come in from overseas saying,
give this to the head of another Agency, and for it not to
be delivered it would have been extremely unusual.

Mr. Schwarz. What would te the normal form of its
delivery? Would there be a cover note put on it?

Mr. Phillips. It would have probably been folded
into an envelope and delivered by hand. Because if it is
really an “eyes only" message of such import, if it goes
through a communications channel, it means that they are going
to be operators of machinery to see it, and so forth... If
an American Ambassador overseas wants to get a very sensitive
message up he has the option of sending it to us and saying,

will you please hand carry this over to the Secretary of State?

Mr. Phillips. I would gather from this message that
it is simply an explanation from -- it says General Bennett

to give him some rationale behind it when he
was down there running away trying to foment the coup,
saying, why is the U.S. Government still helping this govern-
ment?

I am speculating. But this was another one of those
messages quote unquote which went in our channels.

Mr. Schwarz. Who gave you this message?

Mr. Phillips. I do not remember.

Mr. Schwarz. You have no recollection whatsoever?

Mr. Phillips. Sir, it is five years ago, and there are

I was the least interested in in the sense of being involved,

Mr. Fenn. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. Talking about telephones, incidentally,
was there a secure telephone between Washington and Santiago
which was used for messages, or did you use the cable always?

Mr. Phillips. We never used the telephone, unless it is
a personal message like your aunt died and you have to get on
the next plane for the funeral. Otherwise you use those
absolutely marvelous communications facilities that get it
down there --a flash cable will get there in 20 minutes.

In the recess I have been thinking about this, and I re-
alize that I have not been very helpful in what obviously is
a contradictory situation here. As I read it, either General
Bennett does not recall this, or else there was some sort of
endeavor within CIA headquarters to use his name. Is that
the approach we are making to this?

Mr. Schwarz. I don't think we are trying any approach.
He has denied any knowledge of this.

Senator Schweiker. We are just confused.

Mr. Phillips. Maybe I am confused, too.

Senator Schweiker. Can you enlighten us at all?

Mr. PHillips. If it were someone in CIA headquarters
saying, we are going to use Bennett's name without his

knowledge because it has a lot “of clout, I don't understand

why. Because the messages went from Philpott

that moment began cooperating with the Chief of Station. I don'
recall any instance where there was any indication of hesitancy
on his part about doing what he was doing.

And I certainly can't comment about General Bennett's
side, not having been involved with him.

From the CIA side I suppose it is ee that some-
one is using that business that I referred to in dispatches,
General Bennett says, when they are really talking about
what a subordinate of General Bennett says, and they figure
he is acting for them, or something like that. I guess that

is conceivable.

But I would find it very unusual to see some sort of
little plot hatched here, because there was no need to.

Mr. Schwarz. What you are saying is that you can't see
a motive?

Mr. Phillips. Precisely.

I can't see the motive for fooling

cause had already started working when he re-

ceived the instructions from the number two man in his Agency,
which is indeed pretty high up.

So, I am afraid the reasons that I am not being helpful
is that I, tod,’ am confused.

Mr. Schwarz. I just received a note indicating that
Mr. Bolten of the Agency has told us that both of the October

14 cables were authored by you. I don't know if that adds

Senator Schweiker. Let me ask counsel this.

Can we establish that Philpott did communicate --

Mr. Schwarz. Philpott is going to testify on Tuesday.
We have talked to him.He accepts at least one message. There
are two which purport to be signed by him, and he is not
sure if he accepted two.

Senator Schweiker. So, he has accepted one message?

Mr. Schwarz. He accepted one message, yes.

Mr. Phillips. You wanted to ask about a meeting.

Mr. Schwarz. It was a final meeting you had with Helms?

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

The death of General Schneider had occurred. And while,
as we said previously, things had fallen into place according
to "plan", an egregious plan, it was absolutely my conviction
that those orders that I had been predicting, which were very,
very slim, were now completely unacceptable, one reason being

that the inauguration was going to be in 48 hours -- not the

-inauguration, but the confirmation, and so forth.

And so as I recall, there was a meeting of quite a few

of us, probably myself and and Mr. Broe and Mr.

Karamessines, and maybe Mr. Flannery, -~ no, I guess not, but

I do remember thatmeeting going up there and saying, if there
ever was a chance, it is now finished, and somebody has got to
say that it is finished. And so that is what I meant by that

meeting.

Miss Culbreth. Thank ou

I would like to direct your attention to this cable
that you were questioned about. It is the one that is dated
September27, 1970. And Mr. Schwarz read from that ana in
talking with you earlier. This was the cable which said "A
false flag base of staff would be established in Santiago by
10 October".

And you were questioned about'this part: "These
officers will perform the delicate chores with great flap

potential which cannot be done by station personnel or any

Chilean. An example: We have a who can pose as

intelligence officer. If he approached, funded and

In the second paragraph which was not read earlier,
I would like to-read this and then put a question to you:

“Headquarters believes this false flag base, manned by
officers who have repeatedly proved their ability to operate
and recruit under false colors, will give station great
flexibility in handling delicate and fast-moving situations
securely".

To me this second paragraph indicates that these false
flag officers were people that had experience in this very

kind of intelligence operations, is that correct?

Mr. Phillips. Every one of them was known to me per-

Miss Culbreth. And had been in this kind of capacity
as a false flag officer?

Mr. Phillips. Yes.

Miss Culbreth. So,this was not some rere and unusual ||
devious approach or mechanism that was being employed in this
instance?

Mr. Phillips. The purpose of that explanation, es-
pecially the second paragraph that you read, was -~ the imme-
diate reaction, as I recall, from the station when they first
heard that we were given their assignment, was, come on,
that flap potential is great, it is not going to work, what

was terribly upset, because he is a sort of

an old pro, and he wanted to get into position, in other words,
to plan for the future, and all of a sudden this new thing
came in. The purpose of that cable was to explain to the
station that we had been given this job to do and that we

at headquarters saw that as the safest way for them to
accomplish the job that they had been given with the least
possibility of embarrassing the American Ambassador, and that
sort of thing.

though this says, probably by General Viaux and _so forth

Miss Culbreth. Was there any question in your mind
as principal operating officer here in the states that there
was a delineation or a demarcation of function between the
Viaux group and the Valenzuela group, or did you regard them
as one big group down there accomplishing this, or did you real]
regard them as separate groups?

Mr. Phillips. I very definitely regarded them as two
separate groups, always with the caveat that in Latin America
some one always has a cousin who talks to someone else.

But I very definitely regarded them as two separate groups,
and when General Viaux was called off earlier in October, I
thought that General Viaux was out of the thing, and I thought
that without support that he wasn't going to try anything.

And then we had the other group which seemed to be
more serious people, and with more capabilities. And I
very definitely regarded them as two separate groups.

Miss Culbreth. Let me ask just a few questions that
might sort of help us a little bit in our housekeeping opera-
tions when we get to the point of trying to tie everything up
on these.
