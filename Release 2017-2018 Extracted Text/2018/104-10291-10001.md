MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Services Career

Service Board (Panel A)

SUBJECT

: Joseph B. Smith - Recommendation for

Promotion from GS-14 to GS-15

1. Mr. Smith joined the Headquarters Training Branch of the

OTR Operations School in October 1966 specitically to assume respon

sibility for Covert Action training.

He spent the first few months in

a thorough study and review of all CA courses previously given in OTR

This was a long and complicated job, compounded in part by the public

compromise of a wide rarge of Agency CA activities. In closest coordi

nation with the CA Staff, Mr. Smith devised a totally new and different

CA curriculum, consisting of twe short seminars for middle and senior

gradé officers - one called a Covert Aclien Operations Seminar and

one a Politica Workshop. These seminars, emphasizing the integrated

nature of CS operations, have evoked a very positive response, con-

firming the soundness of Mir. Smith'a creatine elforts in revamping

CA training in this fashion.

2.

As a corollary to the main duties cited abore, Mr. Smith has

aiso successfully run, in conjunction with FS Division, & Psychological

Warfare Operations Course for military officers being assigned to

MACV/SOG in Saigon, Finally, in the CA ficla, dir. Smith has pro-

vided tutorials, as requested by various ares Divisions, to a number

of Stali and Contract Arente ind lo forcion liaison repricentarises, in

such fields aa

organizations,

and moshods of countering Comunist propaganda.

3o In February 1969 Mr. Smith was astru to asgune respon-

sibility as Tradecrait Advisor and Coordinator dor the Operitiono

Support Course, a critical block of instruction for (primarily joung

and inexperienced) CS clericals headed for overseas ausignmente

where they may be called upon to assiat case officers in operational

support tasks. Although; strictly speaking, this teaching and coordi-

nation task wäs outside Mr. Snith's normal purview and main area

of expertise, he accepted this additional responsibility with exemplary

willingness,

and then proceeded to discharge it smoothly, energetically.

and effectively. • In addition to managing an extensive live problem, the

Tradecraft Advisor must ensure that presentations by a number of

instructors result in a balanced and coherent coverage of all operational

subjecte in the course. This entailo the coordination of ciforte of

several senior and experienced instructors, all under the nominal aegis

of the course's Chief Instructor, and, thus, demands a great deal of

finesse and tact. Mr. Smith has not only fulfilled this difficult role in

a highly efficient manner but has also drawn on his own long field

experience for pertinent and meaningful contributions to the course.

During Mr. Smith's tour with OTR, he was requested to

participate as a member of a Survey Team in a review of the effective -

ness of the Propaganda Group of the CA Staff, In a 30 June 196T

memorandum of appreciation to the Director of Training, Chief, CA

Staff commented as follows on Mr. Smith's work:

"Throughout Mr. Smith participated in a most

effective professional manner bringing to bear

his extensive background in the Clandestine

Services.

His direct and objective approach

to the problems considered in the course of

the survey made his contribution to the over-

all Team effort invaluable.

The Team report,

which I am still in the process of discussing

within the Staff, will be of considerable value

not only to this Staff in our future planning but

also, I feel, to the future posture of the covert

propaganda mission of the Clandestine Services;

thus, I heartily commend Mr. Smith for hia.

effective participation with the Survey Team

in this effort."

5.. In his last two fitness reporte Mr. Smith has received a

"Strong"' rating and the Chief of the Operations School as reviewing

official has added his opinion that M.. Smith has done his job with

distinction and with credit to himsell and his career service, citing

the assignment to OTR-as a first-rate example of quality in rotational

tours.

While Mr. Smith passed on his expertise through the training

proceas, he also enhanced his own versatility through involvement

in the various training activities cited abovo.

6. In récognition of the foregoing, it is felt that Mr. Smith

is qualified to carry out the duties of the GS-15 grade for which he

is recommended. Mi. Smith has been in grade 5 1/2 years.

Chief, Operations School/OTR

Smith has worked under my supervision on to accisions,

once in

and most recently in the Oftice of Training.

Both jobs were in the CA field where Smith is, I believe, one of the

Agency'a most experienced officers. My own view is that Smith

made an outstanding contriburion to Agency training, particularly

in CA, during his recent tour with OTR.

Concerning his performance here

instruction in the CA field. As a result, Mr. Smith has not yet had the opportunity

to teach.

This will come shortly, however, when a now course beging on 8 May.

The "Strong" rating given him here is based on the excellent work and thoroughly

profeasional approach he has taken in all of the preparatory work he has under-

taken. He has been eminently successful in establishing usuful new relationships

and in maintaining his old contacts in the Clandestine Services for the purpose.of

laying a solid groundwork for high quality training. In addition to his responsi

bilities in OTR he has been regularly consulted by the CA Staff in a survey of

one of its activitics. This is finc testimony for the regard in which he is held

outside the confines of his preacht job. The prognosis for a very effective

performance in all of his teaching assignments is exccllent." He has no super-

visory sosponsibilities and is average in cost consciousness.

The rating of

"outstanding" on

While

he has continued. to maintain it at a high level, there

is

some question

in my mind whether a rating of "outstanding" is

still justified.
