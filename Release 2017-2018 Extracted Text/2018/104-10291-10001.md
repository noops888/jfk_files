MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Services Career

Service Board (Panel A)

SUBJECT : Joseph B, Smith - Recommendation for

. Promotion from. GS-14 to GS-15
\ 1, Mr, Smith joined the Headquarters Training Branch of the
OTR Operations School in October 1966 specifically to assume respon-
sibility for Covert Action training. He spent the first few months in
a thorough study.and review of all GA courses previously given in OTR.
This was a long and:complicated job, compounded ii-part by the public
compromise of a wide. rarige of Agency CA activities. In closest coordi-

_ Ration with the GA Staff, Mr, Smith devised a totally sew and different
_. GA curriculum, consisting of twu short seminars for middlé and senior’.
~ grade officers -- one called a Covert Acticn Operations Serninar and

a Workshop, These seminars, eriphasizing the integrated
nature of CS operations, have evoked a very positive response, con-
firming the soundness of Mr, Smith's cfeative efforts in revamping

CA training in this fashion.

2 Aga corollary to the main duties cited above, Mr, Smith has
aiso successfully run, in conjunction with Division, a Psychological
Warfare Operations Course for military officers being assigned to
MACV/SOG in Saigon, finaly, in the CA £ ir, Smith has pro-
vided tutorials, as requested by variou! As, toa number

and inexperienced) CS clericals headed for overseas assignments

* where they may be called upon to assist case officers in operational

support tasks, Although, strictly speaking, this teaching and coordi-
nation task was outside Mr, Srnith's normal purview and main area

of expertise, he accepted this additional responsibility with exemplary
willingness, and'then proceeded to discharge it smoothly, energetically,
and effectively, ~ In addition to managing an extensive live problem, the
Tradecraft Advisor must ensure that presentations by a number of
instructors result ina balanced and coherent coverage of all operational
subjects in the course. This entails the coordination of efforts of-
several senior and experienced instructors, ali under the nominal aegis
of the course's Chief Instructor, and, thus, demands a great deal of
finesse and tact, Mr, Smith has not only fulfilled’ this difficult role in

a highly efficient manner but has alse drawn on his own: long field
experience for pertinent and: meaningful contributions to the course.

4, During Mr. Smith's tour with OTR, he was requested to
participate as a member of’a Survey Team in a- review of the ¢ffective-
ness of the Propaganda Group of the CA Staff, Ina 30 June 1967
memorandum of appreciation to the Director of Training, Chief, CA
Staff commented as.follows on Mr, Smith's work:

at "Throughout Mr. Smith participated in a most

effective professional manner bringing to bear
his extensive background in the Clandestine
Services, His direct and objective approach
to the problerns considered in the course of
the survey made his contribution to the over-
all Team clfort.invaluable, The Team report,
which 1am still in the process of discussing
within the Staff, will be of considerable value
not only to this Staff in our future planning but
also, I feel, to-thé furure posture of the covert
propaganda mission of the Clandestine Services;
thus, J heartily commend Mr, Smith for his
effective participation with the Survey Team”
in this effort,"

Se. In his last two'fitness reports Mr. Smith has received a
"Strong" rating and the Cnief of the: Operations School as reviewing
official has added his opinion that Mr, Smith has done his job with
distinction and with credit to himself and hia career service, citing
the assignment to-OTR-as.a first-rate example of quality in rotational
tours. While Mr. Smith passed on his expertise through the training
process, he also enhanced his own versatility through involvement
in the various training activities cited above.

_ 66 In recognition of the foregoing, it is felt that Mr, Smith
ia qualified to carry out the duties of the GS-15 grade for which Ke
is recommended, Mr, Smith haa been in grade 5 1/2 yeara,

School, Mr. Smith has been principally engaged ‘nator gyah study and review

of all courses in Covert Action previdusly given in OTR." This has been a tong

and complicated job, the difficulty of which has been.compounded by the necessity,
at least in part through public events, to plah and project a total revision of
instruction in the CA field. As a result, Mr. Smith has not yet had the opportunity
to teach. “This will come shortly, however, when a new course begins-on 8 May,
The "Strong" rating given him here is based on the excellent work and thoroughly
professional approach he has taken in all of the preparatory work he has under«
‘takers He has been erinently successful in.establishing useful new relationships
and in maintaining hig old contacts in the Clandestine Services for the purpose of.
laying’'a éolid. groundwork for high quality training. In addition to his responsi=
bilities in OTR he has been regularly consulted by, the CA Staff in a survey of

‘one of its activities, Thia ie fine testimony for the regard in which he is held~--
outside the confines of his prescnt job, The prognosis for a very effective -
performance in all of his teaching asdignments is excelent. He has no supers.

SUBJEC
Mr. Joseph Smith’

1. Botween 16 January and 26 May 1952 your consultant held a
group of eixteen Secret conferences on specialized techniques in.
with particular. reference to the Far
Eastern ‘arod. Theve confererices amounted to a'séries of reorientation
and developmontal. meetings in which porsons actually on the Job at CIA
in OFC capacities. could review their own doctrine, talents, and
opportunities for serving the Governnent and the Agency in this field.

2. The topics covered includad? a survey of the goals sought
through covert activities of tho U,S,.dovermient; the basic bitliog=
raphy on covert operations; the ‘action response of targot groups}
media vehicles and tho cultural terrains: specific covert paychological
warfaré ‘techniques; the intelligence neéd for CPW; the operational
vocabulary of Marxiom; psychiatry and-CPH; proparanda analysis; ccntent
analydiaj pross techniques of the Chinese Commniste; covert, economic
warfare and CPWj.personality problems in covort operations; baste
doct#ino on passive registanco; and a toview meoting.

3. In difficulty and in seriousness of approach, this seriés of
conferences correzpunded to an ‘advanced praduate course in an American
university. It was-a mixture of the seriinar and lecture techniques.

k. Mre Joseph Smith immediately made himself one of tha outstanding
participants of the group. He brought. tho capacity of a reflective
and richly educated mind to this new field and demonstrated a real
talont for sooing the opportiinities presented by novel. and’ uncenventional
methods of attack upon Communism. Not only did Hr. Smith learn a
great dual himself; he contributed substantially’ to tho Intellectual
participation of the other members of the conferences in the common
