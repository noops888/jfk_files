relating to what in effect is the re-establishment of the board

For the purnose of endorsing estimates but from the standpoint

that they are there for the rurnose of reviewing them.

Now what it does, the firet paragraph summarizes the

Executive order.

Now it is slightly different from the Executive Order

in the following sense. The Penautive Order establishes an

NSC Committee, gives the Comalttee the resconsibllity of

he is responsiblefor menaring the community'e hudget,

and he has this committer for this purpose in trying to place

responsibilitv squarely on him in do that.

Now this would not mean, however, that the Secretary of

Defense he senior to him in the rabinet. I mean the National

Security Council could not make a, reclama and could not go over

That situation vill till exist and this conmitree is

I think it's fair to sav that

he ares netty far in gettim his way at the present time, but

on some of these requirerent on a national basis, this would

aive him the clear authority in ask them to do things.

Now his renulranants: the level of detail and so forth,

wnuld obviously be somethiny that would have to be negotiated

out in the course of his wanl..

Now that is the recommondation of the first par-graph

Now the next margan!.? -

Mr. Kirbow. Could "e taka these one at a time hecause

these are rather critical?

Mr. Chairman, one of the things that came before this

Committee when I quess it was it. Colhy testifying and at each

menting that Mr. Miller ard the staff had with the people from

the white House and the cin when we

were preparing the oversight

Pet of this ability to

that we should restrict by lericlation here -

Senator Huddleston. What is the major thrust there?

Mr. Aaron. No, we can't do that. But in his new

responsibilities as DCI for vreparing the budget of the entire

For instance, with the comilton on Armed Services.

Senator Huddleston. For other departments?

ME. KiFisOW..

Where there is an authorizing and an

appropriations type action in the Congress, as Senator Hart

will know from his expericnee on that committee, if they wish

to reprogram missile money mar to aircraft, for instence, it

has to be anproved by all fur of those committers, both

Arms Servions and hoth antonciations committees with the

exact transfer of the amounts of moner and the justifications

al.ven therefore.

My concern is not that the contrass should not have

control of this or that you could make it so rigid by making

recommendations that leare

just recommending here that

in this statute they provide the

Mr. Kirbow. If that's the intent of the committee, I

have no reservations about it.

Senator Huddleston: Tdon't think th military people

is that the office of estimates uns created under the Eisenhowed

Mr. Kirhow. I want to talk about the testimony that

was given before the committae on this from two of the former

nCIs. Mr. Colsy, at both the broakfast briefings he gave and

in testimonv. favored the use of individual intelligence offices

around in these various arancies, originating estimates and

everything else: whereas Me.. Helms,. when he testified here,

savs I really don't know ho: that system is corking richt now.

I didn't tavor it when Mr. Colby established it, and i had the

other sustem and it worked well. for mo.

So I think here anain you are talking about a man

staffing rennirements as thar suit the narticular times and

the individual as to how he wants to run the intelligence

community and what apparently suited Mr. Helms fine didn't

suit Mr. Colhy and he used

= different system which he says

works great. And I say that that is, again, a step down thing.

Unless vou want to encourage him to do it in a recommendation

and not mandate that he do it, it kind of makes him run his

husiness the way you want it run and to no apparent abuse

problems.or anything like that.

This all de

Mr. Kirbow. I sinnly indicated to the Chairman earlier

that I didn't want to have a reservation like that and not

point it out to him because I didn't want the absent momber

to appear to be sandbarine the subcommitte.

Senator Huddleston. Ha's putting us on notice.

Mr. Aaron. Ootion 17, this option steps up to the

nostion of whether the ber in his new canacity an the overall

manager df the communitr: at by manager l don't mean down in

of interneting the budget in torms of roguirements,

from that

Now we have heard sone tastimony about the inconsistency

between those two responsihilities..

I think the arguments, if

I can set them on the too aldes, could be as follows. And

by the wav, there's a diffrance of chinton in the start as

to which of these is the right one to foller.

The arrument

are inconstatant. that me could have, on remore the pCI

of treat interest to the camuntty, and vou take him nut of the

position of having to juare sther people'g research and

development, proarams and other people's SIGINi programs, and

other activities when he is the merall director of Central

Intelligence, and that therafors this separation, his removal

finm that, would be

a good idea.

The second argument is that you really want to mlace the

authoritu squarely on the mur director of this agency who's

moino to la responsible for clandestine activities. If he

still has a hoss above hin who is kind of responsible but who

in fact because of his increased responsibilities won't bel

able to rivo the day to day attention to clandestine activities

that he might, if he didn't havo these dreater responcihilities

one should make the lines of authority clear and place the

responsibility for the head of this agene: on that agency

and leave it there.

Now the armument arainst that is that ... well, there are

two kinds of arguments roninst. one is that the situation now

is justified and that this is a mood thim and we don' need

to make any change and there are good reasons to beliare that.

Now my

question in this. Assuming that we were to achieve

a1l of the measures in the recommendations that we have here

For the DCI budget and all the rost, it seems to me that that

is an awful lot of work without havina to be concerned with the

day to day operations of the cia.

I don't know. I fret raise the question.

Senator Huddleston. I think that's a rood point.

Mr. Lombard. He Firit of all has to resent the budget

to the President. He has to defond the budget un on the hill.

and that's in at least four committees. And then he's got to

have an analvtical base, and presumahly the national estimate

function and on too of that, vorrving about the day to day

onetations of the Adency.

I don't know if that is more than one may should be

asked to do.

- Senator luddleston. Mell, when we talk about major

reorganization and re-assionment of functions, almost, and

we're probably confusina that by continuing to call the man

who 1s aoint to supervice al! of the intolligence

Mr. Bader.

it is not really relevant on the muestion of what the Der will

The argument I would mole here is that the oversight

We did not take that testimony any further than receiving his

testimony. That is, we have not taken it to che point of:

asking the agency whether in fact they have such a program

in the Southwest. So the testimony was limited to that one

charge which I personally rave some

real credibility

to.

Ms. Culbreth. Can you explain just what the charge is

here? What is the wrond that ha: been done?

Mr, Kirbow. What's wrong with that? That's the question!

I had in the original suggestion at the staff level.

The only human collecticy we are getting from behimd

the Iron Curtain in Russia today is principally either though

our cooperation with the

comnunity using

just this sort of individual and sending them back, or sending

this type of individual from this United States back inside.

we're not getting the other human intelligence.

Mr. Bader. I was only responding to the question of

what the testimony was.

To go on to the further issue which I think is going

to be addressed by the connittee, it's not the question of

whether e should, the Contral Intelligence Agency should be

recruiting foreigners

the Committee would want in take a position about recruitment

Mr. diGenova. My position is this, Bill. The first

time I heard about this was when I read it in these findings

and corclusions. I never saw a hearing on it, I never saw a

document about it, I never had a chance to comment on it as

a desianee, and I never had a chance to bring it up with my

Senator.

I''ll not sure that me want to say this, ask

the Senators

to say this, without having.

something in a report about

the practice is, how jt's been conducted, who has objected to

it. what's the extent of it, before we start makiug a

recommendation.

We're saving we question the practice of recruiting.

I have no objection to the Committee ultimately making

statement like this,

I lust don't know what the record is.

This is the first time l've ever seen this.

Mr. Bader. That's why I wanted it bracketad so it could

be so discussed.

have.

Mr. Aaron.

My recommendation is that we get the Agency

on record as to whether this is the practice or not.!

Mr. Kirhon: I recommand it be dropped from this if

we had only one witness and

reive not heard the Agency or

that we develop a record to support both that and the same

part of that first paragraph; which I con't think we have a

record on either.

Mr, saron. We do have a record on that. It's an

First sentence, there is an interview to support that.

" Mr. Kirhow.. Mr. Chairman. I think the subcommittee then

should carefully consider whether or not it is concerned about

inteliiaenon and if so. how this innacts on anybody s rights

When we talk about expresaly prohibiting penetration of

American companies, it seems to me that the question is whether

or not we're penetrating those companies with company executives

being unwitting or whether

Sevator Huddleston.

It seems to me the real problem is

when we were doing it secretly.

Mr. Aaron. And that's the point.

Senator Huddleston,

The company ought to have the

right to make a

determination as to whether or not its interest

would be severely jeopardized if this were to happen.

Mr.. Treverton..

I think this

language probably isn't

clear enough. If we did human

penetration without the

Mr. Kirbow. Ne're talking about

Mr. diGenova. May teel in this regard, it ends up.

by saying, although accordint to CIA officials such activity

has not taken place - what's the other evicence that it has

which created the sentenco?

MI. Aaron. In looking at what the foreign rescurces

division does in the way of penetration of businesses as

opposed to collecting agents on campuses or in some other

walk of life, we found that the IRD actually runs agents in

only a for cases.

The cases are Amarteans amployed by local industries in

the United States or consulates.

In other words, in airlomat consulate establishments

in which there are few

In which indeed the Americans

vorking for those diplomatie establishments are agents of the

are not officers of the CIA but they were agents of the CIA

in. that resnect.

Mr. Kirhow. They work in the embassies

as you say?

Mr. Aaron. Yes, lare in the United States, and this

is talking about domestte impact. This is not the foreign

situation.

There has been at laagt one case and I belive there are

two but only one I can specify: in which the FRD had a

American agent in ? foradan cannony, a foroion bared upany.

It was very unambiguous that tha company vas a forela, company

hecause in effect it was a nublle comnany of a

countr whose

most business enterprises are oned by the government. But

it's a company and it's hisiness and it was a foreign company

and the question was, and it related to

Mr. Kirhow. And this agent was apparently here in the

The next question

that was put to, I believe, the chief

of the FRD was do you have any regulations that prohibited

You from

doing the same thing with an American company? And

the answer was no, we don't, although we don't do that or

we haven't done that or

something to that effect.

That is essentially the story and how it came to pass.

Mr. Maxwell. There's some question on both of these

whether there are ways of saying things that are important

as

recommendationg ithout imol.ving that A, these had gone on

and B, that we have a record to support that.

There's also. I guess, a slight question in my mina

as to the order of maanttute. of the recommendations that flow

from this in the promulantion of a specific directive.

That's slightly out of synch with the order of some of

the other reconmerdations. The Committee might want to choose

to dece that to a

contractors building planes in order to find out they had...

security risks, a laborer of an executive inside.

Mr. Maxwell. It was witting to a certain extent.

Mr. Bader. I think one of the problems we have here is

this question of whether in our formal recommendations that we

should enjoin the agency fron doing things that they don't do.

And where, there's no evidence they have any intention -

Mr. Kirbow. The '47 dot prohibits this kind of conduct

within the United States.

Mr. Bader. And T. thinl: that that should be catefully

considered. Ne have no evidence that the Central Intelligence

Agency penetrates Congressional staff, but we have not put it

in as a recommendation that they should not penetrate

Congressional staffs.

I think the other matter that has been raised about the

onerational exploitation of recruiting individuals who are in

an immigrant status and socking a change a change in etatus,

In other words, it's trying to establish a standard.

Can we just commend them for that? Can

Mr. Aaron. Well, the Committee notes that it's been

the practice not to do this and that that should continue as

a part of their standard proceduras.

Senator Huddleston. Senator Mathias had the suggestion

", as coas

Mr. Bader. I've asked them to be prepared to speak to

Mr, Bader. If we have this room, as I hone we do, we

would take the testimony right here and if need be, move it

to another room.

Senator Mathias. In the event that I should not be

able to he here, and I hone I will, I think we ought to look

at this

thing pretty closely.

Senator Huddleston said earlier, you don't recruit

neople in where they really are perhans totally allenated from

In the meantime, of course, we can still be working on

Mr.. diGenova. Yentarday: Me. Bolton indicated to me

when I was there that there was no way that they could complete

sources and methods review by the 15th of March, and I said

I didn't see how they could either, since they had just really

begun having access a week or so ago or whatever it was.

And they seem to think that the end of the month is probably,

considering the rewrites and a chance to look at the rewrites--

Senator Mathias. I have been independently advised of

the same thing, that the end of the month is marhe a little

ootimistic:

Mr. Miller.

Senator Church just talked to Directo

Bush

and I talked to Mitch Rogovin Just prior and worked out an

arrangement on the question of clearances of sensitive material

and the Chairman told Mr. Bush that he will take whatever time

is required, he asked for expeditious effort on their part.

MI. Bush said that he would urge his troops onward, and he

recognized that there had been snags and difficulties. The

Chairman said that he was not going to press beyond the

capability of either side. He wants to do the proper job

and whatever time is required.

He said that he hoped that we could cooperate and work

It out so that we could fintch by the and of the month.. And

Mr. Bush said that he would make every effort to do that.

So that seers amicahir between the Chairman an! the

Director.

This is probably the most difficult task that faces

and is available to the CiA and it

would be their job to compile it.

And that does not

exclude other functions.

For example,

the analytical function is not mentioned here. This is simply

to rive it the collection function and that is because the

paper is simply organized in that fashion. It doesn't try to

step up to the whole charter, every aspect of it. We just try

to hreat. it down.

Mr.. Maxwell. Should there be a kind of nvert foreign

Intelligence which the NSC with the mechanism for allocating

priorities

within the intelligence community

should

done by the CIA?

It could under the formulation now do that.

Mr. Aaron.

That's why for examole there's one thing that

they do that's overt. Even their clandestine people abroad

do an overt collection job

and that is biographic information

and that, while it was once in the State Department, was

transferred

to the CIA hecauce they have a lot of clandestine

bioaraphic information and as a matter of centralizing and

efficiency the decision was made to move it over there.

That kind of thing would not be precluded and wuld still

exist.

Now it goes on to state that in doing this ve would also

recommend authorizing the eid to carry out the recruttment of

agents within the United states for this purpose.

Further to say that there would he an annual review of this

activity by the senate p'ersight committee and by the

counter-intelligence committee which we proposed be established

and has been agreed here as a recommendation of the

National

Security Council.

Now the further sentence that is in brackets calls upon

the Attorney General to

certify

to the President and to

the oversight committee that these actions are being taken in

a manner that does not violate the Constitutional rights of

American citizens or any other provision of law.

Truing to keep track of the domestic intelligence

recommendations is a little hit like painting a moving train,

but this tends to coincide with their recommendation, and the

purpose of this is obviously to place a Ilttle tighter

restriction and more authority in the hands of the Attorney

General to ensure that these domestic espionage-related actions

that are conducted on

a covert or clandestine basis are in

fact not infringing on Constitutional rights or attempting to

break the law in any way.

Mr. Kirbow. And the bracketed Information, Mr. Chairman,

was that I didn't feel at the time we considered this and I

asked that it be bracketed, that the Attorney General who is

never going to operate in this area alone, he is not going

to make these decisions without staff support of some description,

and if he's going to do that with people in the Department of

Tistice, which is where he gets the staff, the concern of the

people in the Agency about broadening even within their own

agency those people that know about the agent orocurements and

where they are and whom they are is of vital concern. It's

probably one of the most carefully guarded secrets. Even

extent that Mr. Colby testified befor

hecause someone may want to decide

does

for you if on the sane subcommittee you have the DCI,

who is the President's principal man, you have the secretaries

of state and all these other people apparently at the beck and

call in intelligence matters to put the Attorney General and

his staff Into the agent procurement business.

and he can't do that if he doesn't know when one of the agencies

It's a chicken and

Mr. Kirbow. You think he should approve the policies

the actual procurement of the agent.

Senator Hart. The procedures. Nothing in here. I mean

that renuires the Agency to burn over names of their sources

It seems to me that one of the concerns that you have

with having the Attorney General certify in this specific

case to the

President and also to the oversight committee

1g a consistent

problem that I think runs throughout our

recommendations.

On the one hand, we are describing for accountabtlity

within the Executive Branch of the proper people, and on the

other hand ve

are afraid that if we make him accountable, we're

alving him so much pover that they are toing to dierenard tha

In this specific ribuntion, for example, we've already

not the

Attorney General. heing involved with the oversight

responsibilities. When he takes office he already has the

obligation to see that all the laws and activities of agencies

are carried out as they're subposed to be.

And in addition to that, we

are proposing in another

nart of our recommendations that the general counsel and the

inspector general of the CIA he subject to.

Senate confirmation

so that there are lots of other kinds of checks, and I would

just hope that as the senators consider additional proposals

Ike this. that we don't get to the point that the Congres

is hamstringing them ingide the agencies on how they carrya

ont the responsihilities:

Each one of these standing by itself may look like,

well, this is a good idea and we should have this additional

certification or this addition chain of reporting and making

sure vou get it authorized.

But I have a fear after having looked through a Hood

bit of this, that we aro getting too many layers in there, and

I would just urge a caution if there are situations where we

mavhe have it pretty well covered until ue tet some opportunity

to see how thir new set-un is going to work, whether we're

Mr. MiGenova. Mr. Chairman, I would add in that regard

that with regard to the smactic recommendation, this 18

not going down into the Ayency. This is talking about the

Attorney Ceneral who is the head of an agency, first of all,

and the history has shown that other Attorneys General who

took the same oath that this man did didn't do their jobs and

one of the reasons was that they didn't know ahout certain

thiners.

And the nurnose of this provision is to make them aware

of what is soing on, to make legal. judgements and to advise

about the legality of procedures attending

The nrovision for confirming the inspector general and

of law?

I have worked in a state law department and had to

sian some certifications

much simpler than this, and I agonized

of the Attorney General for him to make any kind of cartification,

I think we should get him involved but I question whether it

Mr. Aaron. I thin! that's a fair point. The question,

I quess, the case at which the certification would run most would

add to what already, is in the sentence preceeding it which

is review. by the Committee which the Attorney General is

to chair, would be the casc in which the Attorney General is

aware of a particular activity, is aware that it is illegal

but tust doesn't do anything about it on the theory that it

is sonebody else's business. And he doesn't really, he doesn't

have an obligation in this category of matters to render

a indement and bring it to the attention of the President

the congress.

Senator Mathias. Why don't we say this, that the

Attorney General be required to advise the President and the

oversight committee that he is familiar with the procedures

established to accomplish this purpose and that he is not

aware of any violation of the constitution or other law in

the execution of the action.

I think you can lay that kind of a burden on the Attorney

Genéral.

Mr., Aaron. Would it he cossible to just make it sort:

of a reportino function in which he said; and this is in the

same Airection, the Attorney General will he required to

advise the president and the ovorsight committee if he finds

that thee options are heim taker in a manner that vinlates?

Senator Huddleston. If in his opinion.

Senator Mathias: I wouldn't have any trouble with that.

Mr. Maxwell. I have one other point on that paragraph

and that is it provides for annual review by the counter-

intelligence committee of the National Security Council.

I had understood we were dealing with the recruitment

or agents for the United States foreign intelligence purposes,

and the question is whether the counter intelligence committee

which was

to focus on resoliing issues involving the bona

Eldes of defectors, issues hetween the FBI and CIA would be

the body which would have the appropriate knowledre in the

positive intelligence value, or whether it should be assigned

to a counter-intelligence function.

It's simply a question of where the responsihility

should be allocated for revieving those within the National

Security Council

structure, and I wasn't clear whether the

counter-intellidence committee was the appropriate one.

Mr. Aaron. Well, on that point.. the purpose of setting

un the countar-intelligence committee is essentilly to look

at the domestic innact of our intelligonce activities, the

notary ones being in the

The CIA sort of dues this in part as a service of

cummon concern to the in'elli ence community and in part at

least heretofore it does the niort collection function as a

service to its own analvstr.

This was particularly in the early days when we had

It it is from the sch. it has all the problems that

The

muestion the Committee har In face is where they are going to

It's located in Dod. from the now, whether it's located! in the
