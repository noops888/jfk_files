We also discusse? heiofly the recommendation number 16
and we aqreed that we would make some change in the language
relating to what in effect is the re-establishment of the board
of. national estimates to male clear that they weren't there just
for the purnose of endorsing estimates but from the standpoint

Now what it does, the first paragrarh summarizes the
essential resnonsibilities alond the. lines of the President's

Now it is slightlv different from the Executive Order

Now this would not mean, however, that the Secratary of

Mr. Inderfurth. 7 think that's in relation to helping

past, the board of. national estimates insrlated the DCI
from pressures.

Senator Iart. Chile, Ancola, all these cases where the
nCI comes in and says we don't really want to do that but the
President made us, does. he bring in the senior advisor to the
president and say, Llevely.: Vhompson doesn'*+ want us to, either.

Mr, Lombard. IT think park of the nroblem here. senator, |

in which foreian policy was evolved Turina that administmation |
Parbans as #® Matter of fach ik's been criticized as being overly
formalistic and the board of estimates was viewed as being

Mr. Kirbow. Iowank to talk about the testimony that
was given before the committee on this from two of the former

evervthing else: whereas Nr. lfelms,. when he testified here,

suit Mr. Colby and he used a different system which he says

Mr. Aaron. Collactina intelligence on the activities of

The next question that’ was put to, I believe, the chief

of the FRD was do you have any regulations that prohibited
you from doing.the same thing with an American company? And
the answer was no, we don't, although we don't do that or
we haven't done that or something to that effect.

That is essentially the story and how it came to pass.

Mr. Maxwell. There's some question on both of these

REY 19

Then the question arose abcut the deadline on the 15th
and the-Chairman is going to ask that this deadline be set
aside because of the problems of not being able to finish:
security and those other matters.

So he is taking steps to do that now.

Senator Huddleston. Put I think it's still encumbent
on us to make a special effort to move as fast as al ssa nd
we plan to to ahead toniqht. i

Okay, now we get back,

Mr. Aaron. We're on page 37 and the procedure we're

trying to follow to expedite things ia to look particular
at the recommendations and at the bracketed ianguage. ;

Senator Huddleston. Refore we cet to 20, there's a
prohlem in wording. “the last paragranh before 20, the
Committee also found that. there's no established inter-Agency

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, on that narticular thing, at
2 the staff level I had bracketed that entire paragraph hecause

4 there.

5 | This is probably the most difficult task that faces.

7. is to establish whether or not a defector. that you have just
8 | picked up is a double agent or -not. ;
9 I listened to the man who has done this all his adult

life at the Agency, Mr: Angleton, and he never made it clear

14 || just how you ever are sure that vou have a bona fide.

jal And then his follow-on said basically the same things j

CIA as to the hona fides a a defector and there's no way for
the government to come tc a decision about it.

And this really makes that point and leads to the a!
voint that we believe there ought to be some mechanism whereby
some decision can be reached. Now people may still have
reservations, as. they do about this particular individual we
refer to here. But in the end one has to make a decision and
simolv keeving him in a jail some place is vrohably net a
useful wav, to proceed, and in fact, this is the kind of
recommendation that comes from Mr. Angleton and seéms to be

supvorted by other neople. even his successor at the Agencd,.
A

Mr. Kirbow. Do we have any place in our findings Cite
discusses the so-called. this single case of some sort here?
Is there some evidence?

Mr. Aaron. Yes.

Mr. Kirbow. It's going to be in the report when somebody
else reads this? whey '14 be able to go some place else and
sage what von're talking ahout?

Mr. Aaron, That's correct. It will be in, I helieve it's
in the paper on counter-intelliaeance, It's. also addressed
in the Pockefeller Commission xrenert. :

Now as the first recommendation. I think that we have
anread at the staff level to hake out. the bracke!s and cut a

footnote which would make tb clear that while the nrimary

mission of che CIA would ha to collect dented or mrotected foreign

, intelliaaence information. that this would not, vou know. that

BN BR :

at the same time the Agency could be directed to perform such
other collection tasks as cdlirected by the NSC.

In other words, the point is that certainly they do

gnome overt collection. for example, foreign broadcast information

service is done by them as a service and so forth. But at. the»

same time the point of aiving the CIA a-charter' is to give ie:

on and as set forth NSCID 5,

a.charter for its primary mis
for exammle. that mission is to conduct esnionaqde.

Senator Mathias. What ahout the role of statistical
analysis? what kind of analysis that can be deduced ftom %
study of voluminous quantity of sconouic information much
of which is public?

I'll qo back to the hall bearings. the ball bearing
factory.

Mr. Aaron. Well, this gees to the point really of...

a organization of this section. There's a separate section

on the production of intellisence which would authorize the
CIA to produce national intsllicence. That kind of thing. The

Central Intelligence Agency as the producer of national

intelligence must he the vecinient of all intelligence flowing

into our overall national intelligence effort, and that -|-

intellicence ineludes crevt intelligence as collected from

the Treasury Nenartmant. from Commerce from Labor athaches

And that does not exclude other functions. For example,

2 analytical function is not mentioned here. This is simply
f | to qive it the collection function and that is because the

6 |} paper is simply organized in that fashion. It doesn't try to:

“2

step up to the whole charter, every aspect of it. We just try

to break it down.

Q Mr., Maxwell. Should there be a kind of overt foreign
19 || intelligence which the NSC with the mechanism for allocating
li priorities within the intelligence community should

ig jj done by the CIA?

12 It could under the formulation now do that.

ia | Mr. Aaron. That's why for examole there's one thing that
they do that's overt. Even their clandestine people abroad

16 || do an overt collection job and that is biographic information

y7 | and that, while it was once in the State Department, was

1g || transferred to the CIA because they have a lot of clandestine

biographic information and as a matter of centralizing and Hl

;, Further to say that there sould be an annual review of this

activity by the Senate oversight committee and by the
counter-intelligence committee which we proposed be established
and has been. agreed here as a recommendation of the National
Sacurity Council.

Now the further sentence that is in brackets calls upon
the Attorney General to certify to the President and to:
the oversight committee that these actions are being tsken in
a manner that does not violate the Constitutional rights of
American citizens or anv other provision of law.

tTrving to keep track of the domestic intelligence ;
recommendations is a little bit Like painting a moving tran,
but this re to coincide with their recommendation, and the
nurvose of this is obviously to place a little tiyhter

restriction and more authority in the hands of the Attorney

General to ensure that these domestic espionage-related actions; |

that are conducted on a covert or clandestine basis aré in
fact not infringing on Constitutional rights or attempting to

break the law in any way.

Mr. Kirbow. You're really talking about recruitments
néw. You're not talking shout other clandestine and covert

activities and operations?
Mr, Aaron. That's correct. It's not, for exemple, if

Mr. Kirbow. And tha bracketed information, Mr. Chairman,
was that I didn't feel at the time we considered this and I
asked that it be bracketed, that the Attorney General who is “
never going to operate in this area alone, he is not going
to make these decisions without staff support of some descriptid
and if he's going to do that with people in the Department of
wJuistice, which.is where he gets the staff, the concern of. the
people in the Agency about broadening even within their own
agency these people that know about the agent orocurements and
where they are and whom they are is of vital concern. It's
probably one of the most carefully guarded secrets. Even the
axtent that Mr. Colby testified befor? this Committee anda
oath. he said, I don't want to know the names of the agents

because someone may want to decide some day to wrassie it

out of me. I
I don't know what the Attorney General. certifying here :

who is the President's principal man, you have the secretaries

Senator Huddleston. If in his ovinion.

Senator Mathias: I wouldn't have any trouble with that.

Mr. Maxwell. I have one other point on that paragraph
and that is it provides for annual review by the counter-
intelligence committee of the National Security Council.

I had understood we were dealing with the recruitment -

| of aqents for the United Statas foreian intelligence purposes,

and the question is whether the counter intelligence committee
which was toa focus on resoliving issues involving the bona
tides of defectors, issues hetveen the FBI and CIA, would be

the body which would have the appropriate knowledae in the
positive intelligence value, or whether it should be assigned
+o a counter-intelligence function.

It's simply a question of where the responsibility

| should -be allocated for revieving those within the National

Security Council structure, and I wasn't clear whether the

counter-intelligence committee was the appropriate one.
Mr.-Aaron, Well, on that point,.the purpose of setting

Mr. Aaron. I think rhis is the auestion. Tt aces to

the point not of assistance to the government in general or
even covertly, but assistance to these narticular forces, and
that: I. think does narrov it down to the nroblem:

Sanator Huddleston. what kind ef support do we give. the

security forces?
Mr. Kirhow. Training.
Mr. Aaron. We have In the past. ve evn give them

tochnical,trainina. electronica. devices.

Mr. Kirhow. A whole spectrum exeert for U.S. nilitary
sunnort.

Mr. diGenava.. Some of the nreoricteries were used
for exactly thak purpose. to nrovide training and secure
nrocurement and sale and ican of devices hich ultimately
found their way into the hands of foreian torturers.

We certainly don't denrive the Agency of any legitimate
source of intelligence becanse they themselves claim that they
have never andaded.in this activity knowingty and don't want
to.

They say they den’ kt vant anvthing to do with this type
of actiVitv and thev cav they don't want te be involved with
internal. nolice forces thet conduct this tvne of activity.

They have said recently that thev have discontinued
