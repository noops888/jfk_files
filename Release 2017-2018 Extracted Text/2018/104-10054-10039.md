COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Although this employee is

a fine intelligence officer end. has worked.

very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City, I consider the rating

of Outstanding in all specific duties and for over-all performence to be

excessively high. Reporting on the activities she supervises has been

as good as that from other Mexico City operations but is still not up

to DDP standards.

While most of the projects she is concerned with are

bandled with proper cost consciousness, at least one of them, the LITEMPO

Project, is not.

The agents are paid too much and their activities are

not adequately reported. This has been called to the station's ettention.
