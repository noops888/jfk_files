USAOSD. has three contacts with Alpha 66:

a. Jordan James Pfuntner in contact with USAOSD team in Miani.

Pfuntner is a US citizen who is a plastics consultant. He apparently has

direct contact with the highest echelons of the Alpha 66 organization.

b. DUP 737 in contact with USAOSD team in Puerto, Rico. A US

insurance man located in San Juan, Puerto Rico who has contact with DUP 739

and possibly menbers of the

Alpha 66 group.

c. DUP 739 in contact with USAOSD team in Puerto Rico. A. Cuban

exile who works in the same insurance company a DUp 737, and, who is in

contact with members of the Alpha 66 group.

2.43) uf the above contacts, only Pfuntner is considered to have an

important entree to Alpha 66.

a. DUP 737 and 739 are used primarily as Spotter-Recruiters, and have

volunteered information concerning the activities of Alpha 66. A recent

example was prior notification of the raid on 8 October against La Isabela.

USAOSD team is afforded no access to members of the Alpha 66 group, does not

furnish requirements, nor dees it. finance either these Sources or the Alpha

66 group.

b. Initial contact was established with Pfuntner by the USAOSD. team

in Miani on 4, Ty, and I September 1962. During these contacts, Pfuntner

made the following statements:

(1) That he was incontact with a group which was going to conduct

raids against Cuba. This group was subsequently identified as Alpha 66.

That the group refuded to work with CIA, but desired to work

with the US military.

(3) That the group desired support of the US Army in their .

action phase, i.e., funds, equipment, ams, etc. In return the group would

provide information, would furnish captured equipment, and could land Agents

in Cuba.

b(iii)

(4) Pfuntner refused to identify any member of the group, or

to reveal any of their plans or modus operandi.

3.

To assess Pfuntner and his claims, and in the hope of obtaining

information, USAOSD requested that Pfuntner furnish items of Soviet Ordnance

d' information concerning Cuba. Communication with Pfuntner on

42 October indicated that Soviet equipment and information would be made

available to USAOSD in the near future as a result of the raid by Alpha

66 on La Isabela de Sagua on 8 October. It was further indicated that

important information concerning Soviet UDT countermeasures was also

obtained on this raid.

USACSD believes that lipha d√≥ has an excellent potential

to obtain military information from Cuba and also items of Soviet Ordnance

material. Exploitation of Alpha bo by USAOSD indicates that the following

factors should be (considered carefully:

a. If USAOSD attempted to coordinate the operational use of this

organization with CIA, it is believed that CIA would request that the

operation be turned over to them for exploitation.

b. Alpha 66 appears more properly an action type organization

engaged in combatting Communism by armed force than a clandestine organization,

and might be better utilizad by General Lansdale's shop.

co It is considered

possible that the activities of Alpha 66 might

have upset the current negotiations of Mr Donovon to effect the release

of the Cuban prisoners, and consequently a policy decision might be made at

the highest level to nullify Alpha 66. Further activities of Alpha 66 might

upset political negotiations at the highest level, and reactions might affect

any branch of the government assisting Alpha 66 in any manner.

d. It is interesting to note that Carlos Prio Socarros climbed on

the bandwagon on 14 October and in a radio comment indicated that he was

going to effectively support armed resistance to Castro. If he should begin

contributing lagge sums of money to Alpha 66, and/or engage in similar

group, the PRe.

5.(8) Recommended that :

*. SAOSD present involvement with Alpha 66 be made explicitly

clear to interested Divisions of ACSI.

b. Further utilization of Alpha 66 by USAOSD be clarified by

Operations Branch, Callection Division, in view of the many ramifications.

c. That USAOSD be authorized to exploit Alpha 66.

d. That ONI be contacted for intelligence interest in Soviet UDT

counterneasures.

e. That utilization by General Lansdalels group be investigated.
