effective action in Cuba. According. .to[TEPEDINO CUBELA @U)
desires some sort of, compact equipment with which he can
possibly eliminate CASTRO; j However, CIA keeps offering

him only large, bulfy “unserviéeable material.

£ According to [ZEPEDINO,\ there is now under discuss ioi
some plan to kill FIDEL CASTRO, in which CUBELA will figure.
CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however,
inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY would have no
part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been
brought up again for consideration. President JOHNSON
allegedly is aware of it, and has not ruled against it.
If set in motion, it will be scheduled to occur sometime
before the elections in November.

[TEPEDING told the informant he has not been abl. uj
to learn much more concerning this plan, other than that

CUBELA is supposed to participate, that it is to be
accomplished by men in Cuba, .and possibly someone from
Europe.

ie Ww

The informant advised (TEPEDINO| did not specitica1ighy)
indicate how he had acquired this information; however, the
informant presumed from his manner of speaking that he had

\ obtained it from CUBELA.

since. -both[TEPEDING| and CUBELA are apparently of operational
| interest to CIA, Dissemination would also lead to the
| disclosure of MM 761-S. Although questioned closely, |
MM 761-S was not able to furnish any further details.
