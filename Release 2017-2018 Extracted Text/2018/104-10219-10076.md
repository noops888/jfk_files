DATE OF INFORMATION: 1968-1975
DATE OF DEBRIEFING 1 9 July 1975

This mesorandum is written in response to paragraph 4
of the SE/CI/I requirecents memorandum of 25 June 1975.

1. Source has known William MARTIU since 1968-69,
when Subject noved into a different block of the same apartment
complex in which Source resided in Moscow. About a year ago,
Subject moved to a new apartment on Leninskiy Prospekt, the
exact address of which is unknown to Source.

2. Source, in his talks with Subject, never discussed
the methods of exfiltration used by the Soviets to get Subject
from Washington, D.C. to Moscow.

. 3. Source stated that Subject is certainly watched
constantly by the K.G.B. and that the circle of reprobates
and profligates which has gathered around Subject is infiltrated
by a large number of K.G.B. informers. However, Source could
name no individuals for whom he has more than an intuitive
suspicion of being K.G.B. informers reporting on Subject.
Subject did inform Source that he had Eigned a docunent promising
the Soviet Government that he will not travel more than 30 kins.
outside of Moscow. If Subject is ever found to have traveled
outside this limit, the document provides that he nay be
indicted as a spy solely on that basis.

4. Source could point to no specific evidence indicating
that any other residents of Subject's former ae eee building
were K.G.B. exployees.

5. Source met Subject's colleague in defection,
MITCHELL, only once., The meeting took piace at Subject's
apartment in Source‘s former apartment complex. Source only
knows that MITCHELL is leading a normal life ns a mathematician.
Source described MITCHELL - in comparison with Subject - as a
"normal guy."

6. Source offers only impressionistic accounts of
Subject‘s current lifestyle. Subject continues to live a life
of immorality and wastefulness on the 400 rublo a month dole
he is given by the K.G.B. Although Source can give no specific
evidence of this, he is sure that Subject is constantly
followed by K.G.B. surveillants who will allow him to do
anything except initiate or accept contact with foreign
journalists.
