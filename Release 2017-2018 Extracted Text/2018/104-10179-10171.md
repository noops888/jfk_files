MEMORANDUM FOR: Heary Hecksher

I regret that Iowasn't able to spend nure time on
this case, interesting as it was, I do have sone reservations, c
however, in expressing an opinion on Ray since the files are
not complete and extensive research should be undertaken
first; but even with this reservation I am convinced that one

can see the picture clearly of the hesitation on the part of
offered it was

this Agency to surpert Ray. When support »:
always with some cond:tion, one of which was for Ray to join
the FRD, Although Ray ss a supporter of Cuban-exile

unification, he was not going to be forced into joining the

FRD with threats of son-support.

As you know, Ray was Minister of Public Yorks for Castro
until he resigned his po in August 1359. He hightailed it
into the Escambray Myuntains where he began the now unsuccessful
fight to unseat Castro. Through intermediaries, Ray had
asked the Havana Stataon for military assistance, but in :
almost every instance be was denied this aid. I say almost
simply because the file is not clear on whether we condescended {

and dropped supplies.

Ray's political philosophy is somewhat equivocal, but 7
by-and-large he is strongly for a democratic system of
government and for § economic and socisl reforms. He
reportedly would respect individual liberties and a
representative goverment. He would reportedly maintain close
tics with the United States and remove Communism from Cuba.
Unlike Castro, there is nothing in Ray's background to suggest
that he is a communist or sympathizer. A new government in
Cuba, especially one whose aim is to rid Cuba of Communism,
will, without question, ask the United States for econozic
assistance. I tend to doubt if we will provide this assistance
without some caveat and the question remains then whether Ray
would be willing to accept conditions to United States aid,

I think he will for he will soon realize that without it he
will have no alternative but. to turn to the Soviet Union and

--—I_doubt if he will be wilting to continue the economic and
social chaos now so frevalent in Cuba,

If the decision were minc, I would suggest running an

eperation ctuiliar to the Gre usang ANBIDDY-1, We ‘should

ask Ray to put together @ list of people whom he would select
for certain governaent positions if Castro were overthrown.

It should not take long fur one to determine the type of an.
administration Ray would have. Each of the individuals he
iists could be checked to determine his political feelings
and his feelings toward the United States. This is important.

In any case I would support him if for no other reason

than to test his determination, strength and to gain further
knowledge of his political ambitions.
