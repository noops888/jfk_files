and resultant limited time available for Committee matters

Mr. Kramer.’ This office objected on the grounds of ‘the
sensitivity of the material, the ground rules established
for the Congressional (and DOJ) review of this material

by staffers and the problems which could be. caused. by
exceptional treatment being afforded to one Committée or
staffer. Mr. George Cary provided the compromise. solution
which is acceptable to all parties, to wit, that Mr. Garbler
invite Mr. Kramer to the Agency for lunch after which time
he would review the requested material in the Headquarters
building. (ESVidal)

4. MEETING OF SSCI STAFFER AND DDO: At Mr. Hal
Ford's request a luncheon meeting-with Mr. William Wells
has: been scheduled, for 26 October. Mr. Ford is researching
material fora study on China reporting and wishes to
discuss this subject with Mr. Wells due to his extensive
background and experience in East Asian affairs. ‘(ESVidal)

5. ASSASSTNATIONS COMMITTEE: Counsel .G. Robert Blakey
met with DO, DDA/Security an representatives to
determine how he might frame his requirements to best meet
our capabilitics. ‘His efforts appear to be aimed at the
possible CIA role with the Mafia, and a double Mafia role
with Castro. We has information which implies that
Trafficante was playing both sides. ‘The IG, particularly
Scott Breckenridge, has responsibility for the Bill Harvey
association and the.analysis of the Schweiker report.
Blakey has agreed that.DO will concentrate initially on
the Bayo-Pawlecy affair and the "Soviet Defector" cover
operation. Non identified informants have told him that
Col. "Rep" Robertson was involved. His queries.are
logical, manageable, and, if we can keep his requests to
specific people or events, we should be able to respond
to his requirements. (It would be, in our opinion, an
excellent idea for the ADDO to meet informally with Blakey
over a luncheon. This would be useful in giving Blakey a
picture of JMWAVE, but also ‘it would perhaps’ give Blakey
a perspective on his.own terms of reference. (JDWalker)
