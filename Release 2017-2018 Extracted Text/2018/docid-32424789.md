Eventual liquidation of the Castro/Coramunlat antourage and the climai-

nation of the sovlet presence from Caba," (Tab A) CA set approra-

mately 18 months from June 1963 as the tine frame within which these

objectires could be aubstartially saalised. This tentatus schedule was

bared on the "simultancous, coordinated execution of the individual

UniLY

The intessity of the sabotage program has nover reached the

level plaanod by CIA. O1 18 raids presented lar approval, 10 wero

disapprovad. Of the 8 ralds approved. 3 were abarted due to opera-

donal problers and five were executed. Thase fve raids were

succenatal in the sense that (a) there was substantiel damage to the

tRIgot: (b) all participasta moro nafely recavored, and (6) each was

plausibly dentable, (See Tab Bl las a brtel description of ralds.)

Any 8ss0a91ent of the affoctivanoes of the progIan must be made

against a backgronad of the operational succons as the ralda, the

dacrepascy between the planned and actual levele of intonaity and

the latted duration of the progrant.

In addition to the ClA controlled sabotage, there are too

Deaplte the likallhood that Castro has provided the Sovlete

with evidence of US sponsornhip of sabotage operations againat Cuba,

Soviet reaction has been testrained. Aside from the unual propa-

ganda, we have knowledge of only one sharp sovlet reaction to

The alx point covert program is closely related to other on-

Terminatiora of the Program.

There are two major factors to be considered in terminating

the program. One te the effect it would have on out programs, our

allles and the Communist Bloc. Ibe other le the esdatence of accept-

able alternatives which would accomplias our ulturate objoctives.

The aabotage program la sufficlently interrelatad with our

other overt and covert programs directed againat Caba so that the

effact would be to roduce the lapact of those prograins. With respect

to our allies, and particularly thase lata Americans who are

encouragad by the ballet that tie are condoning or supporting radda

against Cubs, termination could discredit our recognised intent to

renove the Castro regime. This would be particularly true in vies

of developments which have occurred during the last few weeks to

Theat developments include (a) the expectod continustion of bigh sugar

gEnCy plans which would enable us to caplialle on say fastaitous

If they were to be crcâible.

We do sot have sulfleient experience de which to judge the value

of the autoramous programs. Homever, ll they are terminated, a signi-

fIcant anti-US reaction can be expected iron the esdle leadera, In the

event that it la decided to terminate only the ClA-contralled sabotago

pite the greater denlabllity of their actions, could take over entirely

controlled operationa, elther la quantity or quality.

2. Il costinued at lls carrest pace and in the light of recent

evento, the sabotage program la coafancion wilh our other programs,

will accomplish little more than delaying consolidation of the Castrol

3. Il the program la continued and the raids axe persaittod

accomplishlag out artgtral abjactives. At the dame timo the riela

to the US will be increased.

4. Terraloatios al this program will rosalt la detextoration
