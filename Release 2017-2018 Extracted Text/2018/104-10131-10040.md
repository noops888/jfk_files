SUBJECT TARASOFF, Poris D.
Ost 104 8&7
REFERENCE : DES/I05 Memorandum Dated 3 February 1972

Per our 7 February 1972 telephone conversation with
Mr. concerning the contents of the above
Refe ce, WH/l’ reviewed Mr. Taresoff's case. It is our

view tlat since . Tarasofi was under NOC cover prior to
his retirement exico and since his U.S. Government
Eee 083 has nevetgbeen acknowledged publicly, that the

files of(Stone's Mefcantile\should continue to be blocked.
Despite Ms retirement statts, public knowledge of

Mr. Tarasoff's past association with the Agency could
result in embarrass t to the latter. We suggest that
this case be reviewed again in 1973 in order to determine
if,at that time the blocking of the files of (Stone's 24

a reantile \continues to be warranted.
