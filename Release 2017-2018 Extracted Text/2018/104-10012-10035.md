Dear Me. Price:

This is a retyped letter.

•I told in the office

that F-B-I. agente and

Secret Service use police department to harass me.. Police department do

supply pencil of anesthesia

gas to the manager of the building I live. The

manager do or use certain people, to freeze me by anesthesia gas - then push

drugs, poison in my mouth to torture me

- to take my aleep away - or bleed

by rectal and they use many other chemicals to brainwash'me to use me in

political assassination which I refused On January 20, 1976 in Sacramento on

8th and I Streets, man cane to me from police or post office, U.S. Department

of Justice and freeze me by gas and told me to take gun, pistol and we will

tell you where to go to shoot - to kill - Mi. Sargent Shriver.:

- refused.
