and Latin America with orders to place explosives, which they

have, on vessels of nations which trade with Cuba.

One of the

bost neu is in Costa Rica, and the firat act of sabotage

against a vessel may occur there,

He said that the men are

in touch with labor leaders at the ports where they are located.

According to Bosch, he has received a vote of confidence from

members

of the MIRR to

bo

solely responsible for the planning

and execution of the sabotage of ships which will be carried

out by

these men.

Only he can identify the men and their

locations, and

he is the only person who is in touch with

then.

He said

that not even the
