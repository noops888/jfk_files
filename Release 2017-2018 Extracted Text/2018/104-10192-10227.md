Fiold Comment, The MNIRR has for somo timo been planning
to. attack vessels of nations which trade with Cuba,
Besides sabotage on vessels in ports, members of ‘the
MIRR have discussed plans to attack vessels on the high:
seas; Game plans included the use of aircraft as woll as

boats,

On 28 April. 1966 Orlando Bosch Avila, leader of the Movimiento
Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR,
Insurrectional Movement for Revolutionary Recovery), sald

that 20 men were located in various ports in the United States
and Latin America with orders to place explosives, which they {
bave, on vessels of nations which trade with Cuba,~ One of the
best’ men is in Costa Rica, and the first act of sabotage
against a vessel may occir theré, ilo said that the men are

in touch with labor leaders at the ports where they are located, !

According. to Bosch, he has received a voto of confidence from.
nombers of the IRR to be solely responsible for the planning
and execution of the sabotage of ships which will be carried
out by theso men, Only he can identify tho men and their
locations, and he is the only person who ts in touch with
them, He said that not even the executive committee of the |

MIRR knows the identities of the men,

Bosch said that one plan of the MIRR to attack a vessel on the
high seas which was engaged in Cuban trade failed when the
