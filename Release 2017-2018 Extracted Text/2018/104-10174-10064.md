his bag out of a taxi on his return trip

he suddenly felt

a pala in the froln and was afredd that he had a bernia.

On the way to the airport he asked me if thore would be any

chance of the Goverment picking up his medical expenses in the event

that ho actually had a heila which required any substantial treatent,

I tola him at that tine that I did not know what the Goverment's

position would be, but that I would check lato the matter and let his

knoy:

On 2 February, I coatacted

explained the circumstances to bim.

SSA/DDS, and

At that time, I aiso polnted out

that as far as the provisions of his contract vere concerned, it was

stated that he was not an employee of the U.S. Government and while

it did not make specific reference to medical payments while he vas

working for us, it did not specificelly preclude such payments.

opined that although the contract atated ho vee not an

employee of the U, S. Goverment, in actual fact during the period he

vas doing our bidding, be wag.

I went on further to explain to

that in all probability ve will call on Tichbor to do

Future services for us and that while be vas being paid, 1t was doubt.

ful that this reimbursement from us equaled what he vould make in

his regular law practice.

stated that there were a number

of ways that ve could alleviate his situation should it become

necessary.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBTECT: Edward G. Tichborn (P)

On the noming of l September I called Tichborn and arranged

to meet bin at his office at 1230.

As an ettachment to this memo

I have outlined the standerd approach which was folloved in Tichborn's

Instance; therefore, I will not go further into it.

2.

Tichborn struck ne as being extremely quick, Intelligent, very

sympathetic to my suggestions and anilous to cooperate. Be is of

Mexican descent, speaks Nexcan/Spenish fluently and according to hir

can essily pass as a Medcan. Tichborn has spent considerable time

over the yeara in Mexico as vell as attending the University of

Mexico for a year or two. He bas also traveled to Cuba and 1s a

friend of

is personally known to me and

mIght, at sometime, be of ase to us. I shall not delve into Michborn' a

political history as that will be outlined ta bia PRO. Part I when

It arrives.

to brief.

I am also sure that if he was sent out on a TDY he woula

acquit himself in supertor fashion. Mchborn is called upon fron

time to time to give advice on the handling of Mexican/American

problems and show the great appreciation of the difficulties of

dealing with latin Americans, their great sense of politicalmorality,

thelr infertority complex and cl their unfound but nevertheless anti-

Tingo reelings Tichborn vas particularly interested in the situatio

In Cuba and asked my opinion at it.

My comment in essence was that

It seemed pretty obvious that Castro vue extremaly emotional, and

tended towarde being a deniged too had won the ver but vas losing

the peace. Tichbors concurred in this opinion, adding to it that

he felt that Castro vas not cognisep of the dangers of Communten.
