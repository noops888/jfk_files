YMEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Security

THROUGH : Deputy Director, PSI
SUBJECT : Charles William Wiley
#343 S89
1. Attached is examination of the
"Ss" or Sa fund _as it pertains to the request con-
tained in memorandum of 12 April 1974.
2. I concur with analysis and rationale

that there does not appear to be any legal or moral grounds
upon which Wiley can base a claim for reimbursement of the
fund deficit. However, if suspicions are true,
i.e., Wiley is using the funa deficit as a vehicle to
obtain a better settlement, then I feel that the additional
3 al payment to Wiley would he money well spent.

3. Should Wiley be awarded the additional increment,
I would recommend that it be in an amount either slightly
smalier or larger than the amount he claims and he be told
the new amount is an increase in his termination bonus and
not a payment for the fund.

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief, RB/CD

SUBJECT : WILEY, Charles W.

#343 589

REFERENCE : Director of Security Memorandum for the
Record, dated 12 April 1974 on the same
Subject.

l. Referenced memorandum concerns the termination pro-
ceedings relating to Subject and to his apparent claim for reimburse-
ment for an alleged deficit of $7,475.01 in the so-called "SAROYAN"
(or "S") Fund. The Director's memorandum indicated that a review
of the "S' fund will be undertaken in an effort to determine the
validity of WILEY's claim so that prover consideration may be given

iv dls disposi
@ 2. Instant memorandum attempts to relate some of the sig-

: nificant factors which should be considered in arriving at an appro-
priate decision in this matter, Attached hereto are certain research
papers for reference in conjunction with this commentary. A recom-
mendation is contained in the final paragraph herein.

3, WILEY is a Contract Agent of the Office of Security and
functions under the terms of a contract, which has several amend-
ments relating to salary only, effective 1 July 1959. Review of the
contract discloses it to be essentially the standard form for a Contract
Agent. Nowhere does it specifically refer to or even contemplate *
the utilization of such a financial accounting device as a 'SAROYAN'
fund. "Chester E, SAROYAN''is the pseudonym furnished by the
Agency Pseudonym Register for use in the covert handling of WILEY's
records, The contract preamble states that the U.S. Government
contracts with WILEY as an independent contractor for the submission
of certain information and related services of a confidential nature.

In the paragraph on Status, WILEY is advised that he is not an
employee: the U.S. Government under this agreement and is not
entitled.tofpny benefits normally incident to an employee status. In

ieee

& addition to his basic compensation he was to receive 5% additional
salary in licu of insurance, retirement, medical and health pro-
grams, etc, Regarding Travel, the contract states that WILEY
will be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary expenses incur-
red in connection with such op. tional travel as may be directed

or authorized by the Government, This may include per diem in
lieu of subsistence in the course of such travel and while on tempor-
ary duty away from New York, N.Y. Payment and accounti
such expenses will be in substantial conformance with ap
Government regulations, As to Operational nses, it states

that WILEY will be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary
operational expenses as specifically approved and financially

limited by the Government, Such funds will be subject to payment
and accounting in substantial conformance with applicable Govern-
ment regulations. A standard paragraph on Offset reflects that if
WILEY should receive any financial emoluments required under the
terms of this agreement from or through a cover facility, such
emoluments will be used to offset those due WILEY under this agree-
ment by the Government, Such emoluments thus received from or

thrangh » caver faciiity ore antnowierged and agreed to bet rant
by the Government within the provisions of this contract, It is the

@ opinion of this writer that this proviso does not refer to the type of
activity engaged in by WILEY whercin he operated independently and
not for a cover firm, It could not be reasonably maintained that i
was the intention of the Office that his income for the last thirteen
years was to be limited to the maximum of his salary. Another
standard paragraph covers Unauthorized Commitments and states
that no promises or commitments pertaining to rights, privileges
or benefits other than those expressly stipulated in writing in this
agreement or any amendment thereto shall be binding on the Govern-
ment,

4, The aforementioned contract is broad enough and flexible
enough to permit the payment of such expense claims as WILEY sub-
mitted and were approved and authorized by this Office. It is some-
what difficult to trace the evolution of the "S" fund through its various
stages. There does not appear to have ever been any firm set of
instructions established and/or conveyed to WILEY--certainly not in
written form, The fund's handling changed through the years as did
WILEY's activities and his headquarters handlers, It was intended,
Peo rgoates: that WILEY would establish his own cover as an

e@ "SEP 80 1975
CiA

HW 50955 DocId:32203891 Page 4


independent researcher, writer, lecturer, etc, This obviously
would and did generate income. In order to build his natural
cover and increase his capability and potential value to the Office,
in the carly years overseas travel was not only permitted but was
encouraged. Separate travel allowances were authorized and in
several instances advances were given to enable WILEY to under-
take the trips. No advance for overseas travel nor any separate
travel vouchers were approved and paid by the Finance Division
after 1964. He either secured separate funding from other out-
side sources, including foreign governments, for at least part of
his expenses or covered them hiresclf and charged all or part of
the expense off against his outside income as reported in his '"'S"
fund accountings.

5. The first rendition of an "'S" fund was for the period,
12/59-6/60 and it indicates he had had no prior outside income,
It should be noted that this pre-dates establishment of his firm,
World News Analysis (WNA). WNA, when established in January
1961, supplied WILEY only a portion of his cover. In addition to
- inal arvice, he operated as a Jecturer, photo-
grapher, writer, and in the years aiier 1"
public relations promoter, also.

argely ¢ nln

6, From October 1959 to February 1964, travel vouchers
were submitted to this Office, authorized, and payment made in
cash to an SRS representative for transmittal to WILEY. These
vouchers covered primarily stateside travel, phones, operational
lunches, etc. In June 1964, the system was changed to enable
direct payment into WILEY's New York bank account and the first
such payment made covered his travel voucher for the period, 2/1-
5/30, 1964.

7. No "S" fund accounting was rendered for the fisca}
years 7/62-6/63 and 7/63-6/64; however, commencing with the
calendar year 1964, annual calendar year accountings were re-
ceived, In April 1965, a travel voucher for the period 7/1-11/15,
1964 was received, After some discussion about its merits be-
tween E. MENDOZA and C/SRS, WILEY was told to take reimbu
ment from the "S"' fund. Apparently WILEY had no advance wa
that this change was to occur, After some further discussion and
“hold-up pt jis travel vouchers for the first six months in 1965, they

ea

were all approved b nd paid by Finance Division

to WILEY's bank account, Subsequent to June 1965, all expenses
incurred, and/or claimed by WILEY, domestic and overseas, have
been charged against the "S"' fund income and no separate reimburse-
ments have been made from Agency funds. The records reflect,
however, an intention that WILEY would submit these expense claims
frequently and regularly for approval. By 1967 this had disintegrated
into merely an annual return and WILEY's figures were not seriously
questioned. The rationale would seem to have been that he was going
through an exercise which involved pretty much an’ accounting for
his own income and expenditures.

8, The figures utilized herein were necessarily essentially
supplied by WILEY, either in receipts, vouchers or reports. There
is and was apparently little opportunity for either pre-expenditure or
post-expenditure confirmation or approval of most expenses listed.
WILEY had a natural cover and worked under uncontrolled conditions
in an area remote from Agency Headquarters. This was particularly
true after 1966 when he submitted only annual accountings. While

aypendimres may Have actually Uceu made, ther & #
@ is even less now, little real possibility to determine the reason tor
the expenditures.and for whose benefit they were undertaken, Jt would
seem that his figures were accepted and deemed to be part of his
general activities and therefore part and parcel of his natural cover.
Some could have been purely personal and non-business related in any
sense, but to assume this is to question WILEY's honesty.

9, WILEY's income tax returns were assumed to be, hopefully,
honest and reasonably accurate. His federal return (Form 1040)
Schedule C-Profit or Loss From Business or Profession (Sole Pro-
prietorship) generally reflects his business activity to be "Writer,
Photographer, Broadcaster, Lecturer. " No business name is listed.
His business address is his home. In 1967 and earlier he also in-
cluded "Research" as an activity and showed the business name to be
his own name.

10. As his charges as expenses were left largely to his own
discretion, so was his rendering of his "income" necessarily accepted
at face value. There is and was little possibility to audit or check
a these figures. Various receipts and papers were submitted to support
Ceci é many hy fypse listed but there is and was no way to confirm whether all

SEP 20 1975

GIA “

HW 50955 DocId:32203891 Page 6


jncome was shown. Nor was there any way of ascertaining whether
or not he made any genuine effort to produce “outside'' income, An
Office memorandum in June 1967 states that WILEY said his wife
told him that he could make a million dollars in public relations work
if he promoted something in which he was really interested. Also,
that WILEY said that that was true because he had not had his heart
in his recent work for us and, now, he plans to start selling America.
It is believed that much of his time since 1967 was expended in
domestic activities of the nature of those being generated by or
actively supported by the National Committee For Responsible
Patriotism (NCRP), of which WILEY has been the prime mover. It
js understood that for at jeast some of his work with NCRP, he drew
remuneration. This does not appear in the '"'S" fund income (WILEY

has stated that he didn't feel that we would consider it appropriate
for him to include it therein) and itis impossible for this office to
ascertain whether he included it on his federal income tax returns
as he just shows a gross income figure on his Schedule C. WILEY
was specifically advised on at least one occasion, py letter on 27
January 1964, that his taxable incorne should include all checks
£ ary and in cddition the
e yeturn must include all outside income. We have no knowledge
whatsoever relative to any income tax return accounting at other
than the federal level. On those occasions where overseas travel
was involved after 1965, while WILEY was not denied permission
: to travel, he was told that financing would be his own problem, It
i should be noted that overseas trips have resulted in expenses being
charged to the "'S" fund, In most cases, the trips were followed by
i articles in the media and he has continued to give lectures through
the years, obviously drawing on these trips for background. Income
i was generated, therefore, from his travels put it would be well-nigh
: impossible to render a valid cost-accounting on any specific trip to
determine whether it ultimately resulted in an expense,

woecived fx

ll. Itis believed that WILEY has no "paper" which would
reflect that this Office has any legal obligation to reimburse him for
the deficit he now shows in bis Final SAROYAN Fund accounting, nor
does there appear to be any such paper in office records, As anin-
dependent contractor, he has been almost completely free of control
py, this Office. He has on » .umber of occasions indicated in advance,
Hi in enaieearet that he contemplated such as overseas trips. It
: must be conceded that had this Office made strong objection, he would

& C3 5

HW 50955 DocId:32203891 Page 7


have altered his plans, to comply with Office considerations. On

an Official Routing Slip in July 1971, C/SRS noted "WILEY has
established 2 certain image as part of his cover which makes his
participation in these things alrnost mandatory. In other words

he can't be a ‘little bit pregnant’. "" The foregoing was in refer~
ence to some of WILEY's stateside activities but is believed repre-
sentative of the Office attitude. As to the fund balances and deficits,
it seems highly unlikely that had WILEY shown a large plus final
balance, that this Office would have given any consideration as to
whether we had either a legal or moral claim to such a balance but
would have deemed the balance to be rightfully WILEY's.
Budget and Fiscal Branch, Office of Security has indicated
that such is his opinion,

12, The same reasoning as stated above applies to any Office
moral obligation to reimburse WILEY for his alleged deficit "SAROYAN"
fund balance. It is believed, but this is conjectural, that WILEY does
not really believe that he is entitled to such a payment but merely
hopes that this claim has enough reason and stature to give him more

Joverc 7 toward 2 bermer termination s

iilemeut, ile Las Vials

@ acknowledged that he probably has no legal claim, It is believed
that, despite the fairly substantial size of the alleged deficit in recent
years, at no time did WILEY prior to the termination discussicrs,
request that the Office provide funds to eliminate the deficit nox did
he even inquire as to the feasibility of such an action. An added
factor, however, which may have some significance is that, although
these "S" fund accountings have been received annually, there does
not seem to have been any direct comment to WILEY regarding either
their character or the plus and minus balances he has shown therein.

13. Consideration must be given to the actual or apparent
significance of tendering WILEY any amount which is or would seem
to be, in response to his alleged claim. Should an amount closely
approximating his claimed deficit be offered WILEY, unless it were
carefully delineated in writing to be other than restitution for the
alleged "S"' fund deficit and so acknowledged by WILEY that it repre-
sented a termination bonus and that he had no other claims against
the Agency, the Agency might be placed in the position of seeming
to have honored his claim, This would be unwise in that it might at

~ east appear that the Agency had willfully supported some of those
RECERaepenccis idertaken domestic activities and overseas trips that

SEP 90 1975

CIA

NW 50955 DocId:32203891 Page 8


would be embarrassing to the Agency if publicly surfaced. It is also
possible that WILEY then might seck to also garner the $4,000, 00
terminal bonus first offered him,

14, It is the writer's belief that WILEY's reluctance to accept
the previously offered termination bonus is primarily motivated by
his desire to obtain as favorable a settlement as he can possible
mancuver out of the Agency, and, while he fully understands that
revelation of his past relationship with the Agency could be a source
of some embarrassment and concern, he does not have any intention
or desire to make any public disclosure of same, The writer cannot
assess what WILEY's mood and reaction will be, if at some time in
the future, it becomes patently evident to him that the Agency has
surfaced him to Congressional Committees. It is suggested that an
offer of some figure between $7,000.00 to $10,000.00 could be nego-
tiated for a total final release of all claims by WILEY at the present
time, He could also be advised that no claim will be made by this
Office for any of the office equipment, fixtures, library materials,
and photo equipment which he may have and to which there may bea

1, Tax and Saroyan Fund

Clarified items appearing in Saroyan Fund annual
statement, which is attached hereto, aloAg with rough statement on

—Saroyan-wasedvised_that all finance-statements

appear acceptablé. Deficit figure carried over from 1963 has tobe 9 >

s accepted--no annual statement was received by me, Note present a,
Fund is $1257. oe L-

—

: ew of Subject's plan ‘fo attend the Youth testival
a in August, I suggested Saroyan not repay us the $1000 advance for the
; China trip, but keep it until he is assured of complete outside financing
for the Algiers trip. He would, as in the past, utilize this fund to
cover any deficit for his own travel costs, not for any of the group
which he supervises at the Festival.

2. Overseas Trip

i

|

i Subject asked what the reaction would be to his ex-

i tending his fravel in August, to spend perhaps a month in South Ameri
! Lasked about the financing and he, as usual, refers to the Saroyan Fund.
{ He says that he hopes to secure further returns from his work in con-
i
1

nection with the China trip and he feels he could cover all expenses.
He mentioned taking what would be considered his ''two weeks leave"
while on this travel, so the entire travel period would be six weeks,

: I told him to discuss this with you further if time
nits on Wednesday or to set out details in writing.

Saroyan - Travel Vouchers

f
Attached is #6 is the series of travel vouchers, covering period
1 Jamary - 30 June 1965, wnich I feel need scme approval other
than mine.

On this particular voucher, there are four separate items for
reimbursement for er ertainzent or operational m ls, totaling $15.09,
with'details"thereon shown on 5x8 attachment. i
on Voucher #6 apply similarly to the obher five still-unprocessed

vouchers?

1. Re Oliver Davidson

I have no idea what the com ee si

gency inform
fessional bum who wants a career in spy.ng, as De

indicated in his correspondence with CIA. I advised Saroyen
to stay avay from Davidson as he appeared to have nothing 2
which Saroyan could venefit. To date I have seen novhing
would change my opinion. It might be interesting to se? sone
current reports on Davidson or some detail on what he and Saroy
are involved in.

2, Re entertainment of YAF crowd

Since I levied requirement on Saroyan that he furnisn us the
names of persons being wined and dined (Sareh 1965), it is
interesting to note that the same people urn up on ths Lists.
Good exemple is the YAF crowd, described by Saroyan 6S "lead
I question the description since none of thepersons listac have
any position in wy in any material [nave seen. Fur
Bill Gardiner is @ long-tine personal friend of Saroyan who is
employed on one of the railroads and who is used by Saroyaa in
developinz photogrephs, etc. when Saroyan is busy. (Gardiner
FRO Mestentety is aware of Saroyan's CIA employment.)
