• letter sent fron Paris by Carlos Jorge ROBRENO, aka "El Mago",

3.

Details of Meeting.

on 27 Feb, A/1

called the writer via sterile

phone to say that he had received a letter from ROBRENO (R)

postmarked 25 Feb., Paris,

In one paragraph, R atated that he

had been given several "encargog" from AMAISH for A/l to be

"transmitted personally" (see attached copy of letter).

Since

the above information was not mentioned in the clear over the

phone, it was decided that the writer should meet with &/l in

order

to see the letter personally and to guide A/l in any

subsequent steps. The writer arrived at A/l's office at

oa 1240, 28 Feb.

It was A/l'a impression that the "encargos»

ofted in the letter included things beyond personal requests,

but he was not absolutely certain of this interpretation due

to the brevity of the paragraph.

To resolve this expeditlously

as requested in the letter,

it was decided that A/l should call

Paris and talk directly with R, avoiding, of course, any phone

call to the Cuban Embassy there.

To achleve this,

was necessary to call Luis FERNANDO? Ruiz, aka "El Inglais

(5), at GAL-9913) and ask him to got in touch with Luis Enrique

TIm AN 0 2/10 New York. No interest of an opa nature

who in turn could pass a message to R asking

was revealed here, as the Paris group was told only (and

truthfully) that R had written to A/l in New York and that part

of his letter was unclear in its meaning,

thus A/l wished to

talk directly

with R in order to clarify this.

(A phone call

was not at all unusual in this case, given A/l'e normally

extensive use of the phone, plus the fact that the letter

Indicated some urgency and

did not include a return address..

FERNANDEZ readily agreed to the request even though it was

after 2200 Paris time. A/l waited in his NYC office until

In roply, A/l agreed that there may be some

cause for concern, but in laot he was not too apprebeneive es

say that by this he meant that both men hed been for a long

time assoolated with the otroles In whih AMLASH had been a

leader, and could be regarded as "loyal" to AMlASIl. However,

he did

*peculate that both men were perhapa oloser Iriends

with each other then either was with AMLASII. A/1 also

stated that both AMLASH and he did not personally care for the

two men (R and IBARHA), but that AlASHl did feel that at least

R was a good "aotion type" and could probably be fitted into

AMLASH & plane at some point.

(This was reported also in A/1

a8 much the snarter of the two; IBARRA being not too intelligent.

A/1 also stated that both sen drank quite a bit, turning

Into belligerent and talkative drunks.

over-indulgence,

with its resulting belicosity, was undoubtedly

responsible for
