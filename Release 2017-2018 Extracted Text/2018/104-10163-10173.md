MRR for the month of June 1965

1.

On the basis of the discussion on 27 May between

Chief,

WH and Manuel Artime,

we are currently in the process

of subnitting a recommendation to the 303 Committee that we

maintain contact with Artime and render support to him on a

modest basis.

Hls monthly operating budget, which be sub

mitted to us,

would enable him to kees the MRR alive ag a

recognized exile political organization, and would allow him,

personally, to maintain his status as an important exile

lender.

This would, in turn, continue his access to beads of.

tate and other leading political figures in latin AmeriCa.

?. Pending action by the 303 Committee, it 1e recommended

that you grant approval to fund Artime and the MRA for the

month of June 1965, on the basis of the following budget

estimate:

CORANDUN FOR THE RECORD

-SUBJECT:

Contact of Manuel Artime with Professor, George

Lodge and with Col. Barrienton of Bolivia

I talked with Manuel Artime by phone the night

Te dune

le said he had received a call from Professo

Lodgo that afternoon but as not at home to talk with him.

(Thia was obviously a follow-up from tle offer made to

Artime by Chiet,

WH to put him and Lodge together on his

proposed civie action activities. I told him there vas

no reason ho should not return the call and arrange for a

mooting with Lodge at their mutual conventence.

S. Artine said that as his fire: reaction, but

botore he could make the call another message had come in

from Col. Barrientos of Bolivia anting it ho could visit

the country for the benefit of his advice and counsel and

offering to send a Bolivian Air Force plane to pick hia up

and bring him to La Paz.

I asked if he were acquainted

with Barrientos or an expert on Bolivia and he said he icew

no more

about cither of them than what he had read in the

papers.

He had no idea of the reason for the invitation,

but wanted to check with us and find out if we had any

roqulrements for him in case we wanted him to make the vistt.

I told him I would check with Chief, Wi next morning and

call him back.

On the morning of 5 June I called Artine.

He said

Professor Lodge had called him at 0700 that morning and told

him he was interested in sotting together with him.

Lodge

maid he would be in Paname on 14 June, and Artime said he

planned to be travelling in that area at that time and could

•asily meet him there.

Artime told Lodge he was willing to

make a trig to fusion to see him earlier and that after such

• preliminary nesting, the next meeting in Panama would probably

I be more useful.

Lodge seemed delighted and invited Artime

I sugreated to Artime that

Artime said he had found out the background of the

One of Barrientos

trusted

aides had been to Washington or New York and in passing

through Mital enroute home heard a MRR radio broadcast

mbout countering subversion, civic action, etc. that

attracted his attention.

There was also a brief analysia

of the situation in Bolivia which appealed to him as the

best-balanced hehad heard.

He thereupon started asking

questions about the MRA and Artime and was

referred to one

Artime's people who turned over

some copies of "Tridente"

(magazine of the MRi).

The alde remarked that he was going

to report to Barrientos of his discovery of a Cuban exile

mroup that seemed knowledgeable of Castro and Communist

subversion operations and had some useful ideas of how to

counter them.

Two days later Artime received the invitation

from Barrientos.

ACTOR BEGUIND • MEPERENCE

Action Required: None. For Your Information.

The ANOTe have recently subnitted two short reports

providing some information about AMNORLD and AMBIDDY-1. activitIes.

AMOT-81 reported the following in Report DD-1414, 19 May

1965, which he had acquired from Iden A, whoße ultimate source of

information was AMVORLD-?:

AIWORLD 2 left for New York with hia family on 15

My 1965,

this being his first step towards disconnecting

himself from ANWORLD.

Before he left,

he handed over to

AMBIDDY-I the AMWORLD money which he had in the bank.

ANWORLD-? said that AMBIDDY-1 was devoting all his

attention to obtaining money by the sale of militiry equipment

which he had at the camps.

AMBIDDY I had already realized

U.S. $30,000 in this manner and hoped to raise still another

330,000.

AMBIDDY-I currently had all the AlWORLD money under

him absolute control and said he intended to act as treasurer

of the organtzation.

AKSIDDY-I gave the impression of not being involved

with any political plan.

Occasionally he talked to friends

about Interviews with his "contacts" and about & budget for

propagands. Other times he gave consideration to propositions

of friends, such as the Spaniard who acts as his chauffeur

and secretary, concerning varlous business deals.

He also talka

of buying a farm in Nicaragua to cultivate rice, etc.

The general opinion within AMWORLD is that the

organization is entering & crisis and, with the separation of

AMORED A fron the osganisation, AFORLD members would no

Jongor continue tu receive their aalaries.

Meetings with ANJAVA A in Washington, 27-28 June 1965

Subject: Proposed Agency Programs

1.

Following the demise of AMORLD, AMJAVA has become

familiar vith three other Agency programs, or proposed programs,

and he asked if' be could have some clarification as to just

what ve wanted from him and his people.

I explained that there ver

three different functions which needed to be done and that the

Aponey was trying to develop programs to meet each need.

The

three functions concerning Cuba are:

(a) to maintain the MRR me a respected resistance.

organiention with a political posture

which is acceptable to most

Cubans and not inimical to U.S. interests.

We are asking approval of

" inu budget for subaidy of the ARR which will pay for its

published and radio publicity matter, subsistence to survivors of

MRR killed, disabled, or captured,

and travel expenses for. AMBIDDY-!

ns the lender of the movement outside Cuba.

We are trying to

rulde A» Into a program of Community Development/ Civic Actlon

projects in Latin America as « means of projecting an image of

the

MRR and of A-l as constructive, forwerd-looking people instead of

Bimply exile counterrevolutionarles.

We would hope that auch

not vittes would keep the movement together, give the membera

practical enerience which would

eventually

be useful in Cube, and

In the moantine, would render useful results in countering

problems of insurgency in Latin America.

'(D) to prepare a managerial and executive team of

upocinlly selected Cuban exiles who would be reidy to move into Cuba

mhould relations be resuned with the Unitad States in order to

turniah effective direction of neceseary governmental functions and

188.8t the. United States in denying the island to Communist

control.

Selected candidates would, hopefully, be fairly young

ma well as intelligent and capable

of profiting from extensive

tralning programs which would be designed for cach to prepare him

to perform a specific function in a future Cuban regime. : The

program would be apolitical, each person being considered as an

Individuml and not as representative of any

organization.

This

(It was explained that tos vas

the program handled by Mr.

Tom Clines of SOD, who was present and

discussed it more in detail with A 4.)

A 4 understood that the programs outlined above mate

only parts of an overall concept concering Cuba, that the first vas

designed to meet long-ter political considerations, the cond

ot meet long-term strategic requirements, and the third to neet

current operational needs.

He understood and completely agreed

with each program, and agreed to cooperate in executing oath of

them, to the maximus of his ability.

He will be happy to spot and

recruit for us in each program, and will try to influence. AMBIDDY-I

A-d appreciated.pur

now that he understoud what we were trying to accomplish.

•BORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

ВОВЛЕСТ:

Meeting with George Lodge, Harvard School

of Business

1.

on 15 July 1965, with

_01 CA Stall,

I met Mr. Lodge at the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel to discuss.

what he knew about thi relations among AMBIDDY-1, Bishop

McGrath of Panana, and a rural development program they are

all working on in Panama.

Mr. Lodge described Bishop McGrath

as a real ball of fire, about 39 or 40 years old, born of

U. S. parents in the Canal. Zone but he has taken Panama

citrenship.

He gradunted from Notre Dame University, did

graduate work in Rome and has taught in soreral European:

und Intin American untversities,

such as in Chile,

He Is

one of the three top Catholic prelates in Latin America

and has extremely close ties with the Vatican, O. Be, he de

on the Ecumenical Council and on the birth control group. He

has an official operating budget of $2,000 per year which he

"ugmente from every conceivable source, particularly from the

German bishops.

He is politically and operationally minded

an American copletely in his attitude and behavior, a

sypical Irish politician, Mr. Lodge submitted somewhat

wryly.

His parents are retlred and live in Miami where he

visite often.

• He rocently met AMBIDDY-1 tbore on two occasions.'

On this sano visit he also: met the Papal Nuncio from Santo

Domingo (he appears to receive most of the hot potato type

maignments in his part of the world).

Veraruas Province of Panama is a selected testing

ground for community development progzana in rural areas.

I: in tha joorest and most hopeless province of Panama,. &

mall armed uprising took place there in 1958 and wee put

dori.

The Communists have their beat organization in Panama

in this province.

The program there in based on the village

of Ian Francinco, about 10 miles off the highway, and ie an

expansion of the efforts of the parimh priest Father VASQUET

Pinto who has been thereabout 10 years.

He is a dynamic

young man who has. lead the villagers to schild thoir village

and church to develop their land and organize a cooperative

and small credit facilities.

The village is only 1,200

people but they raised by themselves $1,000 to buy materials

and then built a training center capable of bousing, feeding

and training 60 men at a time in rural cooperatives and rural

development

One

of their ideas is to select bright looking

leaders and potential leaders from rural

areas, first in

Panana and later, hopefully, from other nearby countries

for visits of a few days in which. they hope to brain-wash

them of Communist type propaganda they may have beard and

show them what can actually be done so they can take the

good word with them to their own communities.

This 1a in

addition to the regular formal course. of 4 months for

selected young potential leaders fron rural communitles in

Panam and all over Latin America.

3.

Another leading light in the program is Father

Steele who was thrown out of Dominica by Trujillo for

organizing cooperatives and is a recognized authority on

the subject.

Father Steele uses

Veraguas as a home base

but travels

to Chile, Colombia and other countries conducting

short training courses on the ground.

There are some Dutch

priests on the staff whom Bishop McGrath personally recruited.

Inther Vasquez Pinto has sent about 10 to 15 local boys to

the Antigonish School in Nova Scotia and they are back for

Lodge describes

the group as a highly motivated

and energatic group and Father Vasquez Pinto as a young and

offective Panamantan priest who is a good operator.: Mr. Lodge

has two men from Harvard University there to study the

program and assist in any way they can.

The Peace Corps has

51 people in the Central Provinces of Panana; about 30 of

then in Veraguas Province.

They cooperate with the center,

In fact the two Harvard men are interviewing each of the.

Peace Corps volunteers about their work.: Ir. Lodge said they

aro coming up with some good information and ideas which other

wine would be lost as there is a good deal of experience

mong the Peace Corps kids but they don't know to recognize

Its significance or how to orgentre 11 into useable form.

The above group la trying to organize the center As

&

vimblo base with an effective staff to continue the craiuing

program even 1f the present leaders should move on.

They

1t will become a pilot program for Latin America and

that they will be able to seed other similar prograna from

this one.

They hope to be able to spot and develop leaders

In remote arcas for future operations in those areas.

Incidental to these major objectives, they are also helping

to develop the economy of Veraguas, to develop production,

transport to markets, credit facilitles, and in general to

help alleviate grievances hich the Commniats have exploited

in the past.

Bishop

McGrath has arranged with AKIDDI-! for about

BIN OfAMBIDDY-l's people to attend the January 1966 training

course, with 3 or 4 to remain on the staif.

Hopefully, One

of them will develop into the executive director of the

conter. It was agreed that the first min will not be too

closely associated in the public oye wits AlBIDDY-l in order

to try to forestall initial bad publicity fren opposition

elements.

AMBIDDY-l and Bishop McGrath agreed, therefore,

that Nestor IZQUIERDO (who is well known as a long-time

adherent of AHBIDDY1 from 1958-59 Comandos Rurales days

in Oriente) would not be assigned to the Panama center at

this time. AMBIDDY-I told Bishop McGrath that he would try

to obtain sufficient funds to support the men assigned to the

center.

He has not yet brought up this matter with his case

officer, and as the amounts will be very small, he may try to

squeeze

it out of his newly authorized budget.

However, he

my ask the Agency for additional holp to sponsor these men

while they are working their way into the program.

It 18

Intended that the Cubans would continue to cooperation in the

program, eventually working them into the field werever they

no needed and acceptable.

Mr.. Lodge will meet Bishop McGrath next in Panama

on

29 or 30

July.

•As. a. colncidence AMBIDDYI will probably

be An or near Panama around the same time, as he left 14 July

for Nicaragua, Costs Rica and Panama for meetings with their

presidents and several days visit in each country.

DOC. MICHE. DER

In latr July 1965 members of the AMLILAC Group re

ported the following information as a result of their contacts

with various members of AHYUM located in the JIWAVE area..

AMBIDDY-I has a warehouse in the WAVE area in

which he is storing equipment brought back from his Central

American base.

The equipment includes UDT gear, boat motors,

rafts, uniforms, and bulldozers. There are no weapons. in the

building.

AMBIDDY-1 is planning to put the BABUN PC into

proper condition for use as a Mother Vessel.

The vessel is

now in Tampa. AMBIDDY-I spent over $10, 000, on this ship

Inat Jear.

AHLILAC-B, & fOrmer AHLILAC who was fired a

couple of years ago and

who has been with AMBIDDY-I's group

mince then, war: in the local area recently and told AMLILAC-6

thut A-8 was the caretaker at one of the Bases in Central

Amonica along with & other men.

He stated that they had all

the weapons from the last effort and were preparing the camp

for re-activation.. AMBIDDY-1 told A-8 that $500, 000, was

wallable for the reactivation.

The penchant of PBRUMEN exties for exasgeration,

and contortion of information (as can be

meen from para

collected by the AlLILAls - tend to affect the latters" morale

and confidence in KUBARK because

the AlbILACs believe that

anythirg ANBIDDY-1 does is done with KLBARk support and blessing.

As Headquarters is aware the great fear of the LILACs is that

AMBIDDY -I will get all the action and all the glory.

However,

in view of the current KUBARK/ABIDLi- relationship the

AMLILACs have little to fear and a renered morale crisis is not

expected to arise.

On the other hand, 1f ABIDDi-I vere to

Te activate part of his action force

and conduct a raid utilizing

mOn-KUBARK support, that would be another matter.

It would then

be very difficult to convince the AMLILACs that KUBARi was not

Involved and their morale and confidence would be badly shaken.

This situation is brought to your attention simply to show what

effect such AVBIDDY-1 activities would have on this Station's

painstaking efforts

MEMORANDU FOR THE RECORD

FROM : AMBIDDY/1 - 23 Augist

1965

SUBJECT:

AMBIDDY/l discussions with General Anastasio

SOMOZA, President SCHICK and other Nicaraguan

officials, 21 Ju1-20 Aug 1965.

1. A/1 first net with General SOMOZA 27/28 July.

The following points were made in these discussions:

General SOMOZA sald the State Department 1g

making an Investigation of how much money he is using to control

the government and win the next presidential elections.

SOMOZA

told A/l that he intended to run and fully expected to win the

election,

but would not

need to buy any votes.

He asked A/l to

please tell

"Washington" that State is very clumsy and if they

really want to know ansthing they should eall on the Agenckid®

the FBI, either of which is much more effective.

everybody in Managua knows about State's efforts to block his

candidacy and are laughing at then.

SOlOZA snid he was meeting Dantel ODUBER of

Conta Rica at the border shortly, and they would maise a "non-

Isgression pact" agreeing that neither will make trouble for

the other's campaign for election to Presidency.

ODUBER had

naked for the interview.

SOMOZA told A/l that he thought

CDUBE: had made a

"live and let live" sgreement with the Com

munists, and that at their meeting, he would demand from ODUati

• publie denunciation of the Communiats to be followed by

aLractive control

measures. against them.

The MRE will be allowed to build and operate

a mall boatyard for construction, maintenance and repair of

mhrimp boats at Bluefields without solozA or the Nicaraguan

Government to be cut into the proceeds.

mis is part of A/1'g

community development progrem, sined at developing a large

I1shing cooperative. based on Blueflelds which will be solf-

d. General SOMOZA, at N/l's strong recommendation,

agreed to start pushing Civic Action programs through the National

Guard in an effort to enhancc his personal image preparatory to

the nest Presidential campaign. SOHOZA asked A/l to assist and

The

nest meeting with General SOMOZA by A/I was

on & August, with

following points:

# .

SOMOZA said that the latest program of Fidel

CASTRO 1a targetted against Nicaragua, Costa Rice and Panama.

Par: of the plan includes assassination of the presidents of

the three countries as part of a terror campaign to soften

then up

He sald that In Panama, particularly, President

Marcos ROBLES is a prime target but the Communists are exploiting

• recent turn against him by the National Guard because he has

cut down on their costs, pensions, and other privileges.

ROBIEs 1s eliminated from power, the Communists feel the chief

of tha National Guard will take over and they think they:

can handle him more easily than they can ROBLES.

Source for above, according to SOMOZA, was a

close associate of Marcial AGUILUZ, whom he described as the

top

Communist in Costa Rica and one who had recruited (Inu) FONSECA,

• Nicaraguan now living in Mexico.

FONSICA is a bastard son of

one of SOMOZA's foremen,

a Communist, ard an agent working

directly under order of

Fidel CASTRO.

1/1 and SOMOZA talked again about a Civic

Action program in Nicaragua and SOMOZA said again that he would

support 1t.

He will assign Father LUGO, & Cuben priest who

served with the Bay of Pigs forces, to a position similar to a

chaplain in the National Guard in order to assist in the program.

SOMOZA will support MRR community development programs with

whataver authorizations are required and with whatever official

or personal prentige he may offer.

9. M/l next returned to lanagua on 17 August and met

u1th Major PERE, of the Nicaraguan Custons Service, & personat alde

to the Ceneral.

Pints Bald SOnorA was very anery not at A/1 or

his pecolo

and difficult to see

He said 3 Colonels were under

arrest for i daya each for disobeying orders.

PEREZ was afraid

to nee SONOZA for fear he might be arrested

niso.

However, A/1

sallod ScuCrA by phone and was invited to viat him next day

at Tipitapa.

A/l met him the next day (18 Aug) and had lunch

with SOMOZA and (Inu) BENITEZ, & Puerto RiCar,

former politician

he now in business but remains in contact with and

working for the V. 8. Coverament. After lunch, BENITIl left

and A/1 went with SOMOZA in his car. Thile they vere riding,

SoMozA told A/l why he was so angry.

d.

A message had recently come to General

SOmOZA from the

Nicaraguan Ambassador in Panama saying that he

had it from authoritative sources thal. the U.S. not only

would not support his candidacy for the Presidency, but would

strongly oppose it.

In addition, SOlOZA had word

that Sydney

ROSS, Director of El Tempo (Spanish language newspaper in

New York), after a recent interview with Asst. Secretary Jack

Vaughn of

the State Department, had an off-the-record talk

with VAUGHN after the

interview.

VAUGHN had said that, so far

Is he was concerned, SOJOZA was no different from the other

Latin American dictators such as TRUJILLO, PERON, DUVALIER.

STROESSNER, Col. LOPEZ, or GeD. CASTELL Branco, and that be

could certainly

not support installing: another

military dictator

in Nicaragua®

The two reports were confirmatory in SOMOZA'S

mind and made hin feel extremely bad as he said he has always

talked favorably about the U.S. and tried to cooperate with them

at every chance.

SOMOZA checked with the U.S. Ambassador In

Nicaragua (whether in person or by

sending Pres. SCHICK was

not made clear) about the matter, and received a typical State

Department reply that the U.S. was neutral in Nicaraguan internal

mifairs and would take no action about the elections. The

Ambassador said he could not believe VAUGHN could have made

much statements because of the U.S. position of neutrality in

Hicaraguan affeirs.

1.

SOMOZA also said he had sent a message to

Washington suggesting that if some of the other countries heard

mbout themselves being lumped with TRUJILLO, PERON, etc.

they

might well call back their troops from Santo Domingo and tell

• Washington to go to hell.

He said he was going sherd with his plans

regardless of what the U.S. does about it and reminded A/1 of

Mr. J. C. KING's talk with him (SOMOZA) at the airport in

Wamhington to let him know after the matin attack on the

SIERRA ARANZAZU that Washington would undersiand 1$ SOMOZA

decided to kick A/1 and hia camps out of Nicaragua.

He used

this as an example of an attempt from Washington to dictate

to him which he

had ignored,

telling A/l that he was a friend,

would continue to he, and would continue to make his own

decisions regardless of what Washington might want from bim.

A/1 made another strong augestion that SOMOZA take off his.

uniform and start making public his civic action ideas.

In

addition, he again advised him to go peracually to Washiagton

SECHET

to talk directly with VAUGHN and other U. S. officials to get

the picture cleared up. A/l said,

"Let's try to get along

with the Norteamericans, it's better to have them with us

than againat us."

SOMOZA agreed, but said he had sent his

brother, Luis SOMOZA, ahead.

The following day, 19 Aug, General SOMOZA:

called A/l and said Luis had called him, reporting he had

talked to Vaughn in Miant. Said Vaughn had denied talking to

Bydney ROSS or of passing such infcruation to the Ambassador

In Panama®

Luis said he dropped the subject at that point and

talked

about other things.

(A/1 believes Luis could be

fabricating as usual or could have botched up the interview if

It did take place.)

A/1 again strongly recommended that General

SOMOZA make his own visit to washington and talk to Vaughn and

others in person.

On 19 Argust, A/1 Interviewed President SCHICK

for: the Tridente

(MRR news magazine).

He had previously

Interviewed General SOMOZA.. The interview reports will be

rolatively innocuous coverage of some of the major events of

the day.

The agenda of points for each interview is attached.

N/1 Intends to dedicate an issue of Tridente to each country

which has helped the MRR, e-6. Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama,

Venezuela, and Colombia.

FROM

:ANBIDDY/1

SUBJECT: VIdal ESPINAL. Ferrero, possible CI suspect

1.

Subject is a Spaniard who is believed to i

working now at the Ron Carta Vieja factory In Panam City.

He previously lived in Managua and worked for Colonel

Miguel RUIZ Herrera (« Costa Rican sometimes employed by

General Anastasio SOMOZA) as a specialist in guerrilla

warfare.

2. About late May or early June, ESPINAL was

drinking in a Managua bar and angaged one of A/1's dele-

atton in conversation, not knowing who he was.

He claimed

to have been in Guatemala recently where he had worked with

some "gooú people 'of the lower classes" in an attemot to

overthrow the Guatemalan government.

He quoted at length,

and accurately, from Che. GUEVARA and used examples, also

necuately, for some Fidel CASTRO operations on how to

overthrow a government.

A/l's man played the part of a

leftirt sympathizer to elicit from subject.

Through the

Nicaruguan security service, the MR people found out

that Col. RUIZ H. claimed subject had come to him and

presented himself as a GY expert saying he was willing to

work for him in an attempt to make a coup against the govern

ment in Costa Rica.

In early July, subject told Col. RUIZ H.

that the Costa Rican operation was

taking too long and nothing

much was going on, so he was going to Paname from where he

could be called back immediately when they were ready to go in

Costa Rica. Subject had also been overheard to say in Managua

that he had a special mission to assassinate a Central American

president

A/1 said the Nicaraguan service bolleven that

MKNORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM : AMBIDDY/ 1

SUBJECT:

AMBIDDY/1 discussion with President ORLICH,

Foreign Minister ODUBER and other Costa Bican

officials, late July to mid-August 1965.

1.

In late July, A/1 went to Costa Rica and met with

President ORLICH, telling him the MRR was out of business so far

as operations directly against Cuba are concerned,

and no longer

needs bases, money,

or other support for such paramilitary

activities.

A/i described the

Latest MRR program to. combat

CASIRO/Communist efforts in Latin America by engaging in

community development and counter-insurgency activities.

He

asked only for help in projecting a progressive and constructive

Image and some basic prestige for the MRR and for himself.

To

that end, he reminded President ORLICH that both of. them knew

full well that in the whiskey snuggling scandals and coup

$tempts for which A/l had taken the rap, not only was he not

guilty, but had been,

in fact, the first

one to give the warning

in both cases•

In return for

those past lavors, he now want

Pres. ORLICH to put him together with Daniel ODUBER (the PLN

candidate for president who will almost certainly be elected)

In order to counteract the bad-mouth put on A/? to ODUlY

"Yo-yo" QUIRO%.

proposed to meet ODUBER personally,

Manolo RAY, Colonel FIGUS, ond. Teard let him make up his

own mind. Pres.. ORLICH called ODUBER's office,

but he was off

politicking on the coast.

ORLICH then sent A/1 with Colonel

LIPPA (a good friend of A/1) to talk with ODUBER's secretary,

who also is a good friend of Col. LIPPA®

The secretary (actually

& male assistant) said everybody talks about A/1 but nobody really

knows him or very much about him. Some good liberal revolutiona

ries say he 19 a good man, othem say he is a s. O. B.

A/1

replied that was the reason he had taken the treuble

to come to

Bee CDUBERg

that he would make his position clear himself and

would so giad to confront any eccusers if CUBER so desired.

The secretary said they were concerned about the campagn

becawe

the oppostion

was uniting and was getting plenty of

money from big

businessmen

Mant.

He also offered to help Pres. ORLICH's secretary,

Roberto MADRIZ, Who may run for Deputy if he can be

convinced to ignore his shyness and reluctance to make

political speeches.

On. 8 and 9 August, A/1 was again in Costa Rica

and net with ODUBER, this meeting was arranged by oberto

MADRIZ•

ODUBER admitted that he knew the Cubans were not

sulty of the smuggling charges that had been levied against

them.

He also appreciated A/l's previous refusals to assist

coup plotters and his help in squelching thei? efforts. A/1

maid ho told ODUBER,

"I know you have been told I am a s. O. B.

and I want you to see for yourself what I am and take up your

mind.

I know the people who have so described me and would

like to meet you together with them so you can make your own

Judgement."

M/1 said these opening remarks brought on

ODUBER'& replies about the smuggling and coup reports.

W/l sald he gave ODUBER a quick history of the

RR, what it has done,

and what it stands

for.

He tuld

DUBIR he renlized they had not been close before, but he

felt CDUBER and the PLN were the best choice for Costa Rica

and therefore the MRR WaS

prepared to support him in any way

they can, Including tratning, men and equipment.

ODUBER

«whod for a specialist to do some training of his personal

eur ty group, and to furnish some walkie-talkie radios. for

them 1f possible.

A/1. assigned Luis ARRIZURIETA Sardinas.

(301-398890), a member of the MER. delegation to Costa Rica,

who Is well-known and trusted by ODUBER,

to full-tine duty as

A/1 also offered to donate .

ODUBER also took A/l up on hia previous offer to

print posters, etc.

A/1 told him that the MiR people had heard

0f & Communiet plot ic -rap ODUBER by waiting to the strategie

moment and making a wiely publicised declararion that they

•re supportint him completely..

This would split the FLN and might

one the election for ChigER, thus putting in a weak or reactio

ry Sroup whom the Communists could

ODUBER wald he would expose this scheme and get the jump on them

by maying he doenn't want or need anything fron the Communists,

If he does take over, there will

be many problems for the

The Station continues to receive numerius reports on

Most are fragmentary and based on stories

which someone has heard about town but invariably cannot be

traced to exact sources. Some of these reports are an follows:

ANRAZZ/1.

The departure of AMBIDDY/1 and his

from the WAVE area was dur to pressure from ODACID.

This action was the result of the publicity generated by

ANWORLD After their successtul operation.

The departure

did not signify a loss of aid to AMORLD from ODYOKE.

•*it of AMYUM/19 from AMWORLD was due to his dissatisfaction

With AXBIDDY/1's immoralities.

It is supposed that ALYUN/19

1m a spokesman in this regard for the AGRUPACION CATOLICA.

AMBIDDY/1 1s accused of leading & licentious life for some

time; having a mistress who was formerly a mistressa.of

Batista; and buying & house and presenting it to this woman.

It is also reported

that he will marry this woman soon.

AMRAZZ1.

Carlos MONTANER advised that AMBIDDY/1

has almost run out of funds and that his group will soon be

1.

At 1600 kurs, 21 November 1984, I complied with

ABIDDY-l's request relayed through the Security Office

that he be called on FRinklin 3-1568 in Miamd.

ABIDDY-I described reports reaching him of

mysterious phone calla being received by various Cubans

in Miant, mostly MRA personnel or wives of MiR members.

These calla started during the morning of "1 November.

The caller was & North American who spoke Spanish and gave

Ain name as "Bill Jones."

The caller sought in each case

to molicit derogatory information about AMBIDDY-], with

particular emphasis on A-l's alleged participation in

mggling activities.

The caller offered money (A-1 did

not know how much) for derogatory information.

A-l mentioned two persons who received calls:

ANYUN-19 and the wife of Manolin Hernandez.

In addition

to smuggling, A-19 was also asked if the reason he broke

with A-1 was because of the marriages of AMJAVA-4 Or A-1.

A-19 denied these allegations to the caller.

A-I maid that the story spreading through Hiant

an a result of these calls is that the U.S. Government

and probably CIA specifically - was attempting to discredit

A1 as a basis for denouncing him.

A-1 was obviously

distressed by these speculations,

and. in reporting them

ho was in roality noking th question. I gave him

• my

anequivocal assurance that the U.S. Government was

not

respontibir for tie calla..

I anked A-l who he thought was responaible and

ho said "maybe the Miami Herald."

A-I said that he had

nd that Burt was angry because he felt that the recent

TY coverage of the ANORLD campa and activities in Central

America was a scoop to which he uns rightfully entitled

because of a prior agreement with AbIdDY.

A-1 gave

Burt his side of the stories being circulated about

AMORLD's contraband activities.

Al felt that he

made an impression. Burt was particularly interested

in a dental of these charges which A-l told Burt would

be issued vory soon by the President of Costa Rica (see

following paragraph). Al said he thought that he may.

have nollifled Burt somewhat by having the meeting and

by promising him scoops in the future, but that Burt

still holds a grudge against him.

AMBIDDY-1 said he was expecting momentarily

Hopefully,

Hernandor' call would be to rend a public letter from

President Orlich officially denying the presence of

MWORLD training camps in Costa Rica and disavowing

charges that A-l or his people were involved in smuggling.

Orlich promised A.. to issue such & letter.
