Case officer acknowledgua taat we recognized his po:
for harmful action, had considered it thoroughly, ai
hoped be would not do anything of the kind ARTIME said -
fe had also considered all the possibiliti: ad concluded .
there was mo point in his being childish and trying to ao ft Y
“bite us about the ankles.” : :

3. ARTIME accepts. the decision and will cooperate
fm a phase-out program. He does oot understand the
vationale, and, of course, does not agi.@ with the
@ecision, but be acknowledges our prerogative to make it,
3g we really wieh still to be friends, he is willing,
just as he told Mr. FitzGerald originally, He esks only : : .

makes two requests from us: (a) help take care of bie men
ané their families until they can rehabi.itate and
resettle theaselves, and (b) do everything possible to
get bis parents out of Cuba.

4. The major elesents to be considered in a phase~
eut vere discussed with the following results:

a. Personnel. The first priority is support

nts to dependents which were due 1 March in.
the total amount of $100,00. This must be cone
@oonest if ARTIME is to maintain control of the
g@ituation. The next. most immediate problem is
ve-entry permission for fifteen of his men who have —
been atranded in Nicaragua trying to return to the:
Waited States since Decexber. -Theae sen were ex~
@Altrated "biack" from the United States with our
assistance and require special authority for
re-entry from Department of State and Department of

- dustice, which we. thought was arranged in early

The demobilization plan proposed by. ARTINE
secucd ag realistic and effective as could be hoped
for, Ez proposes to return the bulk of bis mea,
imately 200, to the United States during March
gnu, give them one month's pay on 1 April as a mustering
out payuent to support them and their families while

geek other employment. The balance of his men,
Yeas than 100, will bs heid in Central America for
one month longer ag a security oad advinistrative
force muster the group’s equipsent at Monkey Point
from whioh disposition can be aace during the month

E


“3-

of april. The security force will be returned
during April and vill be paid a sustering out pay~
pent on ] May. This will terminate the project.

The cover story which ARTINE intends to use
for Gemobilizstion is to inform his men that their
gothership is out of commission and. vill require about .
ix weoxs for repairs. This is true enough so that .
4@ will be believed. He will then grant
wen with dependents to get their personal
order before operations commence again. He will .
publicize the fact that it 1 pensive and : 7
better for morale to send them on leave than to have
men sitting around the camps with no operations to | .
yun. When all the first contingent are back home,
fndividual notice will be given each to start looking
for other work as operations have been postponed.
They will be told that the salary payment of 1 April
will be the last one and should be considered as a
sustering out bonus. ARTIME. Zeele this: method will

ieee eot the impact and lower the noise level as the
a men will be home with their families and scattered
throughout the community instead of being in an

‘zed group in Central america when they realize
they are being dexobilized. na

tb. Vunds. ARTIME had done his homework and
brought with him facts and figures upon which phase-
eat costs could be estimated, These cost estinates
are outlined below:

1 March - $100,000.. Dependents support and
salaries

i ce. Weapors. ARTINE agreed that it would be in

i gobody’s interest for his weapons to fall into the wrong
i bands. He was asked for ideas on dis,
i

ares and came up with the following su;
appears to be on excellent one. The mothership, MV
GANTA MARIA, 19 in need of repairs and aust go into a
ebipyard,,. Tentative arrangements have been made to

put her in the yards at Galveston, Tex: some time

fm Maroh or April, ARTINK can order his security detail
to store the arus aboard the ship for "secirit,;"” reasons
before she leaves for the yard. They will simply re-
ain on board when the ship leaves and we can take
eontrol cf the ship and the weapons from that point on.

6, Maritine,
(1) MV SANTA MARIA. See above. The ship

would be sailed from Monkey Point with a contract
erew supplied by

Qne of ARTIME's senior officers would accompany |
the ship as his representative, with orders to.
@ura over control of it and the arms upon its
arrival at Galveston. CIA officers, possibly
would accept -
@ustody and Office of Logistics could recover the
weapons and any other equipment which might be
hipped by this wethod. The ship would then be
@isposed of according to _Heedquarters wishes at

However, one sonth’s
‘er payment of $1,250 was due 1 March, and

snother will be due by the time the aircraft can
be returned. ARTIME was reluctant to let the plane
go back without payment, but aleo reluctant to ;
@queeze the $2,500 out of his budget. Case officer
» Woiced bis opinion that the owner would probably
be glad to get the plane back and would not likely
think it worth going to court. However, in view
of the fact that it would be a "closed-circuit"
transaction and would actually cost the Government
Cates Sothing, it is recommended that a special euthoriza-
ee tion of $2,500 be channeled to ARTIUE for payment
: fa order to maintain ARTIME's reputation for fiscal
in HE probity. He will surely appreciate this gesture,

as (8) 1-20 Beaver and Cossna-180. These :
»; @averagt technically belong to ARTINE's group and
recovery would be a sticky matter, legally.
ARTINES hopes to hold control of these aircraft
for the time being, and it is recommended that
We go along with him, saving disposition arrange-
weats until later,

5. ARTIME again euphasized at the close of the meeting
@hat be must have soonest the March payments for families

1, Manuel srtime Buesa, a non-practicing medical
@sotor, began his political activities in Cuba during the
year 1989 whon he participated in the formation of a civic .
action type program knows. as the “Comandos Rarale: The ”
Comandos Burales actively participated with the

FO.
vegies during its initial agrarian reform, but eventually...
broke with it due to Castro’s shift to Harxism-Leninisa.
It wae at this point that Artins formed the Movimiento de
Becuperacicn Revolucionaria (sa8, Sovensnat for the Recovery
ef the Revolution), a political organization which he beads
wp te date. The degree of Artine'’s activities in the civic
eetion program was reflected by the fact that Artizs, prior ~
to his break with Castro, had been appointed a cepiity in
the Instituto Eacicual de la Befcrsa Agregaria (IUBA) for

maintain contact with Artime and render support to him on a

: modest basis. His monthly operating budget, which he sub-

rf suet mitted to us, would enable him to keep the MRR alive as a
recognized exile political organization, and would allow him,
personally, to maintain his status as an important exile paisa
leader, This would, in turn, continue his access to heads of

state and other leading political figures in Latin America.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

__SUBJECT: Contact of Manuel Artine with Professor, George

Lodge and with Col, Barrientos of Bolivia

1, I talked with Manuel Artime by phone the night
of 4 June: He said he had received a call from Professor
Lodge that afternoon but was not at home to talk with bia,
(This was obviously a follow-up from tle offer made tu
Artime by Chief, WH to put him and Lodge together on his
proposed civic action activities.) I told him there
BO reason he should not return the call and arrange for a
-meeting with Lodge at their mutual convenience,

3. Artime said that wes his firs: reaction, but
before he could make the call another message had come in

” @xom Col. Barrientos of Bolivia asking if he could visit

the country for the benefit of his advice and counsel and

” offering to send a Bolivian Air Force plane to pick him up

and bring him to La Paz. I asked if he were acquainted
with Barrientos or an expert on Bolivia and he said he ‘vew
mo more about either of them than what he had read in tue
papers. He had no jdea of the reason for the invitation,
but wanted to check with us and find out if we had any

¥ told him I would check with Chief, WH next morning and
+ @all him back. ft

3. On the morning of 5 June I called Artime. He said

him he was interested in getting together with him, Lodge
gaid ke would be in Panama on 14 June, and Artime said he
planned to be
easily meet him there. <Artime told Lodge he was willing to

be more useful, Lodge seemed delighted and invited Artime

requirements for him in cass we wanted him to make the visit.

Professor Lodge had called him at 0700 that morning and told

wavelling iz that area at that time and could

make a trip to Poston to see him earlier and that after such
a preliminary meeting, the next meeting in Panama would probably

ie SECRET
-2-

to lunch with him on 9 June, I suggested to Artime that

he plan to meet Lodge on 9 June, stop in Sashington on the
way home where I could meet with him (and furnish him a
briefing on Bolivia which he desperately requested). I
suggested he send a message to Barrieatos saying he could
be in Panama on 1] June and could see Barrientos as soon
thereafter as transportation could be arranged. (Artime has
&@ visit with President Robles of Panama scheduled about that
time and can work it in, together with the meeting with

4. Artime said he had found out the background of the
dnvitation from Barrientos. One of Barrientos’ trusted
aides had been to Washington or New York and in passing
through Mitmi enroute home heard a MRR radio broadcast
about countering subversion, civic action, etc, that
attracted his attention, There was also a brief analysis
of the situation in Bolivia which appealed to him as the
best-balanced hehad heard, He. thereupon started asking
questions about the MRR and Artime and referred to one”
of Artime's people who turned over some copies of "Tridente"
(magazine of the MRR), ‘The aide remarked that he was going
to report to Barrientos of his discovery of a Cuban exile
group that seomed knowledgeable of Castro and Communist
subversion operations and had some useful ideas of howto
counter them, Two days later Artime- received the invitation

from Barrientos. |

reported inforsation he had received from Iden A, as follows:.

a; Iden B said that AMBIDDY-1 was only concerned
with maintaining the small AMWORLD camp in Nicaragua, where
there were weapons, ammunition, and seven men, who were there
without the knowledge of the ODYOKERs. Iden B said. that
AMBIDDY-1 was awaiting an opportune moment to arm as many
friends as possible and leave for PBRUMEN,

i b. Iden C said that there really were arms and

wen there spent all their time looking for persons to buy
the arms and ammunition, -

’

‘ ¢, Iden C also said he believed that if AMBIDDY-1 was
keeping up his radio transminaions and payments to some
Journalists it was because they rved as a cover for his
commercial operations and that all the propaganda would
@isappear when AMBIPDY-1 had to -use AMWORLD money to keep up:

Meetings with AMJAVA-4 in Washington, 27-28 June 1965
Subject: Proposed Agency Programs : if

1, Following the demise of AMWORLD, AMJAVA-4 has becone
familiar with three other Agency programs, or proposed prograas,
and he asked if he could have some clarification as to just
what we wanted from him and his people. 1 explained that there were
three different functions which needed to be done and that the
Agency was trying to develop programs to meet each need. The
three functions concerning Cuba are:

(a) to maintain the MRR as a. respected resi:
organization with a political posture which acceptable to most
Cubans and not inimical to U.S, interests, are asking approval of

- @ minimum budget for subsidy of the MRR which will pay for its
pubiished and radio publicity matter, subsistence to survivors of
MRR killed, disabled, or captured, and travel expenses for. AMBIDDY-1.
as the der of the ticvement outside Cuba. We are trying to
guide A-1 into a program of Community Development/Civic Action
Projects in Latin America as a means of projecting an image of the
MRR and of A-1 as constructive, forward-looking people instead of
Simply exile counterrevolutionaries. We would hope that such
activities would keep the movement together, give the members
practical experience which would eventually be useful in Cuba, and
an the moantine, would render useful results in countering
problems of insurgency in Latin America,

‘tance.

*(>) to prepare a managerial and executive team of
specially selected Cuban exiles who would be ready to move into Cuba.
should relations be resumed with the United States in order to eet
furnich effective direction of necessary governmental functions and
- Qssist the United States in denying the island to Communist
control. Selected candidates would, hopefully, be fairly young
@s well as intelligent and capable of profiting from extensive
training programs which would be designed for cach to prepare hin
to perform a specific function in a future Cuban regime. . The
program would be apolitical, each person being considered as an
~ individual and not as representative of any organization. This
ag the program for which A-4 is being considered for training in
the field of internal security for work with the Agency in’a post=- 9

situations anywhere in the world on short notice and for shore
periods of time. When not mobilized, the Agency would asnj<q
them inmaintaining employment and supporting themselves. tmey
would also, of course, be available for emergency operatioins,) -
commitment to Cuba if required. (it was explained that this was
the program handled by Mr, Tom Clines of SOD, who was present and
@iscussed it more in detail with A-4.)

H

i
2, A-4 understood that the programs outlined above way i
only parts of an overall concept concering Cuba, that the yirse was 5
designed to meet long-term political considerations, the second i
@ meet long-term strategic requirements, and the third to meet HEE
current operational needs, He understood and completely aireed : f
with each program, and agreed to cooperate in executing oan of ‘
them, to the maximum of his ability. He will be happy to sot and
recruit for us in each pregram, and will try to influence, AyBIDDY-1
a@song the lines we want him to follow, A-4 appreciated ou,
explanations and stated it he could be much more helpfuh to us
now that he understoud what we were trying to accomplish.

<EMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with George Lodge, Harvard School
of Business

“-) 1. On 15 July 1965, with of CA Stuff,
I met Mr, Lodge at the Key Bridge Warriott Hotel to discuss
what he knew about the relations among AMBIDDY-1, Bishop
McGrath of Panama, and.a rural development program they: are.
all working on.in Panama. Mr. Lodge described Bishop McGrath
@ real ball of fire, about 39 or 40 years old, born of
8. parents in the Canal. Zone but he has taken Panama’ —-
citzenship, He graduated from Notre Dame University, did
Graduate work in Rome and has taught in several European
and Latin American universities, such as in Chile. - He is
one of the three top Catholic prelates in Latin: America
and has extremely close ties with the Vatican, e.g., he is
om the Ecumenical Couneil and on the birth control group. He
has an official operating budget of $2,000 per year which he
augments from every conceivable source, Particularly from ‘the
_ German bishops, He is politically and operationally minded,
an American completely in his attitude and behavior, a
~ typical Irish: politician, Mr.- Lodge submitted somewhat
wryly. His parents are retired and live in Uiami where he
visits often. . He recently met AMBIDDY-1 there on two occasions,
| Oa this same visit he also met the Papal Nuncio from Santo
_ Domingo (he appears to receive most of the hot potatoe type
» assignments in his part.of the world).

: a, Veraguas Province of Panama is a selected testing
ground for community develosment programs if rural areas.
Tt 48 the poorest and most hopeless province of Panama, a
small armed uprising took place there in 1958 and wae put
dorn, The Communista have their best organization in Panama
‘<2 thie province, The program there is based on the. village.
‘of Ban Francisco, about 10 miles off the highway, and ie an
expansion of the efforts of the parish priest Father VASQUEZ

-2-

Pinto who has been thereabout 10 years, He is a dynamic
young man: who has. lead the villagers to rebuild their village
and church to develop their land and organize a cooperative
and small credit facilities. The village is only 1,200
people but they raised by themselves $1,000 to buy materials
and then built a training center capable of housing, feeding
and training 60-men at a time in rural cooperatives and rural
development. One of their ideas is to select bright looking
leaders and potential leaders from rural areas, first in
Panama and later, hopefully, from other nearby countries

for visits of a few days in which they hope to brain-wash
them of Communist type propaganda they may have heard and
ghow them what. can actually be done so they can take the
good word with them to their own communities. This is in
addition to the regular formal course. of 4 months for
selected young potential leaders from rural communities in
Panama and all over Latin America.

3. Another leading light in the program is Father
Steele who was thrown out of Dominica by Trujillo for
organizing cooperatives and is a recognized authority on
the subject. Father Steele uses Veraguas as a home base
but travels to Chile, Colombia and other countries conducting

A. AMBIDDY~1 has a warehouse in the WAVE area in
which he is storing equipment brought back from his Central

collected by the AMLYLACs - tend to affect th: latters' morale
and confidence in KUBARK because the AMLILACs believe that
anything AMBIDDY-1 does is done with KUBARK support and blessing.
As Headquarters is aware the great fear of the AMLILACS is that
AMBIDDY-1 will get all the action and all the glory. However,
in view of the current KUBARK/AMBIDL;-1 relationship the
AMLILACs have little to fear and a renewed morale crisis is not
expected to arise. On the other hand, if AMBIDDi-1 were to
re-activate part of his action force and conduct a raid utilizing
ae non-KUBARK support, that would be another matter. It would then
ee be very difficult to convince the AMLILACs that KUBARK was not

., .dnvolved and their morale and confidence would be badly shaken,
This situation is brought to your attention simply to show what
~ effect such AMBIDDY-1 activities would have on this Station's
painstaking efforts to retain a superior and >xperienced commando
capability under already difficult psychological conditions. i

REF: UFGA 22667, 10 August 1965

1. As you know, the HQS AMWORLD case officer recently visited
the WAVE area and went to the warehouse vith AWJAVA-4@ and his wife,
described as a possible purchaser of some of the equipment. The
warehouse is full of moldy and rusting carp ‘and support: equipme st,
most of it of no use in mounting raiding operations. There. are.
outboard motors, small generators, engine spare parts, air drop
equipment, bedding, etc, in addition to a large pea of baby chicks
purchased by AMBIDDY-1 in bis latest venture of training for rural
civic development programs in Central America. There was O00 -
custodian working around the warehouse and taking care of the
chickens, AMBIDDY-) has. also purchased an off-set printing press,
for $10,000 according to his, which is set up a few blocks away.
Be plans to use it to print the AMYUM magazine, plus hopefully
making some profit for AMYUM from it on commercial printing jobs.

2, AMJAVA-4 and AMBIDDY-1 both laughed heartily at the idea
that the PC of BABUN could be converted to 8 mothership,. This
was considered and rejected several months ago when AMWORLD was
still authorized to operate. They turned down the. offer of the
ship aa a gizt thon on greasds that it would be uneconomical even
42 given to them free of charge. é

3. AMBIDDY-1 said he did have a total of ten mop itn Ricaragua;, |

local Izdians to read, write and grow rice;' three non at. Blzefields

4. ANBIDDY-1 was advised by his case officer in atrongest
terms to sell or throw avay *ver,thing from the Central American
canps, to concentrate on trying to project a pew image of hinself
a8 & constructive and progressive leader involved in Community
development and civie action type programs in Latin America by
invitation of the local governments, and to stop talking or acting

to got out of the DAVE area-as soon as poasible to remove hiasetf
as a target of constant personal attacks against which he could -
Bot defend binself. He agreed in principle, subject to waiting
three sonths for his wife to celiver their. first child, i

5, WAVE may agsure the ANLILAC leader that, to the best
knowledge of KUBARK, the AMWORLD program ia dead, that. AMBIDDY-1
bas no real intention and only limite? capability of sounting
raids, and that anything he. might do aiong the lines of paramilitary
action would certainly be without ODYOKE support or blessing givea
the present political climate in aQ8 area.

6. FYI, BQ8 continues to try to influence AMBIDDY-1 to s:
out of paramilitary matters entirely, To this end, we shall try”
to keep his top operational personnel otherwise occupied in KUBARK
er other employment, to keep him as fully and ugefully occupied as
possible away from the WAVE and PBRUMEN area, and to convince his
to sell or lease his two Swift koats to commercial enterprises
er to another KUBARK program outside the WAVE area. . :

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM  : AMBIDDY/1 - 23 Aug.st 1965
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY/1 discussions with General Anastasio

1. A/1 first met with General SOMOZA 27/28 July.
The following points were made in these discussions:

a. General SOMOZA said the State Department is
making an investigation of how much money he is using to control
the government and win the next presidential elections. SOMOZA
told A/l that he intended to run and fully expected to win the
election, but would not need to buy any votes. He asked A/1 to
please tell "Washington" that State is very clumsy and if they
really want to know anything they should call on the Agency, or
the FBI, either of which is much more effective. SOMOZA said
everybody in. Managua knows about State's efforts to block his.
“eandidacy and are laughing at them.

ee b. SOMOZA suid he was meeting Daniel ODUBER of

. Costa Rica at the border shortly, and they would make a "non-
aggression pact" agreeing that neither will make trouble. for.
the other's caupaign for election to Presidency. ODUBER had
asked for the interview. SOMOZA told A/1 that he thought .
QDUBEX had made a "live and let live" agreement with the Com-
munists, and that at their meeting, he would demand from ODUBER
&@ public denunciation of the Communists to be followed by
efi.ctive control measures.against them.

o. The MRR will be allowed to build and operate
@ stall boatyard for construction, maintenance and repair of
: jghrimp boats at Bluefields without SOMOZA or the Nicaraguan
4 Government to. be cut into. the proceeds. This is part of A/1's
. Community development progrsm, aimed at developing a large
Sor“. @4ehing cooperative. based ca Bluefields which will be self-
ie sustaining and profitable for the members and the local economy.
: SOM“OZA also approved continuation of the basic education
‘ogram being conducted by A/i’s five, man contingent at the old
lonkey Point base and oventual déVelepment of that armas a rice-
growing cooperative for the benefzit of the local Indians.

With BOMOZA and (fnu) BENITEZ, a Puerto Rican, former politician

Be

d. General SOMOZA, at A/l's strong recommendation,

“ agreed to start pushing Civic Action programs through the National

Guard in an effort to enhancc his personal image preparatory to

the next Presidential campaign. SOMOZA asked 4/1 to assist and
advise in this effort.

2. The next meeting with General SONOZA by A/1 was
on 4 August, with following points:

&@. SOMOZA said that the latest program of Fidel
CASTRO is targetted against Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama,
Pat: of the plan includes assassination of the presidents of
the three countries as part of a terror campaign to soften
them up. He said that in Panama, Particularly, President
Marcos ROBLES is a prime target but the Communists are exploiting .
® recent turn against him by the. National Guard because he has
cut down on their costs, pensions, and other privileges, If
ROBLES is eliminated from power, the Communists feel the chief
of tha National Guard will take over and they thinkémg they.
can handle him more easily than they can ROBLES. i

bs Source for above, according to SOMOZA, was a
close associate of Marcial AGUILUZ, whom he described as the top
Communist in Costa Rica and one who had recruited (fnu) FONSECA,
@ Nicaraguan now living in Mexico. FONSECA is a bastard son of
one of SOMOZA's foremen, a Communist, ar? an agent working
@irectly under order of Fidel CASTRO.

: @. A/1 and SOMOZA talked again about a Civic
Action program in Nicaragua and SOMOZA said again that he would
support it. He will assign Father LUGO, a Cuban priest who
gerved with the Bay of Pigs’ forces, to a position similar to a
Chaplain in the National Guard in order to assist in the program.
SOMOZA will support MRR community development programs with
whatever authorizations are required and with whatever official
or personal preatige he may offer.

3. A/1 next returned to Managua on 17 August and mot
with Major PEREZ of the Nicaraguan Customs Service, a personal aide
to the Generat, PEREZ said SOHOZA was very angry (not at A/1 or

a8 Fecale) and difficult to see. He said 3 Colonels were under
avrest for 3 days each for disobeying orders. PEREZ was afraid
to mee SOMOZA for fear he might be arrested also, However, A/1
Gailod SONCZA by phone and was invited to visit him next day
at Tipitapa, A/l met him the next day (18 Aug) -and had lunch

and A/l went with SOMOZA in his car. While they were riding
SOM“OZA told A/) why he was 60 angry. 5 :

d. & message had recently come to General
SONOZA from the Nicaraguan Ambassador in Panama saying that he
had it from authoritative sources thal. the U.S. not only
would not support his candidacy for the Presidency, but would
strongiy oppose it. In addition, SOMOZA had word that Sydney
ROSS, Director of El Tiempo (Spanish language newspaper in
New York), after a recent Interview with Asst. Secretary Jack
Vaughn of the State Department, had an off-the-record tal
with VAUGHN after the interview. VAUGHN had said that, so far
as he was concerned, SOMOZA was no different from the other
Latin American dictators such as TRUJILLO, PERON, DUVALIER,
STROESSNER, Col. LOPEZ, or Gen. CASTELL Branco, and that he
could certainly not support installing another military dictator
im Nicaragua. The two reports were confirmatory in SOMOZA
“mind and made him feel extremely bad as he said he has always
talked favorably about the U.S. and tried to cooperate with them
at every chance.

. « SOMOZA checked with the U.S. Ambassador in
Wicaragua (whether in person or by sending Pres. SCHICK was

not made clear) about the matter, and received a typical State
Department reply that the U.S. was neutral in Nicaraguan internal
affairs and would take no action about the elections. . The
Ambassador said he could not ‘believe. VAUGHN could have made

such statements because of the U.S. position of neutrality in

Bicaraguan affoirs.

ff. SOMOZA also said he had sent a message to
Washington suggesting that if some of the other countries heard

about themselves being lumped with TRUJILLO, PERON, etc. they
might well call back their troops from Santo Domingo and tell
Washington to go to hell.

Hi g- He said he was going aberc with his plans
regardless of what the U.S. does about it and reminded A/1 of
Mr. J. C. KING's talk with him (SONOZA) at the airport in
Washington to iet him know after the wistiusa attack on the
SIERRA ‘U that Washington would undersiand if SOMOZA
decided to kick A/1 and his camps out of Nicaragua. He used

_(s this as an example of an attempt from Washington to dictate

to him which he had ignored, telling A/1 that he was a friend,
would continue. to be, and would continue to make his own
decisions regardless of what Washington might want from him.

o A/1 made another strong suggestion that SOMOZA take off his
~  Qndgorm and start making public. his civic action ideas. In

addition, he again advised him to go peracually to Washington

sONE



to talx directly with VAUGHN and other U. 8. officials to get
the picture cleared up, 4/1 said, “Let's try to get along
with the Norteamericans, it's better to have them with us
than against us." SOMOZA agreed, but said he had sent his
brother, Luis SoMOzA, ahead,

h. The following day, 19 Aug, General SOu0zA.
ealled A/1 and said Luis had called him, reporting he had

talked to Vaughn in Miami, Said Vaughn had denied talking to

Sydney ROSS or of Passing euch infcrmation to the Ambassador

in Panama. Luis said he dropped the subject at that point and ‘i
talked about other things. (A/1 believes iuis could be

fabricating as usual or could have botched up the interview aft
it did take place.) 4/1 again strongly recommended that Generali

SOHOZA make his own visit to Washington and talk to Vaughn and
others in person.

* 4. On 19 Avgust, A/1 interviewed President SCHICK
for the Tridente (MRR news magazine). He had previously

interviewed General SOMOZA.. The interview reports will be

to stress or suffering misfortuse, some of the obverse traits
begin to show: Uncoatrollable wutbursts of fury, inpulsive
reactions, peeriss vingictivesess and self-pity (nose of
which have observed by us firsthand). i

6. Imbued with a somevnat shallow philosophy, AMBIDDT-1.
fig prone to tailor ideas to wnat he strives to accomplish at
any gives moment and to the impreseion he desires to leave with
Bis opposites. Since he rightly views his relationship with
tae smericans as crucial toward the achievement of main goal,
vis., to overthrow and succeed Castro, his pronounciapentos
usually hew close to what he conceives to represent the mia
James of american thought.

9. AMBIDDY-1's personality feeds cn adulation and sur-
face manifestations of loyalty, despite the fact that he
Glains to view loyalty te his persos as epheneral and as
ader continuing threat of subversica, especially by hie
Anericad allies. To the exteat possible, we have attenpted

and views cven his closest associates as mere pawns whose

A@MNBIDDY-1 has a remarkable knowledge'cf facts which in any
G@iscussion he ably warshals and articulates.

10. AMBIDOY-1°'s views of things American is. conditioned

his quest for a key position in the struggle to overthrow.
. Hence, any advice is selectively accepted or (usually

tacitly) rejected, depending on whether it serves to otrengthen
St position. There is, of course, nothing reprehensible

33. AMBIDDY-1 relates to hie <avironment in eseontie lly

relinquished control over this affair to am extent ubere: it
mow threatens his life's work. Ia aMBIDDY-1's PRQ I] we
predicted, more boldly than wisely, that he would not get
caught up im female entanglements. While we did not under
rate the power of sex, we probably ov:rrated AMBIDOY-1l's
eharacter and motivation.

far ite intrinsic value as an unconventional warfare

A the possibility that aMBIDDY-1 could be working for the
i other side-—either now or later. We view this possibility
| as most unlikely, yet feel sonewhat remise in not having

paid much attention to what transpired between the landing
at Plays Giron and the Rose Bowl ceremony. There has been
@ome talk about his having undergone marked personality
ehenges during that period in his life, but we actually de
ast know whether and, if so, to what extent hispsyche

Seases intense filial devotion toward his mother. Thus,
Gastro has im hie pover two valuable hostages. We havehad

any concrete reason for believing that such
presmiree would be ef much avail.

16, AMBIDDT-1's intense love of country strikes ne

ee unfeigned. In the light of his resistance record and
feats of perwonnl snorifice, we dovbt rhether he could

to fathom the bedrock of his political coavictieas. I sa

i Weluctant to accept his writings and the program of the HER

Spalysis, it may turm ont that what animates AMBIDOY-2 ia his

unvavering Opposition to Castro is the fact that as long an

Castro is “in” AMBIDOY-1 is likely to remctia “oat.~ That,

for purposes of justifying our suppert to him, may suffice.

DATE =: 15 July 1964

A few days ago I was able to read a report on the activities
in large scale of Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa, and the beginning of his
intimate relations with his present mistress,

Of this report I can meition the most: outatandi: sages As

"De, Manuel ARTIME Buesa takes his firat steps in the public
: life as Political Sargent of the ‘Partido del Pueblo Libro' (Party

MARQUEZ Sterling.

later he directed his activities in the fight against General
BATISTA, going in the Sierra Maestra where he was apointed Lieu-
‘; tenant by Major Humberto SORI-MARIN,

He was appointed Lieutenant because of his friendship with
Major SORI-HARIN, because he was catholic, and because of the lack
ef trained persons in the Sierra Macstra. :
“s There are more news on Dr. Manuel ARTi#E Buesa when he
Published the open letter in the newspaper vance" denouncing
after he left Cubs,

. While in Exilo in Maxico.

In answering, the CASTRO Regime accuses him of having stolen
funds from the Cooperative of which he had charge. This was
certified by his friend Major Humberto SORI-MARIN,

: When he arrives in the USA, that ie in Miami, Florida, he is
.& guest of Mr. Ricardo LORIE and Mr. Michael YABOR. i

An argument begins within the MRR, in which there are two
sides, one includes Ricardo LORIZ and Michaei YASOR, and the.

other Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa and Mise Pepita Ricra.

This argument. becomes stronger because of the appointment of
the MRR Delegate to the Democratic Revolutionary Front. 7

“pe: Manuel ARTIME Buesa aspires with all his strength and.
intrigues to this position.

He seeks the help of Mr. “Macko” BAQUER, who is said to
belong to the CIA and who at the same tine supports the FRD (DRF).

He holds a meeting with Mr. SANJENIS in the Cafeteria Dough- :
Nuts, at 8 and 33 Ave., S¥. |

Caho HERMIDA, Laureano BATISTA Falla and Mr, Juaa MESA, who is
gaid to be a CIA representative. It is common understanding that

He also receives the help of the Catholic Front through
Father GONZALE? Posada and Father LLORENTE, who refused it at a

_ Wita al2 this in his hands, he obtains the coatrol of the
military phase and appoints officers of his trust te the commanding
- posts in Guatemala, such as the brothers San Roman, SUEIRAS,
* Bneido OLIVA, Andrew Jr., Manuel VILLATANA and Carol.

After the disaster of the Bay o% Pigs and the return. to Miami,
he continues with his activities, tanking active part in the Orange
Bowl act, where President John F. KENNEDY ia presented with the
 “Zalse" banner of the Brigade 2506.

* BESERSITIZED

‘That banner was never, at any time, in front of the Bay of

Pigs, but came from Guatemala, brought by MORO-MOLINET and which
-bears his signature on one corner.

The Government of the USA was advised that they would make
@ political play with this banner, so it is returned to Fort
Bernact, and is later destroyed by true revolutionaries.

Dr. Manuel ARTIME Buesa has had contact with the BIRCH Society,
group of crazy Nazi who is an infiltree of the Communists.

There are reports that his father has been a communist for

_ years in a department of Las Villas Province.

man is the son of a Navy officer under BATISTA, who comaitted
suicide in La Cabana at the beginning of the Revolution.)

: SOPA Granda was in the company of his close friend Aida PEREZ
Pozo, who in turn was in the company of her "intimate" friends

other, and the great idyl is born. :

AMWORLD Meeting in Hew York, 6 October 1964.
SUBJECT: AMVORID Contingency Plans

1, AMJAVA-4 said that AMBIDDY-1 was very enthusiastic
about the AMEIJEIRAS operation and felt this was the real
bey to success of our program to overthrow the Castro
Fegine. He is prepared to concentrate on this operation
completely fur the immediate future,

8. I asked A-4 if they had done any planning on the
Desie that the AMRIJEIRAS operation might not pan out.
Be asked me directly whether a decision had been made to.
e@eatinue or to cut off support to AMWORLD. I told him
rat a decision had not been made but that my Headquarters
wae very interested in the outcome of the AMRIJEIRAS
eperation on which he was working. He recognized the
importance of this operation and stated that he and 4-1 |
bad conjectured that Zuture support to AMWORLD might be
e@eatingent on auccess or failure of their handling of
that case, I did not confirm or deny this point but told
Bim that the organization would surely be happy if they
were able to handle it with success,

3. &-4 then explained that he and A-1 had spent
eonsiderable time discussing the future of their program
and their prospects vis a vis the Agency. He said
that in their opinion one things would happen;
either the AMEIJEIRAS operation would pay off in which
ease they would be able to continue to operate with Agency
eupport but with a diversion of major objectives or the
Operation would peter out, in which case they would have
te consider what to do without Agency support. He said
that A-1 was not only prepared to accept a diversion of
primary objective but felt that pregent circumstances:
Gictated the wisdom of such a me, However, both of
thea feel that their present paramilitary program must
be continued, not because it ia crucial to the outcome
ef the Cuban situation, but because the strength which
they exhibit through these operations is the only attrac-
tion to AMWORLD that has caused the AMEIJEIRAS group to
Gontact then,



2

on 4. Iu case the AMBIJEIRAS operation fails to develop,
an@ the Agency should decide to cut off support to AMWORLD,
&-4 says they will continue to try to operate as long as
they can. He said that instead of 200 people they night
be operating with 20, but they could do something, 50 lon:
as they have the hardware with which to operate they caa
“gell" operations each time, For exasple, he said, they
would go to Cuban exiles, to Venesuela, to American.
businessmen, etc. and would tell them, ‘The October saur-

will dedicate it to you and run it in your name." He
feela this would carry them for a few months provided they
Gam run a few successful operations,

& 4&4 said thet when the support ran out the
hardware was all gone, and there was nothing left with
which to operate, A-1 would take 12 or 15 of his hard
e@ore followers and go into the Escambray in Las Villas
to make one last ditch effort, I asked him if A~1 felt
he would have any chance of a success and A-4 stated that
@hould such a state come to passa, A~l would definitely
@e én with the expectation of being run down eventually
and shot but that he would do this in order to go out in
@ blaze of glory and to continue to serve as a martyr.
: é@@ gaid there was absolutely no doubt in his mind that
., @1 vould follow thie course, that he had a hero compulsion
> and a martyr complex and was completely without fear of death.
>| ée@ again mentioned an idea held by A-1 that he will not live
c past 29 January 1965 (hig birthday) because he ia convinced
a it he is destined to reach the peak moment of hig life |
during his 33rd year (as did Jesus Christ) and does oot
* @mpect to live beyond that time.

6, Y asked A-4 where he, personally, stood in suck &
future undertaking. He said that he was no hero, but he had
@edicated seven years of his life as a schoolboy and young

. Baa to Cuban independence, and hc sould not stop now. He
would not go in deliberately to die as a martyr, but he would
eentinue with his work doing the best he could with whatever
 geans he could come by. He stated, "A-1 ig not such © laade?
* gg Tony VARONA who can separate himself completely from he
le and go out to sell used cars, A-1 cannot oxic? t¢

@ie firot even in a suicidal mission," A-4 stated that

ation will cost $25,000. If you will underwrite it we |

@ lige which. i. routine and without persosal power, He will. .



2 a

he, himself, was of a different aature but that it would be
just as impossible for him te go to a routine type of work
gad leave the work of liberation cf his country. .

7. Y% asked A-4 what AMWORLD would do if they vere
able to commence operations agsin, He said they had two
targets on the north coast toast they would like to hit
when they have another chanc Gae is Puerto Vita, the other
fig Manati. They have target studica on Puerto Vite and have
gust recruited a refugee from Manati who knows the ares
thoroaghly and brought out a large number of photographs -
ef the target with him from Cuba, Unfortunately some of
¢hes were confiscated by U, 8, Customs when he cane through
Miami, but there were still enough remaining to plan an
eperation. He asked if we might be able to help recover the
eonfiscated photos. I told him that if approval to recommence
eperations was given, I was gure we could do go. In the

eee geantine, I was, of <9 » not authorized .o discuss possible
; @ature operations but/interested in what ANWORLD was thinking
@long these lines, 4-4 understood our position with the
@urrent cuspension of operations.

8. A-1 reported he received a call from Nilo Messer
who said that Robreno wished to see AMJAVA-4 to make arrange-
ments for the "summit" meeting. It appeared to A-1 that the
representative of the dissident group in Spain wants to deal
with a higher ranking person than Nilo Messer. Nilo has '
received indications that the representative has already
left Cuba and is somewhere in Europe on a shopping spree.

_ Mr. Santell suggested perhaps it would be best tor AMJAVA-4
‘to arrange the meeting in Paris rather than in Spain. A-1
agreed. AMJAVA-4 will probably leave for Spain on 21 November
after his meeting with Carl. zi

8. A-1 was advised that HQS had. received a report stating
Guayo is in possession of photographs presumed to be on the

the ARANZAZU affair and doubts he has photograrls in his
possession unbeknownst to AMWORLD, however, A-1 will inves-
tigate. We advised A-i 40 had no way of checkicg the veracity
of the report, however, wanted to alert him or tne possibility.
A-1 said Guayo is now in Caracas working for "Bbhemia Libre."

4. A-1 plans to leave for Costa Rica on 19 November.
We informed him that one of the topics which Cornelio Orlich may
discues is the increasing publicity being genorated by the
training of Cuban exiles in that country.

1, AMBIDDY-1 called to say he had just returned from
Costa Rica whers he spoke to President Orlich and his brother.
Tne Orlichs made no mention of expelling: A-1, but, to the
contrary, are willing to continue ta.@upport AMWORLD, The *
only request made by President Orlich was. that the arms barge
be taken out of Costa Rica for fear the Communists would
‘learn of its existence, A-1 said he will comply.

2. The topic of conversation quickly changed to the
newspaper article by Hal.Hendrix which greeted A-i upon his
arrival from Costa Rica about A-1 invalvement in smuggling :
activities in Costa Rica, We informed A-1 that Al Burt had i

' antended to publish a similar story: but was scooped by Hendrix,
We asked A-1 what he thought of the idea of having President
Orlich issue a complete denial as soon as possible of A-l's
Smuggling activities in Costa Rica, A=1 felt a presidential

'A-1 stated he would call President Qriieh the first thing in

Hendrix's story was for A-1 to see Al Burt as soon as possible
and categoricsily deny the story. If need be A~l might want

DATE: 31 November 1964, 1600 hours

3. At 1600 Lours, 21 November 1964, I complied with
AMBIDDY-1's request relayed through the Security Office
that he be called on FRanklin 3-1568 in. Miami.

2. AMBIDDY-1 described reports reaching him of
mysterious phone calls being received by various Cubans
in Miami, mostly MRR personnel or wives of MRR members.
These calls started during the morning of 21 November.

The caller was a North American who spoke Spanish and gave

his name as "Bill Jones."

Tae caller sought in each case

to solicit derogatory information about AMBIDDY-1, with

- particular emphasis on A-1's alleged participation in

@muggling activities. The caller offered money (A-1 did

. Rot know how much) for derogatory information.

. 8. Al muntioned two persons who received calls:
AMYUM-19 and the wife of Manolin Hernandez. In addition
* to smuggling, A-19 was also asked if the reason he broke

with A-1 was because of the marriages of AMJAVA-4 or A-1.
A-19 denied these allegations to the caller,

: 4. A-1 said that the story spreading through Miami

as a result of these calls is that the U.S. Government ~~

and probably CIA specifically -- was attempting to discredit

A-1 as 8 basis for denouncing him. A-1 was obviously:
@istressed by these speculations, and. in reporting them
ke was in reality. asking the question. -! gave him my.
unequivocal assurance that the U.S. Government was not

“; pesponibie for tae calls.

6. I asked A-1 who he thought was responsible and

he said "maybe-ths Miami Herald." A-1 said that he had
een Al Burt earlier in the day (Saturday, 21 November)
and that Burt was angry because he felt that the recent

AMWORLD's contraband activities. A-1 felt that’ he
made an impression. Burt was particularly interested
im a denial of these charges which A-1 told Burt would
be issued very soon by the President of Costa Rica (see
following paragraph). A-1 said he thought that he may.
have mollified Burt somewhat by having the meeting and
by promising him scoops in the future, but that Burt
still holds a grudge against hia.

i 6.  AMBIDDY-1 said he was expecting momentarily

& call from Manolin Hernandez in San Jose. Hopefully,
Hernandez’ call would be to read a public letter from
President Orlich officially denying the presence of _
AMWORLD training camps in Costa Rica and disavowing
eharges that A-1 or his people were involved in smuggling.
GQrlich promised A-1 to issue such a letter. When he gsta_
&@ copy of this letter A-1 intends to hold a press

the record straight about charges that AMWORLD. is. involved
