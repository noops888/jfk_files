2, Details of the meeting

A majority of the items covered during the meeting have been

the subject of previous cables from the field. Iowever, for

greater clarity, a number of these were reviewed with AMNIIP/1 and

additional information and comments obtained.

a. Cuban Government efforts to obtain foreign exchange

lotteries.

and related traffic) who wanted him to act as 4 contact wan with

ficante who is presently living in Miami. According

Santos |
to GB, he had been told py(UNSNAFU/19 ys} that DSE Chief

Pineiro had. okayed the fotjowing operation involving the Cuba
lotteries played illegally in Florida, The Cuban Govérnstent.yas
prepared to give througn(ito three winning nuabers hi Meek for
Trafficante to use is protittag con: the Cuban lottertes playea in
Florida, Trafficante was to pay $50, 000 upon receipt of the numbers
srow(t719 and an additional $50,000 after the win. This woney,
which would have Been a free source ‘of income to the Cuban Government,

ok
would then be either banked in Europe by(UY19 on behalf of the.
Cuban Government or sent to Havana according to instructions he
received. GB had found out that AMVHIP/1 knew Trafficante in

Miami and, had contacted him to act as a messenger to Trafficante.

AMWIIIP/1 was also offered, but declined, sum of money for his

participation in this operation, Asa matter of interest this

ploy for illegal winning from the lottery was first conceived in
1959 by GB and Trafficante but it did not materialize as Pineiro

and perhaps other govt officials would not play ball at that time.

It is interesting to note that, for the price of $100,000 a week
in foreign exchange, the Cuban Government is now willing to enter
into a conspiracy of this level with well-known gangster elements.
Other people in the Florida area who will probably be affected by
this action are Amlato Batisti (former owner of the Sevil]e

Biltwumre Hotel in Havana) and one, FNU Santos both of whom are also

involved as king pins in the lottery racket, in Florida.



_

’

Accoring to AMMIP/4,-Faisya is the center for this activity:
AMMIIP/1 stated that if we wanted to take any action in this
matter, it would have to be done soon as GB would expect hia to
react regarding the contact with Trafficante in the very near future.
Extreme caution shouid be used in any action in this field as any.
leak might readily finger to AMMLE/ 1. it is interesting to note
that tin an interview with a Garis : Sta fatten ofticer (cited Para 5-
Giadrid)4386), GB stated that he hud turned down a DSE request to
work for them overseas. He had however offered to become involved
jm illegal business aeats abread.on behalf of DSE. He never received
a reply to this offer. It is also noted that, according to AMMIP/1,

Cor» is not witting that he (AMWIIP/1) has this opportunity to :
act as a go-between with GB and Trafficante on this matter.

b. Luis Blanca Fernandez, Vice Minister of Communications.

(1) In response to the question AMVIIP/1 stated that he
knew Blanca slightly but had no significant assessment to give on
the man, He did know that he was an old DR member and that the
best sources of information on him would be AMLASH/1, /2 and /3.

ce. AMNIP/I i

(1) In discussing the general situation in Madrid and
Europe, AMWHIP/1 again deplored the use by KUBARK of ANNIP/1
in operations against the Castro Cubans. He stated that he didn't
know him personally but that many people had told him that AMNIP/1
was no good and a person in whom one could have obsolutely no
He cited for an example how AMNIP/1 had told the

(1) AMMHIP/1 mentioned this man may in fact have a

brother, Enrique ZAYAS Bazan, who is syupathetico and
working at the parking lot at the Miami Airport. He had found
nothing to add on this lead other than that provided in _

g. AMMIITP/1' 5 itinerary in Europe.

(1) For the record, AMVIIP/1 varied his itinerary

during his last trip in Europe to some degree from that agreed

upon with his Headquarters case officer. Mis {tinerary was as

follows: New York to Paris, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Milan, Madrid,

Miami. eee

who knows AMCRUMB/1 well, plus a great many people who are still

in the Cuban Government today. (Writer's note: This lead should

be followed through.) |» ot

: in (Paria) 0253 (IN 37416). AWHIP/1 repeated his feelings as
basically reported: in; tive r rcuentiotied cable. te stated that _
Colbsare/r0 in discussing the incident actually was very fair to
Gnlskart/9 wed: had staped-ahat be was triny Sersy to have had to

dteutes(iSsxart/9. He said however that G:RSNAFU/9's pugilistic

attitude and threats to hiwself as Cuban Ambassador to France

could simply not be tolerated, He stated that had this flare-up
osskary

by u/S taken place in Havana, then it might have been

dealt with as a man-to-man matter rather than as an ie a pl

to-employee matter. He also said that he hated to eureCudsaaru/9
due to the latter's friendship with AMNIP/1 and AMMIIP/1, As a
result or@sekru/o's being fired, his wife also lost her job with
the Cuban representation to UNESCO in Paris, She has since
however found another job in UNESCO working for the delegation of
another country.
i. as 19's recent trip to Havana 7
(1) Because of the interest in the “coincidental”

trip to Havana of noth @Skaru/19 and AMCASH/3 shortly after
having received the "planted" information of the MISPAWN operation,
we queried AMWHIP/1 regarding( 19's trip. AMWHIP/1 stated that,
to the best of his knowledge G19 went home because of the
precarious condition of his mother's health. (wyi0 was called by
Foreign Minister Roa in Madrid and advised that he should return.
cyio carried certain medicines with nim for his mother. AMWIIP/1
did not know the nature of the mother's illness, but apparently it

mother should be traced). AMMIIP/1 stated et AMLASH/2,
3
Garcia-Bunga, and Gallerreta all confirmed(tY19's mother's

illne: Carrillos left for Havana on about the 29th of March.

“oy d+ for the record AMMUIP/1, in discussing the(UNSKAFU/9-
Gsnaru/19 affair, stated that only(uyis and his family and the
code clerk (Clavista) and his family now are living in the Embassy
building itself. The living quarters for a number of the other __

Cuban mission euployees are now located in the Consular. (Check
this)
k. AMLASH/3 returned to Havana
(1) "Cucu DeLeon told AMWHIP/1 three or four days ago

in Miami that AMLASH/3 had called from Madrid very recently and
stated that he was going to return to Havana. AMMHIP/1 had no.

other details on AMLASH/3's return or whether in fact he had

actually done so.

1. AMLASH/2

(1) AMWHIP/1 stated that AMLASH/2 and 3 were indeed
disillusioned with the Americans to date, AMLASH/3 still believed
that it had. been through the office of the-Awerican Government
that he had been refused a visa to the Dominican Republic. (It
will be recalled that AMLASH/3 had complained of this before to
AMVHIP/1, and AMWHIP/1 had Ueen instructed to suggest to AMLASH/3
that. it was his own known employment by the Governuent of Cuba in
a legitimate capacity which was probably reason enough in itself
for the Dominican Government to refuse him a visa.) AMMIIP/L
stated that ‘he had used this argument with AMLASIL’3, but that
AMLASH/3 remained convinced that there was more behind the refusal

the Americans, that he was generally displeased because Americans
would use people like AMNIP/1 and then did not wish to talk to, \
let alone deal with, people like himself and AMLASH/2. He did
not Cabo into the discussions in Madrid between AMVHIP/1, AMLASH/2, ES
and Q@upront/1. AMNHIP/1 did say that there was no point in trying”
to argue with these people at that tine, or to defend the possible
American positions vis-a-vis them, because they were in fact so.
convinced in their own minds that there would be little use at
that time in trying to change their views (this poiat at a
subsequent fuller review of these discussions should be conducted:
in Spanish by Swenson at an appropriate time in the near future).!
u. MISPAWN Operation

(1) AMWHIP/1 did not have much addi @lonat information
to contribute concerning his MISPAWN talks with @i9 beyond that
reported in(P (@aris>o3ss (IN 41111), He did say, however, that he
had actually given the name and address of Mr.-(Collado) to :
Carrillos who included this in his cable about the matter directly
to Celio Sanchez to Havana, AMWHIP/1 stated that he digressed
slightly from the story as given him in the briefing because he
felt that if he pin-pointed Fidel as the one leader who must go,
Givto would possibly then not have taken such quick action on the

matter, and in fact, may not have reported it at all. AMWIIP/L

(1) Regarding(Uy19's offer for AMMHIP/1 or AMWHIP/2
to travel to Havana on 7 May with a french theatrical group in
order to examine: additional paintings, gems, and other loot taken
from Cuban refugees and now offered for sale by the Cuban Governuent
to obtain sorely needed foreign exchange, AMMIIP/1 stated that he
would need an answer on this matter fairly soon. (It will be noted
that we told(Paris) in DIR 99724 that there was interest in this
offer and that we were secking a suitable candidate). Since
Headquarters has not had a suitable candidate for this trip and
did not have prospects of developing one who could make the trip
securely, we asked AMNIIP/1 if he had someone in mind who could
make the trip. AMWHIP/1 stated that he thought an "experienced"
person of our choosing would be able to get more useful information
for us. We stated that perhaps it would be best not to involve
an agent witting of AMWIIP/I's true relationship with KUBARK in
the event that the agent was arrested and forced to talk. We told
AMWIIP/1 that as a safer, but obviously less desirable, alternative

we might have an unwitting person go in, because much of the

information that he would normally cet as a result of a legitimate
to KUBARK,

business interest in the loot will be in fact of use

and we were willing to forego maximum "take" for the trip in the

wy business partner in Mitdn, Oreste Corletto, would be willing
to make the trip for me." AMWIIP/1 did not have details on
Cortetto at his fingertips but said that he would either send
thea or téléphone them to "Harry Wills" the follMeing days.
AMWHIP/1 stated however that Corletto, who is about 44 years old
arid born in-Milan, is very pro-American and defends the American
position in the world at the drop of a hat with-anyone who takes
issue. AMWHIP/1 stated that Corletto had just returned from a
pleasure trip to Moscow and that if anything, was even more pro~
West and pro-American after this experience. (Follow up soonest)

az
GOBANET/19 Gas-Light Club Membership
(1) 1t has suggested. previously that AMWIIP/1 buy

Gysxur/19 a membership in the oe Gas-Light Club as a gesture
of friendship and good will. Gattaru/io, according to AMMIIP/1,
enjoys the Gas-Light Club and its attractively dressed (or
undressed, as the case may be) hostesses. It is noted for the
record that Nester Sanchez Originally had had the idea that it
might be possible to use this Gas-Light Membership in order to put
a willing, witting, and attractive woman againa t(CSBNAPY/ /19 to
attempt the type of classic operation.

In other words, the Cubans in the interest of economy are prepared

to sacrifice a degree of security. AMIIP/] stated that if we

had a girl who could handle this assignment, he would be willing to
oz
propose her employment to(UNSNAFU/19. (This we should follow up

soonest). This lead also was received by cable according to

subsequent to the undersigned's leaving WH/Cuba.

3. Security

There were no instances of a security nature to be reported.
However, it is the recommendation of the undersigned that the

me case officer/s conduct their meetings with AMWIIP/1 away from

his office as much as possible. There was nu reason to believe

that any of AMWHIP/1's employees have overheard any conversations
in the past, but they probably are well aware that the undersigned
is not always calling on AMMIIP/1 to discuss strictly commercial
matters, Since there may be a change in the complexion of the
AMLASII/1 operation and an increased operational use of AMWHIP/t
in Europe, it would be well to vary the pattern of meetings with
AMHIP/L., There is probably no danger in calling on him at his

office occasionally, but prolonged conversations and too frequent

meetings with the new case officer on the premises should be

avoided,
