Although the Intelligence Division was not requested to

Memorandum from J. H. Geer to The Director

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

Report on the FBI and CISPES

(U)

FISA, includes

domestic groups that are believed to be providing

personnel, training, funds,

or other means for the commission of

terrorist

acts abroad."

This statement is an inaccurate

conclusion of law which we could see in the future as

determinative as to the intent of Congress in which activities

they choose to consider as under our counterterrorism program.

Footnote 89 acknowledges acceptance of the current definition of

terrorism as being the one favored by the FBI. The fact

this particular definition is utilized in FISA, as well as in the

Attorney General Guidelines governing the conduct of the

intelligence aspect of our counterterrorism cases, is a quantum

leap from the conclusion that our investigative jurisdiction is

derived from the FISA.

The definition utilized by FISA is

determinative only for jurisdiction of the FISC. (U)

A case in point are the requirements for subjects of

counterintelligence activity in FISA, which are more stringent

the requirements of our counterintelligence guidelines for

subjects of a full counterintelligence investigation.

In fact,

entire class of cases, those involving targets of intelligence

REQUEST OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLICENCE

Director's Sec'y -

(SSCI) FOR A BRIEFING ON SOVIET EFFORTS TO INFILTRATE

ILLEGALS INTO THE UNITED STATES AS POLITICAL REFUGEES

PURPOSE: To recommend the Director approve the briefing of

Senator SIMPSON (R-WY), Senator BOREN (D-OK), and Senator COHEN

(R-ME) by the Intelligence Division on the captioned matter.

DETAILS: Attached is a request from Senator ALAN K. SIMPSON,

Ranking Minority, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on

Immigration and Refugee Policy, for a briefing on September 7,

1989, at 10:00 a.m. concerning Soviet efforts to infiltrate

illegals into the United States.

As the FBI does not ordinarily

provide such classified information to other than the

intelligence oversight committees, CAO contacted SSCI staff to

inquire of Committee interest. Both GEORGE TENNET, Staff

Director, and JIM DYKSTRA, Minority Staff Director, expressed

interest

on behalf of Chairman DAVID L. BOREN and Vice Chairman

WILLIAM S. COHEN. It is anticipated that either Chairman BOREN

or Vice Chairman COHEN would attend the proposed briefing along

with Senator SIMPSON. Mr. TENNET proposed that the FBI treat the

SIMPSON reguest as an SSCI request.

If Chairman BOREN or Vice

Chairman COHEN

cannot attend the briefing, Mr. TENNET and MI.

DYKSTRA will sit in on their behalf.

Dear Director Sessions:

Senate Select

Parmittee

on tidelligence

This is in reference to a recent conversation between

Richard W. Day, my chief counsel on the Subcommittee on

Immigration and Refugee Policy, and Steve Hooks of your agency,

concerning the growing numbers of immigrants, parolees, and

refugees from the Soviet Union entering the United States.

I

am writing to request

a briefing from the Bureau on the

possibility of the Soviet Union infiltrating agents into the

flow of refugees and other emigres to the United States from

the Soviet Union.

It has been called to my attention by several sources that

the Soviet government might well be using our refugee program

for that purpose.

Legislation ie norently pending in the comerees to

= 116395-1736

provide a presumption of refugee status to all members of

certain groups within the Soviet Union.

The bill, if enacted,

would make a substantial number of Soviets presumptively

eligible for our refugee program, which gives rise to such

concerns about the infiltration of agents into that flow.

I would appreciate having the briefing after the AWest

congressional recess.

If 10 a.m., September 7th, is

acceptable, that would be a good time for me.

be a good time

NOV 6 1989

Mr. Day has a top secret clearance and will be available

196499277548561

during the August recess to help arrange the briefing.

I appreciate your consideration of this request.

Most sincerely,

STAFF TO THE WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN FIELD OFFICE (WMFO)

PURPOSE :

To recommend WMFO host SSCI staff on 11/18/88.

DETAILS: On 11/1/88, John I. Eliff, Professional Staff Member,

SSCI, advised that he; James H. Dykstra, Minority Staff

Director; Britt L.

Snider, Minority Counsel; Edward P. Levine,

Professional Staff; and Charles Battaglia, Professional Staff,

wish to visit WMFO

on 11/18/88. Mr. Eliff was reminded that a

letter from the Chairman would

be required for a field office

visit and advised that a letter would be produced.

The visit

to WMFO was briefly discussed during a 10/26/88 meeting at

FBI Headquarters concerning an update the SSCI is preparing of

a 1986 study entitled "Meeting the Espionage Challenge: A

Review of United States Counterintelligence and Security

Programs" and will be used to gather information for that

update.

In that regard,

Mr. Eliff requested that ar

Intelligence Division (INTD) official in a policy

position accompany the SSCI Staff during the visit. CAO agrees

that,

given the subject matter,

this is a reasonable request

and is in the interest of the FBI.

On 11/2/88, SSA Monty C. Strait, CAO, and John S.

Hooks, Jr., CAO, met

with Messrs Eliff, snider

and Dykstra

develop issues

for the visit at WMFO.

Those items are set out

below.

CAO notes that SSCI requests to visit offsite

operations will likely be impossible given time constraints.

Provide an explanation of WMFO's organization for

counterintelligence and criminal investigative

matters.

An organizational chart would be helpful

to demonstrate how resources are deployed.

Honorable William Sessions

Director

Washington, D.C. 20535

Dear Director Sessions:

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is

conducting a comprehensive review of U.S. counterintelligence

and

security programs

and capabilities.

Included in this

review will be Executive branch efforts to stem the flow of

sensitive technology and equipment to foreign governments.

Recent press reporting has alleged that such transfers

have been made by the military offices of Egypt and Israel.

Accordingly, I request that the FBI brief the Committee staff

unauthorized transfer of technology and equipment from

the United States by the Egyptians and by the Israelis. For

the latter, we are particularly interested in any role played

in these transfers by the Israeli Defense Procurement Mission

and Trade Center in. New York.

Sincerely,

Saich Loren

DETAILS:

State (USDS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel in

During these discussions, Mr. Hale was advised that

staff members of the SSCI had recently visited West Berlin

concerning counterintelligence issues and Mr. Hale, in that

context, wished to brief Mr. Eliff regarding the FBI's

perspectives on opening a Legal Attache, particularly from a

counterintelligence point of view.

Mr. Eliff stated that although he had not recently

visited West Berlin, he was intimately familiar with the

intricacies of the counterintelligence atmosphere in West Berlin

and supported the FBI's presence there.

He indicated he was well

aware of the gap which existed in the counterintelligence

coverage of U. S. civilians, both students and businessmen in

that neither the U. S. military nor the U. S. civilian

intelligence intelligence components were addressing the threat

to these individuals and this for two reasons.

The first involved the basic functions of the U.S.

DETAILS CONTINUED:

technical surveillance and mail openings. Mr. Eliff stated that,

as an occupying power,

domestically, is the entity which conducts telephone monitorings

of criteria country establishments and personnel in the U. s.

sector of West Berlin.

It also opens certain mail of interest

from the Fast which passes through this sector.

However,

whenever there is an overhear of a U. S. national or whenever

there is mention made of a U. $. national in a piece of

correspondence,

that U. S. national's name is not disseminated to

any other U.

intelligence agency.

This lack of dissemination

is as a result of a lawsuit in the early 1970s against the U. S.

Army which, at that time, had in fact been monitoring the

activities of U. S. nationals.

As a consequence of this lawsuit,

very stringent guidelines were written which compelled the U. S.

military to use the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to

monitor Americans including stringent guidelines for minimizing

overhears of U. S. nationals when monitoring non U. S. nationals.

The net results of these restrictions is that, according

to Mr. Eliff, 15 years worth of overhears of U. S. nationals as

well as the like potential collection of names

u. S. persons

via mail openings has been lost.

Mr. Eliff advised it was his belief these minimizatio

International Affairs (OLIA) and the

Counterintelligence Situation in West Berlin

DETAILS CONTINUED:

As an aside, Mr. Eliff indicated that Allan Kornblum,

office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Department of Justice,

had visited West Berlin on two occasions and was conversant with

this U.

s. military monitoring issue.

Mr. Eliff also stated that he further supported an FBI

presence in West Berlin in that his study of the

counterintelligence venue in that city indicated to him that the

many double agent cases run by the U.S. military there were run

for parochial reasons with no strategic view of

counterintelligence.

He stated that even though the U. s.

military services were professional and did coordinate

the

turnover of some of their many double agents to the FBI when

these agents are rotated back to domestic assignment, he believed

the FBI should have input at the outset of these double agent

cases insofar as the double agent technique was a fundamental

counterintelligence tool which demanded consultation with the

principle counterintelligence service, the FBI, at their

inception in order to better globally address counterintelligence

issues.

He stated he believed FBI presence in West Berlin would

therefore be necessary if the U. S. were to have a coherent

national counterintelligence strategy.

to the USDS, the U. S. military and the CIA as well as Mr. Jeff

Smith, Chief Staffer for Senator Sam Nunn, the latter also well

versed in counterintelligence issues and a potential strono

supporter of the FBI's cause.

Messrs L'Allier, Hooks, and Hale thanked Mr. Eliff for

his time and indicated that the

FBI had designated a new

ssistant Legal Attache in Bonn whose function would largely be

to travel weekly to west Berlin in order to prepare the FBI's

case for a permanent presence there.

Memorandum R. L. Leffler to Mr. E. J. O'Malley

Re:

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) Stati

Request for Briefing Concerning

the Marine Resources

Company Joint Fishing Venture

Mr. Butterworth requested a briefing on the counter-

intelligence implications of a proposal made to Senator Jackson

by Bellingham Cold Storage Company, Seattle, Washington, to

establish

servicing and dry dock

Bellingham,

repair facility in

Washington, For Soviet Fishing vessels.

The

vessels would dock for repair for a two to four-week period

and

would be accompanied by a maintenance crew of 25 to 50

Soviets.

These maintenance crews would live on the ships

being repaired, would be allowed free access to the port

community and would be rotated back to the Soviet Union

every six months. (U)

I advised Mr. Butterworth that this proposal was

similar to one made in 1979 by Bellingham and that the FBI

had

recommended against implementation at that time because

it represented potential for significant intelligence

exploitation by the

Soviet intelligence services.

Moreover,

it would constitute a major drain on our investigative resources

which would be required to effectively monitor Soviet activity

in and around Bellingham. Our reasoning was based on the fact

that there were major sensitive defense installations in the

area and that Soviet intelligence personnel, fully capable

of mounting HUMINI gathering operations, undoubtedly would

be assigned to the semipermanent Soviet complement. It was

also speculated that the Soviets would eventually require

some type of permanent shore facilities which would add to

the coverage problem. (C)

It was further explained to Mr. Butterworth that

insofar as repair work on the Soviet vessels by U.S. persons

was concerned, it would probably be limited to the exterior

of the ships, with any interior work being done by the Soviets

in order to protect sensitive SIGINI gathering equipment

known to be aboard at least some of these vessels.

Hence the

need for such a relatively large Soviet "maintenance crew." (C)

Mr. Butterworth was told that from the FBI's view-

point nothing has occurred since we last studied this matter

that would alter our recommendation against the implementation

of this proposal.for counterintelligence reasons.

Briefing provided by Acting Section Chief Rodney L.

Leffler and was attended by Margaret Owens, Congressional

Section.

COMPANY JOINT FISHING VENTURE

PURPOSE: To advise of the above.

DETAILS: On 1/26/83, Mr. Bob Butterworth, Senator

Jackson's designee on the SSCI, telephoned Congressional

Affairs Section and

requested

a briefing concerning

a proposal by Bellingham Cold Storage Company, a Seattle,

Oregon business which is part of the Marine Resources Company

Joint Fishing Venture.

The proposal relates to establishing

a vessel repair operation for Soviet fishing vessels in the

North Pacific. It is expected that these vessels will dock

at Bellingham, Washington, (or as an alternative, in Coosbay,

Oregen)

for 2 to 4 weeks for repairs.

The crew of the vessels

will return to the Soviet Union but a Soviet maintenance group

of 25 to 50 individuals would remain to supervise the work.

These individuals would live on the vessels but would be free

to visit the port community.

These maintenance crews would

be rotated back to the Soviet Union every 6 months.

Senator Jackson has been advised of the economic

Dear Judge Webster:

Thank you for your letter of 7 December replying to our

questions raised at our Committee's counterintelligence brief-

Ing on 28 October.

We hope you will amplity your response considerably so

that we can understand

as clearly as possible the threat fac-

ing us and the protective responses we should be developing.

Ne understand that, in some instances, appropriate CorrectiV€

action must be taken by agencies and departments outside the

intelligence community.

We on this Committee are interested

in helping to affect such changes, but to do so effectively

we need complete and actual information.

In this spirit, we hope you can provide, by 25 January

1982, fuller and more detailed responses to our

questions pro-

viding, at a minimum, more information on the following topics:

KGB active measures:

Please provide recent examples of such activities in

the U.S. with an assessment and analyses of their

success.

Please describe the level and type of FBI effort against

such activities.

Please provide examples of such activities in Western

U.s. countermeasures,

analysis of the success of each side.

.,.

Unlike the Bureau's FCI guidelines, its domestic

security guidelines for domestic terrorism investigations have

not been revised significantly since 1976.

Should they be reexamined

in light of any specific problems that have arisen over the past

five years?

Although it is believed that the Guidelines have enable

the FBI to cope with the domestic terrorist problem in an effective

manner, the Guidelines limit the use of one of the most effective

:.

investigative techniques at our disposal.

The Guidelines

forbid

the FBI to develop and direct the activities of an informant

against an individual or group unless that individual or group is

currently the subject of a full domestic security investigation.

Thus, we cannot continue to operate an informant in a group

once that group's activities fail to meet the criteria for a

full investigation. This prevents us from obtaining valuable

information regarding the group's possible decision to return to

or instigate violent actions prior to these actions taking place.

This prohibition has also created an obvious lack of intelligence

data to assess the terrorist threat. In view of this, a re-examination

of the domestic guidelines as well as all guidelines should be

undertaken on a periodic basis.

Memorandum from Mr. E. J. O'Malley to The Director

Re: Director's Appearance Before

Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence, March 25, 1981

SYNOPSIS:

On March 2, 1981, a preparatory meeting was held at Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) Headquarters chaired by Admiral Showers of

the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Staff and attended by representatives

of CIA, Department of Defense (DOD), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),

and the FBI. The purpose of this meeting was to block the time necessary

for each agency head to make a statement and answer questions. The

enclosed questions were handed out and each agency present is to draft

answers and submit them to CIA for distribution to all participating agencies.

Another meeting on the same matter was held on March 3, 1981,

with Staff members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to

discuss the Director's March 25th appearance before that Committee.

In the past, intelligence community members responsible for

counterintelligence were afforded individual appearances. This year all

such members will appear jointly allowing cross commenting and questioning.

This is a marked change and a departure from the notion that each agency

in turn would appear and answer questions for a limited time.

The emphasis in questioning will be the Committee's perception of

a lack of strategic planning within the community from a multi-disciplinary

counterintelligence view.

Specific questions asked the Director will center on Bureau strategic

planning and the role of foreign threat assessment in this planning.

Opening remarks are expected to specifically justify resource

requests through concrete appraisals of hostile intelligence service threat.

It appears that the thrust of these changes is to force the Intelligence

Community to establish mechanisms for threat assessment and strategic

planning below the White House level where they will fall under Congressional

oversight.

Memorandum from Mr. E. J. O'Malley to The Director

Re: Director's Appearance Before

Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence, March 25, 1981

RECOMMENDATION:

That Intelligence Division prepare an appropriate briefing book

for the Director.

DETAILS:

Three Staff members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence

met with representatives of the Intelligence Division on March 3, 1981. The

purpose of this meeting was to discuss the scheduled March 25, 1981,

appearance of the Director before that Committee.

In the past, members of the Intelligence Community have been afforded

individual appearances before the Senate Select Committee. The March 25,

1981, meeting has been scheduled as a simultaneous appearance of all

Intelligence Community chiefs having counterintelligence responsibilities.

It is the intent of the Committee that this be a joint appearance. That is,

while individual statements from each Intelligence Community chief will be

expected, questions may be directed to any member appearing, allowing

cross commenting on answers of other chiefs. This is a marked departure

from previous procedure.

The emphasis in questioning before the Committee this year will be

into who has overall responsibility for counterintelligence operations from

a multi-disciplinary view. How is the counterintelligence "puzzle" put

together, and how can the Committee augment the budgets of each Intelligence

Community member to increase the effectiveness of the total counterintelligence

effort.

Memorandum from Mr. E. J. O'Malley to The Director

Re: Director's Appearance Before

Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence, March 25, 1981

DETAILS (Continued):

In line with these directions, questions can be expected to center on

F'CI strategic planning, FBI strategic planning and the synthesis of the

multiple threats of foreign intelligence services into a coherent response.

Participants should additionally expect specific questions as to illegals

presence, numbers of foreign recruitments and their threat, war-time

contingencies, the utility of budgetary augmentations (what could be done with

an additional 10%), and changes in the law which might increase performance.

Participants have been requested to address, in their opening remarks,

the following three major areas pertaining to the area of inquiry being conducted

this year.

1. What is the mechanism within your organization for assessing the

overall hostile intelligence threat and how do established mechanisms in

your organization allocate resources to respond to that threat?

2. What is that threat both quantitatively and qualitatively citing

concrete examples?

3. What resources are needed by your organization to meet this

threat?

It appears that the thrust of these changes is to force the Intelligence

Community to establish mechanisms for threat assessment and strategic

planning below the National Security Council level where they will be within

the Senate's oversight responsibilities. During this meeting, one Staff

member, Mr. John Elliff, stated that these matters were currently

"unaccountable" as they were done by the White House staff, implying that

the Committee wished to extend its oversight to the strategic planning

mechanisms.

Re: Director's Appearance Before

DETAILS (Continued):

The Staff members present in the March 3, 1981, meeting were

Angelo Codevilla, employed by Senator Wallop, Chairman of the Budget

Subcommittee; John Elliff, from the same Committee and formerly

with the Bayh Committee, experienced in budget matters and John Pingree,

a new Staff member. Bureau representatives were Dennis I. DeBrandt,

Unit Chief, CI-3 Section, D Unit and Supervisors Richard M. Alu, Robert P.

Hanssen and James D. Ohlson of that Unit. Supervisor Irving A. Bassett, Jr.

of the Congressional Affairs Office was also present.

This joint appearance also was the subject of a March 2, 1981,

meeting convened by the Special Assistant to the DCI for Counterintelligence

and attended by representatives of agencies having FCI responsibilities.

The views expressed by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Staffers,

as above, were not fully conveyed in this meeting. It was agreed at the

March 2nd meeting responses would be exchanged between participants by

March 18th. As of this writing, the participants are as follows:

Admiral Bobby Inman, Deputy DCI

(27) That need do you see for creating a broad, national-

level, strategic, multidisciplinary counterintelligence program

which includes a closely-coordinated counter-SIGINI, counteI-

imagery, protective

security, counter-espionage and counter-

deception progiam?

What 'is being done to hasten this process?.

(b) What steps are being

bility of the U.S. Government for interagency and comprehensive

national foreign counterintelligence (FCI) analysis and

production?

(c) Given the admitted increase in threat from foreign

-=:

intelligence activities, way is there no increase in resources

allocated for counterintelligence (less than 2 percent of

NEIP) ?

(28) A= least sèven different agencies are involved in

comterintelligence work -- FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA and the three

nilitary services. Each agency has its own approach to counter-

intelligence, and the emphasis in recent years has been on better

operational coordination and on preparation of an inter-agency

threat assessaent.

(b) Should there be more of a joint effort by senior

FBI, CIA, and Defense Departuent officials to assess the

overall quality of our counterintelligence efforts and to

promote: improvements and innovations for dealing with the

threat across the board?

(29) The FBI gets by far the largest share of the national

intelligence budget for counterintelligence, and Director Webster

has made counterintelligence a top FBI priority. Last year

this Comnittee recommended that the FBI move towaids the

creation of a separate entity in the Bureau for counterintelligence

so that it could play a more effective role as the lead agency

in this field. Inis is especially important for countering the

HUMINT -collection efforts of Soviet and other Comunist intelli-

gence services.

(a) Would a stronger FBI leadership role in this

field meet with any significant resistance. from the intelli-

gence commnity?

(30) Inese is some evidence that particular agencies, such

as CIA and liSA, may not be adequately collecting and disseminating

counterintelligence that the FBI needs to monitor possible

foreign intelligence threats to this country. This problem may

be due to a fear of collecting and disseminating information

about U.S. citizens, so thai these agencies do not use the full

authority they have under current guidelines.

(2) Does this appear to be true, and if so, what can

be done to encourage CIA and iSA to use their full authority

to support the FBI's counterintelligence requirements?

(b) Roat unrealistic restrictions on counterintelligence

activities nost need revision?

(31) The issue of technology transfer is one which affects

many parts of the government, not just the intelligence coumunity.

•(a) that role do you see fos counterintelligence

in providing information concerning technology diversions,

espionage directed agains: Anerican high technology (both

civilian and defense-related) and key financial and business

data obtained through COMINT?

(b) Do you believe a national level program is required

to

combat this threat?

(c) Should counterintelligence information obtained

by the intelligence commity be provided to the private

sector?

(32) TesTorist poses a serious threat to world stability,

as well as to the physical safety of individuals.

(a) What is the intelligence community doing to give

Anerican policymakers comprenensive analyses of worldwide

terrorisa, including the links among countries and groups

and the factors that increase of reduce terrorist activity?

(b) Is the community preparing the kind of estimates

that will best help policymakers understand terrorism problens

and the likely consequences of U.s. policies for dealing

with those problems?

(33) Although the NSC Special Coordination Committee for

Counterintelligence has responsibility for counterintelligence

policy, there has been a lack of long-range strategic planning

in this field.

(a) Has the NSC committee undertaken any long-range

•strategic planning for U.S. counterintelligence programs?

Memorandum to the Assistant Director

Criminal Investigative Division

PROPOSED ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE LEGISLATION

The impetus for the first change came from the

FBI, which for several years has urged the Department to

life endangering situations.

tie dangering situation into to me con

change above has come from the domestic policy staff of

the White House in response to the recent Supreme Court

case United States v. Dalia,

_ U.s.

(April 18,

1979).

The bill also requires prior notice, when

practicable, to the issuing magistrate for subsequent

entry under the same order to repair or replace the sur-

veillance device.

When prior notice is not practicable,

notification to the authorizing judge should be made

within 48 hours after the re-entry (see page 30, Section

5[91 [iiil).

Previous Congressional requests for prior

approval before the re-entry and for additional minimiza-

tion provisions have been dropped.

Bob McNamara of Senator Kennedy's staff is

anxious to introduce this legislation as a Kennedy bill

and has requested that it be submitted as soon as possible.

Accordingly, Ms. Warlow requested that Bureau views be

provided to the Department by Monday, 7/23/79.

Stearns has provided copies of this draft legislation to

Section Chiefs Douglas Gow and Shawn McWeeney of the

Criminal Investigative Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.

That the Criminal Investigative Division

review the attached draft and advise SA Stearns, Legal

Counsel Division, regarding its impact upon Bureau

investigative operations.
