and silasing it again. Then you lose the umbrella and you can

see the President.

I we have photographs taken by other people immediately

after the shooting. Everyone in the plaza is facing the

knoll, running in that direction, and the umbrella man and

his friend are the only two people standing facing the

complete opposite direction and then the umbrella man is

sitting down, which no one else is doing. That is why the

critics have focused on him so much, though they have never

seen this particular photograph.

Chairman

a Ma Stokes. MI. Devine has offered a very good suggestion.

Mrs. Burke. Could I suggest a resolution that would

authorize the Chairman, in his discretion, to approve the

press release, consistent with the dignity of the committee,

not involving the committee in an umbrella theory and consist-

ent with Time-Life's permits.

Mr. McKinney. I would so move.

stokes. You have heard the resolution. Do you

want a record vote?

Mr. Blakey. I don't think that is necessary.

There are a couple of matters of information you should

be aware of.

The committee is going into court on Monday in Memphis

to examine the records of a hospital dealing with

There are two other matters I would bring to your atten-

tion.

One is an outstanding issue. Former President Ford

was a member of the Warren Commission. Some time in the

next thid tasty days he probably ought to be talked

to and I would solicit your advice on the way in which that

occurs.

If he is in town for another purpose, it might be

appropriate to have an executive session in which he could

come in and talk about the Warren Commissionand his role on

it.

If he is going to be in Colorado for any period of

would it be advisable for the committee, with due dignity, to

release these to the press with an effort being made to

solicit anyone who could identify the individuals?

4 The umbrella man is in no sense a central figure in the

committee's investigation. He is a central figure in the

critical literature. The argument is made that he had an

umbrella on a sunny day and that the umbrella was raised

just before the assassination and was somehow a signal

relating to the assassination.

If it were possible to identify him and have him come

forward, it might be one way which that aspect of the

critical literature could be explained.

Our ability to identify him simply by showing this

photograph to people in Dallas is limited. If we release

it to the press,. they could obviously give it nation-wide

circulation.

There are plusses and minuses if we did this. It might

appear to some credible people we are pursuing the umbrella

man theory, which lacks a certain credibility.

On the other hand, if these are printed and we indicate

we don't know who the person is, I suppose one of the first

things that will be raised is, "Why didn't you give it to the

press earlier? We could have identified him at any time."

I don't know that there is an easy answer either way.

I also don't know that this is a terribly important issue,

but if we were to do it; it probably ought to be done now and

it would require a committee resolution to make them public.

^Ms Stokes.

Mr Spoda.

Mr. Dodd. I have read that one "Thirty Seconds in

Dallas." In fact, they even have it that there is a gun in

there; that you open it up and it fires. I just wonder how

many theories there are. I know the signal theory and I know

about you opening it up and somehow there is a triggering

mechanism in the top

of the thing. Those are basically the

two.

Mr. Blakey. Yes.

Mr. Dodd. The former having a lot more support, I

presume even among the critics, than the latter.

He is one of the mystery figures. It is the

kind of thing people want explained. Why would a man have an

umbrella up on a sunny day?

Mr.

Fauntroy: The thing that has always puzzled me about

this is, with all the attention focused upon this theory,

we have had no one to come forward (from Day One) to say

"I am

With respect, therefore, to the question, shall we

publish this in the hope of finding the person, I tend.

He looks like he is 65 years old in that

That would make him 80 today.

#

Mr Fauntroy. No; that is not the man.

The question is, what public relations value is there

to feeling that we are pursuing every lead? I just don't

think it will be productive. If people have been talking

about the umbrella man and he hasn't come forward i

Mr. Dodd. If that is our only public pronouncement, I

think it is going to focus an awful lot of attention on this

one single aspect of the thing. It makes it look as

though we place a lot of credibility in that.

Chairma"stokes.

Mr.Edgar.

Mr. Edgar.

One of the suggestions I would have on a

public pronouncement would be to make, on the first or second

day of public hearings, a major emphasis on this photograph.

That way you would have major IV coverage with a statement

that at the beginning of our hearings it and this is one of

the unanswered questions

go out to thepublic now on this one picture, people will

pick that up and say, "Oh, they are only pursuing that idea

and that thought."

I It would have to be handled very well.

Mr .)

McKinney. Obviously if I were

"the umbrella man"

and all of a sudden people were writing about me, I would

be the last person to come forward.

A president has been shot and who wants the FBI, Secret

Service and everybody else pouring over them because they

were sitting there with

an umbrella.

This is the first time we have seen this man's face

and I think we should say many of the critics have mentioned

this umbrella man and we have found no vast importance to

it, but here is his face and would someone please come

forward and tell us if they know him?

The individual himself would be cragy to come forward.

Mr. Blakey. This is the first time there has been a

picture of him from the front. In the past it has always

been a person from behind.

If the background was given to the newspaper people

and the statement was made, "This is only one among a number

of things being pursued by the committee and it is not of

central importance to us, but is a question raised by the

critics and it is a matter of some interest that he be

identified

Devine. Have we other photographs we could have

identified at the same time to lessen the focus on this one?

Mrs. Burke. I

suspect there are other photographs.

Chairman

• Stokes. When you release this photo and ask the

press to find out for you who he is, doesn't this lend

credence then to precisely what the press is saying?

"See

there, I told you; they haven't found out anything."

I think you just invite that reaction from the press.

Mrs. Burke. Of course, we could indicate we have found

a photograph of the umbrella man, which nobody else has until

now.

Mr. Devine. But we would want to talk to him as a

witness rather than as a suspect.

Mr. Fauntroy. It would be nice to clear that up one

way or the other.

Mr. Mckinney. One thing the critics will say is that

they didn't follow up the umbrella man.

Mr. Dodd. They are going to be saying things for the

next hundred years. If we go into this thing with that in

mind, we will be basket cases.

Fauntroy.

This photograph is after the shooting.

Chaiman stokes. Yes.

ME.

Mr.McKinney. He is probably lifting his black umbrella

to indicate some protest.

Mr. Fauntroy. After he is shot he sits down and says

"Well, let's wait here."

Mr. Devine. Do you know what was the temperature that

day?

Mrs. Goldsmith.

Mias

Barker

About 65.

Mr. Devine. Some people have an umbrella to shield

themselves from the hot sun on a hot day, but 65 in November

wouldn't apply.

Mr. Preyer.

Mr. Chairman, would it be possible for Mr.

draft

Blakey to thaw up the proposed press release they would

propose to use to release this and see whether it would

meet with your approval?

I agree that how it is presented is crucial. Of course,

it could be misinterpreted regardless of how it is presented.

We are going to be a loser on this one any way we go.

It does have the thrust of a new photograph and if it

is presented in the right light so it does not appear we

have bought the umbrella man theory, it might indicate the

committee's desire to be thorough and follow up all leads.

Otherwise, we could be accused of not following up an obvious

step.

Mr.

Devine. Must he be identified with the umbrella?

Mrs. Burke. We could say this was a man whose photo-

graph we have and we have not been able to identify him and

if anybody knows him, will:they please write us.

Mr. McKinney. Are there any modern photography

techniques that will upgrade those, pictures?

Mr. Goldsmithe

Miss Burken No. This is about the size of a pinhead

in an eight by ten. It has already been enlarged and en-

hanced and the grain is caused by the lack of information.

There is no information there. If you saw the original

8 by 10, this is maybe just a odefinch i the umbrella man

may be ofle inch by ope inch and the photograph is eight by

If you saw the rest of the picture,

you would see in the background people running around, up

the grassy knoll. There was a series of seven photographs.

This is one of the seven. You can see people running in the

background. It is just mass confusion. The photographs before

the assassination, people are standing there watching.

I Mr. Devine.

How many seconds per frame would you

estimate?

Mr. Goldsmith. I couldn't say that.

Mr. Devine. Each frame is supposed to be in a second

segment. Is this just a straight photo and not part of a

motion picture?

Mr.Goldsmith.

That is right.

Chaika"stokes. What does zapruder show the umbrella man

doing?

see it opening up, being raised, lowered, raised again,

simultaneous with the shooting.

time, it might be appropriate for three members of the

committee to go out and see him. I would suppose that prior

to contacting him in a formal sense, it might be appropriate

for the chairman to call him and outline for him the general

areas of our interest and concern.

I Most of the other principal figures in the warren

Commission and cabinet who we have talked to, of all of them,

obviously President Ford presents a special problem.

Mr. Devine. I know he has accepted an engagement at the

Danny Thomas Hospital out there.

I could in quire and find out when he will be in the

Washington area.

Mrs. Burke. Given our financial situation, if he is

here, it would be preferred if we could do it here.

Mr. Devine. He will be glad to do this without

publicity because if the word gets out we are going to question

him, it would be difficult. Perhaps he could be met somewhere

öff the Hill.

Mrs. Burke. I am sure that could be arranged.

Mr. Dodd. This doesn't relate directly to President

Ford, but are we going to bother with inhabitants of the

car

We have not talked to Mrs. Connally.

4/ Mrs. Burke. It is likely Governor Connally might be a

witness in the hearings.. We didn't feel it was necessary

to present him to you in executive session.

Mr. Dodd. We will be apprised of what he will be

saying.

Mr. Blakey. Absolutely.

Mr.Dodd. There is no reason to call Mrs. Kennedy, I

presume?

Mr. Blakey. I hadn't thought about it. I have not

talked to the former First Lady.

Mr. Devine. I can anticipate a question

from President Ford,

what do you want to talk about?'

Mrs. Burke. If you are going to make that phone call

what we should give you before hand is a briefing memorandum

where we outline for you the various areas. Frankly, I think

the committee probably has a duty to, in addition to going

over how it was formed, and the pressures under which it

worked, airing what came out of the release of the FBI

document. That is, had Congressman Ford served as an

information conduit for the FBI from the Warren Commission.

There are memoranda written by de Loach indicating that is

the case. I am aware that the newspapers of, I think it is

CBS, has talked to President Ford about that and he has an

explanation for it. I do not think that interview has been

aired. I believe it was

NBC, where Carl Stern talked to him.

However you want to do it.

Chairman

this

Mr Stokes.

It would appear that then)is the way we

should proceed.

Mr. Blakey. There is one other item I would bring

up at this time before I suggest we go into the briefing and

that is if the committee wants to discuss the memorandum that

I circulated to you with the suggested date for the King

hearings, the Kennedy hearings,

and the King hearings again

in the public meetings i I think Mr. Eagar, you wanted to

speak to that.

Mr. Edgar. I have a couple of questions, or one specific

one that I need to raise and that is, Floyd Fithian and I

have been fairly active in the kingene and we have tough

elections and we may be counting Ey votes or one hundred

votes at fdu

o'clock in the morning. I notice in the

schedule the day after the election we are scheduled to be

here

at nine o'clock for a public session. I think that is

inappropriate.

Mr. Mckinney. Let's call it impossible.

Mr. Edgar. I would rather come on a Saturday or make

loss of hours.

The Wednesday after election doesn't seem to

be a good day for any of us.

Mr. Blakey•

Would Thursday after election?

Mr. Edgar. I think I could probably make it by

Thursday if I am not packing.

I would urge not to use Wednesday.

Mr. McKinney. The consensus is unanimous that you are

right.

Chairman

Me Stokes. Is there anything further?

Mr. Dodd. I would like to use a few minutes to discuss

his. I have discussed this in the past and I have mentioned

it to a few people on the floor over the last couple of days

about the scheduling itself. We are looking at the week

in August and then the full month of september. I know,

Bob, you have expressed the feeling that it would be almost

impossible to conduct public hearings and be through by the

31st of December. I would like to raise for purposes of dis-

cussion here, whether of not we want to proceed with this

intensive public session in September.

Two, whether of not it is possible to conduct more

shifts on part or all of this until November, December and

write up the report simultaneously, if that is possible.

Mr. Blakey.

MEs. Burke

Let me out line the strategy involved in

setting this up. We are obviously dealing with problems.

If you push it in one place, it will push out in another

direction. I think the first two things that have to be

said is that the

committee has to begin its public hearings

before the end of September on both King and Kennedy because

we will have to come up in September for additional money to

go through December.

#While I am certainly not an expert in politics, having

sat through the hearings and the floor debate on our money

bill the last time, it is difficult for me to believe that the

floor would give this committee more money unless it had

started its hearings.

I think preferably we should finish our hearings as an

integral presentation on both sides. It is just not possible

to do that before September.

In addition, the King hearings would have a special

problem with the appearance of James Earl Ray. We can

anticipate that he will present new material of some kind and

therefore we probably ought to get him out of the way in

August and then finish up the King hearings in November or

we will have the opportunity in September and October to run

down anything he says is new.

If we don't begin in a substantial way demonstrating

our competency, our professionalism and our serious dedication

prior to the votes in September, I doubt that the Congress

would finance it. This means, in my judgment, we would have

to begin in August and September. Then I think in September

Ms

• Berning: Seven ayes, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman

~Mis

Stokes.

Seven members having voted in the affirma-

tive, the meeting is now in executive session and all members

of the public are requested to remove themselves

from the.room.

Mr. Edgar..

Mr. Edgar. Mr. Chairman, before we move to the agenda, may

I inquire as to one of the agenda items, is the schedule for

the public hearings?

Mr. Blakey. Yes.

Mr. Chairman, there are several items for general

• discussion, two of which could require a vote. The main

issue before the committee, or the main question before the

*

committee, however, is thenature and character of the hearings

that will be held next week at night. I will not discuss those

things on the record here, but at the conclusion of themeeting

we can go into a briefing off the record on them so I would hope

the items of business could be handled as expeditiously as pos-

sible so we could get to the main issue which is next week's

hearings.

The first issue I would bring to your attention and

solicit your advice deals with the Ray family.

As you are aware, of course, the committee has referred

to the Department of Justice and the parole poard the question

of John Ray's perjury before the committee.

Il The Department of Justice has informed the parule froard

they are considering presenting the matter to the Grand Jury

and ask the parole Board to suspend his parole for a period of

at least

a month.

The parole Board has indicated to us they would probably

not grant him parole if the Department of Justice decides to

charge him with perjury.

There will be a meeting on Tuesday at two between the

staff and the Department of Justice officials to discuss that

mätter.

I would bring to your attention one other item in that

connection. Evidence developed before the committee indicates

that Jerry Ray probably committed a fraud on McMillan

having to do with checks and other matters, Carol Pepper and

Jerry Ray nade available to Mr oMillan. leading Mr. Melillan

to include in writing his book that the family was a conduit

for funds while James Earl Ray was in prison. It turns out those

materials were fraudulent.

Without going into the details, that transaction constituted

federal wire fraud and is a prosecutable offense.

The issue I would bring to the committee this morning

is whether it might be advisable to refer that matter to the

Department of Justice for possible prosecution.

I solicit your advice on it. If we did settle, we would

have to have a committee resolution turning over to the

Department the basic testimony we have available to us

indicating Jerry Ray's involvement in the effort to defraud

McMillan.

Chairman

Stokes. Mr. Edgar.

Mr. Edgar. Mr. Chairman, having sat through both

hearings having to do with John Ray and Jerry Ray, unless

I

get more information, I would think that the John Ray perjury

should be pursued and the Jerry Ray thing ought to be just

noted in our report and not made an issue of unless we find

more significant evidence against Jerry Ray.

I think we just muddy the waters by going after each of

these cases, or this one case, in terms of wire fraud.

I think our issue is trying to sort out the pieces of Martin

Luther King's death

and I think the pressure on John Ray

may be of value in helping to break the case open, given some

of the new leads we are pursuing.

I think we still have to keep pressure on Jerry Ray

but I don't think that pressure is harassing him, which may

be perceived as harassment in terms of a wire fraud issue.

That is just a personal

feeling on my part.

Chairman

this. Stokes.

Are there other comments?

Mr. Fauntroy: He stated my predisposition on that question

also.

Mrs: Burke. Mr. Chairman, unfortunately I was not at

the hearings so I don't have the background information on the

wire fraud.

Mr Blakey.

What happened is that McMillan, an author,

came to the Ray family to find out more about James Earl

Ray and the relationship between him and the family and during

the course of those contacts, Carol Pepper M James Earl's

sister

M and Jerry Ray, sold to McMillan photographs they

had bought from the Salvation Army and portions of her check

books in which she had entered back-dated interest under two

theories. One is the photographs were of the family and that

the back-dated checks, or check interest, were designed to show

money was coming out of prison and through Carol Pepper's

account, and this played a part in McMillan's book.. He

paid money for those items and he in fact was defrauded by

the Ray family. Mrs. Pepper indicated before the committee

that these entries were fraudulent.. They were, in effect,

forgeries.

Mrs. Burke. I would reserve on the issue of the wire

fraud, but I do think, having had to read the long, involved

statement in the Los Angeles Times about the assassination

developments

It most of which were based on McMillan and his

claim

I think that one way that strategically, if that

information, when that is brought to the public lights

kow and made clear the Justice Department can do with it

what they want, that the whole attitude and approach toward

the committee and the hearings will be different.

# Mr.

Edgar. My suggestion was not to cover it up at all.

My suggestion was it is something that we need to have up

front in our report, up front in our discussions as we go to

public debate and let the Justice Department take it if they

wish from there, but I don't think that it serves a purpose

to tie up our

lawyers now

in trying to 'analyze and share

with the

Justice Department the information at this stage

of our investigation. I may be wrong.

Mrs. Burke. I would agree with that.

I think the timing is very bad and could very easily be

done at the conclusion.

Mr Fauntroy. I would like to reiterate, however, the

view that we must pursue the perjury charge on John Ray

vigorously.

Mr. Edgar. May I speak to that, Mr. Chairman?

Chairman stokes.

Mr. Edgar.

Mr. Edgar. I think that is a really key thing if I am

reading John Ray right, and the testimony we have gotten

from the Ray family. I don't think he wants to spend many

more years in prison and I have a feeling he has not been

cooperative with the committee and its investigation and I

think shortly after we pursue this perjury we ought to get

back to John Ray and have him back either before the committee

or meet him in some context where he realizes he ought

to be

very factual and honest with

us in terms of his involvement.

I think that is a clear case, where we have three or four

witnesses.

Chairman

Al Mies

Stokes. Let me ask counsel

if any analysis has been

made or any evaluation hasabeen made with reference to the

extent to which the perjuredetestimony offs not theeperjune

testimony minutesie testimony of the sister to the

effect they

did commit fraud and so forth

M how it would materially alter

the book itself.

Mr. Blakey.

I would have to pass on a real analysis of

the book.

The argument is made in it that with regard to the

relationship of who Ray was and the relation with the family,

that is not supported, but I would have to pass on a careful

analysis of the book.

I think the point that would be made by the prosecution

can ultimately be made by the final report and the prosecution,

that the Ray family is not a reliable source of information

and authors who have relied on statements by Jerry Ray or James

Earl Ray, or Carol Pepper, have seemingly relied on an un-

reliable source. In fact, there has been fraud committed

against Mr.McMillan.

Chairman

n Mr, Stokes.

Aside from the fact that this information

has been developed in our hearings, has there been any other pub-

lio. acknowledgement of this?

Mr. Blakey. No.

Chairman

Stokes.

This will be new when revealed to the public:

AMr.

Blakey. That is correct.

Mr. Fauntroy. And is

it not a fact that we have found

no basis, no other evidence that checks in fact passed?

The bank records have no trace of those which are

noted

M rather ingenuously, to me d on the bank book which

was shown to McMillan.. I still have not figured out for

myself how she put those two $1,000 entries in in a

fashion to make them look authentic and yet the bank records

show no trace of it.

Mr. Blakey. It was a matter that probably ought to be

taken up now if it is going to be taken up. The staff has

no special interest in pressing it or not pressing it.

I understand the:sense

Of the committee is that we

reserve it for the final

report.

The statute of limitations is such that we have a year

after the final report in which the Department can pass on the

prosecution. There is not a time factor.

Let me raise with the committee a second question.

You have had passed to you copies of photographs. The source

was from Time-Life. They are enlarged. The individual you

see sitting on the curb there is the so-called "umbrella

man," with a front view of him. It would be possible if

you knew him, I suppose, to identify him. These pictures

came into our possession in this form only a week or so

ago and the issue I present to you. for your resolution is,

and glasing it again. Then you lose the umbrella and you can

see the President.

Iwe have photographs taken by other people immediately

after the shooting.

Everyone in the plaza is facing the

knoll, running in that direction, and the umbrella man and

his friend are the only two people standing facing the

complete opposite direction and then the umbrella man is

sitting down, which no one else is doing. That is why the

critics have focused on him so much, though they have never

seen this particular photograph.

Chairman

a Ms. Stokes. Mr. Devine has offered a very good suggestion.

Mrs. Burke. Could I suggest a resolution that woüld

authorize the chairman, in his discretion, to approve the

press

release, consistent with the dignity of the committee,

not involving the committee in an umbrella theory and consist-

ent with Time-Life's permits.

Mr. McKinney. I would so move.

Chairman

Mr Stokes. You have heard the resolution. Do you

want a record vote?

Mr. Blakey. I don't think that is necessary.

There are a couple of matters of information you should

be aware of.

The committee is going into court on Monday in Memphis

to examine the records of a hospital dealing with Lisa

Stevens.

Lane

I All of you have received telegrams from Mark yad asking

you to waive your congressional immunity as the price of a

consent of turning over the hospital records. You should be

made aware of the legal position of the staff.

Mark the has no standing in law to participate in

proceedings at all.

He was notified of them as a matter of

courtesy.

You should also be aware that it is the position

of the staff that the statute regulating the control of access

to hospital records does not apply to a congressional com-

mittee; that our subppena would be adequate and that the

court would be so informed but that we are obtaining a court

order to do it to make the hospital administrator feel better.

Mark tyrd would have no standing in that proceeding at

all.

There are two other matters I would bring to your atten-

tion. One is an outstanding issue. Former President Ford

was a member of the Warren Commission. Some time in the

next thili tasty days he probably ought to be talked

to and I would solicit your advice on the way in which that

occurs.

If he is in town

for another purpose, it might be

appropriate to have an executive session in which he could

come in and talk about the Warren Commissionand his role on

it.

If he is going to be in Colorado for any period of
