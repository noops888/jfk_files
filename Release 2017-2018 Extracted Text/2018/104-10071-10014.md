SUBJECT

Attempted Anti-U.S. Demonstrations in kingston

Following Assassination of Martin Luther King

1.

According to the Special Brance of the Jamaica

Security Service,

there are four groups trying to instigate

demonstrations against the American Embassy in Kingston,

Jamaica, since the assassination of Martin Luther King, but

they have met with no success.

A group of Jamaican leftists, including

Winston Monroe, are in contact with an unnamed Black

Power advocate

from the United States who arrived in

Janaica some time during the week of 1-6 April. It

was not known whether he arrived before or after the

assassination.

The Special Branch advised our representative

In Kingston that it had learned that the group planned

a small delegation to the area near the

American Babassy around noon on 8 April to see whether

they could start any disturbances.

The group had

considered stoning the imbassy, but gave up this idea.

The Black Power advocate from the United States is

reported to have commented that since the Government

of Jamaica is in complete sympathy with Dr. King, it

take any action.

The police

are expected to have a

stand-by force

to neet any adverse development, and

feel that they can control the situation.

graduatas of the University of the West Indies (UNI),

succesS.

(Field Comment:

Tuesday, 9 April, so they aro free for action, 11
