MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT : Attempted Anti-u.s. Demonstrations in Kingston
following Assassination of Martin Luther King

1. According to the Special Branch of the Jamaica
Security Service, there are four groups trying to instigate
demonstrations against the American Embassy in Kiagston,
Jamaica, since the assassination of Martin Luther King, but
they have met with no success.

a. A group of Jamaican leftists, including
Winston Monroe, are in contact with an unnamed Black
Power advocate from the United States who arrived in
Jamaica some time during the week of 1-6 April. ait
was not known whether he arrived before or after the
assassination.

The Special Branch advised our representative
in Xingston that it had learned that the group planned
to send a small delegation to the area near the
American Embassy around noon on 8 April to see whether
they could start any disturbances. ‘The group had
considered stoning the Embassy, but gave up this idea.

reported to have commented that since the Government
of Jamaica is in complete sympathy with Dr. King, it
will be difficult to get demonstrations started. The
police believe it is uncertain that the group will
take any action. The police are expected to have a
stand-by force to meet any adverse Gevelopment, and
feel that they can control the situation.

y b. Leroy Innis, President of the Guild of Under-
graduates of the University of the West Indies CURT),
tried to get UWI students to demonstrate, but without
Success. (Field Comment: The Students are on vacation
and are not scheduled to veturn to classes until
Tuesday, 9 April, so they are free for action, if any
Spark catches.)
