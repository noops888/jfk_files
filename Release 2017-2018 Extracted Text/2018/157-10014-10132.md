facilities and so forth and so on, these costs are not costs

in the sense that they/are exclusively devoted to intelligence.
I mean, if we were, for example, to have no intelligence, that
doesn't mean you would) save that entire $10 billion. These are
in effect, I think those who. worked on the defense budget
before are aware of what indirect costs are and how one calculates

them.

Those essentially| are the two numbers. There is, of al
a

a dispute about whether it is necessary or desirable to reveal
the numbers, and I might just. say in that connection, the
primary reason for giving the global figure is in part to
|

settle a lot of public|debate about these enormous costs of.
I

intelligence in a manner which will make it clear what it is
one has been talking aout, and that in fact a lot of these
are indirect costs, a ‘lot’ of these are tactical and integral
to the normal funetioning of military commands.

The Pacommandaeicee start on page 114, and there are only

three of them. I think the decision of the Committee has to
go to the question of ‘the’ numbers to begin with, whether they
should be indicated in| the text, and then the recommendations,
the first of which being that there be a national intelligence
budget, tee it-be made public, that the figure, the global
figure for the national intelligence budget, which would be

the $4.7 billion, be madb public, and that the Committee-

}Subtotal, national intelligence effort.

Mr. Quanbeck. We also propose to release the $9.7
billion to show some relationship to what the House has already
released. They released a figure of $10.5 billion.

Mr. Kirbow.. I think the Senator's question went to in the
future, annually.

Mr. Quanbeck. Yes, that would be the $4.7 billion.

Senator Huddleston. I don't know whether we ought to
change that figure from $10 billion to $9.7 billion.

Mr. rereee I think we ought to use the same figure all
the way through.

Mr. Kirbow. I think ie you say $10 billion and jump back
to $9.7 billion -- if you just say approximately $10 billion.

Senator Schweiker. waa is the reason of the Subcommittee
in releasing the $4.7 billion ae opposed’ to the $9.7 billion?

Senator Huddleston. well, $4.7 billion represents more
of the direct costs of our national intelligence. You have
got three different figures there. As you go up to $6.9
billion you are picking up your tactical and military intelli-
gence. Then when you pick up the next $2 billion or so there,
that is support costs that while they are necessary for intelli-
gence, they are not necessary just because of intelligence.

You could probably goljon -- they would go on even if you
eliminated all ‘of your intelligence.

were no intelligence activities funded by it through the

Senator Tower. Well, $10 billion is more powerful than

$4.7 billion because it is |higher.
Senator Baker. I knéw that and I knew that would’ be the
answer.
Mr. Aaron. I might say that there is also the consideration
that the $4.7 billion number, under our proposed oversight

committee, it would be the|number that was authorized and

therefore presumably would|have to be made public in the author-

ization bill.
Senator Tower. Anything further on Section VIII?
All right, Section 1x!
Mr. Aaron. The next /section deals with chemical and
biological agents and the intelligence community, and I
might call on Elliot to describe it because he did most of the
work in this area, you recall. We had a hearing on the subject
of the toxins and what have you. We also had even more I think
in-depth analysis of the whole problem of drug testing as
it existed in the CIA and to some extent in the military.
Elliot?
Mr. Maxwell. The section tries to deal with both the
testing and the shift from) defensive to offensive concerns as
well as the problems involved in particularly the surreptitious
administration of drugs to unwitting, non-volunteer human

subjects.

In a’ related matter, another person was killed as a result of
a military intelligence testing program conducted in New York.
These were very highly sensitive programs that were begun in
response to a concern by the Agency and the military that
individuals in the American government or agents of the
American government would ibe kidnapped or held by hostile
powers and would have these drugs used against them either: for
interrogation purposes or to gain: control.

They soon, however, became used as testing programs for
our use of.chemical and eitiogie st agence These included not

only the toxins, but also testing of LSD, sodium pentathol among

others. The problems involved were not only the concern over

the human rights of individual subjects,but the procedures

within the CIA, in this. case, in which internal CIA's concern
over the security of the pilogram led to the waiving of
certain administrative controls so that in 1957, for instance,
the Inspector General, doing a survey of the whole program, had
no knowledge that there was this particular unwitting testing
program going on.

The Committee reconmerdations go to the question of waiver
of Agency regulations, a problem that we have had all the way

through whereby regulations are issued by the Director and

thus can be waived at any time, and the Committee, or the

||Subcommittee recommendations would require that if there were

Secondly, it deals with the establishment, or really, the

Commission for the Peeteee ica of Human Subjects of Biomedical
and Behavioral Research, which is drawing up standards for

testing on human subjects within the government.

fhere is a piece of legislation, S. 2515, introduced which
would continue the life of|lthat commission ahd would provide
the commission with jurisdiction over DOD and the CIA. The

You have really got to narrow this.

Mr. Maxwell. The | problem it was geared to was if in fact

the Committee chooses to do certain things by way of internal

directives, by requiring Agency. regulations to be amended, there

is at this point no, in particular circumstances, no requirement

that the Director who is responsible for the issuance of those

regulations notify the oversight committee.

that it is too broad now,.|and we can attempt to narrow it, but

it does govern a whole |series of questions directed toward

Mr. Aaron. I think thd first: question, Mr. Chairman, is do

we want to include the Department of Defense in this particular

There is no requirement at this point that if the

Senator Schweiker. I don't really think it belongs here.
I think you really get a can of worms, because I can read this
to have a waiver to assassinate Presidents, you know. We've
got a policy. There is no: statute now, and our policy is to not
asSassinate, so we can waive and say it is okay.

Senator Huddleston. Why don't we just strike the waiver

Senator Tower. You can look at it another: way, too. To

the extent that this procedure-is required of any kind of regu-
lation, be it a minor regulation on stafé travel policy or
some damned ‘insignificant ‘thing like that.

Mr. Maxwell. I think that is correct. As it is now drawn,
it is overly broad, and I fon't think it belongs here. I think
it probably belongs in ‘the: question of whether we make clear at
some point that fully and currently informed includes any
question: of waiver of major regulations by the Director.

Another example would be that where a regulation now
provides the Inspector Genéral have access to all information,
that could be waived and has been waived in the past by the
Director in order not to allow the Inspector General to have

access,.and in that condition you would want the oversight

committee's to know thalt such a waiver had been made. That

is why this is a general recommendation.

Senator Schweiker. But you are setting up a bypass route.
That troubles me because it seems to me you go into any area,
you can get around it by alwaiver: I would rather not address
ourselves to the subject and make it clear he has'to issue a
new regulation. After all, he can still amerid his own

‘
regulations. If it is just a regulation, the way to do it is
amend the regulation. Why give them a cause to cheat?

legislation which says "fully and. currently informed," of anything

|
beyond a nitpicking, minor, trivial things that the oversight
committee would not bel worried about. The committee would be
informed it would be the obligation of the agencies to do
it.
Secondly, in the general provisions here, we have the
provision for a classified Federal Registry where regulations
i

are required to be deposited, and the oversight committee has

access to any changes in regulations, including such things as
i

waivers and so on. i
|
So I think in those two ways, the kind of question that

Elliot is worried about ae is covered. So I don't think
it is necessary.

Senator Schweiker. So |let's delete it then..

Mr. Aaron. Well, before we do, may I make one comment?

First of all, I think it should be understood that the
Director of the Agency writes his own regulations. The Directot
of the Agency can amend his own regulations whenever he
wishes, and the Director of the Agency can waive his own
regulations whenever he wishes. The regulations may be secret
or classified regulations. And he may waive them or amend
them in secret.

Now, there are a taneee of recommendations that we make

that go to the suggestion; that certain regulations be adopted

by the Agency. For example, we have had. an extensive Msevesey

of the use of academics or certain categories of personnel.

They have a very |inportant regulation called 50-10, which
regulates how they can use Americans or members of the Vatican
or members of the Red Cross or numbers of different kinds of
people. Some of these regulations say, you want to use somebody
you have to get a waiver, or sometimes -- well, there ae all
sorts of provisions like that.

Now, I think the patne of this suggestion was to make it
clear that in these imporgqnt policy cases, if there is to bea

i

waiver which can take place on a classified basis, it is

brought to the attention of the oversight committee, for these

matters, not for the normal personnel and such issues.

Mr. Kirbow.. Might I suggest that if the Committee desires

notice of changes in regulations on major policy questions, that

we simply have the staff rewrite this to say that and put it

back in the other section and consider it next time around.

Mr. diGenova. There has to be a caveat in there that even
though you are vatiing about a waiver, you are still not talking
about anything that — with the laws and the

(
Constitution of the united States, because we say that all the
way through, and the waiver cannot encompass a violation of
a law that the Congress has passed.

Senator Huddleston. That ought to be added. to the ee
recommendations.

Mr. Maxwell. I think that is where it belongs.

Senator Schweiker. And redrafted back to the connittee.|

Senator Tower. All right. If everybody is agreed,
that will be redrafted and made a part of the general recommen-
dations.

Mr. Maxwell. It would deal with both waiver and promulgating

new regulations. ;

Mr. Aaron, Right.
Senator Tower. Yes.

Mr. Bader. And Elliot, I assume amend the current _

regulations.
Mr. Aaron. May I'suggest in doing this we take the
point made by Mr. Miller and start out by simply saying, in

fskaisaderatial with the policy of being currently and. fully _

informed on all signficant Agency activities, because the only

Recommendations. We have five of them.

I might just say at the outset, these I think fall into the
category of what the staff} would say or put forward as good
ideas, in other words, that we haven't had‘a hearing on each
one of these subjects; our: total experience on Some of them
leads us to feel that some, of these steps would be very useful;
some of them fall into ee I think of helpful sugges-~
tions as to how we might pfoceed in some of these general areas.

The first one on security clearances, I think perhaps Mr.
Miller would want to talk to it.. He had a great deal of
experience with the security clearance problem as this
committee was established, and I think it: flows from his
experience.

Mr. Miller. Well, this very simply is based on our own
Committee's experience on security clearances, and also based
on the GAO study that was made of security clearances.

There are on the civilian side vast inconsistencies in
procedure and practice andidegree of thoroughness in the

security clearance process. The suggestion here is that for

the civilian intelligence community, and possibly for the

from this are economies-and a consistency of purpose and a

This is something that I think would profit well in the
future.

S@nator Tower. okay.

Anything more on that?

All right, personnel practices.

Mr. Aaron. All right. I think the purpose of this is
we have found as we have talked to a number of people in inter-
views and what have you that to ensure in these areas where
there is a potential for people straying across the line of
constitutional rights of others, that there be a conscious
effort made by the Federal Government to inculcate its employees
with the proper idea of. what the law and the Constitution
require. That is the basic thrust of Recommendation B.

Senator Tower. Any comment on that?

All right, Section C, security functions of the intelligence
agencies.

Mr. Aaron. Now, I think this makes a general observation
concerning what the security funetion of intelligence agencies
not involved in law a what in effect the policy
should be. This is not, a recommendation as to precisely how

one might implement that policy, and I take it perhaps you

could inform us, Bob and Mike, as to the Domestic Group If

believe is doing a considerable amount of work on dealing with

the specifics of this.

This would really simply be the policy statement.

Elliot? |
|

Mr. Maxwell. Tee ig a problem in that in that the last
sentence of that, security functions of the intelligence
agencies may be in conflict with the detailed recommendations
of the Domestic Subcommittee, and then a number of activities
which were undertaken under Operation CHAOS and Operation
MERRIMAC were designed in a-larger sense and interpreted in
the larger sense to be based on the authority to protect the
Agency's personnel. and facilities and to ensure that’ intelligenc|
personnel follow proper security practices.

Mr. Miller. But they were abuses of those missions..

There was no problem with the missions, per’ se.

Mr. Kelley. The problem is they didn't think it was an
abuse at the time. They just-interpreted it broad enough.

I think we can flag this to be coordinated. matt

Mr. Kirbow., I do have some serious reservation about the

detail which the Domestic report goes on this, and that isa
general statement of policy, I think this Committee or the
Subcommittee should adopt kind of a general policy that they
do have the requirement and that we think they should be

authorized to do this in each individual agency. Ctherwise
