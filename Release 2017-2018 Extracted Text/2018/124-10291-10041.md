JUNTA. THE FOLLOWING DAY, RIVAS MET LEIGH AND TOLD HIM THAT

HE HAD BEEN SENT BY PRESIDENT PEREZ TO EXPLAIN THE LATTER'S

INTENTIONS IN PERSONALLY ATTENDING THE FUNERAL OF ORLANDO

LETELIER, FORMER CHILEAN AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES

WHO WAS ASSASSINATED IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON 21 SEPTEMBER 1976

AND BURIED IN CARACAS.

2. RIVAS TOLD LEIGH THAT PRESIDENT PEREZ DID NOT MEAN TO

AFFRONT THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT BY HIS ACTION, BUT RATHER THAT HE

ATTENDED. THE FUNERAL TO SHOW HIS RESPECT FOR VENEZUELA'S

DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS. ' RIVAS SAID THAT PRESIDENT PEREZ HOPED HIS

ACTION HAD NOT BEEN MISINTERPRETED BY THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT

AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO HARD FEELINGS BETWEEN THE TWO

GOVERNMENTS OVER THE MATTER.

3.

GENERAL LEIGH SAID THAT PRESIDENT PEREZ' ACTION HAD

BEEN BADLY RECEIVED IN CHILE AND THAT HE PERSONALLY FOUND IT

DIFFICULT, TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT'S MOTIVES. LEIGH SAID THAT

HE UNDERSTOOD PEREZ' RESPECT FOR DEMOCRACY, BUT HE FELT THAT.

LETELIER'S CASE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO SEND A

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE. THE DECISION TO

PERSONALLY ATTEND THE FUNERAL HAS BEEN USED BY CHILE'S ENEMIES

TO EMBARRASS THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT.

4. WHEN QUERIED ABOUT THE VENEZUELAN INVESTIGATION INTO

THE LETELIER ASSASSINATION, RIVAS SAID THAT VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES

HAD GONE ABOUT AS FAR AS THEY WANTED TO GO IN QUESTIONING ORLANDO

BOS CH, CUBAN EXILE LEADER, REGARDING HIS POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT.

RIVAS POINTED OUT THAT BOSCH HAD POWERFUL FRIENDS CLOSE TO THE

VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT AND THAT PRESSURE WAS BEING APPLIED ON

BOSCH'S BEHALF. HE EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT ANY MORE INFORMATION WOULD

BE REVEALED BECAUSE OF THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT'S RELUCTANCE TO

PRESS THE MATTER TOO FAR.

5. (SOURCE COMMENT: THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF"RIVAS' TRIP WAS

TO EXPLORE THE CHILEAN ATTITUDE TOWARD A PROPOSAL BY PRESIDENT

PEREZ TO HOLD A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS OF THE ANDEAN PACT COUNTRIES

TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE IMPASSE BETWEEN CHILE AND THE OTHER PACT

MEMBERS OVER IMPORT DUTIES AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT: VENEZUELA DID

NOT PLAN TO APPROACH ANY OTHER COUNTRIES UNTIL THE CHILEANS AGREED

TO THE IDEA; HOWEVER, THIS MATTER WAS OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS WITH

6. IN REQUESTING HIS MEETING WITH LEIGH, RIVAS ASKED

THAT HIS PRESENCE IN CHILE NOT BE MADE A MATTER OF PUBLIC

KNOWLEDGE. FOR THIS REASON, THE MEETING WAS ARRANGED TO TAKE

PLACE IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE RATHER THAN AT DIEGO PORTALES

GOVERNMENT HOUSE, WHERE THERE IS A GREATER RISK OF DISCOVERY BY

REPORTERS.

7.. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: A REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS AGENCY

COMMENTED THAT. ALTHOUGH: RIVAS HAS, ON OCCASION, HANDLED (S

SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE PEREZ ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AN

ASSIGNMENT AS DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT IS UNUSUAL: IT IS OUT OF

CHARACTER FOR PEREZ TO EXPLAIN OR APOLOGIZE FOR HIS ACTIONS AND

IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT A PEREZ REPRESENTATIVE WOULD ADMIT THAT

BOSCH HAS POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WHEN THE

GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE THIS FACT.)
