 $... In the last elections Jagan ordered sone of his (Indien) Peoples
: Progressive Party (PPP) supporters to join the United Front Party .

(UPP) in order to impress the world in general and the US in particular
that democracy in British Guiana was working. By virtue of the fact /
that the UFP membership was “growing,” it was “obvious” that Jagan

was not a dictator. I was told this by two Indian Guianese who were
working for Jegan.

I vas in British Guiana for about 12 months on my latest trip.

Since much of this time was devoted to geological surveying in the
hinterland, I vas accompanied by an Indien Guianese doctor. A well-

4} educated man of the upper-middle class, he told me that armg were
Yeing smuggled into the country from Cuba. He did not go into any
detail on the subject, but he did mention that his soas, who were
members of the Progressive Youth Organization (PYO) frequently brougat
carms into their houe, kept them for a while, and then. disposed of them.
}Tae doctor was so much concerned -- and pessimistic --.about the
situation that he emigrated from the country shortly after I departed.

to swell. But the disease's affect on men's sexual organs was not
“Jexactly encouraging. ~ I-never.did understend why, but my doctor said
that to be effective in detecting the disease a blood test must be
made at night (preferably between 11 p.m. and 1 a.u.), and analyzed
quickly. If filariasis is treated promptly, a man's sexual prowess
can be saved. We found that the disease is very common throughout

Extremist And Police Activities In Venezuela

Venezuela’ has been afflicted over the past several
months with a rash of Castro-Communist terrorist actions.
*“Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are
connected with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,
‘the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Armed Forces ,~.
of National Liberation -- the Castro-Communist group
credited with the destruction at the Maracaibo oil .
‘fields during the Cuban crisis. These activities are
probably designed to discredit and weaken the Betan-
court Government.

The police have demonstrated considerable proficiency
in preventing major outbreaks and in acting rapidly

to arrest terrorists. They have rounded up extremists
responsible for the holdup and looting of a printing
supply warehouse and the burning of the Dupont paint
warehouse and have captured the Communist leader of
guerrilla bands operating in the Falcon area of
northwestern Venezuela. 7

tional Links vary from country to. country depending upon, emong other
factors, the legel status of the Communiet party, whether diplomatic
representation is located in a country, the relative strength of Comamist
alliences with other leftist or opposition parties, and the charscter of
current government leadership in these countries. Next atteched is an

NEMORANDUMs Cuban Subversion in Other letin American Countries

i. Geneva), Summary

lL. ‘the Castro regime denies that material support ie being gives
any anti«regimd group outdide Cuba, Captra claims that. euch decistance is
umnecdssary since the people of these couttries, thanks to Giba's example,
are becoming avare of their revolutionary yotentiel, The publicly stated
position of the Cuban leaders is that their comtry, “the flret socialist
state in dverica," has become the example, the “beacon”, Infact, however,
Cuba's worel and mterial support to Commnist end Comanist~influenced
groups has been felt in verying degrees in every one of the 19 other Ietin
American yepubites. ‘The Castro regime hes become an effective Instrument
of the Sino-Soviet effort to weaken. and eventually destroy demperatic
polities. institutions in Latin America.

@, Gybaik subversion has become more eubtle since 1959, when a Cubans
woumted expeditionary force was launched agelast the Dominican Republic and
smaller “invasion forees™ left Cuba for abortive attacks on the governmonte.
of Panama, Miceragua, end Hedti. Now Cuban subversive efforts generally fall
in. three categories:

a. ‘The indoctrination end training of hundreds of Latin
Amevicens in Cube;

%. ‘The intensive propaganda beamed at Letin America. by Cuban
radio stations end elreulated through printed meterial and
the Cubanssubsidized intermstionel "news" agency, ands

¢. The overt. material support given subversive groups in
other countriss.

TY. Guban Subversive Programs

A. ‘Training of latin Americans in Cuba:

33 Tidel Castro announced on'9 June 1961 that his government would
grant 1,000 scholarships to “poor students” from other latin American
eountvies for the next school term and 100 scholarships to. students from
other countries of the world: Hundreds of young latin Americans have been
@ubjected to Coummist indoctrination. In addition to whetever formal
training they receive in Subu, many of them receive training in guerrilla
werfere ond other techniques of xevolution,

4, Cubon refugees vho have arrived recently in the United States have
provyidad detailed inforuation on the training programs offered to some of
‘these young Ietin Americana.

HW 50955 Docld:32423736 Page 59



&. One refugee, a deserter from Castro's army, reported from
personal. knoviedge that in late 1961 there were a number of students fron
Chile, Euuador, Argentine, Guatemila, and-Brazil living in @ Havana suburb
who régulerly attended clagses in Marxiem-Leniniom, propaganda techniques,
and other subjects to prepare them for active revolutionary roles in their
homelands, He reported thet. those mile studerita who were between 16 and 20
years of age were sent as pert off theiy training to the Minas del, Frio
trabiing center in Orlente province. During this phase of their training they
received familiarization in the use of smell. erms and hiked to the top of
Cuba's highest mountain, Pieo Turquino, in the Sierra Maestia, the locale of
Castro's guerrilla varfare against the Batista dictatorshtp..

b. Another refugee, who. lived in Oriente province, learned trom
conversations with militia-nuen in the area and from letinn Americans tr
there that continuous training of students from other latin American coustries
is going on at les Aromas, Oriente, The trainées receive instruction in
military tactics, guerrllls verfare, subversion, sobotage, propaganda, and
Comamnist ideology. The refugee did not lmow how many latin Americana were
involved, but believed the duration of exch course vas about eight weeks, after
vhich another group replaced the one that had bean training.

_ 5+ Mitch of the trayél of Latin American students to Cuba for training
and indo¢trination is handled by the Institute Cubano de Amistad con los
Pueblos (ICAP + Cuban Institute for Friendship with Reoples).

. 6 Guba is also a major takeof? point for Latin Amricans traveling to
and from the Simo-Goviet dice. Over 400 Latin Americans returned fron last
July's Commnist~sponsoréd Youth Festival in Helsinki aboard a Soviet passenger
vessel vith the 400«mon Cuban delegation. They disexbarked in Havana and
stayed in Cuba some weeks before some of them began retuning to thedy home

9; ‘The program to the Dominican Republic, for imstence, is announced
as the program of the Dominican Idberetion Movement (MLD), and the program
is entitled Patria Libre. At present, Radio Havana beams the 20 minute
Petrie Libre program to the Dominican Republic on Thursdays end Saturdays.
Just prior to the program, the Radio Hevane announcer explains that the,
station is meking its facilities availeble to the MLD for its program.
There are some areas in the Dominicen Republic wheres, due to the ebaence
of lecal redio stations, the Cuban broaiicasts are the only ones heard.
Lest July, the subversive content. of these broadcasts to the Deminican
Republic led the Dominican government to protest to the Organization of
Anerizan States.

10. The content of such brosdeasts is exemplified in the stated goals
of #he “Voice of Revolutionary Niceragus," the progrem which is regularly
beaned by Redio Havans to Nicaragua. On 31 August this program celebrated
its firet anniversary by repeating its original statement of ite purposes:

"She Voice of Revolutionary Nicarague hea set itself the goal
of contributing to pointing out ‘the real way to Micaraguats
lfheration from the dominion of Yankee isperdalism and the
Somoza tyranny. Elections (scheduled for next February to
choose President Semoza's successor) with the Somozes in pover,

program will be et the service of the revolutioneries end
egedinet the electioncers...The Voice of Revolutionary Mceragus
will defend the Cuban revolution because it is an important.
part of the Letin Ameriesn people's Liberating revolution."

1. Cuban propaganda is also disseminated through the offices of
‘Presna Latina, the Cuben-subsidized international “news agency" whith
fas close working relations with TASS, the New Chine News Agency, aud other
propagenda media for the Sino-Soviet bioc.

22. Cuban printed material 1g cireuleted throughout the hemisphere};
Che Guevara's book on guerrille warfare has received wide distribution.
Periodically, the Mexican government, most recently last August, has been
obliged te confiscate large quantities of propanganda materials from Latin
Americana passing through that country enroute from Cube to their homelands.

C. Cuben covert support. for reive Bt

13. Cubsn covert support for Commnist or pro-Cotmmist groups in
other Latin Americen countries 1s provided in a number of ways. In the five
Latin American countries where Cuban diplomitic missions are still resident
{Mesico, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, ond Bolivia) » these missions have often
been the channel. The Cuben embassy in Mexico is mow to have provided

HW 50955 Docld:32423736 Page 61



frequent assistance to exiles from Guntoninla, Nicaragua, and other Central
American countries living in Mexieo. In other instencesa, assiatance is.
provided through trevelers coming from Cube and through Prensa Latina
representatives. 3

Ui. The assistance is usually financial. ‘The Cubané appear to have
been pontind since 1959 to avoid being caught in a bletant act. of subversion
“that be used to justify concerted inter-American action. Pinanciel
assistance is often just as useful and much leds risky than actuel weapons
deliveries. In 6 mmber of American countries, smal) arms and other weapons
‘ere availeble for @ price. Unserupulows or careless arms dealers in the US
have sleo contributed to the arma traffic from which pro-Castro groups have
benefitted, directly or indirectly.

15. As the following country-by-country rundowm indicates, Cuban support.
for subverpive activity hes affected in varying degrees every one of the 19
other Latin Aner ban countries.

a. Argentina: Ernesto "Che" Guevare, an Argentine by birth,
has retainedilits deep interest in Argentina's political affairs. On 25 May,
the Argentine national holiday, he addressed the group of Argentine citizens
vesident in Cube and told them that he hoped that next year they would be
celebrating in Argentine under “the flag of socialism.” At enother point
in. this address he said: “Our revolution is one which needs to expand ite
ideas...and other people sre helping us. Let the other peoples of the hemisphere
get engry and take up arms or seize power end aid us in this task which is
the task of the eutive hemisphere and of humnity.”

the Argentine comamity in Cuba last April organized the
"Cuban-Argentine Friendship Institute” with headquarters in Havana. One
of the leaders is John Williem Cooke, who was for a time chief of former
Argentine dictator Peron's political machine in Argentina. Cooke continues
il active in that faction of the Peronista party which seecka concerted action
with the Argentine Commmiats. Cooke matateing regular contact with sympathizers
inside end outside Argentina through travelers and through his wife,
Alieia Eguren de Cooke, @ resident of Montevideo, Uruguay, who apparently
ce hes regular means of commnication with individuals in Argentina. Argentine
" ¢itisens have been reeruited thréugh this channel to go to Cube for training.
There are elso strong indications that terrorist activities by Argentine
Peronists and Commmists havé been encouraged end perhaps aasisted through
this channel.

Prior to the diplomatic break between Argentine and Cuba .

last February, the Cuban exibassy in Buenos Aires provided finencial assistance
te antl<govermment groups there. An Argentine journalist who hes contacts in
She Vommanist perty there reported lest December, for instance, that the
Argentine Communist party had reeelved the sum of 50,000 pesos from the.

Cuban exbassy as a contribution to the railway workers who were then on
stxike in the province of Cordoba.

HW 50955 Docld:32423736 Page 62



as

Though the @uben exbassy is no longer in Buenos Aires, Cuban
clandestine assistance to Argentine Peronist-Commumist groups continues. On
19 July of this year the federal police in Buenos Aires reported the um-
earthing of. a center of Commmist and Peronist attivities in the capital.

Two Buenos Aires policemen were shot and killed at a surburben warehouse in
June. Investigations revealed that a quantity of explosives snd propayands
were stored in the warehouse. ‘The trail led to the arrest of one Jose

Maria Aponte, & journalist. end known Peronist activist, and one Mario

Massi, owner of the firm which owned the warehouse. It was revealed that
Mesei had been maintaining contact with Cuban Commnists, with John William
Cooke, and with an unidentified women associated with the Cuban exbassy in
Uruguay who was probably Alicia Eguren de Cooke referred to sbove. According
to the Argentine police investigation, some 150 Argentine citizens had been
sent from Argentina to Cuba (through Uruguay and Mexico) for training in \
guerrilla warfare. On their return to Argentina, these men were to be used
in planned activities in the provinces of Pormosa, Tucuman, Salta, and the
wooded areas of eastern Argentina. A number of other individuals were appre- /
hended by the Argentine police in connection with the subversive activity
revealed in these investigations.

be Bolivia: Bolivia has been the recipient of spectel Cuben
attentions. The number of Boliviens receiving "scholarships" in Cuba this
year--between 130 and 150-- appears disproportionately high. The Bolivian
government felt obliged to request the departure of Cuban Arbassador Tebares:
in 1960 and of Cuban Charge Garcia Triens in 1961 for blatant intervention
dn internal Bolivien affairs, including support for Bolivien Communists and
attempts to incite extreme leftist members of the governing MNR party to leave
the party. In June 1961, the Bolivian government published a series of
documents linking the Cuban enbessy vith a Commmist conspiracy to seize
control of the government. One of these documents, a statement by an arrested |
Bolivian egitetor who had been in close contact with the Cuben exbagsy, |
gave the names of a number of Bolivians who had received financial support
from the Cuban exbassy. This evidence was used to justify the request for
the Cuban charge's recall. .

The present Cuban charge in Bolivia, Ramon Aja, has algo been
active though perhaps a bit mere discreet than his predetessors. He has
been particularly energetic in cultiveting relations with Bolivian campesinos.
The peasent union in the Clisa Velley of Bolivia has been reported te be the
recipient. of Cuban financial assistance.

ce. Brazil: During the pasttwo years the Castro regime has

aeveloped increasingly close ties with Frencisco Juliac, self-proclaimed
Marxist and leader of the Peasant Leagues in the troubled northeast region
of Brazil. Juliso, whose wife and children are resident in Cuba, has |
traveled there on seversl occasions, and a number of his esscclates end rank = |
and-file metbers of the Leagues have gone to Cube for agricultural
training which is undoubtedly heavily lerded with ideological Andoctrination.
Transportation direct from northeast Brazil to Cuba has been provided by
Bubana airlines on at least one occasion. Circumatantial evidence strongly

Suggests thet Juliao has received financial assistance for his movement from
the Cuban government. Brazilian Commniet leaders heve privately stated, in

HW 50955 Docld:32423736 Page 63


feet, that Juliao's Peasant Leagues have received not only money but also

shipments of small arms from Cuba. These Brazilien Commnist leaders also
said thet the reason Juliao sent bis family to Cuba wes his fear that they
night be endangered in the civil war he expects to érupt shortly in Bresil,

‘The Cuban government has also during the past year cultivated
particularly close relations with leaders of the dissident Commmist Party
of Brazil (CPB). One of the CPB leaders whe hed visited Cuba last May
told a friend of a long conversation he hed had with Fidel Castro in late
May-. Castro expressed identity of feeling with the dissident Braztiien
Conmmists and criticized the regular Commmist party for its failure "to
take a atrong revolutionary line" in accordance with the decision of the
22nd party congress ef the Commmist party of the Soviet Uston. Castro
approved the insurreetionary policy of the CPB and urged the leaders to
organize guerrille activities and start the revolutionary movement in Brazil
“as soon 48 possible." Castro advised them that government reprisals egainst
revolutionary action in Brazil would serve only :to increase populer dis-~
content in Brazil and swell the ranks of the revolutionaries. He edvised
CPB leaders to give special emphasis to securing eéywide a tase as possible
enong agricultursl workers and the inhabitants of rural areas.

The Cuban embassy in Rio de Jeanetro, like Cuban ombassies :
elsewhere in Latin Ameries, has beea a source of assistante to Communist and
pro~Commmist elements. Last May leaks to the Brazilian press reported dis-
cussions in the Brazilian cabinet on the subversive activities being directed
by Cuban anbessador Joaquin Hernandez Armag. The Navy and Army Ministers are
Yeported to have expressed particular concern over Hernandez’ activities.

a chine: Senator Salvador Allende, leader of Chile's
Commmist~deminated popular front and a leading presidential aspirant, hes
made at least two trips to Cuba.

The Cubsn enbassy in Santiago is the source of propaganda
support for pro-Comamist groups, mostly those associated with Allende, who
are intent on coming to power in Chile through elections or revolution.

Orlende Prendes, ‘cultural attache of the Cuban embassy, is know to be supere

vising the printing of Cuban propaganda on a clandestine printing press in
the home of Julio Bocenegra, who also prints propaganda for the Chilean
Commmist party. This activity has been going on for some time. As long
ago as Aggust, 1961, Chileon officials investigating political agitation
and resulting unrest in the Salamanca area learned thet. efter a visit to the
area by @ Cuban diplomat the previous month, pro-Cuben propaganda was being
distrdouted in the area, and Commmists and pro-Commnists there were soying
“The mountains of Salamanca axe going te be the Chilean Sierra Maestre."

Last March, when Cuban Minister of Education Armando Hart
went to chite for an international conference he took with him several sacks

of propeganda.

@- Colombia: The United Front for Revolutionary Action (FUAR),
organized early this year by Colombian extremists, ig believed to have
received financial assistance from Cuba to promote its Sbjective of creating
© guerrilia movement aimed at the overthrow of the govermment. A Colombian

6

HW 50955 Docld:32423736 Page 64



citizen who has contacts among PUAR members reported last June that Fidel
Castro had just given the group $15,000 and promised further financial
aid semi-annually. Gloria Gaitan de Valencia, the wife of a FUAR leader
and the daughter of the Colombian leader Gaitan whose agcassination in
1948 sparked the disastrous Rogota rioting, 16 a long-time personal friend
of Fidel Castro. He hes visited Cuba frequently and probably xeturns to
Colombia with specific advice and assistance from the Cuban government.
The FUAR hes succeeded in drawing mexbers from the extrenist wing of the
reguiar Colombian Commnist party who are dissatisfied with that party's
reluctance to engage in ipen revolutionary action,

f. Costa Rica: The amell Costa Rican Commmist party, the
Popular Venguard party (PVP), 4e charged by the Cuban government with the
selection of young men to be traizéd ii Cubs. Riboberto. Cermons and Jose
Murillo, PVP members, left Costa Rica last June for training under this
program, and PVP leaders had plans for organizing guerrille training programs
in Costa Rica under the direction of the Copta Ricang who had received training
in Cuba.

&- The Dominican Republie: The provisional Council of State,
which is preparing the country for its firet free elections this December
in more than 30 years, has been a major target for Cuban subversion. A
cadre of Dominican Commnists. is headquartered in Cuba, end elandestine con-
tact is probably maintained with sympathizers inside the Doninican Republic.
Broadcasts to the Dominican Republic from Cuba have helped incite the
frequent ricts in Santo Domingo. The fact that broadcasts from Cuba have on
occasion referred to very recent events in the Dominican Republic strongly
suggests the presence of clandestine radio contacts between the two countries,

he Ecusdor: The Commnist party of Eeusdor has formed the
nucleus of a small guerrille organization. This group was draw Jargely from
the pro-Castro Revolutionary Union of Eeusdorean Youth (URJE), which was
involved in a two-day battle with government forces last April. ‘the leader
of the April affair, as well ss several other Eeuadoreang involved in sub-
versive activities, hea received guerrilla training in Cuba. A URJE leader
told a friend last June that this organization has go far in 1962 received
$22,000 in finaneial aid from the Cuban goverment.

Memel Araujo Hidalgo, pro-Commmist former Eeuadorean Minister
of Interior who has visited Cuba end who recently traveled in Commnist
China, appears to be working with the URJE. He is reported to have received
& considerable amount of money from the Cuban government for his efforts,
according to a private statement by the URJE leader.

4. El Salvador: On 1 March 1961; the Salvadoran government
broke veletions with the Castro regime after it hed received evidence of
conversation between the Cuban charge, Roberto Lassalle, and leading Salvadcran
Commanists in which Lassele urged increased revolutionary activity.

j- Guatemala: On 5 March 1962, a Cuban arrived in Mexico with a
measage for a leader n in Mexico of the Guatemalan Commnist-influenced

HW 50955 Docld:32423736 Page 65


13 November group, which had recently engeged in guerrilla activity in |
Guatemala. The Cuban gave him $4,000 which he said was the first install-
ment of a total of $10,000 to be used to establigh a new guerrilia front

in Guatemala. On 8 March, Castro's emissary gave the Guatemalans the balanne
of the $10,000 and told one of the 13 November leaders that the decision ta
provide them with thé money was teken by Fidel Castro personally. Castro,

be seid, had sent instructions that. the group did net have to account for how
the money was spent, that no strings were ettached, and thet he hopes they
are successful so he can provide them with additional assistence.. Leter the
Cuban emissary met with leaders in Mexico of the orthodox Guatemalen
Comanist party. These Guatemalan Commnists had epparently compleined that |
the Cuban money waa not going to them. They were told that Castro wanted
the money to go to the 13 Novenber group because this group hed demonstrated
ite capacity to fight the Guatemalan government, a copactty which the
Guatemalan Commmists had not show. The Cuban said: “It is not a matter
of standing around with Arab fatalism waiting for events to take place-+- |
We should act efficiently se as to precipitate the death of imperialian.
Reemuse of this we are ready to help anyone who may decide to struggle against
imperialism anywhere."

Cuban propaganda medie have sought through publicizing the
activities of the 13 November group to increase its prestige and chances for
success: A Prensa Latina reporter published an alleged interview with
13 Novewber leader You Sosa.

k. Bedti: A cadre of Heitien Commmists led by Rene Depestre is
resident in Cuba, and many thousands of Haitian citizens living in eastern
Cuba are now being subjected to Comamist regimentstion and indectrination.

a. Honduras: Prior to the breek in Cuben-Honduran diplomatic
rélations in April 1961, Cuban personnel under the cover of consular and
diplomatic offices engaged in proselyting in the north coast region of
Honduras. Honduras now is the target of a particularly vicious regular radio
program beamed especially to Honiuras by Radio Havana. Many Hondurans are
dn Cuba under the :"Skholarghip" program.

g@. Mexicot fhe Cuban embassy in Mexteo City, the consulate in
Merida, end the “Guban-Mexican Cultural Center” in Merida have all g
engaged in propaganda activities designed to encourage the pro-commmist cause
in Mexico, particularly the Commnist-influenced National Liberation Move~
ment (Mon). Former Cuban asbassedor in Mexico Portuonde is reported by people
an elose contact with MLN leaders to have concluded an agreement whereby
goie Of the money sent by Havana to cover the expense of the embassy is ear-
marked as a contribution to the MIN. Mexicen officials were disturbed et the
participation of Cuban exbassy officials in ineiting the anti-US demon-
sbrations by Mexican atudents in July and August 1960. Mexican suthorities
have periodically impounded quantities of Cuban propaganda being sent through
Mexico to other Letin American countries. The most importent aspect of
Mexico in Cuban propaganda and subversive operations in Latin America ise ite
use by the Cubans as a vay station or jumping off place between Cuba itself
end the rest of Latin America.

HW 50955 Docld:32423736 Page 66


n. Nicaragua: A esdre of Nicaraguan Commists ie based in
Cuba. Contact betwaen them and pro-Castro Wicaraguans in Nicaragua and in
exile in other countries of the Caribbean area is maintained at least on a
Bporadie basis. A number of Nicareguans periodically have traveled to Cuba
and some have received training there in guerrilla tectics. Reliable reports
indicate that some of these Cuba-trained Nicaraguans have been enong the
smali guerrilla bands that have infiltrated Nicaragua acroas the largely un-
guarded Hondruen border. The Nicaraguan government is the target of a
regulerly broadcast Radic Havana program to Nicaragua which is announced as
the progrem of “free Nicaraguans."

o. Panemat Cuben Pinanelal assistance is believed to be
channeled to the pro-Commmist Betional Action Vanguard (VAN) in Panema. One
of the VAN leaders, Deputy Thelma King, is a frequent traveler to Cuba end
claims to be a personal friend of Fidel Castro.

Pp Saree Paraguayen exifies in Uruguay and Brazi) have
received Cuba fingneial assistance. Four menbers of the United Front for

National Liberation Vigeg tl & Commmist Paraguayan exile group in Uruguey,
recelve the equivalent. of $230 monthly each from the Cuben embassy in
Uruguay to finance clandestine pro-Castro. activities in Uruguay, according
to a Paraguayan exile in Uruguay who is in close toch with FULINA.

q- “Peru: At least eight Peruviens traveled to Cuba by way of
Mexico last dime “to récetve training end indoctrination in that countrys
Other Peruvian Communists ox pro-Commmisats have long been in Cube and a
regularly broadcast Redio Havana program is beamed to Perus

ze. Uruguay: The Cuben eubassy in Montevideo has been engaged
in promoting pro-Castro propaganda. In Januery 1961 the Uruguayan govern-
ment was obliged to declare the Cuben ambassador persona non grim for
intervening in internal Uruguayan affairs.

8+ Venezuela: ‘The Castro regime has been extremely vitriolic
in its propaganda bleste egeinst the Beteneourt aduinistration in Venezuela.
Cuban eseistance has been channeled to members of the militant opposition
Leftist Revolutionary Movement (MIR), which ig attempting to develop a
guerrilla movement in Venezuela with the ald of its ally, the regular Vene-
zuelen Commmist party. While there is, little evidence to indicate direct
Cuban involvement in this Commmist effort, a significant number of the lesd-
ing figures involved, including Fabricio Ojeda, are known to have traveled
to Cuba, where they probebly received financial and other assistance in
addition to official encouragement end propaganda cupport for their activities,

Policies Toward Latin America

42. Here Castre has more capability for independent
action than in any other field except the internal politica of Cuba.
Gastro is deeply committed to a policy of armed insurrection

throughout Latin America. Because of his own experience he has

; a deep-seated belief that only through insurrection can revolution

be promoted in Latin America. Further, he apparently believes that
a successful revolution in another Latin American country would give
great impetus to the revolutionary movement and would algo consoli-
date his own regime in Cuba. In trying to foment ineurrections, he
apparently does not believe it crucial that he cannot now give direct
military assistance to them, nor does he écem to consider it impor-
tant whether he has or has not Soviet support. For the Soviets,
however, such an inflexible approach smacks of the Chinese position
and causes great problems in dealing with other Latin American
Communists, Most important, however, it is probable that the
Soviets believe such a posture will damage Soviet prospecta for
penetration of Latin America and inevitably bring about a por eren

tion with the US.

18, Cuban overseas military capabilities remain severely

limited by lack of the requisite air or sea lift. The Cubans could

probably not undertake an overseas opesation on a srale larger than
one battalion. For political as well as military reasons, the Gastro
regime is most unlikely to undertake military operations of this nature.
It would prefer to concentrate on rendering clandestine support to

local insurgents.

32. Nonetheless, Castro continues his appeal fer revolution in
Latin America on the Cuban model. Those Latin Americans who are
committed to violent revolution continue to look to Castro for help,
particularly from his training program in Cuba and his large-scale
dissemination of printed and broadcast propaganda. Communist
agitators are concentrating their efforte inereasingly in rural areas,
as they have done in Peru recently, In addition, there has been an
increase in sabotage and other violence perpetrated by extremists,
of the sort not requiring the participation of large popular groups, yet
designed to provoke drastic countermeasurea by governments and to
increase popular anti-government sentiment, These widespread
activities have demonstrated that the ability of local Communista to engage
in terrorist and subversive activities and their willingness to accept Cuban
and Soviet support do not dpend upon Castro~s prestige or upon their

opinion of hia doctrines and policies.

SUPPLEMENT
THE CASTRO THREAT TO LATIN AMERICA

Despite diminished prestige, especially among government
leaders, Castro retains great influence over politically
unsophisticated Latin Americans. He is also supported by
Western Hemisphere Communist parties and the vast majority
of extreme leftists. Castro's main appeal lies in his claim
to be the leader of a successful revolution against "Yankee
imperialism" and in the support he is ready to provide
subversive activities throughout Latin America.

The degree to which Cuba is involved in, current
hemisphere unrest is not clear. Antigovernment nationals and
Communists of various Latin American countries, however,
have made frequent visits to Cuba to receive pro-Castro
indoctrination and propaganda. During 1962, 1,000 to 1,500
are believed to have received intensive education and training
in sabotage and guerrilla warfare. Significant representation
has been noted from Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia, Paraguay, and Nicaragua. There is no definite
proof. that Cuba is now exporting arms to any dissident groups,
but propaganda materials, explosives, and financial support are
reliably reported to have been furnished.

Cuban leaders have also called with increasing frequency
for open rebellion as the "only road" to liberation for the
Americas; they have been especially vociferous since the first
of the year. Leading officials, such as Castro, Blas Roca,
Che Guevara, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, and Juan Marinello are
among those calling for revolutionary violence. The
"Betancourt tyranny" in Venezuela has been designated a
primary target, but Peru and Chile apparently also have high
priority. * The use of the Prensa Latina organization and
the agent network already in existence makes it virtually
sure that Havana will intensify its clandestine activities.

Latin American governments are generally now more alert to
Castro's threat. Inadequate. security forces and widespread
poverty throughout the area, however, make it almost certain
that Cuban-supported: insurgency will have an-effect out of."
proportion to the number of people involved.

Cuban Developments

Following Fidel Castro's call for revolution in

Latin America in his 2 January speech, other Cuban
speakers are emphasizing the same theme. Che Guevara
told a group of Central American delegates in Havana
recently that they must prepare for simultaneous
revolutions in all Central American countries and pointed
to Venezuela and Chile as major targets for revolution.
Long-time Communist leader Blas Roca, on 23 January,
praised Venezuelan Communists for their recent

acts of sabotage and pledged continued Cuban

support for the struggle of the people against the
Betancourt "tyranny." Venezuela has long been a

major Castro-Communist target, and Blas Roca's

remarks imply Cuban support for the present upsurge

of Communist activity there.

1. Armed Incursions.,
No sooner had the Revolutionary Government of Cuba taken power
then it leunched a program for exporting its revolution to other countries

in the Hemisphere, particularly in the Caribbean erea. ‘The memories of
the invasions and attempted invasions of Penana, of Nicaragua, and of
the Dominican Republic, following closely upon one snother in the spring
end summer of 1959 are still fresh. Support of Cuban officials for
militery expeditions against the Governments. of these countries, although

vehemently denied, has béen esteblished beyond reasonable doubt. With

American Republics het ‘piternational ‘tensions in the Caribbean area,

to which Cuba had significantly contributed, had risen to the extent thet
@ Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American
States was necessary.

The Investigating Committee appointed by the Council of the OAS,
acting provisionally as Organ of Consultation under the Inter-American
Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, in the Panama cas@ in June, 1959 con~
cluded "that the Republic of Panama wes the victim of an invasion,
orgenized abroad, that sailed from a Cuban port and was composed almost
entirely of foreigners". The Committee report stated that the Chairman
of the Committee was able to confirm that 82 of 84 imprisoned invaders

were Cubans. Further, the Government cf Panama, prior to the departure
of the invasion group from.Cuba informed the Cuban Government of reports
sbout this impending event, invoking the 1928 Habana Convention on the
Duties and Rights of Stetes in the Byent of Civil Strife. ‘The Cuben.
Foreign Minister in turn assured Penne thet the Cuban Government would
teke the necessary preventive measures.

33, There have been indications of disapproval-of Castro«s
policies on the part of those Latin American Communist parties
which are committed to a more gradual and less violent approach to
revolution. Castro has shown himself willing te collaborate with any
group, Communist or not, willing to resort to violence and in so doing
to circumvent some of the regular Communist parties. Some of the
latter resent such tactics and have appealed to the Soviets against
Castro. It seems likely that the question of relations with other
Hgttiin MArcoxtican Communist parties, as well as the question of tactics,

The air formations included helicopters, propeller-

Seviet participation in the parade has not been established,

reportedly continues, the threat of retaliatory action from forces
rallying around deposed Air Force Chief Lemus has apparently
diminished, an@ the majority of the armed forces still supports
President Ydigoras. The President's intention with regard to
leftist ex-President Arevalo, who plans to return and seek the
presidency in next December's elections, is an unsettling factor.
The armed forces universally oppose Arevalo. Some factions want
to replace Ydigoras with a civilian-military junta and call. new
elections before Arevalo becomes eligible to run in March. Shoulé
Arevalo return, the military will probably move to prevent his
candidacy and the coming months may be critical.

Honduran President Villeda Morales, although not a strong
leader, is expected to complete his term. The ruling Liberal
Party will probably retain the Presidency in the October elections,
d maneuvering for the nomination has begun. Rodas Alvarado,
President of the Congress and one of the three leading contenders,
has used his position to build up strength, but the armed forces
regard him as the least desirable anda developing anti-Rodas
coalition may prevent his nomination. Either of the three leading
candidates would probably follow the present government's policies,

cluding -its relatively soft Communist stand. The Communists,
e not yet a direct threat, are steadily increasing their
influence in the labor field and are exploiting the country's
discouraging political, economic, and social conditions.

El salvador, faced with a serious Communist threat about
two years ago, continues to show political and economic progress,
i there are clouds on the horizon. President Rivera, who
assumed control last summer in a full return to constitutional
government, still has widespread support and military backing.

he government is moving ahead with its reform program, but
there is some resistance to the proposed new income taxes.
Communist activities have been curbed, but the Communists still
retain a subversive capability particularly among labor and
student groups. There is concern over the likely election of a
pro-Communist as rector of the university, a center of sub-
version and vigue.

Costa Rica continues to be one of the most democratic and
politicaliy stable countries in Latin America but there are

Panama is relatively quiet. Although Panama has failed to

receive any commitment for @ long-sought renegotiation of the
Canal Zone treaty, continuing talks on areas of disagreement and
some concessions have eased tensions and softened violent anti-US
propaganda. Public emotion may again be aroused, however, by the
recent petition, filed py a Communist lawyer, requesting the Supreme

| Court to declare the treaty unconstitutional. President Chiari

| has also indicated he expects to press for increased compensation

during the forthcoming talks. On the internal scene, Pres dent
Chiari has failed to provide a strong administration. Corraption
continues; the cabinet is divided by conflicting loyalties and
ambitions; badly needed reforms have not yet peen adopted; and
the chronically depressed economy remains stagnant.

The stability which has marked the 30-year dominance of
Mexico's Party of Revolutionary Institutions (PRI) is gradually
peiug eroded. Extreme right and left factions of the PRI are
vying for domination. In attempting to placate poth, President
p Mateos has adopted inconsistent and vacillating policies,

pleasing neither group. Forces outside the PRI also pose an
increasing threat -- particularly the recently formed Independent
Peasant Central (CCI) with which leftist ex-President Cardenas is
associated. The CCI, organized to exploit unrest among the land;
eo less peasants, may-:also attempt to challenge the PRI politically.
To undercut the CCI, the government plans to complete the land
distribution program by the end of Lopez Mateos' term late next
year. Although this may alleviate discontent in the agrarian
sector, rising population and mounting unemployment will continue
to be major problems.

THE SITUATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA, PANAMA, AND MEXICO

Central America is relatively stable. Preparations are
under way for President Kennedy's scheduled meeting with the Chiefs
of State of these countries at San Jose, Costa Rica, on 18 and 19
March. Tensions are rising, however, in those countries having
elections scheduled this year; Mexico's political stability is
threatened;. and the Cuban subversive potential remains a problem
throughout the area.

During the forthcoming meeting, an attempt will be made to
center discussions on areas of common interest. Economic integra-
tion of the Central American region -- one of the major objectives
of the Alliance for Progress Program -- will undoubtedly be em-
phasizead. Central America, which has been moving toward greater
political unity, has begun to take steps toward economic integra-

“tion, and presently envisages the creation of a Common Market by
1965. The Cuban subversive threat is also likely to be given top
priority. All of the Central American countries regard this as
one of the major problems and are seeking ways to meet it.

> is not @ member of the Somoza family. Rene Schick -- the
overnment's Liberal Party (PLN) candidate and hand-picked by the
sozas -- is expected to win easily, however. Effective oppo-
Ss on to Schick collapsed when the major opposition party --
fraditionalist Conservative (PCT) -- boycotted the elections
because the government refused to permit OAS supervision, The
only opponent is Diego Manuel Chamorro Bolanos, a last-minute
candidate of the splinter Nicaraguan Conservative Party (PCN),
whose entry into the race seems to have been engineered by the
government to provide a semblance of opposition. Castro-
Communist.elements, militant conservatives and others may attempt
to create disorders before or during the elections, but the
Nicaraguan National Guard is believed capable of.controlling
any troubles short of.a general uprising or wel 1-coordinated
rebel invasion -- neither of which seems likely.

Anti-Somoza Nicaraguans have alleged fraudulent registra-
tions and may attempt to challenge the elections. Although
Schick may not turn out to be a Somoza puppet, opposition
suspicions will be reinforced with the likely retention of
General Anastasio Somoza as Director of the National Guard.

pro-Communist Torribio Satas, A government spokesman
laims that ‘the Cuben and Czechoslovak Embassies are
financing the strike and that the Cubans are training
H campesino militia in other areas as well.

President Paz has reportedly said he w do every-
thing to prevent the strike but will call on loyal
campesinos for aid if he fails. If armed conflict
develops between the two groups of campesinos,
the Armed Forces would probably be forced to step in.
President Paz might also have to take action against
trouble makers like Salas, something he has tried to
avoid, : i

' The company executives attributed the pro-communist

No-conclusions, obviously, should be drawn from such
slender ‘indications... It has been my observation, however, that
“most Brazilians either believe that a communist take-over would

be impossible in Brazil, or. believe that even if it occurred, it
would take a.relatively mild form with which they could live. The

@ virtue,, could in the present state of. affairs be the cause of his undoing.

Peruvian Communist Elements Coordinating Their Activities

Orthodox Communists in Peru are apparently putting
aside their differences and moving toward closer
co-operation with the extremist Trotskyist faction,*
believed to be leading the recent outbreak of
disorders. The groups are rep edly co-ordinating
previously random plans to carry out extensive
destruction of industrial and agricultural
installations and to provoke uprisings. Cubans and
other Latin American nationals as well as Havana
and Moscow-trained Peruvians are said to be
instrumental in this latest development.

Members of the Peruvian junta have expressed
serious concern over the internal situation

and hinted that they faver strong action. Although
constitutional guarantees have been. suspended-in a
fourth department ,and several Army units have been
moved into the areas of disorders, the junta has
taken no further action. It has requested riot
control equipment from the US and says it is

ready to embark on an anti-Communist program upon
assurance that the equipment is forthcoming.

Peruvian Junta Makes Firm Anti

SECRET—-NO FOREIGN DISSEM

Continued Communist-incited disorders and an alleged
Havana~Mcscow plan to take over the government
prompted the military junta to suspend constitutional
guarantees in Peru and institute a nationwide state
of sieége early on 5 January. Military commanders
assumed political control in their respective zones,
end a reported 800 Communist Party leaders and pro-
Communist subversives have been arrested. The

Lima headquarters of several Communist and
Communist-front organizations, as well as their
publications, have been closed.

According to the Communist plan, subversive activity
was to have been intensified between 15 and 20
January in all parts of Peru, with assaults on
banking and commercial institutions, military
garrisons, vital communications facilities, and
univer es. <A clandestine radio station operating
on the Bolivian border allegedly was to direct

and co-ordinate this activity.

a has regarded members of the leftist but
mist American Popular ‘Revolutionary
Alliance (APRA) a greater danger than the

Communists and originally tended to blame them

for the disorders. There is no proof that APRA

has been involved in anything but legititmate

strike activity. Suspension of constitutional
guarantees would enable the junta to strike at

APRA to Giscredit and weaken it before the scheduled
elections next June. (SECRET)

SUPPLEMENT

THE VENEZUELAN SITUATION

A number of high-ranking Cuban leaders since the first of
the year have publicly called for revolution,in other Latin
American countries, with Venezuela singled out as a country
with top priority.

Coinciding with these appeals have been reports that the
Venezuelan Communist Party (PCV) planned to step up terrorist
activity to discredit President Betancourt before his US
visit. The recent incidence of “terrorism, which has included
attacks on the US Chamber of Commerce office building and the
burning of Sears, Roebuck warehouses, is apparently part
of this campaign.

Involved in the current terrorism is the Armed Forces of
National Liberation (FALN). The FALN, although purporting to
represent all of the opposition, includes some prominent
Communists and is emerging as a paramilitary force of the PCV
with its main strength in the Caracas area.

Guerrilla bands also operate in western Venezuela, but
there is no firm evidence that their activity is coordinated
with that in the Caracas area. Venezuelan army units, with
air support, have been used in a recent campaign against
these guerrillas.

The armed forces are generally capable of maintaining
internal security and of defending the nation's borders
against neighboring countries. The vast majority supports
constitutionality and is loyal to the Betancourt government.
The armed forces would not ‘hesitate, however, to take over the
government in order to maintain order or to forestall a
Communist uprising. The armed forces were earlier greatly
frustrated over the government's inaction against Communist-—
instigated disorders. Betancourt's recent willingness to
take more vigorous action, however, coupled with the strong
support given the US during the Cuban crisis, has overcome
much of this dissatisfaction, and armed forces’ support of
the government is greater now than it was six months ago.

The officer corps is generally free of Communist
penetration, although there has been some infiltration in the
Marine corps, two or three battalions having been involved
in leftist-led revolts during the spring of 1962.

SECRET-NO FOREIGN DISSEM

Extremist And Police Activities In Venezuela

uela has been afflicted over the past several

s with a rash of Castro-Communist terrorist actions.
Many incidents, involving shootings and robberies, are
connected with the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,°
the Venezuelan Communist Party, and the Armed Forces
of National Liberation -- the Castro-Communist group
credited with the destruction at the Maracaibo oil
fields during the Cuban crisis. These activities are
probably designed to discredit and weaken the Betan-
court Government.

The police have demonstrated considerable proficiency
in preventing major outbreaks and in acting rapidly
to arrest terrorists. They have rounded up extremists
responsible for the holdup and looting of a printing

- supply warehouse and the burning of the Dupont paint
warehouse and have captured the Communist leader of
guerrilla bands operating in the Falcon. area of
northwestern Venezuela. (CONFIDENTIAL)

Venezuelan Communists Plan to Increase Violence

77 As part of its terrorist campaign, the Venezuelan
Communist Party reportedly plans to mark the fourth
anniversary of Betancourt's presidency on 13 February
by guerrilla bombings in the Caracas area, Other
Communists are to see to it that the capital is
flooded with propaganda that day. According to un-
confirmed reports, Venezuelan authorities have
charged the Castro government with ordering the recent
terrorism in both Venezuela and Colombia under an
extensive plan to create collective panic and insecurity
in both countries. Colombian military authorities
have reportedly é@rawn up a plan to prevent terrorism
iu Colombia's cities.

1, Although our public’ po.

enalysis is offered on the assumption that some change in emphasis is

both possible and desirable, now or st some time in the future.

b, But let us be clear that tvo kinds of subversion ere involved:

(1) Hardwere-centered - thet is, funds, guns, tools of

3, How much does this fact of inevitable subversion raise the prob-

ability of Commnism spreading to target countries?

not a necessary one, . saints

Usually it is infeasible to do so or the costs are prohibitive.

For instence, the costs of a protracted tight quarantine which

ee One consequence of this line of reasoning would be that,

ete if we ever find it necessary to invede Cuba, we'should do so "to stop

CONCLUSIONS

» 1, Conditions in most parts of Ix

n America are such that sub-

version (Cuban or Bloc or both) is really dangerous.

2. ince this is so, the US public posture should not recognize

this; and we should abstain from public pronouncements that subversion
is conceivably a casus belli.
3. The point-of-view set forth in this paper, Insofar as it can

be made operative, may tend to bring a fundamental alignment between the

“4, Dhe US course of action towards ‘eny LA country has to weigh the
advantages end disadvantages, in any given case at any given tire, of
