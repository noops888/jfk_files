conversation took place in the
whom Owen had met threugh a neighbor, Lioyd FURR.

The memorandum relates CASSAGNOL's background, family,

” political stance, etc. Reported as significant by Owen ie a

statement by BAST that the following week BAST would be
sending a shipload of arms to a CASSAGNOL~affiltated greup
in the Dominican Republic. Owen noted: “Raymond
CASSAGNOL gives appearance of thinking well of Richard
BAST. According to CASSAGNOL, a OE eat
also knowa BAST and respects him, Thus BAST, in spite
certain personal shertcomings from the intelligence standpoint,
does represent an established channel to at least one segment
of the Haitian opposition to Duvalier. Since according to his
own statement, BAST ts supplying arms te CASSAGNOL's
groups, further transactions of this type via BAST presumably
would not be difficult to arrange." He also provided @ detailed
information on what he learned of BAST, noting thet BAST had
mentioned Dominican distrust of State and AED and the fact that
"CIA double-crossed them" (the Dominicans).

An FRI report on BAST dated 19 June 1963 reports that Owen,

Lais MORENO Martines of the Dominican Republic to prepare

40% of the stock was to be held by the head of the DR National
