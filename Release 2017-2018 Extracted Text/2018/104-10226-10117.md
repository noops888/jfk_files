Judging by the attached mterial, It would appear that, despite

establisbed Bell policy (see our 16 May memorandum re Case 39,790), the

opponition has seen fit to deflower at least tro of Bell's scientifie

wrens. Te seriourly wonder at this point juat hon many other 3el

people might be in the inne boat. Perhaps, an a result of all thie,

mone representation by Bell magement to the KGB will be fortheoming,

apolling out to that organisation, as vas spelled out to our om, estab

lined company palley pertaining to such mtters. In any eveut, It would

appear that at least one or two Bell scientists, and there are probably

more, have been siring the R.I.S, more cooperation and reporting than the

concy. Let'a hope that 1n the near future Bell managenent takes som

flective steps to rectify this rather ludierous, and patently dangerous
