1954 :

OLTMANS questioned by the Amsterdam police on the charge
of having had homosexual relations with a minor. The case was
dismissed for lack of evidence.

{FBI Memorandum, 30 March 1962.]

August 1954 - November 1955:

[FBI FR (New Haven), 15 January 1962 - DBF 99933.]

OLTMANS' former wife, Freida (now married to Peter BIE-
LING), claimed she had met OLTMANS while she was on vacation in
Holland. He claimed he was employed as a reporter for the United
Press in Amsterdam. She later determined that he was a teletype
operator. She claimed that shortly after he was fired from this
job and he began to work as a free-lance writer.

About September 1954 :

In about September 1954, H. J. 0. Van HAAGEN, of Amster-

dam, lodged a complaint to the effect that OLTMANS had SETA

SECRET (Aor



committed acts of lewdness with-his (complainant's) under-age
son during the summer of 1954, Inquiries into the matter failed
to reveal any evidence of any offense having been committed.

When interrogated, and also when being confronted with
each other, both the persons concerned denied any act of lewdness
having taken place between them. There was, however, evidence that
OLTMANS' conduct: toward the boy had been somewhat strange, which
caused the latter to discontinue his association with OLTMANS.

As there was no evidence of any homosexual relations
having existed between the persons concerned, the Chief Commissio-
ner of Police, Amsterdam, was of the opinion that the matter should
not incriminate OLTMANS and should not be used in deportation pro-
ceedings against him.

{FBI FR (New York), 11 March 1963 - DBA 35747.)

1956 og :

As correspondent’ for De Nieuwsgier, OLTMANS covered the
visit to Indonesia-of the Soviet Chief of State, VOROSHILOV. At
several mass meetings the Russian President severly censored The
Netherlands,. he pleaded for the immediate transfer of New Guinea
to Indonesia, and posing as the great supporter of the young state,
he in this way assured the Communist Party of a resounding election
victory not long after. As.a result the relations between Indonesia
and The Netherlands deteriorated considerably.

[Haagse Post, 15 April 1961.]

Early 1956 :

OLTMANS learned that SUKARNO planned to pay a visit to
Italy and he asked his papers whether they would be interested in

an exclusive interview. The response was negative. At the same
time, however, OLTMANS contacted the Agence France Presse which en-
gaged OLTMANS, at a daily fee of some 30 guilders, to cover SUKARNO's
visit to Rome. The then 32-years old OLTMANS contacted SUKARNO. dur-
ing a reception at the Indonesian Embassy, and he managed to inter-
view SUKARNO. This interview made a great hit with the AFP which
asked OLTMANS to cover SUKARNO's trip through Italy.

In those days, OLTMANS got the firm conviction that he had

SEGEE


to fulfill a mission: a new formulated meeting of the interests of
The Netherlands and Indonesia. He wanted to go to Djakarta to make
a thorough study of the-problems and after paying a number of visits
he secured financial aid (10,000 guilders) of some six Netherlands
enterprises with interests in Indonesia. Moreover, he entergd into
arrangements with some papers, for which he could write articles as
their foreign correspondent

in Djakarta, he soon met numerous Dutchmen, including
Professor P,.N. DROST (who after having served in 1950 for one year
with the United Nations Human Rights Division, discontinued his ser-
vice because of unsatisfactory cooperation). During a visit which
he paid to DROST, OLTMANS discussed with him the position of the
Dutch in Indonesia, their dissatisfaction with the policy pursued
in The Hague, their desire to emerge from the Indonesian-Netherlands
impasse and'in this connection also the New Guinea issue. He made
the suggestion of expressing all these desires in an address to the
States General; Professor DROST himself was enthusiastic over it,
and that very evening, he drafted an address which was stenciled
with the. cooperation of.a Dutch enterprise in Djakarta, and within
some days was signed by 300 Dutch nationals. -

The address, which invited Parliament to set talks with
Indonesia going again and to assume a more accommodating attitude
towards SUKARNO because otherwise sharp measures were to be expec-
ted against Dutch nationals and interests in Indonesia, was used by
the Indonesian representative to the United Nations to weaken the
official arguments. In The Netherlands press a storm was raised
against the signatories to the address and especially against the
journalist OLTMANS who was cited by DROST as the initiator. The
papers for which he acted as foreign correspondent terminated the

contracts.

[Haagse Post, 15 April 1961.]

1956 2

OLTMANS claimed during an open session before the Senate
Subcommittee, on-30 November. 1962, that he interviewed SUKARNO in
Role, although the editor of De Telegraaf, the leading Dutch news-

paper, forbade OLTMANS to interview President SUKARNO.



"In order to verify my impressions, I went to Indonesia
for the first time in my life for the Nieuwe Rotterdamse Courant,
that is the Times of The Netherlands, and I stayed there until
1956 and 1957, and I made many trips throughout the country, and I
got to know President SUKARNO intimarely, and I am now writing a>
book on him, the first book ever written on SUKARNO". .

[Hearing. before Senate Subcommittee, 30 November 1962, p. 42.]

May 1956 . E

Inasmuch as OLTMANS had not been very successful in his
writings’in Holland, he went to Rome where he was able to wangle an
invitation to a reception for SUKARNO at the Indonesian Embassy. He
then contacted the representative of a leading French newspaper and
offered to do a’story on SUKARNO for that newspaper. This offer
was accepted, ‘and-OLTMANS subsequently attended the reception for
SUKARNO, where he presented SUKARNO with a silver ash tray. Appar-
ently through this meeting and subsequent meetings SUKARNO permitted
him to travel-with the press entourage from Indonesia which was tra-
veling with SUKARNO.’ He later became the onty Western newspaperman
who traveled with the SUKARNO party as it made its way around Europe
on state visits and this travel included a visit to Yugoslavia. He
was unable to gotto. the USSR as he was unable to obtain a visa and ~~
to get a seat on the airplane. Frieda BIELING stated that despite the
cordiality of Indonesian newspapermen toward OLTMANS there was a
certain amount of jealousy exhibited by these newsmen because of
OLTMANS' close personal contact with SUKARNO.

[FBI FR (New York), 1 February 1962 - DBA 796.]

OLTMANS subsequently returned to Holland where he started
to contact various Dutch industrial corporations whose holdings in
Indonesia had been seized or were in jeopardy of being seized by the
Indonesian Government. He was able to convince some of these indus-
trialists, particularly a Mr. REINKENS, the President of Unilever,
that because of his close relationship with SUKARNO he would be able
to arbitrate between the industrial empires and the Indonesian
Governient for adequate compensation for their properties. In addi.
tion, he had also made arrangements with the Amsterdam newspaper

Elsevier to furnish them with several articles concerning Indonesia

SESRET


and, according to Mrs. BIELING, did have two or three articles
published from Indonesia.

[Ibid.]

December 1956 i
OLTMANS went to Indonesia. Shortly after his arrival
there, he published the so-called "appeal of Netherlanders in
Indonesia ‘to The Netherlands States General" to reconsider its a
attitude on Netherlands New Guinea. The signatures under this
appeal were collected through the intermediary of the Nieuwsgier,
a Dutch language newspaper now, according to sourc e, completely
in Indonesian hands and assumed to be indirectly controlled. by
the Indonesian Government
[CSCI-3/748,549 4 February 1958 (from a report dated 12 February

February 1957

OLTMANS' efforts to bring about some type of rapproche-
ment between the industrialists and the Indonesian Government ap-
parently failed and in February 1957, at which time Frieda BIELING
was in the United States, she received a telegram stating he was
coming to the United Nations to do press work for the Indonesian
Government. At the time he arrived, the whole question of Dutch
control .of New Guinea was being-brought before-the United Nations
and she presumed that this was the reason for his arrival in the.
United States.

19 February 1957

OLTMANS married Frieda WESTERMAN.

According to her, her marriage to OLTMANS was not a normal

relationship, e.g., he was constantly traveling and had left the
United States less than a month after their marriage. On theday
of their marriage, ten minutes after the ceremony, he had left her
and she was walking through Greenwich Village in New York City by
herself.

At one time her father had determined that OLTMANS had a
police record for molesting young boys in Amsterdam, Holland, and
that he had been under psychiatric care with his uncle, a well-known
Dutch psychiatrist, for homosexuality. Subsequently, by chance, she
read a diary which he maintained, which gave a detailed account of
his daily life, in addition to his homosexual activities; she stated
that this convinced her that she must obtain a divorce.

[FBI FR (New York),-1 February 1962 - DBA 796.]

September 1957 a

OLTMANS traveled to The Netherlands. After paying a
number of visits to prominent Dutch politicians and industrialists,
during which.he pleaded for talks on Irian (Netherlands New Guinea)
between ‘the two countries, he rented a reception hall in the Hotel
de Witteberg, and organized a meeting of some well-known members of
Parliament, of the Council of State, industrialists, and financiers

This meeting actually took place on 16 October 1957. OLT-
MANS opened the meeting and warned about an impending Irian action
unless early talks were initiated with the Indonesians. At the con-
clusion of the meeting OLTMANS received 1500 guilders to cover expen-
ses (which actually amounted to 900 guilders).

1959

According to an article appearing in Haagse Post on 15
April 1961 (an independent weekend publication with a nationwide |
readership), "Leading figures of Netherlands trade and industry
had a secret. arrangement with President SUKARNO two years ago in
Rome to talk. with him about Netherlands assets in Indonesia. How-
ever, they waited in vain in the Italian capital for several weeks;
in spite of a clear arrangement made via a Dutch journalist, SUKARNO
failed to turn up.

"His name is only known to few in The Netherlands - the
young: Dutch reporter who, an intimate friend of SUKARNO, for five
long years has been trying to lay contacts between the Indonesian
Chief of State, Netherlands captains of industry. and Netherlands

Headquarters reports to the Federal Bureau of Investi-

attached" and "Unsponsoréd", travelling alone and without any
specific prearranged itinerary.

tions unanswered. He is socially ostracized by the Dutch de-
legation and fellow Dutch newsmen at the United Nations for
his openly pro-Indonesian public stand inthe question of
Dutch: Guines.

He isnot permanently accredited to the United Nations.
Ostensibly -he works for an obscure Dutch monthly magazine but
fellow Dutch correspondents say they have. yet to see one story.

grew up in Indonesia and therefore knows the conditions there.

printed anywhere, OLTMANS travels extensively.“ He shuttles be-
tween Europe and the United States quite regularly (at least
once a year), was in the Congo last year, recently returned

"What is activating Willem OLTMANS whose spirit made

"The fact that he is continually hard up for cash is
an argument against this assumption. When he is in The Nether-
lands he is in the habit of getting free rides from city to
city. His many air trips were made ‘possible by the fact that
he is.married toa ground stewardess of an American aviation
company and consequently can travel virtually free of charge.
In recent. years he is making his living by means of lectures
throughout the United States in behalf of the "lecture office

can public opinion with regard to New Guinea. He himself says
‘Whatever I. do, write or say - my only objective is to see
Dutch prestige restored in Indonesia’. But his presence, his -
knowledge of ‘Indonesian politics and politicians, his connec-
tions with Dutch trade and industry cannot be argued away. No
less than the fact that. when LUNS carried on talks in Washington,
Kennedy appeared to be very wéll informed about the divergent :
views of a number of Dutch politicians, financiers, and indus-

OLTMANS presented a one-hour exclusive interview with
Jim GARRISON, New Orleans District Attorney, on Dutch television,
at prime-time on 22 February 1968.

GARRISON explained that President. KENNEDY was murdered
because his concept of detente was detrimental to the "military-
industrial complex". He repeated well-known thesis that KENNEDY
was a victim of a plot by CIA, who made common cause with the
military-industrial establishment, with vested interest in keeping
the cold war going. GARRISON also stated CIA committed to the
Asian-land war while one of President's last orders was for troop
reduction there. He predicted that the President who brings the
United States to the brink of pence will suffer same fate as
KENNEDY. ;

When queried about the reason the program, especially
made for a European audience, GARRISON said the growing CIA in-
fluence on United States media made it impossible for him to be
heard in his own country. ! .

OLTMANS, said to be ‘a‘Wnited States citizen, is charac-
terized by his former colleagues as someone. "more interested in

shady politics than in journalism".

Author's comment:. The most damaging. aspect of this pros-

credible to.elicit rather favorable comment in. the ‘TV reviews
from such generally well-informed newspapers as Nieuwe Rotter-

damse Courant, among others,- Several Dutch viewers also commen-

ted on the credibility of his person and presentation. Likely
that Dutch television will.try to sell this program to other
European stations.

The papet said that OLTMANS had talks last night at his home in

Amsterdam "with a number of left-wing personalities. on such sub

jects:.as' NATO and LUNS". The report added that three represen-
tatives of the Soviet Embassy in The Hague, the Political,
Cultural, and Press Attaches were also present.

Their. behavior indicates a rather obtrusive interference ;

with Dutch affairs and Hague circles say it is certainly unu-

sual, the paper said.

De Telegraaf said Hague circles pointed out that the Russians
would be very interested in discrediting the new and active Secre-
tary General of NATO. In that function LUNS has already displayed
great energy in the way he has tackled the Malta problem, which
was threatening to be lost to NATO.

|The surprising presence of the three Soviet diplomats _

in OLTMANS' house last night indicates possible Soviet attempts
to exert influence in the current campaign against the person
of the Secretary-General of NATO. The paper added that it was
too much of a coincidence that the three Russians called on
OLTMANS just before he is due to give his press conference in
The Hague tomorrow morning.

(OLTMANS has announced that he had cabled LUNS asking him
to attend the press conference so that he:couls accuse him pub-,
licly of "misleading" the Government and (former) President
SUKARNO of Indonesia. LUNS is due in Holland anyway tomorrow to
join other prominent KLM guests for its inaugural flight to Hong
Kong.)

"The report is a barefaced lie and a libel on the

A Dutch journalist said he testified [for second time}
under oath [in a close hearing] that a Russian emigrant who ap-..’
parently committed suicide earlier this week had claimed to be
part of a-conspiracy to kill President: Kennedy.

The television newsman, Willem OLTMANS, said George de
MOHRENSCHILDT told him the alleged conspiracy involved Texas
oilmen, Cuban exiles, and CIA and FBI agents.

OLTMANS said de MOHRENSCHILDT claimed he was-a middle-
man between H. L. HUNT representing. Texas oilmen and Lee Harvey
OSWALD. The journalist said he gave the committee: “the name of
an FBI official, not [J. Edgar] HOOVER, who might be important.

The Dutch journalist said de MOHRENSCHILDT told him
Cubans had fired at Kennedy at the same time OSWALD did and
said he gave the House Assassinations Committee the name and
picture of one Cuban he believes was involved. -

OLTMANS, who testified’ for more than three hours in a
closed sessions of the House panel investigating the Kennedy

assassination, later declined to tell reporters what evidence

he had to support the claim.

He said he gave the committee a taped interview in
which .a Cuban.exile named Loran HALL claims he was ‘offered
$50,000-in the office of ilman Lester LOGUE to kill Kennedy.

In Dallas, LOGUE called the allegation."ridiculous"
and said-he would meet with his‘gawyers.to discuss swing. OLTMANS
for libel.

After OLTMANS testified, reporters asked subcommittee
chairman Richard PREYER (D-N.C.) if he believed the story. "Ask :
me that question again in a few months", PREYER replied, "Mr.
OLTMANS. was very specific.on some things which can be‘ corroborated
but not ‘as clear on others".

The journalist said in at least two news interviews
before his committee appearance yesterday. that de MOHRENSCHILDT
wavered between “insisting the whole story was true and indicating

“he made it up to sefl a book. But OLTMANS who is said to be wri-
ting a book on the assassination himself, told reporters after

his. testimony that de MOHRENSCHILDT never told him he had made the _
story up. : :

OLTMANS said de MOHRENSCHILDT mixed ‘socially with Dallas
oilmen and other wealthy people and became a friend of HUNT a
multimillionaire oilman now dead.

"What. Mr. de MOHRENSCHILDT said was. that Mr. OSWALD was
acting at his guidance and instructions", OLTMANS said in-an ABC
interview. "Mr. de MOHRENSCHILDT indicated that his ties up-
wards were towards H. L. HUNT . . . and downstairs to Lee Harvey
OSWALD". i"

of a Cuban veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba who was

3 April 1977 (date of newspaper article):

In still another dubious excursion, the committee has
now labeled a man who not long ago emerged from A psychiatric
ward, George de MOHRENSCHILDT, as a “crucial witness" although
he had just committed suicide. Neither the Assassinations. Com- i
mittee nor its staff ever interviewed the man, a White Russian
who had befriended the OSWALDs in Texas in 1962.
In fact, House investigators’ possess: little more than. :

a Dutch. television film tape and one tape cassette "allegedly"

containing a conversation between de MOHRENSCHILDT and Dutch
journalist Willen OLTMANS.

In a spate of interviews since de MOHRENSCHILDT's
death Tuesday afternoon, OLTMANS has been quoting him as saying

he was a middleman between Texas oilmen and OSWALD in a baroque. -

kill-Kennedy conspiracy, which also seems to have included: anti-
Castro Cubans anda trucking firm executive.

Curiously, by OLTMANS' account, ‘de MOHRENSCHILDT: did
not come up with the story until February -.more than 13 years
after the assassination but only a few. weeks after his release
December 30 from the psychiatric unit of Parkland Memorial Hos-
pital. And although OLTMANS quotes de MOHRENSCHILDT as saying
OSWALD took instructions from him, that is somewhat difficult to
square with the fact that the de MOHRENSCHILDTs were in Haiti
at the time of the Kennedy assassination and had been there for
about five months. They told the Warren Commission they last
saw the OSWALDs in April of 1963 and, the Commission found, *
“they never saw either of the OSWALDs again".
