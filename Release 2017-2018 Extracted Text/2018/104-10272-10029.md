House Investigators, however, have
challenged the Justice Department's
findings. In a confidential, 16-page
ani they have pointed out signifi-

tend that they have solved the casc.
But they have set forth their clues in a
fascinating secret report, stamped
“Sensitive.” Here are the highlights in
chronological order:

© While Ray was serving time in the
Missouri state penitentiary, he told cel-
Imates that he would kill King “if the
price was right.” Ray also was quoted.
- as saying he intended to seek out a
“businessmen’s association” which al-
legedly had offered $100,000 for King’ 's
murder.

from the prison by hiding in a large
bread box, which was loaded on a bak-

as Eric Galt, Ramon George Sneyd,

“These allases correspond to the
names of real men, all ot whom lived
close to one another in suburban To-
ronto,” report the investigators, "In ad-
dition, three out of the four bear phys-

. deal resemblances to Ray.” Galt “even

had scars in the same location as did
Ray, the forehead and right palm.”
The’ House sleuths want to know
“whether Ray recelved any help In ob-
Aaining these aliases.”

© For the next Phat Ray “traveled

estimates that he spent at least $9,500.”
Those who did business with him re-
call that “he often paid for Items with

JFIK Data Quashed, Memo Says _

A confidential House memo accuses
the FBI and CIA of “a serious suppres-
sion of evidence which was vital to this
country’s investigation” of the 1963 as-
sassination of President Kennedy.

A House Assassinations subcommit-
tee “has uncovered a good deal of in-
formation which suggests that Lee
Harvey Oswald was associated with
one or both of these erganizations,”
the memo says.

the Havana underworld, controlled by
mobster Santos Trafficante, were used
in the plot against the Cuban premier.
‘The mobster who directed the.attempt
on Castro's life, John Roselli, hinted
privately that tho same killers had
been caught by Castro and had been
turned against Kennedy. Interestingly
enough, a Cuban exile, according to
the memo, quoted Trafficante as say-
Ing “that Kennedy was going to be

and FBI intentionally withheld rele-
vant Information from the Warren
Commission and In at least one in-
stance, provided the commission with
information known to be false.”

The memo accuses the FBI of with-
holding 23 Oswald files from the com-
mission. The FBI “was in possession of
69 pre-assassination files on Lee Har-
vey Oswald,” states the memo. “How-

-ever, of these files, only 46 were

turned over to the commission.”

The information that allegedly was
withheld was contradictory. On one
hand, the CIA suppressed facts sugg-
esting that Cuba's Fidel Castro may
have retaliated against President Ken-
nedy after learning about the CIA's
plot against his own life. But on the
other hand, the CIA allegedly covered
up evidence linking Oswald to CIA-
sponsored, anti-Castro Cubans.

The House memo draws no conclu-
sion about the Kennedy killing. But it
lays out the evidence that the commit-
tee has gathered thus far. Here are the
highlights:

* The CIA did not disclose to the
Warren Commission that it had been
trying to knock off Fidel Castro at the
time Kennedy was shot. Killers from

¢ Roselli had also sugested that the
mob had ordered Jack Ruby to kill Os-
wald to prevent any disclosure of the
‘Trafficante connection. One of Ruby's
underworld associates, the memo re-
ports, “Indicates that In 1959 Jack
Ruby traveled to Cuba and visited
Santos Trafficante in jail.” The same
source also reported that “Ruby and
Rosell] had meetings in Miami several
months prior to the assassination.”

¢ A witness had told committee in-
vestigators that Ruby introduced ‘her
to Oswald at a Dallas nightclub two
weeks before the assassination. She
“had been afraid to come forth with
her Information,” according to the
memo, because another woman disap-
peared after she mentioned seeing Os-
wald at Ruby’s nightclub. But the long
silent witness “Is now willing to tes-
tify.”

© The Warren Commission met be-
hind closed doors on Jan. 27, 1964, to
discuss “evidence” that Oswald had
been a $200-a-month FBI informant up
to the lime of the assassination. The
evidence came from two “Iindepen-
dent” and “rellable” sources, The com-

bans told her that the American was,
trying to persuade antlCastro groups*
“to kill President Kennedy because of.

"Tack Anderson and Les Whitten
Odd CIA Activity in Dallas in 1963 —

The secret files of the House Assas-

sinations Committee contain reports of
Strange CIA activities in Dallas on the
eve of the John F. Kennedy assassina-
ton. .
Credible witnesses have confirmed
our past reports that the accused assas-
sin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was in touch
with antl-Castro Cubans In Dallas. One
confidential report states that “in 1963,
Oswald was seen leaving the Dallas of-
fice of Alpha 66.” This was a Cuban
commando group trained by the CLA,

A Cuban CIA operative, Antonio Ve-
clana, also told investigators that he
had been summoned to Dallas in Au-
gust 1969, by his CLA contact—a myste-

ricus man who went by the name of :

Morris Bishop. States a confidential
summary: “When (Veciana) arrived,
Bishop was-accompanted by another
maa, Lee Harvey Oswald.” .

Another witness who impressed the
investigators, Sylvia Odio, told them
that two antiCastro Cubans had Intro-
duced her to an American by the name
of Leon Oswald. She was told that Os-
wald was trying “to convince antl-
Castco Cuban groups. . .to kill Presi
dent Kennedy.” After the assassina-
‘lon, she recognized this American as
Lee Harvey Oswald.

‘The House investigators don't really
believe that the CIA had any part In
ibe murder of President Kennedy.
More likely, they suspect the CLA may
have trled to cover up some embar-
rassing contacts with Oswald in Dallas.

In any case, the CIA took pains to
give the Impression that Oswaid was in
Mexico City at the time that witnesses
claimed be was dealing with the CLA-
guided Cubans In Dallas. Veciana, for
exainple, told of a strange call he re-

celved from his CIA contact alter Ken-
nedy was killed.

The CIA man, Morris Bishop, asked
Veclana to contact his cousin, Buil-
Jamo Rulez, who worked for the Cuban
embassy In Mexico City. Relates a con-
{idential report: “Veclana was to relay
Bishop's offer to pay Rulez and his
wife to say that they had met with Os-
wald in Mexico City.”

This not only would have placed Os-
wald out of Dallas but would have
thrown suspicion on the Castro gov-
ernment. The ruse was later called off.
Instead, the CLA cited secret tapes and
photographs as evidence that Oswald

ad been in touch with both the Cuban
and Soviet embassies in Mexico City.

‘The CIA kept tapes of all phone caiis

~going in and out of the two embassies.
Photographs were also taken of every-
one entering and leaving these embas-

“sles. On Oct. 1, 1963, the CJA notified
other U.S. embassies that “an Ameri-
can male, who identified himself as
Lee Oswald, contacted the Soviet Em-
bassy in Mexico City.” :

Oswald was described In the cable a3
“approximately 35 years old, with an
athletic build, about six feet tall, with
a receding hairline.” The committee
files note that this “In no way phys!
cally resembles the Lee Harvey Os-

. wald accused of assassinating Presi
dent Kennedy.” : neon

The CIA sought photographs from

the navy to compare with its pho-
tographs of Oswald at the Soviet em-
bassy. Declares a committee report:
"These photographs, though obviously
not of the correct Lee lirvey Oswald,
became the Warren Commission's ex-
hibit 237, The CIA admitted that there

had been a mix-up but never cleared
the matter up." ?

A CIA witness has told committee In-
vestigators, neanwhile, that the CIA’s
monitoring camera happened to break
down on the day that Oswald allegedly
visited the Soviet Embassy. But the
CIA tap on the Soviet Embassy's phone
produced an alleged telephone call
from someone who Identified himself
as “Lee Henry Oswald.”

The CIA witness claimed that the ac-
tual voice recording of the telephons
conversation “was destroyed in rou-
Une destruction procedures approxi-
mately one week after ft was re-
ceived.” Yet more than seven weeks
later, the FBI claimed to have heard
the telephone conversation that the
CIA sald had been destroyed. ‘The
FBI's judgment was that the voice dd
not belong to Oswald.

Wrote the late FBI director J. Edgar
Hoover on Nov. 23, 1063: "The Central
Intelligence Agency advised that on
Oct. 1, 1963, an extremely sensitive
source had reported that an Individual
Indenti(ied himself as Lee Oswald,
who contacted the Soviet Embassy In
Mexico City Inquiring as to any messa-

ges.
“Special agents of thls bureau, who
have conversed with Oswald in Dallas,
Tex., have observed pbotographs of
the Individual referred to above and
have listened to a recording of bis
volce. These speclal ‘agents are of the
opinion that the above-referred-to in-
dividual was not Lee Harvey Oswald”

‘This stirred the ICC’s new boss, A.
Daniel O'Neal, to seek a peace confer-
ence with the Justice Department's
acting antitrust chief, John Shene-
field, They sat down together behind
closed doors, each attended by aldes.

An O'Neal aide asked the antitrust

officials, please, to stop Issuing “cheap- _

shot press releases” against the ICC.
O'Neal put it more delicately: with ap-
parent sincerity, be offered to incorpo-

rate more antitrust philosophy Into

ICCdecisions. . °.,

By all accounts, the trustbusters
were so overcome by O'Neal's coopera-
tive attitude that they rushed out and
reversed an earlier decision to chal-
lenge another ICC ruling.

‘This was a ruling to deny a small bus
company; Latin Express Service, the
right to provide limited service be-
tween Miami, Fla., and Union City, N.J.
‘The company wanted to serve Spanish-
speaking travelers who have difficulty
on Greybound and Trailways buses,

Latin Express, for example, would,

have‘ provided bilingual drivers and
food with a Spanish flavor. Yet ICC de-
nied the little company permission to .
run only two or three roundtrips a
week. The ICC ruling, Incredibly, |
claimed this timited’ service might
harm the busing giants, Greyhound
and Trallways.
. The Antritrust Division, which Is
“supposed to encourage competition, -
objected to the ridiculous ruling. One
fuming antitrust official called it “so
outrageous as to boggle the mind.” It
was absurd, he said, “to think Latin
Express could have diverted enough
revenue from Greyhound or  Trail-
ways” to endanger them.
‘The Antitrust Division, therefore,
decided to challenge the ICC decision, -
and another sharp statement was star-

ted through the bureaucratic machin- +

ery. But then the trustbusters, basking

in the warm glow of their mecting -

with O'Neal, changed their, minds
‘about the Lalin Express case. .

A spokesman acknowledged, quite
candidly, that the antitrust chiefs
didn’t want to attack the ICC so soon

after the truce with O'Neal. So the
spirit of detente prevailed. «+ it»

Unfortunately for O'Neal's sensibilt-
ties, however, the top trustbusters for-
-got to tell the press office, about their
change of heart. The unwitting press
office, therefore, Issued another bils- +
tering relcase. eh ot,

“For the second time In two
Months,” declared the embarrassing
relcase, “the Department of Justice

. has challenged an ICC decision deny-
ing a small bus company authority to
provide new intercily service.” al

The release quotes the antitrust
chief, Joe Sims, as proclaiming: “The

commission's decision points up the
impossible burden placed on new ap-
plicants for motor carrier operating
authority by the ICC, even when the
proposed service Is highly specialized
and the applicantis very small.” **
The only trouble with the press re-
. Tease was that the ICC ruling was not
challenged as advertised and the deci-
ston to drop the challenge was made
by Joe Sims. =. . - Ee

Waller noted that Blakey, House Select Committee on Assassinations

Oswald before the Kennedy assassination and later tried to cover up that con-

FBI Documents on JFK Killing Raise

thd assassination of Johti F. Kennedy
ralfe, but do not answer, questions
abbut.Lee Harvey Oswald's move-+
mepts in the days before Dallas, and
about the source of the bullets that
Killed the President.

The 597 pages of documents are the

Ac} for its material on the investiga.
Lich vf of Kennedy's death In Dallas on

he first three volumes were pro-
vided to a private researcher several .

. Months ago and were made available

yesterday to the Associated Press.

‘The ducuments, many heavily cen-
sored, show that the FBI attempted
to trace the fatal bullets from the
time they were manufactured until
they reached the assassin's hands,

Agents initially were perplexed by
a piece of evidence they found.

The bullets were 6.5-milllmetcr
Mannlicher-Carcano ammunition.
Agents determined that the manufac-
turer was Ute Western Cartridge Corp.
of East Alton, 11.

Agents in Illinois examined the
company's production records and
found that the firm produced 4 million
rounds of this type of ammunition for

the U.S, Marine Corps in 1954.

“Phe interesting thing about this
order is that it Js for ammunition
which does not fit and cannot be
fired in any of the USMC weapons.”
said an FBI memo dated Dec. 2, 1963.

“This gives rise to the obvious spec-
ulation that it Js a contract for am-
munition placed by CLA with Western
under a USMC cover for concealment
purposes," the memo continued.

In other words, FBI officials spec-
ulated that the CIA was using the
Marine Corps as a cover to purchase
ammunition in secret.

A’ memo written at FBI headquar.
ters the next day noted that the
George Zucker Sales Co. of Chicago
had purchased about 2 million round:
for commercial resale In 1962.

in the: first batch of files released.
these were the only two memos deal
ing with the ammunition, The materi
al said nothing more to explain or
resulve the agents’ spectlation. Nor
was Jt known whether the files to br
released next week, and another 40.
00 pages duc later, would shed more
light on the question.

‘The Warten Commission investizal
ed the assassination and concluded
that Oswald, acting alone, killed
Kennedy. The commission reported
that this type of ammunition “is
readily available for purchase from
mail order houses as well as a fev
gun shops.” It noted that “some ”
inition rounds have been placed on
sale In the United States.”

The records showed that the FBI
kept close watch and a volumino:
file on Oswald from his defection te
the Soviet Unlon in October, 395°.
and after he returned to the United
Stales in June, 1962,

But the bureau lost track of hin:
for several weeks in September anil
October, 1963, and agents in Dallas.
Litlle Rock and New Orleans were
put on alert to locate him and his
Russian-born wife, Marina.
