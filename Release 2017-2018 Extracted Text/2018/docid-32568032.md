LOSCOW.

At this hotel one orders coffee at a serving bar, then

carries it to any available table.

On this occasion, JONes was

occupying a table where Dr. McDANIEL found an empty seat.

le described JONIS as about 28-30 years old; slender

face, and large prominent mouth. JOkS has a really out-going,

bubbling personality. He introduced himself and told Dr.

MCDANIEL that he was an Amorican citizen and lived in lavana,

Cuba. Dr• McDANIEL became interested then and talked with JONES

for about an hous, starting at 11 P-".,September 4,1963• 3ONRS

said that he had not finished his education and wanted to zeturn

to the United States to do so. Although Dr. MCDANIEL, cannot

recall the verbatin conversation, there is no question in his

mind that JONS was sympathetic to communism. He asked if JONES

was a momber of the Communist Party. JONES said he was not a

member but was fully sympathetic with the aims and goals of the

communist novenent.

This was almost an exact quote of JONES'

response, to Dr. McDANIAL's recollection.

JONES did not say why he was in Moscow.

However, he

was greeted by a number of Spanish speaking people, mostly wonen,

who treated him with some deference as if he were a guide of

sone sort for a tour. This, however, was only an impression of

Dr. MCDANIL's and he had no conversation with JONES to verify

1t. Dr. MCDANIEL did not see JONES* wife in Moscow and had the

impression that she was a psychologist like him.

JONES said he went to Cuba on vacation about the time

of the revolution in Cuba,

Do considers CASTRO a great man who

has done so much for the Cubans that they can never repay hin.

JONES described CASTRO as a humanitarian who does not like

violence.

"When Dr. lcDANIEL asked him about the executions by

CASTRO, JONES defended CASTRO and explained the executions in

this way:

during the revolution when the citizens of Cuba

caught followers of BATISTA, CASTRO told them not to take the

law

into their own hands but to let the revolution handle

these people. If CASTRO had not done this, thousands would

have been killed.

Then, although CASTRO did not like to do it,

he had to execute some

to fulfill his promise to the people.

JONGS was aware of Dr. McDANIEL's position with the

United States government.

When asked if he did not think he

was in trouble with the State Department over his travel to Cuba,

he said he was sure he was.

He said that he expected to have

serious trouble, but said this would be on the conscience of the

united States government and not on bis. He made several very

derogatory remarks about the United States Department of State

and the United states government generally.

These remarks

alleged that the United States government lied about Cuba,

and

about atrocities there and took military steps against Cuba.

JONES said that in Cuba, he was working for a lady

about thirty-seven years old.

he said he is a psychologist.

His boss there in. Cuba is a fine woman dedicated to the revolution.

JONES said he found it a wonderful opportunity. He has a free

reign to conduct researches,

Dr. MCDANIEL asked him why so many people left Cuba.

JONES said the BATISTA government had a large number of exploiters.

They knew no other life,

they ran Cuba. They were intelligent

and

important. In the new socialist order they just did not fit

and they left,

Jones said his was for the betterment of the Cuban

system. He expected the revolution to be a complete success and

does not expect many of these people to ever return to Cuba.

JONES said he does not have a passport.

He did not say

how he left the United States or how he

traveled to Cuba, other

than to say he went there on a vacation.

Dr, MCDANIEL asked JONGS how he explained having three

servants during this revolution. He explained the servants by

saying that this was a transition period in the revolution.

JONES contended that communis in
