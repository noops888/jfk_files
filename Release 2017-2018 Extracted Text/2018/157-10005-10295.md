for "covert action."' Covert action is secret action.~

to influence events in foreign countries which is so designed
that, if discovered, official U.S. government participation

( actions? This paper is one of a series that will attempt to
answer.the question, it will first examine the predecessor

agencies to the CIA in order that the establishment of the

CIA may be placed in historical perspective. Next, it will

set out the legislative history of the National Security Act

of 1947, the basic charter of the CIA, and the National
Security Council directives which instructed the CIA to con-
duct various forms of covert action. Finally, it will present
au legal analysis of the 1947 Act. Other papers in the series
will cxamine the impact on the CIA's authority to conduct
covert action of Congressional provision of funds of the CIA,
