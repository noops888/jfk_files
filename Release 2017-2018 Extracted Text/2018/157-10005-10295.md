¡for "covert action." Covert action is socret action.

to influence events in foreign countries which is so designed

that, is discoverod, official U.S. government participation

What is the legal authority for the CIA to conduct covert

actions? This paper is one of a scries that will attempt to

ansiver. the question. It will first examine the predecessor

agencies to the CIA in order that the establishment of the

CIA may be placed in historical perspective. Noxt, it will

set out the legislative history of the National Security Act

of 1947, the basic charter of the CIA, and the National

Security Council directives which instructed the CIA to con-

auct various forms of covert action. Finally, it will present

i legal analysis of the 1947 Act. Other papers in the series

will examine the impact on the CiA's authority to conduct

covèrt action of Congressional provision of funds of the CiA,
