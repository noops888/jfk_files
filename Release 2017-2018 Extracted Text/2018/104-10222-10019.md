Beginning with

his arrival in the WAVE area in October 1960, €

Seinitiated

an operational program directed to the establishment of a

Cuban intelligence service, both for positive collection of

intelligence and to establish protective security on JMATE

operations.

In a remarkably short time altasswas able to

recruit, train, and organize such a service which has

effectively responded to intelligence and counter intelli

gence operational tasks, and has shown willingness and

ability to ably perform a number of support functions for

other types of substantive operations, principally para

military.

In addition, the Cuban service which ha

organized is likely to be the nucleus of a post-Castro

Cuban Government service which will serve KUBARK enda, not

enly on the basis of llaison, but by means of penetrations

of this service already established.

In the swift accomplishment of so many objectives,
