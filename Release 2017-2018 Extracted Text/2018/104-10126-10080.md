Office of Legislative Counsel

SUBJECT : Letter from Chairman Stokes of HSCA on
Direct Access to Former Agent in Mexico

4 1. Action Requested: .That you approve the recommendation
at paragraph 8, supporting the decision of the DDCI to not
provide the HSCA with direct access to a former clandestine
agent in Mexico, and that you renew to Chairman Stokes the
DDCI's offer to obtain answers to written HSCA questions
addressed to the man. :

2. Background: The letter from Mr. Stokes refers to
two agents; we are aware of only one at issue. Prior to the
visit of the nvestigators to Me ity, they were
per ee advised at the Headquarters Building that CIA could not
7 assist them in locating or contacting a former apent. "The

Cuban diplomatic installations at the time of Lee Harvey Oswald's
visit there in 1963. This statement of ‘the Agency's position

they, to

in contacting former Agency employees there, and other
persons with whom the Agency had no direct contact, it had
been instructed to not assist in contacting the agent in
question. When Mr. Blakey learned of this he asked for a
meeting with the DDCI.

4. At the meeting, the DDCI stated the responsibility
of the DCI and DDCI to protect intelligence sources and
methods, and the need to maintain a viable intelligence
collection organization. He expressed the view that making
agents available for direct questioning by congressional

investigators would be injurious to that responsibility. He
offered to accept questions for the agent, and stated that he
would personally vouch for the procedures by which the answers
are obtained. He emphasized that as a Presidential appointee,
confirmed by the Congress, he should be trusted in this action,

especially given the nature of the problem. Mr. Blakey did

ated’ 5.- The Chairman's letter discusses commitments by the ~-
Agency, citing its agreement to arrange access to current and
former employees. There is no explicit commitment to make

“agents available to the Committee. The letter also emphasizes
the Committee's solicitude for the Agency's sensitivities,
citing its not interviewing the agent in Mexico City after
our refusal to assist in making direct contact. In fact, the
Committee has not adhered riggrously to its commitments in this
very area. It failed to inform the Agency of its intention to
intervie in Caracas, as it has agreed to do;

? when te eee nag learned of the plan to interview him,

7h L* objections werd’ registered and ignored, Further, the Committee

failed to notify the Agency that it planned to interview a :
former Agency employee ih MéXico, as it has agreed to do,
and interviewed him with tion help.- In any event, and
contrary to Chairman Stokes’ letter, the DDCI did not say that,
A HSCA investigators could not interview ClA-agents, but
7 i expressed his strong objections to their doing so, noting that
we could not assist them in this respect.. It may be that
inability to locate the agent in Mexico was as much a consideration
for his not being interviewed as concern for the Agency's

sensitivities.

6. Conclusions: The basic problem of providing direct
access to a Clandestine agent goes to the heart of CIA's
relationships with its agents. It involves the Agency's ability
to ensure them of its readiness to protect them from risks of
exposure. While the record of the HSCA, since its reorganization,
has been one of good security, its duration is limited and
continued discipline after the end of this year cannot be
considered a sure thing. To expose this agent, however mino
a figure, is to risk later publicity of the Agency's wilTingness
to-make such an exposure.

7. The DDCI's act involved two considerations. It served
to protect an intelligence source, and at the same time provided
2 procedure whereby the information desired by the Committee
can be obtained. The matter should be presented to Chairman
Stokes in these terms, seeking his agreement to a procedure
based on trust of the personal commitment of Mr. Carlucci to
ensure the integrity of the procedure by which the answers
are obtained. ft

8. Recommendation: That you find the occasion to
accept Chairman Stokes’ invitation to visit him, and explain
to him the basic issue involved in direct access to a clandestine
agent, reassuring him of the Agency's readiness, under
procedures that you and the DDCI will vouch for, to obtain
answers to questions prepared by the HSCA.
