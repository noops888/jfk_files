MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to GS-4 -—_—___-
Charlotte Bustos-Videla

1, It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted
from GS-13 to GS-14,

2, The performance of this officer has been characterized for
many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out-
standing, She has been able to establish herself as indispensable in
each Headquarters Branch or Field Station asd gnment, usually
functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned, Since return
to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico,
her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the
Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude and
growth potential, She is currently chief of-the Cuban and CA Section
of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her
assigned duties, She is the kind of sound, dependable, yet
imuiginative o: ee greatly appreciated by her supervisors, In
short, she is a true professional who performs beyond ler xcade level,

3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency
since 1951, starting as a secretary/stenographer , and adyan ing
brilliantly with.each new challenge offered, She achieved profes:
Status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then specializing
in Latin Americah affairs, demonstrating total flexibility in assignments,
a voracious appetite for work and a penchant for exceptionally precise
and thorough production, A review of her carcer to date can lead to the
conclusion that She has always risen successfully to each new
professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her maximum
capacities, While she has had little supervisory experience in the
field, her supervisor was of the-ophion that she is a "natural leader",
This has been borne out in her'perfermance in her current capacity
asa Branch Section Chief, tn which she has demonstrated exemplary
supervisory ability, Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness and
professional aplomb, She is a popular co-worker, ts receptive to guidance
and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates,

EVES OnLy

4, . This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language
to maximum advantage in her work, Formal testing recently confirmed
her high proficiency in that language. Coupled with a comprehensive
training record and her Invaluable experiences over a twenty year
period, she has become particularly effective in Latin American
operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each
of several recognized specializations, including CI operations,
functional support, reports and requirements, area ea and varied
covert action activities,

5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over
her trade was of {inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and over a
five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's
internal troubleshooter, Her dutics included the maintenance of

get analysis, reperts writing, operational support,
ft agents, and special assignments as the

lation's Executive Assistant,

6, The employce is occasionally called upon by the Office of
Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen
recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending In December 1972,
Meanwhile, her absence from her new job ts felt sorely by tle
Branch, IL is expected that her current assignment will last about

two years,

7, Ui summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has
been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; It is now
time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance

and which she so justly deserves,

performed in-that.same hard-working, highly-productive style which has become
her trademark over the years, She understands the intelligence process from
start to finish and is personally experienced with each step along the way, save the
agent handling aspects. She excels in each phase of the work,

As chief of the Branch SA and Cuban activities section; she has once again
demonstrated her mastery over her assigned duties. She is a sound, dependable,
yet imaginative and energetic operations officer, whose performance leaves Uttle
to,be desired. While she had had Hittle previous supervisory experience, she has
in this assignment demonstrated exemplary supervisory ability, Notwithstanding
her drive, tenacity and attention to detail, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive
to guidance and is sensitive to, and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

“Irher performance of specific duty No. 2, she has brought to bear upon her
daily duties her broad experience, high iiiteligence-and good. operational sense,
functioning with practically no need of close supervision, It is comforting to
know that gn assignment given | to this employee is always done promptly, pro-

established reliability. She never failed to impress her super-

ee Tn reviewing my previous fitness report and
those of my predecessors, on this fine officer, I find myself hard put
not to repeat what has been said so often before. She has been the back-|
bone of this section and of those where she has worked previously. Her
work has always shown excetlent judgement and ingenuity. A self-starter
with tremendous drive and discipline, the amount of work she has produ
has been prodigious. ..An_excellent team worker, she has never shirked wh
as so often happens ~ she is asked to take on additional work or work on
a matter outside of her regular field. While forceful, she is diplomati
and tactful and is able to present suggestions and criticisms in a plea~
gant manner. She is one of the most dedicated persons I have met in the
Organization, and exceptionally dependable. While, as a‘woman and a
Specialist, she has had little opportunity to handle agents she has done
very well with those we have given her to handle, She has showed great
ability in the training of two transcribers and in the debriefing of two
female agents and their husbands, This is in large part due to Her in~
depth -knowledge of the targets this section 18 Working on. THe past Téa”
months have. been difficult, requiring the complete reorganization of this|
Section and the termination of the majority of our assets. - Under this
stress, she has performed in her usual outstanding amanner. Perhaps,
even a little better. Her handling of a great deal of file work has bee!
excellent, probably in part because she was the one who set it up and has|
maintained it in its present very good state. (continued)

SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS i ~continued

Three rathor personalized comments might add meaning
to this fitness report. Anyone, particularly a female,
fitting the above description of efficiency and achicvement
can be, and often is a little overbearing and difficult to
work with as a person. Subject, withall, is a pleasant
Personality who knows how to make her contributions and
comments in a forthright but tactful manner. Secondly, and
this one is a little hard to say, Subject in her voracious
appetite forall kinds of facts can at times put unduc
emphasis on them including factual minutiac as against
equally important but more clusive subjective factors.
Thirdly, this rating officer has personally observed Subject -
only working on station premises at an office job, and
frankly has no idoa how she might function in outside
operational work Bananas

In July 1969 Subject was transferred from fhe iGuba Seotibn to the
Station froat office to serve a3 an executive assistant to the COS with
special; responsibility for ensuring that the paper flow of the Station
remainéd-under effective control during the period of transition re-
sulting from the assignment here of several senior officers, This
transition period necessitated or gave rise to a number of changes in
the management and adninistrative areas of the Station, Subject's
performance in this assignmont under these circumstances was clearly,
outstanding. Her sound judgement, imagination and sesponsiveness to
guidance not only contributed to muintaining the stability and momentum
of the Station but also made possible an early effoct to come to grips
with many of the problems which an inflated Registry and a highly dis-
tinctive records system created for the new Station management tean,

-During the ensuing six month period, Subject has recommended and
implemented a nunber of changes which have prodiced a more offective
and less costly records system, Papor holdings have been rediced sub- .
stautially, input has bgon vediced and sow conforms to basic CS pro-
cedures and requiremonts, Personnel savings have been effected and
supervisory responsibilities more clearly delincated.

To sum up, Subject has mado and continues to make a major contribu-
tion In a singularly unsensational atea of Station activity. Her aivic

Subject is aware that ber current assignment is an unusual one and
that she soon may have worked herself out of her current job. Since
she speaks fluent Spanish, has a uniquo ability to get along with

her back into a position more closely supporting operations, Our

contributions during that period were in the field$ of operational
research and exploitation of information obtained through technical
means. She was, during this period, given full responsability for
the handling of two full time senior transcribers including adminis~

personnel the task of fully exploiting information obtained from
technical sources is of great importance. Subject handled this task
with her usual enormous capability for work, displaying initiative
4nd great professionalism. She continued, in addition, to handle the
other tasks listed in this report together with sensative reporting
sent by a’ separate channel, altogether a much heavier workload than
is usually carried by one person. She was helped in this by her

‘Monnet of gests

This officer is the person chicfly responsiole for the Mexico Desk‘s
deserved reputation for excellence and efficiency. The complicated and
never-ending tasks of project proccasing, clearances, tracing, ond coordination
are handled by her with blinding speed and unerring perfection. Procedural
problems ore there to be solved, and the solutions come with amzing rapidity.
Operational problems are worked out thoroughly and conscientiously. io
cornera are cut and no principles are compromised.

Never at a loss for an ansver, this officer never shrinks from any
assignnent and instinctively wants to take over any vexing problem which 1s
holding up progress. She 1s complete mistress of file ond record resources
and ansvers all queries within minutes. The most complex budgetary and
planning projects are handled by her with deceptive ease.

These qualities of. rare efficiency and speed are coupled with an even
rarer degree of amfability and cooperativeness. The vork which proceeds
under her at such a break-neck pace nonetheless goes on in an air of placidity
and good humor. The large office staff is run without a trace of tension,
Jealousy, or friction. All of this is traceable to this officer's fine

example and catalytic effect on her colleagues.

Finely-educated, handling the Spanish language with fluency, and keeping
up with current events in her area, this officer ts a unique asset to
