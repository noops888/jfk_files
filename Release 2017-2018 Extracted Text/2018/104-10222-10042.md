MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-13 Evaluation Board

SUBJECT

: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-14

Charlotte Bustos-Videla

It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted

from GS-13 to GS-14.

2. The performance of this officer has been characterized for

many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out

standing. She has been able to establish herself as indispensable it. .......

each Headguarters Branch or Field Station ass gnment, usually

functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned. Since return

to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico,

her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the

Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude und

growth potential.

She is currently chief of the Cuban and CA Section

of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her

assigner dutles.

She Is the kind of sound, dependable, yet

imaginative ofticer greatly appreciated by her supervisors. In

short, she is a true professional who pertorms beyond her grade level.

3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency

since 195l, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and advancing

brilliantly with each new challenge offered.

She achieved professional

status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then speclalizing

In Latin Amertcan affairs,

demonstrating total flexibility in assiguments,

a voraclous appetite for wak and a penchant for exceptionally precise

and thorough production. A review of hor career to date can lead to the

conclusion that she has alwys risen successfully to each new

professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her madmun

capacities. While she has bad little supervisory experience in the

field, her supervisor was of the onion that she is a "natural leader".

This has been borne out in her performance in her current capacity

as & Branch Section Chief, in which she has demonstrated exemplary

supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness aud

professional aplomb, she is a popular co-worker, Is receptive to guidance

and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

4. This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language

to martmum advantage in her work. Formal lesting recently confirmed

her high proficiency in that language.

Coupled with a comprehensive

training recurd and her Invaluable experiences over a twenty year

period, she has become particularly effective in Latin American

operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each

of several recognized specializations, Including CI operations,

functional support, reports and requirements, area support and varied

covert action activities.

5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over

ner trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Stallon, and over a

fIve year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station'&

Internal troubleshooter. Her duties Included the maintenance of

target analysis, reports writing, operational support,

handling of

Jagents, and speclal assignments as the

Chief of Station's Executive Assistant.

6. The employee is occastonally called upon by the Office of

Training to administer specialized training, and she was chosen

recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending In December 1972.

vicanwhile, her absence from her new job ta felt sorely by the

I is expected that hor current assignment will lust about

two years.

7. In summary, we have here an exceptional officer who has

been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now

time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance

and which she so justly deserves.

In the 8 months during which she was under my supervision, Mrs. Bustos has

performed in that same hard-working, highly-productive style which has become

her trademark over the years.

She understands the intelligence process from

start to finish and is personally experienced with each step along the way, save the

agent handling aspects.

She excels in each phase of the work.

As chief of the Branch SA and Cuban activittes section; she has once again

demonstrated her mastery over her assigned duties.

She is a sound, dependable,

yet imaginative and energetic operations officer, whose performance leaves little

to,be desired. While she had had little previous supervisory experience, she has

In this assignment demonstrated exemplary supervisory ability.

Notwithstanding

her drive, tenacity and attention to detail, she is a popular co-worker, la receptive

to guidance and is sensitive to, and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

In her performance of specific duty No. 2, she has brought to bear upon her

dally duties her broad experlence, high intelligence and good operational sense,

functioning with practically no need of close supervision.

It is comforting to

know that an assignment giver to this employée is always done promptly, pro-

fessionally and cheerfully.

Her adaptability was demonstrated in her specific duty No. 3.

to take on additional work or work on

While forceful, she is diplomatic

She is one of the most dedicated persons I have met in the

Organization, and exceptionally dependable.

Spectalist,

she has had little opportunity

very well with those we have siven her to handle.

She has showed great

ability in the training of two

transcribers and in the debriefing of two

Inrge part due to her in

depth knowledge of the targets this section is working on.

The past fea

months have been difficult, reguiring the complete reorganization of this

Section and

the ternination of the majority

our assets. Under this

stress,

she has performed in her usual outstanding amanher. Perhaps,

even a

little better.

Her handling

of a great deal of file work has

been

excellent, probably in part because she was

maintained it in its present very good state.

Her major

contributions during that period were

in the fields of operational

research and oxploitation of information obtained through technical

means.

She was, during this period, given full responsability for

the handling of two full time senior transcribers including adminis

trative mattors.

In viow of the difficulty of

technical sources is of great Importance.

and great professionalism.

She continued, in addition, to handlo the

other tasks listed in this report togother with sonsative roporting

is usually carried by one person.

She was helped in this by her

good knowledgo of Spanish, a talent for administrativo work, con-
