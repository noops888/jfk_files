December 14, 1963, Bosch instructed Larede{ Rodriguez, a
treasurer of the R, to pay the sum cf four hundred | j
fifty dollars, via Relis Alpizar, to William Johnson, '
for arrangements in making a plane available for the
flight. On the s, day, this money was paid to Johnson.
Johnson, ace: ied by Alpizar and snother Cuban pilot
known only a amo," proceeded to Broward International

Airport. (ute ¢ he

At Broward International Airport, Johnson
contacted Charles Bush, who operates an aviation company
at the wirport, and made arrangements for Alpiszar to be
afforded practice flying in a red and white Aero Commander
two-engine plane, bearing Registration Number N-2624B.
Bush then accompanied Alpizar in a practice flight which
lasted for about one hour. The cost of this practice flight
was seventy-five dollars, which is being underwritten by
Dr. Orlando Bosch.

MM T+1 learned that this Aero Commander N-26243
is the plane which is scheduled to be used on thie bombing
operation.

MM T-1 said that "Ramo" was offered the opportunity
of serving as copilot on this bombing flight, but he declined
to accept the offer.

On December 16, 1963, MM Tol advised that Evelio
Alpizar took another practice flight on Decesber in the same '
plane, with Charles Bush at Broward International Airport.
MM T-1 learned that Bush is scheduled to fly the Aero Com-
mander from Fort Lauderdale to Bimini, Bahama Islands, and
land it there, preparatory to the bombing operation.’ Bush
will thereafter check into a Bimini hotel and will not be
involved in the actual flight. MM T-1 did not know to
what extent Bush is informed concerning the scheduled bomb-
ing raid. :

MM T-1 advised that the exact date of the raid,
which was tentatively set for December 14 or 15, 1963, has
not yet been set, but Bosch is desirous that tha raid take
place some time during the week which began on December 15,
1963.: MM T-1 said that the date is contingent upon Bush's
first checking out Alpizer ag pilot, and in the meantime ;~—

‘it appears that Bush is emxzious to mike as much money as
possible out of this operation, and may, therefore, be
prolonging the practice flights of Alpizar. MM T-l said
that Alpizar was scheduled, as of Sunday, December 15, 1963,
to again practice with the eame Aero Commander on Decenber 16
and 17,1963. MM T-1 believes that on Decesber 17, 1963,
Alpizar will make a flight over Bimini, weather permitting.

. MM Tel has not yet been able to obtain the
identity of the boat or boats scheduled to be used in
this operation. However, Bosch has disclosed that he
has instructed the Cuban captein of a boat to “stand by".
Bosch has also disclosed that a Cuban, to whom he has
referred both as "Orlando" and as "Ramirez," will be the
bomb expert on the raid. He has advised that this individual
constructs the bombs, and has ‘participated in previous bomb-
ing raids for the MIRR. The bombs are being. constructed
from empty oxygen tank casings, and the fittings on the top
of the casings will be used in connection with detonation
of the bombs. Bosch has algo disclosed that enother crew
man on the bombing flight also participated on previous
bombing flights, and is experienced in bombing matters.
Both "Orlando" and his companion have received training

‘ , by the United States Army, according to Bosch.

ft is to be noted that previous investigation.
States Customs has reflected that

a Cuban exile, is believed to have participated
in prev: Lous boubing raids by the MIRR.

MM T-1 stated that on the basie of cosments made -
by. Bosch and some of his companions, relating to previous ~
raids and to the currently scheduled raid, he is of the

opinion that Bosch pleas to use two boats on this
operation. The larger of the two, which will be 35
to 40 feet long, will leave from the Miami area on an
ostensible fishing trip, during the early evening prior
‘to the scheduled raid. It will rendeavous with a smaller
boat which may depart from the area of Homsatead Bayfront
Park, Homestead, Florida. Laredo Rodriguez, previously
mentioned, possesses an interest in « small farm located
on or near 4 canal im the immediate area of Homestead
Bayfront Park, This farm has previously been utilized
in preparations for similar raids. Also, Laredo Rodriguez
possesses 4 1963. Ford pickup truck, bearing 1963 Florida —
license 16K4254. ‘his truck is a cream colored two door.
It is a "Ford 100." It is easily distinguished by the
fact that thers are old wocdem slats on the sides and
back of the truck. MM Tel was of the opinion that this
truck might be used in connection with preparations for

; raid.
