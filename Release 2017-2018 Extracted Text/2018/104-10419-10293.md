' MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Operations Staff

SUBJECT :., Review of. Agency. Holdings regarding
et Photograph of Unidentified Individual
in Mexico City published by the
- Warren Commission

REFERENCE. : Letter dated 15 April 1975 by
Mr. David W. Belin, Executive Director
of the Commission on CIA Activities: .
within the United States, to
Mr. E. Henry Knoche (copy attached to
accompanying report)

l. This is further to, and in completion of, my
interim memorandum of a few weeks ago.

2. The. attachment is a detailed review in narrative,
chronological order - together with appropriate comment-
ary - of our extensive holdings on the OSWALD case that

. have a bearing on the matter of photographs taken by
Mexico City Station on(i, (4) and @5;october 1963 of an
Unidentified Individual. As a consequence of a combina-
tion of analytical error, misjudgement and under the
stress of an urgent desire to contribute to the develop—
ment of the investigation of the assassination, a
cropped version of one. of the’ photographs of the
Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of
evidence. in the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an
FBI .representative in Dallas. The successive vicissi-
tudes which have now made this event a cause celebre
right down to the present moment are detailed in the
narrative.

3. The attached report is not intended to be an
answer to the Fensterwald/O'Toole article which Mr. Belin
attaches to his memorandum. (I have prepared a paragraph~
by-paragraph refutation and comment on that. article,
‘which I believe is more appropriately handled by a sepa-
rate memorandum to Mr. Belin, and I will prepare this ; as
a memorandum if that is desired.)

4. The point of the referenced memorandum is that™
consideration should be given now to “whether or -not the
entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time." This
submission is designed to make it possible for you,. the feat
IG and others whom you-may desire to consult to make this
decision. The narrative-interpretive summary has been
put. together in such a way that it discloses no cyptonyms,
pseudonyms or other CIA jargon. However, its contents qo
well beyond what has been released to the public thus far
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must
be borne in mind in making a decision on Mr. Belin's :
question.. To remove any question in anybody's mind about
our good faith. in this matter, the narrative is backed up
by. copies of actual documentation from our files. . It
seems. to. me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or
his. representative review the documentation that backs up
the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into
the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronolog:
cal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest
developments in the matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate reference to individual items. [NB: . There

is! only one copy of this collection; this is it]

5. As noted above, one of the photographs taken in
Mexico City.on 4 October 1963 was introduced into the
Warren Commission public record. However, it was intro-
duced into that record in two cropped versions. The
Warren Commission and its staff were made fully aware in
the course of their inquiry at Headquarters and in
Mexico City .of the origins of the photograph, the fact
that we had additional photographs of the same individual
taken at. different times in Mexico City and on the basis
of full knowledge of these facts reached their own con-
clusions regarding the irrelevance of the photograph to
OSWALD and the a

6. In fact, we actually hold twelve different photo-
graphs of the Unidentified Individual. Each of these are*—
reproduced in the collected documentation backing up the
narrative report .(see Items 25 ~ 27). Chief, LA Division,

had indicated in’ writing to Chief, CIOPS,.that he has no
objection. for Mr. Belin.to do whatever is desired with
these photographs at this time. It should be noted that
Mr. Fensterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually. shown, by: |
Mr. Houston during a visit. to the Agency, two of the
twelve photographs, other than the one already published
in the Warren Commission-report. . (It is these two that
he has published in The New York Review of Books article
which Mr. Belin attaches to his memorandum.)

7. %It seems to me that whoever makes’a decision on
whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this
time should bear in mind that a subsidiary decision must
also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up
the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to
publish the entire run of the photographs for the first
time without taking out the background. Obviously, none
of these questions apply to the passage of this material
to Mr. Belin and the Rockeféller Commission itself. TI
think they should see the. entire documentation as it
stands. Perhaps after that, the question of what could
be discussed and the question of "how?" and "how much?"
could be taken. up with Mr. Belin himself. My personal
recommendation is that the more we can say about this
matter in.a fully open and final manner, the better off
we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding
that there are still sensitivé aspects deriving from the
fact that ‘the operation which produced the photographs
was. jointly rin with Mexican liaison and as a consequence

. publication at this time would create additional problems

at that level.in Mexico. Also, it should be noted that
the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to
J.C. King on 22 November.1963 (see Item 8 in the backup
documentation), allegedly: played a direct role in the
decision to put the photographs into the hands of. the. FBI
in Dallas laterally from the Field. As far as I know,
there has not been anything published about this aspect.
at any time in the past nor have.we had any discussions
with the State Department about that aspect of the matter.

3. Under the extraordinary press of effort to develop information i
on the assassin and the assassination, copies of ‘the photograph were
made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on. the afternoon of
22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day, .

assertedly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies were conveyed by

an FBI representative by a special flight carried out by the U.S. Naval

Attache to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing
investigation. One photograph, cropped by the FBI, was. shown to

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the
evening of 23 November 1963 by FBI Agent Bardwell D. ODUM.

4. The Warren Commission's report describes: the sequence of ‘events
at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment B) which ultimately resulted in
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped
photo of Jack RUBY the day before he murdered her.son. (A further
complication compounding this erroneous conclusion was the fact that
when she had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance
before the Canmission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washington in ~

a slightly different manner.)

Lee Harvey OSWALD - Reporting on Mexico City Stay

6. Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or his stay in

Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 to the morning of

2 October 1963,-at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man
originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is important, therefore, to’

“an understanding of the acquisition and handling of the photographs by

the Mexico Station to review what the Station ascertained and did with
the information it developed about OSWALD in Mexico City, together with

Headquarters action on that information.

7. From all credible evidence known to this time (none, incidentally,
added since the exhaustively unique work of the Warren Commission),
Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days and two (2) partial days--

about 116 hours in all--in Mexico City from about 10:00 a.m. 27 September

2 This is the thrust of the article "The CIA and the Man Who Was Not
Oswald" by Bernard Fensterwald and George O'Toole in the New York Review
of Books, a copy of which is attached to reference (Attachment A).

1963 to about 8:30 a.m. 2 October 1963. His place of residence’was a
: ‘small .commercial traveler hotel, not frequented by “gringos" =the z
: Hotel Commercio--where he was registered under alias. Exhaustive: and =
detailed interviews and interrogation by the Mexican authorities and °
the FBI, after the assassination, established that in the recollection ‘of

all hotel personnel he left early: and returned late each day of. his stay.

8. Assuming, and allowing for the fact of late arrival and early
departure, that he slept one-third of the time of his stay (38 or 39

hours), there remain some 78 hours of activity. to be accounted for. °-

Overall, CIA's information can account solely for very brief periods
during 27, 28 September and. 1 October. All coverage by CIA during the

entire period.was technical. The Station had no live source (living

agent) ¢average-either uni Tatenal_or from Mexican_liatsom.

9. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense “under investi-
gation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in the USSR and
return to the U.S., 1959 - 1962, were known to Mexico Station files
before 10 October 1963, when the bare bones of his biography were
forwarded by Headquarters in response to.a Station cabled report of

8 October which had forwarded , on a routine basis, what appeared to be

a contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR. This
was indicated and deduced from technically acquired. information on
1 October, which was the first and only occasion in which OSWALD

identified himself (partially): by true name.

10... At no time during his stay in Mexico City did the cIA acquire.
a photo of OSWALD. A careful review of all coverage, voice intercept, :
as well as photographic, of both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies was
conducted by the Station on 22 and 23 November 1963 after the assassina-
tion, going back to materials from August 1963. It is, therefore, firm

that there was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his

"Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a

cabled request on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD

in its records, nor did it receive one from Headquarters--which did not.

“have one either--before 22 November 1963.

We buvite Fhis intensive review of .voice intercept transcripts
by the monitor and other personnel on the basis of the 1 October inter-

cept--which had been reported to Headquarters and disseminated to the

interested members of the intelligence community (as an ex-Marine OSWALD

was.a Navy and FBI case under the Delimitations Agreement, and potentially
of interest to the Department of State)--turned up matches based on
content with materials intercepted on 27 and 28 September 1963. - These
matches were reported to Headquarters on 23 November 1963.. Analysis
based on voice comparison (except for what could be recalled by the
monitor--and this was not an insignificant element because of. the
memorably poor Russian spoke by OSWALD) could not be made because the

tapes, in accordance with the normal practice, had been erased and re-used.

12 It must be stressed that the voice-intercept and photographic. ~:
coverage was not (and normally is not) processed in “real time." The
means of acquisition and the volume of the information precludes anything
but the spot reporting of items judged by the monitor to be of more than °
ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in summary logs. Full texts of
selected items require consultation of the tape and either a full tran-
scription or full translation or both. Photo coverage tends to. became. a

rapid and accelerated basis in four or five day "peaks." One of the

"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more speedy
review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is the mention of

¢ a name. This was precisely what occurred in the second of two conversa- ~
: tions on 1 October with the Soviet Embassy, during which the speaker said
he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information reported by the Station to
Headquarters in its first indication on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

i 13. The Mexico Station did one more thing in its 8 October report
on Lee OSWALD based on its 1 October voice intercepts: it coupled the

data with descriptive information it had acquired from a sensitive

collateral source--a photograph of a male individual, apparently an
American, who was observed entering the Soviet Embassy on 1 October.
The Station reported this detail on the 8th as a matter of coincident
fact. The Station did not assert or suggest that the data deduced from

the photo was in fact OSWALD, or indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.

Lee Harvey OSWALD - CIA Coverage of His Mexico City Stay

the final precondition to understanding the relevance (or irrelevance)

“OF the photo of the unknown individual placed in the chain of, evidence ~

on 23 November in Dallas by: FBI Agent Bardwell. ODUM: what was the
totality of CIA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity as of: the after-

noon of the 23rd. when all available coverage had been checked?

15. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five. (5) voice intercepts as follows: -

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1605 hours Mexico City time.

Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee of the Cuban
Embassy, Consular section, a recepti onist, speaks with an unknown
male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia DURAN tells the man that the.
American citizen was there, the one who wants a visa for Cuba on
his way to the Soviet Union, and he wants to know with whom he was
talking there because’she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet
Embassy saying that if they accepted him and gave him a visa, then
the Cubans (Embassy). would also give him a visa without further
paper work, only advising Immigration in Cuba. The American, she
says, wants to know with whom he had talked there because he says
he was told there would be no problem. The man in the Soviet

Embassy says to wait a-moment. A different Soviet speaks, .and

_ Silvia DURAN explains the same thing to him. This man says to

 Jeave a ‘name and telephone number and. says he. will call back.

Silvia DURAN gives the telephone 11-28-47 (Cuban Consulate).
She also takes advantage of the conversation and states: she-has

moved and wants to advise the Soviet Embassy of her change of

address so that’ she can receive the Soviet Embassy's Bulletin.

The man says thanks.

b. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1626 hours Mexico City time.

An unidentified male, a Soviet, calls the Cuban Consulate, asks
Silvia DURAN if the American had been there. Silvia DURAN says he
is there now. The Soviet says the American showed papers from’ the
Consulate in Washington, that he wants to go to the Soviet Union
and be there for a long time with his wife, who is Russian, ‘but

the answer has not come from Washington in respect to this problem,
and according to this procedure it takes four or five months, but

from Washington. : i ued
Silvia DURAN agrees the same problem exists with the Cubans, :
that the problem with him-(the Anerican) is that he does not know :
anyone in Cuba’and therefore if-that is true it will be difficult
for him to get a visa for Cuba, because he was thinking of proces-~:
sing his visa (for the Soviet Union), because he knew it would
require waiting. a long time for his visa to the. Soviet Union while :
in Cuba, and from there go to the Soviet Union. The Soviet said
the thing is that if his wife right now were in Washington she
would receive her visa right now, or permission, fron the Soviet
Union, to return to her country, she is going-to receive her visa in
Washington but having this visa, she could conmunicate to any place
this permission, for example here or any place she could receive it
(visa or permission), but. right now they do not have them.
Silvia DURAN says certainly and they cannot give a letter either
because they. do not know if the visa will be approved. The Soviet
says. he cannot give a letter or recommendation either because he
does not know him (the American) and asks to be excused for ~

bothering her. Silvia DURAN says that is all right and many thanks.

c. 28 September 1963 (Saturday), 1151 hours Mexico City time.

Soviet. She says that in the Cuban Embassy there is a North
American who was at the Soviet Embassy.’ The Soviet says wait a

minute. Silvia DURAN speaks English with someone--and comments in

Spanish that they gave APARICIO telephone 14-12-99 and to take the

-number down--Silvia DURAN then says the Anerican citizen is going

to talk with you, i.e., the Soviet. “The Anerican first speaks
Russian and the Soviet speaks English. They continue in English.
The American talks broken Russian and says I-was in your Embassy and |
spoke to your Consul. Just a minute. A Soviet takes the phone and
asks the American in English what does he want? The American’ says
please speak Russian. The Soviet says what else do you want? The
American says I was just now at your Embassy and they took my
address. The Soviet says I know that. The Anerican, in hardly
recognizable Russian, says I did not know it then. I went to the

Cuban Embassy to ask them for my address, because they have it.

with us, it is not far from the Cuban Embassy. The American says

I'l] be there right away.

WwW Summing up, we can state, or by free interpretation reasonably

infer from.the intercept evidence, that OSWALD made or. could have made

the following contacts with the Cuban and Soviet official establishments

in Mexico City...

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday). After arrival and check-in to

his ‘hotel, OSWALD went First to the: Cuban Embassy where he talked
with Mrs. Silvia DURAN. The time of his first Cuban Embassy visit
is unknown. .The time of his second Cuban Embassy visit was about

1600 hours (i.e:, just before closing). \ Sometime between the two

Cuban Embassy visits, at Mrs. DURAN's indication, he must have
visited the Soviet Embassy.. We have no indication who he talked

intercepts a - e above, but others for the 27th and one for 3 October
that seemed to have relevance. These have not been included in this
summary. because they appear, on review, to be excludable from the OSWALD
matter on logical or substantive grounds, or both, bearing in mind that
the Soviet Embassy received many calls pertaining to visa matters.

On the 27th at -1037 hours the Soviet Embassy received a call fron
an unknown individual speaking Spanish who said he wanted visas to go to
Odessa. He was told the Consul was not in and to call back at 1130.
OSWALD is known to have arrived at the Flecha Roja bus terminal on bus
#516 at circa.1000 hours on the 27th. It was, therefore, possible for
him to have made this. call. But granting this, it is unreasonable to
believe the calls were OSWALD's for the following reasons:

a. The caller wanted visas, and specifically for Odessa.
OSWALD.was seeking a visa and never in any context did he specify
the Black Sea port of Odessa as a destination.

The relevance of this intercept to OSWALD is excludable on three
grounds: :

a. The-use of broken Spanish. OSWALD throughout ere broken
Russian or English. He had no competance in Spanish to handle a
conversation of this kind.

b. . The substance of the request indicates a visa request in
the first stages of initiation. OSWALD had developed his matter

well beyond the stage indicated by the substance of this call.

Loredo bus, departing 2. October 1963 at 0830 hours.)

e. 1 October 1963 (Tuesday).. OSWALD made at least two calls,

at 1031 and 1045 hours, to the Soviet.Embassy. He identified himself
twice during the second call when he talked with OBYEDKOV--a quard--
and referred to his talk on Saturday,-probably with KOSTIKOV. There

was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on.1 October; if the follow-

ing reasoning is correct, that was as it should be. From the context
(: : of ‘the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to
the ‘Embassy. His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance. of.
the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October were
concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.
Under those circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe OSWALD

would have gone to the Soviet Embassy on that date.

18. The camera at. about mid-day registered the entry into the

Soviet Embassy of a white-shirted individual who, in the: opinion of the

c. OSWALD had left Mexico City, based on all the credible
evidence, the early morning of the previous. day, 2 October, and
could not have made this local call.

guard [Ivan] OBYEDKOV, who answered, if there was
anything new regarding a telegram to Washington.

“ OBYEDKOV upon checking ‘said nothing had been

received yet, but the. request had been sent.

_(2)' Mexico Station’ said it had photos of a male
who appeared to be an American entering the Soviet
Embassy at 1216 hours.. leaving 1222 on 1 October.
Apparent age 35, athletic build, circa 6 feet,

(3) No local dissemination was being made by the

Station.

21. On 10 October 1963 at 2012Z time the WH Division responsible
for action disseminated this report to the Department of State, the FBI,
and. the Navy Department by routine electrical transmission, adding some

collateral details drawn fron a preliminary file review:

(1) On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive
source in Mexico reported that an American male,
who identified himself as Lee OSWALD, contacted
the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring

whether the Embassy had received any ‘news con-
cerning a telegram which had been sent to
Washington. The American was described as
approximately 35 years old, with an athletic
build, about 6 feet tall, with a "receding"

hairline.

(2) It is believed that OSWALD may be identical
to Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD, born on 18 October 1939
in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine
who defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959
and later made arrangements through the United
States Embassy in Moscow to return to the United
States with his Russian-born wife, Marina

Nikolaevna PUSAKOVA [sic] and their child.

(3). The information in paragraph (1) is being
disseminated to your representatives in Mexico City.
Any further information received on this subject
will be furnished you. This information is being
made available to the Immigration and, Naturalization

Service.

Although the reaction of the Headquarters desk was “by the

book" and in good time, there were a number of errors in this advisory

to the departments which, on the record, were concerned with the OSWALD

case:

18
SECRET



13-00000

SECRET

a. -OSWALD's middle name was misgiven: . "Henry" for, Harvey.

The reason for this mistake is simplicity itself.- The sheet opening
“the. file on OSWALD on 9 December 1960 had been erroneously inscribed
“OSWALD, Lee Henry." That sheet--unchanged except for the notation of
the error--is, still the first sheet in the OSWALD file.

b.. His wife's maiden name was misspelled: "PUSAKOVA" for PRUSAKOVA.

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

Headquarters communicati ons throughout the month). More important was:

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with
a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual
observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to
Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,
“appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The American."

There can bé no question that this misreading of the Mexico Station report
was an analyst's error which escaped detection in the coordination before -
release: the descriptive details attri buted to OSWALD were so far off the
mark. as to be immediately recognizable as such by the recipients in Head-
quarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had photos of OSWALD. (In partial
explanation, if not exculpation, be it recalled that as of that moment CIA

had no photograph of OSWALD in Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

23. Confirmation of this judgment is provided by the contents of.
the cable composed by the same analyst and sent as-of 2209Z time (two

hours later) to Mexico Station, referencing its 8 October cable:

SECRET

(1) Lee OSWALD who called SovEmb 1 October

18 October 1939, New Orleans, Louisiana, former
radar operator: in United States Marines who

defected to USSR in October 1959. OSWALD is

- five feet ten inches, one hundred sixty five

pounds, light brown wavy hair, blue eyes.

(2). On 31 October, 1959 he attempted to renounce
his United States citizenship to the United States
Embassy in Moscow, indicating he had applied for
Soviet citizenship. On 13 February the US Embassy
Moscow received an undated letter from OSWALD
postmarked Minsk on 5 February 1961 in which sub-
ject indicated he desired return of his US passport
as he wished to return to USA if ."we. could come

to some agreement concerning the dropping of any
legal proceedings against me." On 8 July on his
own initiative he appeared at the Embassy with

his wife to see about his return to States.
Subject stated that he actually had never applied
for. Soviet citizenship and that his application

at. that time had been to remain in USSR and for a
temporary extension of his tourist visa pending
outcome of his request. This application, according

to OSWALD, contained no reference to Soviet

employed since 13 January 1960 in Belorussian
radio and tv-factory in Minsk where he worked .
as a metal worker in. research shop. OSWALD vias

PUSAKOVA [sic], a dental technician born v7 duly
1941, USSR. No-Headquarters traces. He
attempted to arrange for his wife to join him in
Moscow so she could appear at Embassy for visa
interview. His American passport was returned
to him. US Embassy Moscow stated twenty months
of realities of life in Soviet Union had clearly

had a maturing effect: on OSWALD.

(3). Latest Headquarters information was an FBI
report dated May 1962 saying the FBI had deter-
mined OSWALD is still a US citizen and both he
and his Soviet wife have exit permits and
Department of State had given approval for their

travel with their infant child to USA.

(4) The Station should pass the information of
reference [its 8 October cable] and paragraph (1)
above to the Embassy, the FBI, the Navy, and I&NS

locally. The information given above as

(5) Reference and possible identification

24. Headquarters feedback to Mexico City of OSWALD's correct

“description should have been sufficient, in view of the incongruities

with the details deduced.from the photo of the unidentified male, to-
keep these two matters apart as investigative facts. But things did not

work out that way.

25. Mexico Station on 15 October 1963 asked: Headquarters to
"please pouch a photo of OSWALD." Headquarters electrically delivered
to the Department of the Navy the following message on 24 October 1963.

"Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD :-. .

“It is requested that you forward to this office
as soon as possible two copies of the most recent

No photo had been received by CIA by 22 November 1963.

26. Within its Timitations and Capabilities, Mexico station had :

all it could to comply with Headquarters instructions: :

a. Headquarters had been alerted, and in turn those agencies ;
with an investigative or policy interest in OSWALD as an American
in the United States. had been alerted; both in Washington and-in
the field.

b. Mexico: Station had no further contacts by OSWALD to report
because--as it was ultimately ascertained--he had left Mexico City

on 2. October.

c. .OSWALD was. not an Agency investigative responsibility, in
any case. Even with a photograph, it would have taken very special
efforts, triggered by the other interested U.S. agencies, to have
made a positive identification in view of OSWALD's hotel registra~

tion under alias.

There the matter rested until mid-day 22-November 1963.

The Insertion of the Photo of the Unidentified Individual ‘into the

Chain of Evidence

27. On 22 November 1963 the Mexico Station cabled Headquarters at

2229Z time after learning of the arrest of Lee H. OSWALD, age 24,

“priority Pouch a photo of OSWALD so that Station
can check. all recent coverage for OSWALD. < Forward-
ing soonest copies of only visitor to Soviet Embassy

on 1 October who could be identical with OSWALD."

28. It is élear that Mexico Station had forgotten that: according. :

_to its. own communication the unidentified male in the photo was of :

“apparent age.35" and that the accurate description of OSWALD forwarded
by Headquarters on.10 October precluded the identity with OSWALD of. the
person whom they regarded as the "only visitor to the Soviet Embassy on

1 October who could be identical." -

29. The Station meanwhile had begun an exhaustive.and accelerated
review of all its technical. and photographic intelligence. A dispatch
was prepared in accordance with the indication given in the cable of
22 November, cited in paragraph 25 above. The dispatch noted that
photo coverage of the unidentified individual had turned up on 4 and
15 October at. the Soviet and Cuban Embassies, respectively. The text
of the 22 November 1963 pouched dispatch read:

"|. Attached are copies of the only photographs

Mexico, on that date... 2.

"P.S. Photographs dated 15 October 1963 were tina

inserted after typing of dispatch. These were

taken as [the] person entered the Cuban Embassy."

Attached were eight photographs:. four (of which two were marked
; 1 October on reverse) showing the individual in a white shirt, and four
“unmarked on reverse) showing the individual in a black shirts It
would seem to be logical that the word "sets" was probably omitted from

paragraph two of the dispatch between the words ““two" and "photographs."

30.. That the Station was working under forced draft is clearly

E apparent from the text of the dispatch, which tacked on a material fact
as a postscript. That fact was reported simultaneously by cable’ to

Headquarters at 0053Z time, 23 November:

“I. Mexico Station has. photos same unidentified

31. Headquarters, at 0136Z time, 23, November 1963, asked Mexico
Station to send a staff member with all photographs to Headquarters. on

the next available flight.

“3. Concurrently with or before the foregoing cables to Headquarters,

the Chief of Station, Mexico City, had spoken directly by double-tatk

and secured permission to give copies of the photographs of the uniden- ;

33. - What happened next is best reflected in.a personal note by the
Chief of Station to the WH Division Chief, mailed to the latter fron
Dallas, together with copies of the photographs , by the Legal Attaches

representative who delivered them to the FBI in that city.

"The FBI says that the photos of the man
entering the Soviet Embassy which Mexico
Station sent to Dallas were not of Lee OSWALD.
Presume Mexico Station has ‘double-checked

dates of these photos and is also checking all

pertinent photos for possible shots of OSWALD."

€ 37. And at this point, .2048Z time, 23 November, Mexico Station

‘Finally agreed:

"Saw photos of Lee OSWALD on television night of
22 November and it obvious photos sent to Dallas
“were not identical with Lee OSWALD held in Dallas.

Dates are as given on photos.

"Mexico Station is reviewing all available photos

of persons entering Soviet and Cuban Embassies."

38. Two hours later (2254Z time, 23 November. 1963) the Station had

reported the results of its effort to review all available coverage:

“Complete recheck of photos of all visitors to ~

evidence of OSWALD visit.’ Similar blank against

all Soviet Embassy photos fron 1 September. :

Note, -only visit we know he made to Cuban Embassy _

28 September, Saturday, on which Embassy closed ;

and we had not had coverage... ."

39. With this communication the matter of the “unidentified

_ individual" reaches the end of Phase I, the key element of which is the ©

conviction, at first latent, then expressed, that the photographed ~
individual might be identical with OSWALD. This applies especially to”
the Station, though at a certain point even Headquarters moved no
rebuttal despite the hard fact that the description of OSWALD and the

unidentified individual were quite disparate.

40. This review has attempted to deal even-handedly with all items
in the case record that have a bearing on what happened. - The operational
zeal, innovativeness, and the high committment of all involved,
especially in Mexico City, speaks for itself.. Equally apparent--
because of the 20/20. advantage of hindsight--is the evidence of
non-performance. It was a critical failure, for example, that.no photo
of OSWALD was made available--though it was expressly requested both at

Headquarters and by the field--or that it was not more aggressively

obviated--in a way the mere possession of.a correct: physical description

evidently could not--the whole successive deterioration of what began’ in

“Mexico city as an impressionistic selection of the photograph on

1 October 1963 into a cause celebre today.

40. ‘It should be clear from this factual survey that never had! |
there been a cause celebre with less intrinsic merit. It is equally
clear from the facts themselves that there was nothing contrived or
conspired in what happened, unless we have now descended to that point
in human values achieved under STALIN in the USSR and under HITLER in

Germany, where just a plain mistake .is per se evidence of conspiracy.

41. Special Agent of the FBI, Bardwell D. ODUM, on 23 November
1963 showed one of the six photos flown up from Mexico City the previous
day to OSWALD's mother, Marguerite OSWALD. ODUM himself had trimmed off.

cropped version of one of those noted under paragraph 43b,. above--was
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a picture of . ;
her son's killer, Jack RUBY, a day before he perpetuated the deed’. . Again
the Warren Commission Report (pp. 364-365,'367) exhaustively disposes.
of this erroneous charge and requires no repetition here. A complica-

the ODUM photograph became Commi ssion Exhibit 237 (see ‘Hearings

45. . The net. effect. of. the developments in the hearings. of. the
Commission was to require the ‘admission of the cropped photograph into.
evidence in a chain of depositions beginning with ODUM, including the
FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed the photograph ‘used by.
the Commission in Washington),. and Richard HELMS, who deposed for the :
originator, These documents speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearings, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other’ senior Agency officers strongly
advised against. the publication of the photograph in any form on the
grounds that the Soviets would be immediately alerted to the existence
of a useful. and continuing U.S. intelligence operation, and the opera-
tion-would go down the drain. There were repeated cables excharged on
this:-point between Headquarters and Mexico Station. during the summer
of 1964, in particular fron 23 September to 15 October 1964 when the

Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

Within.a week of the public appearance of the Odum Exhibit No. 1 and
Commission Exhibit 237, members of the Soviet Embassy began systematic
efforts to survey the surrounding buildings, ostensibly for rental -
space, but clearly. their inquiries were directed to spotting possible
camera- sites. The operation was continued in any case. Within ayer
it had become almost totally unproductive in coverage on Americans in

of the Agency, Lawrence R. HOUSTON, CIA voluntarily ‘submitted a
statement about the photograph to Judge BAGERT of the Criminal
District. Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana.

that had been delivered to the United States Marshall in the District

of Columbia, despite the fact that the subpoena-could not be -

inferences made by Mr. GARRISON in New Orleans about the photograph

of the unidentified individual: The following is extracted from

"Because. of the publicity which has surrounded the
Orleans. Parish Grand Jury proceedings, we have
recently carried out an exhaustive search of the
files of the Central Intelligence Agency for any
picture of Lee Harvey OSWALD taken in Mexico. As

a result of this search, I can state. categorically

that. the files of this Agency do not contain, and
never have contained, any such picture of

no information whatsoever that any such photograph
ever existed. To the best of our knowledge and
information, therefore, there is no such photograph.
Furthermore, the photograph which is printed in the
Warren. Commission Report, Exhibit No. 237 in Volume
XVI, never contained more than one figure, and the

figure in the photograph depicts an individual who,

to our knowledge, has not. been identified. The
circumstances of the filing of this photograph with

on this occasion Mr. FENSTERWALD, who was accompanied by his..
partner; ‘Mr. William OHLHAUSEN, told Mr.: HOUSTON and another

representative of the Agency in attendance that_he knew who the

Memorandum -of Record, 8 April 1971:

"3. Mr. FENSTERWALD came to ity office this —
morning with his partner, William G. OHLHAUSEN,
looked at the other photographs, and told us he
did know who the man was. He said he is presently
serving a prison term somewhere in the United
States and admitted that he had known OSWALD, but
Mr. FENSTERWALD said there was nothing to indicate
any connect on between the man in the photographs
and the assassination. of President KENNEDY.

Mr. FENSTERWALD did not give us the man's name at
this time, as he said enough people had suffered

unnecessarily from allegations that they were

asked how he could use them. He said he did

in Mexico. I asked whether the prisoner had any
conspiratorial relationship with OSWALD.
FENSTERWALD replied he did not know the answer

Although portions of this record have ‘been released to the
public, other portions have remained classified because

of concerns by the CIA at the time that a release of the
full picture might disclose sources and methods which the
CIA felt were not in the national interest to disclose at_
that time. In light of the false allegations about. the
assassination of President Kennedy and the false allegations
of CIA involvement, I feel that it would be appropriate to
reconsider whether or not the entire matter, can be fully
disclosed at this time. >

I would like to receive by April 22 ‘a, full report fron:

SRTTACHMENT BO”

While Oswald’s family resided with Mrs. Paine, Witliain F. 5 Simons,
pianoplayer in the musical combo which worked, at the Carousel Club
from September 17, 1963, until November 21, 1963, lived at 2539 West
Fifth Street, in Irving. Simmons has stated that his only relation-
ship to Ruby was as an employee, that Ruby never visited him, that
he did not know Oswald, and that he had never seen Oswald at the
‘Carousel Club." Other persons in the neighborhood, knew of no
connection between Ruby and Oswald.t* °

The Commission has investigated rumors that Jacke ‘Ruby ‘ond Tee
Harvey Oswald were both homosexuals and, thus, might have known
each other in that respect. However, no evidence has been uncovered
to support the rumors, the closest acquaintances of both men em-
phatically deny them**?.and Ruby’s nightclubs ‘were not’ known to
have been frequented by homosexuals."

rennin AARC NONE tn

Harvey Oswald arises from the testimony of Oswald’s mother, Mar-
guerite Oswald.’ When appearing before thé Commission, Mrs.
Oswald related that on November 23, 1963, before Ruby'shot Oswald,
FBI Agent Bardwell D: Odum showed her a picture of 2 man she
believed was Jack Ruby, and asked whether the man shown wis
familiar to her. Odum had first attempted to see Marina Oswald, but
Marguerite refused to allow Marina to be disturbed: at that time."
In the course of Marguerite’s testimony, the Commission asked the
FBI for a copy of the photograph displayed by Odum to her.. When
Marguerite viewed the photograph provided the Commission, she
stated that the picture was different from the one she saw in November,

the man depicted was not Jack Ruby.t#*

The Commission has investigated this matter and determined that
Special Agent Odum did show a picture to Marguerite Oswald. for
possible identification: but that the picture was not of Jack Ruby.
On November 22 the CIA’had provided the FBI with a’ photograph’
of a man who, it was thought at the time, might have been associated
with Oswald. To prevent the viewer from determining precisely
where the picture had been taken, FBI Agent Odum had trimmed the
background from the photograph by making a series of straight cuts
which reduced the picture to ‘an irregular hexagonal shape.™** The
picture which was displayed by the Commission to Marguerite Oswaid
was a copy of the same picture shown her by Agent Odum; however,
in supplying a duplicate photograph for Commission use the FBI
had cropped the background by cutting-along the contours of the
body of the man shown,” resulting in a photograph without any
background, unlike the first photograph Marguerite viewed on No-.

‘Mrs. Oswald before the Commission, though trimmed differently from
the one shown her on November 23, was a copy of the same picture.
Neither picture was of Jack Ruby.’ 189 ‘The original photograph had
been taken by the CIA outside of the United States sometime between

Study of Jack Ruby’s background, which is set out more fully in

-’ appendix XVI, leads to.the firm conclusion that he had no such ties.

Business activities ——Ruby’s entire life is characteristic of a rigor-
‘ously independent person. He-moved from his family home soon
after leaving high school at’ age 16, although a “family” residence has
been maintained: in Chicago throughout the years.*° Later, in 1947,
he moved from Chicago to Dallas and maintained only sporadic con-

“tact with most of his family?°' “For most of his working years and

continuously since 1947, Jack Ruby was self-employed2** Although
he had ners from time to time, the partnerships were not lasting,
and Ruby seems to have preferred: to.operate independently.
Ruby's main sources of income were his two nightclubs—the Carou-
sel Club’ and the Vegas Club—although he also frequently pur-
sued a numberof independent, short-lived business promotions.
(Ruby’s business dealings are described in greater detail in app.
XVL) - At the time of the assassination, the United States claimed
approximately $44,000 in delinquent taxes, and he was in substantial
debt to his brother Earl and to his friend Ralph Paul. However,
there are no indications that Earl Ruby or Ralph Pau] was exerting ~

pressure for payment or that Ruby’s tax liabilities were not susceptitie—————==
to an acceptable settlement. Ruby operated his clubs on a cash esi

usually carrying large amounts of cash on his person; thus thers-is
no particular significance to the fact that approximately $3,000 in
cash was found on his person and in his automobile when arrested.
Nor do his-meager financial records reflect any suspicious activities.
He used ‘his bank accounts only infrequently, with no unexplained
large trarisactions; and no entries were made to Ruby’s safe-deposit

in over a year prior to the shooting of Oswald? There is
no evidence that Ruby received any sums after his arrest except royal-
ties from a syndicated newspaper article on his life.and small contri- .-
butions for his defense from friends, sympathizers, and family
members, .

Ruby's political activities—Jack Ruby considered himself a Dem-
ocrat, perhaps in part because his brother Hyman had been active
in Democratic ward politics in Chicago. . When Ruby was arrested,
Police officers found in his apartment, 10 political cards urging the
election of the “Conservative Democratic slate,” ™* but the: Commis-
sion has found no evidence that Ruby had distributed that literature
and he isnot known ever to have campaigned for any political candi-

It is also clear that even his better written letters contained some di:
tinctive elements of spelling, grammar, and punctuation that..were
common to his poorer efforts. Oswald wrote in his diary that he
received whelp from his Intourist. Guide, “Rima Shirokova,:in. the
preparation of his letter of October 16, 1959, to the Supreme Soviet.

Speculation:—A Negro janitor who was a witness tothe shooting and
‘was supposed to be-able to-identify Oswald as the:killer was held in.
protective custody by the Dallas police until he could appear before
the President’s Commission on the Assassination cof : President”
Kennedy. :

the Dallas police for appearance before the Commission. «. ‘The: story: ;

Speculation——The Secret Service incarcerated Marina Oswald i im-"
mediately after the assassination.

Commission finding—Marina Oswald was given protection by the a
Secret Service for a period of time after ‘the assassination. She had...
freedom to communicate with others at anytime she desired, to go -
where she pleased, or to terminate the protection at any time.?*.«:~

Speculation.—Mrs. Marguerite Oswald was shown'a photograph of.
Jack Ruby by an FBI agent the night before Ruby killed her son.

Commission finding—On the night of November 23, 1963, Special:
Agent Bardwell D..Odum of the FBI showéd Mrs. Marguerite Oswald
a picture of a man to determine whether the man was known to her.
Mrs. Oswald stated subsequently that the picture’ was of Jack Ruby.
‘The Commission has examined a copy of the photograph and deter-
mined that it was not a picture of Jack Ruby. aut

Speculation—The son: of the only witness to the Tippit ‘dlaying
was arrested after talking to some private investigators and | soon
plunged to his death from an unbarred jail window. : :

Commission finding —According to Mrs. Helen Markham, one of.
the witnesses to the Tippit slaying, Mrs. Marguerite Oswald and two :
men who claimed to be reporters from Philadelphia sought:to inter-. °°

Oswald matter and the shooting of Patrolman Tippit. . William Ed-
ward Markham had been in Norfolk, Va., at the time of the assassina-"*. =
tion and had not returned to Dallas until May 7, 1964. He had no =
personal knowledge of the shooting of, Patrolman, Tippit. On June
30, 1964, another of Mrs. Markham’s’sons, James Alfred Markham,
was arrested at Mrs. Markham’s apartment by Dallas Police: on a
charge of burglary. While trying to escape, he fell from the bathroom’
of the apartment to a concrete driveway about 20 feet below. He was
taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, treated for-injuries, and after;
614 hours was taken to jail. As of July 31, 1964, he was in Dallas - .
County Jail awaiting trial. There was also a warrant outstanding
against him for parole violation.“
