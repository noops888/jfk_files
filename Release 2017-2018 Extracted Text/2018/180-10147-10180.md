“IL. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select
Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for
Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the
investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as
follows:

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense Ey et

of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

On November 23, 1963 Helms called a meeting of senior-

else and I put a lot of my officers to work

Mr. Goldsmith. Well, when I said to what extent
was the Cuban connection investigated, I don't mean by
the Warren Commission. I mean to what extent did the
Agency provide --

Mr. Rocca. That I can't answer. I certainly
didn't, do it.

Mr. Goldsmith. Pardon me?
Mr. Rocca. We certainly didn't, in R & A.
Mr. Goldsmith. So, CI/R & A did not --

Mr. Rocca. Go into the Cuban side of it at all.
This was something left to the people who were concerned
specifically with Cuban intelligence and security operation.

Mr. Goldsmith. But I believe earlier we
established that Mr. Helms gave orders that information
pertinent to the assassination was to go through your
office, correct?

Mr. Rocca. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. And once information pertinent
to the assassination went through your office, I take (it)
you or Mr. Helms would decide what information would
be relevant for the Warren Commission to see.

Is that correct?

Mr. Rocca. Well -~

Mr. Goldsmith. Based upon what you knew?

Mr. Rocca. Well, everything would go, yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Therefore, you were in the
position, it would seem, to know what information was
being generated in the field that was going to the

Warren Commission.

Earlier I asked you which area received emphasis
and I believe you indicated that the Soviet area (did).

in late December 1963 - early January 1964 for the

A, Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of
the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of
the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-
generated information to the Warren Commission. The
general cansensus of these representatives is that the
Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful
working relationship during the course of the Commission's

investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,

p. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,
8/9/78, pp} 24.) William Coleman, a senior staff counsel
for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

NERY.

"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information
bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance
to the Warren Commission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the
supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was
propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the

(Ibid., p. 23. ) He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren’ Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, p. 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com-
mission). We would attempt to respond to it.
But these inquiries came in individual bits an®
pieces or as individual items...Each individual
item that came along we took care of as best we
could. (Ibid., pp. 10-11.)

oath he supported this proposition:

Mx. Goldsmith: In summary, -is it your position that
the Agency gave the Warren Commission

Mr. Helms: That is correct.

I want to modify that by saying that

times or circumstances under which some-

between Committee Counsel and Mr. Helms illustrates

?0£ the Agency's compromise:

Mr. Goldsmith: Mr. Helms, I take it from your
testimony that your position is
that the anti-Castro plots, in
fact, were relevant to the
Warren Commission's work; and,
in light of that, the Committee
would like ta be informed as to
why the Warren Commission was
not told by you of the anti-
Castro assassination plots.

Mr. Helms: I have never been asked to testify
before the Warren Commission about
. Our operations.

Mr. Goldsmith: If the Warren Commission did not
know of the operation, it certainly
- was'not in a position to ask you
about it.

Is that not true?

Mr. Helms: Yes, but how do you know they did

i eceererenrerenrrroeanri not know about it? How do you
know Mr. Dulles had not told them?
How was ‘I to know that? And bes ties?
I was not the Director of the Agency

mission or to Congressional Committees
or to anyplace else without the

Agency or causing an international crises he gave

the following response:

employed to enable CIA to work cooperatively
with the Commission in a manner which would Se oo.

Among the policies articulated were two which

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments
could reasonably be interpreted to indicate possible
foreknowledge, the CIA position is as follows:

GR,

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,
Calderon's conversation was identified

as ? possible item of information from

thel Agency's} Cuban and Soviet [telephone il
[intercepts]that might suggest foreknowledge

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-
dent. This involves a faulty translation of an
answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer
to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."
The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere
(the first person of the verb enterarsefe,
past tense) should be translated as ".?.1 found

g out (or I learned) /about it -- the assassination,

ER

almost before Kennedy /did7." In other words, ~
Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting
of Kennedy almost at the time the event took
place..." (CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding

Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

Yee.

ty,

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's
position that translation of Me Entere as

either “I found out" or "I learned about" 4, + .«
does not foreclose interpretation of Calderon's
comments as a suggestion on her part of possible
foreknowledge of President. Kennedy's assassination.

Langosch paraphrased AMMUG's knowledge of Calderon
as. follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have
had contact with Oswald because I learned
about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made
a trip to Mexico, that she had been
involved with an American in Mexico. The
information to which I refer was told to

to (him) that it seemed strange that iuisa
Calderon was receiving a salary from the
DGI although she apparently did not do
any work for the Service. (The case officer)
told me that hers was'a peculiar case and
that he himself believed that she had been
recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence
Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head
of the DGI, did not agree. As I recall,
(the case officer) had investigated Luisa
Calderon. This was because, during the time
she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted
a letter to her by an American who signed
his name OWER (phonetic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation

different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love
letter but indicated that there was a
clandestine professional relationship

I also understand from (the case officer)
that after the interception of the letter
she had been followed and seen in the

this could have been Cswald...(Ibid.)

1963? If so, please indicate whén and

in what form this information was provided,

The CIA responded by memorandum: |

“Although the (Mexico ty)-Station considered
the conversation 6f Sufficient possible
interest to send a copy to headquarters,
the latter apparently did nothing with
it, for there appears to be no record in the
Oswald file of such action as may have

The available evidence thus supports the
conclusion that the Warren Commission was never
given the information nor the opportunity by
which it could evaluate Luisa Calderon's
significance to the events surrounding President
Kennedy's assassination. Had the Commission been

However, there are indications that such contact
“between Calderon and the Agency was contemplated.
A September 1, 1963 CIA dispatch from the Chief
of the Special Affairs Staff to the CIA's Chief

of Station in Mexico City states in part:

:+-Luisa Calderon has a sister residing
in Reynosa, Texas, married to an American
of Mexican descent. If (CIA asset) can
further identify the sister, our domestic
exploitation section might be in a posi-
tion to follow up on this lead...Please
levy the requirement on (CIA asset) at
the next opportunity. (CIA Doc. HMMW-

An earlier CIA dispatch from the CIA Chief

of Station in Mexico City to the Chief of the CIA's

[wire redo of jthe Cuban Consulate, (Tampico,
reported that Luisa Calderon has a sister
residing in Reynosa, Texas...Luisa may go
up to the border to visit her sister soon--
or her mother may make the trip--details
not clear (CIA Doc. HMMA 21849, July 31,

At the very least, the above dispatches La Jeet deta

and her family. Whether this interest took

the form of a clandestine-agent relationship is

*The CIA memorandum states in part as follows:

g When CI Staff learned of AMMUG-1's defection
and considered the possibility that he
might have some knowledge of the Oswald
case, CI Staff submitted a list of questions
to WH (Western Hemisphere) for debriefing
AMMUG-1...WH desk records reflect that
. AMMUG-1 was debriefed on 4 May 64 regarding
this questionnaire.../B/ecause the debriefing
on the Oswald case was handled as a sensitive
matter, it was dictated directly to a CI
(Counterintelligence) stenographer on
5 May 1964. /Note: A-1 was debriefed on
several subjects on 4 May 64. ‘The procedure
was to assign each subject discussed a
debriefing number and they were written
up in contact report form by the WH case
officer. The instructions from CI staff
were to handle the Oswald case debriefing
very closely and not to keep any copies in
WH Division/. The "Oswald Case" was
logged in the WH notebook log as debriefing
report number 40, but the report itself
was dictated by the WH Case Officer directly
7 to a CI staff stenographer. There would
“ be no reason to include the number 40 on
the report of this special debriefing for
CI staff, since it was their only debriefing
report. We are certain it is the debriefing
report (#40) because the date is the same; ’
it is the only debriefing report on Oswald oe
listed in AMMUG-1 records; and it it (sic)
the only AMMUG-1 debriefing report in
Oswald's 201 file.

a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA
eryptonym AMLASH/1) who, during 1962 while meeting
with a CIA representative expressed the desire to
assassinate Fidel Castro (Ibid., p.- 84). Asa
result of AMLASH's expressed objective and the

Richard Helms, as the highest level. CIA

Operation was relevant to the investigation of
President Kennedy's death. (Rockefeller Commission,
Testimony of Richard Helms, 4/24/75 PP. 389-391;392)
In addition, Mr. Helms testified before this

to be an assassination plot (Exec. Sess. Test. of

Langosch, as the Chief of Counterintelligence
for the Special Affairs Staff, was responsible for
safeguarding SAS against penetration by foreign
intelligence services, particularly the Cuban
Intelligence Services (HSCA Classified Affidavit
of Joseph Langosch, 9/14/78, p. 3). It was

Langosch further recollected that as of 1962

p *In response to Langosch's sworn statements, this
Committee has received from the CIA an affidavit
executed by Kent L. Pollock (CIA pseudonym) who “served
as Executive Officer for Desmond FitzGerald during the
“entire period in which he was Chief of the Special Affairs
Staff...and discussed with him the AMLASH operation as it
progressed." (CIA Doc., Affidavit of Kent L. Pollock,
executed Oct. 5, 1978, p. 1) Mr. Pollock specifically
contested Langosch's assertion that the AMLASH operation
was characterized by the Special Affairs Staff, Desmond
FitzGerald, and other senior level CIA officials as an
assassination operation. In pertinent part, Pollock G
4 drew the following conclusions:

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald
considered the AMLASH operation to be a political
action activity with the objective of organizing
a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the
Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat. I heard
Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation
frequently, and never heard him characterize it as
an “assassiantion operation." Mr. FitzGerald
stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves
loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

uN

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH
operation as an “assassiaftion operation"; the

case officer did not; I,~as Executive Officer, never
discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with
Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the oth€r #
branch chiefs and the special assistants could not
have so characterized it since they did not know
about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with a
hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH
for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.
The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day

g of President Kennedy's death. AMLASH rejected the

pen with disdain. /Ibid., par. 4, p. 27), (Ibid.,
