SUBSECT : Handling of AMUG-I1 Operation

L During a meeting with Mr. Hood, C/WH/Ops; Air. Cheever,
DC/WH/SA and Mr. Swenson, C/WH/SA/CI on 23 June 1964,
Air. Swenson revowed the following points concerning the handling
af the AMMUG-1 operation. These points were the subject of
earlier discussions by A.r, Swenson and the various Branch chefs
in WH Division.

2. From the outset WH/SA/CI's proposed action for handling
AbMUG-1 has been:

a. To debrief Abia!GG-1 soonest and to get the information
to the appropriate country deaks as soon a6 possible. To run
traces, including field traces, and to analyze the results. Tiaces
to be run by WH/SA/CI on Cunan Is staffers and by the WH country
desks on Cuban IS agents in their respective countries,

b.. To select the best targets froin the individuals identified
by AMMUG-1 and to hit them in order of priority, considering their
overall value, chance of success, accessability and perishability.
pie aaitii of targets to be done jaintly by WH/SA/CI and the WH

() To give consideration to approaching the Cuban IS
agents before the Cuban Is staffers since the agents are leas likely
to now about AMA.UG-l's defection and in most cases they have a
greater communication proole:a in reporting back to the DGI, (The
Cuban IS staifers known to AMAUG-~I1 can not all be recalled or
tranaferred, and even if tranaferred could still te hit by AMAiUG-L )



vel

(4} To use AbiS;UG-1 for making pitches to selected
targets, agents first and stalfere second as explained above,

c provide the information acquired from debriefing

d Meanwhile, as in the AMNIP-1 case (another Cuban IS :

devector who has provided us with consideraple information and

has-been used in a number of approaches), to disseminate appropriate

information to the U.S. intelligence community, In the case of

personalities, the CSCI dissemination would conaist only of biographic

and descriptive data furnished by AMALUG-1, including appropriate

Headquarters traces, We would request information from: then in
return. (This procedure has. been used in the AM:NIP-1 case. )

re

1, To work out in cooperation with the CI and CA staffs what
¢an be done in the event it o:ay be useful at son:e future date to
publicize AMMUG-I's defection by releasing certain information to
the press or by possibiy having hin. eppear before the Crganiszation
of Anerican States,

3. The above represents a general outline of what our overall
planning has beén in connection with the Ai.A:UG-I case since we
brought him to the United States, The role of Wi/SA/C1 as | under-
stand it is to manage and coordinate the overall aspects of the
operation and to ee that no unilateral action 1s taken by any one
interested desk or office that nay have dan.aying affects on other
aspects of the operation.
