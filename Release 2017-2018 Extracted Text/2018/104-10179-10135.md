MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

~y

1, I did not have the opportunity to discuss many Cuban
probloms with Manolo RAY during the period 4-13 June in both
San Juan and Paris, Our meetings were largely devoted to the
effort of contacting and attempting to recruit or cause the
defection of Carlos FRANQUI, The following, however, are the

conclusions of my brief effort to discuss the genera

with RAY,

2, Manolo RAY's Attitude Towards KUBARK:

{ situation

It has become

obvious to me on this second meeting with Manolo RAY that:

a. RAY is convinced that the Agency had in the past
purposely and actively attempted to destroy him as a
political leader, In this connection, RAY feels that the
Agency, following the Bay of Pigs invasion, was partially
responsible for the break up of the MRP clandestine net-
work and resistance potential in and out of Cuba, RAY
stated that he has proof of the participation of at least
one KUBARK officer in a plot with certain MRP officials to
remove him from the MRP as a condition for KUBARK's
assistance to that organization, RAY added that the

He either did not

know or could not recall the individual's name or pre-

officer in question has been fired.

ferred not to mention it,

b, On the strength and position of the State White
Paper on Cuba prior to the Bay of Pigs, RAY's MRP joined
the FRD (later the CRC), While his organization was &
membor of the FRD, the attention of KUBARK and the U. 8.
Government was called time and time again. By the FRD

3, RAY told me that he felt 1t possible to speak in a
completely frank manner with me. J urged him to do so,
stressing that only in such an atmosphere was there any hope
of our eventually arriving at some constructive understanding.
I attempted to assure RAY that our motives were never sinister,
that every action we have ever taken was based on a need to use
those instruments which promised most in our effort to free
Cuba. He replied that he believed that this might be an honest
Statement on my part, but that I could not Speak for the past
potions of certain individuala. At this poist I told him that
ne had many friends in our Agency as well as in the U.S,
Government, but that naturally there were people who believed
him to be too far to the left. I also stressed that our
assistance to anyone could not be a one-way street, and I
xeminded him that I made the same point to him is our first
meeting almost a year ago. I pointed out that we naturally
york best with those who cooperate. I told him of our need
for intelligence, not with any desire to xnoe all the secrets
of his organization and its political plans, but with the end
of gaining that knowledge which could help in more quickly
ee rtRE freedom and democracy to Cuba. Toward the end of
this phase of our discussion, I askec RAY if he would be willing
to give us the intelligence product of his activities inside
Cuba if we were, in turn, to give him certais material support,

His reply was an emphatic yes.

of resistance materials and supplies inside Cuba. I commented
xistence of individuals
inside Cuba to receive them. RAY did not respond to this comment,
leading me to believe from previous conversations that it would
probably be some time before he is willing to trust us with the
knowledge of his assets inside Cuba, Naturally I also concluded

c. fhe JURE represents a group of men of unquestioned
integrity, intelligence, organizational ability, or general
competence to run a free Cuba in the tradition of the

revolution.

d. The JURE has a seuse of timing, the patience that
must go with this, and an appreciation of the need to
create a truly Cuba "mistique" in a movement to fight for
the liberation of Cuba. (In this connection, it is
important to note that RAY did not, and would not, expose
himself to an effort against FRANQUI without some assurance
of success. He stated openly that it would ill-becone
him to associate himself with failure.)

. @. The JURE, when they have the logistical support in
place and ready for use, will have the personnel ready.
This was clearly implied but not actually stated. RAY
stated that no purpose would be served, except to expose
those who will assist them, by engaging in clandestine
activities that do not have the necessary material and

logistical support.

5. While we covered various aspects of the above ground
from different angles and I reiterated again the fact that
cooperation is a two-way street which RAY acknowledged in
seemingly sincere tones; he was completely forthright in stating
that whereas they needed assistance and would gladly take it,
they have always been refused it and in essence the time has
passed to ask, for without it or not, their role and goal are
clear and in one manner or another they will succeed.

6. Recommendation for Future Relations with RAY (JURE):

&. RAY cannot be overlooked in the struggle for Cuban
freedom; of all the Cubans I have net, he is the most
purposeful, methodical, as well asthe most experienced

KUBARE with all manner of intelligence derived from JURE

d. The'assistance to RAY and coatact with him should

because of operational Iimitarions (false identity
