Police) has furnished the following information: ~

A check of the records available through TWA Airways
in Frankfurt/Main, West Germany, failed to. reveal any information,
indicating’ that SUZANNE FUEGER arrived by TWA from New York between
May 12 and May 19, 1965. No passengerg# lists are maintained on the
local flights of Lufthansa between Frankfurt/Main and Munich, *
Germany, and therefore no record on FUEGER could be located for
travel between these points. Further, FUEGER has not ee ye
at any hotel in Munich. : ‘ .

Inquiries in Munich have revealed that FUEGER's mother,
ELSE ROSE FUEGER, sold her house in the village of Riederau for a
sum of 40,000 Marks, and purchased a flat at 12 Martha-Braeustrasse ,|
| Fuerstenfeldbruck, West Germany. This is a town in the immediate
vicinity of Munich.

of.Mrs. FUEGER, were residing with her in the house in Riederau,

in : and as of May 18, 1965, were still in the house, although they
os planned to move shortly to Nuernberg, West Germany. The inquiries
r indicated that the. sale of the house led to quarrels in the family.
