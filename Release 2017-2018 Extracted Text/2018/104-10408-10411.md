employed by the Cuban Embassy if Mexico who provided CIE]
assistance to OSWALD in his attempts to obtain a Cuban 4

The Government of Mexico (GOM) did arrest and interrogate H
DURAN re her connection with OSWALD, and a copy of the
GOM deposition appears in the Repor The deposition was
turned over to the Commission by the GOM via State Department.
Since. knowledge of DURAN's contact with OSWALD originally

rapped in an eftort to disguise the place where the
phéto had been taken. The photo became somewhat of an
issue when the Warren Commission decided it belonged :
in the Report as part of the exhibits since it had been
shown to the OSWALDs. The Agency finally allowed the
picture to appear in the report with the background
completely blocked out and with the agreement that no
mention would be made about where it had been taken. S
As far as can be determined, the Agency has never

admitted publicly that the photo was taken in Mexico,

even though there has been a great deal of speculation

to that effect by several authors and journalists. As

a matter of fact, one of the lawyers who worked with the
Commission later leaked information to an author regarding

the photo, but erroneously said it had been taken in

front of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico by CIA. Still,

the Agency has not revealed the. actual location, only

saying it was taken somewhere outside the U.S, All

mention of the photo has therefore been marked to be

withheld, because of sensitive sources and methods

involved.

c.. Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte. ALVARADO, a 2
Nicaraguan citizen, walked in to the U.S, Embassy in
Mexico, claiming'to have knowledge re Kennedy's assasination.
It was learned that ALVARADO was an agent for the Nicaraguan
Intelligence Service (NIS), however his story re the |
assassination was separate from his work for the NIS.: After
lengthy interrogation, including a polygraph, it was
determined that ALVARADO. had been fabricating a story claiming 4
he had seen OSWALD receive money from a Cuban official at
the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. The ALVARADO story: appears
in the Warren Report.but it does not reveal his identity. In
order to continue to protect ALVARADO and the Nicaraguan
government from possible embarrassment all mention.of
ALVARADO has been. marked for non-release.

2, A list and copies of douments from the OSWALD file :
have “been forwarded to your office for review by other LA
branches and possibly other Divisions. The documents are. marked i
according to which volume they belong in the 201 file (there
are. 57 volumes plus fnany)bulky atachments.)

3. During the review, it was necessary several times to
refer to the Warren Report and the exhibits to ascertain
exactly what was already known about the Mexican aspect of the
case, It is doubtful that the other branches will find this
necessary, but in case they do, the Warren Report is held
in the Library.
