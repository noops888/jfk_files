The Government of Mexico (GOM) did arrest and interrogate

DURAN re her connection with OSWALD, and a copy of the

GOM deposition appears in the Report.

The deposition was

turned over. to the Commission by the GOM via State Department.

When news cf the

the Station immediately forwarded copies of the photo

to the FBI in the mistaken assumption that the photo

of OSWALD taken while he was in Mexico

The photo became somewhat of an

•Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte.

ALVARADO, a

Nicaraguan citizen, walked in to the U.S. Embassy in

claiming to have knowledge 're Kennedy's assasination.

Mexico learned that ALVARADO was an agent for the Nicaraguan

Intelligence service (als), however his story re the

assassination was separate

from his work for the NIS.'.After

lengthy interrogation, including a polygraph, it was

determined that ALVARADO. had been fabricating a story claiming

he had seen OSWALD receive money from a Cuban official at

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

The ALVARADO story appears

in the Warren Report but it

does not reveal his identity.

In

order to continue to protect ALVARADO and the Nicaraguan

government from possible embarrassment all mention of

ALVARADO has been marked for non-release.

A list and copies of douments from the OSWALD file

have been forwarded

to your office for review by other LA

branches and possibly other Divisions.

The documents are marked

according to which volume they belong in the 201 file (there.

are. 57 volumes plus many bulky atachments.)

During the review, it was necessary several times to
