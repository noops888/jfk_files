MEMORANDUM FOR DCIARO
ee

DATE: April/May 1997
SUBJECT: Proposed Topics/Questions for DCI Office Briefings to ARRB
FROM: DC/DCVER

ACTION TAKEN: Since documents in this timeframe were not logged into a searchable
system, AARC keyword and visual shelf list searchs were utilized. Executive Registry has
identified seven (7) shelf lists containing documents during the referenced timeframe (60’s
to mid-70’s):

80M01009A
80M01048A
-80R01284A
80B01285A
80R01580R
80B01676R
80RO1731R.

Each question was treated as a separate search effort with appropriate keyword and
AARC shelf list searches/reviews. Due to the timeframe, many of the applicable boxes are
being utilized by historians at the present time (shelf lists are annotated accordingly). As
of 30 April thrity-three (33) boxes of documents have been recalled/reviewed.

indexed?

: How are the r CI

Answer 1: The records which pass through Executive Registry are incorporated into our
subjectitopic files. Front Office working files which are turned over to the registry as a
DCIDDCIIEXDIR leaves the position are categorized by material type; i.e.,
calendars/cards, meetings, trips, chronos, etc. High level weekly meetings are
categorized by agency name: NSC, STATE, DEFENSE, ATTORNEY GENERAL, etc.

Question 2: In a Cold Warrior foomote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Cl Staff

13-00000

m8

Answer 2: The keywords ANGLETON & KALARIS were utilized in this search; plus
through the perusal of shelflists a folder with DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION was
reviewed. The folder with “destruction” in the title contained paramaters set for
retention of documents during the various investigations/committees. None of the reviews
surfaced any authorization or reference to or listing of Angleton documents being
destroyed. If the timeframe for the said destruction were provided and the position held
by Kalaris were known, the appropriate DCI Chronos and position liaison files could be
searched.

Question 3: Which office controls the unredacted version of the Family Jewels memo?

Answer 3: Executive Registry shelf lists record two (2) retired boxes containing material
identifiable as “Family Jewels”. At the present time those two boxes are being utilized
by the DCIIRO for the Levy search. (79M01476A; boxes 16 & 17). One of the testimony
documents located in a folder titled “White House Correpsondence re: Congressional
Investigations” referenced the “Family Jewels”. Per a conversation with DCIIRO on
30 April 1997, the GC has found the unredacted version.

Answer 4: The shelf lists for the above timeframe did not indicate high level meetings
with either of the two agencies, therefore, the NSA and FBI liaison folders for 196311964
were reviewed. There were no responsive documents in these compartments. The
McCone files are under review by David Borage.

Answer §: No memos re Kennedy were found in DDCI/Walters files for'1963/64: The
DCVIRO has tasked this out through the CMS/IMO. The DCI/McCone filéS-afe under
review by David Borage.

uestion 6: Where ar: yersonal and workin. TS ie Di hi
of the directorates? (Personal files, soft files, and official files are included in this request.)

Answer 6: During the early retirement years AO/DCI did retire a number of soft files. =
Some DCI files contained records labeled as “Personal” . Executive Registry holdings of
personal correspondence would be maintained as temporary to be retained within the
registry for three years then destroyed. No Official Files were noted on shelf lists.

Question 7: Are there any Agency records on George Herbert Walker Bush prior to his
appoi. is DCI?


13-00000

Answer 7: Bush was appointed as DCI on 3 November 1975. Earlier Career:

- 1974-1975, Chief, U.S. Liaison Office, People’s Republic of China
- 1973-1974, Chairman, Republican National Committee

- 1971-1972, Ambassador to the United Nations

- 1967-1971, Member of Congress, 7th District, Texas

- Servid in World War II as naval naviator in the Pacific.

BUSH was run as a keyword and no documents revealed evidence of any correspondence
prior to his appointment as DCI. Navy liaison files from 1963-66 were reviewed with no
responsive documents.

assassination?

Answer 8: Helms was DCI from 30 June 1966 through 2 February 1973. The Bay of
Pigs material is presently under review at the History Staff. The tasking memo from the
DCI to the DD’s stating that the CIA will not involve itself in assassinations. The
DCI/IRO stated that she has the “1967 IG Report”. The Helms files were recalled by
Chris Burgess for Helms use.

juestion 9: How are White House re recorded, mi.
requests from the then Attorney General Robert Kennedy?

Answer 9: White House requests would initially be filed in Liaison with the White House
for the year that the request was received. It might also be transferred to or cross-
referenced to a topic file if significance warrented it. (The Kennedy was Attorney
General from 1961-1964.) ‘Attorney General labeled folders were recalled and reviewed.
The following correspondence from Attorney General Robert Kennedy resides in
Executive Registry files:

- Memo to Heads of Departments and Agencies re NSA Memorandum 161 ensuring the
development of plans, programs & action proposals to protect internal security.

EES S
- Memo of acknowledgement of the appointment of John A. Ross as Deputy for National
Intelligence Programs.

- Proposed Revision of NSC-5427 re restructing Soviet Diplomat access to U.S. Strategic
Intelligence.

- Our response to a verbal request for information re the Cuban refugee situation in
Maini.

- Verbal & Paper requests re NIE on Weapons of Mass Destruction.


13-00000

- Query re interrogation of members of 2506 Brigade in Miami by Dept. of the Army
- Memo of accolade for the efforts of Mike Kiskowsky in the Cuban Rescue Effort
- Section 7 alien residence request.

- Our notification of Swiss/Soviet confrontation of Nosenko at the Washington District
Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service wiCIA present plus appreciation for
Commissioner Farrell & staff's assistance in the above effort.

Question 10: How are records kept of presidential briefings from the CIA (either the
I's office or irect ?_ What Di i ill exii e

period August 1, 1963 to February 1, 1964?

Answer 10:

If the ODCI briefed the Office of the President, then there would be a briefing book with
any background material and notes in the folders retired for that DCI’s term.

If the briefing were to be given by another directorate, it should have been filed on a
temporary basis within the ER files and not retired.

The following briefing books during that timeframe were located in our records:

1DEC63 - Key Elements of Soviet Military & Economic Strengths
(1284A/10)
DCI (McCone) Meetings with the President (Johnson) 3 folders
(1285A/5-6).

from the Mexico City Station during LHO’s visit.”

Answer 11: Warren Commission folder holds a document to David BerlinIEXDIR/WC
stating that Mexico City Station did take photographs. Hill briefing on Oswald indicating
that we were not surveilling him at the time of his visit to Mexico City. The McCone files
have recently been recalled by history staff. Thus far in the efforts of this search, I have
not located any reference to DCI taskings to the directorates.

Answer 12: I saw no reference to Agency liaisons in the files searched.


Answer 13: Dulles served on the Warren Commission from 1963-64, and McCone was
DCI from 1961-65. In scanning the correspondence, it appears that the memos were from
the Commission to the Agency, not person to person.

estion 14:_What records might still exist of communications between Allen Dulles and
ig.
yone. at ission?

Answer 14: We hold Warren Commission material from 1963-1975. Dulles served on
the Warren Commission from 1963-1964. . In scanning the correspondence, it appears
that the memos were from the Commission to the Agency, not person to person.

Answer 15: | did not see any staffing lists for the Warren Commission.

Question 16: What records exist in the Executive Registery on Operation Mongoose or
the Special Group Augmented?

Answer 16: The Executive registry holds one file folder titled “MONGOOSE Cuban
Reconnaissance/Overflights” dated September 9, 1962 through May 31, 1963. The box
containing this folder has been signed out by history staff (Diane/Jim) since February 27,
1996. Within the Rockefeller Committee folders,(1048A/9) I found a document from OSD
requesting that all documents in the CIA pertaining to Operation Mongoose be transferred
to the officer currently responsible for the operations covering Cuba (dated 28JAN63)
plus a package of MONGOOSE Meeting MFR’s and background documentation
requested by the IG in Nov 1975.

i) How are the records of the DCI, DDCI, and the heads of
the directorates indexed? What records are kept?

OCA keeps all correspondence, of substance, to and from
Congress. Their files are indexed by subject matter or by
Committee. (ie if something came in from SSCI re something
general, they may have filed it in a folder named SSCI.

2) Nothing for OCA

3) Which office controls the unredacted version of the
Family Jewels memo?

Had some folder level hits on the search terms “review” and
“staff”. In those files, their was 6 folders that contained
the term “jewels files’.

4) Nothing for OCA

5) Nothing for OCA

6) According to our RCS, independent office head’s working
and personal papers are destroyed.

SUBJECT: Query - -ARRB #17

17. What records might still exist of conversations or communications
between DCI and Cl Staff Chief James Angleton on Nosenko?

We can only address from perspective of Office of DCI and the records are

office to office communications, written records. ER has searched those folders
identified as holding Nosenko material. Of this material, three. memoranda between
the O/DCI and C/CI date from the time Angleton .was Chief/Cl. The memos are from
1969 and 71. Most of the other memoranda are from 1977-1978 and some

of these relate to HSCA requests for information and testimony relating to Nosenko.

Attached is a draft of ARRB proposed topics, etc. for
the DCI Briefings. A number of the questions rélate to
ongoing requests, either formal (CIA 1-16) or informal (CIA
IR 1-19). I have annotated the list to indicate the request
number. We should receive this week a status memo on
“requests for additional information and records” from .the
ARRB staff. I will fax you a copy.

If you feel a question is unreasonable or beyond the
scope, or you are not sure what they are asking, give me a
call. I don't want any one doing unnecessary work.

I sent a copy directly tq oGc, since

Fax:
Date: April 30, 1997
Pages: 1, including this cover sheet.

Could you please add this to the list of questions for the DCI Briefing to be held on 08 May

1997?

Thank you for your assistance.

“We are interested in locating a series of correspondence between the CIA, Office of the General
Counsel and the Department of Justice, Assistant Attorney General during the late 1962-1963
time period. Would these documents be easily retrievable through a check of OGC
correspondence chron files (if such files exist)?”

(This question is based on our discovery of a number of isolated letters, from A.A.G. J. Walter
Yeagley and CLA GC Lawrence Houston in late, 1962 and early 1963 regarding the CIA’s interest
in certain Cuban exile groups. A copy of one of these letters is attached.)

5. What records would be kept of DCI tasking to other intelligence
community agencies in the immediate wake of the assassination (first
month).

Records of DCI tasking to other intelligence agencies could
exist in various records. Within ER, high level meeting files with respective
agencies (if any) and liaison folders must be reviewed. As was just merfoned,
NSA and FBI folders have been reviewed and no responsive document®
located. That applies to this question as well. In addition, DCI chrono files
could contain references to tasking and are being reviewed. It should also be

noted that the DDO is (and historically has been) responsible for liaison

with the FBI. [One other but less likely possibility would be the DI Collection
Guidance Staff.]

There is also a formal requirements mechanism with respect to collection
tasking. These would be in the records of the Deputy to the DCI for National
Intelligence Programs Evaluation (established Sept. 1963). Predecessor to
IC. [NIPE records are being reviewed in part to address ARRB request 8.]
Files involving memoranda to/from DCI, meetings with DCI, action
memoranda and minutes of Critical Collection Problems Committee
meetings have been reviewed; no records indicatirig DCI tasking collection

have been located.
