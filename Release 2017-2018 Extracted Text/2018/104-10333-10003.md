MEMORANDUM FOR DCI/IRO

THRU:

C/DCI/ER

Sop

DATE:

SUBJECT:

FROM:

April/May 1997

Proposed Topics/Questions for DCI Office Briefings to ARR

DC/DCI/ER

ACTION TAKEN: Since documents in this timeframe were not logged into a searchable

system, AARC keyword and visual shelf list searchs were utilized. Executive Registry has

identified seven (7) shelf lists containing documents during the referenced timeframe (60's

to mid-70's):

80M01009A

80M01048A

80R01284A

80B01285A

80R01580R

80B01676R

80R01731R

Each question was treated as a separate search effort with appropriate keyword and

AARC shelf list searches/reviews. Due to the timeframe, many of the applicable boxes are

being utilized by historians at the present time (shelf lists are annotated accordingly). As

of 30 April thrity-three (33) boxes of documents have been recalled/reviewed.

Question 1: How are the records of the DCI, DDCI and the heads of the directorates

indexed?

Answer 1: The records which pass through Executive Registry are incorporated into our

subject/topic files. Front Office working files which are turned over to the registry as a

DCI/DDCI/EXDIR leaves the position are categorized by material type; i.e.,

calendars/cards, meetings, trips, chronos, etc. High level weekly meetings are

categorized by agency name: NSC, STATE, DEFENSE, ATTORNEY GENERAL, etc.

Question 2: In a Cold Warrior footnote, Tom Mangold reports that as any of Cl Staff

Chief James Angleton's files were destroyed, "a complete record was carefully maintained

about what had been done. (George) Kalaris signed off on every file and the DCI's office

was notified. (p. 143) What records would the DCI's office have maintained on this

destruction"

---

## Page 6

13-00000

Answer 2: The keywords ANGLETON & KALARIS were utilized in this search; plus

through the perusal of shelflists a folder with DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION was

reviewed. The folder with "destruction" in the title contained paramaters set for

retention of documents during the various investigations/committees. None of the reviews

surfaced any authorization or reference to or listing of Angleton documents being

destroyed. If the timeframe for the said destruction were provided and the position held

by Kalaris were known, the appropriate DCI Chronos and position liaison files could be

searched.

Question 3: Which office controls the unredacted version of the Family Jewels memo?

Answer 3: Executive Registry shelf lists record two (2) retired boxes containing material

identifiable as "Family Jewels"

. At the present time those two boxes are being utilized

by the DCIIRO for the Levy search. (79M01476A; boxes 16 & 17). One of the testimony

documents located in a folder titled "White House Correpsondence re: Congressional

Investigations" referenced the "Family Jewels". Per a conversation with DCHIRO on

30 April 1997, the GC has found the unredacted version.

Question 4; What records would be kept of requests to or liaison between the Agency

and NSA or FBI in the wake of the assassination (November 23. 1963-September 30,

1964?

Answer 4: The shelf lists for the above timeframe did not indicate high level meetings

with either of the two agencies, therefore, the NSA and FBI liaison folders for 1963/1964

were reviewed. There were no responsive documents in these compartments. The

McCone files are under review by David Borage.

Question 5: What records would be kept of DCI tasking to other intelligence community

agencies in the immediate wake of the assassination (the first month)?

Answer 5: No memos re Kennedy were found in DDCI/Walters files for 1963/64. The

DCI/IRO has tasked this out through the CMS/IMO. The DCI/McCone files are under

review by David Borage.

Question 6: Where are the personal and working papers of the DCI. DDCI, and the heads

of the directorates? (Personal files, soft files, and official files are included in this request.)

Answer 6: During the eurly retirement years AOIDC! did retire a number of soft files.

Some DCI files contained records labeled as "Personal". Executive Registry holdings of

personal correspondence would be maintained as temporary to be retained within the

registry for three years then destroyed. No Official Files were noted on shelf lists.

Question 7: Are there any Agency records on George Herbert Walker Bush prior to his

appointment as DCI?

---

## Page 7

13-00000

Answer Z: Bush was appointed as DCI on 3 November 1975. Earlier Career:

- 1974-1975, Chief, U.S. Liaison Office, People's Republic of China

- 1973-1974, Chairman, Republican National Committee

- 1971-1972, Ambassador to the United Nations

- 1967-1971. Member of Congress, 7th District, Texas

- Servid in World War II as naval naviator in the Pacific.

BUSH was run as a keyword and no documents revealed evidence of any correspondence

prior to his appointment as DCI. Navy liaison files from 1963-66 were reviewed with no

responsive documents.

Question 8: What records might still exist on correspondence between the DCI (Helms)

and the Nixon White House on the 1967 IG Report? on the Bay of Pigs? on the

assassination?

Answer 8: Helms was DCI from 30 June 1966 through 2 February 1973. The Bay of

Pigs material is presently under review at the History Staff. The tasking memo from the

DCI to the DD's stating that the CIA will not involve itself in assassinations. The

DCI/IRO stated that she has the "1967 IG Report". The Helms files were recalled by

Chris Burgess for Helms use.

Question 9: How are White House requests recorded. What records might there be of

requests from the then Attorney General Robert Kennedy?

Answer 9: White House requests would initially be filed in Liaison with the White House

for the year that the request was received. It might also be transferred to or cross-

referenced to a topic file if significance warrented it. (The Kennedy was Attorney

General from 1961-1964. Attorney General labeled folders were recalled and reviewed.

The following correspondence from Attorney General Robert Kennedy resides in

Executive Registry files:

- Memo to Heads of Departments and Agencies re NSA Memorandum 161 ensuring the

development of plans, programs & action proposals to protect internal security.

BROSS

- Memo of acknowledgement of the appointment of John A. Ross as Deputy for National

Intelligence Programs.

- Proposed Revision of NSC-5427 re restructing Soviet Diplomat access to U.S. Strategic

Intelligence.

- Our response to a verbal request for information re the Cuban refugee situation in

Muini.

- Verbal & Puper requeses re ME on Weupons of Mass Destruction.

## Page 8

13-00000

- Query re interrogation of members of 2506 Brigade in Miami by Dept. of the Army

- Memo of accolade for the efforts of Mike Kiskowsky in the Cuban Rescue Effort

- Section 7 alien residence request.

- Our notification of Swiss/Soviet confrontation of Nosenko at the Washington District

Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service w/CIA present plus appreciation for

Commissioner Farrell & stuff's assistance in the above effort.

Question 10: How are records kept of presidential briefings from the CIA (either the

DCI's office or one of the directorates)? What DCI briefing papers still exist for the

period August 1, 1963 to February 1, 1964?

Answer 10:

If the ODCI briefed the Office of the President, then there would be a briefing book with

any background material and notes in the folders retired for that DCI's term.

If the briefing were to be given by another directorate, it should have been filed on a

temporary basis within the ER files and not retired.

The following briefing books during that timeframe were located in our records:

1DEC63 - Key Elements of Soviet Military & Economic Strengths

(1284A/10)

DCI (McCone) Meetings with the President (Johnson) 3 folders

(1285A/5-6).

Question 1l: What records might still exist on any McCone requests for information from

the directorates following the assassination? For example, any request on the surveillance

from the Mexico City Station during LHO's visit

Answer Il: Warren Commission folder holds a document to David Berlin/ EXDIR/WC

stating that Mexico City Station did take photographs. Hill briefing on Oswald indicating

that we were not surveilling him at the time of his visit to Mexico City. The McCone files

have recently been recalled by history staff. Thus far in the efforts of this search, I have

not located any reference to DCI taskings to the directorates.

Question 12: Who were the Agency liaisons with Robert Kennedy prior to and after the

assassination?

Answer 12: I saw no reference to Agency liaisons in the files searched.

Question 13: What records still exist of communications between DCI McCone and

Allen Dulles during the Warren Commission:

Answer 13: Dulles served on the Warren Commission from 1963-64, and McCone was

DCI from 1961-65. In scanning the correspondence, it appears that the memos were from

the Commission to the Agency, not person to person.

Question 14: What records might still exist of communications between Allen Dulles and

anyone at ClA during the Warren Commission?

Answer 14: We hold Warren Commission material from 1963-1975. Dulles served on

the Warren Commission from 1963-1964. In scanning the correspondence, it appears

that the memos were from the Commission to the Agency, not person to person.

Question 15: Did CIA have anyone on the Warren Commission staff (either an Agency

officer of a source)?

Answer 15: I did not see any staffing lists for the Warren Commission.

Question 16: What records exist in the Executive Registery on Operation Mongoose or

the Special Group Augmented"?

Answer 16: The Executive registry holds one file folder titled "MONGOOSE Cuban

Reconnaissance/Overflights" dated September 9, 1962 through May 31, 1963. The box

containing this folder has been signed out by history staff (Diane/Jim) since February 27,

1996. Within the Rockefeller Committee folders, (1048A/9) I found a document from OSD

requesting that all documents in the CLA pertaining to Operation Mongoose be transferred

to the officer currently responsible for the operations covering Cuba (dated 28JAN63)

plus a package of MONGOOSE Meeting MFR's and background documentation

requested by the IG in Nov 1975.

Question 17: What records might still exist of conversations or communications between

the DCI and Cl Staff Chief James Angleton on Nosenko?

Answer 17: Seven (7) folders have been identified as holding Nosenko material. The

following records of information re Nosenko between the DCI and C/CI residing in

Executive Registry files are as follon's:

- CI 78-131 "Talking Points for the Director's Meeting with Yurily Ivanovich Nosenko"

- CI 78-406 "Transmittal of Letter from Nosenko"

SUBJECT: Query - ARRB #17

17. What records might still exist of conversations or communications

between DCI and Cl Staff Chief James Angleton on Nosenko?

We can only address from perspective of Office of DCI and the records are

office to office communications, written records. ER has searched those folders

identified as holding Nosenko material. Of this material, three memoranda between

the O/DCI and C/Cl date from the time Angleton was Chief/Cl. The memos are from

1969 and 71. Most of the other memoranda are from 1977-1978 and some

of these relate to HSCA requests for information and testimony relating to Nosenko.

Kathy,

Attached is a draft of ARRB proposed topics, etc. for

the DCI Briefings.

A number of the questions relate to

ongoing requests, either formal (CIA 1-16) or informal (CIA

IR 1-19). I have

annotated the list to indicate the request

number.

We should receive this week a status memo on

"requests for additional information and records" from the

ARRB staff. I will fax you a copy.

If you feel a question is unreasonable or beyond the

scope, or you are not sure what they are asking, give me a

call. I don't want any one doing unnecessary work.

I sent a copy directly to

OGC, since

she is going on leave tomorrow.

COMMENTS:

Hello Barry.

Could you please add this to the list of questions for the DCI Briefing to be held on 08 May

1997?

Thank you for your assistance.

"We are interested in locating a series of correspondence between the CIA, Office of the General

Counsel and the Department of Justice, Assistant Attorney General during the late 1962-1963

time period. Would these documents be easily retrievable through a check of OGC

correspondence chron files (if such files exist)?"

(This question is based on our discovery of a number of isolated letters, from A.A.G. J. Walter

Yeagley and CIA GC Lawrence Houston in late, 1962 and early 1963 regarding the CLA's interest

in certain Cuban exile groups. A copy of one of these letters is attached.)

Query ARRB- -5

5. What records would be kept of DCI tasking to other intelligence

community agencies in the immediate wake of the assassination (first

month).

Records of DCI tasking to other intelligence agencies could

exist in various records. Within ER, high level meeting files with respective

agencies (if any) and liaison folders must be reviewed. As was just merfoned,

NSA and FBI folders have been reviewed and no responsive documents®

located. That applies to this question as well. In addition, DCI chrono files

could contain references to tasking and are being reviewed. It should also be

noted that the DDO is (and historically has been) responsible for liaison

with the FBI. [One other but less likely possibility would be the DI Collection

Guidance Staff.]

There is also a formal requirements mechanism with respect to collection

tasking. These would be in the records of the Deputy to the DCI for National

Intelligence Programs Evaluation (established Sept. 1963). Predecessor to

IC. [NIPE records are being reviewed in part to address ARRB request 8.)

NIPE Files involving memoranda to/from DCl, meetings with DCl, action

memoranda and minutes of Critical Collection Problems Committee

meetings have been reviewed; no records indicating DC| tasking collection

have been located.
