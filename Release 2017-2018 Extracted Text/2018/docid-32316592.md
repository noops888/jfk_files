MM T-1 is EVELIO ALPIZAR PEREZ, Key Source - Cuban.

Pursuant to Bureau instructions, a summary of :
information supplied by CIA is set forth in an accompanying i
letter. (un)

It is of interest to note that during this
investigation, GERALD PATRICK HEMMING advised that LUIS
SIERRA works for CIA; Dr. LEOPOLDO NUNEZ advised that
MEDINA claims to be working for CIA; CONSTANZO advised
that CANTILLO is working for CIA and that LUIS SIERRA
has been, and may still be, working for CIA. CANTILIO
himself denied, when interviewed, that he is working
for CIA. CIA, of course, admits that CANTILLO is working
for CIA and has complained that this investigation has
| resulted in his being "blown" as a CIA source. It,

therefore, appears doubtful that this alleged kidnapping
conspiracy would have ever been conceived without CIA. lu)
