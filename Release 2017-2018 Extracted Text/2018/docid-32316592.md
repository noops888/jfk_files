MM 97-488

SECRET

MM I-I IS EVELIO ALPIZAR PEREZ, Key Source - Cuban.

Pursuant to Bureau instructions, a summary of

information supplied by CIA is set forth in an accompanying

letter.

(S)(4)

It is of interest to note that during this

investigation, GERALD PATRICK HEMMING advised that LUIS

SIERRA works for CIA; Dr. LEOPOLDO NUNEZ advised that

MEDINA claims to be working for CIA; CONSTANZO advised

that CANTILLO is working for CIA and that LUIS SIERRA

has been, and may still be, working for CIA. CANTILLO

himself denied,

when interviewed, that he is working

for CIA. CIA,

of course, admits

that CANTILLO is working

for CIA and has complained that this investigation has

resulted in his being "blown" as a CIA source.

It,

therefore,

appears doubtful that this alleged

kidnapping

conspiracy would have ever been conceived without CIA.
