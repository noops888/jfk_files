OLENVY will be advised, :Sinos my cable of yesterday (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above) ths:¢ heve
been three! principal developments: 1). Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1839 hrs lest evening called
DORTIGOS of Cuba. Jn this conversation, which like the first is taped, DORTICOS expressed
continued concern oyer possibility that Mexi police pea interrogated Silvia about mozey.
2) ALVARADO, the Nilo, ‘wes questioned by CAS officer! until two a.m, this morning, This
i officer was impressed by: ALVARADO who hes offered make himself available as a witness and
i i* who is now' hiding in place provided by: CAS.| We'cannot guarentee ALVARADO's safety. Wealth
{ i of detail ALVARADO gives about evants gnd personalities involved with OSWALD in Cub kub
- is striking. 3). At 1215 hrs. ext time 27 Nov. J CAS| officer was admised by phone by
ECHEVERRIA! that he . lad, arrested |Slivie today ‘because he learned she was attempting to

126, 27 Nov.

| leave ‘Next! for Hel ‘| However, Rohe verrisi later told LEGAT thet he had decided to :earrest

Silvia to avoid. any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable as

|. witness, Since we had veoeived ag reply to yesterday's telegrem.(MEXI 7072 - var.. '’ above)

i we have not requested Mexi gov to take! g any action against Silvia except to maintain

H increased surveillance of her, activities, Echeverri later denied to LEGAT that he led any
. specifioe opnerete evidence that she was about tq leaye for Cuba. We do. not now know which

| Echeverria} statements are accurate, | It is quite possible, and even probable, that ccntra-

| dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play down importance

| -of OSWALD visit, here, Mexi line still|is thet OSWALD visit related solely to visa question,

Consistent |with this Echeverria stated; to LEGAT ‘that |DORTICOS only interested in finding
out whether Mexi authorities tried to pay e story fran Silvia. This is obviously incrorrect
interpretation .|- Neither!LOPEZ Mateor nor Echeverria‘ know of ALVARADO's story. Pls rote
thet according Echeverria Silvia is being taken to Attorney General's office to whick

Mexi press has easy ‘access, Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be discounted. 4) {2

thet she was leaving Mexi to go to Zijuatenejo. Source doss not believe she was in Puerto
Vallarta, nor thet she is presently in Zijuatenejo. / BERSTEIN-also told source that she had
been questioned in Detroit, prior to her departure for Mexi, by the RCMP, but that no inquiry
had been made .of her by the FBI or any U.S. police or investigative agency. The interroga-
tion had to do with the FPFCC, its activities in the Detroit area, and the fact that she had
reportedly acted as a mail drop for Canadien communists, “This interrogation took place in
