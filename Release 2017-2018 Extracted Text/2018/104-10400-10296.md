OSWALD entering the Soviet or Cuban Enbassy.
3+ The search did reveal more data\from technical operations,
hovever. ‘This information, [vhich comes in in great masses,|had not
been previously associated with OSWALD because his name is not
actually mentioned in it, but the subject matter shows it is about
him, and our expert monitor says the voice is identical with the
voice of 1 October mova to be OSWALD's |
4. This further \technicall information covers[a round-robin of]
\felephone calis and| visite which OSWALD made to the Soviet and Cuban
Enbassies in Mexico City between 27 September and 3 October 1963.
‘This has been supplemented by reports on his travel in and out of Mexico

obtained by the U. 8. Consulate in the border town of Nuevo Laredo from

* Mexican Immigration Service records.

5. In brief, all this information shovs that Lee Harvey OSWALD
entered Mexico (apparently by car) at Nuevo Laredo on 26 Septenber
"1963, claiming he was © photographer, living in New Orleans end bound
for Mexico City. On 27 Septenber he was in Mexico City[phoning the]
\Boviet Enbassy|to ask for a visa 20 he could go to Odessa, USSR. On
28 September, he was at the Cuban Enbassy,|and Silvia DURAN, a Mexican
Employee of the Cuban Embassy, telephoned the Soviet Embassy about his
problem] It seems that osvatn (whose name is not nentioned)] wanted e
Cuban transit visa so he could go to Cuba and wait there for a Soviet

vise vhich vould permit him and bis wife to go on to the Soviet
Union. [Sitvie DURAN asked assurance that the Fussians vould grant
him the viea. A while later a Soviet official calle Silvie DURAN
back end explains that the visa applicant hed been dealing with
the Soviet Consulate in Washington about the same matter and that
they could not be sure that he would ever get the Soviet visa.
The Soviet official edded that the applicant had a letter showing
he belonged to an organization in favor of Cuba. Silvia DURAN and

" the Soviet official agree to table the matter. |

apparently a forvarding address vhere he can be reached. ‘here is | |
