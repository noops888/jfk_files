offered this information as his biggest ‘reason to think
-that there.is no “organization,” "syndicate," "major -
operating rackets" or whatever it might be called, presently’
operating in Santa Maria or vicinity, because TORNELLO would

newspapers. Further, that HENSON. indicated he was being
packed by, the. "group in: Santa Barbara," but that HENSON

also. indicated that’ he would not stand large losses, which

large increase in all. types. of crimes*in: Santa: Maria during

To the Kefauver Committee, one interest tha,
GREENBERG revealed was real estate at San Bernardino/
California, owned by "Store Properties, Inc." This’was
named as part of a larger complex of real eatate groperties
in which GREENBERG "and other unsavory characters" were ~
involved, and figuring in Store Properties was/again,

PAUL ZIFFREN L.

Heading Store Properties, Inc. as president
was SAMUEL GENIS, now dead, who had been _Anvolved in four
bankruptcies and ‘had been arrested for passing bad checks.
He had vaulted "with curious ease" inte control of multi-
million-dollar hotel and office-building holdings. When
he died in 1955 in ap accident, "his’estimated four-million-
dollar estate dwindled mysteriously. " ZIFFREN, said :
VELIE, had supplied cash to GENIS/for Store Properties,
Inc., getting his money back in / wo years with rive per cent
interest and soon after,receiving title to a portion of the
property at San Bernardino. :

When VELIE asked, ZIFFREN about his business
association with men like (Gnderworld figure ALEX GREENBERG,
ZIFFREN reportedly said, /"I\don't believe in character
assassination, GREENBE wag honorabie in all the dealings
T had with him." VELIE!s comment on this retort is,

"This tolerant attitude toword,a man who, while assoclated
with ZIFFREN, was algo doing work for ruthless criminal .
gangs, poses a big question... \Even if he wants to, can
a man shed associations such as ZIFFREN has had?"

T- J the researcher whg provided material from
which the"Reader's Digest" piece wag draw, has written

of ZIFFREN: "He is a man of power with deep. roots in the
hoodlum world, socializing on the highest level for the
benefit of press and public, with call girls and gamblers
and the other denizens of the lower leyel when the camera
is closed," ‘This source credits ZIFFREN with building

a lasti pridge between the underworld\and the overworld,
linking /"the outright criminal with his killions of illicit
dollars’ to the acceptable businessman whose needs for
investment capital recognizes no moral or \physical
boundaries,"
