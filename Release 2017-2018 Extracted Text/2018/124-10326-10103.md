the symbol "Bureau Informant 100."

This information,

passed on to the Bureau.

Allen Dulles gave him authorization to

handle dissemination in

this matter.

field. This should be done since the Informant has been developing

information in recent months regarding the travel of U, S. citizens

Such travelers come from various parts of the
