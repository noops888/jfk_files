SECURITY INDOCTRINATION
AND
SECRECY OATH

Ihave been informed officially that the United States
Government is engaged in major technical programs to
collect intelligence. These programs are concerned with
overhead reconnaissance of denied areas using aircraft and
space vehicles and with the collection of intelligence based
on interception and decoding of foreign ciphers.

These programs are of vital importance to the
national security, and any disclosures of these activities will
endanger the intelligence sources. Official confirmation of
such activities, under other than very carefully controlled
circumstances, is precluded by present national policy,
despite any level of public speculation.

The Director of Central Intelligence, charged by
statute with the protection of intelligence sources and methods,
has prescribed security policies of compartmented controls
called:

ol

development and operations of overhead
reconnaissance equipment.
