Interview:. Robert Genzman,

Harold Leap, and Beth Lichtenfels

interviewed Richard E. Snyder, retired Foreign Service Officer,

on April 14, 1978, at the Committee offices.

The interview

yielded the following information:

Snyder was born on December 10, 1919. He served in the

Army from 1940 to 1946, and then attended Yale University, where

he received a degree and completed a year of graduate work. He

took the Foreign Service exam during his senior year of college,

passed the exam, and was placed on the waiting list for Foreign

Service assignments. He did not know anyone

who took the Foreign

Service exam when he did, and he did not know anyone else on the

Foreign Service waiting list.

In October 1949, Snyder was contacted by the Central In-

telligence Agency and was asked whether he desired employment

with the Agency. He was told that the State Department had cir-

culated its Foreign Service waiting list to the CIA. Although

he thought he would be called for State Department employment

within a year of so, and although he knew he would accept such

employment, he applied to the CIA primarily for financial rea-

sons, was accepted, and served from 1949 to 1950. Most of

his CIA

service consisted of training; he did little substan-

tive work for the Agency.

Snyder completely terminated his CIA employment and en-

tered the Foreign Service in 1950. He cannot recall any contact

with the CIA since 1950, aside from a letter which he sent to

the Agency

after he retired from the State Department circa

1970 to inquire about contract work possibilities. The CIA's

response was

negative.

Snyder has been in Military Intelligence and Military

Intelligence Reserve since the time of his active Army duty

(1940-1946) , although there has never been any connection be-

tween his State Department employment and his military posi-

tions. He is currently in inactive Military Intelligence Re-

serve.

Snyder served as a consular officer at the American Em-

bassy in Moscow from July 1959 to July 1961. When shown lists

of State Department personnel in Moscow for the years 1959 and

1960, he said

he could recognize no CIA personnel.

He did not

know who had been the CIA's Chief of Station in Moscow when

he served there. He said that the military attache people at

the Embassy may have been CIA employees, and that the travel

officer and the security officer named L'Angeli (phonetic) may

have been CIA employees. L'Angeli was once approached by the

Soviets for defection.

Snyder said Minister Counselor Edward I. Freers (de-

ceased) was not a CIA employee. He did not know whether John

A. McVickar, his colleaque in the consular office, was a CIA

employee. McVickar, who arrived in Moscow before Snyder and

departed after Snyder, worked with Snyder throughout his two-

year tour of duty in Moscow. Like L'Angeli, McVickar was once

approached by the Soviets for defection. Snyder said he never

told McVickar, whom he first met in 1959, that he (Snyder) had

once been a CIA employee. Snyder said that when asked by dan

Rather of CBS if he (Snyder) had been with the CIA, he replied

that in the Soviet Union he had been nothing other than what

he claimed to be.

Snyder said that when he testified before the

Warren Com-

mission, he was not asked whether he had ever been a CIA employee.

After he testified, he told Allen Dulles that he had once worked

for the Agency. Dulles did not show much interest.

snyder remembers that during his tour of duty in Moscow,

there came to his attention three defector cases--Robert Edward '

Webster, Nicholas Petrulli, and then Lee Harvey Oswald. On

october 28, 1959, just before Oswald defected, Snyder sent a let-

ter (C.E. 914) to the State Department requesting advice on hand-

ling cases of defection. Snyder said that this request was not

directed at any particular case.

Snyder first became aware of Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald

came to the embassy on October 31, 1959, to renounce his American

citizenship. He recalls that he and Oswald talked alone, al-

though McVickar was

in an adjoining office with the door open.

Snyder said that McVickar's claim that he was in the same room

may be correct, but that he (Snyder) cannot remember for certain.

Oswald appeared to be determined and "uptight," and he declined

to sit, although he probably did sit later. He gave Snyder a

note stating that he wanted to renounce his American citizenship.

He either

gave Snyder his passport or Snyder asked for it. Os-

wald said that he had been a radar operator in the Marine Corps,

and that he intended to give information he possessed to, the

Soviets. Snyder's response was to attempt to

delay any action

by Oswald and to get more information from Oswald. Oswald was

not talkative, but "humorless," and this meeting did not last

long--possibly one hour or so.

Snyder recalls that during this meeting Oswald did not

mention the specific military information which he possessed,

nor did he mention John F. Kennedy, political assassination, the

President of the United States, or Cuba. Oswald. did talk about

the imperialism of the United States, his disloyalty to the

United States, his loyalty

to the Soviet Union, and the fact

that he was a Marxist:

When asked to explain why he wanted to delay Oswald's

denunciation "in view of the Petrulli case and other considera-

tions" (W.R. 748; C.E. 908), Snyder stated that Nicholas Petrulli

had earlier defected, that Petrulli's defection was nullified

by a determination that he was mentally incompetent, that

Snyder wanted to avoid a repetition of this incident, and

that "other considerations" meant common sense and prudence.

After this

meeting with Oswald, Snyder did not talk

with Mcvickar

and he did not contact any intelligence ufficers;

instead, he drafted a cable to be sent to Washington. Since

this

cable contained all of the information Snyder obtained

from Oswald, and since it would be sent through the appropriate

persons

at the embassy, he saw no need to contact anyone. He

may have talked to Freers before he sent the cable, but he did

not talk to anyone else. No one in the embassy approached him

to discuss this cable.

Several days later Oswald sent Snyder a letter protesting

his treatment at the embassy. Snyder cabled this information

to Washington.

McVickar may have tipped journalist Priscilla Johnson

McMillan concerning Oswald's visit to the embassy. MoVickar

never told Snyder about

any information on Oswald which MCVickar

may have obtained from McMillan. Snyder knows of no other jour-

nalists who were tipped about Oswald's defection.

Regarding contacts with American journalists in Moscow,

Snyder stated that he knew Priscilla Johnson McMillan personally,

knew of A. I. Goldberg, had an official contact with Aline Mosby

concerning a Soviet provocation, and had two or three official

contacts with R. J. (Bud) Korengold concerning consular issues

which could not be followed up at the embassy. In recent years

Snyder has had contact with McMillan concerning her book

Marina and Lee

as it pertains to Snyder.

Snyder remembers that some time after Oswald's visit

to the embassy Oswald

sent two letters to the embassy from

Minsk.

Snyder had two meetings with Oswald upon his return from

Minsk in 1961. Snyder has no independent recollection of thè

first of these meetings, but he said that records show that

such

a meeting occurred on a Saturday. The meeting must have

been brief. Oswald probably said that he wanted to return to

the United States, and Snyder probably told Oswald to come back

to the embassy later. McVickar and Snyder's secretary Verna

Deane Brown probably had contact with Oswald during this visit

and during Oswald's subsequent visit.

When Oswald returned to the embassy he seemed "meek."

He probably admitted that he had "learned a hard lesson the hard

way," and.

he expressed

a concern that he might be prosecuted.

Snyder asked him about his various activities in the soviet

Union. Oswald stated that he had not given any information to

the Soviets.

Snyder did not expedite Oswald's

actual return to the

United States, which transpired after Snyder had left the Soviet

Union. Snyder did not expedite Oswald's application to renew

his passport; instead, he gave it "no great priority" as a

"petty way of getting even" with Oswald, whom he did not like.

McVickar handled Marina Oswald's visa application. Snyder

does not recall ever meeting Marina Oswald, and he was not aware

that her uncle was

a Soviet MVD officer.

Snyder did not know why two applications for passport

renewal (C.E. 938; C.E. 947) were made out for Oswald. When

asked why one application (C.E. 938) had been marked, "I have

'been naturalized as a citizen of a foreign state," etc., Snyder

thought this was a typographical error.
