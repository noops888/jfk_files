“‘*MS"informant “adviseathat~tnes

During the Fall of 1953, the Algam Corporation
‘came under investigation by the state appointed moreland
Act Commission, which was investigating harness racing
tracks. After numerous hearings, the Old Country Trotting
Association, Incorporated was ordered to sell its Yonkers
stock under a common ruling which beanédinterlocking direct-
orates in-the harness racing industry.

Other New York hood Lut: anterestsyini race tracks was
reported on September 10, 1958,°:by “PCT SEYMOUR POLLACK.
On that.date POLLACK advised that SA VATORE | \GRANELLO
and his partner and associate ahongs Peeve are the present
owners of the Oriente Park Race Trac. Hayana, Cuba...
uals also’ operate
gambling casinos at the track site and obtain most of
their revenue from this. latter activity.

: Regarding the Oriente Park Race Track, an interview
with well known hoodlum MEYER LANSKY by Bureau agents in
1939 indicated, according to LANSKY, that he and FRANK

» ERICKSON, nationally known New York gambler, had in 1938

obtained a six year contract to operate the track. LANSKY

-at that time failed to indicate the exact degree of

ownership that he and ERICKSON exercised in the operation
of the track.

Cc. Degree of Influence

No additional information is known concerning
the amount of influence exerted by the above individuals
in the operations of the tracks involved, other than
that set out above.

It is also noted that although NICHOLAS RATTENNI
holdsa large block of wee ee stock in Roosevelt Raceway,
there was as of August, 1958, over six and one half million
shares of stock outstanding in that corporation.

It would appear, however, that in sizing up the
degree of influence exerted by these individuals on the
entire industry in the New York Division that it could be
considered negligible.
