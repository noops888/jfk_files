NY 100-42479
NY T-4 is NY 4o47-s*.
NY T-5 is NY 4110-s*.

The letterhead memorandum is classified
"Confidential" since it contains information from
CG 5824-S*, a highly placed informant.

The NYO is of the opinion that the subject's
sudden plan to depart the US may be significant,
especially in following her activities after her return
to the US. It is believed that in all likelihood she

y again travel to China since NY 4047-S* advised
Kat she cont d the Czechoslovak Mission to the
IMnited Nation; It is to be noted that prior to her
last trip to China, she went to Prague, Czechostovaicia.(U)

WFO is requested to contact and maintain
liaison with the US Department of State to discreetly
determine subject's date and mode of departure from the
US.

e Bureau is requested to contact, through
liaison d the Legat, London, and have them attempt
to disc determine subject's contacts and activities
in England and elsewhere. The Bureau will be advised

of any further details developed as to the subject's
departure and itinerary.
