NICO RANDUM FOR THE BECORD

IRPORT OF INTERROGATION

DATE: 29 July 1965

•Folloing higblights:

•) AXKITA (DPIQ): Subject displayed a superficial

knowledge of this basic questionnaire.

He knows generally

the appearance, the nature of the questions, and the parpose

of the document.

Incorrectly, that

1t was required in two copies, that he filled it out at bone,

that it conslated of 4-6 pages.

He anended his story to say

that he does not romember for sure whether : he turned 1t ln

to BOZENKO 'a people on one of his first visits, or gave 1t

to

BAXHANOV when he first reported for work.

COMKKNT: An ordinary member of the KGB might conceivably

have forgotten the details of this document which vas

filled out only at the beginning of his career.

COMMENT:

Again, although Subject might bare forgotten

1$ 11 he had been juat a plain case officer in the KGB,

he should know of 1t as & supervisor, or even as

Secretary of the Konsonol Organization (1t La a CC/CPSU

queationnaire).

d) SPRAYKA No. l: Thia document is reguired for

every personel action.

Subject did not react at all to

1ta mme and said be didn't knon of 1t.

When it's purpose

was described to him, Subjoct managed to give a superficial

descriptios of the document.

Colind: An ordinary case officer would know of the

existence of this form, but would not necessarily have

over soen 1t.

As deputy chief of a department, however,

Subject would handle this document 30-40 times a year.

and would be thoroughly faniliar with it.

Thus, bie

limited knowleage of it could only havo come Iron a brief.

Posluzhney Spook (Enployment and Service Record):

Asked about tbia document,

Subject gave a good description of

1ts nature and purpose.

His answor that he himself did not

fill it out but that it was filled out by personnel on the

basis of the data in his Anketa 1a perfectly plausible. It

1e odd, however, that Subject insiated that he did not sign

this document when be first entered the KGB (as 1a nomally

done), but only "in 1958 or 1957.

In the ankal: particularly the question on bile former aire,

Subject was asked how he anered some of the questions

her relatives, and on bis mother's ancestry.

I then asked

Subject hor it was, taking into account his mother's aristocratie

ancestry, the fact

that be father died in Jall, the Trotskyito

allegations aginat Subject's lather, the lact that Subject's

forner Satbor-in-law was stild In jail, and the fact that Subject

was present ben TELEGIN's apartment as searched - that be

had been accepted into the KCB, particularly in 1953: Subject

adnitted that the question was

dogical, and sald that he could

only assume that the Ilfluence of KOBULOV and the important

and influentiad position of his own father outweighed there

nogative factors.

He alao cited bis GRU expertence in thin

connection.

I then anted Subfoet pou be tad mported big recond

mariage to the KGB:

He replied that before the marriage be

EXES OHLY

Wo an a nate check do targetire pride outch

another anketa for personnel in which be included all the

required data on his wife and her relatives.

After considerable

prompting, Subject said that he had indicated that she and her

parents had been in France, but that be had concealed the lact

that her grandmother had been in German occupied territoty

during the war (ho admitted that the KGB would have learned

this in a routine check, however.)

I then retiewed for Subject

the negativo security factors mentioned above, adding the

arrest of KobuLov,

the fact that his new wife and her parents

had been abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in German-

occupied territory, the fact that subject was now everage for....

the Konsomol but not yet & party neuber or candidate, and the

Inct that Subject recoived « 15 day sentence for misuse of

cover documents and incurring venerenl disease, and asked

1f be didn't think that

'bis personnel file had been reviewed

in 1934, and 18 so. what grounds there could have been for

retaining him in the KGB.

Subject said that he thought that

his file probably was reviewed but that ugain the influence

of bis father had saved bim.

Subject added that another

important factor was probably his languago qualification and

particularly his bigher education.

I told Subject that we

would examine the question of his education in greater detail

Iator.

He made no comment. I also pointed out to Subject

that 11 bla secoad wife and her parents bad been abroad 1t

was Inpossible that ber name check could have been negative.

He sinitted it was Illogeal, but Insisted that this was so.

CONCLUSIONS: Evidence contines to pile up to show

that Subject was never in a supervisory position in the KGB,

and that be could not have and did not enter the KGB in 1953.

Ile weak knowledge of the documents discussed indicates that

11 be was ever in the IGB at all it as liter, and for a

relatively short time.

5. Despite the fact that I continued to challenge Subject

frequently.

the tone of the interrogation was perticularly

friendly today. The following excharge was of some interest:

Fubject: You probably worked for tronty yeare in personnel!

Ted: Not exactly. You should know better.

Subject:

No, I don't know. If you fold me your name?

Ted:

We'll talk about that later, and maybe even drin

to each other's boalth.
