HEMORANDUM FOR THE ESCORD
REPORT OF INTERROGATION
DATE: 29 July 1965

1. Questioning was concentrated on documents that had
to be filled out when Subject was entering the KGB. Komsomol
questions and service in the Baltic were not touched at all.
Following highlights:

a) ARKETA (DPHQ): Subject displayed a superficial
knowledge of this basic questionnaire. He knows generally
the appearance, the nature of the questions, and the purpose
of the document. He continued to maintain, incorrectly, that
it was required in two copies, that he filled it out at hone,
that it consisted of 4-6 pages. He amended his story to say
that he does not rewember for sure whether whe turned it in
to BOZHENKO's people on one of his first visits, or gave it
to SAXHAROV when he first reported for work.

COMMENT: An ordinary member of the KGB sight conceivably
have forgotten the details of this document which waa
filled out only at the beginning of his career. As a
supervisor, however, Subject claims to have reviewed
@any personnel files (as be should have): a such, he
could not possibly muske the mistakes tbat he has about

. irr document, or be unable to give a better description

b) Secrecy Agreewent: Subject himself stated that
bbe had signed such a form for SAKHAROY when he first reported
for work. He was unable to remeuber the proper designation
or contents of the document. however. The description of
the wording which he provided was similar to that used prior
to 1947; also, it is similar to the secrecy agreement that ~~
might be signed by an agent.

ec) Licbniy Listok pe Uchetu Kadroy: This is not a
wery importan' locument, it it is ed out by every
officer, and ig found in every personnel gile. Subject was

got only unable to recall it, he maintained he had never
beard of it even afterit was.described to hia.

COMMERT: Again, although Subject might have forgotten
it 1f he bad been just a plain case officer in the KGB,
he should know of it as a supervisor, or even as
Secretary of the Komsomol Organization (it is a CC/CPBU
questionnaire).

a) SPRAVKA No.1: This document is required for . i
every personnel action. Subject did not react at all to
ite name and said he didn't know of it. When it's purpose i
wi deacribed to his, Subject managed to give a superficial
deacription of the document.

COMMENT: An ordinary case officer would know of the
existence of this form, but would not necessarily have
ever seen it. As deputy chief of a department, however,
Subject would bandle this document 30-40 times a year.
and would be thoroughly familiar with it. Thus, bis !
limited knowleage of it could only have come from a brief. i

e) Posluzhney Spsok (Employment and Service Record):
Asked about this document, Subjecg gave a good description of
its nature and purpose. His answer that he himself did not
fill it out but that it was filled out by personnel on the
basis of the data in his Anketa is perfectly plausible. It
is odd, however, that Subject insisted that he did not sign
this document when he first entered the KGB (as is normally
done). but only “in 1958 or 1957."

2. Subject was asked how be answered some of the questions
ia the Anketa, particularly the questions on his former wife,
her relatives, and on bis mother's ancestry. I then asked ie
Subject how it was, taking into account his mother's aristocratic
anceatry, the fact that he fatber died in jail, the Trotskyite
allegations against Subject's father, the fact that Subject's
former father-in-law was still in jail, and the fact that Subject
was present when TELEGIN's apartment was searched -- that he
had been accepted into the KGB, particularly in 19535 Subject ~
admitted that the question was logical, and said that he could
only assume that the f@fluence of KOBULOY and the imporéaot
and influential position of his own father outweighed these
negative factors. He also cited his GRU experience in this
connection. .

n_agked Suhiect how he bs¢ cenorted nie second _
warriage to the KGB. He replied that hefore the marriage he
bad mentioned it briefly to GORBATENKO, and that he had

unofficially run a miae check on hie prospective bride. (which
was “clean"), and that after the marriage he bad filled out
another anketa for personnel in which he incluged all the
required data on bis wife and her relatives. After considerable
prompting, Subject said that he had indicated that she and her
parents had Seen in France, but that be had concealed the fact
that her grandmother had been in German occupied territoty
during the war (he admitted that the KGB would have learned
this in a routine check, however.) I then reviewed for Subject
the negative security factors mentioned above, adding the
arrest of KOBULOV, the fact that his new wife and her parents
had been abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in German-
occupied territory, the fact that Subject was now everage for ..
the Komsomol but not yet a party member or candidate, and the
fact that Subject received a 15 day sentence for misuse of
cover documents dnd incurring venereal disease, and asked

if be didn't think that ‘bis personnel file had been reviewed
in 1954, and 16 so. what grounds there could have been for
retaining him in the KGB. Subject said that he thought that
his file probably was reviewed but that again the influence

of bis father had saved bim. Subject added that another
important factor probably his language qualification and
particularly his higher education. [I told Subject that ve
would examine the question of his education in greater detail
later. He made no comment. I also pointed out to Subject
that if his second wife and her parents had been abroad it

was impossible that ber name check could have been negative.
He admitted it was illogi¢al, but insisted that this was so.

4. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence continues to pile up to show
that Subject was never in a supervisory position in the KGB,
and that be could not have and did not enter the EGB in 1953.
His weak knowledge of the documents discussed indicates that
if _be was ever in the KGB at a1] it was léter, and for a
relatively short time.

5. Despite the fact that I continued to challenge Subject
frequsntly, the tone of the interrogation was perticularly
friendly today, The following exchange was of some interest:

Subject: You probably worked for twonty years in personnel!

“ed: Not exactly. You should know better.

‘Bubject: No, | X don't know. “Tf you told me your name?

Ted: We'll talk about that later, and maybe even drink
to each other's health.
