d. A Letter from Jose de Jesus JINJAUMA to Carlos
ZARRAGA. The letter in question was received by ZARRAGA
Trom JINJAUMA, stated that certain dissident and pri-

marily DR types were ready to take action against Castro
provided their personal safety and future means’ of sub-

istence were guaranteed. _It named AMWHIP/1's friend

Ob rey ar spear wummawtma He,ttecghapgel for, trans-
Gttal of these guarantees. ZARRAGA, “ recalled, is a
former JURE member who had recently resigned, The people

involved in the letter, in addition to JINJAUMA, were
identified as follows:

Captain (fnu) GIRON, :

Luis FERNANDEZ de la Camara (member of Fidel's personal
: body guard)

Guiliermo (Billikéng)

Garcia RIESTRA

AMLASH/1

Tony CASTELLE

Faure CHOMON

In discussing the letter with AMWHIP/1, he stated that
it was quite likely that this letter was legitimate and,
while JINJAUMA might have asked for such guarantees, it
was unlikely that AMLASH/1 would have himself required
such guarantees, (C/O Comment: We report this as told
to us by AMWHIP/1 but do feel that duc to the closeness

of AMWHIP/1 and AMLASH/1, AMWHIP/1 may be allowing
AMLASH/1 the benefit of the doubt in this case.)

AMWHIP/1 stated that he knew all of the people in

the letter except Captain (fnu) GIRON. He stated

that it had been quite likely for JINJAUMA to write

to Gallerretta as they had been, as were all the |

others mentioned in the letter, hew=teen members of 7
the old UIR group which functioned as a counter-
terrorist element against Batista's first regime circa

: ‘1944, AMWHIP/1 stated that, in fact, Fidel Castro

himself had been a'member of the UIR. ANNHIP further
stated that there was no doubt in his mind that Fidel,
knowing these men as he did, was well aware of their
antagonism tevards his regime, Other members of the
UER. which AMWHIP/1 could recall were as follows:

Marin DAPICO Antonio oe
Herminio Biaz (friend of APMEGEIRAS) -

Laureano ALVAREZ (presently in N.Y.C., Tel. LUdlow

r 9-0209)
Armando CORREA (presently in Miami)
Jesus DIEGUEZ (presently in Miami)
two PARSONS brothers (presently in Miami -
Other data unknown)

ZARRAGA of course was also a member of the UIR. AMWHIP/1
Stated that the most influential members of this group
were or had been JINJAUMA, Fernandez de la CAMARA,
Billiking, and possibly Marin DAPICO, AMWHIP/1 stated
that these people were action types and were reasonably
close-knit so far as their loyalty to each other and
in turn the organization was concerned.

e, AMWHIP/1 was also asked to elicit from AMLASH/2
any information which the latter might have concerning
Cuban officials with their hands “in the till" or other-
wise knocking down on the Government, and/or putting money

away in foreign banks,

3. Finances,
AMWHIP/L was given a token gift of a box of 50 cigars

in appreciation for the amount of time he freely devotes to
KUBARK business. He reluctantly accepted the sum of $500 against
his ops expenses in the past and for the coming trip to Europe,

It was thought, by the way, that a $1000 or more would have been

a much more sealistic figure to have given him, However, as he

has always déae in the past, he is reluctant to accept money for

his services or for his expenses incurred on KUBARK's behalf.

He did admit, however, that he would probably again be touched

for a “loan” by AMLASH/2 and,as he laughingly Stated,these "loans"

wt habitually +z .«- forever, We also estinated that the

various transoceanic phone calls he has made in pis behalf, the G
abterts BLANCO}

‘AFU/19 and others will easily exceed the $500 he has been

mced. A signed receipt was obtained,

4. . Security
There were no incidents of a security nature to report

as stated above. There were very few people in the offices due
to the fact that today was Yom Kipper.
