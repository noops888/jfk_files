SYLVIA DURAN'S PREVIOUS STATEMENTS RE LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S

VISIT TO THE CUBAN CONSULATE IN MEXICO CITY

On November 23, 1963, one day after the assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy, the Central Intelligence
Agency's Mexico City Station suggested to Mexican officials
that they arrest Sylvia Tirado de Duran. (Mexi 7029 to
the Director, Nov. 23, 1963; Note to Luis Echevarria,
November 23, 1963) The Mexico City Station asked that
Sylvia Tirado de Duran be held incommunicado until she told

the Mexican officials everything she knew about Lee Harvey

Oswald. The Mexican government arrested Sylvia Tirado de

Duran the same day. Captain Fernando Gutierrez Barrios,
Assistant Director of the Federal Security Police, interro-

gated her at 6:00 p.m. that evening. (CE 2121, p. 35)

A. Version of Interrogation Given Lo the Warren Commission

By The Mexican Government

Ms. Duran stated that she became secretary to the
Consul, Eusebio Azcue, three months prior to the assassina-
tion of President John F. Kennedy, due to the death of
Maricarmen Olivari. (Ibid. p. 37) She stated that in late
September or early October of 1963 a North American by the
name of Lee Harvey Oswald appeared at the Cuban Consulate
and applied for an intransit visa to Russia by way of
Cuba. (Ibid. p. 39) Duran stated that Oswald presented

presented evidence that he had been in Russia for three
years, that he was married to a Russian woman and also

that he was the leader of an organization in New Orleans
called "Fair Play for Cuba." Sylvia Duran stated that
Oswald stressed that his visa application should be accepted
as he was a friend of the Cuban, Revolution. (Ibid. p. 39)
Sylvia Duran stated that there, in compliance with her
duties, she had Oswald fill out the appropriate application
(Ibid. p. 39). Oswald then left and returned in the after-
noon with the necessary photographs. (tia. p- 39) Ms.
Duran stated that at that time, exceeding her duties,

she telephoned the Russian Consulate because of her interest
in facilitating the handling of the Russian visa for

Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid. p. 39) The Russian Embassy told
Duran that there would be a delay of approximately four
months in processing the case, which annoyed Lee Harvey
Oswald since, according to his statements, he was in a
great hurry to obtain a visa to travel to Russia. He
jiinsisted on his right to obtain a visa in view of his back-
ground and activities on behalf of the Cuban movement. (Ibid.
p- 39) When Oswald understood that. it was not possible

to give him a Cuban visa without previously obtaining a

Russian visa, he became extremely angry. (Ibid. p. 39)



Sylvia Duran Statements
Page 3.

At this point Ms. Duran stated she called Consul Azcue,
who, at that time was in his private office accompanied

by his upcoming replacement Alfredo Mirabal. (Ibid. p. 40)
Mr. Azcue came out of his office. and argued with Oswald

in English. (Ibid. p. 40) Ms. Duran stated that Mr.

Azcue told Oswald that a person like him instead of aiding
the Cuban Revolution, did it harm. (Ibid., p. 40) Oswald
at that point stated that he had two reasons for request-
ing his visa with such urgency: one, that his Mexican per-
mit expired soon; and two, that he needed to reach Russian
soon. (Ibid., p. 40) Sylvia Duran stated that in spite

of the argument she gave Oswald a pice of paper with her
name and Consulate business phone number (11-28-47) (Ibid.,
p- 40) Ms. Duran stated that she also initiated the handl-
ing of his visa application by sending it to the Cuban
Ministry of Foreign Relations, from which a reply was re-
cevied in the normal manner some fifteen to thirty days
later approving the issuance of an intransit visa on

the condition that he previously obtain a Russian visa.
(Ibid. p. 40) Mrs. Duran stated that she does not recall
whether Oswald subsequently called her on the Consulate
phone number which she had given hin. (Ibid. p. 40) Sylvia
Duran stated that all the conversations that Eusebio Azcue

and she had with Oswald were in the English language since



Sylvia Duran Statements
Page 4.
Oswald did not speak any Spanish. (Ibid. p. 40) Finally,
she stated that upon seeing Lee Harvey Oswald's photograph
in the newspapers, she immediately recognized and identi-
fied it as being the same person that she remember as Lee
Harvey Oswald. (Ibid. p. 40)

At the time of Sylvia Duran's detainment her perti-
nent statements about Lee Harvey Oswald were written by
the Mexican government and given to Mrs. Duran to read

and sign.

B. Original Signed Statement of Sylvia Duran Interrogation

By the Mexican Government

Upon learning about the assassination she and her
husband speculated that President Kennedy might have been
assassinated for racial reasons. When she became aware
that the assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald, she ascertained
that it was the same man that approximately two months °
prior had been to the Cuban Consulate to solicit an intran-
sit visa to Russia. Having taken his name from the special
documentation he presented she knew that he was married to
a Russian woman and belonged to the “Fair Play for Cuba
Committee." She checked the data in:the Consulate archives
and became certain that it was the same individual who was
blonde, short, dressed unelegantly and whose face turned red

when agry. ‘The Consul had denied the visa because to

obtain an intransit visa from the Cuban government, it

was imperative that he previously obtain a visa from the
Soviet Consulate. Since obtaining a visa from the Soviets
took four months and Oswald's Mexican visa expired soon
Oswald became excited and Duran had to call the Consul
who had an argument with him. The only aid she could give
Oswald was advising that he see the Soviet Consul, and
calling the person in charge of that office. The Soviet
official told her that they would have to consult Moscow

which would take four months. That afternoon, Oswald re-

turned to the Cuban Consulate and Sylvia Duran confirmed
that he could get a Cuban visa only after he received a
Russian visa. She gave Oswald her name and business phone
number but never gave him her address because she had no
reason to give it to him. She knew that phoning the Soviet
Consulate was not one of her duties and that if she did
so she did it only to help Oswald’ She gave Oswald her
business phone number only because he would have to call
subsequently to check whether he had obtained a visa. He
never called back. (Blind Memo re Lee Harvey Oswald and
Sylvia Duran, November 26, 1963, CIA #473).

Sylvia Duran was released November 24, 1963 and
rearrested November 27, 1963, when the Mexican government

alleged that she was attempting to leave Mexico and travel

November 27, 1963, Mexi 7104, CIA #482; Cable from Mexico
City Station to Headquarters, November 27, 1963, Mexi 7101,
CIA #493). The Mexican officials told Sylvia Duran that
they were detaining her to protect her. (HSCA Staff Inter-
view of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78 p..— JFK Document No.
Subsequently about her second detainment, Duran stated, ~
"They were very rough this time...they repeated the same
questions but they were more, how do you say, evil. And
they...wanted to know exactly what I have done in Cuba,
the people that I met there, everything. They were asking
me questions about all the people that were working the
Embassy and this time I wanted to go to the bathroom and
they wouldn't let me and it was longer, because it was
from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. (HSCA Staff Interview of

_ Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78 p. JFK Document No. )
According to the Mexican officials that detained Duran

a second time she remembered Oswald perfectly and denied
he wore glasses. Otherwise there was no addition to her
story. (Cable from Mexico City Station to Director,

December 12, 1963, Mexi 7364, CIA No. 557-558).

an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final destina-

p. 533) There was a procedure whereby the American Com-
munist Party would arrange visa matters for their members
with the Cuban Communist Party. (Ibid. p.532-533) The
American would then come to Mexico, visit the Cuban Consulate
and receive his visa immediately. (Ibid., p.533) When
Duran asked Oswald why he did not have the American Com-
munist Party arrange his trip to Cuba he stated that he
did not have time. (Ibid., p.532)

Duran explained to Oswald that he had to acquire
a Russian visa before he could receive a Cuban visa.
(Ibid., p.534) Duran jotted her name and business phone
number on a piece of paper and gave it to Oswald who
ee left to get his Russian visa. (Ibid., p.549, 534)

Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate between
5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., which was after normal working
hours, 10:00 to 2:00 p.m. (Ibid., p. 543) The guard

Since ‘he did not produce it when asked she called the

that Oswald had been to the Consulate requesting a visa
and had been told that the reply would take approximately
four months. (Ibid., p.545) When she relayed the message
to Oswald he got very excited, insisting that as a per-
son who had been infait because of the Cuban Revolution
he should receive a visa. (Ibid., p. 546) Oswald stated
that he could not wait a long period of time because his
Mexican visa expired in three days. (Ibid., p. 546) At
this point Ms. Duran called the Consul, Eusibio Azcue,
who was in his office accompanied by his upcoming replace-
ment, Alfredo Mirabal. (Ibid., p. 546) Azcue politely
explained the requisites for an intransit visa to Oswald.
(Ibid., p.. 546, 554) When he noticed that Oswald was a
stubborn man he told Oswald that he was obviously not a
friend of the Cuban Revolution, because if he was a friend
he would understand that Cuba had to be extremely careful
with the people it allowed in Cuba. (Ibid., p. 554) Azcue
and Oswald yelled at each other. (Ibid., p. 551) Then
Azcue went to the door, opened it and asked Oswald to
leave. (Ibid., p. 554) Oswald did not revisit or tele-

HSCA INVESTIGATION OF SYLVIA DURAN'S ACCOUNT OF LEE HARVEY

OSWALD'S VISIT TO THE CUBAN CONSULATE IN MEXICO CITY

To investigate Sylvia Duran's account of Lee Har-
vey Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate the Committee
sought the cooperation of the Cuban Government. The Com-
mittee traveled to Cuba twice interviewing most of the
Cuban employees at the Cuban Consulate and Embasssy in
Mexico City in September 1963. (See Procedural Writeups
Cuba Trips 1 and 2) Only two individuals remembered Oswald,
Eugbio Azcue Lopez and Alfredo Mirabal Diaz. Only Eustbio
Azcue personally dealt with Lee Harvey Oswald. Afredo
Mirabal could only state that he never doubted that the
Lee Harvey Oswald who visited the Consulate was the same
Lee Harvey Oswald shot by Jack Ruby in the basement of the
Dallas Police Department.that he caught’ only glimpses of
him. (HSCA Interview of Alfredo Mirabal Diaz, p-
also
For this reason,only Eusebio Azcue Lopez and Sylvia Tirado

Bazan's accounts will be dealt with in detail.


Sylvia Duran Statements

After interviewing Sylvia Duran and Eusebio Azcue
the Committee has found conflicting stories. Ms. Duran
told the Committee that Lee Harvey Oswald visited the
Cuban Consulate on three occasions, all on September 27,
1963. (HSCA Interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Docu-
ment No. , p. 523) This contradicts her statement
to the Mexican officials that Oswald had visited the Con-
sulate on two occasions, both on September 27, 1963. (See
section entitled Version of Interrogative Given to the
Warren Commission by Mexican Government. ( (Also, see sec-
tion entitled Original Signed Statement of Sylvia Duran
Interrogation by the Mexican Government.) Though neither
report quotes Tirado as stating that Oswald's visits were
on September 27, 1963, she states that they occurred on
the same day in late September or early October. (Ibid.)
When the House Select Committee on Assassinations checked
Oswald's visa application, the date September 27, 1963
was clearly markedbn it. (See Oswald Visa application.)

Mr. Azcue remembered three visits to the Cuban Con-
sulate occurring on different dates. Mr. Azcue stated
that Oswald's first visit would have been "one or two days
prior to the date on the visa application at around 1:00

p.m."  (HSCA Interview of. Eusebio Azcue, , JFK

probably returned to the Consulate the following day

“at approximately the same time that he came on his first
visit" (Ibid., p. 4) with his photographs--"probably
that same day listed on the (visa) application, the 27th
of September." ‘(Ibid., p- 3) Azcue stated that Oswald
left to get a Soviet visa and probably returned to the
Cuban Consulate one day after he had filled out the visa.
(Ibid., p. 6(Tape 2)) Mr. Azcue stated that it was then
that he had the argument with Oswald. (Ibid., p. 6 Tape 2)

Ms. Tirado stated that Oswald first visited the
Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m. requesting
an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final destina-

When Azcue noticed that Oswald was a stubborn man he told
Oswald that obviously he was not a friend of the Cuban
Revolution, because if he was a friend he would understand
that Cuba had to be extremely careful with the people it
allowed in Cuba. (Ibid., p. 47) Ms. Tirado stated that
Azcue and Oswald yelled at each other. (Ibid. 44) Azcue
then went to the door, opened it and asked Oswald to

Ms. Tirado stated that Oswald did not revisit or
telephone the Consulate because if he had she would have
remembered it. She stated that the Consulate did not have
many American visitors who had been to Russia and had
married a Russian woman attempt to get a Cuban visa and
then get into an argument with staff personnel. (Ibid. p

Lee Harvey Oswald's number of visits to the Cuban
Consulate on September 27, 1963 are not of major substan-
tive importance. The importance lies in Lee Harvey Oswald's
visit to the Cuban Consulate after visiting hours. (10-2)
Ms. Duran told House Select Committe on Assassinations
staffers that Lee Harvey Oswald made his third visit to the
Consulate late afternoon around 5:00 p.m. (HSCA Interview

surveilled both the Cuban and Soviet Diplomatic compounds
electronically. From the electric surveillance of the
Soviet Embassy the Central Intelligence Agency learned
of the following two conversations:

whel dsl >)

> Sylvia’ Dufan called

At approximately 4:05 p.
the Soviet Embassy. She told the person at the Embassy
that an American citizen seeking a visa was at the Cuban
Consulate. Sylvia explained that the American citizen
wanted to know the name of the official he had dealt with
at the Soviet Embassy. Sylvia had sent the American to
the Soviet Embassy stating that his acquiring a Cuban
visa was contingent on his previously acquiring a Soviet
visa. Sylvia explained to the Soviet official that the
American had stated that he was assured that there would
be no problem. At that point, the Soviet official put
another official on the phone causing Sylvia to repeat
the story. The official then asked Sylvia to leave her
name and number to call her later. This conversation was
also in Spanish. (Classified Staff Summary of Review
of CIA Documents, 3/9/78, pp. 6-7; Cable from Mexico to
the Director, 11/23/63, MEXI 7025; CIA Transcript from
Russian Embassy, 9/27/63.)

At 4:26 p.m. an unidentified Soviet official
called Sylvia Duran inquiring whether the American citizen

had been to the Cuban consulate office. Sylvia responded


Sylvia Duran Statements

Page 20.

affirmatively, stating that the American was at the office
at that time. The Soviet official told Sylvia that when
the American visited the Soviet Consulate office he had
displayed papers from the Soviet Consulate in Washington.
He also had a letter stating that he was a member of an
organization that favored Cuba..-.The American wanted to

go to the U.S.S.R. with his Russian wife and remain there
a long time. The Soviet official had not received an
answer from Washington to ‘the American's problem. The prob-
lem traditionally took four to five months to resolve be-
cause Washington had to secure authorization from the
U.S.S.R. The Soviet official added that the American's
wife could get a visa in Washington very quickly and she
could have it sent anywhere but that he felt that the Ameri-
can would not get a visa soon. Sylvia said that the Cuban
government could not give the American a visa because he
had neither friends in Cuba nor authorization (?) for a
visa from the U.S.S.R. The Soviet official added that

the Soviets could not give the American a letter of recom-
mendation because they did not know him. This conversa-
tion was also in the Spanish transcripts. (Classified
Staff Summary of Review of CIA Documents, 3/9/78, pp. 7-10;
Cable from Mexico City to the Director, 11/23/63, MEXI

7025; CIA Transcript from Russian Embassy, 9/27/78.)


Sylvia Duran Statements
Page 21.

These two phone calls were summarized by Sylvia
Duran when she stated that she called the Russian Consu-~
late who said that Oswald had been told that the reply
from the Soviet Union would take approximately four months.
(See Version of interrogation given to the Warren Comnis-
sion by Mexican Government; Original signed statement of
Sylvia Duran Interrogation by the MeXpoan government; and
HSCA interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Document No.
Ms. Duran failed to mention that the Soviet official took
her number and called her back. The Committee attributes
Ms. Duran's neglect to mention the call from the unidenti-
fied Soviet--probably the Soviet Consul--to forgetfulness,
since she has consistently stated the substance of the
conversation. (Ibid.)

Mr. Azcue stated that he understood that the
Soviet Consul called him but "maybe a secretary called
the Soviet Consul and then the Soviet Consul called me,
that's possible. (HSCA interview of Eusebio Azcue, JFK
Document No. , Tape 2, p. 11) Mr. Azcue's statement
does not explain the Friday, September 27, 1963, 4:26 p.m.
call because it was Sylvia who spoke to the Soviet Consul.
(See September 27, 1963, 4:26 p.m. call.) Azcue states
that hé spoke to the Soviet Consul. The Committee has ne-
ver seen a transcript of this phone call. One of four ex-

planations is possible: 1) The Soviet Consul called Azcue

on the line. At first, the American spoke in Russian
and the Soviet spoke English. The conversation then pro-
ceded in English until the Russian discontinued it, and
put another Soviet on the line. The Soviet spoke in
English but the American, in broken Russian, asked him
to speak Russian. The conversation resumed in Russian
at that point. It also became incoherent and is thus

Sylvia Duran Statements

The Committee feels that there is a possibility
that the American Sylvia Duran put in contact with a So-
viet official on Saturday, September 28, 1963, was Lee
Harvey Oswald. The American citizen had previously visited
the Soviet Consulate and called from Sylvia Duran's of-
fice on a Saturday when the guard never allowed visitors
into the Cuban compound:. (tia. p. 549)

The Committee feels that Sylvia may have lied
about an Oswald visit to the Cuban Consulate on Saturday,
September 28, 1963, for either of two reasons: 1) Ms.

Duran did not wish to disclose that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Consulate again after his argument with Consul
Eusebio Azcue and that she had decided to aid him; 2) Ms.
Duran may have had personal reasons. Elena Garro de Paz
reported that she attended a "twist party at Ruben Duran's
house which Oswald, accompanied by two other American young
men, also attended." (See write-up.) Elena also reported
that Duran had an affair with Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid.)
The Committee attempted to locate Elena Garro de Paz who
might have shed some light into this area. (See Elena
write-up.) If Sylvia Duran did in fact have an affair
with Lee Harvey Oswald, he might have visited the Consulate
on Saturday and Sylvia would have denied it.

The Committee also feels that there is a possibility
that the man Sylvia put on the phone with the Soviet offi-

cial on September 28, 1963 was not Oswald. The man Duran

put on the line spoke broken Russian. George De Mohren-
schildt, Marina Oswald and George Bouke all stated that
Oswald spoke a very refined Russian and that he preferred \

speaking Russian to English. (Note: String Cites:

Nonetheless, Ms. Duran ‘Tied to thé committee about
the guard not allowing visitors into the Cuban compound
on Saturdays as the electronic surveillance files for
September 28, 1963 illustrate.

When Eusebio Azcue and Sylvia Tirado were asked ee
to describe Lee Harvey Oswald, both gave similar discrip-
tions of him that are not even remotely close to Oswald's
physical appearance. Consul Azcue stated that the man
who visited the Consulate looking for a visa differed
from HSCA JFK Exhibit No. as follows: his nose was
more aquiline; his eyelashes were straighter; his hair
was blonde; his height was between five feet six and five
feet seven; he was between 35 and 37 years of age; his
cheeks were sunken; and, he had a cold look in his eyes.
(House Select Committee on Assassinations Interview of
Eusebio Azcue, , JFK Document No. + Ppp. 19-21)
Consul Eusebio Azcue further stated that the man who
came to the Cuban Consulate requesting an intransit visa

and the person that Jack Ruby assassinated at the Dallas

police station--which he saw on television--were different
persons. (Ibid. p. 18)

Ms. Tirado stated that the person that visited
the Cuban Consulate and the person she saw Jack Ruby as-
sassinate at the Dallas police station were the same per-
son. (HSCA Interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Document
No. 1 Pe ) Yet, when Ms. Tirado describes the
(alleged) Lee Harvey Oswald that visited the Cuban Consulate,
the man does not really bear any resemblance to Lee Harvey
Oswald. Ms. Tirado stated that Lee Harvey Oswald was
approximately five feet six, had blonde hair, weighed
about 125 pounds, had small eyes, smaller fingers than
Ed Lopez (HSCA staffer) and did not have very much hair.
(Ibid. p. 96)

Since neither description resembles Oswald the
Committee has determined that there is a possibility that
the man who visited the Cuban Consulate was not Lee Harvey
Oswald. It is difficult to justify the above since the
House Select Committee Handwriting Panel has determined
that the signature on the visa application matches other
samples of Lee Harvey Oswald's signature. There is a pos—
sibility that a man who claimed that he was Lee Harvey Oswald

picked up an application, took it to Lee Harvey Oswald who

,
filled it,/ attached pictures, signed it and then returned

to the Cuban Consulate once again impersonating him. The


Sylvia Duran Statements

Committee considers this a possibility because when the
Committee staffers asked Duran if she would ever have
allowed a person to take the application out of the Con-~
sulate, fill it out, attach a photo, sign them and then
return them to the Embassy she answered affirmatively.

(Ibid. p. 31) (Also no photos materialized.) The one
problem with this possibility is that Ms. Tirado stated

that she thinks Lee Harvey Oswald signed the visa application

in her presence. (Ibid. p. 33)

CIA Handling of Sylvia Duran Matter
President
When/John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November

22, 1963, the United States investigative agencies -- FBI,
CIA, Secret Service, etc.~-were asked to investigate the
assassination. When the Central Intelligence Agency learned
that Lee Harvey Oswald had visited Mexico City between
late September and early October they reviewed their

files and found in the electronic surveillance files

phone calls to the Soviet Embassy made September 27th,
September 28th, and October lst. that could have been
made by Oswald. (See Electronic Surveillance Section.)
They also found phone calls between the Russian Consul

and Sylvia Duran where Oswald appeared to be discussed.
(See Soviet Electronic Surveillance Section.) In addition
they found a phone call made by Sylvia Duran to the

Soviet Consulate on September 28, 1978, where Sylvia Duran
stated that there was an American “eitizeri at the Cuban
Consulate who had previously visited the Soviet Consulate,
and put a man on the line. (See Soviet Electronic Surveil-
lance Section.) A final phone call where Oswald identified
himself was also found. (See Soviet Electronic Surveillance

Section.)

At this point the Central Intelligence Agency
determined that it would ask the Mexican Government--
whom it had a good relationship with--to arrest Sylvia
Duran because she might shed some light on the circum-
stances surrounding the assassination. Sylvia Duran was
also a Mexican citizen and did not have diplomatic immunity.
The Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico City Station
sent a note to Luis Echevarria requesting that he arrest
Sylvia Sylvia Tirado de Duran immediately. The agency
stated that she was a Mexican citizen who had put Oswald
in touch with the Soviet Embassy. The agency gave Echevarria
a note with Duran's address, her mother's address, her
brother's address, her license plate number, her home
phone number and her place of work. The Mexico City
Station also suggested that Duran be held incommunicado
until she could be questioned on the matter. (Note to Luis
Echevarria to arrest Sylvia Duran, November 23, 1963, CIA
No. 444; Cable re oswald-Duran, Mexi 7029, November 23,
1963, CIA No. 441; Anne Goodpasture Chronology, Wx 7241,
entry 36, November 23, 1963, CIA No. 635)

The requést to Luis Echevarria was not authorized
by the Central Intelligence Agency's Headquarters. When

they received the cable on November 23, 1963, Headquarters


JGo- [0042-0 FO/

feared that the coyvert surveillance operations might be
endangered. Jack Whitten stationed at Langley Headquarters,
telephoned Winston Scott, the Mexico Chief of Station \
asking that Sylvia Duran not be arrested. Scott told Whit-

ten that it was too late, that he could not recall the

request and that Headquarters shoulda already have received

a cable which stated that Luis Echevarria had already

been told to arrest Sylvia Duran, as a Mexican initiative.

Jack Whitten, November 23, 1963; Chronology prepared by Anne

Goodpasture, WX 7241, entry 37. November 23, 1963, CIA

No. 635) Winston Scott then telephoned Luis Echevarria
and stated that the agency hoped that Sylvia Duran's ar-
rest would be kept absolutely secret, that all information
received from Duran ine cabled to Washington immediately
through the Mexico City Station and that her arrest and
statements not spread to any leftist groups. (Chief of
Station phone call to Luis Echevarria, November 23, 1963,

discovery

The Central Intelligence Agency feared/that Amer-
icans were behind the arrest of Sylvia Duran. It would
endanger their continuing cofvert surveillance operations.
For this reason the Mexico City Station requested the
Mexicans to arrest Sylvia Duran on their initiative.
Similar logic dictated when Headquarters asked the Mexico
City Station to request the Mexican authorities to inter-
rogate Sylvia Duran to the extent necessary to clarify
the outstanding points raised in their @ables the previous
forty-eight hours. Headquarters stated that the Mexico
City Station could provide questions to the Mexican
interrogators but that they wished no Americans to come
in contact with Duran. (Cable CIA Headquarters to Mexico
City Station, November 27, 1963, DIR 85318, CIA No. 497;
chronology of Anne Goodpasture, November 27, 1963, entry
no. 121, CIA No. 653) When on November 27, 1963, the
Mexico City Station sent a photostatic copy of Sylvia Du-
ran's ten page signed statement to Headquarters (Cable
Mexico City Station to Headquarters, November 27, 1963,
Mexi 7105, CIA No. 479; Chronology of Anne Goodpasture,
November 27, 1963, entry no. 127, CIA No. 656) the follow-
ing day Headquarters sent a clarification cable to the
Mexico City Station. Headquarters wanted to insure that

neither Sylvia Duran nor the Cubans got the impression


Sylvia Duran Statements
Page 33.
that the Americans were behind her rearrest. The cable
stated "We want the Mexican authorities to take the res
sponsibility for the whole affair." (Cable from Headquarters
to the Mexico City Station, November 28, 1963, DIR 85371,
CIA No. 464; Chronology of Anne Goodpasture, November 28,
1963, WxX7241, entry no. 141, CIA No. 658)

When the Central Intelligence began to deal with
the Warren Commission, Headquarters cabled the Mexico
City Station that their present plan in passing informa-
tion to the Warren Commission was to eliminate mention of
telephone taps in order to protect their continuing opera-
tions. Headquarters stated that they would rely on Sylvia
Duran's statements and on the Consular files which the
Soviets gave the State Department. Headquarters stressed
that exact, detailed information from io o/ ana
i ol a (Penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy) on just
what Sylvia Duran and other officials said about Oswald's
visits and his dealings would be valuable and usable
corroborative evidence. (CIA cable from Headquarters to
Mexico City Station, December 21, 1963, DIR 90466, CIA
No. 549; Chtonology of Anne Goodpasture, December 21, 1963,

April 1964 the Agency still felt that if an American con-
tacted Sylvia Duran their covert continuing operations
might be endangered. Headquarters cabled the Mexico City
Station that one of the touchy subjects that the staffers
would discuss was whether they should talk to Sylvia Duran
in Mexico at the Consulate. (Cable Headquarters to Mexico
City Station, April 8, 1964, DIR 13026, CIA No. 698
Headquarters further cabled that the Warren ‘Commission staf-
fers knew that the Central Intelligence Agency had tap
assets and that they might have guessed from the coverage
that they had photo points and a source in the Cuban Em-
bassy but that they did not know the details on the Agency's
arrangements with & oy i. Headquarters stressed

that the Chief of Station should lend them all the needed
assistance with the minimum possible disclosure of assets
and techniques. (TIbid.)

At this point the House Select Committee on Assassi-
nations has determined that the Central Intelligence Agency
thought their continuing electronic surveillance operation
extremely sensitive and important. The Warren Commission
would have needed to disclose sensitive information to
contradict Sylvia Duran's story. The Central Intelligence
Agency had input into what could go in the Warren Report.
