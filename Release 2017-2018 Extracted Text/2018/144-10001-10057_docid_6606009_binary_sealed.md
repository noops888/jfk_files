MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Report on Beanination of Matertal

Related to Lae Harvey Oswald Case

The undersigned have examined all the naterial relating

to the lee Harvey Oswald case provided to us by the Warren

commission and have found no Indication that any of the

Items was used for a cryptographic purpose or for passing

secret infornation:

A detalled examination of the dictionaries fatled

to show any indication that they had been used in connection

with a dictionary code.

A review of the letters of all the correspondenta

related to the case, as well as of the Oswald Diary and

other documents, provided no suggestion of the use of an

open code.

C. :

perforations which suggested the use of a grille

system appeared on two pages of the russtan novel, GLAZA

KOTORYE: SPRASHIVAYUS,

"Questioning Eyes". However, the

manner of perforating only a few letters does not conform

to any known system. For purposes of further study, we

would like to obtain the original of the novel on long-teru

or permanent loan. Me believe, nevertheless, that it ia most

ralated to Oswald's photograpbic experiments.

a.:

The appearance of the tern "micro dots" on page 44

of lee Oswald's address book aroused our suspicions,..

particularly in that it was associated with the address of

the photographic firm where he was once employed.:

There

was nothing to indicate to us that micro dots were actually

used and we have had to assuna that appropriate technical

tests were made by the fBI or CIA.

Oswald's Soviet made portable radio receiver and

its associated power supply were examined and tested by

R34 with negative results.

The radio (for purposes of the

teste the power supply was considered an Integral part)

conformed closely to one examined by the British In 1959,

A copy of R34'a findings 1s attached:

f. The names appearing in lee's and Marina's address

books have been checked against NSA files but no COMOT

references have been discovered. Collateral references

held in the tiles have only confirmed known information.

A Copy of the report 1a attached.

g•:

In adaition to the Information on the addresses

developed in the personality check, a separate stay of

NSA address files is being made.

anile this study 1s

not yet complete, results have so far been negative and

there is no reason to expect that anything beyond what

the personality check has already tured up will be

discovered.

MEMORANDUM FOR DR. TORDELLA

SUBJECT: Letter for the President's Commission

1. Please note that I have eliminated two items from the original

Memorandum for the Record on the examination of the Oswald materials.

These are the reference to "micro dots" (paragraph d) and the COMINT

reference in paragraph 1.

2. 1 suggest that you informally (possibly by telephone) call the

Commission's attention to the appearance of the term "micro dots" on

page 44 of Oswald's address book. You might Indicate that this reference

aroused our suspicion but that we do not feel competent to make an

exhaustive examination of the materials for the presence of micro dots -

such examination should be conducted by the FBI or CIA. If micro dots

are actually found, we would be happy to collaborate to the fullest

degree required in the analysis of these dots.

3. I do not belteve a statement that we have checked the names

against the NSA files needs to be made since:

The results were negative and

b. It identifies the existence of sensitive COMINT records.

Of course, If we had found something, a positive roport would have been

required.

4.2

Mr. Arnold has reviewed the text of the letter and accepts it

as unclassified under the circumstances.

ATIN: Mr. J. Lae Rankin

General Counsel

Dear MI. Rankin:

Skilled cryptologists at NSA carefully examined the materiale

ralating to the Los Harvey Oswald case provided by the Warren Com-

mission. The results are as follows:

a. A detalled examination of the two dictionaries revealed

no indication of their use for cryptographic purposes:

b. In the corespondence, the Oswald Diary.. and the other

documett s examined there were no evidences of the use of any type

of cryptography, to include the use of an open code.

c.

Certain letters had been removed from pages 150 and 152

of the Russian novel, GLAZA KOTORYE SPRASHIVAYUT, "Questloning

Eyes." Eight letters had apparently been cut from page 152 as follows:

Ine 10

Line 11

Line 13

lane 16

Line 24

Line 26

Line 27

*, 0

One letter had been removed from page 150; however no significance

15 attributed to the removal of this letter since it corresponds in exact

position to one of the letters removed from page 152. It was con-

cluded that this letter had been accidently removed by the cutting

process applied to page 152 and that its removal resulted from the

application of excessive pressure on the cutting tool when the letter

on page 152 was taken out.

The sample is considered too small for any valid conclusions to

be reached as to the purposes for which the above noted letters were

removed. It is considered most unlikely that this process of letter

removal has any cryptographic implication.

d. The Russtan "Tourist" portabla radio was examined for

cryptologie evidence. The radio appears to be a normal receiver and

there was no evidence of its use for any other purpose.

The names appearing in Lea's and Marina's address

books were checked. No evidence of cryptologie Implication was

found.

Although the results of the examination of the materials provided

by the Commission are essentially negative, further study of these

materials will be made. Il any results are obtained, the Commission

will be advised. However, it ts considered most unlikely that any

thing beyond what is reported above will be discovered.

Sincerely

GORDON A. BLAKE

Lieutenant General, USAF

Director
