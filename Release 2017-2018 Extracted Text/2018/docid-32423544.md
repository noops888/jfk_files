Conspiracy to Violate Title 47, U.S.C. §605
(Wiretapping)

The following consists of a summary of the Bureau's
investigation and the results of their investigation into

the wiretapping of Dan Rowan's phone in his hotel room at

the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada, in October 1960.

The Bureau's initial investigative report dated November 10,
1960, reflects the results of an interview with Lt. carl smith
of the Detective Bureau, Clark County Sheriff's Office on
November 1, 1960, involving the arrest of Arthur Balletti on
October 31, 1960 for bugging the telephone box in Dan Rowan's
hotel room. A search of Balletti's hotel room reflected
notes and notations which Balletti had written down dates

and times on which he had recorded portions of Rowan's
telephone conversations. A black suitcase in Balletti's

room was opened and it contained a large quantity of
electronic devices, including transmitters, receivers, wall
plugs, a minifon wire recorder and a set of 17 professional-
type lock picks. On his arrival at the Clark County Sheriff's
Office, Balletti admitted that he had been hired by Investiga-
tions Incorporated of Miami, Florida, a company owned by
former FBI Agent Edward DuBois, and that this company
apparently had a client who had requested an investigation
concerning Rowan's private life. Balletti admitted listening
to and recording Rowan's telephone conversations since
October 26, 1960. According to Balletti, one Fred T. Harris,
an investigator from Miami, had entered Rowan's room and
installed the listening device.

Results of Bureau Investigation Conducted
at Criminal Division Request

By a report dated December 23, 1960, at Miami, captioned,
“arthur James Balletti; J. W. Harrison Unauthorized Publication
and Use of Communications," a Special Agent of the Bureau
advised that Edward L. DuBois, Jr., was interviewed on
December 13, 1960, in Miami, Florida, at which time he stated
that he had handled certain matters for a Robert Maheu, who
operates a private investigation organization in Washington,
D.C. DuBois stated that on October 25, 1960, he received a
telephone call from Maheu's principal assistant, one Walter
Fitzpatrick, requesting him to send two men to Las Vegas,
Nevada right away for physical surveillance work. Maheu
subsequently instructed DuBois to send only one man to
Las Vegas and advised DuBois that he had hired one
J. W. Harrison to accompany whomever DuBois sent. DuBois
advised that he sent Balletti to Las Vegas on October 26,
1960. DuBois next heard from Balletti when Balletti phoned
stating that he had been arrested in Las Vegas as a result of
a wiretap and DuBois added that Balletti had been hired
strictly for a physical surveillance.

The above-mentioned report dated December 23, 1960,
reflects that on December 13, 1960, Arthur James Balletti was
interviewed in Miami, concerning his activities in Las Vegas,
Nevada. Balletti stated that he would discuss his activities
with great reluctance and that it was very probable that he
would refuse to answer many questions. Balletti advised that
on October 26, 1960 he had flown from Miami, Florida to Las
Vegas -on a physical surveillance assignment on the orders of

‘i \ TMs employer, Edward L. DuBois, and that it was his under-

_j \Jstanding that he was actually working for some other private

TOP SECRET

Inthe course of questioning by Lt. Smith, Dan Rowan
advised that within an hour of discussing the wiretapping of
his phone with Phyllis McGuire of the McGuire Sisters Trio,
he received a call from the "bosses" whom he would not identify
who told him that under no circumstances was he to press
charges against Balletti or try to determine why his conver-
sations were being recorded and that if he did they would
see that he was ruined professionally. Lt. Smith asked Rowan
if Sam Giancana, the Chicago hoodlum, who was known to have
kept company with Phyllis McGuire in the recent past might
have wanted to know what conversations Rowan and McGuire were
having. Rowan replied, "How did you know about that?" and
stated, "You certainly could have the answer." On November 1,
1960, Rowan appeared at the Clark County Sheriff's Office and
signed a release, stating that he desired that all charges
against Balletti be dropped and that no action be taken by
the Clark County Sheriff's Office with regard to the
purglary and the intrusion of privacy by use of a listening
device, stating that Balletti was only working for someone
else.

Request for Investigation .

By memorandum dated December 5, 1960, the Criminal Division
requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation to conduct a full
investigation, noting that the facts set forth in the report
referred to above indicated a violation of the provisions of
47 U.S.C. §605, and a conspiracy by Arthur James Balletti,

Fred 1. Harris, and possibly Investigations, Inc., Edward

DuBois and others.

| investigator who had requested the assistance of DuBois. According

| to Balletti, at the Miami International Airport he met an in-
dividual he identified as J, W. Harrison from a description
previously given him and they flew together to Las Vegas.
Balletti advised that while in Las Vegas he physically sur-
veilled Dan Rowan and that Harrison apparently put some sort
of wiretap in Rowan's room there and monitored Rowan's phone
conversations and that he, Balletti, had nothing to do with the
tap, did not see it installed and never did any monitoring.
Balletti denied that he was accompanied to Las Vegas by one
Fred T, Harris, stating that Harrison had used a ticket in the
name of Harris and, for this reason, the police in Las Vegas
apparently assumed Harrison was Harris. According to Balletti,
Harrison left Las Vegas before Balletti was arrested on
October 31, 1960, Balletti said he could not comment upon
the electronic equipment found in his room.

An FBI investigative report dated December 22, 1960,

at Los Angeles, reflects that on December 21, 1960, Dan Rowan
furnished a signed statement to special agents of the Bureau

at Los Angeles, California. According to Rowan, after originally

signing a complaint against Balletti, he discussed the phone
tapping incident with Harvey Silbert and Elias Atoll, members of
the corporation which operates the Riviera Hotel and he, Rowan,
decided that pressing charges against Balletti would inconvenience
him. On November 1, 1960 at the Sheriff's Office, Rowan signed a
xelease and dropped charges against Balletti. Rowan advised that he

did not give
/anyone authority to record telephone calls or to install
listening devices in his Room No. 228 or No. 226 at the
Riviera Hotel.

A Bureau investigative report dated December 30, 1960
at salt Lake City reflects that on December 20, 1960, Lt.
carl Smith advised that Balletti had been charged with in-
vasion of privacy, a felony; possession of burglary tools,

a misdemeanor; and operating as a private detective without
a license, a misdemeanor, with a preliminary hearing set
for April 24, 1961 in Justice of the Peace Court, Las Vegas.

The manager of Trans World Airlines, Las vegas, advised
that company records reflect that one, F. T. Harris departed
Las Vegas on-Trans World Airlines Flight No. 292 at 10:30 a.m.,
on October 30, 1960, to St. Louis, Missouri, where he made
connections with Trans World Airlines Flight No. 76 to Miami,
Florida.

On December 22, 1960, the desk clerk at the Riviera Hotel
was contacted and shown nine photographs, including one of
Fred T. Harris. The desk clerk advised that he could not
identify anyone whose photo had been exhibited as being identical
with the individual who checked into the Hotel on October 26,
1960 under the name of J. W. Harrison. The desk clerk added
that he did not think he would recognize either Balletti or
Harrison if he should see them in person.

On December 21, 1960, at Las Vegas, Nevada, Lt. William
Witte, Clarke County Sheriff's Office, furnished a list of

articles in Balletti's possession at the time of his arrest.

These included a telephone bug transmitter recovered from
behind the bed in Room 228 at the Riviera Hotel; 17 lock
picks; 2 telephone bug devices; one ear phone; one cigarette
case containing a miniature transmitter; one Minox camera;
one Minox film and other electronic and physical devices,
equipment and tools, all enumerated on three typed pages of
the foregoing investigative report dated December 30, 1960.

The hotel manager of the Riviera Hotel advised that
hotel records reflect that from October 27 to November 5,
1960, Rowan made 15 long distance calls to Edgewood, Nevada,
and that most of the calls had apparently been made to
Phyllis McGuire,

The hotel manager also advised on December 21, 1960 at
Las Vegas, Nevada, that according to hotel records, Arthur J.
Balletti checked into the hotel on October 26, 1960 and was
assigned Room 331 and that the registration card bears the —
notation, "in room with Harrison". Since Balletti's hotel
bill was in excess of $100 and he was not known, the manager
and the chief of security for the hotel went to Room 331 and

no one was in the room when they entered. At this time, they

observed a yellow pad with the notation of time and a date
which referred to Dan Rowan and the hotel manager observed in
the top desk drawer what appeared to be a recording device.
After discussing the bill with Balletti and receiving a some-
what uncertain identification, the hotel manager subsequently
notified the Clark County Sheriff's Office that he had ob-
served what appeared to be a recording device in Balletti's

room and suspected that a listening device might be installed

and another Deputy, name unrecalled, entered Rowan's room
and the hotel manager observed what appeared to be some type
of microphone taped to the rear headboard on the bed in Rowan's
room with wires running to the telephone wall box. The hotel
manager observed the Deputy Sheriff remove the article from
the headboard.

This matter was discussed with Assistant United states
Attorney Raymond Sutton on December 22, 1960, and he advised
Special Agents of the Bureau that he desired to have the re-
sults of a full investigation prior to rendering a prosecutive
opinion. Mr. Sutton stated that upon the receipt:of results
of full investigation he would, in all probability, present
the matter to the next federal grand jury which meets in Las
Vegas. ,
By letter dated January 19, ne Assistant Attorney
General of the Criminal Division advised the United states
Attorney at Reno, Nevada, Mr. Howard W. Babcock, attention:

Mr. Raymond Sutton, that the United states Attorney furnish
the Criminal Division with his prosecutive opinion upon com-
pletion of the investigation and that he not institute criminal
prosecution without our prior authorization, unless time is of
the essence.

According to a Bureau report dated December 12, 1961, at
Washington, D. C., Robert Maheu of Maheu and King Associates,
Inc., Washington, D. C., advised on December 27, 1960 that
he had received a call from a Los Angeles attorney asking Maheu

to recommend someone to do investigative work in Las Vegas,

Nevada fora client. Maheu stated that he recommended Edward
DuBois and that the Los Angeles attorney requested him to
contact DuBois to make the necessary arrangements to handle
the investigation in Las Vegas, Maheu stated that he could
not recall if he or Walter Fitzpatrick, an associate of Maheu
had contacted DuBois regarding this request. He stated that
his firm was not involved in this matter and that DuBois had
been contacted only as a favor to the Los Angeles attorney.
Maheu denied that he had made a second call to DuBois in-
structing him to send only one man to Las Vegas, adding that
he does not know any J. W. Harrison and is not acquainted with
Arthur James Balletti. Maheu advised that he did not desire
to furnish the identity of the Los Angeles attorney who
originally contacted him without the attorney's consent

By letter dated January 27, 1961, Mr. Howard Babcock ad-
vised the Criminal Division that prior to any presentment that
office would be furnished with a prosecutive opinion and
noted that the Bureau investigation in this matter has not
yet been completed.

An FBI investigative report dated February 8, 1961, at
Salt Lake City, reflects that efforts to identify unknown
subject, J. W. Harrison, have been unsuccessful.

The above report dated February 8, 1961 also reflects that
on January 2, 1961, at New York City, Phyllis McGuire advised that
she had not given authority to anyone to install a listening
device on Dan Rowan at any time and had no prior knowledge that such
a device had been used before the arrest of Arthur James Balletti.

The above report also reflects that Thomas Foley, Attorney-
at-Law, advised on February 6, 1961, at Las Vegas, Nevada, that
during the latter part of October 1960, he received a tele~
phone call from James P. Cantillion, a Los Angeles attorney,
requesting Foley to represent Arthur J. Balletti who had been
arrested by the Clark county Sheriff's Office. Foley asked
cantillion about payment of the legal fee and Cantillion stated
that he would personally guarantee its payment. Foley stated
that he immediately contacted a bail bondsman and arranged
bond for Balletti. Foley stated that he was of the opinion
that James P. Cantillion is the son of father and son team,
Cantillion and cantillion, a law firm in Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia. Foley advised that Balletti's trial on the local
charge was set for April, 1961.

A Bureau investigative report dated January 28, 1961
at Miami, Florida, reflects that Fred T. Harris advised on
January 24, 1961 that although he formerly worked as a pri-
vate investigator for Investigations, Inc., from June 1960
until November 16, 1960, he did not work for Edward L. DuBois.
However, since November 16, 1960, he has been back with DuBois
almost full time. Harris stated he definitely did not accompany
Balletti to Las Vegas and knew nothing of this affair and while
he could not pinpoint his complete activities, he was certain that
he was never out of Miami during the period from october 26
through 30, 1960. Harris also stated that he knew nothing
of electronic devices and never had any sound training and

sort of
would have no idea as how to install any/wiretap.

The same report reflects that Edward DuBois was inter-
viewed on January 24, 1961, at Miami, Florida, stating again
that Maheu had informed him that he could only send one man
to Las Vegas, that he gave two round-trip tickets to Balletti
who went to the Airport, met Maheu's man and travelled to
Las Vegas. DuBois stated that Fred Harris definitely did not
accompany Balletti to Las Vegas and did not work for him
from June until the middle of November, 1960. DuBois stated
he had no idea who had hired Maheu and that he had received
$1,000 from Maheu for Balletti's services in Las vegas.

When he, DuBois, learned of Balletti's arrest, he contacted
Maheu in Los Angeles and Maheu knew of Balletti's arrest and
arranged for a Los Angeles attorney to defend him. Maheu
indicated he had made these arrangements through a Los Angeles
attorney whose identity he did not disclose.

According to the above-mentioned report, dated January
28, 1961, at Miami, Florida, the desk clerk of the Kenilworth
Hotel advised, on January 25, 1961, that registration records
reflect that Robert A. Maheu of Washington, D. C., was
registered in Room 722 from October 11-29, 1960 and that
he was accompanied by one J. A. Rollins, also of Washington,
D. C., who stayed in Room 701 from October 11-30, 1960. It
was the desk clerk's recollection that Maheu paid the bill
for both of the rooms and she noted that it was possible that
either Rollins or Maheu could have left the hotel for a few
days and return and if the room was not given up, such informa-

tion would aps reflected on the registration card.

A Bureau investigative report dated February 14, 1961,
at Miami, Florida, reflects numerous long distance phone calls
of Robert Maheu made in October 1960 from the Kenilworth Hotel
and four such calls made by J.A. Rollins during October 1960.

A Bureau investigative report dated March 6, 1961, at
Los Angeles, California, reflects the telephone listing for
the Los Angeles number called by DuBois immediately after
Balletti's arrest and the telephone listing for Los Angeles
numbers called by Maheu and J.A. Rollins from Miami Beach
in October 1960. In addition, the report reflects that James
P. Cantillion, attorney, Los Angeles, California, advised on
March 1, 1961, that his first knowledge of the microphone
incident in Las vegas, Nevada, came from a telephone call
to him from a man in custody at Las Vegas whose name he could
not recall. When given the name Balletti, Cantillion acknowledged
that the name was probably correct but stated that he had no
knowledge of Balletti prior to the call which came from a Lieutenant
either from the Clarke county's Sheriff's Office or the Las
Vegas City Jail. He claimed privilege for his conversation
with Balletti but advised that he referred the caller.to
attorney Tom Foley in Las Vegas. Cantillion stated that he
knew Robert Maheu. Cantillion denied telephoning or otherwise
contacting Maheu in Washington, D. C., or elsewhere, to ask
him to perform surveillance on Dan Rowan.

A Bureau memorandum dated March 13, 1961, at Los Angeles,
california, reflects information concerning James P. Cantillion

James Cantillion of Beverly Hills, California. Records of
the Los Angeles, California Police Department reflect that
John Roselli, FBI # 3339986, was first arrested by the Los
Angeles Police Department in 1924 for carrying concealed
weapons, but the charge was dismissed. During the period
from 1924 to 1932, he was arrested on several occasions on
charges of suspicion of grand larceny, carrying concealed
weapons and robbery. In testimony before the Kefauver
Committee in October 1950, Roselli advised that he met Al
Capone in Chicago and that he spent a day with Capone in
Los Angeles, California, in about 1930. Records of the
United States District Court indicate that on December 22,
1943, Roselli was found guilty of violation of Section 402A,
Title 18, U.s.c., and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.
The charge involved extorting money from motion picture pro-
ducers to insure the studios against labor strikes.

The above report reflects that Cantillion was apparently
involved in business transactions with Roselli and had been
visited by Roselli and one Louis J. Lederer, a close friend
of Roselli and apparently linked to nationally-known hoodlum
and gambler, Frank Costello, of New York. cCantillion, Lederer
and Roselli were, according to the report, all involved in
hotels and gambling operations in Las vegas, Nevada.

A Bureau investigative report dated March 27, 1961, at
Washington, D. C. reflects that on January 19 and January 30,
1961, Robert Maheu was interviewed and remained unable to
supply the name!of the Los Angeles attorney who had originally

coritiactédShim and requested him to contact Edward DuBois.

Maheu advised that he had stayed at the Kenilworth Hotel in

i Miami Beach during the latter part of October 1960, but

| denied that he had instructed DuBois to send only one man
to Las Vegas and stated that his only involvement in the
matter was to have DuBois contacted at the request of the Los
Angeles attorney. Maheu identified the J.A. Rollins who was
with him at the Kenilworth Hotel as John A. Rollins and would
not identify him further, stating Rollins was working indirectly
for him in Miami, Maheu denied that Rollins was the individual
who went to Las Vegas to assist Balletti. shortly after the
interview, Mr. Maheu telephonically contacted a special
Agent of the Bureau at the Washington Field Office, stating
that “he had just received a telephone call and if this matter
could be held up for a few days, it would be all straightened
out."

A Bureau report dated April 6, 1961, at Miami, Florida,
reflects that Balletti was interviewed on March 29, 1961 at
which time he denied ownership of the technical equipment
confiscated in his hotel room aside from a tape recorder and
cameras. Balletti stated that he did not recall telling the
arresting officers at Las Vegas that J. W. Harrison was,
actually Fred Harris of Miami. Balletti stated that on
October 30 or 31, 1960, he received a long distance telephone
call from Robert Maheu who instructed him to contact T. W.
Richardson at the New Frontier Hotel. Maheu advised Balletti

TOP SECRET

Docld: 32423544 Page 19

-14-
that Richardson would pay him $1,000 and that when Balletti
contacted Richardson giving a password, Richardson gave him
10 one hundred dollar bills in a men's room. Balletti again
denied that he knew the true identity of J. W. Harrison.

The same report reflects that on March 20, 1961, DuBois
advised that Robert Maheu had paid him $1,000 in cash as his
retainer.. DuBois claimed that Balletti had told him that on
October 31, 1960, he, Balletti, received a long distance
telephone call from Maheu who claimed that he was calling
from Los Angeles and instructed Balletti to contact a mr.
Richardson and that Richardson would pay him the retainer.
DuBois was asked if he knew John A. Rollins and he stated
that he did not know anyone by that name. DuBois was
questioned regarding the equipment found in Room 331 of
the Riviera Hotel at the time Balletti was arrested and
DuBois denied that any of the technical equipment aside from
the minifon tape recorder and the cameras belonged to his
agency. DuBois assumed that the equipment belonged to J. W.
Harrison. DuBois reiterated that he did not know the name
of the principal in this case who contacted Maheu to have ps
the surveillance conducted on Rowan.

A Bureau report dated April 11, 1961 reflects that a
communication from the Washington Field Office dated February 13,
1961, advised that Maheu was still unable to secure permission
from the attorney to divulge the attorney's name to the FBI.
Maheu denied that Rollins was the individual who went to Las

vegas with Balletti, stating that the Kenilworth Hotel records

in Miami would reflect that Rollins was there during the period
Balletti was in Las vegas.

This report reflects that by communication dated March 28,
1961, the Riviera Hotel registration card, which contained the
handwriting of the unknown subject, also known as J. W. Harrison,
was submitted to the FBI Laboratory to be compared with the
handwriting on the registration card from the Kenilworth Hotel
at Miami Beach which bears the name J. A. Rollins.

According to a Bureau investigative report dated April 12,
1961 at Los Angeles, California, Dan Rowan telephonically con-
tacted a special agent of the Bureau on April 5, 1961 at which
time he advised that he did not believe that he had any information
of pertinence to add. Rowan stated that he first heard of
Sam Giancana from a Lt. Smith with the Clark County Sheriff's
Office, Las Vegas, Nevada and stated that he had never met
Giancana. Rowan advised that he has discussed Giancana on
one or two occasions with Phyllis McGuire, observing that she
was hesitant to discuss Giancana and stated that her relation-
ship with him took place long ago and she saw no reason to
discuss it. McGuire stated that Giancana still sends her gifts
and flowers, but that this is entirely his idea and she has
nothing to do with him.
CIA Involvement

A Bureau memorandum dated April 20, 1961 at Washington,

he was now in a position to furnish additional information re-
garding the situation involving the subjects at Las Vegas,
Nevada. At this time, Maheu offered his explanation (set
forth in detail in a previous memorandum concerning Central
Intelligence Agency involvement in this matter) that Rowan's
hotel room was to be the subject of electronic surveillance
in connection with determining the source of a leak of in-
formation on the part of an individual in the Chicago area.
Maheu stated that his work could be verified by “Shef Edwards",
Colonel Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security, CIA.

The Director of the Bureau advised the Attorney General
by memorandum dated May 22, 1961 that the full investigation
requested in this matter is continuing, although the memo
noted in view of the information regarding CIA's attempted
utilization of the "hoodlum element" in connection with anti-
Castro activities, CIA has requested that this information
be handled on a "need-to-know" basis. The Bureau also
attached to this memorandum the results of an interview on
May 3, 1961 with Colonel Sheffield Edwards, Director of
Security, Central Intelligence Agency, which has previously
been set forth in detail in the memorandum setting forth the
CIA's involvement in this matter.

By communication dated April 11, 1961, the FBI Laboratory
advised that the handwriting on the Kenilworth Hotel, Miami
Beach, registration card and the hand-printed name of J.A.

Rollins was not comparable with the handwriting on the Riviera

On May 13, 1961, records of the Clark County Sheriff's
Office reflect that the State charges against Arthur James
Balletti were dismissed on April 24, 1961, since the complaining
witness did not desire to prosecute.

A Bureau investigative report dated June 6, 1961 at
Washington, D. C. reflects that on May 25, 1961, Maheu again
advised of his involvement with the Central Intelligence
Agency inannection with their attempt to utilize Giancana
in connection with the CIA's activities against the castro
government. Maheu stated that the original contact with
Giancana was made by "Johnny" who Maheu declined to further
identify. Maheu stated that it was his decision to have
a microphone coverage installed in Rowan's room and he was
extremely careful as he did not want to involve the CIA.
Maheu advised that DuBois did not know the CIA's interest in
this matter and in requesting DuBois to handle the assign-
ment, he had used a pretext indicating to DuBois that a Los
Angeles, California attorney had made the original request
for coverage of Rowan, Maheu still denied that he had called

one
DuBois instructing him to send only/man to Los Angeles and
that he, Maheu, would supply the second man. Maheu sub-
sequently advised that he had sent word to Sam Giancana as
to the extent of the investigation following his Bureau

interview on May 25, 1961.

An FBI report dated June 26, 1961 at Miami, Florida
reflects that Edward DuBois and Arthur Balletti, after
viewing a photo of John Roselli, said on June 20, 1961 that
they did not recognize him and that they have not been in
contact with him in connection with their investigation of Rowan at
Las Vegas, Nevada. However, one employee of the Kenilworth
Hotel advised that she believed the photograph of John Roselli
was a photograph of J.A. Rollins, but could not make a
positive identification without seeing the man in person.

An FBI report dated June 29, 1961, at Las Vegas, Nevada,
reflects that on June 17, 1961, the manager of the Riviera
Hotel advised that he knows John Roselli by sight and that
so far as he knew, Roselli had never stayed at that hotel
and he felt sure that Roselli was not the individual who
checked into the hotel on October 26, 1960, using the name
J.W. Harrison.

According to a Bureau investigative report dated June 30,
1961, at Los Angeles, Robert Maheu advised on June 29, 1961
that the "Johnny" to whom he made contact with sam Giancana
was John Roselli and that he discussed the plan to wire Rowan's
room with Roselli before it was done. It was pointed out to
Maheu that the explanation he gave in a previous interview
for wiring Rowan's room did not appear logical and was far
removed from the purpose for which he was hired by the Central
Intelligence Agency. Maheu stated that he would stick to the
explanation previously given and wished to add that he would
never have ordered Rowan's room wired except for his connection
with the CIA.

An FBI investigative report dated July 19, 1961, at
Chicago, reflects that Samuel M. Giancana was interviewed
at O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, on July 12, 1961
by special agents of the Bureau and he refused to make any
comment regarding Maheu and refused to admit that he was
acquainted with Dan Rowan, In the course of the interview,
Giancana became very abusive and obscene. During this time,
Miss Phyllis McGuire, who apparently traveled with Giancana,
was also interviewed by special agents of the Bureau, although
the results of that interview were not reflected. The
special agents' conversation with Giancana was terminated upon
the appearance of Miss McGuire. Giancana left accompanied by
Miss McGuire.

An FBI report dated July 20, 1961 at Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia, reflects that Maheu was interviewed on July 15, 1961
and persisted in his story with respect to the bugging of
Rowan's hotel room, Maheu denied that the installation of
the device in Rowan's room was made at the request or for
the benefit of Sam Giancana or John Roselli.

The same report reflects that Roselli was interviewed
on July 7, 1961, and admitted that he had known Maheu for
approximately 5 years. When asked if he knew Giancana, Roselli
stated, "Let's discuss the weather. I do not care to answer
any more questions."

On August 2, 1961, United States Attorney Howard W.
Babcock, at Las Vegas, Nevada, advised that he is not certain
that it could be proven that any information received by

Balletti and the; unknown subject was ever "disseminated" and also

he was very concerned about the possibility of information
becoming known of Robert Maheu performing work for the CIA.

By letter dated October 13, 1961, Mr. Babcock noted
that his successor assumes office on October 16, 1961 and,
therefore, felt it appropriate that his successor review the
file and investigative reports.

In response to a request from the Criminal Division
dated January 31, 1962, the Bureau ascertained from the
Director of Security of the Central Intelligence Agency, Col.
Sheffield Edwards, that his Agency would object to any
prosecution which would necessitate the use of CIA personnel
or CIA information and that the introduction of any evidence
concerning the CIA operation would be most embarrassing to
the United States Government. This Bureau reply was dated
February 9, 1962.

In response to an additional request from the Criminal
Division dated March 19, 1962, the Bureau replied, by memo~
xandum dated April 10, 1962, that Col. Edwards advised that
Maheu's prosecution undoubtedly would lead to exposure of
most sensitive information relating to the abortive cuban
invasion in April 1961 and in view of this, his Agency ob-
jects to the prosecution of Maheu.

By memorandum dated April 24, 1962, Mr. Herbert J.
Miller, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,
advised the Attorney General that it is clear that the
national interest will preclude any prosecution resulting from

the Nevada wiretap case, adding at the conclusion of the memo

that. prosectt

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: Arthur James Balletti et al - Unauthorized Publication
or Use of Communications

1. This memorandum for the record is prepared at the
request of the Attorney General of the United States following a
complete oral briefing of him relative to a sensitive CIA operation
/ _ conducted during the period approximately August 1960 to May
1961. In August 1960 the undersigned was approached by Mr.
Richard Bissell then Deputy Director for Plans of CIA to explore
the possibility of mounting this sensitive operation against Fidel
Castro. It was thought that certain gambling interests which had
formerly been active in Cuba might be willing and able to assist
: and further, might have both intelligence assets in Cuba and
\ communications between Miami, Florida and Cuba. Accordingly,
i Mr. Robert Maheu, a private investigator of the firm of Maheu
and King was approached by the undersigned and asked to establish
contact with a member or members of the gambling syndicate to ILE
explore their capabilities. Mr. Maheu was known to have accounts AB.
with several prominent business men and organizations in the
Fe United States. Maheu'was to make his approach to the syndicate
Ve -as appearing to represent big business organizations which wished
to protect their interests in Cuba. Mr. Maheu accordingly met
and established contact with one John Rosselli of Los Angeles.
Mr. Rosselli showed interest in the possibility and indicated he
had some contacts in Miami that he might use. Maheu reported
that John Rosselli said he was not interested in any remuneration
but would seek to establish capabilities in Cuba to perform the
desired project. Towards the end of September Mr. Maheu and
Mr. Rosselli proceeded to Miami where, as reported Mane YG oe
introduced to Sam Giancana of Chicago. Sam Giancara arranged § , _

and forth to Havana. From information received back by the
courier the proposed operation appeared to be feasible and it
was decided to obtain an official Agency approval in this regard.

’ A figure of one hundred fifty thousand dollars was set by the Agency
as a payment to be made on completion of the operation and to be
paid only to the principal or principals who would conduct the
operation in Cuba. Maheu reported that Rosselli and Giancana
emphatically stated that they wished no part of any payment. The
undersigned then briefed the proper senior officials of this Agency

[eo the proposal. Knowledge of this project during its life was kept

to a total of six persons and never became a part of the project //
current at the time for the invasion of Cuba and there were no
memoranda on the project nor were there other written documents
or agreements. The project was duly orally approved by the said
senior officials of the Agency.

2. Rosselli and Maheu spent considerable time in Miami
talking with the courier. Sam Giancana was present during parts
of these meetings. Several months after this period Maheu told me
that Sam Giancana had asked him to put a listening device in the
room of one Phyllis McGuire, reported to be the mistress of Giancana.
At that time it was reported to me that Maheu passed the matter
] over to one Edward Du Boise, another private investigator. It
| appears that Arthur James Balletti was discovered in the act of |
i !) installing the listening device and was arrested by the Sheriff in * ~
: ' Las Vegas, Nevada. Maheu reported to me that he had referred
the matter to Edward Du Boise on behalf of Sam Giancana. At the
time of the incident neither this Agency nor the undersigned knew
of the proposed technical installation. Maheu stated that Sam
Giancana thought that Phyllis McGuire might know of the proposed
operation and might pass on the information to one Dan Rowan,
another friend of McGuire's. At the time that Maheu reported this
to the undersigned he reported he was under surveillance by agents
of the Federal Burean of Investigation, who, he thought. were
exploring his association with John Rosselli and Sam Giancana
incident to the project. I told Maheu that if he was formally ap-
proached by the FBI, he could refer them to me to be briefed that
he was engaged in an intelligence operation directed at Cuba.

¥

3. During the period from September on\through April
efforts were continued by Rosselli and Maheu to préceed with the
z he first principal in Cuba withdrew and another principal

was selected as has been briefed to The Attorney General. Ten
thousand dollars was passed for expenses to the second principal.
He was further furnished with approximately one thousand dollars
worth of communications equipment to establish communications
between his headquarters in Miami and assets in Cuba. No
monies were ever paid to Rosselli and Giancana. Maheu was
paid part of his expense money during the periods that he was in
Miami. After the failure of the invasion of Cuba word was sent
through Maheu to Rosselli to call off the operation and Rosselli
was told to tell his principal that the proposal to pay one hundred
fifty thousand dollars for completion of the operation had been
definitely withdrawn,

4. Inall this period it has been definitely established from
other sources that the Cuban principals involved never discovered
or believed that there was other than business and syndicate interest
in the project. To the knowledge of the undersigned there were no
"leaks" of any information concerning the project in the Cuban
community in Miami or in Cuba.

5. Ihave no proof but it is my conclusion that Rosselli
and Giancana guessed or assumed that CIA was behind the project.
Inever met either of them. Re

6. Throughout the entire period of the project John Rosselli
was the dominant figure in directing action to the Cuban principals.
Reasonable monitoring of his activities indicated that he gave his
best efforts to carrying out the project without requiring any com-
mitments for himself, financial or otherwise.

7. In view of the extreme sensitivity of the information

set forth above, only one additional copy of this memorandum has
been made and will be retained by the Agency.
