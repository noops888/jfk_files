MEMORANDUM FOR DIRECTOR, DDR&E
Office of the Secretary of Defense

SUBJECT: Anti-Sabotage Operations in Latin America

The Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban
Affairs (ICCOCA) has recently considered to provide
guidance to US firms in Latin America confronted with Castro-
communist inspired sabotage of their facilities and assets, has
contracted for the preparation of a report which will consolidate the
experiences of several US firms in Latin America in combatting
sabotage, After consideration by the ICCOCA this report will be

| furnished through our country teams in Latin America to local US
firms to asaist them in instituting appropriate anti-sabotage programs.

| I would be most Li ould prepare a brief report
designed to supplement hich would include enumera-

- tion of general guidelines which might be adopted by US firms in the
Latin American area in combatting sabotage. In particular, an
enumeration of known appropriate anti-sabotage devices available on
the commercial market together with the manufacturer's names would
be most helpful.

A member of my staff has discussed this project with Mr.
Pheips of your staff, who has indicated that DDR&E might be of assist-
ance in this matter based on.a recent field trip to Venezuela where
problems peculiar to that area were studied at the request of the US
Ambassador, It is also possible that commercial devices developed
for South Vietnam would have applicability in Latin America, Because
this project is designed for distribution to. several Latin American
countries, it is requested that where possible guidelines be developed
which might have general application throughout Latin America, but
with emphasis on key subversive target areas. Present plans antici-
pate finalization of this project by December 23, 1963.

into Veneguela or Colombia from the Colon Free Zone, Panama.
USCINGSO initiated surveillance at first light on 9 November 1963
to detect and track surface veesele which might be engaged in the
subversive traffic. The ICS directed the Coramander-in-Chief,
Atlantic (CINCLANT) to commence surveillance with radar equipped
aizeragt and to keep USCINCSO advised of all information. Sue-
pected craft were not positively identified or intercepted; however,
there weve indications that an unidentified surface veasel off the
Ric Hacha area of Colombia and in Colombian watere was probably
in contact with smail boats operating from the Colombian coastline
at night. ~

b.. An directed by the Joint Chicfs of Staff, USCINESO
developed a plan under which the United States could provide assist-
ance to Venenuelan forces, on three levels of participation, designed
te prevent the surreptitious movement of Castro~Coramunist arms
and personnel inte Venesuela. Yo be fully effective, the plan calls
for US elements operating from Veneauclan territery which is not
considered a likely subject for approval by the Government of
Venesuela at the pregent time,

c. A joint survey ang mobile training team of eleven men was
provided by USCINCSO to Verczuela on 22 Novamber 1963, upon
apptoval of the concept by the Government of Veneeucla. The purpose
of the team ie te train Venesuelan military personnel in organizing
and operatiag a jeint operations center; in improving capabilities
in the plotting and coordination of intelligence data, and aerial photo-
graphy; and in coordinating all Venezuelan military and paramilitary
organizations involved in surveillance and intercept operations.

7. Bifficulties Encountered in Filling Available Military
Quotas in the United States :

The failure of Latin American. countries te take full advantage
of military quotas offered has been a persistent problem. In 1962, for
example, 15 por cent of the quotas offered were unfilled. Thia unfavor~
able situation derives from many causes. Guving-the current diseab
yeau-lé pez-cent Of -uniiMed. Army quotac-have -heen duc-to inability to-
iG0t- courses pre—nequisiten;-23 pen cont -bocause ofdack-ot eufileiont.
fundej-and-33 pet-cent because-of politieal epheavales The armed forces
of the average Latin Amevican country are small, and the availability of
qualified candidates who can be spared for extended periods of obligated
service and the lack of a profeasional non-commissioned officer corps
also tends to digcourage the trataing of enlisted men in United States
schoola, since large suras from limited budgets to train enlisted men
who will remain in service only @ brief time, Another significant
deterrent is the por diem rates required by law to be paid by some
countries to service personnel sent outside theiz homeland, In
Argentina, Brasil, Golombia and Usuguay the legal rates for person-
nel serving abroad are too high to be supportable by defensa budgete;
while ia other countries, such as Bolivia and Paraguay, the standard
rates are too late to provide a reasonable living for atudente.

Outlined below is a summary of deliberations of subject sub-
committee during the meeting of October 10 at 1430 hours in Room fee
6273, New State, Agenda is at Tab A.

Agenda Item 1

Ee ¢ The Final Subcommittee Report for the months of July and
H vos. August was circulated, The report has been circulated to points of
=eontact by separate correspondence.

Agenda Item 2 Ei tiey

The Subcommittee discussed the SCCS letter which referred to
the recent trip of US students to Cuba. (Attached to enclosure 1) It was
".: apparent to all that criticism of the US could be implied from this letter,
The Chairman stated he would provide the SCCS with the substance of

, Government against the students,

b.. State will prepare a circular telegram to all Latin American
- Ambassadors requesting that an immediate review of Country Team
Emergency and Evacuation Plans be conducted to insure that plans were
adequate to meet a stepped-up campaign of Castro-inspired sabotage.

Agenda Item 4 : 7

In lieu of a written report on the Honduran guerrilla problem, :
the DOD representative proposéd a firsthand report to the Subcommittee,
Colonel Walter Hutchins, who has recently returned from assignment as
US Military Attache to Honduras, presented a review of the subversion
situation in that country and then answered questions from the Subcom-
mittee. The general thrust of Colonel Hutchins! remarks confirmed that
there has been considerable Castro subversive activity in Honduras. The
most serious inroads are achieved through communist radio and press
and communist educators. Colonel Hutchins commented that recent
guerrilla activity along the Nicaraguan border was probably limited to
» groups totaling between 100 and 200 men, He emphasized that Cuban-

trained Honduran guerrillas are successfully transiting by air through
Grand Cayman Island and British Honduras with some transiting Havana
to Jamaica via Belgrade. In response to a query from a State representa-
» tive, Colonel Hutchins pointed out that he believed that both Honduran
military and commercial interests were genuinely concerned with Castro,
subversion and that some of their leaders were perfectly capable. of
_< discerning the true nature of the communist threat to Honduras.

"Agenda Item 5

The Chairman stated that the paper for training Latin Americans
in the United States (included in the 'Krulak Report''*) was too broad in
scope for implementation by the Subcommittee and proposed that it be
. Tewritten under narrower parameters, In this regard, the Defense
representativ

Miscellaneous

The Chairman stated that preparatory actions on the Isthmian
meeting at San Salvador tentatively scheduled for the second half of
November would be held in abeyance pending further developments in
the Honduran situation.

oncern to the Brazilian Government over Cuban use of Brazil.
iS a way station for transporting subversives.

x ce. As a result of representations made to the
British Government about Cuban flights to the Cayman Islands
carrying Latin American subversives, the British developed
an administrative scheme which will effectively prohibit the
use of British Caribbean dependencies by Cubana as transit
points for passengers. The British intend to require transi
visas of passengers passing through their areas, and to :
eject appliéations: for such visas except in certain special
cases. Persons not possessing visas would be prevented from
leaving their aircraft, or would be returned to their point
of. origin.

further and to keep us advised. London reported chat neithe:
the Cuban nor the British Guiana Governments had raised the
ssue of landing rights with H.M.G.
