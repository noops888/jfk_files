According to’ statements by a senior CIA officer {n 1967, made
to the Inspector General, the Agency was instructed to develop a
capability to conduct assassinations. Termed an "executive action
capability, such a project was initiated in 1961, apparently assuming

an existing cryptoaym, ZRRIFLE. At the ‘request of the case'officer

(the same officer providing this information in 1967), a clandéstine
asset in Europe, QUWIN, was to be used in the project. The ¢ase
officer understood that QUWIN ‘had been considered in 1960 for use
in the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, but that the proposed

operation was never carried out because the designated CIA case

” officer declined the assignment.

The case officer in charge of ZRRIFLE also was involved in an
ssinate Fidel Castro, running from early 1962 to

operation to a:
mid-1963, However, QiWIN was not used in this effort, reliance
being placed instead on a Cuban exile leader. QJWIN was never

briefed on the Castro operation, according to the.officer handling

ZRRIFLE and the Castro operation.
Records do show that QJWIN was dispatched to the Congo in

1960, being there in November and December 1960, prior to the

Lumumba was stil alive, albeit under arrest, as of the middle

of January 1961, and it seems clear that QJWIN had left the Congo

in December 1960. A 19 December cable to Leopolaville authorizes
‘| his return to Luxembourg on 21 December and instructs Luxembourg

to pay him 1000 dollars for December aalary, which is the final

payment for his services on this operation. Also, headquarters was

working out the details of a Congo assignment. An 11 January 1961
headquarters memorandum, which refers to,T/A's dated 21 December
1960, states that the referenced amounts were given to QIWIN hy the
Chief of Station, Luxembourg. This suggesta that QIWIN was fn

Subsequently, it appears that QUWIN opetated in Europe trying
ito apot and assess individuals whom the Agency could use in safe-
cracking operations, in line with one of the principal missions of
FI/D. A 24 May 1962 cable to Luxembourg mentions that a decision :
was made to keep him in Europe and that the Leopoldville assignment

had been cancelled. A transfer to Baden-Baden is deemed a good

Agency officers who were handling QJWIN in Europe were almost

certainly unaware of the fact that he was being considered as an asset

by the senior Agency official who had begun to become active in

“February 1962 in the assassination plot against Castro. An undated
‘YES ONLY) memorandum from the Deputy Director (Plans) refers

to a 19 February 1962 memorandum asd’authorizes the retention of

rvices of QUWIN in activities which we have identified as

coincidential with the assassination plot against Castro. The date of
the reference memorandum coincides with the time that the senior *
Agency official became actively involved in this enterprise. A
memorandum of 27 June 1963 dealing with the further handling of
QUWIN mentions that this enterprise has been terminated, except :

In summary, it is almost certain that QUWIN had nothing at all
to do with the assassination of Lumumba, even though the contents and
language of available files are often cryptic and imprecise. If he had

been, it is highly unlikely that the number of Agency officers handling

and contemplating assigaments for him would have been so large. The

Further, good tradecraft practices would dictate that the last thing

"that would keep an individual clean would'be involvement in an

assassination plot. Although the Chief of FI/D coincidentally was
later assigned responsibility for the Gastro operation, there is
‘mo evidence to suggest that he was privy to assassination plota prior
to hig briefing in late 1961. oe

While QUWIN was considered for use in the "executive action

Based on available evidgaté it seems clear that the Agency
was in no way involved in the assassination of Lumumba. However,

in the course of our research, two aspects of the Lumumba story

surfaced that indicate Agency involvement in a plot. "In the one.

instance, our 1967 source mentioned the name of an Agency officer
_who was designated as the case officer for an assassination plot

against Lumumba, but reported that he had declined the assignment.

That officer was the originator of a 19 December 1960 cable to
‘Leopoldville in which he authorized the return of QJWIN to

Luxembourg on 2f December to await further instructions and the

‘payment of 1000 dollars to him for his December salary by the

Luxembourg Station. The last paragraph of the cable advises

Leopoldville that headquarters is working out the details of a Congo

assignment for QUJWIN, The same officer was the originator of a

31 January 1961 memorandum dealing with payments to QUWIN.

“1m the second instance, a 17 December 1960 cable from
Leopoldville deals with the activities of a newly recruited agent,
WIROGUE, whose mission was to try to spot persons for a°
surveillance team, intelligence assets (with emphasis on Orientale
Province), and paramilitary assets, The second paragraph of the
cable mentions that he resided in the same hotel as QUWIN (although

neither knew of the others CIA connection) and that he approached

added that there would be bonuses for special jobs. The cable

Sreat babe although some 1¢ assumptions can be made on the basis of

circumstantial evidence. On 19 September 1960, two members of
