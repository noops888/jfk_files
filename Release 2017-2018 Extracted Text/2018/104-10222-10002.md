Mr. Christ continues to ed. the, Applied Physics Division
in a progressive, responsive and agyresffve manner, Some
turbulence is occasionally generated by this vigorous leadership;
however, the record of solid and potential accomplishments by
his group continues to be impressive, On balance, his creative,
forward-looking leadership continues tbe a talent suited for
the goals and missions of this Office.

0

The technological innovations established in his Division
are continuing to lead to a variety of items of great potential
valve to the Intelligence Community, His aggressive search for
and application of other-agency funds has directly saved this
Agency many hundreds of thousands of dollars,

Mr. Christ will bo retLring 20 November 1979, Prior to 1970

he has generally been considered a capable officer and the list of
his accomplishments during nis Agency career is not unimpressive.
Cheist's performance, particularly in the last six months, however,
Was vevealed critical weakness in judgment, discretion and self-
evaluation, These flaws’ have been eailed to Christ's attention by
me personally, fficiently serious that were it not
for his proposed retire ould be constrained to seek other
means to separate him from Agency employment.

During the past year Mr, Christ has attempted to consolidate the large
arcas of responsibility in his Applicd Physics Division which now encompa
effort in powitive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro+
technology, und emplacement. He continues to be conscientious, responsive, ;
and aggressive in the management and development of these technical programs.
Further, during the past year giant strides have been taken in the coordination .
of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers, This coordination has
been above and beyond that required by existing Agency regulations,

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must
be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the
forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction, On occasion
his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-acceleration,
in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order. However,
his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in
} truly large steps forward in technical areas where the cost effectiveness cannot
yet be determined, His judicious application of other-agency funds has directly

: saved this Agency many hundreds of thousands of dollars. ;

Mr, Christ received a QSI for his efforts during this reporting pertod.

Mr. Christ continues to be conscientious, responsive, and alert to the needs of

planning and charting of total program | efforts in order that projects lead arco,

Mr, Christ has had an unusually difficult position in one respect, in that his

Mr, Christ has been under my direct supervision for about eighteen months,
during a continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and
Development. During most of the past year Mr, Christ has doubled as group leader
of the Radio=Physics area and has had responsibility for the tremendous growth of
a separate Audio-Physics group, both of which continue to comprise about 40% of
the effort of the Physical Sciences portion of the Office. Mr, Christ has performed
these duties in a mangerial capacity in an extremely effective manner, so that both
groups are well developed and capable of continuing growth on a self-sustaining
basis,
Mr. Christ is extremely conscientious, receptive, and alert to the needs of
the Agency in terms of thé substantive content of technical programs under his
direction and supervision, His cost consciousness is a continuing effort throughout
the year, und 1s best demonstrated by the manner in which he has reprogrammed
junds internally and reduced the costs of a number of contracts, Also, he is not one
to "rubber-stamp" approval of contractor efforts, and has called several of them

to tusk this year for what he considered efforts below what he felt their capabilities

should be,

“in, Christ has been under my direct supervision for about six months, during
la difficult period of growth, expansion, and change in the Office of Research and
During the process of reorganization of thé:Office, Mr, Christ has
emerged as acting group leader of both the Radio=Physics and Audio-Physics arcas
jof effort, which comprise about 40% of the effort in the Physical Sciences portion of
the Office, :

Considering his geographical location for the previous three years,
has done a remarkable job in orgaiizing the Radio-Physics effort and in developing a
new effort in Audio=Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the
Office, All of this required that he exercise considerable initiative and judgment in
the delegation of responsibility for existing projects and in the formulation and
organization of new projects with an extremely under=manned staff,

Mr, Christ was extremely imaginative, vigorous, enthusiastic, and responsive
lin the performance of these difficult assignments, and demonstrated very clear’
ability to manage programs and develop teamwork against these continuing and new
objectives, In the development of the orginizations necessary to implement these
programs, Mr, Christ has demonstrated a high degree of cost consciousness by.
organizing personnel of the two groups so that with a limited staff they could operate
in both programs, and by vigorously combing the country to locate the best contrac=
tors to implement the program and to seek advice as to appropriate sources for such

Subject is a technical man who combines a taste for action sully ep jonal
competence, producing excellent leadership for the specialized branch he ABs. -
His tevatment of personnel is direct, frank, unusually honest adthjugt. He
helps the men and thefr families in times of trouble and porsunal diff@iities and
has carned their respect for his technical competence: Ho 1e imaginative and
bold in his approach to the responsibilities of his branch and is a fertile source
of ideas, He has driven hard towards raising professional standards.

Although he is a good innovator, he sometimes pushco harder on new
approaches than on cumpietion of programs in being, and on occasion his
devotion to a program leads him to heavy emphasis on it and too little on other
aspects equally as important, However, this'was inthe earlier part of the
rated period rather than recently," I believe he will continue to grow with bis
job and that he can undertake more responsible and-broader assignments.
