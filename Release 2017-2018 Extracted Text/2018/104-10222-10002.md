Mr. Christ continues to ledd the, Apolled Physics Division

in a progressive, rusponsive and ageressive manner. Some

turbulence is occasionally generated by this vigorous leadership;

however, the record of solid and potential accomplishments by

his group continues to be impressive. On balance, his creative,

forward-looking leadership continues to be a talent suited for

the goals and missions of this Office.

The technological innovationg established in his Division

are continuing to lead to a variety of items of great potential

Mr. Christ will bo retiring 30 lovenber 1970.

he has generally boen considered a capable officer and the list of

Christ's performance, particularly in

the last six months,

has revealed critical weakness

in judgment, discretion and sell-

These flaws have been

to Christ's attention by

During the past year Mr. Christ has attempted to consolidate the large

arcas of responsibility in his Applied Physics Division which now encompasses

effort in positive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro-

technology, und emplacement: He continues to be conscientious, responsive,

and aggressive in the management and development of these technical programs.

Further, during the past year giant strides have buen taken in the coordination

of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers. This coordination has

been above and beyond that required by existing Agency regulations.

Mis managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must

be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the

forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction. On occasion

his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-acceleration

in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order. However,

his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in

truly large steps forward in technical arcas where the cost effectiveness cannot

During the past year, Mr. Christ has expanded his responsibilities

for his Applied Physier Division, which now encompasses effort in positive

audiosurveillance, countermeasures, micropowcr-microlehnnlogs, and

emplacement problems.

He continues to be conscientious, responsive, and

aggressive in the management and development of the technical programs

linder his direction and supervision.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities, and it

must be acknowledged that they are responsible, in large measure, for the

forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction.

Mis cost consciousness is best exemplified by his detailed planning and

charting of cost, time, and technical details in a variety of complex areas.

He has taken the lead in solving many involved, detailed and intricate interface

and coordination problems with virtually all other technical groups within the

Agency.

I expect a high degree of intelligence pay-off as a result of programs

under his supervision.

Mr. Christ has been under my direet supervision for about eighteen months,

during a continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and

Development. During most of the past year Mr. Christ has doubled as group leader

of the Radio- Physies area and has had responsibility for the tremendous growth of

a separate Audio-Physica group, both of which continue to comprise about 40% of

the effort of the Physical Sciences portion of the Office. Mr. Christ has performed

these duties in a mangerial capacity in an extremely effective manner, so that both

groups are well developed and capable of continuing growth on a self-sustaining

basis.

Mr. Christ is extremely consciontious, receptive, and alert to the needs of

His cost consciousness is a continuing effort throughout

the year, and is best demonstrated by the manner in which he has reprogrammed

funds internally and reduced the costs of a number of contracts. Also, he is not one

Nr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about six months, during

a difficult period of growth, expansion, and change in the Office of Research and

Devclopment.

Tiring the process of reorganization of the Office, Mr. Christ has

emerged as acting group leader of both the Radio-Physics and Audio Physics arcas

of eifort, which comprise about 40% of the eifort in the Physical Sciences portion of

the Office.

Considering his geographical location for the previous three jears, Mr. Christ.

has done a remarkable job in orgaitizing the Radio- Physics effort and in developing a

new effort in Audio-Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the

Office. All of this required that he exercise considerable initiative and judgment in

the delegation of responsibility for existing projects and in the formulation and

organization of new projects with an extremely under-manned staff.

Mr. Christ was extremely imaginative, vigorous, enthusiastic, and responsive

in the performance of these difficult assignments, and demonstrated very clear

ability to manage programs and develop teamwork against these continuing and new

objectives. In the development of the organizations necessary to implement these

programs, Mr. Christ has demonstrated a high degrec of cost consciousness by.

organizing personnel of the two groups so that with a limited staff they could upcrate

in both programs, and by vigorously combing the country to locate the best contrac

tors to implement the program and to seek advace as to appropriate sources for such

procurement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

THROUGH:

SUBJECT:

Deputy Director for Science and Technology

Recommendation for Quality Step Increase -

David to Christ

1. It is recommended that Mr. David L. Christ, Chief of the

Applied Physics Division, Office of Research and Development, be

granted a Quality Step Increase from GS-16, step 6, to GS-16, step 7.

2. Mr. Christ entored on cluty with the Agency on 16 November

1950. He transferred to OlD foom the DD/P as & GS-16 in September,

During the past four and one half years he has assumed

increasing responsibilities and kis expertly implemented and fulfilled

the objectives for which his Division was former in the carly growth

period of the Office. Although he has porformed equally as well, and

perhaps better than, many of his equivalent Division chiefs within the

Office, the supergrade 'f. O. limitation within the Office has prevented

a raise other than the Legislative pay raises.

3a Mi. Christ is conaidered to be a key individual in ORD.

Ilis energy, initiative, and enthusiasm in developing concepts and

applying managerial talents make his services to this Orfice invaluable.

In particular, his development of audio surveillance,
