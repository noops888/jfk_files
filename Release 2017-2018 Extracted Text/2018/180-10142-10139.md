Biography

Jhe stay was test tho

Elena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents in

action

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917.

Ms. Garro attended

charles

Thomas

the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later

did graduate work at Berkley in California and at the

University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married

to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of

Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals.

When

Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple

separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also

named Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early

life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity

about her native land and had a reputation for being one

if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena

was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of

Mexican life and made an important contribution to its

artistic development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El' Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.

Ms. Garro's

short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores.

The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, "a

splendid success." Critics have said of her:

"For

Elena Garro, there is no frontier between reality and

fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality-

perhaps more intense to which one may penetrate without

passport or forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of

a literature fired with passion, flavor and life."

Many

people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier

between reality and fantasy is also, difficult for her to

distinguish in real life. [Biography Date Form plata, An

prepared by Charles Thamas I

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

the Confederacion Nacional Campesina (CNC) , the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI) • Because Ms. Garro

a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the

poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms

with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders. from all

over the country. (ilia)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political

connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-

attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with her daughter, Elenita

and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

The House seleet Committee on Assassinations has been unable to

determine the exact reason MarGarro had In fleeing Mexico.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been

friendly with Embassy officers. Her broad range of signifi-

cant personal friends, the views of many important to the

American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target. Through-

out the early 1960's she was carried as a target in the

Embassy's Youth Program.

American Embassy employees dealing with Elena

believed that despite her access to the underground happenings

in Mexico, including peasant most, since she had a tendency

while shereported,

who had recently returned from living in France. He was

unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it was

occurred as they were leaving the party about 2:00 a.m.

because of publicity following the assassination of President

Kennedy but otherwise had no knowledge of him and had never

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political officer

at the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a

conversation with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587,

with Elena had been about other matters but she mentioned

knowing Oswald. Thomas noted that she was reluctant to

talk but did. (,bid)

that Silvia Duran had been "Oswald's mistress while he

forwarded

On February 3, 1966 Anne Goodpasture sebt Thomas' December 25,1965

memo to the Cuban section with an attached note asking

them to check whether Elena was "seen creating such a

disturbance as they claimed in front of the Cuban

Embassy. " (Note from Ann Goodpasture to "Cubans",

2/3/66, CIA No. 579; WX-7241, Entry 428, P. 94, CIA #721.)

One Cuban section officer responded, "No bells

ring with me." Another one wrote "Me neither." The

third officer wrote "No pictures either." (IBID.) There

is no indication that the penetration agents in the Cuban

Embassy were queried about this.

Elena's allegation

(IBID; That there are

no pictures is reasonable since Elena claimed that the

event happened: 1.)

on a Saturday at 3:00 p.m. when

the Cuban Embassy was not normally photographically

surveilled; and

2.): the "disturbance" occured inside the

Cuban compound. HSCA Examination of the CIA Cuban Embassy

photographic surveillance showed no surveillance on 11/23/63.

EJL First Draft

House Select Committee on Assassination

Investigation of Elena Garro's Allegations

The House Select Committee on Assassinations

investigated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews

and personal interviews. The Committee requested and

reviewed the CIA's, FBI's and State DepartmentsFiles, when

avarable

they existed, on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz,

Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp,

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia Duran,

Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio Azcue,

and Emilio Carballido. Only the Elena Garro de Paz file

contained information

on her allegations. Though all the

names

listed above played a role in Elena Garro de Paz'

story, not one of their files included a reference to

Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore,

the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence

Agency's [LICOOKIE I) (LICHANT 1), [LIRING 3, [LIHUFF I and

[TICHBORN files.

Once again not one of the files included

a mention of Elena Garro's allegations. The House Select

Committee on Assassinations learned that LICOOKIE I was

June Cobb Sharp who first reported Elena's allegation. (Supra

p. 4)

The Committee also learned that LICHANT I was Manuel Calvillo

who hid Elena Garro and her daughter in

a hotel

Since a file review lon nomen, the committee

decided to arrange interviews in Mexico with Sylvia Duran,

Elena Garro, Elenita Garro, Horacio Duran, Ruben Duran,

Mexican Government informed as that Elena and Elenita

The others were interviewed between

therefore did not attend any of the twist parties at the

Duran homes.
