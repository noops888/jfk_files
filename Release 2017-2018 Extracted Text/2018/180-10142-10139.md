the National Autonomous University of Mexico and later
did graduate work at Berkley in California and at the
University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been married
to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of
Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals. When
Octavio’ was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple
separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also
named Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early
life in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity
about her native land and had a reputation for being one
if its more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena
was considered emotionally committed to many aspects of
Mexican life and made an important contribution to its
artistic development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El’ Rey Mago, La Senhora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,
where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.
Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porvenir, "a

splendid success." ,Critics have said of her: "For

Elena Garro, there is no frontier between reality and
fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality--
perhaps more intense-- to which one may penetrate without
Passport or forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of

a literature fired with passion, flavor and 1ife.* " many
people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier
between reality and fantasy is also difficult Bat her to
distinguish in real Life. Couscepty bt Ferm ”punsies by charts tes]

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

e
the Confederacion Nacional Campesina (CNC), the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro
was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the
poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms
with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders. from all
over the country. ( uct)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated
woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright
opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers
in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political
connections rendered her fairly immune from serious counter-
attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the
country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been
friendly with Embassy officers. Her broad range of signifi-
cant personal friends, the views of many important to the

American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target.) Through-

out the early 1960's she was carried as a target in the
Embassy's Youth Program. .

Elena was questioned regarding the identity of other

might have been in a position to observe the three americans.

business card which identified the young man as Ario Alejandro

The House Select Committee on Assassinations
investigated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews
and personal interviews. The Committee requested and

Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp,
Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia Duran,
Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio Azcue,
and Emilio Carballido. only the Elena Garro de Paz file
contained information on her allegations. Though all the
names listed above played a role in Elena Garro de Paz!
story, not one of their files included a reference to
Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence
