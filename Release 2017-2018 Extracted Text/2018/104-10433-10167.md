FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

In observance of the tenth anniversary of Fresident Kennedy's deats,

the Committee to Investigate Assassinations is sponsoring a two-day

Conferance at Georgetown University on November 23rd and 24th.

A

brochure describing the Conference and its program is attached. As

you will note, several of the Nation's prominent walters and Investi-

gators of the assassinations of the pást decade vill speak.

While a number of different points of view on the subject will be

represented, there is general consensus that the Executive Branch has

failed to make known all the relevant facts of the assassinations..

He believe that the Congress must ultimately take the initiative lE

the public is to learn all of the facts, and that Watergate has shown

us that Congreas' action depends largely, on disclosures by an informed

press and other news media.

A press pass will be available for you at the conference registration

desk. For further information, please contact:
