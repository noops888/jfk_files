FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

-
In observance of the tenth anniversaty of President Kennedy's death,
the Comittee to Investigate Assassinations is sponsoring a two-day
Conference at Georgetown University on November 23rd and 24th. A
brochure desertbing the Conference and its program 1s attached. .Aa
you will note, seve¥al of the Nation’s prominent writers and investi-

gators of the assassinations of the past decade will speak.

While a number of different points of view on the subject will be
represented, there is general consensus that the Executive Branch has
failed to make knova all the relevant fects of the assassinations...
We believe that the Congress must ultinately take the initiative 1f
the public is to learn all -of the facts, and that Watergate has shown
us that Congress’ action depends largely on disclosures by an informed

> press and other news media. .

A press paso will be available for you at the Conference registration
