_iTION

RE:

CUBANOS UNIDOS

(UNITED CUBANS)

gasoline storage plants and electric plants in Cuba.

However, CU has not formalized these plans, and they are

not expected to take place within the immediate future.

NAVARRO explained that he had been, appearing

on radio and television programs in the Miami, Florida,

area,

calling for unity of Cuban exile groups and urging these

independent groups to join CU for military operations

against Cuba.

NAVARRO said that CU takes

the propaganda

position that it is against any United States help and aid

and will liberate Cuba without United States arms,

backing

or recognition.

NAVARRO explained the purpose of this

policy is to unite the Cuban exiles, but privately CU is

to obtain United States Government help and backing.

On June 23, 1970, MM T-I advised that certain CU

members claim that they had located a good boat, about

sixty feet long with a steel hull and two motors.

The boat

is owned by an unidentified American.

MM T-1 explained

that from the contents of the conversation, it appeared

that the CU members planned on contacting the American

owner of the boat to ascertain if arrangements could be

made for CU to use this boat for operations against Cuba.

(2) fon June 26, 1970, MM T-2, a Cuban exile who has

five years.

Involved un carto revolutionary matters for the past

on the night previously, he had

conferred with WILFREDO NAVARRO, at which time NAVARRO

claimed CU was going ahead with its plans to sink a

Soviet vessel off the east coast of Florida as the vessel

was on its way to Cuba.

NAVARRO: indicated that CU had no

particular vessel in mind, but that when plans were completed

they would attempt to sink the first Russian vessel that

happened to come

along.

On June 29, 1970, MM T-l reported that he received

information that CU was preparing some type of military

action against ships trading with Cuba.

This action would

involve an attack on a ship on the high seas and possibly

a ship of Russian registry.

The leaders of this operation

are WILFREDO NAVARRO and GORDON DI BATTISTO, an American.

CU reportedly had two 20mm cannons, two .50 caliber

machine guns, and an unidentified boat, owned by an

American, not further identified.
