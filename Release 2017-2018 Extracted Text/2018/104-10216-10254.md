q. 2. Fidel Castro Ruz is against sending Cubans as guerrillas to

| : Venezuela or any other Latin American Country,. Since being con-
demned by the Organization of American States Castro is more

' cautious; nevertheless he continues to support the FALN and other

H revolutionary groups in Latin America, It is rumored that some

i money and possibly arms are being channeled to the FALN through
Ben Bella and Algeria,

Cuban Government officials Source gained the impression that
the FALN is possibly the Primary recipient of Cuban support;
the prize for Castro is big, but the more important reason
for supporting the FALN is its fairly effective organization,
which continues to operate in Venezuela,
