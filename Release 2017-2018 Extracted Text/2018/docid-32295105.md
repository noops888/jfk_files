of Ray to effect an operation inside Cuba, JURE had suffered a psycho-
logical letdown. This letdown has been ioetnest by Ray's July, 1964
failure to infiltrate Cuba. In July of 196 Ray was stopped by US
Customs AgentS at Key West, Florida, and in a subsequent attempt to go
to Cuba, he was stopped by the US Coast Guard. Rogelio Cisneros, head

In connection with the request mentioned in the preceding
reference, Manuel Ray Rivero was contacted on 9/25/64 at the home of
his father (not named) at 3802 N.W, 19th Ave., Miami, Florida. Ray .
advised JURE had nothing whatsoever to do with the attack on the
"Sierra Aranzazu" on 9/13/64. He said it was contrary to the belief
and rule of JURE, which was to fight Castro from within Cuba. Ray
said he had no information concerning the identity of those responsible
for the attack. Ku)

On 9/25/64, Manuel Varéla Castro, 149 Hast 3rd St., Hialeah,

sible for JURE to have conducted the attack. JURE had no boats in
operation. The launch "True," previously used .by Ray to secretly enter
Cuba (date not given) had been sold, JURE ship "Venus" was in dry

On 9/4/64, Manuel Ray Rivero advised that JURE had suffered
some setbacks but still planned to infiltrate into Cuba before the..end
of 1964. Ray said that the recent resignations of leading individuals
and groups from JURE was a weeding-out process, and in ‘the best interest
of the organization. Ray claimed to have representatives in and cooper-
ation from the Dominican Republic. .

On 9/28/64, Carlos A. Zarraga Martinez (protect identity)
advised that he was previously in charge of supplies for JURE. Zarraga
charged that Ray workéd in’ an autocratic manner, lacked organization
ability, and insisted on being the "star" of the organization,

Zarraga advised that he and a small action group resigned
from JURE in June,,1964, as he felt that Ray had failed. Several other
independent groups joined Zarraga and his group. Their thesis was to
be "left of center" and would follow the thinking of Ray.
