topics but dealt principally with, Afigzican political

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary
veference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing
the limited nuclear test ban. there were differences in
the replay by united states newspapers like the
New York Times and Washington papers, with a@ result that
CASTRO'S "message" was significantly modulated,

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of: Séptember 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morni aper, the Tim icayune,
Sean the principal morning p: fimes-Picayune
on Monday, 9 September;-page-p, under a three-colunmn head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

imperiled by Aid to Rebels." the story followed under the
HARKER by-line: ,

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,
used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference
to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real
significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated re~

22Y xeference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

on 7 November 1963, the Cuban Third Secretary,
Ricardo L. SANTOS Pesa, discussed the recent refugee raids
on Cuba and their implications with a host-country diplomat,
concluding with the admonition: * ... gust wait ana you
will see what we can do. It will happen soon." Asked to
be more specific what would happen soon, SANTOS replied:
"gust wait, just wait."

24. The defects viewed in Hindsight of the Silvia DURAN
testimony already have been suggested above. (In that
context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider
the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations
on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS,
and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquim Hernandez ARMAS,
because the thrust of the conversation dealt with the ques-
tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about [or been

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her
Cuban Embassy job. In the spring of 1967 Silvia DURAN
was reported by a reliable and sensitive source to have .~
cut all relations with Cubans. Her account, in 1967, of
