Review of Selected Items in the

Lee Harvey OSWALD File Regarding Allega-

tions of CASTRO Cuban: Involvement in the

John F. KENNEDY Assassigation

Letter by David W. Belin to

paragraph 5 (Regarding Papric State

(Begatding Public Statement

by CASTRO,

, attached

BACKGROUND

I. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana;: even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There: can be, no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular president KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordinazal

„provocative fashion

(" ... KENNEDY is acretin

2b" ... the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of september 1963, the HARKER Story

appeared in the principal morning papere the Times-Picayune,

on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-colunn head-

line:

"CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba.

Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story

followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.s.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba.'

"Bitterly denoancing what he called

tory, Castro said: Weare prepared to

October crisis. They have been broken as can

be seen with new attacks.

"'But. I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to

a worse

crisis than October's ...'"

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance. The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed_the HARKER

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the

paper lo september 1969 bage 8-4) and revorded the content

of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-

Litical aspeat

- in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER

elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNED*

assassination).that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headquarters attention te their story very shertly after

the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba. There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mi. Belin's

reguest, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

öf the review, admittedly heavily using the 20--20 quality

of hindsight, may be stiR

ulated in summary:

a.

There is no increment of credible

evidence, appiying this phrase strictly, of

soviet anavor Cuban political, intelligence

or security service involvement in the as-

sassination to what was developed and con-

sidered by the Warren Commission and its

staff. The Commission's finding that

Lee HarveY OSWALD was the killer of

President KENNEDY and Officer TIPPIT and did

them in alone and of his own determination

stands.

b. "Credible evidence" that would

upset or significantly modify this juagement

did (and does) not exist in Washington. But

such evidence could exist in Moscow and/of

Havana, whose voluntary inputs to the warren

Commission were minimal in quantity and

quality, designed to cover up any admissions

of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD

which might be related directly or indirectly

with the assassination. Therefore, the belief

that there was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB andor

DGI) connection with OSWALD with persist and

The warren Commission Report takes note of this:

"OSWALD, tOVE DELGADO that he was in

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected by the

Language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down of developed by investigation. Thus,

the record of the beginning of OSWALD's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a question mark.

11. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban

13. DELGADO's testimony has the cast of credibility.

Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention

on the male visitor who contacted OSWALD at El Toro Camp

and talked with him for between one and a half to two hours.

The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually

there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else

we know about OSWALD's activity in the United States before

or after his return to the United States.

The record reflects

no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presump-

tion is that he was from the Cuban Consulate in Los Angeles.

Assuming that, the questions are: Who was it, and was

there reporting from los Angeles to Washington and

Havana

INTERCEPTED: CONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE,

LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

18.

At 1730 Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from

an uniden-

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest

news. "Luisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of course, I knew

it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians!

..."

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination.

"Luisa"

also stated that the party

at

Silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would

they have the party coincide with the burial. Finally she

said sherplanned to nove that night into the house of a

friend.

21. Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto suggestion

of foreknowledge? This is the only item in the intercept

coverage of the Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknowledge or expectation.

22. The tenuous, enigmatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

a. _ "Juisa" was probably identical with

Luisa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban

Directorate, Genéral of Intelligence (DGI).

she returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headquarters.

b.

The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963). The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'5

successor

c. The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist,

a Mexican

national, who dealt

with OSWALD during his known

visits on 27 and 28

September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

record regarding OSWALD's activity in

Mexico City. Her testimony, however, in its

entirety was taken and presented, solely, by the

Mexican Governmental authorities. A direct

confrontation with her was reguested by the

warren Commission staff but rejected by the

Mexican authorities. It is from Silvia DURAN's

statements that it was learned that OSWALD

becamesengaged in a personal altercation on

27 September with Eusebio AZCUE.

₫. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

alias Marcos, and his GI assistant,

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively

identified in February 1964 by two independent

sources as engaged in the active development

and facilitation of the training of Nicaraguan

agents for the purpose of assassinating

General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, it is estab-

lished, was on post in Mexico City during

OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October

1963. He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally

Silvia DURÁN was subjected to a systematic elicitative

interrogation that would have related

cupin DeI, its personalities and methods, in

considering the fuss he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the

applications to be handled

solely by a local employee and

a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

were not asked at the time. And there remains the more

fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

face, could it have happened without the knowledge and

participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This

seems unlikely

especially because VEGA is later sited by

a Cuban: DGI defector as having stated he was aware OSWALD

made several visits to the Cuban Consulate. It is clear

relations from Dallas during the period 19 April -

on 13 February 1963.

24. The defects viewed in hindsight of the Silvia DURAN

testimony already have been

suggested above. (In that

context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider

the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations

on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS.

and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaguim Hernandez ARMAS,

because the thrust of the conversation dealt with the ques-

tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about lor been

offered?] money payments by her Mexican interrogators.)

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her

Cuban Embassy job. In the spring of 1967 Silvia DURAN

was reported by a reliable and sensitive source to have

cut all relations with Cubans. Her account, in 1967, of

how she had been taken into custody and had been interrogated

after the assassination repeated what was already known.

Mexico city: ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the

use of the polygraphsion which ALVARADO showed evidences of

deception, and by bringing ALVARADO's former Nicaraguan

security service contras) into the case.

28. The ALVARADa stOry 1s a particularly acute repre-

sentation of,

the difficulties that beset the evaluation of

observed endence: certain elements of the story persist

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,

whose account did not becone public until the release of

the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of;

the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a Negro

with red-dyed hair.

29. Elena GARRO de Paz is a mecurial,

Biculate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN, the husband of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Communism:

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what. had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

31. The first reference to the GARRO story was noted in

a Mexico Station Memorandum of Record dated 12 October 1964:

"Elena GARRO [saidl that she and her

daughter were invited to a party at the cuban

Embassy during the period she now finds out

that Oswall was here in Mexico prior to the

assassination: She was invited by a Mexican

secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband

is a cousin of the GARRO family (Horacio DURAN].

At the party she saw three Gringos, not

drinking, not mixing and more or less just

standing around together like three bumps on a

1og. They were so obviously out of place that

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was told that 'they were just passing

through.' She claims that on the way these

three Gringos stood out she took a good l00k

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWAID's picture was

spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos 'without a doubt' at the

party."

32. GARRO Iepeated her story to Mr. Charles William

THOMAS, an Embassy political officer on 10 December 1965:

brothers of Horacio DURAN, who married her cousin. she

met oswald, and two other young americans. At the party

she was discouraged from talking with him. Other guests

were the Cuban Consul AZCUE, General Clark FLORES,

Silvia DURAN, who she later learned was OSWALD's mistress

while he was here, Emilio CARBALLIDO and a Latin American

Negro man with red hair [emphasis addedl. In November 1963

when the identity of the assassin became known, she and

her daughter went to the Cuban Embassy and

shouted

"assassins" and other insults at the staff there.?

Shortly

afterward, she and her daughter were visited by a friend,

Manuel CARVILIO [or CALVILIO], then an official in the

Secretariat of thie Gobernacion and were told he had orders

to escort them to a smalliand obscure hotel in the center

an certain particulars signiticantly modified her earlier

account. She also acknowledged that she and her daughter

had been Daterviewed by Embassy officers to whom she claimed

the did not give a very complete story because the

Embagsy affiages dia not appear to give much credence

anything they said.

34. It developed that GARRO and daughter had been

interviewed by the legal Attache en 11and 21 Navember 1261.

Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her

account to THOMAS but had not been substantlated: by, inquiries.

The FBI representative therefore considered the matter closed

and reaffirmed his disengagement from the matter to the CIA

Chief of Station on 27 December 1964 and to the Ambassador

on 25 February 1965.

35. The Embassy POlitical Officer, however, persisted in

his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of conversation,

13 July 1966, GARRO identified the place to which she had been

taken by CALVILLO as the Hotel Vermont.

(This detail checked

out affirmatively. GARRO was at the Hotel 23 - 24, 25 - 27

and 28 - 30 Movember 1963. In another, on 7 February 1967,

36. There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the

events she described as having occurred in the Mexican capital

in September 1963 never coincided with the confirmed data

of OSWALD's presence there: Her story, however, had two

points.congguant with allegations by others regarding

OSWALD:

a. ALVARADO's allegations regarding the

Negro with

the red-dyed hair [this detail could,

however, have been gleaned from the

Warren Commission's published account of the

"D" casel and

b. Silvia DURAN's later claim of

intimate personal contacts with OSWALD

37. Beginning in March and amplified

1967, the

American Consul, Benjamin J. RUYLE, in Tampico developed a

contact with a local Mexican journalist,

Oscar CONTRERAS Lartigue, who claimed to have encountered

OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the

University of Mexico campus in September 1963.

38. In June 1969 CONTRERAS was interviewed by a CIA

officer:

He studied law at the University of Mexico

for three years,

approximately 1960 - 1964. He

belonged

to a clandestine pro-CASTRO

revolutionary

group at the University.
