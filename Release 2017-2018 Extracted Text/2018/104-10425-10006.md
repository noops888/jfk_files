Memorandum For: CI/RMO

Subject: FOI Request Regarding List of West to East
Defectors, Including Lee H. OSWALD.

1. Paul L. HOCH, who has previously requested
information on Lee H. OSWALD and on the Assassination
of President kennedy, has now submitted a request to
the National Archives for the release of a 1960
memorandum from the Department of State to CIA.
Attached to the memorandum was a list of 12 US defectors
to Communist countries.

2. The Department of State has reviewed the
document and has made its decision as follows:

a. Thetemrandua can be declassified,
but CIA should be involved in the decision because the
memorandum contains mention of DCID 4/2 and one of its
provisions.

b. The list attached to the memorandum
should not be released to the public domain because it
contains subjective judgements regarding US citizens
and thus could constitute an invasion of privacy. The
Department lists three exceptions to this point:
William MARTIN, Bernon MITCHELL, and Lee H. OSWALD.

3. We suggest that CIA concur with the Department
of State, except as follows:

a. The memorandum should be released,

except for the sentence beginning with “Using the defi-
nitions of DCID 4/2",

name should be sought from NSA, the Agency for whom they
worked at the time of their defection.
