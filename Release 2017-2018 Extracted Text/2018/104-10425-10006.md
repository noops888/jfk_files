Paul a Hoch, who has previously requested

information on Lee H. OSWALD and on the Assassination

H. OS ALD

of President kennedy, has now subnitted a request to

the National Archives for the release of a 1960

memorandun from the Department of State to CIA.

Attached to the nemorandum was a list of 12 US defectors

to Comnunist countries.

2. The Department of State has reviewed the

document and has made its decision as follows:

The merrandur can be declassified,

but CIA should be involved in the decision because the

memorandum contains mention of DCID 4/2 and one of its

provisions.

b. The list attached to the memorandum

should not be released to the public donain because it

contains subjective judgements regarding US citizens

and thus could constitute an invasion of privacy. The

Department lists three excoptions to this point:

William MARTIN, Bernon MITCHELL, and Lee H. OSWALD.

5.

Remarks: This document is from the Warren Commission RG. State/INR

sent it to the Agency earlier, but later decided that the clearances should

be obtained by NARS.

(It's also being sent to the FBI.) I don't believe

that it was revieved by you the first time around. You'll note that, with

the exception of three names, State has denied the release of the "List of

American Defectors.!'

If our Agency objects to any additional materials being

released, we will be the official deniers--but only tor those materiels.
