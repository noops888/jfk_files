This letterhead memorandum has been classified
“CONFIDENTIAL” because it contains information from informants
. of continuing value. Unauthorized disclosure of this infor-
mation could result in compromising these sources and affect,
the national defense. . Spat

General WESSIN's letter to HECTOR GARCIA GODOY was.
translated by Miami translator SOPHIE SALIBA.

General WESSIN was interviewed on 9/15/65 and
9/17/65 by SAs EDWARD J. DAHL and EUGENE L. PAYNE in the
Spanish language inasmuch as WESSIN ¢laims to speak no English.

WESSIN expressed admiration for the Bureau as the
only serious agency in Florida. He stated he would be avail-
able for future interviews by Bureau representatives.

. | ,
WESSIN appears tired and remote. He is undoubtedly
bitter, as expressed in several press releases, toward U.S. =
authorities since he believes the U. S. betrayed his efforts
in the Dominican Republic.

As noted in the enclosed letterhead memorandun,

ESSIN on 9/15/65 was encountered at the residence of ANTONIO
NO MONTES, in company with Cuban exile MARCOS DIAZ LANZ,
ile 105-80115. On 9/17/65, MARCOS DIAZ LANZ and FRANK
ZORINI, Bufile 2-1499, were observed in contact with General
WESSIN. On 9/17/65, LLANO MONTES advised that individuals,
mostly Cuban exiles whom he has not been in contact with for
mere than three years, ‘have continually. appeared at his
residence or telephonically contacted him in an effort to
gain access to General WESSIN. WESSIN has been thus occupied
during most of his waking hours with these contacts, as well
as with widespread representatives of local and national :
press, radio and telévision. This situation will more than
likely continue for some time. Because of the situation

garding DIAZ LANZ and FRANK FIORINI, as described in the
enclosed letterhead memorandum, it is possible that WESSIN’s
attitudes will undergo a change if and when he perceives |
their intention to exploit WESSIN's own anti-communist. -
ambitions. :

‘RE: GENERAL ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN

INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
OMLASsiFIgD "SLAM.
o_L--7g

On September 12, 1965, MM T-1, a confidential source
abroad, advised as follows:

fir bey,
ISSIFICATY

General ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN, commanding officer of

the Central de Ensenanzarde las Fuerzas Armadas (CEFA) (Armed
Forces Training Center), was retired, appointed Dominican
Consul General in Miami, and sent out of the Dominican
Republic (DR) to Panama on the night of September 9, 1965.
Indications were that WESSIN was to travel from Panama to
Miami and it was expected that he would be joined by his
family in Miami by September 12, 1965, According to MM T-1,
WESSIN has stated that had not United States troops landed in
the DR in April, 1965, the country would have been lost to
communism. According to information available to MM T-1 on
September 9,.1965, WESSIN was visited by Brazilian General

' HUGO ALVIN, Commanding General of the Inter-American Peace
Force, and General BRUCE PALMER, Commanding General of U. S.
Forces, DR. This visit was made at the express instructions ‘
of American Ambassador ELLSWORTH BUNKER, American Representa-
tive to the OAS Committee in the DR. It appears that ALVIN
and PALMER directed an ultimatum to WESSIN to depart the DR. KO

The September 15, 1965 edition of the "Miami News ,"
a local daily newspaper, carried an article entitled, "Bayonet
Forced Me - Wessin." This article attributes WESSIN with
alleging that an American -lieutenant put a bayonet in his back
and forced him out of his country and carried WESSIN's
rejection of a consulate post in Miami. The article quoted
WESSIN as saying, ''The American official who ordered my
expulsion in such a humiliating way has given the coup de
grace to the fight for democracy in Latin America." This
article further contained excerpts from a letter purportedly
written by WESSIN to the Dominican Provisional Presiden
HECTOR, GARCIA GODOY. 2-I4FVIS—

GENERAL ELIAS WESSIN Y. WESSIN

On September 15, 1965, General ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN
was located at his temporary residence, the home of ANTONIO
LLANO MONTES, 751 Swan Avenue, Miami Springs, Florida.

On May 19, 1965, MM T-2, a Cuban exile
familiar with activities in the Miami Cuban
colony in Miami, Florida, and acquainted with
certain phases of pro and anti-CASTRO activities
throughout Latin America; advised that ANTONIO
LLANO MONTES was the editor of a monthly magazine
entitled "Carteles," which was then published in
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. MM T-2
described this magazine as anti-CASTRO in tone,
whose director was listed as RAFAEL BONILLA AYBAR.
The Miami editor at that time was listed as
VICENTE S, PUJALS.

On September 15, 1965, General ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN
advised Special Agents of the FBI as follows:

He does not intend to accept a consular post in
Miami, Florida, which was assigned to him by Brazilian General
HUGO: ALVIN at the time he was deported from the DR.  WESSIN
‘stated that the details of his expulsion from the DR were
essentially connect as reported by the local press, to wit:

He 1 was approached by Generals DEAN and PALMER of
the U._S.: Armed Forces and Brazilian General HUGO ALVIN, the
ever-all military commander in the DR. His offices were
surrounded by armed units/of the U. S. Armed Forces and he
was directed by General ALVEN. to relinquish his command to
his first subordinate. Because of the display of armed
force, WESSIN realized that to resist would have meant
additional bloodshed in the DR and undoubtedly, would
result in the wounding or death of his own troops, who
he believed would have remained loyal to him. Recognizing
the futility of resistance and to save his own troops, he
relinquished his command as ordered.

WESSIN stated that United States Generals DEAN
and PALMER advised him that the "constitutionalist" forces

Docld:32299996 Page 6


GENERAL ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN

under the command of General FRANCISCO CAAMANO had demanded
his departure from the DR as a basis for further negotiations
to settle the Dominican crisis, WESSIN thus believes that

the United States acceded to these demands by the “communists.”
WESSIN .pointed.out that although he referred to CAAMANO

forces as "communist," United States military officials
referred to them as “constitutionalist™ forces.

WESSIN fears the rapid expansion of communist
influence in the DR and cited as an example the appointment
on September.16, 1965, of MIGUEL SOTO as Secretary of Labor.
This individual is a supporter of JUAN BOSCH and has made
public statements which WESSIN believes reveal his communist
ideals. WESSIN, however, could not recall the specific text
of these statements and emphasized that while he had no
documented proof of SOTO's communist affiliation, he never-
theless considered him as at least a communist sympathizer.

Another example of expanding communist influence
in the DR is. typified by the present Director of Passports,
name unknown, who is believed by WESSIN to be communist
because he instructed the deletion from Dominican. passports
of a stamped prohibition of travel to iron curtain countries.

WESSIN pointed out that his immediate future plans
consisted of remaining in Miami, Florida, and awaiting his
family from the DR. He has no intention of accepting the
consular post proffered to him by the Dominican provisional
government. He intends to live off of a pension awarded to
him. as a retired military officer.

- It is noted that on September 15, 1965, Special
Agents of the FBI observed that MARCOS DIAZ LANZ was in
contact with General WESSIN at the residence of ANTONIO
LLANO MONTES. On September 17, 1965, DIAZ LANZ was again
observed in contact with General WESSIN, along with FRANK
FIORINI. -

On September 17, 1965, MM T-3, a Cuban
exile who is personally acquainted with MARCOS ‘
DIAZ LANZ and FRANK FIORINI, advised as tortow: yl)

GENERAL ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN

MARCOS DIAZ is the brother of PEDRO
LUIS DIAZ LANZ, former chief of the Cuban
-Air Force under FIDEL CASTRO. MARCOS DIAZ .
LANZ defected from Cuba at the same time as
his brother PEDRO, when PEDRO d mced CASTRO
as a Communist in about 1960. 70D)

MM T-3 has known FRANK FIORINI for
approximately six or seven years and described
FIORINI as a U. S&S. citizen closely associated
with the DIAZ brothers in anti-CASTRO activities
since 1959, Previous to 1959, FIORINI associated
with the DIAZ brothers in smuggling weapons into
Cuba on b if of FIDEL CASTRO during the BATISTA
regime. i) :

MM T-3 described both MARCOS DIAZ LANZ and
FRANK FIORINI as individuals who have become pro-
fessional opportunists and who have attempted to
enrich themselves by associating with anti-CASTRO
and anti-communist elements. At the present time,
MARCOS DIAZ LANZ is in desperate financial straits.
It is the opinion of MM T-3 that the significance
of MARCOS DIAZ LANZ* and FRANK FIORINI's contacts
with General ELIAS WESSIN relates to their intention
of exploiting the resources and facilities 0:
General WESSIN for their own personal gain. 7D)

On September 17, 1965, General ELIAS WESSIN advised
Special Agents of the FBI as follows:

The newspaper article stating that he was deported
from the DR at bayonet point is a figure of speech but WESSIN
reiterated that he was forcibly retired and deported, WESSIN
indicated that a newspaper article indicating that he
intended to move to Puerto Rico and organize Dominicans
against the provisional Dominican government is without
fact since he did not release this information to the press
and has no plans at the present time other than to await
the arrival of his family in Miami, Florida. WESSIN made
available a letter that be directed to the provisional
leader of the Dominican government, HECTOR GARCIA GODOY.

A translation of this letter is as follows:

"Dr. HECTOR GARCIA GODOY

Provisional President of the Pominican Republic
National Palace i

Santo Domingo

"Mr. President:

"Y am writing this letter a few hours after my
-arrival in Miami in order to explain clearly and
definitely my position in regard to the recent events
in which I.found myself involved.

"The Dominican people are aware that, thanks to
my loyalty during the grave events which began on
April 24, our country is not completely dominated by
Communism at this time.

"An elementary sense of honor as a military man
prevents me from accepting the position of Consul
General in Miami for a Government which has availed
itself of foreign troops to send me into exile by
force. I told this to Generals ALVIN and. PALMER
when they notified me that ~ was Consul in Miami.

"The afternoon that Generals ‘ALVIN and PALMER
informed me that I was to leave and a Lieutenant
in the United States Army prevented me from going
to my héuse to pick up my clothes and my passport,
I firmly decided that I would not serve your
Government, either in the Consulate of Miami or
in any other position.

"Never did I imagine that a military man of

my rank would be taken to the airport dressed in

‘ full. uniform and taken out of the country with a
bayonet at his back.

"The United States officials who ordered my
departure from Dominican territory in such a
humiliating manner have dealt the death blow to
the fight for Democracy in America. Can you
imagine the effect that this action against my
person by the 0.A.5S. and the United States
Government will have on the military men of. Latin
America?

"Do you believe that the military men of
Latin America will be. disposed to fight against
Communism when: they know that they will be paid
for doing their duty by being expelled from their
country and.ousted from their military career?

“When the United States troops. arrived in the
Dominican Republic, after the men under my command
had been violently attacked by a Communist crowd,
seeking vengeance and death, 3 never imagined that
those same troops, making common cause with the
enemies of Democracy would remove me from my country
in'a way which does little credit to those who call
themselves the leaders in the fight for the survival
of the Western World.

"I arrived in Miami without a passport, without
money and with a suit given to me. by the soldiers
at Fort Amador in Panama, but I still have my dignity
and my name. Men who are fighting for an ideal can-
not be destroyed, and even theiugh they may be
physically eliminated that ideal will reamin
inalterable.

"I have always been an honest soldier and the
U..S. Intelligence services know that for they have
searched all the banks in the world for evidence to
besmirch my reputation,

"At this moment, I find myself obliged to break
up my home,to sell my furniture amd my house arid to
leave my family. In order to maintain that home
which I will have to start up again in exile, I have

"only the pension to which I am entitled after
.21 years of service in the Armed ichathaed of my
‘country.

"My departure from my country presages grave
events for the cause of Democracy, What self-
respecting Dominican will. be disposed to assume
responsibilities when Communism launches its final
attack against our country?

"At the present time, the world is fighting
for survival in the face of the Communist threat,
and it is necessary for men with deep convictions
to assume the defense of Democracy. Those men can-
not be destroyed in order to satisfy political
ambitions, nor in order to appeasé Communism,
without leading us to total destruction.

"My departure from my country will be a
disgraceful page in the political history of the
Dominican Republic and for its governing officials,
who, like yourself, are responsible for it. No
Dominican can remain unmoved by such a monstrous
deed, andthe day will come when the truth will
win out against treachery and deceit.

"I repeat to you that ¥ cannot accept the
appointment as Consul General, in Miami, because
it would mean serving a Government which has
betrayed Dominican Democracy, and it would mean
being disloyal to the brave soldiers and officers
who accompanied me during those tragic days when
blood flowed over the soil of our country.

"I cannot betray those soldiers and officers
of the Armed Forces because that would be an act of
cowardice. I cannot abandon the Dominican people
because that would be a denial of the ideals of
DUARTE, SANCHEZ and MELLA, {[ cannot turn my back
to American Democracy, because that would mean
-opening the doors to Communism, in order’ to deal
the death blow to our way of life.

"As General JUAN SANCHEZ RAMIREZ said in
the battle of Palo Hincado, when he defeated the
troops. of Emperor Napolen:

“'The death penalty to the soldier who turns
back; the death penalty to the drummer who sounds
retreat; and the death penalty to the officer who
orders it, even though it be I, myself.°

"I, Mr. President, will never order retreat.
My brave soldiers and officers, my beloved Dominican
people, my sacred fatherland, will always find me
honorably fighting in the front lines against the
traitors who try to deliver us to an ideology which
represents a system of slavery and brutality.

"I hope that the United States Government will
make no further mistakes and that it will understand
that sacrificing democratic military men is not the
best way to hold back the advance of Communism. [I
trust that the United States is able to break up that
network of infiltrators who are conspiring against
Liberty in their own land and in the very offices
which handle their international affairs.

“As I publicly criticize the action against
my person, it is not my intention to furnish weapons
for Communism to attack the United States. I wish
to state that I repudiate the action of these evil
North Americans who are causing a loss of prestige
to that great nation, and I trust that there will
soon be a proper rectification of the mistaken
policy which has been follewed in my country.

"Remember, Mr. President, that it will be
difficult for you to oppose the Communist con-
