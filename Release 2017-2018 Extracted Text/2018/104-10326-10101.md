FOLLOWING ARTICLE APPEARED IN THE

27 MARCH EDITION OF

"WASHINGTON TIMES:"

"THE KGB SPIES WHO CAME IN FOR THE GOLD

ON THE STREET OF TRUTH, ' RETIRED KGB

SECRET AGENTS CAME TO TELL ALL.

"WITH NO HINT OF SHAME, THE COLD WAR SPY MASTERS

SAID THEIR MEMOIRS CAN BE HAD FOR CASH--ON EVERYTHING

FROM<LEE HARVEY OSWALD>TO KIM PHILBY AND THE SPY RING

THAT STOLE THE SECRETS OF THE ATOM BOMB FROM AMERICA.

"'THE IDEA THAT ALL PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE IN ESPIONAGE

ARE VERY RICH IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE, ' SAID ANATOLY PRIVALOV,

VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSOCIATION

OF KGB VETERANS OF

FOREIGN ESPIONAGE, OR FIVA, AS THE RUSSIANS CALL IT.

"MR. PRIVALOV AND THREE COLLEAGUES FROM THE ELITE OF

KGB ESPIONAGE CAME NOT OUT OF THE COLD BUT OUT OF THE

RAIN WEDNESDAY TO THE OFFICES OF KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA ON

ULITSA PRAVDA (TRUTH STREET) .

"THEY TOLD REPORTS OF THEIR PLANS TO ENTER THE

CAPITALIST WORLD THAT THEY TRIED TO VERY HARD TO

UNDERMINE DURING THEIR CLOAK-AND- DAGGER

DAYS.

"FEAR OF POVERTY HAD SPURRED THE RETIRED SPIES IO

SIGN UP WITH THE HOLLYWOOD FIRM ENTERTAINMENT AND

COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS ASSOCIATION TO PEDDLE THEIR

INSIDE HISTORY OF THE COLD WAR FOR FILMS, MINISERIES AND

DOCUDRAMAS.

"'DUE TO THE PRESENT CONFUSION IN OUR COUNTRY,

OF THE VETERANS ARE IN A VERY DIFFICULT (FINANCIAL)

SITUATION, ' MR. PRIVALOV SAID.

SAID HIS

*

WITH<LEE HARVEY OSWALD>IN MEXICO CITY TWO MONTHS BEFORE

OSWALD SHOT< PRESIDENT KENNEDY.>

"THE OSWALD MEETINGS TOOK PLACE SEPT. 27-28, 1963,

ON THE INITIATIVE OF OSWALD, SAID MR. NECHIPERENKO, THEN

KGB STATION CHIEF IN MEXICO CITY.

"'HIS MOOD WAS BAD, ' SAID MR. NECHIPERENKO.

"BUT, HE TEASED, 'THE OSWALD HE MET IN MEXICO CITY

WAS THE SAME ONE WHO WAS IN DALLAS.

"ANOTHER NECHIPERENKO TIDBIT: TWO OTHER KGB MEN

WERE PRESENT AT THE INTERVIEW AND AN OPERATIVE IN MOSCOW

WAS KEPT ABREAST OF THE DISCUSSIONS.

"EXHIBITING FAMILIARITY WITH OLIVER STONE'S MOVIE

<' JFK,' >MR. NECHIPERENKO SAID HE WOULD AGREE WITH SOME OF

THE CONCLUSIONS OF JAMES GARRISON, ' BUT ONLY BASED ON THE

FORMER NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S BOOK, NOT ON ANY

EVIDENCE.

"IF HE HAD THE DOCUMENTS, MR. NECHIPERENKO SAID, HE

COULD GIVE A BETTER VERDICT.

OF COURSE, NO TALK OF SUCH

* AN-ASSASSINATION>TOOK PLACE IN MEXICO CITY AND THERE WAS

NO ENCOURAGEMENT OF SUCH A DEED, HE SAID.

"MR. NECHIPERENKO HAS BEEN TROTTED OUT BEFORE BY THE

KGB ALONG WITH YURI MODIN, THE HANDLER OF KIM PHILBY,

BRITISH MASTER SPY WHO WORKED FOR THE SOVIETS.

DIED IN MOSCOW IN 1988.

"THE NEW FACE SHOWN WEDNESDAY WAS ANATOLY YAZKOV,

CODE-NAMED 'YAKOVLEV' IN HIS WORLD

WAR II YEARS IN

AMERICA WHEN HE HELPED RUN THE SPY RING THAT GAVE JOSEF

STALIN THE ATOM BOMB.

IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

ESPIONAGE PENETRATIONS IN HISTORY.

"BUT MR. YAZKOV, BEYOND ADMITTING THAT HE WORKED OUT

OF THE RUSSIAN CONSULATE AT 7 E. 61ST ST. IN NEW YORK

CITY, ACROSS FROM THE HOTEL PIERRE,

RETICENT.

"ASKED IF JULIUS AND ETHEL ROSENBERG, WHO WERE

EXECUTED IN 1953 FOR PASSING ATOMIC SECRETS, WERE INDEED

GUILTY, MR. YAZKOV SAID HE PREFERRED 'NOT TO TALK ABOUT

PEOPLE WHO TOOK PART IN THIS OR MIGHT HAVE TAKEN PART IN

THIS.

"IT WAS NOT THE BEST ADVERTISEMENT FOR HIS

FORTHCOMING WORK.

"WHEN ASKED IF HE MISSED THE COLD WAR, MR. YAZKOV

REPLIED, 'THANK GOD THAT IT IS OVER.'

"UNCONTRITE, HE INSISTED HE WAS 'NOT SPYING AGAINST

AMERICA, BUT IN SUPPORT OF THE SOVIET UNION IN ORDER TO

BALANCE THE TWO POWERS.'

"ABOUT 5,000 FORMER KGB OPERATIVES ARE

MEMBERS OF

THE

ASSOCIATION.

"'WHEN A PERSON LEAVES HIS POST, HE IS LEFT ALL

ALONE, ' SAID MR. PRIVALOV,

ORDER THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT FEEL THEMSELVES ABANDONED, WE

DECIDED TO UNITE AND TO ORGANIZE A CLUB WHERE VETERANS

COULD COME TO RELAX, TO DRINK A BEER OR A WHISKEY, AS THE

ASSOCIATION OF THE CIA DOES.

"INSTEAD OF FEELING SORRY FOR THEMSELVES, THE FORMER

CLOAK-AND-DAGGER MEN WILL WORK ON A FILM ABOUT THE ATOM

BOMB SPY RING; A IV MINISERIES ABOUT U.S. NAVY EMPLOYEE

GLENN MICHAEL SOUTHER, A SOVIET SPY WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE

IN MOSCOW IN 1989; AND A DOCUMENTARY ON OSWALD'S BIZARRE

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE KGB.

WE HAVE NOTED THAT SOME SIMILAR

THREADS RUN THROUGH BOTH THIS ARTICLE AND THE LWORUS CASE

A. THE TIMING OF THE OFFER BY THE FIVA GROUP ON

WEDNESDAY, 25 MARCH,

FALLS DIRECTLY INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE

WINDOW BSTABLISHED BY LWOPUS (24-26 MARCH) .

AISO, IWOPUS

MANUSCRIPT-ACROSS THE

BORDER, HE WOULD RESORT TO A

RESERVE VARIANT BUT WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OTHER PARTIES,

I.E., HE WOULD APPROACH SOMEONE-ELSE.

IWOPUS SENT A SAMPLE OF HIS WORK TO US NOT FOR

PUBLICATION BUT FOR A CRITICAL READING.

HE STATED THAT IF A

PUBLISHING HOUSE SHOWED INTEREST IN HIS MANUSCRIPT,_ AGREEMENT.

BE REACHED REGARDING JOINT ACTIONS AND MUTUAL LEGAL

COMMITMENTS ALTHOUGH MONETARY- COMPENSATION-TS-IMPLIED,-

LWOPUS DOES NOT MENTION ANY SPECIFIC SUM, RATHER HE SUGGESTS

THAT HE IS WILLING TO ENTER INTO SOME SORT OF CONTRACTUAL

AGREEMENT.

THIS IS COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT THE FIVA GROUP

APPEARS TO BE ATTEMPTING.

THE FIVA GROUP STATES IN NO

UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT THEY NEED MONEY.

C. IN EACH CASE THERE APPEARS TO BE A LARGE VOLUME

IWOPUS STATED THAT UP TO NOW HE HAS PREPARED

SEVEN FOLDERS ON FOURTEEN COUNTRIES AND FORESEES WRITING

25 SMALI, BOOKS OR EPISODES ON DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

GROUP ALSO IMPLIES THAT A LARGE VOLUME OF MATERIAL EXISTS.

IWOPUS CLAIMS THAT HIS WRITINGS WERE BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTARY

SOURCES.

THE FIVA GROUP MAKES NO SUCH CLAIM, BUT IMPLIES THAT

THEIR MATERIAL IS FROM PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.

D. BASED UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF THE

MATERIAL AND THE TIME SPAN IT ENCOMPASSES, WE SUSPECT THE

LWOPUS MANUSCRIPT MIGHT BE A JOINT EFFORT.

IF IT IS NOT A

JOINT EFFORT, COLLECTION MUST HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG

TIME BY SOMEONE WITH EXCELLENT ACCESS TO ARCHIVAL MATERIAL.

THE FIVA GROUP IS A COMMON EFFORT OF AT LEAST FOUR (AND

PROBABLY MORE) RETIRED KGB OFFICERS.

LWOPUS NOTED THAT HE IS CONCERNED FOR HIS SAFETY

AND THAT OF HIS FAMILY.

HIS FAILURE TO SHOW AT THE EMBASSY IN

DURING THE WINDOW MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF HIS CONCERN.

STATED THAT HE HAD ALREADY ALERTED THE

EMBASSY,

BE ALERT FOR THE RETURN

IWOPUS BECAME AWARE THAT THE

IN SUCH CASE, ASSUMING THAT

JFSN IN HIS OFFICE, THAT THEY

tHE LOPUS MESSENGER.

_ EMPLOYEE HAD BEEN TOLD

HE MAY HAVE ELECTED NOT TO RETURN.

IS CONNECTED WITH THE FIVA

GROUP, THEIR OFFER TO THE HOLLYWOOD FIRM MAY BE AN ALTERNATE

PLAN.

IN EACH CASE, THE MATERIAL PRESENTED WOULD HAVE

AP US OF ENTER GONE REWATED SNIPPETS READING IN-PE OFFER

AGENTS VS THE OFFER TO THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY OF THE MORE

SPECTACULAR CASES THAT WOULD APPEAL TO A MASS AUDIENCE.

THE NAME OF

EVERY CASE, THE FORMER SOVIETS FREQUENTLY USED COVER NAMES

SIMILAR TO

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONFIRM EITHER

OF THESE ATTEMPTS, IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT-THE-MANUSERIPT HE-

PROVIDED TO US WAS A CARBON.

BASED ON THE QUALITY, WE BELIEVE

WE ARE CURRENTLY CHECKING THE FILES OF THE FOUR FIVA

OFFICERS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THEIR BACKGROUNDS MIGHT OFFER

THEM ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION THAT' LWOPUS PROVIDED.

ALSO PLAN TO COMPARE THE MATERIAL WE RECEIVED FROM LWOPUS TO

SEE IF THE FILES OF THESE FOUR OFFICERS INDICATE THAT THEY HAD'

CONTACTS SIMILAR TO ANY OF THOSE MENTIONED IN THE LWOPUS

MATERIAL. WE WILL ADVISE YOU OF THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH.
