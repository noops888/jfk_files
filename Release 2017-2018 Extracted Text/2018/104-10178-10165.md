17. Peter had inown Vasil IAZAROY as a child, but he had not seen him for
aix years until tho tim of the Trudovuk sffair, He knows that LAZAROV
was chalman of the Communist rout. urganization.4n Belashtica, NIKCLOV
thinks that LAZAROV nay have been a double agent, but if he had really
wanted to betray the croup he had axple epportunity to do so. In any
ease NIKON foals that [ACANOY did not avt in good faith because he
promised the Trudovaks a guide to tresc> while he actually intenied to

heard of Peter and Boris FELTEKOY, ani he considera them to be nationalists
even though ho hed aome migunderstandirgs with thex during the flight to
Greece. Anong the Trudovaks he likes Spas RAIKIN best.

Us. The poli thorittes tol leter

18. After being Ja¢$.alone at the Lavrion Camp for a considersble tine, Poter
and Ivan NIKOLOY applied for imigration to Brasil. In the baginaing they
were willing to stay in Greece and fight Commnism an Bulgaria. They
expreesed to RRISEY their willingness to go missicas into Bulgaria, but
FRISCH made no commitmenta. Since no action was taken, both left for
Brasil 17 November 1751.

19. Comment. Tue operational value of the brothers was not very high,
@pecially after the arrest of some renters of the underground arganizatton
in tho Plovdiy area. Noverthaless, they are willing and anle te try gone-
thing. In the future core ragfd action should be takon in unier to prevent
prospective agents from becoming discoursged and leaving.
