MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SURJECT: Meeting with AMLASH-1 in Paria,
$1 January to 3 February 1965

1, AMLASH-1 returned trom Rome to Paris on 31 Jan 1963
and was met for a very brief meeting the same night by ONTRICH
in order to arrange a meeting for the following day, The
following subjects were discussed at the two meetings on 1 and
2 February 1965:

@. The primary reason for again meeting AMLASH~2
ie planned return to Cuba was to brief hin on the

Orozco, ai ding to his we, went to Cuba to rescue
and three others: wh re hiding in the
, home of a woman named who lived at
T Hie a _|Havana.
Orozco's capture, if he has been captured, presents an
indirect threat to the security of AMLASH-1 and a more
direct threat to the security of AMTRUNK-10 Since Orozco
in Jan 1964 oxfiltrated througthe rat line established
by AMICE-14 (Miguelito), Upon his return to Cuba,
1 will check the above with AMTRUNK-10; and, if

still in hiding, If the letter to UNSNAFU-9 Mentions a
good and pleasant return trip, this will mean that Orozco
is not under the control of the security service. If the
letter talks abouth long, tiring trip, this will indicate
that Orozco has been arrested. AMLASH-1 was also requested
to send a report on the above and any complications which
have developed or may develop from Orozco's Ainfiltration.

Db. AMLASE-1 suggested that his nom de guerre "Charles,"
which we have been using for the past three years, be
changed to "Gerardo,"

the locomotives under their own power or are they towed,

although the scarcity and lack of a balanced diet do
cause some problems. The purification of water has been
@ problex which probably has been the cause of some of the
sickness in the country. oe

m. AMLASH-1 did not believe that Aragones had invited
him to fly back to Havana with him in order to get him
back because of any serious security matter. AMLASH-1

did state that Aragones was concerned that AMLASH-1 may not
return to Cuba. Since Aragones cleared AMLASH-1 for his :
trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH-1 does %
mot defect and returns to Cuba. AMLASH-1 feals Aragones
does not want any problems with Fidel in case AMLASH~1
decides to stay out,

p. Rank of Cuban officials under Fidel in terms of
their influence in making national policy, Reul is still
the heir apparent to Fidel. Next to Raul is Che Guevara,
After that, no other official, according to AHLASH-1, has
any great influence in the making of Cuban national policy.
President Dorticos’ relationghip with Fidel is gvod since
be is 2 herd and serious worker, has good administrative
ability and is able to work within the general outlina laid
down by Fidel, Raul Castro has some political influence |
and control in Oriente where he has placed his men in
positions of influence, but only Fidel personally has any
poBtical influence in the rest of Cuba, Even withis the
military Fidel selects and appoints high army officers.

Che Guevara is still strong in the economic field and

has not suffered a decline in his influence and authority
because of his eurlier policy of industrialization,

Guevara restricts himself to the econonmie field and plays

& very suall role in the political field. He is serious
and very hard worker, one of the few, according to AMLASH-1,
who has worked geven days a week without leave since the
revolution, Emilio Aragones holds an important posttion

as the organizational secretary of the PURS, He is the
official who was always at the office of the National
Directorate of the Party and has contact with all the
officials in the regime. He plays an important coordinating
role, Faure Chomon has been.accused of organizing former
13th of Harch Revolutionary Directorate people, but,
according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that
Chomon always gives jobs in the ministry he heads to DR
peopl Because of this Chomon today controls to 3 large
degree the Ministry of Transportation. Of all the ministries,
the DR's stronghold is in the Hinistry of Transportation,
Other DR people who continue to hold important positions

in the regime are Alberto Mora, Ambassador Carrillo and
Jose Naranjo. TMi ae

q. AMLASH-1 and AMWHIP-1 were unable to develop any
specifics, but from their conversations with Ambassador
Carrillo got the impression that Carrillo would prefer and
welcome a transfer from the Enbassy in Paris to the
Enbassy.in Madrid,

zt. According to Emilio Aragones, Anibal Escalante
ig being considered for a job outside Cuba. The job will
probably be in the commercial/economic field, but a
decision had not been made as of November 1964 as to
location.
