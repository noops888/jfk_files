JOSEPH BARBARA

The "Pittsburgh Press" of June 18, 1959, carried a front-

page.article concerning the death

of JOSEPH BARBARA of a

heart attack on June 17, 1959. It stated that BARBARA,

the

"sick friend" that sixty gangsters dropped in to see

at his Apalachin, New York, home on November 14, 195% s

lied of a heart ailment without revealing the secret

purpose of the underworld convention.

It noted that BARBARA,

53, had been in Wilson Memorial Hospital at Johnson City,

York, since May 29, 1959, with a heart attack. The

article

further stated

that the Sicilian-born BARBARA gave

up both his business and his home after State Police rounded

up his guests and that the home was sold for $130,000 during

May, 1959, to a developer who announced plans to convert it

into a tourist attraction.

The article noted that his lingering

illness had prevented his questioning by state and Federal

investigators who

have

indicted and Jailed a number of the

nation's biggest "name" criminals for allegedly lying or

* refusing to talk about his hilltop barbecue party.

C. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

Informant Coverage

advised that

"young JOHNNY" LA ROCCA, Younger brother of

JOHN LA ROCCA,

came in from Johnstown, Pa., during the last

week of May, 1959, and remained for at least five or six

days.

He stated that from his comments to him at the

apartment in which he is living on one of the nights LA ROCCA

was in Pittsburgh, he understood that one purpose of his

extended stay was

to confer with the elder LA ROCCA. He

advised that the appearance of both LA ROCCA and GABRIEL

"KELLY"

MANNARINO before the Senate Labor Rackets Committee

on June 11, 1959, caused quiet comment among his clientele

in the rackets, most of which concerned the status of the
