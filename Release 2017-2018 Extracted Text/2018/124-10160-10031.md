ReBulet 6/12/68, and BERlet 6/7/68.

Information furnished by FRANK RITTMAYER,

aka, has been made the subject of an LHM, 5 copies of which

are enclosed. RITTMAYER stated that he used the alias of

SHEPMAN in his letter since he had written the Bureau in

1965 requesting information concerning the FBI and was

afraid that the Bureau would therefore consider him too

juvenile to take his information seriously.

In view of the indefinite nature of RITTMAYER

information as well as the fact that it is hearsay several

times removed and that the persons who made the statements

would be extremely difficult to identify and locate, it is

recommended that no further action be taken in this

matter.

With regard to reBERlet

CIA, Bern, has informed/

that RICHARD CASE NAGELL is well known to the Bureau and is

considered to be mentally unbalanced.
