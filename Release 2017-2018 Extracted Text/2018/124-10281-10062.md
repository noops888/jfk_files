[In this latter case, GUILLERMO J. YGLESIAS,
representing himself as a CIA employee, formed a cadre
of individuals who believed they were employees of the
CIA working directly under his supervision, during the
period from the summer of 1973 through the spring of
1974. ANTONIO IGLESIAS was_jncluded in this group since
he had_asreputation locallyjof former associations with
CIA and¥€s an active anti-communist Cuban /<Purther it(u)
was wéll-known that prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion,
there were military units who trained in Nicaragua at
which time IGLESIAS became friendly with General SOMOZA
President of Nicaragua.

ANTONIO IGLESIAS is one of the main witnesses
to this impersonation and it is anticipated he will be
a witness in the subsequent trial of GUILLERMO J.
YGLESIAS. The reason for IGLESIAS' recent residence
in Nicaragua is not believed to be related with any
efforts to evade being a witness in this matter.

Current investigation of subject as requested
by the Bureau has included Miami Office indices check
with local sources and informants and related inquiry.
Subject's background and activities as set out herein,
indicate that he is well regarded in the Cuban community
as anti-CASTRO, anti-communist, and pro-United States.

He is not currently active or involved in Cuban terrorist
activities and there is no indication his activities would
pose any threat to the internal security of the United
States. Accordingly, no additional investigation is
warranted in this matter at this time.
