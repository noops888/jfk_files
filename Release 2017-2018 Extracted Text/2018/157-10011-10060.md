Mr. Kelley. Do you know who (QSEEis was?

Mr. Helms. He was a Cuban exile leader, is the best
definition to give 1 <r)

Mr. Kelley. I am told by a member of our staff who
reviewed these documents in their unsanitized forms that
a3) that L-l was AMLASH, and that the case
officers whom they have questioned about these documents --

[

Mr. Helms. Wasn 'tg jalso a member of the Cuban

Brigade?

Mr. Kelley He was very heavily involved in the Bay of

L-1 was AMLASH in the period '64-'65,

Pigs.
and the case officers who were -involved in. these documents
have testified, they say, that Desmond Fitzgerald knew all
about what they were doing, that he was informed that they
were trying to put AMLASH in touch with our teammate in order
to effect AMLASH's goal of assassinating Castro, and that
the case was a very big one, at least in their view of what
the DDP Directorate was doing at the time.

Mr. Helms. Who said Fitzgerald knew all of these things?

Mr. Kelley. The case officers that they. were working
for Fitzgerald.

Now my question is did you know what Fitzgerald was
doing? Did Fitzgerald report to you what he and his case

officers were doing with respect to amnasi,?

this case,.I think, two of them out in Europe some place,
handling an asset -- and just how often you put your finger
into the pie, if at all, other than getting yourself routinely
briefed by one of your trusted --

Mr. Helms. It would be the latter. Fitzgerald would be
the man who would report to me and tell me what was going on.
Get what authorizations he needed for me, bring me whatever
papers had to be signed in order to carry on his work. Obviously
minutes of 303° Committee meetings would come to me with
regard to participating, whether I did or didn't.

In other words, I would keep in the policy line there.
But the-actual operational: ‘details; -day: to (day; would ss) ~
be handled by Fitzgerald and his people in these various
stations, Miami -eIEIEI| and so forth. They would come into
him in Washington.

What telegrams going back and forth I would see. or would
not see, I would not have every single telegram there to
find out, but this was generally, he reported to me. I didn't
go down and talk to individual case officers about these.

Mr. Kirbow. One other question.

Mr. Helms. Except on -rare::dcécasions.

Mr. Kirbow. Sure.

After Desmond Fitzgerald returned from his trip to meet
with AMLASH, hoding himself forth, apparently properly to be

a representative of the United States government, do you recall

MEMORANDUM FOR: CIA Officer

SUBJECT: Last Meet with L-1 and Case Officer

1. M} according to his wife who spoke to him by telephone
10 December, hopes to return Tuesday, 15 December. L-1 will debrief
him as soon as he returns on the situation in Havana, and as agreed,
pass all information he collects through you. L-1 has no phone but

will.contact you through@UQOM You can call him at the residence

at telephone number.

ze returned from Madrid on 9 December with the information
from @REPrecarding the meeting with B-1.  L-1 may meet with B-1
later but is not prepared to meet with him until after he talks
with Qa and finds out the details of the arrangements. L-1 is
also concerned over his own security and that of the people inside
Cuba whom he would be committing once he ties in with B-1.

3. Our official line to take with regard to B-1 is that he
is operating from outside the United States, is doing what he can
for his country, and is highly thought of. Although we would like
to see B-1 and L-1 get toget » we do not want to be the brokers
in the union. All _we can do encourage ndirectly and permit
them to make their own: decision rYT? is in full agreement
with L-1 line of thinking regarding solution in Cuba and is the
reason he would like to join forces. B-1 does not know and we do

IE plan to tell him that we are in direct contact with L-1 nor

does L-1 know and we do not desire he know that we are in’ direct
contact with B-1.

4. L-1 was told and fully understands that the United States

of his plan. If he needs support, he realizes he will have to get
it elsewhere. FYI: This is where B-1 could fit in nicely in
giving any. support he would requests 00

\ Government cannot become involved to any degree in the "first step"

the Spanish security service may have planted in the apart
but was also caecking on his brothers, Before leaving
ordered three bottles of cider and four cans of beer. This
was delivered and everybody except _ +1 and Q -1 lett
the aprtment., They promised to call at 2000 hours to find out

. when they should come and pick them up.

2 2, They started the conversation discussing mutual
acquaintances and friands in Cuba, i. —1l Coes not think
much of the DRS boys, especially Salvat, who is in Hiami at
this time, but he does respect Alberto Muller who is in prison.
He stated that Muller is havingtroubles in the Isle of Pines
but he is Genonstrating his determination to resist any kind
of indoctrination which is forced upon hin, A -l hada
long list of government personalities which he had hidden in
his coat. When he extracted the list from its hiding place,

\. -l started to laugh, \. ~1 asked whether Oo -1
was also going to ask him about all these different people
because the Americans had also presented him with a long list‘
asking about the same people. He said the Americans always
ask him about these people and also about the new arms that
Fidel may have in Cuba.

3. \. -1 mentioned that the first thing that may \\
interest &-1 before they started to talk about any \\
personallties was that all the SAM sites were in Cuban hands | \
and not in Soviet hands, He also mentioned there were tyro
groups with whom he was in contact besides his own group of
the Directorio Revolucionario, one led by Cmdte. Efigenio

also from the 26th of July. The latter is opposed to the “|
regime, but a prerequisite to joining in the coup is the |

@ @linmination of Castro. The following officers are isembers of
this group: Cudtes, Sergio del Valle, Chief of Staff of the
Cuban Arny; Antonio Lusson y Catlie; Guillermo Garcia Frias,
Commander of the Western Army; and Victor Bordon Machado, Chief
of Artillery, Vestern Army. L~-1 was not too lauditory
concerning this group. He feels they want to reap thé fruit
after the big job has been performed. On theother hand,
regarding Ameijeiras, he claims that he has the courage and
determination to proceed with what has to be done under any
and all circumstances. ree

5. (> ~1 asked the following question of L -2;
If Fidel Castro should be eliminated, what officers would?
join a group which would oppose the Communist Party, Raul
Castro, Che Guevara and company. i—{ mentioned Sergio del
Valle. L-t claims that he has already talked to del Valle
but the condition placed by him is the death of Fidel Castro
or he is unwilling to participate in any kind of coup.
According to ._ --| he has already spoken with cel Valle,
Lugson, Cuillermo Garcia Frias, and Victor Pordon Machado. All
of these people are in the sama position as del Valle; they are
not willing to participate in anything until Fidel Castro is
eliminated. In B-\ opinion, the following would also
join the anti-Communist forces once Fidel Castre is sliminated:
Juan Almeida Bosque, Celarming Castilla Sas and Pedro Miret.
@ Another man who may also join them is "31 Gallego" Yernandez,
but he has no troops with him, The troops are very much
opposed to him because he was a member of Batista's old army.
He was then made a comandante in the new rebel arny. t=
feels that Cmdte. Manuel Cespedes Fernandez, the deputy commander
of the Hastern Army An Oriente, will probably join an anti-
Communist group. “Let is not certain of Cespedes but does
know hig brother is anti-Communist. L-t has not yet
spoxen with or talxed with Cadte. Cscar Fernandez Mel who is
the deputy commander in the Western Army, L-\ is rela-
tively sure fernandez will join them since Fernandez is against
Castro since Fidel is living with Fernandez's wife, L-1
is also certain that the members of the old army and the old
navy will also join them although he has not had direct contact
with these people. He is sure of this because Fidel at every
opportunity warns Ramiro Valdes to check these people out and
keep a careful wateh on them, This group consists of Cmdte. Juan
Ignayra Uatarran, Chief of the Eastern Naval District in Panes,
whoy L-1 Claims is a homosexual; Capt. Juan Valdez Reyes,
member of PURS; Capt, Juan Vxlez Carrion, Naval Base Commander,

is Cadte. Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, the ‘iinister cf Public
Health, Machado and Cadte, Raul Vallejo Crtiz are in the
midst of a dispute since Vallejo is desirous of getting Hachado's
ministry. L-t gave @-i the details and the exact

specifically every Sunday at Varadero, Ce | will take
maps with him the next time he travels to Surope to see

Vaure Chomon Mediavilla, Minister of Transport, is 100 percent
Communist. (FNU) Garcia is also very close to Chomon and they
are both completely enchanted with Marxism and Marxist theories,

7. After discussing the different personalities, _..@-|
and L-\ started talking about other matters. L-1
” informed ®-\ l that the first Cuban exile leader with whoa
8) he had talked was bee. L-t decided to make this
3 contact because he felt it necessary to develoo a concrete
plan they could proceed to work on, \-\ claims he was
convinced that B-\ actually has something because of
the way Fidel talks against him and is opposed to him even
in private conversations, L—-1 Claims that the commando
raids raise the morale and spirit of resistance of the people
in Cuba. L-\ had one piece of advice for @-t , that
is, &-| must concentrate his commando attacks on two
targets. He was very insistent to forget military targets but |
to concentrate on economic targets, specidically sugar and FOL.’
Ne said these two items are in short supply and it infuriates.
Fidel every time he looses one drop of oil or one pound of sugar.
The other piece of advice L-t had for A=) was that
the frequency of the attacks should be stepped up. He felt
there was too much time between operations. In order to heat
up the target, L-\ also suggested that one month before
the attempt on Fidel Castro as many targets as possible should X
be hit in order to prepare the public and raise the morale and
resistance spirit of the people, L.-| told a-| that
the militiamen or the army will do nothing ance Fidel is dead.
They will sit back and wait to see what the Cuban public will do.
If the Cuban public takes to the street, they will do nothing to

L=-t was against taking the risks of operating a radio \

in Cuba. {_—| said, "The other things the Americans want
te to do is to organize a coup, to organize a group of
officers, battalions and regiments in order to carry out a
coup against Fidel. But what the Americans fail to realize
is that they are not faced with another regular Latin American
government in Cuba. _S0 long as Fidel Castro is around, this
is impossible, When people rrom Washington come to talk With

mentalaty, recognizing the sitation in Cuba." Ho said Ww!

now whether /v is even from Washington since he has asked
him for a silencer and he won't even give; him a silencer.

9. L-1 claims the only thing that he is capable
of doing is trying to get rid of Fidel Castro. He is able ta
@ either to shoot him with a silencer or place a bomb in some |

place where Fidel will be, de might use, for example, a small :
bomb that he can carry and place, or with his group attack, 41
the residence where Fidel lives when he goes to Varadero, mat
These are the only things he can do, After that he has to |
pray and hope he isn't caught. LHe also stated he does not
want to become a martyr ahd does not want to exchange his
life for Difel’s. He conZirms he is not a hero, he wants to \
live and see what bappens after Fidel. He says he is not
opposed to risking his life providing he has some assurance
or some possibility of getting out and also of assuring
himself? that he will accomplish hig mission. He claims that
once he climinates Fidel, the comandantes that he has men-
tioned before will join him. At this particular time, it
is necessary for a-\ to appear on the scene because
this will convince everybody that the Americans are also
backing the coup, He niso claims that if be is unsuccessful
in his attempt against Fidel, it is tho same comandantes who
will slit his throat in order to keep him from talking.
L-t claims this is the reason he needs Bel. If the

attempt fails, he will have a placa to so. If it is successful,

pepe also have G~\ t to guarantee U. S. support.

10. \_-\. in discussing the political set up after
Fidel, claims he 1s not opposed to is—\ being president
@ of the junta, provided there is an equal number of represen+
tatives on the junta from the internal group. Those from

‘Cuba. Yor example, if there are six people on the junta. three
vould be from (eierese tee and Ameijeiras's groups and i-1
plus two of his group from inside Cuba.

1. L-| asked that the other members of the junta
pe revolutionary members who are presently in jail on the Isle
of Pines, that they not be old Katistianos or from the exile
community. {—! claims it has to be the former revolu-
tionaries who have now served time on the Isle of Pines in
order to help cleanse the ones who have collaborated with the

rogime all this time. L-i feels they will need the
Anfluence the boys in prison can bring to bear on the masses,
fhe other point that al insisted upon was that in the

first three months after a coup the Cuban exiles not be per- H
mitted to return to Cuba. The only ones who would be permitted
to return, in a non-political and strictly technical fashion, {
would be the doctors and the engineers, and only to work, not {
to engage in politics,

12. L-\l asked, "First, what do I need?” The first
- thing he claims he needs is a means of escape. tL-{ said
he needed escape routes provided by Q-t _ not those
& belonging to the Americans, “If you fail me, then L-2
will kill you and he is unable to kill the Americans.”
"  B =| is going to provide L-t with escape routes and ——

memorize these points and escape routes. He will not take
anything back in writing.

13. U-l| also asked that B-\ do everything
possible to organize one of the vestern provinces, either
Pinar del Rio or Havana, where they could have a fall back

position or where, once Fidel is eliminated, \L-\ can go
in order to take refuge during the period of chaos which may °‘
follow.

14, Next, B-l is to provide L_-\ either a
silencer for a FAL or a rifle with a silencer, S-\ told
L-{ he did not know since he was not a technician, if

it is possible to make a silencer for the FAL. L-\

stated that the Americans also told him it was technically
impossible because it would reduce the effective range of the
FAL, but he wasn't sure this was the case. If a -| can
give L-\ a silencer, he will personally take the silencer

15, The other thing t-| requested of Aa-y\
was a bomb inside a suitcase, a cake, a lamp or any concealed
pomb that he could place at Fidel’s side without being stopped
pad gearched before setting there. He said, "Lon't send ne
nny radios, don't expect me to operate any radios inside Cuba."

16, G -\ offered 1 contacts inside Cuba,

L-l| thought about it and then stated he would accept these
contacts, but he would establish the contact after having 7
checked them out; he did not want the contacts coming to hin
or knowing who he was. B-\ agreed and stated this was
perfectly satisfactory.

17. L-\ also would like to know the exact location
of the cache before he returns so he can momorize this infor-
mation, After the cache is in place, (sesaeed b asked el
to write him a letter in French mailed in Paris, purporting
to be from a Frenca girl friend whom he had wet there, talking
about their love affairs in Paris. He will know when he
receives this letter the cache is in place and he will go
pick it up. L-| requested several letters be written to
him in case one of the letters should get lost, Another thing
he requested was that the cache be placed in a location where
he could go with rolative ease without causing suspicion,

®--\ was unable to remember but L-{ .did mention
that the Asericans had either given him a cache or had pro-
mised him a cache. However, it was placed in such a location
that it was impossible for him to go recover it.

13, L-l also requested that once Fidel was eliminated
and the new government formed, they would have the recognition
of at least five Latin American governments. B- had
already offered this and L—| approved of it.

19. L-1 also requested that after every commando
attack the propaganda reaching Cuba would state that as
attack was made possible because of the intelligence received
from the chief of the underground inside Cuba. Thanks to .

“P° who is the leader of the underground this attack was
“made possible. L—{ . hopes that after Fidel Castro is

20, L-t also requested that Bel be in Cuba
one week before the clinination of Fidel. G-\ ogreed
to this provided no one, including L- | Know where he
@ was hiding. At the time the elimination of Fidel takes place,
L-} insists that &-( must be in Cuba. t-tlo

fact that ne has been with Fidel and the present regime for
such a long time and no one realizes that, althouzh he has been
in contact with the Americans, he is unable to publicize the 7
fact that he has been working against Fidel for over three
years, The second complex, and a very personal fear, is the
fact that he may be_left hanging by himself. He lacks
confidence in every body outside Cuba. The other considera
tion that L-\ raised with 6-\ ‘was, uponhis return
to Paris, ne would type an original and one copy of the agree-
ments, When they meet the next time, both oie] and

L-l would sign both copies, -l would keep one

rent, his confidant could publish the agreement, B-\

to his part of the agreement. comet considers the request

ridiculous since no purpose can possibly be served by publishing

such a document, but realizes this is also a part of L-i's
