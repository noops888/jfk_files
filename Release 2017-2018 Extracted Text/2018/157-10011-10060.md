Mr. Kelley. Do you know who Aprile was?

Mr. Helms. He was a Cuban exile leader, is the best

definition to give to

Mr. Kelley. I am told by a member of our staff who

reviewed these documents in their unsanitized forms that

an

that I-1 was AMLASH, and that the case

officers whom they have questioned about these documents --

ME. Helms. Wasn't AlrEjalso a member of the Cuban

Brigade?

B -1

Pigs.

(B-1 was

Mr. Kelley. He was very heavily involved in the Bay of

ARTIME% I-1 was AMIASH in the period '64-'65,

and the case officers who were invölved in these documents

have testified, they say, that Desmond Fitzgerald knew all

about what they were doing, that he was informed that they

were trying to put AMLASH in touch with our teammate in order

to effect AMLASH's goal of assassinating Castro, and that

the case was a very big one, at least in their view of what

the DDP Directorate was doing at the time.

Mr. Helms. Who said Fitzgerald knew all of these things?

Mr. Kelley. The case officers that they were working

for Fitzgerald.

Now my question is did you know what Fitzgerald was

doing? Did Fitzgerald report to you what he and his case

officers were doing with respect to AMLASH?

this case,: I think, two of them out in Europe some place,

handling an asset -- and just how often you put your finger

into the pie, if at all, other than getting yourself routinely

briefed by one of your trusted -

Mr. Helms. It would be the latter. Fitzgerald would be

the man who would report to me and tell me what was going on.

Get what authorizations he needed for me, bring me whatever

papers had to be signed in order to carry on his work. Obviously

minutes of 303 Committee meetings would come to me with

regard to participating, whether I did or didn't.

In other words, I would keep in the policy line there.

But the actual

operational details, day to day, would"

be handled by Fitzgerald and his people in these various

stations, Miami,

and so forth. They would come into

him in Washington.

What telegrams going back and forth I would see or would

not see, I would not have every single telegram there to

find out, but this was generally, he reported to me. I didn't

go down and talk to individual case officers about these.

Mr. Kirbow. One other question.

Mr. Helms. Except on rare occasions.

Mr. Kirbow. Sure.

After Desmond Fitzgerald returned from his trip to meet

with AMLASH, hoding himself forth, apparently properly to be

a representative of the United States government, do you recall

also concerned over his own security and that of the people inside

Cuba whom he would

is operating from outside the United States, is doing what he can

for his country, and is highly thought of.

Although le would like

to see B-l and

L-l get together, le do not want to be the brokers

reason he would like to join forces.

B-1 does not know and we do

not plan to tell him that we are in direct contact with L-l nor

does

L-1 know and we do not desire he know that we are in' direct

contact with B-1.

4. L-l was told and fully understands that the United States

Government cannot become involved to any degree in the

"first step"

of his plan. If he needs support, he realizes he will have to get

it elsewhere. FYI: This is where B-1 could fit in nicely in

giving any support he would request.
