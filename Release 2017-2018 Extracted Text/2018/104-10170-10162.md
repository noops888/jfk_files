appeared'on Dutch TV (Dutch Television Foundation, NTS) during

2. The following were Garrison's charges:

a. Kennedy was murdered because he favored &
detente detrimental to the interests of the "military-
industrial complex".

b. Kénnedy was the victim of a CLA plot. CIA
has made common cause with the military-industrial
establishment because of a vested interest in maintaining
the cold war.

¢; CIA is committed to the land war in Asia,
whereas’one of President Kennedy's last orders directed

! a reduction of troops there.

d. AUS. president who brings the U.S. to the
brink-of peace will’suffer Kennedy's fate.

€. Asked'why the progtam had been designed for
a European audience, Garrison said that the growing
influence of CIA on U.S. media had made it impossible for
him to be heard in his own country,

3, Reference A says Garrison, calm and composed, was

sufficiently credible to clicit rather favorable reviews from generally

well informed Dutch newspapers. “Several Dutch viewers also
commented on the credibility /“of 7 his person and presentation.
Likely that the NTS will try to sell this program to other European
stations." f

4. Reierence B says that the Dutch press was generally favorable
and that many comments noted he seemed logical an

‘ol of his
facts. The majority opinion among Embassy, USIS,§and CLA}personnel
at The Hague is that-he seem dible to a large proportion of the
Dutch viewers. (SYMPATHIZER 17\tects that the program created an
all-time low in the UTS. image in the Netherlands. Dutch TV alluded
to a third part of the interview, still to come.
