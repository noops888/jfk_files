Dear Miriam:

Recently during a conversation with Bob Skwirot of the ARRB

staff, I mentioned the 8 documents from NARA's Warren

Commission collection that I had sent to CIA for rereview in

Bob said that CIA had

already rereviewed various versions of Slawson's report and he

subsequently sent me the attached sheets that show final action

and the CIA'S RIF numbers.

However, he only sent me the final

text of the 55-page version.

At any rate, I was wondering if

there is anything more than CIA might supply in response to the

october 1995 request. •

10. Memorandum From the Central Intelligence Agency Project

Officer for Operation Mongoose (Harvey) to the Chief of

Operations, Operation Mongoose (Lansdale)

Washington, October 8, 1962.

SUBJECT

Sabotage of Cuban-Owned Skip

1. tis requested that you present the following proposalto the Spe-

cial Group (Augmented) for policy approval.

2. Policy approval is requested to permit the sabotage of Cuban-

owned vessels wherever and whenever secure access to them can be

attained, normally this will be in non-Bloc ports. Attacks against the

Cuban-öwned ships must be considered essentially as attacks against

targets of opportunity in the sense that in most cases there will be little

advance information prior to the arrival of the ship in a non-Bloc port

, and the duration of the port call will be limited.

3.. The following specific types of action are contemplated:

(13 paragraphs (40 lines of source text) not declassified]

7. Later we will submit requests for policy approval of actions

against other ships supplying Cuba.

forwarded to State on 5 July 1994; the 5 July 1994 determina-

tions were reaffirmed (sustained) in a 6 November 1995 letter to

CU 348 was forwarded to State sanitized on 5 July 1994

with those determinations reaffirmed on 6 November 1995.

2. Volume XI has already been published so any

decisions made with respect to the JFK review

will not

influence the FRUS release.

Per conversations with Susan Weetman on 16 May

1997, Volume X is scheduled to be published in June 1997;

release decisions concerning the FRUS Vol. X documents

are firm and cannot be changed.

Therefore, any JFK review

of these documents will not influence the FRUS release.

2000

I have drafted a letter to Nina Noring returning the stack of documents she forwarded to us at the end of April. Chuck Briggs

and DO did the review. I have affixed the stamps and have the documents-on my desk-ready to go except for the one you are

withholding.

You may find the draft in "G" drive under HRG/Noring 8.

Your comments are welcome. I thought you might wish to add a paragraph about sending someone down to her place and also

give ourselves a pat on the back for our prompt review of 375 pages (30 days)!!!!

See you Monday.
