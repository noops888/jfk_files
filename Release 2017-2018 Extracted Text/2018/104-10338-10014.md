SUBJECT: Referrals Under the JFK Assassinations Records
Collection Act of 1992

Dear John, ,

As I mentioned over the telephone, we have uncovered one
more document requiring CIA review which I am enclosing.
Hopefully this will be the last one.

I am also returning to you CIA's referral under the Act to
HDR of August 23, which John Glennon has reviewed. As you can
see by his note, he completed it several days ago, and I forgot
to pass it on.to you when you were over the other day. John
Glennon has indicated one document for postponement. Although
I am returning it to you with the rest at this point, I have
passed a copy of it on to the reviewers in Diplomatic Security,
who are coordinating a response with CA. I will call you when
I get an answer from them. If they decide to release it, we
would then have to obtain a concurrence from FBI.

‘Thank you again for your prompt action in reviewing our
request. I will be getting back to you on the DS answer after
I return on October 7.

Sincerely,

Nina J. Noring,

Dear John,

I have found one more document that requires CIA review,
the attached memorandum from the Deputy Director for Plans to
the Director of INR, September 2, 1966 (State ID No. 17-228).
The document was reviewed by the Department's Mandatory Review
staff who indicated postponement of release under 1C of Section
6 of the JFK Act. Mandatory review also indicated that the
document should be reviewed by CIA.

Please let me know CIA's. decision on the status of this
document. If there has been prior release or if CIA now has no

objection to its release, I will convey this information to our
Mandatory Review staff.

Sincerely,

Dear Nina;

This is a response to your letters of 30 September and 27 October
1993 and 31 January and 25 February 1994, enclosing material for CIA
review under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992. This collection comprises seven documents (plus four duplicates),
with a total of 40 pages. In all but two of the documents, CIA is
asking for postponements of some passages under the terms of §§ (1) (A),
(1) (B), (1) (C), and (4) of Section 6 of the Act. These passages are
marked in yellow highlighting. For those passages marked off by red or
black ink brackets, but without yellow highlighting, CIA has determined
that said passages may be released under the terms of the Act.

I apologize personally for the inordinate delay in getting these
documents back to you.

Sincerely,

Dear Miriam:

Recently during a conversation with Bob Skwirot of the ARRB
staff, I mentioned the 8 documents from NARA’s Warren
Commission collection that I had sent to CIA for rereview in
October 1995 (memorandum attached). Bob said that CIA had
already rereviewed various versions of Slawson’s report and he
subsequently sent me the attached sheets that show final action
and the CIA’s RIF numbers. However, he only sent me the final
text of the 55-page version. At any rate, I was wondering if
there is anything more than CIA might supply in response to the
October 1995 request. -

CIA HES!

Dear Miriam,

I am enclosing 42 documents relating to U.S. relations with
Cuba for CIA review that come from the files of the former
Coordinator for Cuban Affairs (Lot 66D501). The Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB) has determined that this lot file
is covered by the 1992 legislation and should be reviewéd
according to its precepts. CIA previously reviewed 7 of, these
documents (11~22A; 11-26; 11-27; 11-38; 11-48; 11-49; 11-50)
for Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961-1963, Vols. X
and XI, Cuba and released them in part. We have marked the
excisions previously made by CIA on each document. State has
no objection to the release of these documents in full except
for the excisions indicated in documents 11-26 and 11-27.

The remaining 35 documents are numbered: 11-1; 11-3; 11-5;
11-6; 11-8; 11-9; 11-10A; 11-11; 11-11A; 1 2; 11-12A; 11-13;
11-16; 11-19; 11-22B; 11-22C; 11-23; 11-23A; 11-23B; 11-24;
11-28; 11-33; 11-37; 11-55; 11-57; 11-59; 11-61; 11-62; 11-64;
11-65; 11-69; 11-71; 11-72; 11-73; 11-74. Department of State
excisions are indicated in documents 11-11; 11=11A; ‘11-12A;
11-13; 11-22B; and 11-55.

These documents, which we have downgraded to Secret, were
taken from the Top Secret portion of the lot file. The week
after next I will be sending you an additional group of
documents from the Secret portion of this lot file for review
under the Act. I will be away from work the week of April 21
but return to my regular Tuesday to Thursday schedule the week
of April 28. My phone number remains 202-647-8799.

1. State Department forwarded a letter w/attachments
dated 18 April 1997 (copy attached) indicating that seven of
the enclosed documents forwarded for JFK review were also
the subject of previous Agency reviews for the FRUS volumes
on Cuba. The document numbers listed in the letter were
numbered for the JFK review. I located the first document
as already sanitized and published in Vol. XI. I phoned
Nina Noring of State to see if she could give me the
corresponding FRUS numbers which are listed below:

concerning our FRUS review: CU 329 was forwarded to State
sanitized on 20 July 1992; additional information released and
forwarded to State on 5 July 1994; the 5 July 1994 determina-
tions were reaffirmed (sustained) in a 6 November 1995 letter to
State. CU 348 was forwarded to State sanitized on 5 July 1994
with those determinations reaffirmed on 6 November 1995.


13-00000

2. Volume XI has already been published so any
decisions made with respect to the JFK review will not
influence the FRUS release.

3. Per conversations with Susan Weetman on 16 May
1997, Volume X is scheduled to be published in June 1997;
all release decisions concerning the FRUS Vol. X documents
are firm and cannot be changed. Therefore, any JFK review
of these documents will not influence the FRUS release.
