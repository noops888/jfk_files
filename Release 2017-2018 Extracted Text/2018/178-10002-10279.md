Most of my operations were run out of Europe.

Q Run out of --

A Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones
were run out of Europe.
Q Well, in the course of your activities with respect

to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the

operations of the Miami base?

A Yes.

Q And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?

A Yes, sir.

Q During the nine years you were with ppo's Cuban
operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami
Station?

A : I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he
was followed by -- I can’t think of his name. I should know

it..Well, I will come back to that.
Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.
Q What years was he Chief?

‘Baul was there about a year and a half. He

A I think
left in 1969 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's
say Hende was there from 1966 to 1968.
He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

you were assigned for the 9-year period?

Q Do you know whether or not they consider him an

established contact?

A No manner.

Q Do they nave any -- do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?
A I can't speak to that but the records that we have

don't reflect.anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hoid

the file.

Q Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?
A A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Q Personnel or personality file?
AR Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.
9 Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?
A Well, Iwill say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. ‘They have to know each other from their days

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel kept
saying that he had such a soor crop and this type of thing and

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because

some of cur own island assets told us they were out there cutting

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,

this type of thing. So subsequentiy, we found out that he was
i
lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any |

place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he

could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers in

New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar tcok a

against Cuba by the CIA?

Maritime operations.

had people detailed into the Agency.

outside the United States?

but I don't think that -- I think all the training was done
domestically.
Q Now, what kinds of operations are includéd within

this category of maritime operations?

A Well, the infiltration operations, infiltrating
agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage

raids. That is about the extent of it.

shortly after the Bay of. Pigs?

at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,
1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December

1968, something like that.

Q Why was the program terminated?
A First of all, it was too expensive. It wasn't provid-—
ing enough intelligence and it simply wasn't -- economically,

Q You say the agents were getting wrapped up.

the Forty Committee.

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because
the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were

they may be running three or four a month. No more than that.

because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type

up. to three -to 500 foot mother ship. We had Boston whalers,
rubber boats. We-had a number of craft in, say, the 27 to

they had: the fastest-engines in them. They could outrun any~-

Q Did any of these companies actually engage in any -)

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the
drydock or wherever it was, they..had ta remove the sugar and

\ put it in the. warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between ~~ there was

|| a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it
acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn’t harm the sugar or the
individual, and some of this was done. And then when it

leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar
firm buy it back from the Soviets. ' photocopy from

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-
whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability
to properly staff the thing?

A Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot
of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section
of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is

known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

and a lot of our Station officers

from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a

relationship there that had gone over a period of years

between the Agency and the Bureau.
MR.MANFREDI: We will reconvene at 1:00 o'clock.

the deposition was recessed, to reconvene at 1:00 p.m., this

Q Were these veople on whom name traces were requested
all foreign nationals?

A All foreign nationals.

2 ‘tias there any check made to determine whether
any of them were American citizens?

A we levied on the Secret Service as a requirement
that they have identified these ceople by nationality before
we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time
they did submit a iist, a rather long list of American citizens
which we promptly sent back to them and told them we could
not trace.

2 And this practice was followed both in 1968 and

A that is right.

And where were these names traced?

©

A They were traced back here and also in Miami. The
Miami Station did their name check and we did our name check

here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had

more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

Qo But the names were traced through Agency files?

A Well, it is a matter of record in the AMOT history
that this indeed did take slace. ‘low, what I have been trying
to determine is whether the On-Site Case Officer authorized

this,which I fully doubt.

2 Who was the On-Site Case Officer?.

A At that time it was 4 llow by the name of Tony
Sforza.

9 Is he sti

A Yes, he is down in Miami, But I just do not know
whether this was a unilateral action on the part of the
AMOTS against the countries that were then trading with
Cuba, notably Spain and Great ‘Britain and France.

2 Other than this incident which we -- strike that.

What kind of an investigation nave you conducted?

A i Rave taiked to people, which is really all you
can do. There is no other way you can do it.

q You have been unable to determine who, if anyone,

authorized this activity? Have you been able to identify

any of the persons who participated in the picketing?

A Mo.

2 with what frequency did this activity occur?

A I don't have any idea. I only know of one instance.
2 This was in New York City?

New York City and ami.
