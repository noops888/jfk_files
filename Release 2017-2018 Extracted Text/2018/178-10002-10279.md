your employment with the Agency?

2

A

When I first came in I was in the Intelligence

5

Directorate for approximately ten years and I was put on special

detail, special indefinite detail, in the Deputy Director, Plans,

5

which is now the Directorate of Operations.

6

What year were you put on that detail?

7

A

I guess it was 1964, January, I believe.

8

And what did that detail involve?

9

A

Cuban operations, economic warfare.

10

And how long were you on that detail?

11

I was in the Cuban operations for nine years.

12 |

Between 1964 and 1973?

13

A

(Nods in affirmative.)

14 l|

2

And in 1973 did you assume your current position?

15 |

A

Yes, January.

Now, while you were on special detail -- to the DOD?

17

A

Yes.

18

2

Were you stationed in Washington?

:

19

Yes.

20

And did you commute with some frequency to Miami?

21

Yes.

22

Were your activities in Miami in any way connected

23

with the operations of the Miami Station?

24

In some way. My responsibilities were worldwide.

• 25

Most of my operations were run out of Europe.

Run out of --

A

Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones

were run out of Europe.

Well, in the course of your activities with respect

to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the

operations of the Miami base?

Yes.

And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?

A

Yes, sir.

During the nine years you were with DDO's. Cuban

operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami

Station?

I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. I should know

it.. Well, I will come back to that.

Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.

What years was he Chief?

I think paul was there about a year and a half.

He

left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Henze was there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterline.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

Now, what was the formal title of the group to which

Special Activities Staff. It was headed by Desmond Fitzgerald.

And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations

Group.

Now, was this a special group within the DDO of was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

A

No.

Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing

called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

that -- when Harvey left, he went to chief of station,

and Fitzgerald took over, it became Special Activities Staff.

It vasn't attached to anything except - it reported to the

Deputy Director, Plans.

And that was Mr. Karamessines?

Yes.

Well, it was Helms at that time back when it

was first created. Heims was DDP at that time.

Q

And Task Force W was created immediately after the

Bay of Pigs?

A

Well, not immediately. I think sometime around --

in the Bay of Pigs was in April. 'I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

And that subsequently became the Special Activities

Staff?

Special Activities Staff and consequently became the

Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went

back into the Western Hemisphere Division.

And what was the date of that reorganization?

well, let's see. I would say that was probably around

1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.i., and then

later DDP.

Now, Mr.Harvey -- do you recall what position Mr.

Yes. He was Chiet of Station,

And is he still with the Agency?

Oh, no. He retired a long time ago.

well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force i was

established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban

operations?

A

Yes.

Or was that shared with the Miami base, Miami

Station?

No. The Miami Station was under Task Force W.

All right.

Would that also be true of the Special

Activities Staff, the Cuban Operations Group?

A

Right.

I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-

At the Station? Let's see.

attempts. I know there was discussion.

"Attempts" is too

strong a word.

any such discussions?

I was on IDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgerald

it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on

with a member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as

met with him again

I recall, as the personal representa-

I provided all those files. There are 19 volumes that

we gave to your people. But I don't know who was reviewing

Yes. He is. He is doing it himself:

No. Mr. Sanchez was in the Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

instructions with respect to this activity from another

component of the Government?

A

well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether

they received instructions. I have to assume, and I am pretty

positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.

MR. MANFREDI: • On the record.

BY MR. MANFREDI :

Q

MI. Sturbitts, are you familiar with a gentleman by

the name of Frank Sturgis?

A

Indeed.

Is your familiarity based on what you have read in

in an attempt to determine whether Mr. Sturgis ever had any

12

connection with the Agency?

the press?

8

A

No. It is what is contained in the files.

Have you caused a search to be made of CIA files,

•15

particularly the files of the Western Hemisphere Division,

13

I have.

1÷

What were the results of that search?

==

Absolutely no connection, never has been.

16

When we talk about connection, are we talking about

I?. an employment relationship?

16

A

That is what I am speaking of.

19

Was Mr.Sturgis ever an independent contractor of

Agency?

A

Not to my knowledge.

Do you know whether or not Mi. Sturgis ever partici-

pated in any type of paramilitary or other operation against

Cuba?

A

On his own behalf he did, not on behalf of this

Agency.

2

How did you learn of those operations?

A

Through the newspaper. And through FBI reports.

Now, are these recent FBI reports?

A

Oh, no. These go back -- I know at one time, the

thing that comes to mind, I think he made a leaflet drop

over Cuba and this was subsequently reported in the press and

by the Bureau office in Miami.

Do you know who financed his activities?

A

I have no idea.

Is it possible that Mr. Sturgis' activities were

indirectly financed by the Agency through -

I don't see how. Frank Sturgis is a soldier of.

fortune; has been. He has constantly tried to associate himself

with the Agency. When I went through his file they wanted me

to classify the file and the way I classified it was "don't

destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."

called for them the other day after the article in the paper,

I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and

they returned them Monday afternoon.

Do you know who examined those files?

A

No, I don't.

You indicated a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD office in Miami with some frequency, is that correct?

A

well, not great

Erequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information.

Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

A

Recently it has been.

Has Mr. Sturgis been encouraged by the DCD office

in Miami?

A

Mr. Sturgis has been told by the DCD office in Miami

to take his information to the Drug Enforcement Agency or the

Do you know whether

No manner.

Do they have any - do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A

I can't speak to

that but the records that we have

don't reflect. anything

like

that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

Personnel or personality file?

Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.

Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

A

Well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

No. As I recall, we employed Martinez around 1961,

and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids, hit and run,

sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

do it on any of our boats, planes, or - anything that belongs :

to the Agency.

When Martinez would run such an operation or captain

a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

together his own crew?

No. He had

an assigned crew and every boat had a

Case Officer operating either out of the -- probably out of

the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did have

some people in the Key west base. But he, Martinez, would receive

his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.

So it is likely that he could have brought Sturgis

along on any of these operations?

Absolutely unlikely. Oh, the guy whose name I was

trying to think of, Chief of Station, John Dimmer.

And that would be.for a period of time between

Shackley and Henze?

A

Yes.

Something like that.

Well, there was - it was an across-the-board

intelligence operation consisting of collection of foreign

positive intelligence,

counterintelligence, paramilitary

activities, covert action, economic activities. That is about

the breadth of the thing.

Now, these were all conducted through the DDO?

You spoke about paramilitary operations and covert

action. How do you distinguish between those two categories

of activities?

Well, actually one can fall into the other. The

paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those days

we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was

media placement. We had a number of operations at - legal-

type operations, harassment operations. For instance, Fidel

seized a great many art treasures and in particular he had a

Napoleonic collection which was supposed to be the finest in

the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings

that were immensely valuable that he tried to have auctioned

in London and the London auctioneer would not accept them

because he obviously didn't have clear title to them. He was

-- they were stolen, in the eyes of the auctioneer. He was

forced to auction them in Toronto, Canada.

We ran legal operations, got the owners and had them

hire attorneys and bring them to court and this type of thing.

He seized these race horses. He tried to peddle them

in Europe and up in Canada. We ran opposition against that

Bright Stock.

What is that?

leavy, heavy oil, and since Cuba -- 85 percent of

her energy comes from oil, this was considered 'à critical

commodity. Bright Stock can be -- oh, it is almost like tar,

melted tar, and it can be cut into additives, lubricants, this

type of thing, and this was critical to the Cuban economy. So

we had an oil firm purchase this Bright Stock from a dealer fori

which we reimbursed the quy and the Bright Stock was eventually

sold in Africa.

Do you know of any sales of such materials that

were made within the United States?

Resales, I should say.

Let's taik about economic warfare for a couple of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of

economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

A

Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

regime, his credit vorthiness, and this type of thing. We

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, I

guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had jumped from

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something

like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel kept

saying that he had such a

poor crop and this type of thing

and

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because

some of our own island assets told us they were out there cutting

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any

place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he

could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers in

New York, we surfaced this lact and the price of sugar took a

real tumble and all of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the worid price because he didn't have any

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't

want him to get the exchange.

So it was those types of

activities.

Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen or U.S.

companies

enlisted in that effort?

Oh, yes.

In what manner did you use U.S. companies and

businessmen?

A Well,

ive simply used them as the experts. A great

many - the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the

American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything when they had to pull out. Sugar is the

lifeline of Cuba as far

as any exchange, foreign exchange, this

type of thing, and it was

naturally our Number 1 target. So it

was only natural that ve would go to the American businessmen.

What kind of assistance did you seek or obtain from

these businessmen?

A

well, we sinply calked with them about why - you

know, the market conditions. were, why the price was rising, if

ve could find out that fidel has plenty of sugar, what would

happen to the market price. This type of thing.

They were used as consultants, basically.

We had

a French firm, Societe le Nickel, who was

buying almost the entire output of the Nicaro mines. And this

French firm ex ported to the United States.

So we went to

the Treasury Department and to the Foreign Assets Control

people and said, isn't there

something we can do to stop these!

So they looked

Can you think of anything, any other type of para-

No. I really can't, no.

Right.

Which would include Cuban refugees.

Right.

Yes. No, not to my knowledge. You have got to remember

that probably down at our Domestic Training Station we

probably have people on detail from other - from the military

branches in the Government, but other than that I don't think

that -- of course, during the Bay of Pigs operation we also

had people detailed into the Agency.

Now, the training of persons involved in maritime

operations, I take it, was conducted in part within the

United States and in part outside of the United States.

Is

that correct?

Now, what kinds of operations are included within

this category of maritime operations?

A

Well, the infiltration operations, infiltrating

agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage

raids. That is about the extent of it.

Now, when did these operations commence? Was it

shortly after the Bay of. Pigs?

A

I would - I think these operations were probably

at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,

1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December

1968, something like that.

Why was the program terminated?

A

First of all, it was too expensive. It wasn't provid-

ing enough intelligence and it simply wasn't - economically,

wasn't sufficient for what the investment was.

Q

You say the agents were getting wrapped up.

A

Yes.

What do you mean by that?

When we infiltrated an agent, Cubans would identify

him and capture him.

were conducted by the Agency I trust were approved by the

Forty Committee?

Every operation received a specific approval from

the Forty Committee.

frequently - they would either approve the operation or say

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

phase for communications and this type of thing. And these

things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of

Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were

exiltrating people, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Every Government agency or enforcement agency or military

agency that had any involvement whatsoever, and the entire

thing was coordinated.

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother

ship in place and rubber boats and the UDI people to go in to

see if there were mines and this type of thing on the shore

before you go. So he may have considered that all these train-

ing exercises were operations but no way did he ever partici-

pate in any three or 400 active operations into Cuba.

a successful operation. By that, I mean they didn't do as

much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out

because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type

of operation that we did.

As I recall, another time we took a team in to burn

some cane fields. Really, the classical operations that we

did in the maritime activities were the infiltrations and

exfiltrations.

Were any CIA operations run out of Guantanamo?

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our

own oil, substandard. Adaitives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.

The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going

ta

extend the credit.

The railroad system was in total disaster. The

Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus

the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment

because they were used to good American equipment. And these

were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

In your experience at the Agency can you think of

any other analogus or similar paramilitary operations run

from a base in the United States?

No.

rubber boats. We had a number of craft in, say, the 27 to

painted and they looked like they wouldn't even float but

they had the fastest engines in them. They could outrun any-

thing. They were extremely well armed. We had our under

and these other entities were under commercial cover, of non-

Did any of these companies actually engage in any

legitimate commercial activities?

A

Not to my knowledge, no.

None of them - were any of them in competition with

firms in that area?

A

These are probably what we would call devised

facilities. They were probably registered with the State of

Florida and they paid taxes

and this type of thing, but if one

was. blown or became known, we just crossed that out of

existence and started up a new one.

What did Eugenio Martinez do when he wasn't running

these operations?

Well, he was down -- this is one of the reasons, as

I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that

contract, that retainer; because of the years that he spent

under such strict operational discipline down in the Keys.

Obviously, he didn't stay down there all the time. He

came back - he might come back once a month,. or something

like that, to see his family, perhaps once every two weeks

if he got some time off.

to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

22

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the

leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

firm buy it back from the Soviets.

When was the Miami Station established?

A

As a station?

Yes.

I think in September 1961.

And that was several years before you became involved

in Cuban matters?

_A

Yes.

Do you know of any other facilities of that nature

You mean, targeted against the opposition?

Yes.

Of course, we have FR bases and DCD offices and

A

Right.

But I am talking about actual stations.

A

Operating stations, no.

This is the only such station in the United States

as far as you know, is that correct?

A

Right.

And was this station established to deal primarily

with Cuban activities?

A

Yes.

Cuban-related matters?

A

With Cuba, period.

Did it have, when it was established, any other

responsibilities with respect to western Hemisphere activities?

A

Not to my knowledge.

Entirely limited, then, to Cuban activities?

A

Yes, and in support of Cuban activity and other

countries in the Hemisphere.

activities, what was the size of the number of personnel

attached to that Station?

To that Station? Well, the Station had probably a

And what kind of facilities did the Station have in

Miami? Physical facilities.

A

Well, they were located on the south campus of the

University of Florida, I mean, the University of Miami, at

the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained

unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn

well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the

Dixie Highway inland. We had our own guard force.

Official cover?

A

No. Non-official.

No.

Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community,

how long could a non-official cover last?

Well, obviously it didn't, but it was research

activities. Funded -- it is a giant mechanism when you put

one of these things in for the funding and this type of thing,

• for: your ostensible customers, establishing bank accounts.

Yes, I understand.

So it was a research activity and the only people that

ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You

know, somebody would make an inquiry, you know, we can't accept

any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this

type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And out of

this one thing, of course,

then we were running these innumera-

ble other covers with different activities. The guard

force, of course, were like - well, they wore uniforms, similar

to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think

that there was -- in the later days at that site I think the

Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other

Government agencies, in other buildings, of course.

counterintelligence.

in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?

Not really. You have got to remember that the

Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a large

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-

thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of

hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-

tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from -

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts

which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting

to Case Officers and they would report on things in the

community, of people they thought were suspect and this type

of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau

and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved

in CI activity.

Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-

whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability

to properly staff the thing?

Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot

of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section

of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is

known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

and a lot of our Station officers

from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a

relationship there that had gone over a period of years

between the Agency and the Bureau.

The largest CIA station in the world.

At its height?

A.

Nothing comes anyplace close to it.

I wonder if you could describe briefly for the record

what the mors were.

A.

Well, the AÖTS were Cuban a Cuban intelligence

organization in exile. We full intended - this was part of the

overall contingency nlan that US Government had. Should Castro

ever be overthrown, these people would be the nucleus to go into

Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

Now, Ministry of the Interior, is that a euphemism

for Security Agency?

A.

Nell, in most countries of the world the Ministry of

Interior, unlike ours, is the security force, internal and.

A.

You mean in terms of vears?

Yes.

A.

Well, I would think that I would probably say from

about 1967, and I think the debriefings as such, of course --

we relied principally on the airlift for the people coming out

and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did -- cut off

about, I quess about 1970 or 171, in that timeframe --

I see.

A.

— that stonped the flow of the refugees, so we just

terminated that part of the activity.

D.

Well, in addition to debriefing refugees that came

in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any other

intelligence gathering functions -

A.

NO.

In the community?

A.

Well, I can't give you a real yes or no to that. I

would suppose that there is an outside possibility they could

have been used to debrief people within the community, within

the Cuban community, but we had in the organization - all these

people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an

On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime staff employee and he

had a couple of assistants, including a secretary. These people

were directly under his control: Though the organization as it

was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,

but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Officer.

Of course, if these people went out and did something on

You can't - you know what they are doing during their eight or

ten hours that they are going to work everyday but once they

leave, we don't know what they are up to.

Did they have CIA credentials?

A.

No sir

Did CIA levy any intelligence requirements upon these

people other than in their duties - in their debriefing

capacity, I should say?

A.

No. When -- there were - obviously there was a

standard debriefing form that covered questions of intelligence

interest or a battle, you know, anything -- economic questions.

morale, and this type of thing. When these questions -- when.

these people were cebriefed and the debriefer wrote up the

report, it would be sent from the AMOTS over. to the Station.

If the debriefing report contained something of positive

intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer - well, not the

Case Officer but a staffer in the Station may or may not jot

down some additional requirements and ask that that person be

recontacted and asked specific questions.

Now, in addition to debriefing, what else did this

smaller broup of AMOTS do for the Agency in the Miami area?

A.

This was their prime purpose.

Before ve move on to further discussion of the AMOTS

could you briefly describe for me what role the CIA plays in

CIA doesn't resettle Cuban emigres.

A.

What Agency is charged with that responsibility?

Health, Education and Welfare.

Does CIA play any role in that process?

A.

We may assist if we are. asked but the idea of the whole

airlift was having relatives here. for somebody to claim you when

you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the

Government, and normally when

these refugees came in, they were

processed through the Center and then they had a place down on

Biscayne Boulevard they called. Freedom House and this was, of

course, all run by HEw, and they - i need be and they had to

stay overnight or stay several days, HEW would put them up and

All right. Where are these files now?

A.

They are in the Headquarters here. A great many of

them were really destroyed. It got to be rather comic. We

went down there several years ago just looking through the files

to see what kind of shape they were in and they had such great

information for intelligence value in there as a picture of a

gal who might be the daughter of a Cuban refugee who just won

a swimming meet. It got rather ridiculous. So we purged those

files and took out that material, you know, which just didn't

have any pertinancy at all.

Well, that is right.

So I guess I won't ask you to do so, but I want to ask

you this. I trust that there is the possibility that some of

these files do contain what you in the trade refer to as deroga-

tory information?

A.

I would assume so.

And that so much of them may - some of the subjects

of those files may now be American citizens?

Right.

And finally I take it that no effort has been made to

study that particular situation?

A.

WEll, we did make an effort to do it at one time:

Government allowed a lot of this to go on for awhile but I guess

about 1965 or 1964 they got a little tired of it and they

started to tighten up.

I am sure the

AMOTS were in part responsible for proposing

alerting us and in turn we alerted the enforcement agencies whenl

there was going to he a raid against Cuba by one of these

militant groups.

A number of times raids were aborted, picked

up by the Coast Guard or Florida Coastal Patrol or the Bureau,

These people were arrested?

Oh, yes.

Prosecuted?

Any of them American citizens?

I don't know whether this guy - well, you know, they

are still after this Masferrer and this guy Donestevez. I don't

so many charges and he was a Cuban exile that made it big here.

He was a boat manufacturer, small boats, but whether he ever

served any time or not I don't know.. I know he was convicted

I understood vou to say that it was your impression in 1963

that large numbers of Cuban exiles, Cuban people in the southern

United States, talker ahout and believed that they were invoived

in the CIA sponsored activities. Is that true?

A.

That is richt.

Was it also your understanding and your impression

that there was a good deal of talk among this Cuban

1 element in

the southern United States about plans or prospects

for the

assassination of Fidel Castro?

A.

I would say no.

i don't think there was - you have

got to remember that these people were embittered. They lost

their homeland, their sossessions, they lost everything and theyl

blamed it all on one man.

Yes.

And when rid tou conduct that inquiry?

I have done it twice that I recall and the most recent

one was I guess - I am just trying to think.

Well, it wasn't

too long ago because ve dia have an inquiry and ve sotained the

time and the attendance records from the office of Finance which

showed that Howard Hunt was on sick leave on that day.

Was this just fairly recently?

A.

Yes.

I understood rom what files I have seen, Mr.

Sturbitts, that the only records that were available from the

Office of Finance shower that he had had nine hours of sick leave

during the two-week pay seriod ending the 23rd of November but

that the records were not available as to how much sick leave

or annual leave had been taken on any particular day.

A.

Well -

Am I mistaken?

A.

As I recall, he was in a duty status one day and a

sick leave status the next day and back to duty the next day.

I would have to check that with my Budget and Fiscal Officer.

He is the chan that cot that for me..

Well, the membership varied. As I said, we were

principally interested in the leadership of the organizations.

Once the organization was established and the leadership took

over, then they would take care of enlisting the, I guess,

getting membershig from the Cuban exile community to join.

What were their functions, the fronts?

Well, it was to bring some unity out of this chaotic:

thing of the splinter groups and get -- as I said, it was a

political organization in exile.

Did they conduct any operations?

No, not that I know of.

We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement

that they have identified these people by nationality before

we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time

they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens

which we promptly sent

back to them and told them we could
