SUBJECT

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

Reference is made to the memorandum W. C. Sullivan

to C. D. DeLoach dated 3/5/70; captionedi as above.

At that

time the Director was advised this Division would make an

analysis of each situation cited in the memorandum of

Special Agent Sam J. Papich relative to grievances which CIA

might hold in connection with relations with the FBI.

Enclosed will be found an analysis of 38 items

(2 are contained in one memorandum, making a total of 37

memoranda), In substance our analysis does not show any

real reason why CIA would raise any issue in connection with

37 out of the 38 items.

The recommended action in each of

these cases would logically close the suttor.. In one memprandum

the 37th itemse, it is recommended that a careluty wordec

letter to CIA outlining policy and the basic elements oi

intelligence and counterintelligence wok affecting the

United States be sent to that Agency. The purpose of this is

to protect

the Bureau by giving CIA a dance to make any

comments, if it has any, in regard to the current utilization

• pf sources and facilities affecting both CIA and the Bureau.

If CIA replies that it is satisfied with the current intelli

gence conditions in this area, we willaut this particular

matter to rest and we will have their letter in the file.

This Division will take any end all steps to comply

With the Director's wishes in this matier and

in any other

concerning which this Division is involved.

BACKGROUND OF CASE

a Hollywood motion picture

producer,

was recruited by soviet intelligence in 1935.

From

1947 to 1957 he was operated as a double agent by the FBI. This

was an extremely sensitive counterintelligence operation involving

Soviet intelligence

activities in the United States in which

Morros traveled behind the "Iron Curtain for meetings with his

Soviet principals.

jfk (1)(a)

Information obtained by

from his Soviet contacts

was disseminated

to interested

including the Central

Intelligence Agency. On January 25, 1957, Jacks Soble, Myra Soble,

and Jacob Albam were arrested in New York on charges of conspiracy

to commit espionage against the United States.

PROBLEM WITH CIA

JFELICAD

On March 16, 1954, the Bureau disseminated

information received from

Jto heads of

the various

intelligence agencies, including, CIA.

By letter of March 27, 1954,

Lieutenant General C. P. Cabell,

Acting Director of CIA,

criticized the information and, in effect, characterized it as

"fabrication or the product of

a paper mill," which conclusion

Cabell stated had been applied to many similar disseminations in

the past from apparently the same source.

By letter of April

5,

1954, the Bureau informed CIA that it was believed that no useful

purpose

would be served in making any future dissemination to

CIA of information received from this

source.

On April 9, 1954, Mr. Allen Dulles,

then Director of

CIA, advised Liaison Agent Papich that he had been looking into the

matter and there was no question in his mind but that his

agency

had acted sturgly in

transmitting such a letter

to the Bureau.

The Director noted "OK but before anything

goes to CIA from this source I want to pass on it.

Subsequent to the foregoing three disseminations were

made to interested agencies, including CIA, based on information

The FBI

of course, fully realizes the difficult problems

involved in surveilling American Communists in foreign countries.

At the same time,

however, it must

be pointed out that in the present

emergency each individual

Communist investigation, routine or

otherwise, should receive proper attention when the subject concerned

travels to foreign countries. As you no doubt realize, the Communist

Party, U.S.A,, represents a potential force as far as espionage

and sabotage

operations are concerned.

Therefore, even minor

members

of the Party could become involved in delicate operations.

As pointed out in the discussions between Mi. Deloach and representa

tives of your agency, the travels of Comnunists fron the United

States to Mexico are

very likely to become much greater, thereby

proposing a more serious problem than is now faced.

The IBI has for some time utilized the Immigration and

Naturalization Service

Watch List as a source of information concerning

the travel of Communists. Although representing an excellent method

of ascertaining this type of information, at the same time the FBI

is not afforded any advance warning from

this source as to the return

of the Communist. Party member to the United States.

Therefore, the

investigation of that member becones delinquent in view of the

active investigation 1s not initiated at the time of his re-entry.

It is, therefore, believed that this particular source of information

not be satisfactory in lieu of intormation from your agency

which would notify us in advance of the return to the United States

of the Communist Party member in question.

With respect to the FBI advising your agency when the

services of the Mexican Police may be utilized in individual cases,

this Bureau will be most-happy to advise you of those "sensitive

cases" which are considered too delicate for referral to the

Mexican

Police, or foreign factions. With regard to the remainder of

investigations,

however, we shall defer to your judgment as to

whether you wish to utilize the Mexican Police or not.

jurisdiction of the Office of Special Operations in foreign

intelligence matters allows for a more over-all knowledge of the

Mexican Police than

this Bureau presently possesses. Therefore, we

suggest that you weigh the facts in each individual case and consider

whether the Mexican Police should be called in or not..

Concerning the ranking importance of cases, it is the

opinion of this Bureau that the facts provided your agency in each

individual case will determine the methods of investigation you

wish to apply.

It is not, therefore, considered necessary for the

FBI to point out

the importance of each matter referred to your

agency.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

THE ABEL CASE

Item #3 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses the

Abel case.

According to Papich, CIA felt it was not given proper

recognition for its contribution in the case, in that it took the

risk and responsibility of transporting Hayhanen from Paris to the

U. S. in 1957 after the Bureau declined to become involved in this

transportation; that after a short handling period in the U. S. the

Bureau dropped

Hayhanen, an alcoholic, because he became a problem

and CIA took the responsibility of safeguarding him, giving the

Bureau free access to him and time to develop leads

leading to the

apprehension of Abel; that CIA was responsible for making Hayhanen

mentally and physically capable to testify at the Abel trial; also,

CIA incurred heavy expenses, all for the benefit of the Bureau;

further, the Bureau never thanked CIA for its cooperation nor did it

see fit

to inform the Attorney General or the White House of the

role played by CIA.

BACKGROUND OF THE SITUATION:

Abel is the Soviet intelligence officer who was uncovered

in the U. S. in 1957 through the defection of Reino Hayhanen,

Abel's assistant.

On the night of May

7, 1957, James Angleton of CIA advised

Mr. Belmont that Hayhanen had

walked into the American Embassy in

Paris about three days ago and was referred to fIA. He claimed he

was a Soviet agent in New York since 1952 and gave certain details

to back up his story. He claimed he was ordered back to Moscow

and

got "cold feet" in Paris and wanted to cooperate with American

Officials. He was in a highly emotional state which led CIA to

question his mental' stability. It was the opinion of Mr. Belmont

that no steps should be taken to return Hayhanen to the U. S. until

the story was substantiated or demolished to reflect his actual

status.

Our New York Office immediately instituted investigation,

based on Hayhanen's disclosures

and was not able to prove or

disprove his story. On May 3, 1957, CIA was informed of the

facts developed by our investigation and asted what action it

intended to take regarding Hayhanen's return to the U.s.

May 9, 1957, Angleton advised of a report received from ClA,

PaTIS,

revealing that Hayhanen had suffered almost a complete mental

breakdown and that in view of his condition,

arrangements were

made by CIA for him to be returned to the U.S. by plane.

May 10, 1957, Hayhanen was returned to the U.s, in the

a CIA agent.

On arrival our lew York Agents were at the airport

to take him over, but because of his emotional state, he was

confined at the U.S. Marine Hospital in Staten Island until

lay 15, 1957, when he was released to the custody of our Agents.

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) authorities

arranged for his confinement in the U.s. Marine hospital,

Staten Island for psychiatric examination through the U.S.

Public Healtn Service. (Liaison Agent Papich had previously

conferred with an INS

official who had stated that if Hayhanen's

condition warranted confinement upon his arrival in the U.s.,

an order would have to be issued by the U.S. Public Health

Service).

Hayhanen and his wife were placed in a midtown hotel

by New York Agents and were under bureau control from lay 15, 1957,

until June 20, 1957, when they were taken to their residence

Peekskill, New York, at their request. All expenses tor theit

maintenance vere paid by the Bureau.

During this period Hayhanen

and his wife were becoming a problem because of heavy drinking

and irrational behavior.

1957, Abel was located by Bureau Agents when

Agents and the Department to have Hayhanen testify against Abel in a

criminal prosecution were unavailing.

With the Department's

concurrence, we arranged for INS authorities to arrest Abel on

June 21, 1957, on an alien warrant.

After Abel's arrest, the

Department continued to raise questions concerning Hayhanen's

willingness to testify in an espionage

prosecution against Abel

and requested the Burea to press Hayhanen in that regard.

took the position that any efforts to induce layhanen to testify

should be made by the Department, as we realized that Hayhanen

would undoubtedly want assurances, such as remaining in this

country and financial assistance,

and the Department was so

advised.

The Department was

also advised that the Bureau

would no longer pay Hayhanen's subsistence and

that other

arrangements would have to be made. In an effort to solicit

Hayhanen's cooperation, the Department conferred with Allen

Dulles of CIA to determine if CIA would be willing to sponsor

not only to sponsor Hayhanen but also to assist in his rehabilitation

On July 21, 1957 a CIA representative was placed

in touch with Hayhanen by New York Agents for this purpose.

Our Agents also arranged for IBI's access to Hayhanen vhenever neces

Subsequently, Hayhanen agreed to testify and appeared

before a federal grand jury on August 5 and August 6, 1957.

As indicated above, we located Abel on June 13 and

he was taken into custody by INS on June 21, 1957. On July 21,

1957, over a month later, CIA instituted arrangements for

Hayhanen's rehabilitation.

While CIA undoubtedly incurred heavy expenses on

ichalf of Hayhanen, it was not at the request of the Bureau

but at the request

of the Department.

Regarding CIA's complaint that the Bureau never thanked

it for its cooperation, it is nointed out that a letter irom

the birector was sent to Mr. Dulles on November 19, 1957,

It pointed out the excellent

cooperation of James Angleton and his staff with the Bureau

DECLASSIFIED BY SP-QALIA 11C

ON 1-10-01

Item No. 4 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70 discusses

belief by CIA officials that damaging publicity regarding

William P. Bundy emanated from a Bureau report. Bundy

was a CIA official at the time and the publicity was felt to

be damaging to CIA. CIA apparently was of the belief that

the Bureau leaked the information to Senator Joseph McCarthy

who then released the information to the press.

Bureau files reveal that in a discussion between

SA Papich and Allen W. Dulles, then head of CIA, on 7/10/53

Dulles inquired of Papich as

to where McCarthy could get infor-

mation such as that released concerning Bundy. Papich

immediately informed Dulles that if Dulles was under any

suspicion that the Bureau might be disseminating such infor-

mation to Senator McCarthy he was definitely wrong and off base.

Papich also told Dulles that the results of the Bureau

investigation concerning Bundy had also been made available

to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as well as other

interested agencies. Dulles

told Papich that he definitely

did not feel that the Bureau

was involved in the McCarthy

releases to the press and that he was sorry if there had been

an impression he suspected the Bureau.

There is nothing in Bureau files concerning Bundy

which would indicate that the Bureau did, in fact, supply any

information concerning Bundy to Senator McCarthy or the news

media. There was considerable publicity concerning Bundy

at the time and it is noted that due to the fact that Bundy

was the son-in-law of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson

there was possibly an element of potential embarrassment to

matter by Republican Senator McCarthy. It is also noted

that copies of reports of Bureau investigation concerning

Bundy had been disseminated, in addition to CIA, to Civil

Commission, Army and the Attorney General:

out between CIA and Senator Joseph McCarthy after McCarthy

publicly quoted from a document, not identified, which spelled

out Bundy's contribution to the Alger Hiss fund. The files

indicate that CIA alleged that the AEC had leaked the

information in question to Senator McCarthy.

BUREAU DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

#MORIG

CONCERNING JAY LOVESTONE

DECIASSIFIED BYSPEAR

0x 1-10-01

Item number five in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich with his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses a question raised by

former CIA Director Allen Dulles concerning the propriety of FBI

dissemination of information concerning Jay Lovestone, who in the late

1920's headed the U. S. Communist Party, thereafter became completely

disillusioned with the Party, and subsequently occupied an executive position

with American Federation of Labor.

The particular information referred to by Mr. Dulles had been

furnished FBI by Spencer Miller, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Labor.

Miller made several accusations against CIA. Mr. Dulles took the position

that dissemination of the allegations to the White House, Attorney General

and Department of State had placed Dulles on the spot because the Miller

data was not a complete story.

BACKGROUND:

CIA advised that on 12/4/53 Miller had informed CIA representa-

tives abroad that he had evidence pointing toward Jay Lovestone's being a

communist and active agent, and that Lovestone might shortly be exposed

by the McCarthy Subcommittee of the Senate as the chief of the third great.

Soviet ring after Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White. When interviewed by

Bureau 1/7/54 he furnished no information indicating that Lovestone was

engaged in espionage activity and appeared to have an axe to grind insofar as

Lovestone was concerned. He acknowledged everything he?had ceme to him

secondhand. Results of interview were furnished CIA by letter.

On 1/22/54 Attorney General advised the Director that Dr. Milton

Eisenhower had told him of a conversation he had with Spencer Miller. The

Attorney General said he told Dr. Eisenhower he would have Miller inter-

viewed to get the whole story and asked that we conduct the interview.

On 1/25/54 we wrote the Attorney General about the previous

interview with Miller and advised we would have him interviewed again to

secure any additional data he might have. Miller was reinterviewed

the same day and results were sent to Attorney General 1/27/54.

Subsequently, on 2/19/54, Governor Sherman Adams called

the Director from White House about the Miller situation.

The

Director advised Governor

Adams that he had personally talked to

Miller for two hours the

previous day and had concluded that Miller

was obsessed with the charges he was making and while he appeared

to be a brilliant and well educated man he did not appear to have

specific details.

On the day the Director spoke with Miller, 2/18/04, he

referred Miller to Domestic Intelligence Division where a detailed

interview was conducted and results incorporated in a 20-page memo-

randum, copies of which were furnished Attorney General, Governor

Adams, CIA and State Department.

We interviewed Miller at the specific instructions of the

Attorney General based upon a White House request and dissemination

of interview results to Attorney General and White House was not

only proper but required under the circumstances.

CIA and State

Department received results since allegations concerned officials

and operations of those agencies.

Miller furnished names of

persons who he said could support his allegations and we interviewed

them and disseminated results. Mr. James Angleton of CIA commented

on 3/13/54 that when the Miller information was first received at

that Agency some officials gained the impression FBI was deliberately

collecting and disseminating data solely for the purpose

of "hurting"

CIA. Angleton said results of interviews and investigation conducted

by Bureau had clearly demonstrated to CIA officials that FBI was

living by its well-known tradition and reputation of developing

facts and reporting information in an impartial manner. He said

on the previous day all officials, including Dulles, commented the

Bureau was.

following the Lovestone case in conformity with its

well established reputation of getting all the facts.

In view of

this, there is no basis for believing that at this time CIA would

raise any charges of unfair conduct on the part of Bureau in its

handling of the Miller matter.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None.

We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue

of this matter.

Item six in material submitted to the Director by Sam

Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 mentions occasions in the 1950's

when CIA complained that officials visiting the United States

under CIA sponsorship were disappointed because they had no

CIA felt contact with Bureau

officials had significant benefits, left lasting favorable

impressions because of the FBI's worldwide reputation, and

they were left with suspicions there was friction between the

and nothing more.

Memorandum 5/31/56 from Mr. Roach to Mr. Belmont,

captioned

"Visit at Bureau by Foreign Police and Intelligence

Officials," (Bureau file 94-2-32781) recommended for Director's

approval that Liaison would (1) inform CIA tours afforded to

foreign police officials and security officials would continue

to be of a restricted nature and the visitors will only view

facilities normally seen by the public, and (2). that such

foreign officials would not be interviewed unless it appeared

Ito the Bureau's advantage.

In regard to 1, the Director noted,

"I thoroughly agree.

I am not too keen anyway about such tours.

We were 'burned' in the Johns matter."

The Director noted in

regard to 2, "I see no need of interviews."

Doctor Otto John was an official of the West German

security service who was closely associated with CIA and who

was alleged to have defected to the East Germans.

In his memorandum, Papich emphasized that for the past

several years there was no basis for complaints with regard to

Bureau treatment of foreign officials coming to U.S. under CIA

SUBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CIA

COL. JOHN GROMBACH (PAT O'BRIEN)

Background: Item number eight in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his: memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

relations between Bureau and CIA with Grombach, head of private

intelligence network (O'Brien was Grombach's aide who had liaisor

one cartoon

with Bureau).

Problem;

Papich states we never informed CIA we were receiving

Information from Grombach which was also of interest to CIA;

and that while it is possible Grombach had given same data to

CIA, we do not know.

JFK(I)(B)

Analysis: Grombach was financed by CIA during early 1950s (e•g.,

CIA budgeted $650,000 for Grombach in 1952) • (62-77306-60) There

is ample evidence CIA knew we were receiving information from

Grombach. We do know some information was given by Grombach to

CIA and

conference in early 1951 between CIA officials and Grombach when

it was agreed information might be furnished directly to FBI by

Grombach, provided CIA was advised by Grombach of what was given.

(62-77306-23) Moreover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested

Bureau's views regarding validity of information we were receiving

from Grombach and

asked for our views regarding method to be

employed in channeling information from Grombach to Bureau.

Significantly, under procedure then, Grombach directed communica-

JFK(I)(B)

tions to CIA with copies to Bureau.

CIA was told that

as it

appeared Grombach was an appendage of CIA, Bureau was not recom

mending any method of dissemination and it was up to CIA to handle

problem. (62-77306-25)

In the ensuing period, dispute arose between CIA and

Grombach over channeling of information and Bureau made every

effort to stay out

of dispute.

In late 1952,

for example, Helms

inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination had changed.

He was told they certainly had not and again informed that Bureau's

desire was to receive all information of interest no matter how

received. (62-77306-27)

Our position of not becoming involved in

'Grombach-CIA dispute reiterated'on other occasions. (62-77306-36, 69,

(SECKEN

On the other hand, there were instances where we

received information from Grombach which was of either an

administrative or intelligence interest to CIA and we did

not intorm CIA.

These instances covered period both prior

and subsequent to the contractural relationship between CIA

and Grombach which was from 4/51 to 7/54 (62-77306, unrecorded

memo 11/29/55, Belmont to Boardman re Grombach). For example,

Grombach wrote a confidential letter dated 7/30/48 to former

Assistant to the Director D. M. Ladd which contained infor

mation of interest to CIA. This letter contains a penciled

notation:

"This info. not to be given to CIA. per DML--OHB"

(62-77306-7).

Memorandum 10/11/50 from A. H. Belmont to

Mr. Ladd

contains information from O'Brien concerning

Grombach's intentions to plant microphones in Finland to

cover meetings attended by Russian high staff.

It was

observed in the. memorandum that at that time O'Brien

and

Grombach had no relations-with CIA and that Grombach's

intended operation was under primary responsibility of CIA.

No indication this information given to CIA by Bureau

(65-58725-10) •

O Brien furnished Bureau a memorandum dated

6/29/54 entitled "Termination Memorandum to FBI" which

informed of the termination of contract between Grombach

and CIA.

In the memorandum it is pointed out that Grombach

will continue to receive raw material from the field and

that while he will no longer be in a position to translate,

evaluate, publish, etc., Grombach desires to forward such

material

to Bureau as Grombach would not trust any other

agency. The memorandum also states that Grombach has continued

the flow to the Bureau of all reports he felt Bureau would

be interested in even though Grombach received a written

order specifically directing him to not give Bureau any

thing. (62-77306-70).

Item number nine in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

the Hoover Commission survey of CIA operations in 1954.

According

to Papich, there was talk within CIA that the Bureau bad furnished

the names of subversives within CIA to Senator McCarthy.

Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wisc) was Chairman of the

Senate

Investigations Subcommittee.

General Mark Clark headed the Task Force which

surveyed CIA operations between 9/54 and 6/55. In 10/54, CIA

alleged that the McCarthy Committee was attempting to develop

information regarding CIA operations.

According to the Washington

Star, 10/1/54, McCarthy said CIA was

"one of the worst situations

we have as far as communist infiltration is concerned."

He said

he would give his data relative to this matter to Clark's Task

Force.

According to the Washington Star, 1/15/55, McCarthy

said he had given Clark information relative to alleged communist

infiltration of CIA.' As of 1/17/55, CIA had not received from

Clark the names of those considered security risks but CIA

believed it had done a good job of removing security risks and

believed that it was in good shape.

On 1/21/55, the Task Force requested name checks on

security risks named

by McCarthy. Memoranda containing the

results of those checks were given to the Task Force on 2/8/55.

On 5/13/55, the Bureau received a letter Irom Clark asking Ior

investigations relative to character, reputation, and loyalty

of individuals mentioned as security risks. CIA

was aware of

the names as me asked it for identifying data concerning them.

Clark was later advised that the investigations would entail

interviews at CIA, review of its programs, inquiries in foreign

countries, and the like and he withdrew his request.

Item number 10 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum of

3/5/70 discussed our furnishing leads to our Legal Attaches

(Legats) without advising Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

or requesting the Agency to handle the lead.

The observations of Special Agent Papich in this

matter are broad and

general in nature. His presentation is

hinged upon the premise advanced by the Agency that "internal

security" cannot be separated from "counterintelligence,"

thereby necessitating our advising CIA of requests to our

Legats to have leads covered in foreign countries.

The Manual

Instructions, Section 102, page 23,

states CIA's responsibilities

include collection, collation, evaluation, coordination and

information. CIA does not have,

among other things, responsibility for "internal security

functions."

In the absence of unusual situations,: we forward

investigative leads pertaining to our cases in countries where

we have

liaison coverage to the particular Legal Attache

concerned.

Through his contacts the Legat arranges for the

necessary investigation and submits the desired information

according to our reporting needs. The Legat coordinates.

this activity on a local level..

It is more desirable to have our representatives

request investigation abroad in order to achieve maximum coverage,

and to maintain tight control so we can insure that we fulfill

our responsibilities.

situation in Rio de Janeiro (Rio]in 1959 concerning strainec

relations which had developed between former Legal Attache (Legat)

According to Papich the Ambassador alleged that

By letter dated October 1, 1959, the new Legat, Rio,

Item number (13) in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

a problem presented by the Phoenix Office in June, 1957;

concerning the Bureau's handling of informants on

These informants were operated inside

The problem was predicated on situations which might arise as

the result of CIA endeavoring to develop informants who were

already being handled by the Bureau.

BACKGROUND:

The Director initiated BOCOV in 1948 to fill a void

in the lack of coverage in the 25-mile zone south of the U.S.

Mexican border on the part of CIA and Immigration and Natural-

ization Service (INS).

The program, which at first involved

3 and subsequently 5 of our border offices including Phoenix,

was designed to detect and neutralize anti-U.S. activities by

subversives in that zone.

JFK(I)(B)

In June, 1956, CIA assigned a representative to the

JFK()(B)

PROBLEM:

By airtel 6/8/57, Phoenix advised that the CIA

representative had endeavored to develop 3 Bureau sources in

and stated that it was discontinuing these sources unless

advised to the contrary by the Bureau.

SOLUTION:

This situation was analyzed in Bureau memorandum dated

6/14/57 wherein it was recommended that safeguards be established

to continue operating already established valuable sources even

though CIA also began using them; however, the information we

CIA REQUEST FOR BUREAU LECTURE

ON COMMUNISM IN THE U. S.

Item Number 15 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA San Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses the Director's

refusal of a 1958 CIA request for Mr. W. C. Sullivan to lecture

on communism before a CIA group. Papich stated that CIA accepted

this as an affront and a blatant refusal to cooperate on a most

important subject of interest to both agencies.

The files disclose that by letter 9/25/58 signed by

James Angleton, CIA requested Mr. Sullivan to address a selected

group of CIA personnel on the communist movement in the U.S.

CIA suggested dates of 12/9,10,or 11/58.

The Director by routing

slip attached to Angleton's letter commented, "It seems strange

that CIA should seek this when its top representative in

considers FBI as a bunch of mere 'flat-feet" and the dangers

of communism as something conjured up in the minds of the r'BI.

But then again I note request doesn't come from the Director.

nor even the Deputy Director of CIA."

Memorandum W. C. Sullivan to A. Belmont dated 10/1/58

made reference to CIA's request ard the Director's comments. It

recommended that the best interests of the Bureau would be served

by giving this lecture, not because of the information which

the information

could be conveyed to CIA on communism in the U. S., but because

it would give Sullivan an opportunity to raise a number of

questions himself of the group concerning CIA's own activities

in the field of communism.

It was pointed out that it could be

considered a bit of a challenge to see how much the FBI could

learn about the operation of CIA during the course of the lecture

and discussion rather than the converse. • Mr. Tolson recommended

that the request be declined and the Director concurred commenting,

"We cannot make Sullivan available to this outfit."

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA - TRAVEL OF

BUREAU INFORMANTS TO CUBA

Item Number 19 in the material. submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

the possible. travel of one of our Mexican border informants

to Cuba and whether our not advising CIA of this made us

potentially vulnerable to charges we were operating outside

no charges ve w

the U.S. without coordinating with CIA.

BACKGROUND:

This involved our plans to send a Border Coverage

Program (BOCOV) informant to a guerrilla training camp in

Cuba.

The trip never materialized.

In October, 1965, we were vitally interested

in

determining the location and extent of Cuban guerrilla training

sites being used

to prepare Latin American subversives to carry

out revolutions in their home countries.

EP 572-S, a Mexican

national residing in Juarez, Mexico, which is within the area

covered by the BOCOV Program, had infiltrated Cuban and Chinese

intelligence operations in Mexico City and had made himself

attractive to Mexican communist leaders who were planning to

pay expenses of sending guerrilla trainees to Cuba.

CIA CONSIDERATIONS:

EP 572-5 was an integral part of our top secret

BOCOV Program which is handled on a need-to-know basis.

We

had previously obtained material from CIA showing its primary

targets inside Cuba which allowed us to fully brief the informant

as to overall U.S. Government objectives and a procedure was

established for use in disseminating data to CIA if the trip

materialized which would fully protect our informant and not

jeopardize the BOCOV operation.

OUTCOME:

trip

During period informant was striving to arrange the

to Cuba his wife became mentally ill, extremely emotional

and temporarily deserted the informant.

This strained family

relationship

caused us to order El Paso to have informant cancel

efforts to make the trip to Cuba and thus no trip was ever made.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

After EP 572-S had moved to Guadalajara, Mexico,

which is outside our BOCOV area, in November, 1966, We

advised CIA of his past cooperation with us and interposed

no objection to his use by CIA in areas outside our

jurisdiction.

On 11/22/66 CIA stated it would consult us

should it initiate contacts with the informant. There is

no indication that CIA did use the informant and on 6/24/68

we discontinued EP 572-S as he was of no further value to us.

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his

memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph

dated 5/5/65 and entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic."

Special Agent (SA) Papich stated that due to the urgency of the

document Bureau did not obtain CIA clearance to include CIA

information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested

agencies, including CIA. According to SA Papich, CIA never

made any

protest although it considered our action a violation

of the "third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did

contain CIA data, it also set forth highly significant data

obtained by Bureau through our own informants. The CIA data

was biographical in nature and was used in the monograph to

ITEM (22) SOLO

ON 1-1-0

Item (22), SOLO, in the material submitted to the

Director by Special

Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

mentions that the Bureau could be vulnerable and charged with

failure to identify the source and coordinate with them on

this matter if they were to become cognizant of the high-level

foreign ramifications of this operation.

SOLO is the code word used to refer to the liaison

operation performed by our informants between the Communist

Party, USA, (CPUSA), and other communist parties of the world.

This operation basically is performed to gain

high-level intelligence concerning the Soviet Union's

financial support, domination and control of the CPUSA.

Attendant to this objective, our informants have met with and

discussed mutual problems with leaders of the various inter

national departments within the Soviet Government.

They have

also held discussions with CP leaders from other nations.

All information received as a result of this operation

which has foreign ramifications has been promptly disseminated

to CIA at the highest level.

It has not been considered desirable to identify our

sources in this case in view of. the sensitivity of the case

and the physical danger to the informants.

Considerable security precautions have been carefully

built into the SOLO operation both in the field and at the

Seat of Government to insure the fullest protection to its

security and to the safety of the informants involved.

Exposure

of the identity of these sources might jeopardize the

entire

operation.

Item #23 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses a letter

dated November 15, 1967,

from CIA which requested that the Bureau

check telephone toll calls from the home of one Robert kenneth Brow

who was allegedly harassing CIA in the Miami area Brown was JFK(D(B

supposedly seeking information concerning CIA's covert operations.

SA Papich states that we told CIA that we would not check the toll

calls on the basis that the information received was not sufficient

to justity investigation within the Bureau's jurisdiction. SA Papich

also states that "CIA accepted our response but there is no doubt

that the Agency characterized our position as a concrete example of

refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating to the

security of U.s. intelligence operations."

A review of Bureau files disclosed that a memorandum,

D. J. Brennan, Jr., to Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated November 17, 1967,

This memorandum encompassed the above facts and

recommended. that CIA Liaison Agent advise CIA that we would not

check the toll calls as requested. This memorandum and recommendation

was prepared by SA Papich. The pirector noted "OK H."

In addition to the above, on December 9, 1967, Brown

contacted our Miami Office and stated that he was writing a book

about CIA and offered to make the material

available to the Miami

Office.

Our Miami Office was advised that this information was of

• interest to CIA headquarters and instructions were furnished that

:1I Brown did furnish Miami with the information, jit would be given

to CIA. Brown did not follow through with his offer.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the fäcts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

Prior to 10/67, some of the Government agencies on

additional copies to expedite reading by key CIA officials

and to facilitate rapid utilization of the information.

The Director made a notation on the 10/4/67 CINAL:

"Please look over list of distribution. I have marked with

a dot those I question as to why they should recieve coples

and I do not think more than I copy should be sent anyone.

Item No. 26 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3-5-70 states that CIA by

dissemination of information through our Legal Attache to the

Intelligence Service.

This concerned certain Committee

for State Security (KGB) technical equipment which was obtained

from our sensitive Soviet defector

CIA letter 11-762 stated that a representative of

Intelligence Service informed CIA it received afore

mentioned information from our Legal Attache. CIA claimed

such dissemination abroad should have been coordinated with

CIA because of Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID)

5/2 which indicates that CIA shall be responsible for all U.S.

CIA claimed that pursuant

technical paraphernalia used by KGB.

Dissemination of above was

Item 27 of the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum. 3/5/70 indicates that Wise and

Ross had visited the Bureau in 1963 to gather material for a

book regarding U. S. intelligence agencies.

It was suggested

that CIA be advised

of this, and the Director noted, "I see no

reason for doing so."

Mr. Jones' memorandum to Mr. DeLoach, 8/28/63, reports

this visit and notes that Wise had asked for data concerning

the Bureau's internal security procedures and had asked concerning

other FBI operations, making no reference to CIA, with one

exception.

He did inquire as to whether there was friction between

the two agencies and was told that we cooperated closely and

maintained daily liaison with CIA.

It was on this memorandum

that the Director said he saw no reason for informing CIA con-

cerning the visit of Wise and Ross.

We later learned that their book, "The Invisible

Government," was furnished in the form of advance proofs to

CIA prior to its publication. We also received such proofs

from CIA through Liaison.

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Sam

Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations

Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,

CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to

assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by

providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist

Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa.

His memorandum added that we told that agency the FBI had no

informants available because they were necessary for our own

operations.

He claims we took the position since we saw no

benefit to be gained by loaning an informant on a short or

long term basis.

He states that CIA could argue that as early

as 1960 it had foresight to recognize the need for additional

coverage and when it appealed to the Bureau for assistance,

we did

not cooperate.

He refers to his memorandum dated 4/7/60

concerning this matter captioned "Communist Activities in Atrica."

The

memorandum referred to discloses that on 4/5/60

Herman Horton, Deputy Chief, Counterintelligence, CIA, stated

that communist organizations were rapidly increasing in strength

on the continent of Africa and that his agency found it most

difficult to establish effective penetration. Horton noted that

in this connection it was almost impossible for a white man to.

move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable

him to develop worthwhile sources.

He asked if the Bureau would

consider furnishing one of its

Negro informants or developing an

informant in the Communist Party, USA for eventyal use by CIA in

Africa.

Papich told Horton that if the Bureau had a good Negro

informant, we certainly were not interested in having his future

jeopardized nor did we want to lose his production.

added that it undoubtedly would be most difficult to take a Bureau

informant, have him'travel to Africa under some cover and still

be able to satisfactorily explain such activities to his communist

colleagues without becoming a target of suspicion. •Horton said

he recognized all this but asked if the Bureau would give

consideration.

informants were necessary for our own operations, particularly

in the communist field, and it recommended

and was approved

that CIA be orally informed that it is not possible to provide

an informant on a loan basis to be used in Africa.

Regrettably, the Bureau was not in a position to

Item #29 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in memorandum of 3/5/70, states that by Bureau

letter dated 10/23/64 we provided the

White House information

received by our Legat from U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg wherein

the latter was critical of intelligence operations, particularly

the overstaffing of personnel.

SA Papich comments

that we do

not know if CIA became knowledgeable regarding this letter but

could construe same as relating to its operations.

Our Legat, Paris, in a letter to the Director dated

10/19/64, set forth

the results of a conversation with Ambassador

William R. Rivkin at Luxembourg.

The latter was assigned by the

State Department to conduct a survey of the U.S. intelligence

operations in six European countries, assisted by representatives

of Defense, State

Department, and Bureau of the Budget.

Rivkin

remarked that the results of

the survey were appalling,

there

being 23, 000 military personnel in the six countries engaged in

intelligence operations and numerous CIA personnel.

He described

the lack of coordination between the military and CIA as

"scandalous." He stated the Offices of the Military Attaches

were grossly overstaffed

and he was recommending drastic cuts

and that duplicate administrative services be combined with those

of the embassies.

He made no mention of specific intelligence

Bro ta rarent pot only

operations nor did he elaborate on the lack of coordination.

Rivkin commented that on his return to the U.S., he intended to

see the President personally to bring this matter forcefully to

his attention.

Rivkin's comments were incorporated in a letter to

1-1-0

Item number 30 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970,

liscusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1963, as a result

of a communication the Bureau sent to the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB)•

It was pointed out that

in our communication to PFIAB we attributed certain information

to McCone, then Director of CIA, concerning the matter of

increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments. McCone

charged that the information attributed to him was not so

because he had never made any such statement and he could

prove it.

The fact was that the information relating to

McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had

indicated the information originated with McCone.

McCone

maintained that we should have checked with him before going

on record that any information had originated with him.

A review of the file in this matter discloses that

in April, 1963, Mr. Belmont along with Papich had discussed

with Richard Helms and James Angleton of CIA McCone's alleged

position with the PFIAB; that he was in favor of across the

board telephone taps on diplomatic establishments..

The

Bureau, of course, wasopposed to this and advised Helms that

we would request to make our position known before the board.

At the conclusion of the meeting in April, 1963, Helms

specifically asked what he should tell McCone and Mr. Belmont

told him he should tell McCone exactly what had occurred at

the meeting; that the Bureau was opposed to across the board

wire taps and the Bureau intended to so advise PFIAB.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:'

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue

Item number 32 in material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam J. Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

mentions Bureau letter 5/16/58 sent to the then Vice

President Nixon and containing a summary of CIA informa

tion concerning events in Latin America relating to

Mr. Nixon's trip there during 5/58.

According to SA Papich, most of the information

in above letter came from CIA. He commented that this

letter could be interpreted as raising question concerning

quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America. Papich noted

it is not known if CIA ever became aware of the letter.

Papich stated that General Robert Cushman, currently Deputy

Director of CIA, was attached to the then Vice President

Nixon's staff.

SA Papich pointed out that CIA, if aware of

above letter, could raise question as to violation of Third

Agency Rule.

source of the information set forth in our letter. The

last

paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the

impression gained

from a review of CIA reports indicates that

CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles

concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter

also stated as follows:

"It is significant that information in the indi

vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your

arrival in a particular country.

Therefore, there is a

question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist

organizations which would have led to the development of

information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of

your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding

instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958.

The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director

had a discussion with Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as

the first sentence of the above letter reads as

follows:

forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency

reports received from them on May 14, 1958."

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to

Mx. Nixon is contained in a memorandum Mr. R. R.

Roach, to

Mr. A. H. Belmont dated May 15, 1958, which was prepared for

the Director's information, The Director noted on this memo

Our letter to the Attorney General,

however, did not contain any observations regarding CIA

coverage in Latin American countries visited by Mr. Nixon and

of Mr. Nixon to determine if the contents of a letter from

the Director to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, regarding

Mr. Nixon's trip to South America could be leaked to the

press.

Colonel Cushman's request was set forth in memorandum

S. A. Nease to Mr. Tolson June 9, 1958, with the recommenda-

tion

that Colonel Cushman be advised that if the information

were to be given to the press, it would undoubtedly create a

serious problem as the FBI would then have violated CIA's

confidence since CIA was aware that SA Papich had reviewed

CIA's classified reports and, therefore, this information

should not be given to the press.

Both Mr. Tolson and the

Director agreed with the recommendation, and Colonel Cushman

was advised of our decision.

It is noted that Colonel Cushman

is identical with the individual who is now Deputy Director

of CIA.

Comments on Remarks in SA Papich Memo 3/5/70

1. That most of the information in our letter to

Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, came from CIA and that this

letter could be interpreted as raising the question concerning

the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

There is no dispute as to the source of the informa-

tion which was summarized en our hatter source was cIA. With

clearly indicated in our letter

regard to any question being raised as to the quality of

CIA's coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to

Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader

of the ClA reports - - that is,.

that the information from CIA

popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and

Mr. Nixon's arrival. Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since

he

was personally involved in demonstrations directed against

him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that

advance information from our responsible intelligence agency.

(CIA) may have been lacking.

We are not aware if CIA became knowledgeable of

our letter to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958. Under ordinary

conditions, we are not aware nor do we seek to identify any CIA

personnel who might be assigned to the White House staff.

As indicated above, Colonel Cushman, who was a member of

Mr. Nixon's staff in 1958 and who is now a Deputy Director

of CIA, was aware of our 5/16/58 letter and its contents.

We have no information that CIA ever registered any type of

protest in this matter.

3. That CIA technically could raise a question

as to violation of the Third Agency Rule as regards our

5/16/58 letter to Mr. Nixon.

The Third Agency Rule is intended to prohibit a

Government agency from disseminating information originating

with another Government agency in the absence of specific

authority to do so, and we follow this rule unless there

are overriding reasons.

With regard to our letter to

Mr. Nixon dated 5/16/58, we set forth information clearly

identified as having originated with CIA. This letter

was apparently prepared at the specific request of then

Vice President Nixon after conferring with the Director.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts

set forth, that CIA will make an issue

Of this matter.

Item number 33 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam J. Papich in his memorandum

3/5/70 discusses Herbert Itkin as an individual who was operated

as a criminal informant by the Bureau who furnished valuable

information and who has been a key witness, in the prosecution

of cases being handled by the Bureau.

Mr. Papich states that

the Bureau acquired access to Itkin through the CIA and that

although the CIA has never officially made any statements to the

Bureau, it has been bitterly disappointed

that the Bureau never

acknowledged CIA's assistance which the agency considered

extremely valuable.

Memorandum dated 2/20/63 from W. C. Sullivan to

Mr. Belmont captioned "James Hoffa" set out that James Angleton

of CIA advised SA Papich that CIA had briefed the Attorney General

concerning a source whom Mr. Angleton had used since World War II

and who subsequently has developed a close association with a

lawyer who does considerable work for the Teamsters Unions.

Angleton's source was confident that the lawyer could be developed

as a penetration which could "sink" Hoffa and all of his cohorts.

The Attorney General agreed with the CIA representatives that the

matter should be referred to the Bureau for handling.

who had the contact with the attorney

and at that time Angleton

stated that he did not want to get involved in any. investigative

aspects and wanted

to step out of the matter as soon as possible.

As a result, eventual contact was made with Herbert Itkin who

developed into a very productive source. Itkin has been publicly

identified as both a source of the FBI and CIA as a result of his

testimony.

/SECRET

The Bureau's success in handling Itkin can be

attributed to the know how of the SAs of the New York

Office because Itkin is a highly emotional individual

and he had aggravated marital problems, severe pressures

from his many business associates; therefore, it took

a high degree of skill in dealing

While it is acknowledged that CIA put us

giving us this original léad. It is also noted that

there is an obligation upon

Government agencies to

cooperate in the fullest and CIA's cooperation in this

matter was in accordance with the long standing policy

among all Government agencies.

Review of Itkin's file does not reflect any

instance where CIA indicated a displeasure in the Bureau

assistance in placing us in touch

in 1963 that he did not want to get involved in any

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPSWITH CIA

EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Item number 34 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 concerns

exchange of technical information with CIA, particularly as

it related to the technical surveillance field. Papich states

CIA exhibited its equipment to us, but for many years we declined

to show any of our devices, with some exceptons. • He states

that CIA never made an official protest but informally indicated

from time to time that the lack of exchange was prejudicial to

overall intelligence and internal security interests and implied

we were more open with the British in this area than with CIA.

Papich states this situation does not exist today as there is

a good exchange by the Bureau and CIA.

Our files reveal that through the years CIA has

furnished the Bureau a number of technical devices for our use

or inspection.

They have also furnished technical manuals obtained

abroad and briefed us on operational and technical aspects of

some

Of their operations abroad. Laboratory personnel have been

afforded

tours and briefings concerning CIA facilities and

equipment and in two instances Bureau personnel have been afforded

training at CIA schools. As recently as October, 1969, CIA

afforded a briefing to Bureau personnel concerring a Clandestine

Transmitter Activator, developed by their technical people and

offered to loan us one of these units as well as affora our

personnel training in the operation of the equipment.

COMMENTS OF THE LABORATORY

Similarly, Bureau records show substantial reciprocity

on the part of the FBI in developing and furnishing important

technical information to CIA over a period of many years..

Representative examples are cited below:

Prior to 1955 an important unsolved technical

intelligence problem involved desired access to

enemy intelligence and other security information

protected by combination-type locks (safe doors, and

the like).

Scientists in the FBI Laboratory were

able to solve this problem by

using X-rays from

radioactive materials to "see" into the interior of

a combination lock and

thus recover the combination;

without trace of tampering or other indication that

the lock had been compromised.

This was a scientific

breakthrough of tremendous intelligence potential and,

with Bureau approval, our results and techniques were

made known to the appropriate CIA representatives..

CIA advised that they had theretofore spent thousands

of dollars in an intensive, but unsuccessful effort to

solve the same problem.

The impact of this scientific

discovery in permitting access to previously unavailable

intelligence had tremendous value for both the FBI and

CIA.

In approximately the late 50's and early 60's, both CIA

and FBI encountered

a new, highly sophisticated type

of secret writing placed

into use by the Russians for

communicating with espionage agents. In spite of a

massive technical effort mounted by CIA, scientists

of the FBI Laboratory were successful in first unraveling

the basic principles and techniques underlying this new

Russian system.

This important breakthrough thus permitted

for the first time a successful attack against the new

Russian secret ink communication system.

Because of its

extreme intelligence potential, with prior Bureau approval,

this development was made known to CIA, and its importance

to CIA is reflected in part by a letter addressed to the

Director of FBI by Allen W. Dulles, then Director of CIA,

under date of August 19, 1961, in which Dulles said, in

part, "For the past several years there has been

increasingly effective technical liaison between the

Technical Services Division of this Agency and correspond

ing components of your Bureau. . ." Dulles further

commented that Bureau technical personnel had "

• made

an outstanding technical contribution for which they are to

be highly .commended.

Their work not only has an important

impact in one sensitive area, but also has revealed a

chemical mechanism from which may well stem new high-level

secret writing systems. The discovery will have an

Subsequently, again with prior Bureau approval, whenever

it could be done without jeopardizing FBI operational

interests, the FBI on a continuing basis made available

of development which had come into the possession of the

level informants.

on 2/12/69 a sample of secret writing material used by

Boeckenhaupt to communicate with the Russians was

furnished to CIA by a representative of the FBI Laboratory.

The above items are representative outstanding examples

of FBI cooperation in developing and sharing highly important

technical information, and certainly the letter from CIA reflects

the satisfaction and importance which CIA attached to such

information received from the Bureau. Within general Bureau

policy guidelines, there were, of course, on a continuing basis

numerous other items of technical information shared with CIA

over the years, including briefings and exchange of visits.

eclear the

Items number 35 and 36 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum March 5, 1970, indicated

CIA has never understood why Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to

lecture at our schools and CIA was unbappy regarding our attitude

concerning exchange of information in the training field.

CIA by letter May 19, 1950, requested

it be permitted to

discuss training problems with

FBI training staff in view of

necessity of its maintaining relations with foreign police and

security agencies.

Following recommendations by the Executives

Conference, Bureau advised CIA by letter May 25, 1950, that we did

not believe FBI training staff could intelligently discuss training

methods with CIA since our staff was not knowledgeable concerning

conditions encountered by CIA in various foreign countries.

Since 1962, we have taken foreign police officers into the

National Academy through the Agency for International Development

(AID). These officers spent two weeks of orientation with AID and

after

graduation certain selective officers have been in touch with

CIA through AID. We are aware that CIA has used many of these

graduates as sources of information.

In 1966, the Director approved a request of CIA to have one

of its men

attend

the National Academy for purpose "to improve

capabilities of CIA personnel engaged in overseas police training

programs." As a result, a CIA Security Officer graduated from the

77th Session of the FBI

National Academy (March 7 - May 25, 1966) .

At the specific request of CIA, Bureau representatives have

addressed CIA intelligence personnel attending refresher-type

training courses on 31 occasions between June, 1962, and December,

1969.

discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief

that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance

in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.

Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich

to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy

of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

SECRET

CIA has repeatedly raised the issue in the past of

our coverage in the positive intelligence collection area and

we can reasonably expect similar issues to be raised in the

future.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

That we prepare a carefully worded letter to CIA

outlining policy and the basic elements of intelligence and

counterintelligence work affecting the United States and

forthrightly ask CIA if it is satisfied with the status quo

and if not what do they have to suggest as changes.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

DETAILS:

SECREI

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive

order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of

such information.

He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and

that facets of these investigations of violations of United States

laws serve

to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred

to by us as investigations of internal security matters.

Papich

notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

has been

restricted to the compliance with requests by

State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring

in some foreign country.

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of

vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development

and collection of cryptographic material.

According to Papich,

CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area

and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the

problem. Papich cites two cases L

010/69 and

_110/69) where CIA requests for technical surveil

Tance were declined by us with the suggestion to CiA that these

matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the

Attorney General.

(a)he Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,

changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate

international travel and in response to requests from CIA, the

Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA

regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United states.

On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with

CIA,

the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our

guard down as CIA has always outsmarted us because of our

gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the

field and Bureau offiçials results of the conferences with CIA

and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction in

the counterintelligence field.

This SAC letter (copy attached)

emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement

upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness

to

cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the

United States.

In approving this sAl letter, the director

noted "I hope there is no sneaker' in this.

Time will tell."

There has been no renewed request from CIA for

technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there

been any indication that such requests have been sent by CIA

to the Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest

in the past in these matters, we cannot rule out the possibility

the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired

coverage at some

time in the future.
