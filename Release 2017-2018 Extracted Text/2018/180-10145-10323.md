Cable 943114

11/13/76 Scret'

Wash Post news article indicates Ricardo Morales

Venez. Intelligence offical, reported to FBI that he had been

told of a plot to kill Pascal (Luis Andres Pascal Allende-

relative of Allende).

Otero said he went to DINA officials

and identified himself as a fugitive from the US.

At DINA HQS

said he was told the secret police support the Cuban exiles

cause

and would provide funds and arms for them in return

for a

"favor."

The favor was to kill Pascal and Anne Marie

Brussier -sic- Beausire - in Costa Rica before 2/22/76.

Bosch to be back-up if Otero failed in the mission.

According to Otero, he refused to do the favor, left Chile and

told Morales. Returned to Santiago and arrested two week s

earlier.

Bosch arrested 2/19/ entering Costa Rica and charged with

false passport and plotting to kill Secy of State Henry Kissinger,

Pascal and Brussier.

No trial, Bosch deported.

Returned to

Santiago and apparently remained there until going to Carribean

to organize CORU.

This info suppressed at 76 sept trila of Otero- Otero found

innocent.

Otero had lived in FL until late December 1975 when he was told

by FBI informant that FBI was preparing to have him indicted on

bombing charges.

Otero then went to Dom Rep where he was

arrested and paroled. When Miami Fed Grand Jury reurned indictmen

against Otero, he flew to caracas where stayed with Morales. Info

move to arrest

alleges that Otero was told that if Venez. authorities

moved to arrest him, he could receive asylum with new Chilean

ambassador.

While in Cracas, Otero allegedly told Morales that

he had committed the bombings in Miami ans Morales passed this

information to the FBI.

Much of info on plot to kill Pascal and Brussier could have

come from Morales -- in FBi report. Morales was source

of numerous secret Service reports during Kissinger visit to

Caracas 2/76 on reprted attempt to kill Kissinger.
