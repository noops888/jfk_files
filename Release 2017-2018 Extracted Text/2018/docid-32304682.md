This investigation wag conducted to determine
if the subject is a member of1a Cosa, Nostra". Investiga-
tion, set out below, determined that the subject, a brother
of the deceased JOHNNY GUARIGLIA, does not exist.

_NY 3520-C (deceased) advised on 8/20/62, that "one
SAL/GUARIGLIA is a button for ODDO who handles the bookmaking
and sShylocking action along Avenue U. Informant stated that y
SAL is a brother of JOHNNY GUARIGLIA, who was killed in the
Hi-Fi Lounge last year. He noted that JOHNNY was also a
button.

Since the deceased informant was unavailable for Ee
reinterview and JOHNNY GUARIGLIA had a brother, PATSY
' GUARIGLIA, who fits the description in paragraph two above,
it 1s believed that the informant referred to PATSY in
August, 1962. A complete review of the informant's file
reflected only the above reference to SAL GUARIGLIA.

The records of the BCI, NYCPD, reviewed on 1/13/64,
by SA AUGUST J, MICEK, failed to reflect any record for
SAL GUARIGLIA.

The records of CIB, NYCPD, were reviewed by SA PATRICK
J. MOYNIHAN on 1/23/64, but there was no reference at all to
SAL GUARIGLIA. There are references to PATSY and JOHN
GUARIGLIA at this source.
