FROM

SUBJECT:

SALVATORE GUARIGLIA

DATE:

2/28/64

Investiga-

of the deceased JOHNNY GUARIGLIA, does not exist.

NY 3520-C (deceased) advised on 8/20/62, that "one

SAI, GUARIGLIA is a button for ODDO who handles the bookmaking

shylocking action along Avenue U. Informant stated that

SAL is a brother of JOHNNY GUARIGLIA, who was killed in the

Hi-Fi Lounge last year. He noted that JOHNNY was also a (

button.

Since the deceased informant was unavailable for

reinterview and JOHNNY GUARIGLIA had a brother, PATSY

GUARIGLIA, who fits the description in paragraph two above,

it is believed that the informant referred to PATSY in

August, 1962.

A complete review of the informant's file

reflected only the above reference to SAI GUARIGLIA.

The records of the BCI, NYCPD, reviewed on 1/13/64,

by SA AUGUST J. MICEK, failed to reflect any record for

SAL GUARIGLIA.

The records of CIB, NYCPD, were reviewed by SA PATRICK

J. MOYNIHAN on 1/23/04, but there

was no reference at all to

SAL GUARIGLIA. There are references to PATSY and JOHN

GUARIGLIA at this source.
