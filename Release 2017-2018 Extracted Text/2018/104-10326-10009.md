IN SUPPORT OF<JFK ASSASSINATION>REVIEW BOARD EFFORTS,

IS WILLING TO ATTEMPT RECONTACT OF (LITAMIL/9 (T/9) TO OBTAIN

INFORMATION REQUESTED REF A

HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT,

B PARA 3 IS IDENTICAL TO (T/9,)

HE IS AGING AND POSSIBLY EVEN

THE ONLY FEASIBLE LOCATION FOR RECONTACT WILL BE HIS

HOME, WHERE HE APPARENTLY LIVES WITH THE FEMALE WHO ANSWERED THE

PHONE DURING 26 MAR 98 PRETEXT CALL,

AND WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE

WILL BE ABLE TO MEET ALONE WITH HIM.

IN ADDITION,

BELIEVES THAT TO THOROUGHLY ANSWER ALL

OF REF A QUESTIONS, THE OFFICER CONDUCTING THE RECONTACT SHOULD

IDENTIFY HIMSELF AS A USG EMPLOYEE AND EXPLAIN THE VERY REAL

POSSIBILITY THAT (/9'S NAME WILL BE EXPOSED IN AN UPCOMING

*DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE<JFK ASSASSINATION. >

ASSUMING THAI TOROCKAWAY! COMMITTED ITSELF TO KEEPING IS S NAME AND

TOROCKAWAY RELATIONSHIP SECRET,

WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEAST WE CAN DO

IS ALLOW CZ TO PREPARE FOR POSSIBLE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC BY

ENGAGING IN A FRANK EXCHANGE ON CURRENT REVIEW BOARD PROCEEDINGS.

WHILE POSSIBLY UPSETTING TO (T/97 SUCH A DISCUSSION WOULD BEST ALLOW

US TO DETERMINE ANY NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS

PENSTON? AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES, POSSIBLY RESULTING FROM

EXPOSURE.

ALTHOUGH|

DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION

TO RESPOND TO REF A QUESTIONS,

WE SUSPECT THAT THE (CUBAN GOVERNMENT?

DOES NOT PROVIDE PENSIONS)TO EXPATRIATES. EVEN IF THIS WERE THE

SECRET

PER REF A QUERY REGARDING EFFECT OF (T./S EXPOSURE ON OTHER

JOPERATIONS, WE DO NOT LOOK FORWARD TO EXPLAINING TO ASSETS

CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS WHY THE NAME OF A FORMER--AND. STILL

LIVING- -TOROCKAWAY'ASSET WAS OFFICIALLY DECLASSIFIED BY THE USG, WHEN

MERE DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION ON ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THAT

UNDERSTAND THAT HQS IS SEARCHING FOR ADDITIONAL-P/9-SPECIFIC

ENFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST DECLASSIFICATION-OE

BROADER SCALE, IF C/S SJIDENTITY AND ROLE WERE TO PROMINENTLY APPEAR

PRESS SUBSEQUENTLY TO DECLASSIFICATION, AT THE LEAST

WE WOULD EXPECT A MODERATE EROSION IN OUR ASSETS' CONFIDENCE THAI

TOROCKAWAY IS ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITIES. AS WE EXPECT OUR-

ASSETS, TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP FROM THETI

OF THE EQUATION AND HAVE OFTEN MADE THIS A MATTER OF CONTENTION

WITH ASSETS, SOME AGENT HANDLING PROBLEMS COULD ENSUE WERE WE TO

APPEAR LESS THAN COMMITTED TO FULL PROTECTION OF THEIR IDENTITIES.

FUTURE AGENT ACQUISITIONS COULD ALSO BE COMPLICATED BY THE

DECLASSIFICATION OF I/S'S NAME, AS C/O'S WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK

THAT MUCH HARDER TO CONVINCE

THAT WE CAN PROTECT THEIR

IDENTITY-FROM THE TYPICALLY ANTI-AMERICAN-LOCAL PRESS.-

REQUEST HOS COMMENT REGARDING NEED FOR RECONTACT OF LI/S AND

REQUEST FILE REVIEW SO THAT WE WILL BE IN A FIRM POSITION FROM WHICH

ALTHOUGH (I/9) MAY NOT RECALL DETAILS OF ANY RECONTACT

PLAN AFTER THE CONSIDERABLE TIME ELAPSED SINCE WORKING AS AN AGENT,

PLEASE PROVIDE ANY DETAILS (I.E. CALIAS OF LASI HANDLING C/OT WHICH
