Mr. JONES advised that Suite 2003 at the Hotel
St, Moritz was rented on a long-term basis by a garment
manufacturer, one LEO MORRIS, who is connected with the
furrier firm of Morris, Suskind and Reich, 23 West 30th
Street, New York City. Mr. JONES advised that top
hoodlum BENSY LEVINE and Fontainebleau Hotel owner BEN
NOVAK and NOVAK's sister, own Laurels City Club, Sackett
Lake, New York, which is a well known New York summer resort..

In regard to VINCENT ALO, Mr. JONES advised that
on September 12, 1956, VINCENT ALO, MEYER LANSKY and Mayor
GROGAN, of Jersey City, New Jersey, met in a suite on the
twelfth floor of the Hotel 1n, New York City.
According to Mr. JONES, MARI, AMER, owner_of the Hotel | Me
Lincoln, igs a close friend of the well known hoodlum, OWNEY
‘MADDEN. MADDEN stays at the Hotel Lincoln when in New Yorr.”

mob contact, and that when VINCENT ALO visits the Hotel
Lincoln, he shakes. hands with the manager, giving him a
$100 bill. .

NY 14y9-C advised in regard to the racket sét-up /
in the garment area that 2 gangs control all criminal _
activities in these areas. He stated that one of these y
gangs, which is headed by VITO GENOVESE, cofitrols the
Italian element in thése areas. The other gang consists ~
of the control of the Jewish element which is controlled
by MSYER LANSKY. The informant stated VITO GENOVESE is the
biggest Hoodlum in the United States today, and that only
one man-is stronger than GENOVESE in the United States,
and that man is FLMHETTI of Chicago, Illinois, He stated
that because of the vast power that GENOVESE presently
holds in the United States, he cannot adequately place
too much control in one area. Hence, his control in .
the garment area of New York City is rather loose, and
the Jewish Gangs apparently at the present time, have a
stricter enforcement code to control this specific area.

The informant furnished the following information
concerning the control in the garment area by the Jewish
Gangs:

He stated that MEYER LANSKY is presently the
top man in this area, He continued that LANSKY recently

CARFANO's operations. NY

{ According to the records of the New York
City Police Department, ANTHONY CARFANO, with aliases; was
born in New York City on November 11, 1695. However,
the national list of the F.B.N, lists CARFANO as having
been born in New York City in 1898.

New York Informant 169-C advised on July 20, 1956,
4 that he heard that CARFANO is spending the summer in or i
near Long Beach, Long Island, New York, and 1s supposed to
be behind a large crap game, either in session or proposed
for that area. ;

1956, stated:

"LITTLE AUGIE PISANO insisted on a secret
rendezvous yesterday, with New Jersey Police, before he
would agree to questioning in the attempted assassination
of LOUIS SAPERSTEIN, on Saturday, in Newark.

| "PISANO and his lawyer, HAROLD CORBIN, met

| Newark Police Lieutenant JOSEPH KINNEY and four other officers
somewhere in Manhattan, and told them he did not know anything
about the attempted killing of SAPERSTEIN, former insurance —

"Identified by SAPERSTEIN as a man to whom he paid
kickbacks in a union fund racket, PISANO said, that he had not
been. in Newark in three years. PISANO also had been indicted
for bribery, in New York County Jail, on SAPERSTEIN's testimony,
but the indictment was dismissed on a technicality.

Potential Criminal Informant JACK MARRAFFA, on
August 24, 1956, identified bankrollers of Italian lottery
in the United States as JOE ADONIS; VITO GENOVESE, and

There are two other gambling casinos operating
4n Cuba at the present time. One is located at the Varadere
International Hotel at Varadere Beach, Cuba, which is located
approximately 80 miles east of Havana. The other gambling
easino is located in Santiago de Cuba at the Casa Grande Hotel.
The city of Santiago de Cuba is located in the eastern part
of the island of Cuba and is approximately 700 miles from
Havana.

With reference to the possibility that gambling
in Guba is controlled by a syndicate headed by MEYER LANSKY or
other individuals, it is noted that DINO CELLINI, who has
operated the gambling casino at the Tropicana for many years,
is also running the gambling casino at Oriental Park Race Track,
His brother, EDDIE CELLINI, has been placed in the casino at
the Hotel Nacional as a floor man in the gambling room. Also,
information has been received from Lt. HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ
of the Cuban National Police that the license for operating
in the gambling casino at the Sans Souci had been issued by
the Cuban Government to OSCAR He BCHEMENDARIA, who is an associate
and director of the Topicana Night Club. It appears likely,
therefore, that there is some sort of tie-in between at least
four of Havana's gambling casinos. This matter 1s being followéad,
and the Bureau will be kept advised.

NY 1449¢ advised from March 15, 1956, to March

31, 1956, that at the present time, two gangs control all /
criminal activities in the Garment Area. He said one of
these gangs which is headed by VITO GENOVESE controls the
Italian element in this area. The other gang consists of /
the Jewish element which is controlled by MEYER LANSKY.- ¢
The informant stated VITO GENOVESE is one of the biggest /

~ hoodlums in the United States, and that aniy..one man is v
stronger than GENOVESE in the United States, and that man is
FISCHETTI of Chicago, Illinois. He stated that because of the \
vast power that GENOVESE presently holds in the United States, he
cannot adequately place too much control in one area. Hence,
his control in the Garment Area of New York City is rather loose,
and the Jewish Gangs apparently at the present time, have a
stricter enforcement code to control this specific area.

Criminal control in the garment district is
the subject of a pending investigation in the New
York Office under the caption Garment - Trucking

controlled ‘all criminal activities in the garment
area of New York City. He stated that one of these
gangs, which 1s headed by VITO GENOVESE, comprises. the

informant stated VITO GENOVESE is the biggest hoodlum
in the United States today, and that only one man is

man is FICHETTI of Chicago, Illinois. He stated that
because of the vast power that GENOVESE
presently holds. in the United States, he cannot adequately
place too much contol in one area. Hence, his control
in the Garment Area of New York City is rather loose,

have a stricter enforcement code to control this
specific area.

During the course of this discussion with
the informant, the informant furnished the following
information concerning the control in the Garment Area
by the Jewish Gangs:

He stated that MEYER LANSKY is presently
