A U.S. Department of State press release was issued
identifying NOSENKU as KGS officer and acxnowledging his
request for political asylum in the United States.

pas - Because of his

long tenure in the KGB, KOSLNKO would have a great deal of
important information which he could impart to intelligence
agencies of otier countries. Certainty, he would be
acquainted with many KGB employees and could identify them.
He alse would be intimately acquainted with a large number
of Soviet agents working inside the USSR againat American
and British nationals.

According to a tlcigibditaldes Secures

The bulk of NOSENKO's unowledge concerning
KGB activitfes would revolve around the intelligence
operations of the KGB in Moscow and also KGB personalities
working in Headquarters. NOSENKO was also undoubtedly
familiar vith all KCB personalities in Geneva and certainly
knew some KGB personalities in other countries.

Comment: NOSENKO identified a number of KGB officers in
Geneva; he asserted that some othere,..known
by CIA to be connected with the KGB, were not.

* GOLITSYN (from personal acquaintance): NOSENKO, the son
of the former Minister of Shipbuilding, vas a KGB officer
who had worked in the American Department and the Seventh
Department of the Second Chief Directorate. GOLITSYN, while
on his own First Chief Directorate budiness, met NOSENKO two.
or three times in the American Em y Section in 1953,
and had seen hin occasionally at work during 1958 and 1959.
When GOLITSYN asked him where he was working in 1959, NOSENKO
replied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department.

“NOSENKO served in the American Embassy Section from 1953
until 1957 or 1958, and was specifically responsible for
KGB coverage of American military personnel in Moscow during
1953. For the. remainder of hie service in the Emb,
until 1957 or 1958, NOSENKO may have had the same r.
‘bilities or may have been working against other Embassy
Personnel or correspondents, but he vas definitely in the
‘American Departnent during the entire period. In 1957 or
1958 NOSENKO was transferred to the Seventh Department, and
was a senior case officer there as of 1959. NOSENKO did not

“work in the Arerican Department of the Second Chief Directorate

American Department at any time during 1960; GOLITSYN visited

the Embassy Section on at least. three occasions from early

1960 to early 1961, and would have known if NOSENKO had been
