Office of the Director

John F. Pereira

C/Historical Review Group/CSI

JFK Assassination Records

Per your request, attached are the two documents

referred to in the JFK Assassination Board's letter to

the Director of 31 July 1995. The sole remaining issue

concerned the release of the cryptonym "LIENVOY". All

other issues have been resolved.

We are discussing with

the Do the question of whether to appeal. In my view, we

are unlikely to appeal.
