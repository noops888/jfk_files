HEKLAR
ESPIONAGE - RUSSIA

Heklar is code name for a Soviet illegal agent
using the identity of Helmuth Felix Klawuhn.

Through the Socap Program (screening of new

Social Security applicants in Baltimore) the Social
Security application of Klawuhn dated May 2, 1960, was
located, He gave his birth date as January 29, 1925, in
Detroit, Michigan, and residence as 315 West 94th Street,
New York City. A preliminary check verified Klawuhn's
birth in Detroit to German alien parents and there were
no traces of this family after 1933 which suggested they
had returned to Germany. It was determined that Klawuhn
was born a cripple with a hip disease and would probably
have the appearance as walking like a "duck" all his life.
State Department records revealed the Klawuhn brothers
were taken to Germany by their mother in May,-1932.
Specimens of the handwriting of Helmuth and Horst Klawuhn
appearing in State Department files were compared with

: subject's handwriting by the FBI Laboratory and found not

i to be identical.

It was determined subject's first known
presence in New York was July 8, 1959, when he rented a
room on the West side of New York. He was employed as
a salesman by Service Guidance Corporation and was
observed not to walk like a cripple.

Information developed through an anonymous
source revealed that the subject was in the possession
of a Hallicrafter short-wave radio receiver with ear-
phones and a long coil antenna concealed in a foot locker,
He also had a black portable typewriter, various types of
pills, pads of writing paper and several books on grammar.

FBI Laboratory determined one of the pills was
a "phony" and closely resembled other tablets which have
been used aS developers for secret ink messages in Soviet
espionage operations.

It was concluded that the subject was an impostor
and based on the information developed through the anonymous
source and the knowledge gained in the Karot case, it was
believed reasonable to conclude that the subject was a Soviet
illegal. Karot was a Soviet illegal interviewed in March,
1959, who cooperated with us as a double agent.

Subject was interviewed from October 18, 1960,
through October 31, 1960, under secure conditions and was
permitted to return to his residence in New York City on
October 31, 1960. Subject furnished information as to his
true status as a Soviet illegal and furnished complete
details regarding his selection, training and dispatch to
the U. S. and agreed to cooperate fully to the extent of
disclosing all available information concerning his knowledge
of Soviet espionage activities. In January, 1961, subject
disappeared after being in contact with Special Agents of the
FBI since October 31, 1960.

Above caption is the code name for this case which

an individual using the name of Helmuth Felix Klawuhn who, we are
reasonably certain, is a Soviet illegal agent. This memorandum is
to consider our future course of action. :

Origin of C

Through our Socap Program (screening of new social security
applications in Baltimore) the social security application of Klawihn
dated 5/2/60 was located. He gave his birth as 1/29/25, Detroit,
Michigan, and his residence as 315 West 94th Street, NvC. His hand-
writing contained foreign characteristics. A preliminary check
verified Klawuhn's birth in Detroit to German alien parents. There
was no trace of this family after 1933, suggesting the possibility
they had returned to their native Germany.

| information Developed on the True Helmuth Felix Klawihn

The Detroit Office determined that Klawuwhn was born a
cripple with a hip disease and would probably have the deformity
of walking “like a duck" all his life. He had a younger brother,
Horst Albert, born 5/23/30, Detroit.

State Department records reveal that the Klawuhn brothers
were taken to Germany by their mother in May, 1932. Their father /
followed them the following year. In March, 1947, the American
Military Government in Berlin received a letter in the German /
language from a Helmuth Klawuhn residing at Parchim, Mecklenburg}
Germany, advising of the birth of himself and his brother, Horst,
in Detroit in 1925 and 1930, respectively, and their trip to Germany
in 1932, The writer wanted to know whether he and his brother were
still considered as U. S. citizens and whether they would be permitted
to immigrate to the U. 5S. The letter was referred to the American

citizenship was established. His application listed his brother,
Helmuth, as then residing in Germany. State Department records fail
to reveal that Heimith or Horst ever took subsequent steps to validate
their claim to U. 5. citizenship or repatriate themselves to the U. S.

Specimens of the handwriting of Helmuth and Horst Klawuhn
appearing in State Department files have been compared with subject's
Ererthte by the FBI Laboratory. Subject's handwriting is not
identical with these specimens.

Information Developed on the Subi

The New York Office (NYO) determined that subject's first
known presence in New York was 7/8/59 when he rented a room on
New York's west side. He has been at his present address since
7/3/60. He is employed as a salesman by Service Guidance Corp.,
jobbers of household services. He does not walk like a cripple.

Information developed through an anonymous source reveals
that subject is in possession of a Hallicrafter short-wave radio
receiver with earphones and a long coil antenna concealed in a
locked foot locker. He also has a black portable typewriter,
various types of pills, pads of writing paper, several books on
grammar.

The FBI Laboratory determined that one of the pills made
to resemble "Creamalin" tablet, a common antacid preparation sold
in drugstores, is a "phony" and closely resembles other tablets
which have been used as developers for secret ink messages in Soviet
espionage operations.

At the present time NYO is maintaining most discreet
coverage of subject through an observation post, spot check
surveillances and mail coverage, His only activity, other than
his employment, is dating an Irish immigrant waitress, Rose McKinley,
who appears to have been a "pickup." She spends many nights and
weekends with him.

Analysis.

_ ., It is believed we can safely conclude that from the infor.
tiation known. .concerning.the-Klawuhn—family,-subject—is an impostor.-—
Further, from information developed through the anonymous source and
from our knowledge gained in the Karot case, it is believed reasonable
to conclude that subject is in the U. S. as a Soviet illegal agent.

Course of Action

We have carefully analyzed all aspects of this case and
considered various possible courses of action. As can be seen, we
do not have sufficient legal evidence for a prosecutive case.
Whether admissible legai evidence can be developed in the future

’ in light of the clandestine nature of Soviet illegal operations
appears unlikely. From what we have learned in the Karet case, we
consider. it extremely doubtful that surveillances and other investi-

ative techniques would produce anything of value. even if continued
or an.extended period of time. There is always the possibility

_ that an extended investigation would alert the subject and he would .
disappear, and we will have gained nothing.

We, therefore, feel that the best course of action is a
most thorough interview, similar to that conducted in March, 1959,
in Wisconsin during which we developed the Karot subject as a double
agent. It is recognized that subiect may be difficuit to hreak
since he has been in the J. S. at least 14 months and probably longer.
Karot was in the U. S. for about two months when we approached him.
. Despite the uncertainty as to success, we believe the ultimate
. possible gain is worth the attempt. If we are unsuccessful, we
will have at least neutralized hin. :

We also feel that_if we are to interview the subject, it
should be done very soon. If dclayed, his relations with the Irish
.., Waitress may develop to the point that would cause us additional
problems in our efforts to handle our approach to him in a most:~
discreet and unobtrusive manner. : : - Be
NYO has advised tlat it has a suitable location for use
in a most thorough interview of subject.

ACTION:

If you approve, we will plan to make our approach to the
subject during the week of October 17, 1960. Also, if you: 2pprove,
Inspector D. E. Moore will go to New York and with New York Agents
conduct the interview of the subject. 7

pregnant, and on her arrival in the US his parents were ;
married here. He had no brothers or sisters. While in the D> aie

US his father was employed as a cabinet maker, salesman

and clerk. They resided in Detroit, Michigan, at an unrecalled
address and returned to Germany together at an unrecalled
gate, but he believed that at this time he was about two or
three years of age. After returning to Germany at some
unknown time his parents separated for personal reasons. His
father then returned to the US but he did not know how or when.
He remained in Germany with his mother.

At this time his mother was a singer and musician
and utilized these occupations as a means of support: for both
herself and him. At this time they travelled quite a bit all
over Germany and they also travelled in France and Belgium.

He stated that he definitely remembered being in France
because he noticed that they spoke a different language when
they crossed the border He also recalled staying in a hotel
in Paris and remembered living in Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich,
Germany, in thatcrier. He could not recall the dates or
residences in any of the above-mentioned places.

He stated that he remembered going to school in
Munich, Germany, and at this time he was in the fifth or
sixth grades, and this was the first time that he actually
remembered experiencing anti-Semitism in Germany. He
remembered that Aryan appearing beys 1.e. blond.haired, sat up
in the front of the classroom and they were allowed to "join
the "junior brownshirts". He stated that et this time he
never participated in this type of activity due to his Semitic
. background. He could not recall the name or the location of
this school which he attended in Munich, but he remembered that
it was about four to five blocks away from two night clubs
where his mother entertained. He stated that at this time
of his life his mother did not. accompany him to school as was
normal in the parent-child relationship because she was Semiti¢é
looking. Instead of his mother she would have various friends
of eae accompany him to school to remove any possible stigma

With regard to his mother's occupation he stated
that she was mainly a singer, but she was also a musician.
When he got older he used to accompany her on the piano when
she was appearing in night clubs. At this time, she used her
maiden name for professional reasons. The subject later
changed this statement to the fact that she used a "nickname"
like"VON SONNENBERG", but stated that she always used CLARA
as her first name.

He advised that he had no formal education and he
only went as high as the sixth grade and never remained for any
length of. time at any one school due to his mother's travelling.
He stated that the school in Munich which he attended for about
two years was the longest time that he was ever at one school.
He advised that he had no schooling whatsoever in English and
that he has learned English since he arrived in the US.

While in Germany, he never belonged to the Nazi
Party and constantly stated that he could recall very easily
how hard and difficult everything was in life for him. He
advised that he remembered his mother and Jewish friends
speaking in Yiddish in hushed tones in a manner so that he
could not overhear the terrible things that were happening to
the Jewish people at this time, He advised that he understood
Yiddish from being brought up in this atmosphere but was not
fluent in it.

Sometime prior to the beginning of World War II
or in 1940, he and his mother left Germany and fled to
Switzerland. They travelled to Switzerland by train but he did

- not recall anything concerning dates or places connected

with this travel. He stated that he did recall, however, that
they proceeded directly from Munich, Germany +0 Basel,
Switzerland, and later, from Bas¢l to Zurich, Switzerland.

they wereliving with a Jewish woman who resided four or five
blocks from Prospect Park. They remained here about two to
three months while living in Brooklyn. His mother also worked

which ran from a railroad station to the center of town.

It was in Boston about i949 or 1950, that his
mother decided to return to Germany. She parted from him
in Boston and he does not know where she went to in Germany and
never heard from her again. He assumed that she died
some time after departing in 1949 or 1950.

Upon leaving Boston, his mother left him four or
five hundred dollars when she departed. He only worked
occasionally in Boston as a pianist accompanying singers. He
could not recall where he lived, the names of any of the

particular area because it contained a lot of foreigner
and he felt that he would stand the best chance of locating his
father in this particular section. He advised that the way
he went about locating his father,since he did not know his
address, was to stop people in the street and ask them if they
knew of his father,mentioning his name. He also went in to
many bars and queried both the patrons and the bartenders
in thissame fashion. He recalled that while in Detroit he
stayed at a residential hotel which cost about a dollar a day.

“With regard to the subject serving in the Armed
Forces of the United States since his arrival here, he stated
that although he registered for the Draft, he was not accepted
for service because he had flat feet. When he was advised
that flat feet would not keep one from serving in the Armed
Forees, he stated there was something else that the
doctors had found out that was wrong with him but they did
not tell him what it was and he did not know what it was. He
stated he‘believed also that he was kept out of the
service because/t. e time he took his physical examination,
he could not speak English and because of his lack of
Ikmowledge of the English language, he was not taken into the
Armed Forces. When advised that lack of knowledge of the
English language does not keep you out, but on the contrary,
special schools are run in the Armed Forces after
inducticn and this could not possibly be a reason for
non service, he stated he did not know why they did
not want him but they never got around to calling him into
the service and that he was classified as being physically
unfit. When asked why he received a 5A classification instead
of a 4F classification, he advised that the man who typed his
ecard at the Draft Board probably made a mistake in classi-
fying him. He advised that he knew that the term 4F applied
to persons who were rejected from military service for
physical reasons and he believed that was what he should
have been classified. :

He could not account for registering under one
Selective Service Act and being classified under another
Selective Service Act. He stated he did not register for
the Selective Service Act of 1948, did not serve in the
Armed Forces in the Korean War and could give no reason for
not registering under this Act.

With regard to certain of the contents of his
wallet, the subject advised as follows.

“ With regard to the package of $20 bills amounting
to $1920, he stated he saved this up over the years

and kept on adding to it. He tied it with a thread and
wrapped it in brown paper because it was neater. He stated
i he saved only $20 bills because he liked them and they
were less bulky than $5 or $10 bills. He stated he
imew there was exactly $1920 in this package, He would not
say when he first used brown paper to wrap the money but
stated he used’ many wrappers and they wore out over a period
of time.

With regard to the lease for his present apartment,
he stated the name, IRVING RUBEN, written on it,is an
individual working in Professional Detail Service and
the phone number appearing after it is RUBEN'’s phone number. He
stated the telephone number TR 4-9213 was the telephone
number of the building he presently resides in.

With regard to the registration card from Local
Board number 161, he claimed that the address shown, namely,
211 Clinton Street, Brooklyn, New York, was his address at
that time and that he registered right after coming to the _
United States but upon reflection, stated it could have beer,
two years after he came to the United States. cea

With regard to the Notice of Classification, he
stated this was mailed to him at the same address on
Clinton Street and, although he had not lived there for
four years, a friend received this card and gave it to him
but he does not wish to say who this friend is.

With regard to the receipts for radios purchased
at the Grand Central Radio Shop, he stated he originally
bought a Hallicrafters Radio to listen to radio messages from
satellites in orbit around the earth. He traded this radio
in at a later date and at this time, got a better radio. He

because if he turned a speaker up, it would disturb the
neighbors next door and also after certain hours, you
eannot turn on a radio in furnished rooms. He stated

he listened to broadcasts from San Francisco, Chicago, and
foreign broadcasts from Germany, Switzerland, England,
France and Brazil.

With regard to the school certificate from the
University of London, he stated "Let me say something first.
That is a phony." He stated he bought it about five years
ago and used it to get a steady job. He would not state
where he bought it or from whom or anything else connected
with it and would not state where he utilized this certificate
to get a job.

With regard to the certificate of birth registration,
he stated “This is my birth certificate. My mother gave me
this in Switzerland before we applied at the United States
Consulate in 1945." :

| FINAL STORY OF HIS TRUE BACKGROUND

Subject subsequently changed his story as to his
background but stated he would not furnish details concerning
his father and mother and his personal. life.

| He said, however, that his father was a German and
his mother a Jew and that he had been born in the United States.
He declined to say exactly when he left the United States but
indicated it was at an early age. He said his father and
mother separated while he was quite young and he lived with

his mother. She used her maiden name and he was also known

by this name.

According to him, his father became a prominent
Nazi and served in HITLER's army. He indicated that_“is father

may have been a scientist and had something to do with
scientific developments. He stated that while his father
and mother separated, his father never remarried and did

not live with any mistress, His father secretly met with his
mother under ‘clandestine circumstances on many occasions

and the subject, on some occasions, went to Berlin with his
mother to meet with his father.

According to the subject, this marriage was
apparently never known to Nagi officials and did not prevent
his father from being accepted as a true Nazi. He stated
that his father frequently sent money and gifts to his
mother and himself. Subject claims to not know whether
his father is dead or not but said he has heard nothing
definite about his father since World War II,

Subject claims to have led an extremely difficult
life and said that he has been persecuted and taken advantage
of from as early as he could remember. He said that he
has always lived with his mother and that most of his life
was in Germany. He stated that he has spoken English since
@ child, that both his mother and father spoke English and
that in addition to speaking English with them, he has also
been accustomed to using the English language in talking to
various friends of his mother, He indicated that he had,
at one time, been in England, probably with his parents, or
at least with his mother.

Subject indicated that he and his mother had, at
one time, been in a displaced persons camp but he would not

‘say in what country or indicate the camp. He did say that

he and his mother had attempted to gain admittance to the
United States and indicated this attempt may have been made
while in the displaced persons camp.

Subject indicated that up until early 1959, he had
been residing wy with his. mother. in od elty. in. East. _Germenys *



NY 65-18217

would not name the city but said it was not East Berlin.
He said he was employed as a music teacher and resided in
an apartment with his mother.

Subject refused to give any details of his
personal history and stated that he did not, at this time,
want to furnish any information which would identify his
mother or father. He indicated that his father had held
such @ position in the Nazi government that his name would
be Imown to us. He also indicated that because of certain
acts of his father, he was afraid that this would have a
detrimental effect on the possibility of the subject himself
ever being allowed to remain in the United States.

FINAL STORY AS TO RECRUITMENT, INTELLIGENCE
TRAINING AND ASSIGNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES

Recruitment

In about July, 1958, subject was residing with
his mother in a city in East Germany. He was employed as
@ piano instructor at a music school and also gave private
lessons. The music schools in East Germany are under the ~-
direction and control of the Ministry of Culture of the _/
East German Government. Part of his duties entailed -
attending political and "workers" meetings. He and other
instructors at the music school would furnish musical
entertainment which was used to entice people to the
meetings. While at the music school, he was accosted
by a man who identified himself as MY“KUEHN, who addressed
subject by his name and questioned him abdut his work at the
school, KUEHN appeared to be familiar with the personnel
and school activities generally. Subject formed the opinion
that KUEHN was either a superintendent of the school or an

official of the Cultural Ministry of the East German Govern-_

ment. The conversation between KUEHN and thé. subject. wa:

< _
NW 55060 DocId:32989537 Page 21 7



e

NY 65-18217

held in the school building and KUEHN suggested that they
meet again at a later date. Subject agreed and suggested

‘that the meeting be held at his, subject's, apartment. He

described KUEHN as being 40 years of age, six feet, one inch,
tall, bony structure, light brown hair, light eyes with no
other distinguishing marks. Subject stated that KUEHN was

a very cultured and well-educated person who spoke "hoch"

or high German. He believed that KUEHN was possibly a
Berliner. KUEHN could read English but was unable to speak it.

After the meeting that was held at subject's
apartment, KUEHN scheduled a third meeting at his apartment.
KUEHN accompanied subject to the house and escorted him
into the apartment house through the rear door. Subject
said that the apartment house was four stories high and con-
tained approximately 34 apartments. The apartment to which
he was escorted was on the third floor in a wing of the
building. The apartment consisted of a large parlor on either
side of which were two separate units. Each unit consisted
of a bedroom and living room. Subject was escorted to the
bedroom and living room on the left hand side of the parlor
as he entered. The kitchen and toilet facilities were
adjacent to the apartment on the right hand side.

KUEHN suggested a fourth meeting with the subject
which was to be held at a restaurant. He invited subject to
dinner and subject assumed that he would pay the check.

Upon arrival at the restaurant, KUEHN pointed out a man

. whom subject described as either American or English looking

and who was quite dapperly dressed, sitting alone at another
table in the restaurant. KUEHN suggested to the subject
that he address him and offer assistance. In view of
his American appearance, he suggested the possibility that
the man was unable to order properly. Subject advised that
he objected on the grounds that he did not know the man,

Nw 55080 DocId:32989537 Page 22



NY. 65-18217

However, KUEHN insisted and thereupon subject addressed
this unknown man. The man pretended to be delighted to
find somebody with whom he could converse in English and

. ’at KUEHN's suggestion, subject invited this unknown man
to their table. The man questioned subject closely regarding
the books in the English language that he had read and his
education in English. Subject stated that he, upon reflection,
decided that this man was in the restaurant by prearrangement
with KUEHN for the sole purpose of testing subject's English.
He deduced this from the questions he was asked by this unknown
man concerning his background in English studies and literature.

Subject recalled that KUEHN ordered a bottle of
wine with the dinner and the subject was quite surprised at
the termination of the meal when KUEHN allowed subject to
pay the check. Subject advised that he had made the offer
out of courtesy. Upon leaving the restaurant, KUEHN advised
subject that he did not want to argue with the subject over
the check while in the restaurant and placed a sum of money
in subject's pocket. Subject stated that upon his arrival
at home, he found that the money given to him by KUEHN was
300 East German marks. The check in the restaurant had been
merely 60 East German marks. :

Subject had a series of four more meetings with
KUEHN at which they discussed politics and geography. At
the eighth meeting, which was approximately two months after
his initial introduction to KUEHN,while talking in KUEHN's
’ apartment, KUEHN said to the subject "I came across a name
which will be interesting to you." He thereupon mentioned
the subject's father's name. Subject advised that because
his father had failed to notify the Nazi government that he
was married to a Jewess it would be detrimental to -
his father should it be known.His mother and he,so far as he
knew,were the only ones who knew of the marriage. The ety

revelation by KUEHN took subject so by surprise that he
immediately began discussing his father's career and |
relationship to him and his mother. Subject stated that
he was afraid for himself and for his mother believing that

* yveprisals. would be taken against them because of his father's
prominence as a Nazi. After revealing to KUEHN all the
details of his father's relationship with his mother,
KUEHN assured him that he would not use the information
which subject had given to him and facts he knew about
subject's father to the detriment of either subject or
his mother. Upon reflection, subject felt that KUEHN
actually did not know as much about his father as subject
had related and he felt later that he had been tricked into
revealing too much. He said, however, that his purpose was
to try to show that he had actually had very little to do
with his father and that he had always lived with his mother.

Subject advised that his education and indoctrination
eontinued with KUEHN for about two more months, the meetings
being held in KUEHN's apartment.

KUEHN began his educational course with geographical
albums on the Soviet Government. ‘These albums contained
information on the progress that the Soviet Government has
made since the Soviet Revolution. The albums contained
photographs of cities, buildings, factories and important
landmarks of the Soviet Union. Underneath the photographs
were descriptions citing the production figures of the
factory or the political or social significance of the
photographed place. The second album introduced by KUEHN
was on the Socialist Camp. This consisted, according to
subject, of photographs of cities and places of countries
that are affiliated with the Soviet Union, such as Czecho-
slovakia, Bulgaria, etc. These albums also contained figures
and charts and a description of the progress that has been
made by these countries since they adopted a Communist

Government. Subject was required to memorize the facts and
figures which were supplied in these albums and he was
questioned on them by KUEHN, He was also given record
albums containing the national music of various countries
and specifically of the Soviet Union. Subject had a good musi-
eal background and was aware of many of the more prominent
composers throughout Europe but was not especially familiar
with various Soviet artists. Because of this, much of the
material concerned Soviet music and composers. Subject

was also furnished with material which identified and gave
the background of leading Communist figures. He said he
became familiar with the background of most of the leading
figures in the Soviet Union. In describing various charts
furnished subject, he said they were "beautifully done." He
Said many were in color and very effectively portrayed the -
advancement which has been made in the Soviet Union. He
recalled specifically a chart comparing illiteracy at the
time of the revolution with the present time and stated that
the chart dealing with this stated that over 90% of the
people were illiterate, and at the present time well under
10% are illiterate. The albums, brochures, and charts were
in the German language.

' Graining in Radio Reception

: Subject advised that after approximately four
months association with KUEHN he went to the apartment PEEEEE
and was introduced by KUEHN to a Mr.“SCHILLER, SCHILLER . : t
made a joking remark to the subject impiying that the boo ery
apartment was not KUEHN's, but was in fact SCHILL=R's.
Subject describes SCHILLER as being approximately 47
years old, dark hair, dark complexion, about 5! tol tail, 7 7
and rather chubby, The only distinguishing feature be
subject could recall was that SCHILLER had a recessed .
bridge to his nose, He advised that SCHILLER spoke
German with either a Mecklenburg or part Polish accent.
He advised that SCHILLER was not as cultured as KUEHN,
but appeared to have a very wide technical knowledge,

—

Subject stated that SCHILLER was an engineer or

technician. He questioned the subject on his knowledge
of radio operation and construction. After questioning
subject, SCHILLER told him that he knew nothing about
radio and proceeded to give him instructions, SCHILLER
also furnished subject manuals on radio construction and
operation. He went into complete details on the
functional parts of radio. At the completion of the
technical aspects of the radio construction, subject
was required to locate various frequencies on the radio
to display his ability to locate low wave length broadcasts,
One of the stations which subject was required to locate
eontained a broadcast by a man who recited five digit
numbers with a slight pause after each grouping.
Subject had no training in ciphers or code at this time,
but was merely required to copy down the numbers as
‘recited by the broadcaster, Subject state

Instruction in Espionage Technique

After the completion of the radio course,
the subject was furnished books which were case
histories on espionage activity by German, English, and
other agents during and prior to World War II, He
recalled that the first book that was furnished to him
by SCHILLER was"Fhe Espionage Activities of T, E. Lawrence",
a British Intelligence agent, With this book and the other
7 books which subject was required to read, he received a
supplement for each book, which he was told to guard
earefully as they were considered highly confidential
by his instructors, These supplements consisted of a
series of questions on the errors that were committed
by the espionage agent. The supplement made reference
by page to the espionage book, SCHILLER discussed in
detail the techniques used by the espionage agent, the
errors the agent made, and also the particularly fine
accomplishments which he might have made, Subject was
questioned in detail regarding the errors and advantages
of various espionage techniques. Subject stated that
at about this time he gathered that he was being
groomed by SCHILLER for activity outside the East German
Government. Heretofore,under the training of KUEHN and
SCHILLER, he believed that he was being groomed for use
within the East German Government itself,

After the completion of the course on espionage
techniques, subject told SCHILLER that if he was being
groomed to work in the West Berlin sector or the Western
Zone of Germany, he would not accept such an assignment.
He said he did this because he was continually reading
about East German agents who were apprehended by West

German authorities, Subject advised the books on espionage
eases were for the most part in the English language. He

Training in the Use of Secret Writing

i“ Subject stated that after the completion of
his studies on espionage techniques and the errors
committed by espionage agents, he was then introduced
into the use of preparing | secret writing by SCHILLER,

In this connection, SCHILLER told subject. that
he could prepare an open text letter whichwuld appear
entirely innocuous, ‘Thereafter, SCHILLER showed subject
how to use special paper and this was done in the
following manner, After an open text letter was prepared,
using either pencil, pen, or a typewriter, the open text
letter was placed over a special sheet of transfer paper.
Subject described this as a chemically treated paper which
eould be used to transfer invisible messages to another
sheet. SCHILLER taught subject to place the transfer
paper on a table and according to subject, any hard surface
was satisfactory. He said it could be done on glass,
marble, or wood, and in fact the wood surface did not have
to be especially hard.

He said that in placing the open text letter on
the transfer paper you could write on either the side on
which writing appeared or on the back, or on both, He
said that he was taught to use a rounded instrument with
no sharp edges and said that a plece of wood could be
used, but he, himself, customarily used the reverse end of

-a ball point pen and he demonstrated with a ball point

pen, which had a fairly fine end , but was not sharp.

He said that the letters or numbers could be written

right over the handwriting or typewriting, but they

had to be larger and he indicated a size almost one half inch
high, It was noted, however, that in demonstrating this
writing his actual letters and numbers did not appear

©

NW 55080 Docld:32989537 Page 28



ae

NY 65418217

In the secret writing it did not matter where
he started on the page and there was no necessity to have
any breaks in the writing for folding the letter. He
said, however, that because of subsequent handling, it was
not desirable to write near the edge either at the top
or bottom or on the sides. In describing the pressure
exerted he said that a moderate amount was used to insure
the transfer, but nevertheless you should not press too
hard as the indentations left should be light enough that
they could be removed. He said that the transfer paper
furnished him was in tablet form and all of the paper in
the tablet was transfer paper as far as he knew. He
said he was quite sure this was so as they did no& tell
him to use anky a certain portion of the tablet. He
said they also told him that he could use each sheet of
transfer paper approximately five times, either side, but
that he yliormally only used the transfer paper once and then
destroyed it.

He said that he did not know anything about the
composition of the transfer paper other than that it was
specially treated. With regard to the paper to be used
for. the open text letter he said that any paper that was
not too rough or porous could be used. He ‘said they
showed him some lined paper which they did not consider
desirable as the lines would interfere with reading some of
the secret writing.

He said that there was no instruction given him

as to folding the paper, as to the type of envelope to
be used, or as to the number of sheets which could be

used in any letter. He said he presumed as many sheets
as necessary could be used and this would not affect

their ultimate readability. He said they did tell him
not to handle the special paper too much as it might .- 7

NY 65-18217

Subject advised that for purposes of security
when a sheet of the transfer paper had been used, rather

than put it back in the pad where it might be detected,

subject was instructed that he could crumble the sheet
and lay it aside casually where its significance would
not be detected by any searcher, He advised that he

was instructed’that when he again desired to use the
paper he was not to smooth the crumpled sheet by pressing
it with his hand, but rather he was to take the sides

of the paper and stretch the paper back into shape.

Development of Secret Writing

After subject practiced writing open text
letters and then preparing a secrev message on the
letter, he was given instructions in developing
the secret writing, For this he was given three
pills. One of the pills was disguised as a greamalin
tablet and this tablet had three deltas or triangles
on it, Inside the white coverage was a core which
the subject deseribed as dark yellow. (It actually
appears to be more of an orange~brown color), The
second tablet was the same size as the first one, but
there wre no markings on the white outer coating,

The core of this second tablet was about the same
size as the first tablet, but subject described it as
being light yellow in color. ‘The third tablet also had a
white coating, but the coating was very thin. ‘The
tablet itself was much smaller in size and subject
described it as smaller than a Bayer aspirin tablet,

The cating was very thin and the core of this tablet

was deseribed by the subject as "ash" color, In trying
to more definitely define this subject was asked if
it would be described as a light gray and he indicated
that he felt an ash color more nearly described it,
but could not ‘explain actually what. the difference:

was.

NW 55080 DocId:32989537 Page 30



NY 65-18217

: Subjectwas advised that he should erush these
three tablets thoroughly, He has the impression that the
white coating on all three have no purpose whatsoever
and he therefore did not make any special effort to
retain all of the coating, He erushed the core 7
very carefully until it was in powder form with no
grains remaining, After all three cores had been
thoroughly crushed, they were placed in any solution
which contained 80 per cent or more alcohol, This

was then mixed very thoroughly and there was no time
limit placed on the mixing, After it was mixed thoroughly,
the paper containing the secret writing was held by

the edges, quickly inserted into the solution, and
sifted around in the solution for approximately ten to
fifteen seconds, Subject said it was necessary that the
solution cover the secret writing uniformly as
otherwise part of it would appear quickly and would be
over-exposed before the remainder was finished. He
said that it was necessary to watch this most ¢losely
as when the writing started to appear there was only a
time of a few seconds that it could remain in the
solution before it had to be removed, He said that

in training he often had difficulty in that the writing
would become visible along certain edges and he would
take the paper out too quickly, and as a result much of
the writing would never be visible.

. With regard to the 80 per cent alcohol,
subject said that they did not indicate that any certain
product was desirable, although he presumed that a
straight alcohol would be preferable. He said, however,
that he asked if gin could be used and they told him
it could, but that he should be careful and not drink
-| too much, He said that he subsequently used a cologne
for this purpose (Jaynor Alcoloyne - purchased in the
“United States) which contained_92 percent. alcohol, ----

With regard to the amount of liquid needed for
the solution, subject said they told him what the exact
amount was, but he had forgotten it as they gave him
an easy way to measure this, He said he was told to
take a normal glass (by description and measurement
this turned out to be an eight ounce glass) and then.
fi11 the glass approximately half full of the liquid,

He would then tilt the glass until the liquid barely
touched the lip of the glass and also barely touched the
raised part of the bottom of the glass. Thereafter,

he always added a very slight emount so that he actually
would have slightly over four ounces of liquid,

Subject said that any container could be used
for mixing the solution and for sifting the paper in
the solution, but inasmuch as the secret writing could
be on both sides of the page, it was necessary to see
that the solution was sifted over both top and bottom,
He demonstrated this by holding diagonally opposite
corners of a sheet of paper, quickly inserting them in a
liquid moving the paper back and forth, and then at
approximately 12 seconds removing the paper from the
liquid. He then shook the paper slightly and said that
nothing else was needed, that it could dry by itself,

i Subject said that in the event the paper was

! left in the solution too long the action could be
stayed somewhat by immediately placing it in cold

water after it was removed. He said, however, that this
did not do too much good.

With regard to the appearance of the secret
writing, he said that when developed it was a copper.
bronze color. He said that when it first began to appear
it appeared as a very light brown and that you had to . .

With regard to the effect the solution had
on ink, he said that while the ink ran and became
smeared all over the paper he said that it was actually
easier to read with this background than if a pencil
or typewriter had been used.

While one sheet was. normally developed at a time,

training was also given in developing two sheets at a
time, and subject thought that it might be possible to
do even more, but he thought this would be very
aifficult, He said that when two sheets were going to be
developed at the same time you doubled the amount of
alechol (eight ounces) and used a total of six pills,
The mixing was done exactly the same, Thereafter,
you separate the two sheets to be developed by placing
a pencil or some other hard object of a similar size
between the edges of the sheets, grasping them securely
and then inserting them in the solution and sifting
as previously described. He said that sometimes the
sides of the sheets facing each other did not receive
an even amount of the solution and this resulted in an
uneven development, He said that there was also a way
to prevent too rapid development of the writing and
he said this was done by taking a drink of water,
holding it in your mouth, and spraying lightly on the
paper, He said this was probably desirable if you
tried to develop two sheets at the same time. Subject
stated that in practicing the secret whiting and develop~
ing the secret writing he used the same paper and
developers that he was subsequently provided with (except
for the alcohol) and he is therefore certain that his

any of the cores of the pills, He said that for a
container for the solution he used a large dust pan,
which he cleaned thoroughly and then tilted slightly
by placing the lip of an ashtray or similar object.

and thereby forming a basin, He said anything of this
nature could be used and it could be tin, metal, or
glass.

Instruction in Use of Camera

Subject advised that he was instructed in the
use of a camera, He stated that he had a good working
knowledge of the operations of the camera and that this
phase of the instruction extended over a very short period,
possibly one or two days. He advised that he was not
instructed in the method of preparing mikrats or
microdots., He stated that he was instructed in the
technique of reading mikvrats with the use of the camera.
He advised that although he had had the instruction,
he was never able to read a mikrat by this means, He
advised that he was instructed by SCHILLER that -the
best way to read the mikrat was with the use of a microe
scope, but that in emergencies if no microscope were
available he could read the mikrat with the aid of the
camera in the following method: ‘The mikrat was to be

. placed on a piece of glass or transparent paper, such

‘as cellophane, Underneath the mikrat a light source

was to be placed, The lens of the camera was to be

opened to its widest capacity and the rear of the camera
was to be removed. The camera was then to be held at the
proper distance from the mikrat and by the use of the

eamera lens the mikrat would be sufficiently magnified to
enable it to be read, He stated that the distance ‘soa the
___mikrat-depended:-upon-the strength of the Térg ofthe camer,

was given a 35 mm, Kodak camera for practice purposes and

Training in the Use of Cipher

In the last two weeks of instruction, SCHILLER
gave subject the following instructions in the use of ciphers
which was to be used in his communications with his superior.
The secret writing processes which he had learned enabled
him to send hidden messages. These messages, for further
security, were to be inciphered when mention was made
of sensitive subjects, which would include names, addresses,
and so forth.

With regard to the above usage, the subject was
provided with a combination code book and cipher pad. He
stated that he believed he could determine the size of this
book because it had left an imprint in his wallet where he
had carried it. He viewed his wallet but could not ascertain
| the imprint. From memory, after looking at his wallet, he
stated that its approximate size was 3" x 23" x 3/8".

He described this book as follows:

It opened like a book rather than a pad. ‘The
outside of the book was a greyish-green plastic type cover.
The cover itself had no writing on the outside of it.

He did not recall how the paper was bound to the cover,

but stated that it must have been glued because the individual
sheets came out very easily. He descirbed the sheets of
this book as very thin paper. ‘The color of these pages
have the same color as parchment paper and he stated that
this color would most approximate ivory. He stated that the
pages were divided into two sections, the first half of

the book being the ciphers for receiving and the second
half being the ciphers for sending. The color of the pages
for both halves of the book was identical and they were
distinguished by a different color on the edges of the
pages; however, he could not recall the color utilized |
emembere + that they

‘ SECRET

were different. With regard to the writing on the pages,
he stated that the printing on the pages was smaller
than typing, however, he could not ascertain the exact
size of the printing.

He stated there were approximately 100 pages in
this book, fifty pages for receiving and fifty pages for
sending. He began using the first page for receiving
and then proceeded to the middle of the book for sending
rather than beginning at the opposite end. He believed
that the numbers were in five digit groups, that there
were about five groups to a line, and about forty lines
to a page. The lines ran consecutively for twenty lines
and then a double biank space appeared in the middle
of each page and twenty more lines appeared below this
spacing.

When sending or receiving a message he began using
the first half of the page. If the message did not

“necessitate the use of the whole twenty line group, he

the fact..that there was a-"u" in the code; but no "u"

disregarded any remaining numbers in the first half of the
page for his second message. He would begin his second
message then with the bottom half of the page. When he
finished with the two halves of any page, he tore this page
from his book and destroyed it by burning.

Cn the back inside cover of the book was the code
that he utilized. This consisted of the German alphabet
with numbers after the letters signifying what numbers
should be used for what letters. He stated that to the
best of his recollection, the majority of letters utilized
three digits, however, some had two and some had four
digits. The basic language used for the code was the German
language. The alphabet in the code book was not a complete

German alphabet, as several letters were missing. The missing

letters were repetitious letters which were differentiated
_by the use of an accent mark. He gave as an examnle

with an umlaut. In addition to the alphabet, the code

_ also contained punctvetion signs such es nemlods, commis,

and so forth and he believed that all punctuaticn signs

SECRET

NY 65-18217

consisted of five digits, There were no numerals in the
code and for the numbers zero through nine, the spelling
of these numbers was encoded. He stated that there
were also special signs in the code which also had
numerical equivilents although he could not remember
the number of digits used in these equivilents. He
said that there was a special sign that meant that

what followed this sign in the message was in the Latin
alphabet rather than the German alphabet, There was another
sign which meant that what followed this sign was again
going to be in the German alphabet. He stated that this

was necessary because being in America you would run

into words which could not directly be translated into
German and, therefore, would necessitate it to be written
ain English, The only other things appearing on the back
page of this code book was a set of numbers which was

his code name for sigriing his ‘secret writing message.

As an.example of how hé utilized this code he
provided the following ericoding of the word "dear":

He stated that when enciphering the code, the
numbers from the cipher pad were added to the code, which
had already been prepared. ‘The addition was done from
the beginning i.e., the left side of the line. When
the numbers were added and the total was more than 10,
only the last digit was put down, the first digit being
@ropped completely and not carried in the total.

General Instructions

After KUEHN introduced subject to SCHILLER, subject
visited the apartment in which he was trained alone. At
the first meeting alone with SCHILLER, after subject was in
the apartment for about an hour, SCHILLER received a
telephone call, after which he questioned subject as to
whether subject had noticed that he had been surveilled
from the music school to the apartment. Subject advised
that he had not made any such observation and SCHILLER
proceeded to tell subject in detail what he had done
and how he had travelled from the time he left the music
school until he arrived at the apartment. SCHILLER cautioned
subject that for security reasons le must be alert for
surveillance. He told him that in crossing streets he
should look back and observe whether any person was
following him. Subject advised that on three or four
subsequent occasions he observed KUEHN observing him
and so reported to SCHILLER, Subject stated that this
was the extent of training he had in surveillance detection.

Subject advised that in the last two months
- of his training the tempo of his meetings with SCHILLER
increased to four or five meetings a week. The training
period was from 9:00 a. m. to 3:00 p. m. or from 3:00
Pp. m. to 9:00 5. m In addition to the training periods,
subject was instructed and did make several trips from
the East Berlin sector to the West Berlin sector in order
to observe the security regulations of both the East.

to observe the baggage check procedures followed by both :
sides. SCHILLER instructed that subject was to particularly a
consider boarding a train on the Lichtenstein station

of East Berlin and to leave the railroad at the Bahnhof

Am. Zoo station in West Berlin, From West Berlin he was

to immediately embark via plane for Paris. He was

Adnstructéd that he should travel from the Bahnhof station

to the airline office and learn the procedure which he

would use when he was making this actual trip. Subject

advised that he made trial runs on three or four occasions.

Subject was advised that when in the United States,
in the event of an emergency, he was to use a drop in
Van Cortlandt Park, the location of which was described
to him. An entire album of photographs which depicted
the buildings in the vicinity of the emergency drop, the
park area through which he would travel toward the drop,
and the location of the drop shown from several angles
ain the photographs, Subject was instructed that if he
had to use this emergency drop he snould place a message
in it on the first Saturday of the first, third, sixth,
or ninth month. He should visit the drop if possible
before 6:00 p. m. He was told that any message he placed
in the drop should be in secret writing or code and he
was advised that the message could be rolled up tightly
and then covered with scotch tape in order to make it
waterproof. With regard to the first, third, sixth,
and ninth month, the subjéct said that they told him
every three months, but then did say first, third, sixth,
or ninth. Subject said that this was only an emergency
drop and he would not be expected to use it if he could
communicate with his principal through his normal mail
‘drop. He said this was the only drop that was provided
him in the United States.

The instructions which subject received to locate
the drop were as follows:

store. Proceed into the park in a direct line past an

open play area and proceed for about five minutes checking
behind you to make sure you are proceeding in a direct

line with the furniture store at your back. After about
five minutes walking, you will come to a slight rise. On
the other side of this rise are located three rocks. The
first rock about shoulder height on a man, the second rock
about three feet high in line with the first and the third
rock about one foot high and in line with the other two.
Under trethird ‘rock tnere will be located a container to
receive the messages. The subject stated that although

he could not remember exactly, there was some type of
path close by to the rock under which the container is
located. Subject further advised that said path was between
the first large rock and the remaining smaller rocks,

General Observations of Subject
During Training Period

Subject advised that from various things he observed
he was sure that the apartment in which he received his
training was also being used to train other individuals for
a similar purpose. He said that frequently on arriving at
the apartment, he would notice numerous cigarette butts
in the ash trays. He also on one occasion arrived at the
apartment approximately thirty minutes early and was told
at that time that he should not arrive before the appointed
time. Thereafter, if he would get to the apartment before
the scheduled time he would have coffee at a nearby cafe.

“ While sitting in this cafe he noticed another young German

about his age waiking by the cafe carrying books on several
occasions. Also, on one occasion, when he left the apartment
he noticed this same German in the cafe having coffee and,

in his own mind,he is quite certain this individual was
perhaps destined for the United States inasmuch as subjedt
noted that he had the same German-English books as did

the subject.

While the apartment building was obviously used
for- residential purposes, the apartment which subject
visited was at one end of the building and had large
antennas and also had the windows covered with heavy drapes.
Subject noted that on the opposite end of the apartment
building was another apartment with similar drapes and
antennas and he, thexefore, concluded that probably the
second apartment was utilized for the same purpose.

In the apartment where subject received his
training, he was always immediately escorted to one bedroom
wing of the apartment and remained in this wing all the
time he was there. He was quite certain that another
student was receiving training at the same time in the other
bedroom wing inasmuch as frequently he heard voices. In
addition, he was instructed never to come out of the rooms
he was in without knocking on the door and being permitted
to come ont, This was true whether he wanted to go to the
bathroom or wanted anything in connection with his work.

It was also true . ~ when he was through with his work
and ready to depart. Subject observed that on several
oceasicns ‘ie aiso heard female voices.

Subject stated that he believed that both KUEHN
and SCHILLER were members of the East German Secret Police,
They never asked him about other students or his friends.
Subje*t- aid not imow whether anyone else was aware of the
training ne was receiving, but he supposed that the principal
of the music school knew that he was under instruction
because on one occasion when he was unable to attend class

. the principal said to him "Oh, it's right you are busy. I

‘ will. get someone to substitute for you". Subject advised
that as the tempo of his meetings increased it was necessary
for him to miss some of his classes. SCHILLER instructed
him to skip the clésses and obtain a substitute. SCHILLER
reimbursed subject for the pay he would lose by missing
the classes. Subject recalls that the first payment he
received from SCHILLER was 400 East Germen marks. Fs udvwised

that SCHILLER paid him regularly in this fashion but did not
demand a receipt for the payments. He stated also that in
addition to the initial 300 marks which KUEHN had given

to him, KUEHN also had given him the funds from time to
time and KUEHN did not require that he sign a receipt.

7 Mail Drop Instructions

After subject was advised that he was to be sent
to the United States he was furnished the name of an
individual in France who was to be his mail drop. This
individual resides in the Saint Clichy area, a suburb of
Paris. Subject was told to send his letters to this
individual airmail and in the open text of the letters
was to indicate whether or not there was secret writings
by including the word serious or seriously on the tenth
Line of the open text letter. He was told that on the
flap of the envelope he should not put a return address,
just the name "Melvin Bushe"., With regard to letters
which he would receive, the word light or lightly on the
tenth line would signify to him that there was secret
writing on the letter. Letters which he receives would
have the name OSWALD BOUCHE on the flap of the envelope
with no city or country indicated. The open text of
these letters to him began "Dear Helmuth" and they are
signed OSWALD.

Subject was not told how often he should write or
how often he would receive letters, but was told that he
should not bother them with too many letters and he
therefore expected that he would communicate with them
perhaps every three months. He also said that he did not
expect to hear from them except when they answered his
letters. They indicated that they would acknowledge
receipt of his letters but indicated that it would be
unlikely that they would communicate with him except
after he had written them, Subject stated that the name
OSWALD BOUCHE was not the name of the person at the mait.

Receipt of Material and Preparations for Departure

* Approximately three or four days prior to the
time he was to actually depart for the United States,
subject was introduced by SCEILLER and KUEHN to a
third individual. Subject recalled that on this occasion
when the three of them were at the apartment, SCHILLER
and KUEHN were very nervous and were obviously hoping
that the individual coming to visit them would be impressed
with the subject and the training he had received. This
individual was late in coming to the apartment and KUEHN - :
and SCHILLER were very nervous whild waiting for his- arrival.

When the individual came, he was introduced by
name, but subject said that since he met this unlmown individual
only on this occasion and on the day that he actually travelled
to East Berlin, he does not recall this man's name. He
described this person as follows: -

Russian nationality; 40 years old; 230 pounds, 6 feet
tall; a footvall type with very rough mannerisms who spoke
German with a distinct Russian accent. His only distinctive
feature was his massive frame. This person questimedsubject
generally on the instruction he had received and then
congratulated him on passing his course and receiving the
trust which was being placed in him by his instructors.

This man had with him about six pages of forms which were
receipts for the property that subject was to receive in
connection with his trip to the United States as an
intelligence agent. Neither SCHILLER, KUEHN, or this man

had ever required subject to furnish a statement of cooperation.
In the numerous papers which subject signed at this time,

he believes that there was no statement of cooperation; -
however, he said that he signed the papers so quickly he

could not be certain. He states positively no mention

of a statement of cooperation was made to him nor was

it brought to his attention if it were among the papers

which he signed. At this time he received the nee rile

Travel to the United States - é

Subject advised that SCHILLER and the unknown
Russian drove to the Fastern section of Berlin. The Russian
and SCHEILLER both desired that the subject travel from East
Berlin by railroad to West Berlin from the Lichtenstein
Station to the Bahnhof An Zoo in West Berlin. Subject
advised that on his previous trial runs, he had decided
against travelling in this method inasmuch as the East
German police checked very carefully on this route. Subject

N\ therefore decided that he would travel from East Berlin to

West Berlin on the elevator, Reluctantly, SCHILLER. and
the Russian agreed to allow the subject to travel by elevator
and, accordingly, left him at an elevated station, ‘the exact
location of which subject does not recall.

Subject advised that on boarding the elevator train
he placed his luggage on a seat on one side of the car and he
himself sat on the opposite side Whenthe inspector passed
through the car, he glanced at the luggage, but since no one
was sitting by it, did nothing about it. He also looked at
the subject but did not address him, Subject advised that
this casual inspection was the regular routine and it was
for this reason that he decided to travel by elevator from
East Berlin to West Berlin,

Upon arrival in West Berlin, subject proceeded
immediately to the airline ticket office, He had been afforded
a schedule of flights by his instructors and also in his previous
trip to West Berlin, had checked the flight times himself. In
order to procure his ticket for transportation to Paris, he
displayed his French passport,

On arriving in Paris, subject destroyed his French
passport as he had been instructed to do by SCHILLER., He
destroyed it by tearing it up into small pieces and flushing
it down a toilet. : .

registering at various hotels.. .

While‘in Detroit, he stayed at the Hotel Metropole
under the name of ROY GORD from Chicago, Illinois. He stated
that he believes the time of his stay at the hotel was just
prior to the time that the British Royalty visited this area,

-and he believed he was in Detroit in May or June, 1959. The

He recalled that they included New York, Baltimore and
Detroit. He could not recall what the other two cities’
were, In addition to the postcard, he sent a total of three
letters to his mail drop advising of his travels, addresses
and so forth,’ He said he sent no information other than
concerning his experiences in his travels, In each of
his letters, he included a secret writing message as he
sent long letters to his mother: He said that actually
what he would do in determining how long his open text
letter was to be, was to first prepare a letter to his
mother and then prepare the open text letter which would
give him enough room to include that message to his mother
and a short message to his superiors, The three letters
subject sent were from New York City, .~

Subject received from his superiors four or five

eareful, not overlooking the importance of his task and
to proceed cautiously in his activities. He said that he
had expected to receive letters from his mother but actually
the only thing he received was a brief statement in two of

the correspondence with him, however, from the contents of the
letters which he received, he concluded that it was SCHILLER .
inasmuch as reference was made to certain things that he.and
SCHILLER had done together. :

Subject said that he last wrote his superiors in
approximately September, 1959, He said that he last heard
from them in approximately October, 1959, and that definitely

With regard to breaking off his activities, subject
said that he is not cus out for this type of work and was
sorry that he ever got involved. He said he got irivolved ©
as a result of promises made to him, and as a result of a
desire to help his mother, and also a personal desire to
come to the United States.

He said that after his arrival in this country, -he
continually worried and wanted to get out of the business,
He said that on his own he décided he was not cut. out for
this type of work and, therefore, decided to discontinue
his activities in such a manner that they would not know
what had happened to him and, therefore, would perhaps not
take any action against his mother and not cut out the money

décision to break away, he had disposed of his cade
book by throwing it in an open sewer in the city of
Connecticut. +He said that he had rationalized with
himself that he actually had not thrown it away but had
merely dropped it. He said that subsequently he had
destroyed two pads of the transfer paper and thought

he had destroyed all of the pills which contained the

i He said that he had not been told by his superiors where to
keep the money and had not been told by his superiors to

i conceal any money in the toilet kit or similar articles,

: He said the only instruction he had about concealing something
of this nature was that he was told he could carry his cipher
pad,in his shoe and he said this was a stupid instruction
becguse it wore blisters on his feet, He said, therefore,
he actually carried his cipher pad in his wallet.

With regard to the emergency drop in Van Cortlandt

but was familiar with the location of Van Cortlandt Park,
He said that he actually went to 259th Street and Broadway

the excavation site as a general guide, After proceeding
half a mile into Van Cortlandt Park, no rock formation was
located which approximated the subject's previous description,

stated, "Over there by that clump of trees", He explained
that seeing a particular clump of trees reminded him that he
observed a similar tree formation in the photographs which

arriving at the site of this clump of trees, various rocks
were located, none of which actually fitted the peculiar
formation described by the subject. Several attempts. were
made to move some of these rocks and one rock approximately

KAROT
ESP -R

Karot is code name of Kaarlo Rudolph Tuomi a
Soviet Military Intelligence. (GRU) illegal who cooperated
as a double agent with the FBI from March, 1959, until 1964,

In early 1959 when Tuomi appeared at a small town
in northern Michigan to acquire a copy of his Baptismal
certificate, a relative became aware of his presence, contacted
him, and inquired concerning status of his family which had
returned to Finland in the early 1930's, Tuomi panicked and
left the hotel where he was staying and an examination of
possessions left behind disclosed paraphernalia that could
be used in espionage activities.

Investigation disclosed a Kaarlo Rudolph Tuomi
was born 11/30/16, at Ishepeming, Michigan, both parents
born in Finland, State Department records disclosed Tuomi
at age 16 departed the United States in 1932 with his parents
to return to Finland and there was no record of him having
reentered the United States or having applied for a U. S.
passport.

In view of the results of the investigation and our
past knowledge that Soviet illegals had assumed the identity
of someone who had left the United States it appeared certain
we had an espionage subject and whether this individual was
the real Tuomi or not he apparently entered the United States
in a fraudulent manner. His activities gave the appearance
of an illegal in the initial phase of familiarizing himself
with his cover identity.

The decision was made to interview subject in hopes
of developing him as a double agent, realising the subject
would flee if he detected our coverage. Subject was interviewed
from 3/9/59 to 3/18/59 at a summer house in Hartland, Wisconsin,
and agreed to cooperate. Subject advised he was recruited
into the GRU and in May, 1957, commenced illegal training in
Moscow, Subject furnished invaluable information regarding
the communications systems involving the illegal networks
and furnished information which assisted in the identification
of other GRU illegals. During the period subject operated

as a double agent almost one hundred messages were exchanged
with the Soviets. He received $25,000 in payment from them
and furnished invaluable insight into Soviet illegal operations
in the United States,

Facts concerning this case have received consider-
able publicity assa result of an article published in the
April,,1970 issue of "Readers Digest" and John Barrons book
"KGB - The Secret Work of Soviet Secret Agents." In addition
Tuomi has traveled throughout the United States speaking
before various groups as to his experiences.

SUBJECT: KAARLO RUDOLPH TUOHI, also known as f
ESPIONAGE - R :
Attached its memo analyzing this case porl purpose of &
determining our future course of action in tt. H j

Briefly, an individual claiming to be Kaurlo Rudolph Tuomi
appeared at a Lutheran Church in Megaunee, Michigan, 2-15-59 and requested
copy of baptismal certificate from pastor, He claimed to have been born
in area. He was to pick up the certificate the following morning but did
not do so. Passport records disciose that Clarles Rudolph Tuomi, born
11~30+16 Ishpeming (near Negaunee), Michigan, departed the U.S. for Russta
mt, ats mother and stepfather, Robert Saastamoinen, in 1932, There is no
record of Juomt's return to the U.S. Subject has been under surveillance
since 2-17-59 and in addition to & chigan has visited parts of Minnesota
and #isconsin, He ts presénmuly svaying atc reeming house in MiTwmankea-
the earliest date we have been able to place hin in the U.S, ts 1-5-59.

We located a registration for thie individual on that date at the

George Washington Hotel in New York City. He was at this hotel until
1-26-59 when he went to the Mid-West. Investigation has located 2 smali
savings accounts for subject in the New York area. He also had a small
account in Milwaukee bank which he recently closed, Most significant
development to date occurred on 2-28-59 when he was observed mailing a
lette® in Milwaukee. Through an anonymous source it was determined that
the letter was addressed to an address in Helsinki, Finland, ‘fhe return
address on the envelope was wo. Sgollins, Milwaukee, Wisc." The contents of
the letter, while innocuous, appear susptctous and could have double meaning
Since he discusses health matters and then goes into long dissertation on
American automobiles and winds up his letter with reference to the wedding
of @ cousin in June, Investigation has also disclosed subject has given
employnent with a place of business in Wisconsin which went out ofbusiness
2® years previously and used a New York address of an apartment building
which was torn down in 1958, There is indication he could be the real
Tuomi. An uncle of Tuemt furnished us coptes of correspondence sent by
Tuomt from Russia in 1951, 1952 and 1953. Comparison of the handwriting
in these letters with known handwriting of subject appearing on hotel

regi stration cards revealed they are identical. This uncle also furnished
@ 1952 photograph purportedly of Tuomi sent from Russia. Some survetlling
Agents who have observed subject belteve he ts tdentical with the 1952
photograph while other survetlling Agents do not believe sa. :

Whether subject ts real Tuomi or not, there is every indi-
cation he has entered the U.S. in a clandestine manner to act as an
"“llegal” agent. He appears to be in the initial phase of his
operation, tees, building up his background gnd familiarizing him-
self with the country. It will probably be several months before he
engages tn any significant activitiese

A careful analysis as to action we should take indicates two
alternatives, namely?

(1) Continue to attempt coverage of subject by surveillance,
hoping he wiil reveal contacts and possible associates tn esptonage
activity. This we feel unwise as it isa highly defensive position
hag the probability of success not balanced in our favor. If sub=
tued in U.S. (as tt eppears) it may de monthe be-
Fore fe makes any esptonage contacts and any surveillance over this
extended period of time may well be detected and subject might dis~
appear with little of value gained by us. By letting subject carry .
on we would be letting him pick his own course of action and we :
would be constantly on the defensive trying to guess his moves and |
defend against theme

e - (2) Intensively interview subject before he gets his cover
in this country all set and while he is still away from Mew York
(probably his base of operations). We have developed considerable
information which subject will have to refute and the unexpected in=
terview, plus our knowledge, may put him on the defensive and give
us @ psychological edge. Our prime target inanillegal case is to
penetrate the network and develop a double agent. This case gives
us an opportunity and the value to the U.S., tf successful, would be
tremendous. Recognizing that if unsuccessful the intensive inter-
view probably required. will rule out subsequent prosecution or pub=
licity, we can still neutralize subject. In the remote event the
subject should .be legitimate, this could be quickly determined early
in the interview and there would be no probleme We feel the tn»
tensive interview, over an extended period of time if necessary, is
the proper course of actione

RECOMMENDATION: if

That we ley plans to interview subject in the immediate
4future, when we feel subject's whereabouts and movements best fit

7 The purpose of this memorandum is to consider steps to
be taken in this case by the Bureau at this time.

Origin of Case

: On 215-59 an individual claiming to be Kaarlo Rudolph Tuont
appeared at a Lutheran Church in Negaunee, Michigan, and requested a
baptismal certificate from the pastor stating he would pick it up at
10 a.m, the next day. He indicated he was born and raised in Negaunee
and later moved with his parents to Minnesota. He further tndicated he
was working in Milwaukee. He was staying at the Bertung Hotel tr
Negaunee and suddenly left town on 2-16-59 without receiving the
certificate after receiving a telephone cail from a Mrs. John Tr" Koski
of Vegaunee who inquired tf he were the Rudolph Tuomi who had been in
Russia, which he denied. Prior to departing, he indicated to the pastor
of the church he had business in Escanaba, Michigan, and he stated he
would return for the certificate during the summer. Baptismal records
of the church reflected a Kaarlo Rudolph Tuomi listed therein.

7 Interview of Mrs. Koski disclosed she had cousin with same
name “as subject born in Negaunee area 42 years ago. His father died
4 months later and mother married Robert Saastamoinen, Several years
later the entire Saastamotnen family including subject went to Russia.
Upon hearing an individual bearing her cousin's name was in town she
decided to contact him at the hotel. Mrs. Koski advised that another
cousin, Andy Marlowe of Lake Worth, Florida, had corresponded regularly
with Tuont in Russia.

At the Bertung Hotel subject had given his residence as 626
North Third Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and occupation as the lumber
business. A source had previously observed tn subject's room at the
hotel foreign-made camera and a letter addressed to subject at the
George Washington Hotel, New York Ctty, dated 1-18-59,"

Bufiles are negative on this name and address. In the lexvter the
writer talks about health, He then goes into @ long dissertation

on American automobiles. He ends his letter by mentioning that his
coustn, Sylvia, is to be marrted in June. ‘The contents appear
suspicious. It ts known that in other espionage cases the discussion
of health has had a double meaning to indicate that everything was
well, With respect to the ending of his letter i¢ could indicate
that he should be contacted in June. The Cryptographic Section of
the FBI Laboratory is analyzing this letter to determine if it has
any esptonage significance,

Andy Marlowe, Lake Worth, Florida, was interviewed 2-19-59
and advised that Rudolph Tuomi is his sister's son, therefore his
nephew, who left the United States for Russia around 1931 with his
nother and stepfather. He advised that Rudolph's mother and stepfather
are now deceased. He corresponded with his nephew over the years,
recetuing his last letter in 1956, He stated his nephew married a
Russian girl and has 2? children and stated he was employed in Russia
aooan English teacher, He furnished & piioloyruph seni iv him by Tuomi
tn 1952 whitch purports to be Tuomt and 4 letters purportedly written
by hts nephew in 1951, 1952 and 1953, he FBI Laboratory has advised
us that the handwriting in these letters ts identical with the hand-
writing of subject appearing on various registration cards of hotels
at which subject has stayed. Surveilling Agents who have observed
subject disagreed as to whether subject appears identical with the 1952
photograph furnished by Marlowe. Miiwaukee Agents believe that he may
be identical while Minneapolis Agents do not believe so.

7 Ihe earliest date we have been able to determine that subject
has been in this country is 1-5-59, New York located a registration of
subject at the George Yashington Hotel on that date, According to the
hotel records, subject stayed at the Gearge Washington Hotel until 1-26-52.
He indicated that he would return to the hotel around 3-15-59 and
requested that a room be reserved for him. He gave his residence to
the hotel as 3665 Fast Mallory Avenue, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and his
employment as the B & @ Yoodworking Company, Milwaukee. Investi-
gation discloses that 626 North Third Street, Milwaukee (address given
by subject to Bertung Hotel) ts the Kilbourn Hotel in Milwaukee, and
3665 East Mallory Avenue (address given by subject to the George
Washington Hotel in Wew York) is the address of the B & @ Foodworking

1? years of age at the time of his acquisition of Soviet citizenship
through naturalization of his stepfather and since no information was
avatlable that he gave his consent to Soviet naturalization, a
certificate of expatriatton would not be prepared on the stepson until

ee a
| nd SECRET e

To date we have been'unable to determine the da,
mode of entry of subject into the United ceiahihal We are scil
continuing our efforts to resolve this, . t

Courses of Action that May be Taken

Fron the foregoing there appear to be ‘overwhelming
tndications that subject, whether or not he ts the real Tuomi,
has recently re-entered the United States in a clandestine manner.
Eis activities to date appear to be that of an “illegal” agent in
the initial phase of his operation, t.@65 building up his background
as an American by familiarizing himself with that part of the
United States Tuomt originally came fron so that he wili be above
suspicion in playing the part. The next phase will probably be for
hia to establish for himself a residence and business cover.

Assuning that subject is an "illegal" who has recently
arrived tt wili probably be several months before subject engages
in any activities such as noakbng contacts. (Votes In the Aves CaSes,
Reino Hayhanen's initial contact was made about 7 months after he
entered the United States).

According to Agents having subject under surveillance he
does not appear to be surveiilance conscious, This could be explained
by the fact that he has not considered it necessary to check for
survetillances since he ts not ready to make any contacts of significance.
Then first question that arises is whether we should continue our
efforts to cover subject with the hope of maktng his contacts and
uncovering an espionage network, Of course, tt must be realized that
as time goes on we run the risk of subject detecting such coverage
and disappearing from sight. From a counterintelligence standpoint
tt could be to the best interest of the United States to attempt to
cover his activities and tdentify his contacts with the end in mind
of developing an espionage prosecution. However, inasmuch as such
coverage would have to be maintained for several months the risk of
losing him increases, If, he does disappear, our SL eta of
uncovering hts operations would be lost forever.

An alternative course of action would be to take our
chances of approaching him at this time with the hope of breaking
him and possibly operating him as a double agent. If he refuses to
cooperate we will have at least neutralized him, In considering our
chances of developing him, t% is felt we might have a psychological
advantage particularly if we are right in believing that he is a new
arrival in this country. In attempting to establish himself he
undoubtedly is under some tension and uncertain of himself.

KAARLO RUDOLPH TUOMI

ESPIONAGE - RB \

The two alternatives boil down to tid at

(1) Continue to attempt coverage of subject by survetllance,
hoping he will reveal contacts and possible associates in esptonage
activity. This we feel unwise as it ts a highly defensive position
with the probability of success not balanced in our favor. If suba
ject recently arrived in U.S. (as tt appears) it may be months be-
fore he makes any espionage contacts and any survetilance over this
‘extended period of time may well be detected and subject might dis~
appear with little of value gained by us. By letting subject carry
on we would be letting him pick his own course of action and we
would be constantly on the defensive trying to guess his moves and
defend against theme

(2) Intensively interview subject before he gets his cover
in. this country all set and while he is still away from New York
(probably his base of operations). We have developed considerable
information which subject will have to refute and the unexpected in=
terview, plus our knowledge, may put him on the defensive and give
ug @ psychological edges Our prime target in@millegal case is to
penetrate the network and develop a double agent. This case gives
us an opportunity and the value to the U.S., tj successful, would be
tremendous. Recognizing that if unsuccessful the tntenstve inter=
view probably required will rule out subsequent prosecution or pub=
ltecity, we can still neutralize subject. In the remote event the
subject should be legitimate, this could be quickly determined early
tn the interutew and there would be no problem. We feel the in~
tensive interview, over an extended period of time tf necessary, is
the proper course of acttone

v the Finnish front until 1944, at which time a portion of
the regiment was sent to the derman front, and he was placed in a
it that was assigned to rear echelon duty on the) Finnish ‘front.

Subject entered the Soviet Army as a private in 1939 and served.
in e trangport corps. He later was assigned to the infantry
and was discharged in 1946 with the rank of corporal. In this
year he returned to the town of Kirov where. he -had served in
the A during 1944 and 1945. He met his wife, ANTONIA, in
“May, T9N6 and married her on September 12, 1946 in Kirov.

From 1946 to 1950, he attended the Institute in Kirov where he
majored in English and from 1950 to 1958, he taught English
in Kirov schocis.

In 1951, Subject was contacted by a representative of the Russian
Committee of State Security known to him as "ARKADI MIKHAILOVICH,"
and was queationed with regard to his friends and relatives:
vesiding in tne U.S. This person exhibited credentials bearing
the stamp of the "Committee of State Security." Subject told

‘him about his uncle, ANDREW MARLOWE, and friends residing in
Rock, Michigan and that he had written to his uncle in 1936

and 1937. ‘The representative of ‘the State Security then asked -
Subject to write to his friend, NEIL HARJU, and his uncle. Subject
did so and the letters were edited by "ARKADI MIKHAILOVICH" before
being mailed..--Subject said that at that time he recalied HARJU's
address as being Box 106, Rock, Michigan and that his uncle

lived in Minnesota. He had also remembered his uncle's address
because his mother had corresponded with him. Subject received

‘ answers to his letters from both HARJU and ANDREW MARLOWE.
However, Subject wrote a later letter to MARLOWE in which

he enclosed a photsgraph of himself, but he received no reply

to this letter. Subject received a photograph of NEIL HARJU

in response to his letter which photo was turned over to "“ARKADI
MIKHAILOVIcH."

In 1956, he was called to the lecal hotel in Kirov by “ARKADI
MIKHAILOVICH" who was accompanied by another man. Subject was
again questioned with regard to his relatives in the U.S. and |
whether he had a birth certificate, report card, his father's
lh certificate or any other personal documents of U. S.
origin. : #

Subject explained that these items had been in the possession of
his mother and that she had died in 1942, He said that “in 1938

MIKKONEN was Subject's helper in his work as lumber jack } Subject
felt that MIKKONEN might know'something about the- whéreabduts |
of the records in question and made an effort to locate her
through the mail and also through official channels. He never
received an answer from this. woman and the records were never
located. I . :

Early in 4957, Subject was recontacted by "ARKADT MIKHAILOVICH"
who brought with him the same man whom the subject believed to

. . be a representative of Soviet Military Intelligence. Subject

“" was asked if.-he would be willing to take an assignment in
northern Norway or Finland. This man described the assignment
-as easy, of one month's duration and similar to Army retraining.
Two months later, Subject agreed to this assignment, but he was
never sent to either Norway or Finland because he was merely
being tested to determine if he would be willing to accept an
assignment outside of Russia.

In March, 19575 this same military intelligence man again contacted
Subject and told him that some people in Moscow were. interested

in him and furnished him with some money for himself plus travel
toney: to Moscow. Subject spent five or six days in Moscow during
which time he was questioned closely about his relatives in the U.S. .-

Subject was then asked if he would be willing to accept an intelligence
signment in the U.S. and hews told that his a was a
OQluntary one.

_ At this time, Subject was teaching English in two schools in Kirov
besides chopping wood in order to make sufficient money for his
family to live. .For all of his work, Subject received about

1050 rubles per month. His wife received another 500 ae
per month, but living conditions were very poor.

Subject explained that he, his wife, his son, VICTOR, born in 1947,
and his two daughters, IRENE, born in 1951, and NADEZDHA, born

in 1953, lived in a one-room apartment in Kirov. The family ate
and slept in this one room in the center of which was a Russian-
type stove. Toilet and kitchen facilities were shared with other
people living in the apartment building.

Because of these conditions, Subject accepted the intditigencé
assignment in the U.S. after he was offered more pay and beter

Intelligence Training School : tt

In May, 1957, Subject returned to Moscow wrre ng was met by the
same representative of military intelligence previously referred
to and taken to an apartment which he described as being on the

. Oth Floor of a building in which building the elevator ran only
to the 8th floor, The only floor above him in this_building
was an attic. The apartment was composed of a kitchenette
containing a gas steve, refrigerator and table. The livimg
room contained a television set, radio, table, a grandfather's

. Glock that rang every half hour and an old-fashioned cupboard
with a glass door for dishes. The bedroom had twin beds,
wardrobe and 4 big mirrer with a dressing table that was
located on the wall opposite the doorway.: In the attic there
wes a room for photography work. :

Although the first approach to Subject had been made by a representa-
tive of State Security, he realized, upon entering his intelligence
training in Moscow, that he would be working for Soviet Military
Intelligense. He stated he was required to sign a statement in -
which he pledged to work fer Soviet Military Intelligence and
“keep any information coming to his attention in a secret and
egnfidential manner. Subject stated tht he thought that he was —
probably assigned to work for Soviet Military Intelligence

because of the fact that he had a knowledge of English which

.would enable him to be of service to Military Intelligence abroad.
He had never been advised as to the difference between Soviet

State Security and Soviet Military Intelligence but he assumed

that Soviet State Security was responsible for detecting foreign
intelligence organizations working within the USSR. He said :
that he believed that State Seourity would send some representatives
abroad for the purpcae of determining if a particular foreign
government was sending agents into Russia, He believed, however,
that this representative of Stato Security working in a foreign
country was not charged with any espionage responsibilities in —
that particular country. In his own estimation, Subject thought
that the responsibilities of Military Imtelligence were to carry

on espionage activities in foreign countries. He also, pointed

out that hs knew of another Soviet intelligence agency*calied
Economic Intelligence put he did hot know if this organization

was a part of State Security or Soviet Military Intelligence,

ow all of the facts which he taught through actual experience,
But had obtained some of his information through books and reports

from other persons. ~ :

‘With regard to determining surveillances in the US, Subject

was instructed that he should use side streets. with very few

people in ordar to ascertain the identity of any persons who

may be following him. He was also instructed to find some reason
to look behind him such as tying his shoelace. Besides this,

he was instructed, when working in a particular city, to locate ’
a number of places that are particularly adaptable because of

their physical surroundings to losing any surveillance which

may be piaced on him. Ag an example of such a place, subject

“mentioned that a department store would be suitable. He was

also taught that when he mailed a letter, he must be absolutely
certain that he wasn't being followed but he was not instructed

Subject atated he knew of one person who was Inot considered a
fallure and who is now in the Soviet Union where he is writing
a book. He is retired end living on a pension, He described
this person as an agent for the Soviet Union: ih thel920's and
that he had established himself in the button business in the
U. S. He was toid that during the period of time that this man
operated in the U. S., methods of communication between Soviet
intelligence agents were very simple, He said that this man
even went to the extent.of calling a conference of his agents.

Subject stated that his assignment in the U. S. between the years
1959 and 1962 was to establish a legal background here through
such methods as obtaining his birth record, paying taxes, getting
a job or going into some business for himself and making friends.

’ With regard to his friends, he was to obtain their political
ideas and determine their attitude toward various world problems.
Ho, was instructed that he should not solicit any information
regarding matters of intelligence from his established friends.
He was not to carry out eny intelligence operations but if he did
obtain information of Intelligence value, he was to send it
to the authoribics in Moscow. As an example of intelligence
of value be the Soviet Union, Subject stated that something
euch as sending U. S. missile weapons to the Near East would
be considered of sufficient importance to advise Moscow, He
was told that he sheuid obtain an apartment andattend some
Amertean school where he could receive an education in some subject
fhatwould aid him in estabitshing a business or getting a job.
With regard to looking for business opportunities, he was advised
that after ho gained experience in that particular business,

“he was to jatorm them of the complete details regarding that
business and that they might con8ider giving him sufficient
capital to establish a business of his own or to invest in
another business and besoma a partner therein. Subject believed
that tho Seviebs might duvest as much as $10,000 if a suitable
business opportunity can be losated,

Subject sald that in his own mind, he considered the possibility
of investing in a business in Now York City where he would not
have te work full time. This would give him sufficient spare
time bo enasse in his intelligence operation. He was also told
that $800.00 had been aliottad to him for the purchase of a

used aubomebiie. He would obtain thin automobile after he

had securad a driver's license in New York. Subject advised
thab he was being padd $450 per month by the Soviets and that
his wife and family recoived 1600 rubles in addition to the

said that he was to inform Moscow on all aspects of :
life. This information would) be used by the Military /)
Intelligence Training Schocl to train other agents. , [ii

Although Military Intelligence did not advise him definitely
with regerd to this point, they hinted that later in his
intelligence career he would probably be working with someone
else. He was not, however, to reeruit anyone during his first
three-year assignment in‘the U.S. He said that’ after he would
have been sent back to the U.S. for a second assignment, he
might have been permitted or ordered to recruit someone else
for Soviet Military Intelligence and those persons whom he
recruited would probably work under his direction. He stated
that he had planned on making a few friends during his Midwest
tour of the U.S. in January and February, 1959 which acquaintances
he could use in the future as references.

He was clso advised that he should stay away from and have no
connection with Communist Party members in forming his friendships
and acquaintances in the U.S, He was plan fold to avoid all
Communist jocations. AS an example of his attitude with regard
to these instructions, he stated that one day while in New York
City, he decided to walk from the George Washington Hotel on
23rd Street to Broadway ‘ind then down Broadway to the Battery.
This was just a sight-seeing, window-shopping walk. He said
that while walking south on Broadway, he noticed a book store
featuring Russian books in the window and he entered the store.
After looking around the shop, he became alarmed when he
realized that this was a "Communist" book store. He immediately
left the store. He stuted the name of the store was "fhe Four
Continent Book Store." In his own mind, he also decided tht

he would have no associutions with Finnish groups because he
feereaeee the Finns as being too clannish and knowing each other
oo well.

Radio Training

During the time that he “attended the intelligence school,

there was some talk about giving him lessons in receiving radio
messages through Morse Goede. It was anticipated that these
lessons in redio would commence upon his return from his
training trip through Eurcpe. However, subject stated he

was never provided with this particular training inasmuch as

the Places in ‘northern Michigan and northern Minnes' sta! where he
had ‘lived as a child. He had also decided that he would] attempt
to obtain his baptismal certificate at' the church whe he had

_ been baptized in Negaunee, Michigan, although he had not! been
instructed to obtain the certificate by meine intelligence.

From January 28 until February 11, 1959 the Subject visited the

various places of employment which had been given to him by

_ Soviet intelligence to be used by him in his cover story.

With regard to finding the micredet in the tbl he -
stated that he would first run his fingers over the paper to
determine if he could detest a slight rise in the -paper. If
he could not fied the mickodot in this method, he stated that
he would examine the paper for a logical hiding place. He said
that the most lorgierl hiding place would be where the communica-
tion had a black background. The technique used by the sender
in concealing the dut would be to slit the postcard at the point

_-of the black background #nd insert the microdot in between the

a slit paper and reseal it. The sender would also scrape a little:
of the paper away to make a bed for the dot. The microdot
should be inserted at least one-half inch into the postcard.

If he could nol find the microdot by either of these methods,
he would take the entire communication and drop it into the

Kodak 72 Developer. This would causes the micropoint to turn
black and thus enable him to perhaps detect it with his eye.

With regard to reading the contents of the micropoint, he stated —
_ that a twenty power mageiiying glass would be strong enough to
read the micropoint, if it had beon written in large type.
‘He stated that he could make bis own magnifying glass with the
ugé of a ten power waynifying glags and an eight powor magnifying
glass. He stated that he would form a cardboard tube and would
insert the ton power magnifying glasa in the lower portion of
*the tube and the eight power magnifying glass in the upper
portion of the tubs. He would thon adjust the magnifying glasses
with relation to each other within the tube, The micropoint
would be placed on a piece of glass and covered with another
Piece of glass: and by the use of a mirror he would shine light
up through the mic,opoint, Daylight could be used for this
light. The magnifying glesses would then have to be adjusted
‘wlth relation fo Lhe micropoint. After some experiment he
stated that if is poysible to find the exact distance between
the tro magnifying giaeses and the micropoint. By inserting the
two pieces ef glasa which contain the micropoint between them
in @ book so that tbe micrapoint protrudes from the book, it
1s possible to permanratly ascertain the exact location of the
-mderpoint by noting the paxe of the book, and in a similar
manner the magnidying glagges with the cardboard tube can be
narked for future use, i : : r oo

GUNSON
ESP - R

Gunson is code name for a Soviet Military Intelli-
; gence (GRU) illegal identified in September, 198], utilicdias
the identity of Richard Earl Hauta. Subject was identified
as the result of the Sam Survey program which was a program
whereby Special Agents reviewed air mail directed to specific
European cities and countries with the object of identifying
correspondence of Soviet illegal agents, In September, 1961,
subject became a prime suspect as a Soviet illegal utilizing
an accommodation address in Helsinki, Finland.

Background investigation disclosed that Richard
Earl Hauta was born 11/21/26 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His
father was listed as Axel Hauta who was born 2/26/03 Brantwood,
Wisconsin, and his mother, Adi Hauta was born 10/12/05 in
Clifford, Wisconsin. The Hauta family obtained passports to
travel to Finland in 1931. A review of State Department
records revealed that during the middle 1940's the Hauta
family was in the Soviet Union and there was no record
in State Department files to indicate the réturn of Mr. or
Mrs. Hauta or the son, Richard Earl to the United States.

He was employed as a photographer by Roberts Studio, |
3072 Steinway Street, New York, New York, since May, 1959,
and resided at 1703 Montgomery, Bronx, New York. Investigation
pointed out discrepancies in Hauta's documentation and an
FBI Laboratory examination of a letter directed to
Hauta established that the letter was typed on the same
typewriter utilized in sending communications to the subject
of the Karot case, a GRU illegal who cooperated as a double
agent with the FBI from May, 1959 until 1964.

In view of the successful results of the Karot
the subject was interviewed and cooperated with the

ase
FBI as a double agent until his departure from the United States

on May 16,.1962.

Subject was interviewed from 9:30 a.m, 10/16/61

u i he was
+il noon 10/22/61 under secure conditions when s
released and proceeded unaccompanied to his residence in
Bronx, New York. Subject admitted he was Leonard vassilevitch
Lebedinsky, porn on 1/20/25 at Kotovsk, Odessa, Ukrainian

into the Soviet Intelligence Service in 1955 and began his
training as an illegal in the GRU in an apartment in Moscow

at that time. Subject furnished complete information pertaining
to his training and assignments in the United States, the
methods of communications and identified two other Soviet
illegals with whom he had been in contact with in the

United States. He advised his assignment related to the
development of information concerning naval operations, the
Berlin situation and any mobilization plans under way in the
United States. '

Subject cooperated as a double agent until he
departed to the Soviet Union in May, 1962, in accordancé with
instructions from Centre on anticipated home leave with the
expectation he would return to the United States. To this
date he has never returned. An analysis of other activities
pertaining to this case indicates that subject would not be
returning to the United States.

In view of the fact that subject cooperated with
the FBI, returned to the Soviet Union, and exact whereabouts
are not known at this time, this information should be closely
held so as not to effect the security of the subject.

ESPIONAGE ~ R.

Subject is the. Soviet. illegal agent uncovered in New York
on 9-3-61 as a result of highly confidential airmail coverage. iIn-
vestigation has determined he is using the identity of an individual
born in Milwaukee who went to the Soviet Union with his parents at
an early age. Fi 5 7

ASAC Schmit, NYO, ‘advised on 9-29-61 that a letter has been
intercepted today addressed to the subject. This letter was typed on
the same typewriter utilized in sending communications to the Soviet
illegal agent who is our informant in the KAROT case. In fact, a
letter prepared on this typewriter addressed to our informant was mailed
in NYC at 10:30 PM on 9-27-61 Prd the letter to the subject was mailed
in NYC at 10:30 PM on 9-28-61. 7

4 ‘The contents of the envelope addressed to subject were two
sheets of advertising material of the Gray Manufacturing Company,
High Fidelity Division. The lower right hand corner of each sheet
has been folded which, as we know from the KAROT case, means there
yis secret writing on the back of the paper. The paper is also folded
“so that the blank side is on the inside in order to protect the secret,
writing.

ASAC Schmit said that NY was in favor of withholding this
letter from the subject and conducting an immediate interview of him
of the type conducted in the KAROT case. He said in the alternative
should it be decided the letter go through, New York still felt an
immediate interview should be conducted. Schmit said this recom-
mendation is:* based on the fact that in the two most recent illegal
cases (the Soviet illegals in the HEKLAR and PEBBLE cases) they di
appeared shortiy after receipt of a communication. He pon ao
this recommendation on the fact that the great advances we e~nade
in the illegal field were obtained as a result of the interview of

agents conduct themselves and the secure systems they have for con-
munication make it extremely. unlikely that normal investigative
measures would provide information concerning the actual clandestine
activities, He said that recognizing the extreme difficulties in
such an interview, he felt the interview should be conducted and he
felt the letter should be withheld from the subject to prevent any
possibility of it containing’any instructions for him to disappear.

OBSERVATIONS:

.

pms New York's position has merit and it may well be that
after subject receives the letter he may disappear, Jt is also true
that the great potential in one of these cases is in doubling the in-
dividual and this can only be accomplished through an interview.
Nevertheless, we have been extremely discreet in our investigation of
this subject to date. We are accumulating information about the in-
dividuals he is in touch with in New York and about his habits and
personality, all of which will be helpful should we subsequently
want to interview him. We have been investigating him less than a
month and we believe that additional time may enable us to obtain
more valuable information concerning him. We therefore feel that
| ve should permit the letter to go through and run the calculated risk
in hopes that at a subsequent time we will be better prepared to
conduct an interview or take any additional action warranted. It
is recognized that a decision as to interview will probably be desir-
able within the near future. We will analyze this case on a day to
day basis and in the event we feel an interview is warranted we will
Submit appropriate recommendations.

ACTION:

After discussing this with you and Mr. Belmont, I tele-
phonically advised ASAC Schmit to very carefully get the letter back
in appropriate channels in the same condition as received for delivery
to the subject. I told him that we did not desire_an.interview based
kamen ‘on the information _available—now,—but—we- ‘would -be-continually ‘analyzing

4 on {0-3-61 I contacted ASAC Schmit, New York, and ad-

vised hint that the Bureau was desirous of New York proceeding
with an>appropriate interview.of subject. I told Schmit that
New York should acquire an’ appropriate site which could be utili-
zed for an interview of this type and which would be available
for the length of time needed. He was also told to promptly sub-
mit G@etailed plans with regard to how New York intended to approach
subject : with regard to the personnel to be utilized for the inter-
view, and with regard to the means and manner of notification to
people subject is’ in daily contact with to allay any suspicions on
their part. While it is not known definitely how this would be
done, it may be desirable to at least notify his employer and his
landlord, It was suggested to Schmit that since subject claims to
be from Milwaukee, it might be desirable in this regard to consider
a telegram from Milwaukee saying he was called out there suddenly
because of family, matters,

New York has been considering the possibility of interview
and has been checking into available sites for an interview and
Ean advised that he would sybmit detailed plans to the Bureau
within the next few days.

MISCELLANEOUS
Extent of Illegal Agent Activity in the United States ae

E He had been advised that ‘in the central
sections of the ‘United States, it is sometimes very
difficult to obtain good radio reception. He further
advised that.it was his opinion that it used to be
customary for all GRU illegals sent to the United States
to initially start in New York City and become acclimated.
He advised that it has-now changed and that it is’
possible they are sent to other ae cities during

their initial assignments.

On one occasion, one of his instructors
commented that it was necessary to send people to areas
-other than New York because "New York is becoming over-
crowded with our people". -He had no idea as to the
number of illegals who tnight be stationed in the United
States. He did state, however, that he felt that: the
KGB had a greater number than - the GRU.

He advised that during his.training he
was told that during the TRUMAN Administration in the
United States, they had a highly placed source who was
able to provide them with high level decisions made
at the White House level. These decisions reached
Moscow within the 36 hours.after being made. The
Soviets in turn were able to bring pressure to bear at
a high White House level in an effort to counteract
the benefits of some of these decisions. He could not
elucidate further on this.

Info Re GRU, KGB : ; oe

He felt that the KGB obtained most of
its applicants for illegal work from the universities
and that they also obtained people attached to official
establishments in English speaking countries although
he did not believe they would be from Canada or the
‘United States itself... - --

.He advised that the GRU did not permit :
people who would be working together in the United States a
to meet and train in the Soviet Union, but that the KGB
does follow this procedure. He believed that a number of
KGB illegals were selected from persons attached to
‘legal establishments and that some GRU illegals were
selected in this matter. ”

He stated that he believes* that the KGB
would train their illegals to accomplish specific
objectives whereas the GRU trains its people to operate
as illegals anywhere and in any capacity. The GRU is
more flexible and feel that as a result ‘they have the
better intelligence system.

ro: IR. suLLavan pate: 4=10-63

This case involves the Soviet female
illegal agent residing in New York City.

Attached is the memorandum which was
approved by the Director wherein it was :
recommended that we commence the interrogation
of the Soviet illegal agent.

The interrogation was commenced by
Agents of our New York Office during the afternoon
of 4~9-63 and has been going on intermittently
since then, Of course, she does not know that the
Agents are connected with the FBI.

During the interrogation and as a
result of the search incidental thereto, we
have uncovered the following: 1. Her one-time
cypher pad, 2, $4,000 given to her by the

: Soviets, 3. Her secret writing material.
4. Her fraudulent American passport.

While she has made some admissions,
we have not yet been able to obtain a complete
statement from her concerning her training
and activities as an illegal Soviet agent,

‘ It is believed that through intermittent
interrogation over a period of several days or

a week, we will get this information from her
and it should be most valuable. - a

It is, thdtedre, ‘proposed that.we take .

Her to a Safe house at. Bear Mountain where. sne~—---’-
wil kept under our c6éptrol, and where the
int¢xnogation can pretéed under conditions 03. .

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. SULLIVAN
RE: GLEKE :

She has expressed a willingness for
this. In view of her illegal status in the US
and her position as a Soviet agent, we are
justified in taking this action.

‘eet

Through intermittent interrogation
over a period of time, a fey days or a week as
has been done in the past with other Soviet
illegals, we can anticipate getting her full
story, and this, as has been noted, should be
valuable to us.

If at the end of that time she is not
completely cooperative we can then consider
other alternative steps which can be taken.

For example, we can then consider
turning her over to the Soviet Mission to the
United Nations (SHUN), presenting her as one
of their illegal agents uncovered in the US,

If they refuse to accept her, we might escort
her to a plane en route to the Soviet Union.

Of course, we would arrange to have photographs
taken of her when we present her to the SUN

and photographs taken of her being placed aboard
a plane destined outside the US, These, together
with other photos that we have of her actua.
operations in the US, would make a very interesting
story and could be very damaging to the Soviets,
However, just-which course of action we arrive
at will depend upon developments during the
interview.

ACTION:

———

If you agree, we will proceed in line
with the above, at :

‘ “ESPIONAGE ~ R

This case involves a Soviet female illegal agent in
New York City who has been under interrogation by New York Agents
since 4/9/63.

Our New York Office advises that subject haw furnished
the complete story of her life and activities here and from the
information previously available to us concerning her, it appears
that she is telling the truth. New York Agents characterize her as a
very intelligent person with good educational background equivalent
to that of a Ph.D. Prior to her intelligence activities she was in
the Soviet diplomatic service for a number of years and is very proud
of her service for the Soviets and for that reason she insists she
will never reveal to the Soviets her cooperation with us in order to
protect her career. z

She advises she is scheduled to return to the Soviet Union
around May 1 and that she will continue her cooperation with us until
her return, Further, that if she ever comes back to this country or
is given an assignment in another country, she is a potential “to
cooperate in furnishing information. U

In order to allay any suspicions on the part of the
Soviets of her cooperation and in order for her to keep certain
commitments with friends of hers in this country, it is believed
necessary she return to her apartment in the Bronx until her departure
for the Soviet Union. - She has promised she will continue to meet
with New York Agents regularly until that time and cooperate fully.

New York Office strongly recommends that this be done.
In view of her cooperation and her promise to continue this
cooperation, it is believed desirable that she be returned to her
apartment at this time.
