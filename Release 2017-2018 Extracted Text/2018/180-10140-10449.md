7) The CIA's written statement replying to the committee's

request of February 21, 1978 for an expianation of

the

criteria that governed the opening of a 201 file dur-

ing the years 1958-64 was not responsiva to our inguiry

because the CIA's written statement did not focus on the

relevant time period.

accordingly, I am renewing our

request of February 21, 1978. Imthe event that there

were no criteria governing the opening a such files

auring that period, the committee would appreciate a

written statement indicating that this was the cass

CIA document #563-810 indicates that there are 37 docu-

ments that should be in lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file

but which are missing fron the file.

Furthermore, this

document also indicates that there should be a machine

listing of these documents attached as part of document

#563-810, but no such listing appears in the file. The

Select Committee on Assassinations requests that the

CIA provide a listing of such documents as well as a

written explanation of where those documents are 10-

cated and

why they do not appear in Oswald's 201 file.

Pursuant to my letter of December 27, 1977, I would like

to note that the document referred to in this paragraph

is a classified document.

water having reviewed both the documents contained in

the BIA's files on Priscilla Johnson MoMillan änd the

which were made available to the Committee did not in-

clude HTLINGUAL materials. As the Committee

has

already requested all information contained in your

files on the individuals who are the subjects of out

requests, please review the files that you have pre-

viously made available to us for the purpose of ensur

ing that all of the information pertaining io the

individuals involved has, in fact, been provide
