. 4 Venezuelan Christian Democratic friend of mine, Valmore
Acevedo, called me..from New Yor City yesterday morning to ask
as.a personal favor-that.I receive a Cuban exile living there

skepticism, Acevedo urgently repeated his request and 1 agreed,
Within-a surprisingly-short time the Cuban,. Victor Zspinosa, -
arrived at my office (he said he had taken. the plane immedi-..
ately). Sspinosa gave-his address and telephone aumber as

1 for many -years,, .He opposed. Batista and opposes vastro,, lie is
not a-member oZ the March.13 Movement, but has long been very
close-to many of its-leaders, including Cubelas. Espinosa was
trained. by CIA, in both Louisiana and Guatemala, and was one
of those who was sent-into Cuba prior to the Bay of gs. He
plans to become an American citizen in Augus¢ of cais year.
He admires the United. States and American strength and compe=
tence in many fields. He asked a New York acquaintenance of
his for the name of someone in the Department iavolved in
Latin American affairs, . He.waa told Acevedo kmew such an

ial. Espinosa asked Acevedo (without, 1

vealing his story), and the latter called me.

13/9


in Spain (which Espinosa entered illegeily), Espinosa was in-
formed that there is a plan to-overthrow the Castro regime

and to kill Castro and some of his main leaders, The plot is
led by Cubeleg and some of the March 13 Movement, plus (I be-
lieve) some military officers, They must move very quickly
because-more and more people are learning of the plot and
there-is growing risk of exposure. They are anxious to have
some coordination, or at leaet consultation, with responsible
Americans, .: They are not confident: that they could win an all-
out fight against the Castro forces, and are thinking more in
terms of taking control for a short time (perhaps only a few
hours), -killing Castro and his most effective men (thes
ruining the Castro movement forever), end then trying to hold
out .for as long as feasible, . It is essentiel that they know
what, if anything, the Americans might -do to help, now end/or
later, when the-coup is. attempted. Also, they wished to alert
the United States Government to what was being planned,

ene The Cubans: might have turned t the CIA
men infaddes ~ However, they belie’ is completely
unreliable, A Cuban_girl-ywas sent to Madrid some time ago by
the Castro: people, te fee fooled by her and, being
very fond of women, s@€ Hey up in an apartment in Madrid, He
eiso arranged for her to-work with the International Rescue
Committee, -When the proper moment came,* four months ego, she
flew back to Havana with some very-useful files, In these
circumstances. the-Cuban-plotters have no confidence whatever
 cn| They urgently asked Espinosa to be their go-
between with reliable American officials. The “top security"
wan returned to Havana, while one representative of the
plotters waited in Spain for an answer,

~~ Espinosa hurriedly returned ‘to New York City. He celled
O'Brien of the New York FBI to ask that the letter arrange for

-his to talk with some serious and relieble man from Cia,

O'Brien did so, Espinosa then told the foregoing story, end
more, to a CIA men named "Hal", Hal impressed Espinose 2s
being intelligent and reliable, Espinoge understands thet Kal
ox someone else went to Spain to check on his story, Ata
events, Espinosa wes assured CIA understood the urgency of
metter and that he would be called within a few days. A vee

running out, Espinoca's friends in Paris keep calling him,
ceutiously asking whether there has been some "response",

but Espinosa has had to keep putting them off, Meanwiile,
the Cuban who was waiting in Spain for the answer has had to
return, Espinosa keeps waiting to hear whether the Americans
will play ball with the Cubelag “group, The plot has lasted
for over 18 months, and the plotters plan to 29 ahead very
soon no matter whether the Americans “play ball" or not, One
reagon is that they almost have to go ahead now, for the plot
will soon be discovered and then it will be entirely hopeless.

Espinosa also referred to a jeweler by the name of
TeppelZino (spelling?), located at 47th Street, in New York
City, TeppedZino works for CIA and has frequent contact with
the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris, The Ambassador regularly dis~
poses of jewelry and other valuables made available from Cuba.
He does this through Teppéliino. However, the latter fools
CIA. , For exemple, the Ambassador agrees to sell for $80,000.
Teppeliino informs CIA the price is $110,000, and quietly
pockets the difference. On the other hand, Teppeldino and
CIA think the Cuben Ambassador does not know he is working for
CIA, but _the Ambassador does know,

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dangerous
situation of the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level
official in the United States Government unless he receives
at least some reply from CIA.

Comment:

Espinosa was not overly tense and did not indulge in his~
trionics, but I felt he was quite determined to push this
matter further if he did not get some response within the very
near future. I cannot, and do not have to, judge his reli-
ability on the basis of this one conversation, However, if
had to guess at this point I would be inclined to accept mo:
cf what he said about actual events. But of course there
all sorts of cbvious possibilities, including provocation,
