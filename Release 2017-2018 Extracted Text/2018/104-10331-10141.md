(U) The Presidential Assassination Review Board staff

has asked to read the subject document for possible

relevance to their work, for the period covering June 1962

to December 1964.

We have selected the attached segments as

falling within the bounds of their request.

We would like you to obtain permission from the IG

In the unlikely event that we are

requested to declassify the documents for the assassination

further review. â€¢ As you know the staffers we deal with are

fully cleared.
