Cuban-American

In Book V of the final report of the Senate Select
Committee to Study Governmental Operations on the performance
of the intelligence agencies in the investigation of the
assassination, the FBI and CIA are criticized for their
apparent failure to fully pursue leads surrounding the
assassination of President Kennedy and then to fully report
to the Warren Commission the results of the investigations
they did undertake. One such lead concerned the travel
from Texas to Mexico City of apronidentiflea Cuban-

American on November 23, 1963, and then his flight to Havana on
November 27. 1/ The lead was made more "interesting" by

the fact that the Cuban-American reportedly attended a

meeting of the Tampa chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba
Committee on November 17, 1963. 2/ The House Select

Committee on Assassinations examined the documents connected

to that lead to determine: . (a) whether the facts which were
known by the FBI .and CIA about that individual warranted
further investigation and what investigation was undertaken;
(b) whether any of that information was reported to the Warren
Commission; and (c). whether the known facts suggest any. ia

involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy.

The first information on the travel of the Cuban-

American appeared em, December 1963. At that time the
Mexico Station of the CIA sent a classified. message
to CIA headquarters that a source @entified asfLIremro/4) had
requested of the Mexico City Chief of Station at 1300 hours
on that date “urgent traces on U.S. citizen-Gilberto P.

Lopez.”

3/ The source said Lopez arrived in Mexico on
November 23 en route to Havana and that Lopez had
disappeared with no record of his’ trip to Havana. According
to the message, Lopez had a tourist card,carrying number
24553, which he obtained in Tampa on November 20, 1963 and
his passport number was 310162. The message stated that Lopez
left Mexico for Havana, on Novenber 27 via Cubana (Airlines) -
The classified message listed the eryptonym(LIFrRE)as cha cre'pict

which had been carried out in Key West, Florida. The report

stated that Lopez's counsin, Guillermo Serpa Rodriguez, told the
FBI that Lopez came to the United Stated for the first time some
time after Castro first came to power. 27/ He stayed approximately
one year and then returned to Cuba. 28/ Rodriguez stated that
Lopez returned to Cuba because he was homesick and missed

his family; he had parents and four brothers who still resided

in Cuba. 29/

Rodriguez stated also that Lopez's brother Selito was
a member of the Cuban militia at that time. 30/ Another
brother, Raimundo Policarpo Lopez, had reportedly been
sent to the Soviet Union to study by the Cuban government,
according to Rodriguez. 31/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez returned to the United
States in 1960 or 1961 because he was afraid he would be drafted
into the Cuban militia if he remained in Cuba. 32/

The FBI learned that Lopez married an American woman in Key
West in August, 1962. 33/ According to Lopez's wife, he worked
for a time with the Pepsi Cola Co. in 1962 and at ‘the Molina
and Murgia Bakery in Key West, which was owned by cousins. 34/
She said that he also worked for a construction company in

Tampa in. June, 1963. 35/


Cuban-American...page 8

Lopez's wife told the FBI that Lopez began suffering from
recurrent attacks of epilepsy and had to be confined at Jackson
State Hospital in--Key-West in early 1963. 36/ She stated that
he was treated by doctors from Coral Gables and Key West for the
epilepsy. 37/ She stated that she did not believe he had a
history of epilepsy before coming to the United States. 38/

She believed his convulsions were brought on by nervous tension
and worry over his family in Cuba and may have been a reason
for his return to Cuba in 1963. 39/

The wife said that in approximately November, 1963,
she received a letter from Lopez saying he had returned to
Cuba. 40/ The wife stated that she was surprised he had returned
but that he had mentioned he was going back to Cuba when he
left for Tampa in November, 1963. 41/ The wife gave her opinion
that he returned because of his close relationship with his
parents. 42/ The wife stated that she received another letter
from him later from Cuba. 43/ According to the letter, he was
working as an elevator operator in Havana. 44/ In that letter
Lopez said he had received some kind of financial assistance
for the trip from an organization in Tampa. 45/ ‘According to the
wife, Lopez did not have sufficient personal funds to pay the
expenses to Mexico and Cuba. 46/ She said that he had never had

contact with Cuban refugee organizations to her knowledge. 47/


Cuban-American...page 9

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez left Key West
in late 1963 to go to Tampa with the hope of being able
to return to Cuba. 48/ Rodriguez said he believed Lopez wanted
‘to return to Cuba because he was afraid of being drafted into
the U.S. military. 49/ Rodriguez said Lopez was not involved
in any pro-Castro activity while living in Key West, but that
Lopez was’ "definitely" pro-Castro. 50/ Rodriguez recounted that
in one instance he and Lopez actually had a fist-fight over
Lopez's pro-Castro sympathies. 51/

In a report in March 1962, the FBI reported that Lopez
had attended a meeting of the Tampa Pair Play for Cuba Committee
on November 20, ake. 52/ The report also stated that at a
meeting of the group on November 17, 1963, Lopez stated that he
had been refused travel back to Cuba. He said at that time
that he was waiting for a phone call from Cuba to get word on
his departure to Cuba. 53/

According to that report in March, 1964, a member of the
Tampa FPCC stated that she called a friend in Cuba on December a
1963 and. was told that ‘Lopez had arrived safely. 54/. The emp
had attempted to locate topey in Cuba through friends there because
Lopez had not delivered gifts to persons in Cuba from people ul
in Florida as he had promised to do. 55/ The member stated
also that the Tampa chapter of the FPCC had given Lopez
approximately $190 for the réturn trip to Cuba. 56/ The member
said that Lopez had gone to Cuba by way of Mexico because he did

not have a passport. 57/


* Cuban-Americen...page 10

The March 1964 FBI report listed Lopez's passport as
#310162, which had been issued in January, 1960, and his
Mexican tourist card as "M8-24553, issued November 20, 1963.
in Tampa. 58/ It stated that Lopez entered Mexico by private
auto at Nuevo Laredo on November 23, 1963 and departed for
Havana on November 27 as the only passenger on a Cubana flight,
carrying a Cuban courtesy visa. 59/
According to the FBI file, Lopez's mother, Esperanza
Rodriguez, was born in Key West, Florida. 60/ The file
listed three cousins and four uncles who resided and worked in
the Key West area with their families. 61/
Lopez's FBI file contains a memo from the Tampa office
dated October 26, 1964 which states:
It is felt that information developed
regarding the subject is not sufficient
to merit consideration for the Security
Index. 62/
The only information transmitted by the FBI to the Warren
Commission on Lopez concerned a check at the Passport Office. 63/

Tne information the Bureau did send to the Commission a bout the -

Tampa chapter of the FPCC did not include any information on

Lopez's activities. 64/ The CIA apparently did not provide
any information on Lopez to the Warren Commission. As pointed

out in the Senate report, this omission is made more egregious

by the fact that sources had reported within a few days of

Lopez's departure for Havena and off the assassination that the

circumstances surrounding his travel seemed "suspicious"

and

the CIA repeated the FBI's conclusion that he had traveled

had no other means of investigating Lopez at his disposal
and had carried the lead as far as it was able by

questioning a Cuban defector about Lopez. While the fact

of the CIA's lack of access to further information about

Lopez may well be the case, that fact does not explain either
the failure of the CIA to take-more seriously the suspicions

exactly that kind of information.

From the information collected by the FBI, there

appear to be weki-exsieined reasons both for Lopez's
desire to return to Cuba and his solicitation of the help of a
local FPCC chapter for that travel. His contacts in Florida
appear on their face to be innocent and-nempotttieah and not Ea
in any way connected with the assassination. .Despite the
suggestion by the Senate report of suspicion in the fact
that Oswald "may" have been in touch with that same FPCC

ths HICA hunch
chapter, ,no evidence appsazs to suggest that Oswald was

actually in touch with the Tampa FPCC, or that Lopez was

connected in any way with Oswald or Dallas.


Cuban-American...page 14

Despite what is now known about Lopéz, the Warren
Commission may well have wanted to lay to rest
suspicions which would eM about Lopez, and satisfy
itself that these circumstances in no way indicate foreign
involvement in the assassination. The CIA has contributed
to those suspicions by not airing the matter and explaining
circumstances which could shed light on otherwise sinister
appearing events.

The Committee has documented instances where the CIA
decided to forego passing information to.the Warren Commission
out of a desire to not lay bare extremely sensitive sources
and methods of intelligence. the (LrFrrE operation
certainly falls within that category and as soon as the CIA
began receiving information that(n1FTRE)was the source of
the information about Lopez's travel, the cables and
messages reflected the desire to not reveal that method.

It also seems plausible that the FBI likewise chose not to

divulge what it had learned about Lopez because in doing

so, it- would have had to reveal the sensitive CIA operation
which generated the initial information on Lopez's travel to Cuba

on November 27.
