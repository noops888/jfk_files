ACT - INVESTIGATIVE MATTER

On September 24, 1964, a source of the Pittsburgh
Office, who is active in Teamster Union affairs locally,
advised Special Agents Damon W,. Pitcher and John S. Portella
that Local 249, International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
Pittsburgh, is voting on September 27, 1964, on the
ratification of a contract with A & P and that both the
company and the union's officials are obviously working
to gain a favorable vote.

In this connection, source advised that James
Halbert, Pittsburgh District Supervisor of Transportation
and Warehousing for A & P, residence address 220 Orchard
Drive, Pittsburgh 35, Pa., has stated that the negotiations
on a national level have been conducted in New York City
between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and a
labor consultant firm which is representing.the A & P,
Two of the negotiators for the A & P are a Mr. Avery and a
Mr. Lewis. He stated that the labor consultant firm is
actually owned by "Tony Pro" (Anthony Provenzano, prominent
New Jersey Teamster Union official) and that during the last
week of the Hoffa trial in Chicago, Avery and Lewis were
vacationing in Connecticut and were summoned to New York
where they met with "Tony Pro" in regard to the pending
negotiations.

From other sources, the source has learned that
Jimmy Hoffa, International Brotherhood of Teamsters President,
desires ratification of the A & P contract and, at the same
time that Avery and Lewis were in New York City, Tom Fagan,
President of Local 249, was summoned to Chicago where he
mét with Hoffa and an A & P representative from the East in
connection with ways of obtaining the desired ratification.

Subsequently, in the same connection, Fagan has made two
trips to New York City without divulging their purpose to
anyone. Fagan is most desirous of pleasing Hoffa in this
regard because. Harry Tevis, Third International Vice-President
of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a Pittsburgh

‘ resident, is slated for removal from office by either
voluntary or involuntary means, and Fagan is the leading
contender to be his replacement.

The source stated that the current grocery
warehouse strike situation in California is the result of
rank and file rebellion in opposition to the new A & P
contract.

In a contact with the source on October 5, 1964,
he advised that at the time Halbert mentioned the trip to
New York by Avery and Lewis he commented "We finally got
around to fighting you guys with one of your own guys.

We got Tony Pro's boys working for us." He does not recall
that Halbert disclosed the name of the labor consultant
firm employed by A & P, but described the firm only as
"Tony Pro's firm." During subsequent contacts with Halbert
he has been unable to determine the identity of the
consultant firm,

The source advised that Hoffa is endeavoring to
establish a national contract, that he has achieved his
goal within the "Central Conference," and is endeavoring
to obtain a similar contract in the East. The source
explained that. the voting on September 27, 1964, by members
of Local. 249 related to a national contract in that a
failure to approve the proposed contract with A & P locally
would result, in their teing subjected to the terms of a
national contract similar to the one negotiated in other
sections of the country. Reportedly Fagan told members
of Teamsters Local 249 that if their negotiations on a
local contract with A & P at Pittsburgh were unsuccessful
they, would be forced to accept the terms of a national contract.

We got TONY PRO's boys working for us." Informant stated
he did not recall that HALBERT disclosed the name of the
consultant firm and said he described it only as "TONY
PRO's firm." HALBERT also mentioned that AVERY and LEWIS,
who are negotiators representing A & P, reportedly were
ealled to New York City to confer with the labor consultant
