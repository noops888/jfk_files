H 1. On 19 December 1961, this Agency became aware of

i ||. Some-aspects 6f the incident described in referenced reports.

According to our records, this was the third overflight of this
kind attempted. Cn 21 Cctober 1961, a leaflet drop was apparently
made over Camaguey, Cuba by U.S, citizens. On 8-9 December
1961, authorities at Nassau intercepted and stopped a plane and
U.S, citizens preparing to conduct a similar leaflet drop over
Guba. On the weekend of 15-17 December, another overflight
was conducted by U.S. citizens and from this attempt, two

: pilots and a plane failed to return.

2, Investigation by U.S. authorities of the activities
cited above has been hampered by a welter of conflicting stories
from second and third hand sources, as well as by inconsistent
statements from alleged participants. However, the following
summary appears to be accurate, William JOHNSON has eaid
that he, Kobert SWANNER, and Frank FIORINI made the 2l
October overflight. Alexander I RORKE, a free-lance newsman
and photographer who has long been on the fringes of Cuban exile
activity, has claimed that he flew on this miesion as an observer.
On 8 December, Robert SWANNER was intercepted in Nassau in

Lauderdale, SWANNER was met in Nassau by JOHNSON, RORKE,
and.FIORINI, This group tried to get a permit to fly to Great
Exuma Island, but the permit was denied; the plane impounded,
and SWANNER fined $500, 00 for illegal entry inasrauch as he had
no authorization to fly the plane outside the U.S. On 10 December,

. |= a-search of Norman Cay produced nine packages of anti-Castro

leaflets: similar to the ones used in the 21 October operation.
On 14 December, THOMPSON flew from Melbourne, Florida to
Fort Lauderdale in an Apache aircraft, No. 2062P, belonging to
his employer, J. David FINGER, and allegedly chartered by
JOHNSCN for an eventual flight to Nassau. In Fort Lauderdale,
‘THOMPSON picked up JOHNSON, It is not clear whether SWANNER
and FIORINI were picked up in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, or West
Palm Beach, but it is certain that at some point JOHNSON left
the group ard that FIORINI, SWANNER and THOMPSON flew to
Andros Island, On the evening of 17 December, FINGER reported
to the FAA at Melbourne thet Apache No, 2062P, with THOMPSON
as pilot, ‘was missing, On 18 Decomber, RORKE, FIORINI, and
JOHNSON reportedly chartered 2 plane in Miami for a trip to
=Bimini and Cay Sal. RORKE allegedly identified himself as a
CBS photographer looking for photographs of pink flamingos.
The plane flew a criss-cross pattern over Cay Sal and returned
to Miami International Airport. There has been no information
concerning the whereabouts of THOMPSON, SWANNER and Apache
No, 2062P until March 1963, when the atory attributed to an
wnidentified Cuban farmer appeared in the referenced preas items,

3... Aa to the question of CIA involvement in the activities
of the men cited herein, JOHNSON, FIORINI, and RORKE have,
at-various times, claimed CIA sponsorship, although RORKE and
FIORINI also intimated that they themselves were the sponsors,

Sergio ROTAS Santamarina, CASTRO's Ambassador to London from
1959 until June 1960, at which time ROJAS broke with CASTRO
because of conviction of the latter's communist orientation,
appears to have been the Cuban exile sponsoring the operations.

7 ope:

[ Infact, none of these men had any sponsorship by CLA whatsoever.

Although this Agency supported| for certain operations
of an entirely different nature, ‘rations or anything con-
nected with them were not included. The policy which guided this

. “Agency during the months in question permitted a great deal of
latitude in dealing with Cuban exiles and, although little or no

* Control over their activities was demanded, the authorization,
funding, and conduct of air operations against Cuba by this

‘Agency were specifically forbidden. It is quite likely that
ROJAS, in his zeal to strike effective blows against the CASTRO
regime, and despite thie Agency's repeated expressions of dis~
interest in air operations, convinced at least RORKE and FIORINI
that leaflet drops were sanctioned by CIA, About one week before

:, the October overflight and about one week before the December
incident, CIA-began to receive reports of impending leaflet

~ dxops.over Cuba, As noted above, after the 21 October opera
tion, RORKE and FIORINI claimed that they had been involved.
It was not until December that this Agency became aware of the
fall extent of the three overflights and the details of the involve-
ment of THOMPSON, SWANNER, and JOHNSON, With the
exception of| none of the men mentioned herein have
ever been employed by this Agency in any capacity.

4, In March 1962, Mr. Raymond J. DWYER, a Miami
attorney representing FINGER in connection with possible
litigation against the insurer of the Apache aircraft, approached
this Agency for information inasmuch ae there were widespread
rumors of U. S..Government involvement in the incident. Mr.
DWYER was informed that this Agency had no connection with
the flight in question ar with the individuals named by him -
FINGER, JOHNSON, THOMPSON, SWANNER, and STURGIS (Frank
Anthony STURGIS aka Frank FIORINI).

5. In June, 1962, this Agency received from the State
Department a query from Senator Robert C. BYRD on behalf of
Mrs. Blanche DeBOLT, Elkview, West Virginia, mother of
Robert THOMPSON, Mrs. DeBOLT was seeking clarification
of various rumors concerning THOMPSON's whereabouts. This
Agency informed State that we had no information that would
substantiate any of the rumors,

: 6. This Agency has checked the transcripts of CASTRO's
8peeches from 14 through 31 December 1961. He made no refer-

_ ence to: having shot down two aircraft which were dropping bombs
and leaflets on Havana and Matanzas. As to other elements of
the incident as reported in references, this Agency can furnish
no information on the following:

A. Mrs. SWANNER's story of having driven
SWANNER, JOHNSON, and FIORINI to Fort Lauder-
dale to load a boat with leaflets;

f B, The $500, 60 checks reportedly given to

Mrs,-SWANNER and Mra. THOMPSON by FIORINI;

C. Mra, SWANNER's reported trip to Andros
“ Yeland with her aon and a friend of her husband;

an i D. The mysterious phone calls to Mrs. SWANNER,
Mrs, THOMPSON, and others;

“ E. The role of Gene ASBURY and Norman
GRATSKY or GRADSKY,

7,. ‘The John MARTINO mentioned in one of the referenced
articles is probably John Vincent MARTINO who was sentenced by
Cuban authorities in 1959 to thirteen years in prison on the charge
of counter-revolutionary activities. MARTINO was released and
returned to the U.S. in October 1962, not in December as
‘reported. MARTINO wae not and is not Cais by this Agency
in any capacity.
