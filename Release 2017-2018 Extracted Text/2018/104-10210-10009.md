INTRODUCTION

The following summary and analysis is not intended to be
all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi-

zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished

by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO. To attempt to do so would be repetitious

and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the
formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of
primary concern.

This summary will not contain a detailed psychological
assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain’a recitation of the numerous
theories which have been-promulgated in the past concerning varying
aspects of the NOSENKO case, This summary will be primarily
directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was not
dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively
plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been coopérative in
a reassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO

has-admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that ©

these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance

: “SECRET: : ioe

F

’

but not to mislead this Agency in any material matters of an operational
or policy nature.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding of the phrase "bona
fides" as considered in this summary, NOSENKO will be judged primarily
on whether he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB knowledge,
and whether his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this
Agency were known to the KGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent
aspects will be considered, but his admitted previous errors, lies and
exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion: that NOSENKO is not a
“ena fide" defector.

There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement
against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or
correlated to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer. For
purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas
considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may differ in regard to
whether this arbitrary standard is a completely accurate standard, but it
is felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from other
sources derived through independent investigation will permit the reader
to assess the information.in toto against any standard he considers

appropriate.

nation of the Bona Fides of a SE Defector," has been considered in

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN NOSENKO CASE

SINCE 30 OCTOBER 1967 : EE

Since 30 October 1967, interviews with Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

have been conducted by one individual not previously known personally to
NOSENKO but who has been aware of the NOSENKO case since June 1962.

Interviews have been detailed and very extensive in scope, have
been recorded and transcribed, and have covered the entire life and careez
of NOSENKO without regard to whether a particular aspect had been.
covered during previous interview or interviews,

NOSENKO, although naturally apprehensive during the first few
interviews, has been cooperative, has developed a relaxed attitude, and
the interviewer has noted no significant reluctance to discuss any aspect
of hia life, career, or activities. On occasion NOSENKO has indicated a
reluctance to maxe positive statements in certain areas previously
considered ata minimum extremely controversial, This reluctance

was understandable and when it became apparent to NOSENKO that the i

SECRET ° |

deurict

interviewer would not dispute or disparage his statements without adequate
reason, this reluctance on the part of NOSENKO, in the opinion of the
interviewer, totaiiy disappeared.

During the interviewing period, particularly in the first six months,
NOSENKO materially assisted the interviewer by preparing approximately
sixty memoranda on such diverse subjects as his life, motivation for de-
fection, individual cases, notes which he furnished to CIA in 1964, KGB
organization, and KGB officer and agent personalities. As an example
of the scope of this work by NOSENKO, four of the memoranda included

ob.
remarke concerning approximately [875|KGB officers, [LOO}KGB agents,
9 —-35/GRU officera, and[A0dlother Soviet nationals. These liste were alpha-
betically arranged and the above indicated cooperation of NOSENKO has
materially assisted in the organization and evaluation of information
furnished by him during current interviews.
Copies of transcripts of interviews with NOSENKO and related
memoranda have been disseminated to the FBI and the Cl Staff. Special

Agent Elbert Turner and Special Agent James Wooten of the Washington

Field Office/FBI in particular have given great assistance in research

and compilation of new or additional information and the FBI has inter-

viewed or reinterviewed a number of United States citizens concerning

whom NOSENKO has furnished pertinent information,

In addition, throe professionals from the $B Divieton have
reviewed tha current information and assisted In the retrieval of
previous information from NOSENKO and collation of current
information with previous informath-a, The latter is a tremendous
task because of the volume of material; the number of individual
cases involved; and the extensive information in regard to KGB
personalities, procedures, organizational structure end activities.

The 8B Diviston elso provided the services of an expert
translator to translate the tapes of the 1965 interrogation of HOSENK
by Petr DERYABIN and one of the previcuely mentioned three pro-
fenpionala completed a new translation of the 1962 interviews with
NOSENKO. In addition, transcriptions of certain other particularly
pertinent previous interviews of NOSENKO have boon completed by
the Office of Security.

Approximately 7000 pages of transcripts and related material
have been compiled and disseminated since Inte October 1967. Com-
iments concerning the value of the information contained in the above
material are contained in another section of this cummary. Ao of the
present thne, a completo analysis is not posatble since a considerable
portion of the material has not been fally processed. In tha proparation

of this summary all areas of major significance have been examined.

YURIY IVANOVICH NOSENKO

As indicated in the irtroduction to thie summary, information in
regard to Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO will be considered against an arbi-
trary but realistic list of areas considered pertinent to the question of
whether NOSENKO voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB

knowledge, and whether his, 1962/and early 1964 contacts with represent-

" atives of this Agency were known to the KGB.

It was noted that motivation and certain other pertinent aspects

‘dls be considered but that his admitted previous lies and exag-

wou!
gerations would not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a
"bona. fide defector,"

The following is a list of the areas considered pertinent and which
are being given specific consideration, Attached is a separate section
containing remarks in regard to the designated areas of A - H.

A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims

ete ; to be? :

B. . Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible?

zation reasonably commensurate with his claimed KGB

career?

Can the information furnished by NOSENKO be con-
sidered in toto as having resulted in material damage

to the KGB and/or has the information furnished by
NOSENKO been of significant benefit to Western Intelli-
gence? “ i

Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in
information furnished by. NOSENKO which would warrant
a conclusion that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB?

Is there any evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO

during these contacts or after his defection?

og



A. _Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims to be?

During interviews NOSENKO has furnished detailed information in regard
to his family, his activities as a youth, the schools he attended, assoc-
jates of his father and rhother, and his own associates, The period
under consideration in this section is the period preceding his. entry
into the First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-
March 1953,

Information furnished by NOSENKO concerning his father and

mother and his early. life, together with other information such as a

_comparison of photographs of NOSENKO and a photograph of his father

and confirmed travel of his mother to Western Europe in 1956 with

_ Madame KOSYGINA, conclusively establish that he. is Yuriy Ivanovich

NOSENKO, the son of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, the Minister of Ship-
building in the USSR prior to hig death in 1956. This is also satisiactorily .
supported by personal-type information furnished by NOSENKO concern-
ing other associates of his father and mother.

Since, as indicated above, there is considered to be no doubt

that Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO is the son of the former Minister of

Shipbuilding, a detailed study of his life prior to 1945 {age 18) is of

. G0UL026



oe

ittle or no value in assessing te bona fides or non-bona fides of

NOSENKO. An expose of his youthful

indiscretions, of which he has

|
admitted a number, is of no import in a discussion of whether NOSENKO |
|

|

was or was not dispatched by the KGB, Obtaining any coilaterai dirst- |
|

hand information in regard to NOSENKO before 1945 would be of

negligible value, but there actually is supporting information from

Nikolay ARTAMONOY, a defector from the Soviet Navy, concerning

the claimed attendance by NOSENXO at a military-naval preparatory

school in Leningrad.
NOSENKO, during current interviews, has stated that he grad-
ry uated from the Institute of International Relations in 1950 and had
attended the Institute since 1945. He has explained that he shouid have 4 a
graduated in 1949’since it was a four-year course, but failed the iinal \
examination in Marxiem and therefore was required to attend the Institute
for a longer period of time and again take his final examinations. H
Based on information furnished by NOSENKO concerning co-
students and the Institute, there is no reason to doubt that he actually
attended and graduated from the Institute of International Relations in
1950, The previous controversy in this matter was complicated by
NOSENKO who, in 1964 after his defection, stated in a biography that

- he had graduated from the Institute in 1949, Actually this statement

0001027



” evidence’ that NOSENKO was dispatched by ‘the KGB. | It'is

by NOSENKO in 1964 resulted in conflicting information since NOSENKO
on 9 June 1962 during his first contact with CIA had stated that he
"completed the Institute of International Relations in 1950." NOSENKO
has given the explanation that he changed the date of hie graduation to
1949 because he did not wish to admit that he had failed to graduate in
1949. NOSENKO explained that this change in his date of graduation
caused him to pre-date his actual entry into Navy Intelligence to 1950
instead of 1951 and his actual entry into the KGB from 1953 to 1952.

The above action by NOSENKO is included in what NOSENKO has
characterized as hie "stupid blunders." The latter is a rather apt:

characterization of his now admitted lies and exaggerations but is not

evidence of

a certain personality trait of NOSENKO who has in the past by his own
admission tended to enhance his importance and astuteness by graphically
portraying his personal participation in KGB activities concerning which
he had knowledge but did not personally participate, .
The claimed service of NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence during
March 1951 to early 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas has been

seriously questioned in the past. Specific comments on this period of

time are contained in a separate section of this summary, but it is

considered that the recent interviews of NOSENKO satisfactorily sub-
stantiate his claimed service in Navy Intelligence during March 1951
to early 1953.

Attached is a typed copy of a handwritten memorandum completed
by NOSENKO on 31 October 1967, This is a biographical statement con-
cerning his life and KGB caretr, No effort has been made to correct
grammatical errors or spelling since to do so would be in conflict with

the manner in which current interviews were conducted; namely, to give

NOSENKO an opportunity to recount his life.and activities to permit a re-
examination of the entire case. The comprehension and fluency of
NOSENKO in the English language was adequate for interview purposes

in October 1967 and both have materially improved since that time,

Interviews of and memoranda prepared by. NOSENKO since

"31 October 1967 have not indicated any material discrepancies with the

statements of a in the attached memorandum, One change that
has-been made by NOSENKO is that he now dates his transfer from the
First Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, to the Seventh
Department, SCD, as occurring in the latter part of May 1955 rather
than June - July 1955 as indicated in the attached statement. NOSENKO

also now dates the period in which an unsatisfactory "characterization"

In summer 1945 there was created the institute of the inter
national relations in Moscow and in July I entered in this institute.

In Suly my father went in Germany with the group of engineers
and he took me (I received a temporary rank ea senior lieutenant,
documents and a uniform).

i In-1945-1950 I studied at the institute. In 1946 I acquainted -

with a girl.- Shishkov FLAVIA, student of the medicine insiiure. I

wae.in close relcfione with this girl, because of the pregnancy i married
her and she made an abort, My parents were against the marriage and

we did not live together and we soon divorced. In the end of 1946 I was

acquai nted with Telegin AUGUSTINE and.was going to marry her, re~
ceived a flat in 1947 (St.. Mira - former Ist Uecyehekad, 162/174), In

November her father, General TELEGIN, was arrested, but lmarried

her. The marriage was not successiul, I foundout about her close
relations with the brother, and the child-girl was born with pathological
changes. Iwas not the father of this child, After that 1 broke with her
and we were living separately (end of 1948 - beginning 1949).

In spring 1950 before state exams in the institute was working

his KGB career today is not significantly different from the fragmentary!

Basically the following is now considered to have been the KGB

of Department and in generi)} has supervisory functions over all the

Department sections. The exception to the latter is when the Chief of

Department retains direct supervision over what hé may consider the |
most important section, Other deputies. have supervisory functions only
over designated sections or organizational components. )

During current interviews and in prepared memoranda, NOSENKO ‘

+, 4,/.,/as. furnished detailed information which it is considered substantiates

his. claimed positions in the KGB. . Detailed remarks on these topics are
contained in separate sections of this summary.

It is realized that GOLITSYN, although confirming that NOSENKO
was a KGB officer in both the First Department and Seventh Department,
SCD, has stated that NOSENKO: remained in the First Department until
circa 1958 and that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief of the First Section,
First Department, in 1960, It is impossible to correlate this information
with the above indicated opinion that NOSENKO left the First Department fate
“in late May 1955 and wae Deputy Chief of the First Section, First Depart-

ment, in 1960, nor is an adequate explanation of these variances available

gouLc45

at this time. On the other hand, it is not reasonable that NOSENKO a
would lay claim to the title of Deputy Chief of the First Section, First
Department, if this were not true when he clearly knew of the visits of
GOLITSYN to the First Section in 1960 - 1961 and of his conferences
with officers closely associated with NOSENKO at that time. ;
NOSENKO has also mentioned a number of officers of the SCD
or former officers of the SCD who transferred to the FCD with whom
he wae personally acquainted and who were also known to GOLITSYN. |
A number of these officers were officers from whom GOLITSYN has
stated he obtained certain information or through whom he became pene

GRYAZNOV, Vladimir Ivanovich PETROV, Yuriy 1. GUX, Vladimir
A. CHURANOV, Yevgeniy GROMAKOVSKIY and Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV,
The statement cf NOSENKO that although he had heard of
GOLITSYN he had never personally met GOLITSYN, stands in conflict
with the statements of GOLITSYN that he, GOLITSYN, had met and
talked with NOSENKO in the SCD in the late 1950's. Tne description
of GOLITSYN of tnis meeting is that of a casual encounter in the halls
rather than a specific office visit. In light of this, the absence of any
xeason why NOSENKO from his point of view should remember such

an encounter and the absence of any reason for NOSENKO to lie on this

issue, it is eminently reasonable to conclude that the encounter took
place but that NOSENKO simply has no recollection of it. There is
no reason to attach sign:icance to this lapse of memory.

The previous opinion that NOSENKO did not hoid the claimed
yasition of Deputy Chief, First Section, First Department, during 1960 «, ,
1961 has had the most mer t in the controversy over his statements __
relative to-his KGB career. This particular aspect will be covered in.
detail in another section, but of note at this time is the controversy
over what duties the position of Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD, KGB,
entails or does not entail, It ie a fruitless exercise to attempt to judge ,
whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the First Section in 1960 - 1961 |
on the pacis of whether his knowledge of the total activities of the First
Section was commensurate with the knowledge of a Deputy Branch Chief
in GIA in regard to the activities of the entire Branch,

Whether NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD,

KGB, must be judged on the basis of what were the duties of a Deputy
Chief of Section in the SCD and in particular what were his duties in
the particular assignment. The organizational structure of the KGB
may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure

of CIA, but any similarities are surely not such as to permit a judgment

i 0001047



a]

as to whether NOSENKO held a certain claimed position on the basis
of a comparison of his activities and responsibilities with that inherent
in a.somewhat similar position in CIA,

One of the most important differences between United States

agencies or organizations, inciuding CIA, and'the bureaucratic structure

of,agencies or organizations in the USSR, including the KGB, is the

“salary structure. Pay of a KGB officer is based on military rank and

on actual position held with an additional percentage increase for longevity

and language qualification, Actual position held is important from a

monetary: viewpoint in addition to the prestige. As an example, the

“difference in montaly salary between a captain and a major is twenty

rubles and the difference in salary between a Senior Case Officer and
a Deputy Chief of Section is also twenty rubles. An increase in military
rank alone has limited pay advantages, as for example a Lieutenant

’
Colonel who is only a Senior Case Officer receives le:

pay than a major
who holds the position of Chief of Section,
During current interviews, an effort has been made to obtain

from NOSENKO statements concerning his responsibilities in the various

_ Claimed positions, The judgment on whether he held or did not hold

: the various claimed Positions, in view of the absence of any factual

ceormetne en. 00LE48 |



supporting or refuting information, has necessarily been based to a
considerabie degree on the logic of the statements made by NOSENKO.
Admittedly this is not the most satisfactory way of resoiving the

questions, but it is the only method possibie at this time.

ONTLCOTING CIA IN 1962 '

AND FOR HIS DEF:

TION IN 1964?



es

C._Has NOSENKO given an acceptable explanation of his
motivation in. contacting CLA in 1962 and for his defection in 1964? Of

the eight listed categories which are being given specific consideration
in the matter of the bona fides of NOSENKO, this category is probably
the most difficult in which to present a logical position with factual
ee There are too many intangible aspects involved and although
motivation is an important factor, full resolution of the motivation
problem is not a paramount factor in deciding whether NOSENKO is or

is not a‘dispatched agent. NOSENKO could have contacted this Agency in

“1962 and-defected in 1964 without KGB knowledge and yet even at this late

date have failed to disclose some important events of a personal nature

which actually were important ingredients in his ultimate decision.

Defectors are humans and have at least the normal reluctance to admit
?

unfavorable information which.they consider of a personal nature.

On 31 October 1967 NOSENKO, following.a request, furnished a

handwritten memorandum on the topic of his motivation, a typed copy of

which is attached. The memorandum, although not grammatically correct,

‘Sis quite understandable and is worthy of review. The tenor of the memo-

randum is ‘one of increasing disillusionment with the Soviet regime.

Stu:

NOSENKO and others of his generation have lived in a Soviet society
throughout their entire lives, The environment is an important factor
of influence in the life of an individual and true disillusionment is at
best usually a gradual process in which maay factors, some recognized
and some not recognized by the individual, have played a role in varying

degrees.

NOSENKO, until 1955 and possibiy until ‘the death of his father

“iri August 1956, could be compared to the-profligate son of wealthy

parents in the United States who finally graduates from college and obtains

employment perhaps in the firm of his father without actually earning any of

_ the; luxuriés he has enjoyed, ‘The father of NOSENKO was not only wealthy

by Soviet standards but also held a high government position. The
influence of his father and the name. of ais father undoubtedly was an
important if not the mest-important factor in NOSENKO éven being
permitted to enter the Naval RU and the KGB even though NOSENKO is
particularly reluctant to admit, perhaps even to himself,. that this was
the primary reason,

The above should not be construed as any reflection on the

“agtual intelligence of NOSENKO, but rather as an explanation of how

A question has been previously raised regarding his motivation

in contacting CIA in 1962, particularly his statement that he needed money
and would sell "two pieces of information." NOSENKO has stated that he

wanted to make a contact with the Americans, that‘he was not emotionally '

American Intelligence, ;

The above statements by NOSENKO are.not in conflict with the

"two pieces of information, '' almost
immediately gave more information, made no significant demands for
money, and in fact his price for "two pieces of information" was
ridiculously low by American standards. NOSENKO has during current
interviews stated, as he first.stated in 1962, that he had spent excessive
amounts of money in one or two riotous evenings. However, NOSENKO

has during current interviews stated that he could have covered his

expenditures by other means without receivin;

money from the

Americans.



SECRET 4

NOSENKO hae otated that the night before bie departure from

Geneva to the USSR be gave serious thought to defection but was not
emotionally adapted to defect at that time. Following his raturn to the
Soviet Union, NOSENKO, during a period of time, made his final
decision to defect at the first opportunity, renlining that it meant
leaving his wife, children, end other members of hie fac-ily in the
ssn.

Some aspects of the motivation of NOSENKO are obscure and

will probably so remain. It would be preferable Lf an oxact detailed

chronology of all the factors involved could be prepared or if even od atsisiit)
certain obvious factors could be accurately delineated. These are both :

impossible at this time and probably at.any'time in the future, What

is. important at this time ts a decision e¢ to whether the motivation of
NOSENKO was beood on personal reasons with no implications of KGB
dispatch. It lo considered that the explanation of NOSENK® concerning
bis motivation ia acceptable and that hie statement that no one except
the Americans was aware of his contacts with the Americana in 1962 : ‘
ox bis fatent to defect in 1964 te supported by other information of a ie

collateral nature. (See Section It, H.)

D,._Is the information furnished by NOSENXO to CIA concerning
KGB operations, personalities, and organization reasonably commen-

surate with his claimed KGB career? The conclusion is that the infor-
mation furnished by NOSENKO concerning KGB operations, personalities,
and organization is more than reasonably commensurate with his claimed
career in the KGB from mid-March 1953 to his: defection in early February
1964.
“in reaching the above conclusion, ‘consideration has been given
to his. cidimied. departmental assignments and claimed-positions in each
department, Certain allowance has been made ‘for faulty memory with
consideration being given to whether there is any indication of deception
or whether the failure to recall a particular item of interest can logically
?

be attributed to the vagaries of the human mind, There is, of course, no
accurate stindard of measurement which would permit a positive deter-
mination as to whether inability to recall certain details or events is

- actually due to the fact that the human mind cannot recall all past evente

or could be attributed to willful deception,

SECRET

GOULCED



~

PueVetieas

An effort has been made to determine if there are any particular

patterns or areas where NOSENKO has indicated he did not recall
specific matters or certain details, and a pattern or specific areas
have been noted. NOSENXO, in fact, ‘has an unusually good memory
as evidenced by the extensive information iurnished by NOSENKO purely
from recollection, In addition, there has been no material reluctance
on the part of NOSENKO to discuss his entire life, KGB officers he has
known, KGB organization and procedures, or other topics of interest.
NOSENKO has furnished considerable detail concerning KGB
officers whom he has known at various periods in his entire KGB career.

He. has been very consistent in information furnished and has frequently

added certain details which he recalled at-a later date.
Certain remarks will be made in another section in regard to

the volume and scope of information furnished by NOSENKO, This in-

formation is not selective, but is’an excellent indicator that NOSENKO

was assigned to the First Department-and Seventh Department, SCD,

during the claimed periods of time and held the claimed positions. Con-

sideration has been given to his various claimed KGB assignments in

evaluating the information furnished in an effort to assess whether his

indicated knowledge was commensurate with his claimed position during

oOULCEL


a particular period of time or suggested the possibility that he did not
occupy che position which he claimed to have held.

It ie considered that information furnished by NOSENKO supports
hie claimed positions in the SCD. it has not been possible to substantially
confirm through collateral sources that NOSENKO served in hia claimed

positions. Neither has it been possible to obtain from other sources an

applicable description of the duties or responsibilities of an individual
holding any of the positions NOSENKO claimed to have held after 1958, It
is felt thezo can be no question that NOSENKO served in the capacities of

junior case officer, case officer, and senior case officer during 1953 - 1957.

As regards the duties and responsibilities of a Deputy Chit of Section,

Chief of ‘Section, and Deputy Chief of Department, and whether NOSENKO
held these various claimed positions, a considerable amount of personal
judgment has been necessary. This personal judgment has been made in
as judicial a manner as possible, with full knowledge that any opinion in
regard tothe above is largely dependent upon information from NOSENKO.
+ .NOSENKO has compiled detailed diagrams of the actual offices
he claims to have occupied and aie offices during the four pri-

may periods of time: 1953 ~ 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -

1963." He has prepared specific memoranda concerning his co-officers

0001062



and other personnel, and changes of personnel, as well as diagrams

of the offices of the Chief and Deputy Ghiefs of the SCD during 1956 -
1964, ‘This material is internally consistent, Furthermore NOSENKO
could not: possibly have known that this detailed information could not
immediately be checked for accuracy, at least in part, with a source

or another officer who has defected since mid-1964, If these diagrams
arid memoranda were not relatively correct, NOSENKO, who is quite
astute in matters of counterintelligence, would hardly have voluntarily
prepared the material in such detail.’ ‘This type of information is
peculiarly adaptable for analysie by a knowledgeable source or by another
defector ‘and could, if not relatively correct, permit a rather positive con-
clusion that NOSENKO was lying or fabricating information.

NOSENKO has furnished quite specific information on KGB
operations during the 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -
1963 periods of time. As might be expected, his specific knowledge is
Jess éor the 1953 - 1955 period; but his own personal situation and attitude
until 1955 - 1956, which are mentioned elsewhere, should be given
consideration. In any event, he has furnished adequate information so
that hie claimed assignment during 1953 - 1955 is considered sufficiently |
substantiated even though his actual job performance undoubtedly
deserved a low rating. ‘ : —_ ae

i oe ee G001C63
SECRET



The knowledge of NOSENKO-concerning cases, KGB operations,
and other officers can consistently be related to his claimed department :

and position assignment during the 1953 to January 1964 period. The

scope of his knowledge of his own department when considered in toto

ie broader after 1957 than before, which is compatible with his claim of
4ncreased responsibilities. His knowledge of thé work of other departments
of. the SCD from the late 1950's on is also more-extensive, which is also a i

further indication that NOSENKO actually held the claimed positions

during this pericd of time.

from NOSENKO was nover disseminated or investigated,

SMITH was a leading suspect. After the ourfactag of SMITH by the Gs
Sovists, it became apparect that SMITH, rather than HAMILTON, was
tdentical to “ZHARI," Investigation disclosed that no definite informa-
tlen could be established {n regard to the actual whereaboute of SMITH
after circa mid-1960. It cannot be positively stated that aobeeerais
investigetion in 1964 of the "ZHARI" lead would have led to the identi-
flestion of Joha Discos SMITH as "ZHARI," However, auch (dentifi-
cation would have been of considoradie interest to the Department of
Stete and CIA, aad could wery well kave permitted certaim ection which 1
would have at leact lessened the propaganda effect.of the surprise

NOSENKO, in June 1962, furnished information from which
Willlam VASSALL could be quickly identified. GOLITSYN, ta late

tration of the British Government on the basle of which the British

Sorvices had complied a lst of twenty suspects, including VASSALL.

Even though it may be presumed that investigation of the twenty suspects

would ultimately have resulted in a determination that VASSALL wag

the agent on whom GOLITSYN had furnished certain information, the

information from NOSENKO tn June 1962 resulted in the earlier termi-

nation by the British Services of a still valuable productive KGB agent.
Although not the case of a KGB agent, the matter of tha micro-

phones in the United States Emba!

y should also be mentioned,
GOLITSYN, following his defection in Decernber 1961, furnished
certain information in regard to microphones in the United States
Embassy (Chancery). Since in fact the microphones we.¢ connected
to coatral cables, location of one microphone would logically have led
to the exporure of the entire set of inicrophones. However, appro-
priate action was not taken on this information and the KGB would have
bean aware thet no action wes taken prior to June 1962 when NCSENKO
fizet contacted CLA.

If NOSENKO te a2 dispatched KGB agent, It ts not clear why the
KGB would attract spscific attention to a evaters of microphones which
must have ottll had some value ae of June 1962. A presumption may
be made that if NOSENKO was a dispatched agent, the KGB had, as of
1962, an advanced system of monitoring devices which rendered the
above microphone system obsolete, However, no concrete evidence

of such an advauced system is available and it should be noted that it

F. Is there evidence of KGB deception or ''give away" in

inforraation furnished by NOSENKO which would warrant a conclusion

that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB? The conclusion in this

summary is that NOSENKO was not dispatched by the KGB. in
reaching this conclusion, a full examination of the above ¢.- siion has
been both a necessary and integral part, iste

It is inherent that the volume of information furnished by
NOSENKO is only one of the factors which should be given consideration
in arriving at a conclusion that NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by
the KGB. If NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, the KGB would have
surely been willing to sacrifice certain information of value to the KGB
in order to support the bona fides of NOSENKO, However, if NOSENKO
was dispatched, it must have been to accomplish or further a KGB
purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be
unknown,

An examination of the circumstances under which NOSENKC first
contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his behavior during thése contacts is
particularly pertinent since during this period of time NOSENKO would
have surely been under direct KGB control if there are any implications

of KGB dispatch in the NOSENKO case.

SECRET



NOSENKO has stated that his original approach to "sell two
pieces of information" was his own idea as to what was most lixely to

be successful. Ni

with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the
time, and felt that if he merely stated that he was a "KGB counter-
intelligence officer who wanted to give information, " he very possibly
would be rejected, It should be noted that NOSENKO even during his
first contact did not limit his remark to the "two pieces of information"
and began to talk quite freely on other matters.

If NOSENKO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 1962
contacts, would have been very carefully briefed and that his remarks
or statements would have not been of a nature which could cause any
suspicion in regard to the bona fides of NOSENKO. Instead, a current
review of his statements and remarks during his five contacte in 1962
indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and actual lies were quitet
likely typical of a braggadocio element in the personality of NOSENKO
and may also have been evidence supporting the statement by NOSENKO
that he usually had a few drinks of liquor before each contact in

Geneva.

0001080
SECRET.



NOSENKO, during his five contacts in Geneva, made many
statements which in retrospect were impossivie, and the investigation
of which could only have raised certain questions con: 2rning NOSENKO.
‘The following is a list of the more obvious areas in which NOSENKO
made gross exaggerations or made incorrect or impossible statements.

{a) NOSENKO claimed he personally was with

Oleg M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the SCD, during the

recruitment pitch to[James sidasazad, (This was

a lie and an interview wisn BrongSzng}wita display -

(4) NOSENKO claimed personal contact wita] Edmund o6
STEVENS}who, according to NOSENKO, kad been recruited

by the KGB. (NOSZ.

KO actually had never personaiiy met
(STEVENS and only had seen[STEV SJonce at 2 distance.)

{e) NOSENKO dated the recruitment of "ANDREY"
in Moscow as 1949-1950. At the samo time he furnished
information that "ANDREY" (who is considered identical to
Dayle Wallis SMITH) ae in Moscow during a part of the time
that Roy RHODES, also a recruited agent, was assigned to
Moscow, 1951-1953. "“ANDREY" (SMITH) was actually in
Moscow 1952-1954,

{f) NOSENKO said he, GRIBANOV, and another officer
met Edward Ellis SMITH. (NOSENKO has since stated he did
not meet SMITH aad that his only role was obtaining a foreign
typewriter and paper for a KGB agent involved in the SMiT)
operation. }

(g) NOSENKO in a number of instances spoke in the
first person, saying “We did this," or "We did that," in

xeference to a particular KGB activity in which he now admits

‘ G061082

SIR


he was not involved but had some knowledge. (If

NOSENKO was under XGB control in 1962, both he

and the AGB should have known that these indicated

exaggerations would eventually lead to a question

concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO. )

In 1562-1963 a number of similarities were noted between
information furnished by NOSENKO and information which had been
furnished by GOLITSYN prior to June 1962, These similarities were
quite striking and gave riseto certain suspicions of NOSENKO because
he provided information which the KGB would presumably have considered
already compromised as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN. Certain
of the similarities at the time could only be explained in terms of
NOSENKO being a dispatched agent. The following are some examples of
the similarities noted,

(a) Both furnished information in regard to
[Donan PREIsFREUND} 06
(b) Both furnished information in regard toa
[Rnilitazy code clerk case (James STORSBERGH, 08, ok
(ce) Both furnished information in regard to a
trip of Vladislav KOVSHUK, under an assumed name,
to the United States. (GOLITSYN was sure it was

connected with a reactivation of an agent formerly in

5 GO0§BS
“SECRET

dbsbungtassauaiansnsiatssssseseeter=="


eae

Moscow, or a recruitment of an American formerly
with the United States Embassy in Moscow; and NOSENKO
related it directly to the "ANDREY" case, giving the
assumed name which KOVSHUK used. )

(a) Both furnisaed information in regard to
microphones in the United States Embassy in Moscow.

(e) Both furnished information in regard to
Bamind STEVENS]andffsaac Hens) HAPIRO}

The above list is not complete nor does it indicate the actual
differences in the amount of information furnished on any particalar
topic by GOLITSYN and NOSENKO. To cite the above in detail in tie
summary is believed unnecessary since the only point of real interest
is whether the fact that NOSENKO was aware of certain events, cases,
or situations of which GOLITSYN was also aware raises a legitimate
question concerniig the bona fides of NOSENKO.

The above area of concern has been thoroughly examined and
it is considered that the fact that NOSENKO iurnished some information
on certain cases or situations previously mentioned in lesser or

greater detail by GOLITSYN cannot logically be construed as evidence

that NOSENKO wae dispatched by the KGB. NOSENKO has during

current interviews satisfactorily sourced his information in alm: st
every instance. In a few instances he has said he did not recall
how he learned of a particular piece of information but these
apparent lapses of memory were not large in number and are
considered to be in no way suspicious, i

The general area in which there was a similarity between
information furnished by GOLITSYN in late 1961 - early.1962 and
information furnished by NOSENKO in June 1962 and which would have
been the most significant insofar as the security of the United States
Government was or is concerned related to certain activities centering
around or in the First Department, SCD.

It is the conclusion of this summary that NOSENKO was an
officer of the First Section, First Department, SCD, during 1953-1955
and was Deputy Chief of the same section in 1960 - 1961, Therefore,
the fact that NOSENKO furnished information concerning certain cases
or situations in the First Department and the fact that GOLITSYN
farnished information concerning the same case or situation is not

unusual or necessarily suspicious. NOSENKO has stated that GOLITSYN

that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief of the First Section in 1960 has
been noted and commented on in another section of this summary.

GOLITSYN has furnished certain information which he re-
ceived from officers of the First Section, First Department, SCD. '
In each instance where this information, which was fragmentary, could
not be immediately correlated with information from NOSENKO, it was
previously considered to be evidential of deception or lying on the part
of NOSENKO, This position, however, failed to allow for the possibility
that the discrepancies between the two sources were, at least in certain
instances, more apparent than real.

In certain instances it has now been possible to correlate irag-
mentary information from GOLITSYN with information from NOSENKO,
making it evident that in these instances the differences could not be
construed as in any way refiecting against NOSENKO. The four examples
cited below represent two probable correlations, (a) and (b); one possible
correlation, (c); and one instance where no correlation is possible at this

time, (4):

{a) GOLITSYN furnished information which he
received in April-May 1960 from Gennadiy GRYAZNOV
that an attempt had been made by the KGB to recruit an

in Moscow through a male Soviet friend, but that tae
attempt had failed, GOLITSYN also furnished information
that the woman had left Moscow by the time he learned of
the information but that the Soviets hoped she would return
to Moscow so that further work could be undertaken to
efiect her recruitment, He did not recall the name of the
secretary, but did recall that it was{a long and "German (%

NOSENKO has furnished information in regard to a

rather than during the spring of 1960 when GOLITSYN was
‘preparing ior his assignment to Helsinki, Finland, This

GRYAZNOV in April or May 1960 that an American
employee of the Embassy in Moscow was either recruited
or prepared for recruitment on the basis of a homosexual
compromise beginning in 1959 and concluding in 1960,

The previous summary also states that according to
GOLITSYN, the KGB had photographed the American in
various homosexual acts, but SHELEPIN, who had just
become Chairman of the KGB, was at the time stressing
iceoiogicai rather than blackmail recruitments. SHELEPIN
«id not exclude future use of the photographs which the KGB
would hold in reserve.

One of the above homosexual agente succeeded in
involving Baa Er7] in homosexual activities which were
photographed by the KGB but, according to NOSENKO,
although the photographs were of a good quality, the KGB

was unable to use the photographs in 1959 because of a

general ban by the Central Committee on the recruitment

of the United States Exhibition guides due to the pienned
visit of President SISENHOWER to the Sovict Union,
NOSENKO also stated that the compromising material

The trip of Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki, Finland in

also mentioned in another section pertaining to the 1960-1961 career
of NOSENKO. GOLITSYN stated that KOSOLAPOV came to Helsinki
to accompany an American Embassy code clerx on the train to
Moscow and that KOSOLAPOV planned to strike up an acquaintance
with the code clerk which could be continued\in Moscow,

The American Embassy code clerk referred to above was
undoubtedly[John cat Andon the train manifest lists(John GARLAND]
and Viktor KOLOSOV (Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV) as passengers on the

of KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki, although being well aware of a previous trip.

NOSENKO, as Deputy Chief of the First Section. specifically
charged with work against code clerke, should have been aware of the
November 1960 trip of KOSOLAPOV to and from Helsinki. His lack of

* ynowledge may or may not be explainable in terme of his other activities
such as hie trip to Guba in November-December 1960 but it cannot be

interpreted as evidence NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB since, if

(OSOLAPOV to Helsinki in November 1960, as this was an event the

A theory which has previously been given consideration and

warranted full consideration was that if NOSENKO was dispatched, :

hie mission was to confuée leads furnished to American intelligence
and/or to denigrate the value of information furnished by GOLITSYN.
In connection with this theory, it should be noted that NOSENKO during
current interviews has not made any remarks which could in any way
be construed as derogatory to GOLITSYN. In addition, NOSENKO does ‘
not claim to Have any detailed knowledge of the FCD and frequently,
when some topic peculiar to the FCD bas been broached with NOSENKO,

his immediate reply has been to the effect that "I didn't work in the FCD,"

or "You should ask GOLITSYN about that."
In-connection with any consideration of whether the contact of
NOSENKO with CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have been initiated by
the KGB as 2 result of the defection of GOLITSYN, the timing of certain
events should be noted.. GOLITSYN defected on i5 December 1961.
- NOSENKO departed from Moscow in March 1962 for Geneva, ‘Switzerland,
where he remained until 15 June 1962. ;
It is felt that it would have been practically impossible if not
impossible fot KGB officials to complete an assessment of the.actual or

potential. damage which could result from the defection of GOLITSYN,



er ee

seuss: 4

select NOSENKO as the individual who would be dispatched to counter -
act the possible damage, and appropriately brief NOSENKO prior to
his departure for Geneva in March 1962. Therefore, if NOSENKO é
was dispatched by the KGB, it would appear that pians for this would

have predated the defection of GOLITSYN and that any GOLITSYN

aspect could only be a related aspect and not the basis for the original
plan to dispatch NOSENKO. In addition, if NOSENKO was dispatched, : i
it would hardly seem necessary for the KGB to send NOSENKO to
Geneva two and one-half months before hie first contact with CIA, . ~§
The theory has also been considered that NOSENKO could have
been dispatched to confuse and divert American intelligence and thus
to protect an important KGB penetration or penetrations of the United
States Government, particularly CIA. This is a theory which should

and has been given full consideration, out it is not possible to factualiy

substantiate or reful theory in the absence of specific information

that high-level KGB penetrations do or do not exist,
Actually, as regards NOSENKO, the primary area which should
be given consideration in the above matter is if all the information from

NOSENKO is accepted, what effect would or could it have on the efforts _

of American counter-intcijigence té determine the identity of and
take appropriate action against KGB penetrations of the United
States Government. The only answer to this question seems to be : 4
that there would be little consolation or assurance to American intelli-
gence even if every statement by NOSENKO was accepted at face value,
The only specific area in which NOSENKO could be even con-
sidered to claim full knowledge is the Tata cures Embassy in Moscow.
In thie area hie statements could be construed as assurance that there
were no recruitments of American personnel in the United States Embassy

expresaed.opinion of NOSENKO is considered elsewhere in this summary
and analysts may differ as to whether a recruitment could have occurred
of which NOSENKO did not have knowledge, assuming that his statements

are made in good faith, It should be noted, however, that at this time

there is no specific information which is in direct conflict with the
expressed opinion of NOSENHD, : : ; i
NOSEWNKO, as previously mentioned, has never claimed any

particular knowledge of FCD activities, In addition, he does not claim

to be aware of all recruitments of Americans by theSCD. Asan .

example, -he has made it clear that his knowledge of SCD activities
against members oi delegations, foreign businessmen, foreign students,
and individuals in the USSR on the invitation of a Soviet organization or
a component of the Soviet Government is extremely limited and at best
mainly of a collateral nature.

NOSENKO does not even claim any detailed knowledge of
activities of the Second Section (Active Line) of the First Department, SCD,
nor does he claim to know all of the cases of which the Chief of the Seventh
Department was aware, The latter is specifically supported by certain
notes brought out by NOSENKO which are short references to a number
of Seventh Department cases which are identified only by the KGB code
name. These notes, according to NOSENKO, were made when he had an
opportunity te review a notebook held by the Chief of the Seventh Department

and constitute the only knowledge NOSENKO had of these particular cases.

H._Is there any evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO in 1962

or in 1964 with CIA were known to the XGB prior to his defection or

that NOSENKO was ever briefed by the KGB relative to bis behavior

or KGB objectives during these contacts or aiter his defection? The

conclusion is that there is no evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO
in 1962 or in 1964 with GIA were imown to the KGB prior to his
defection and that NOSENKO was never briefed in any manner by the KGB.
The basis for the above conclusion is substantially contained in i
“previous sections, It is being treated here as a separate area of interest
since it is a sufficiently important area as to warrant individual consideration,
It is recognized that since positive factual confirmation such as
the KGB file on NOSENKO is not available, any conclusion concerning
whether NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by the KGB can only ve
\ based on the full review of available information from NOSENKO,
collateral sources, independent investigation and the opinion of the ”
individual analyst concerning the significance or non-significance of
each item of available information.
=. ‘The conclusion that the contacts of NOSENKO with CIA in 1962

a) and 1964 prior to bis defection were not known to the KGB is

go0ii6?



necessarily based in part on a judgment as to whether any of his
activities or information logically warrant a substantial suspicion
that they wee or could be in any part the result of KGB direction
or control, One of the particular areas considered wae his apparent
behavior during his contacts with CIA in June 1962 and the conclusion 1
was that it waa incomprehensible that he could have been under KGB
control at that time,
Consideration has been given to the possibility that his 1962

contacts with CIA were not known to the KGB,” but became known to

i the KGB. later and NOSENKO was doubled by the KGB, It was con-

cluded ‘that there was no basis'for or information which would warrant
: serious consideration of the above possibility aside from the separate
conclusion that the KGB would be very unlikely to reward a traitor in
KGB eyes by sending him again to Geneva where he would be quite free
to defect, :

Worthy of comment in this section is the fact that NOSENKO,
‘during hie 1962 contacts, expressed considerable concern over his
\personal security, requesting that knowledge concerning his identity be

‘The following is a quote of the previous conclusions in the case of Yuriy
Ivanovich NOSENKO. (The specific conclusions have been given the designation

of A - G for purposes of easier correlation with other sections of this summary.)

UMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES"

"NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in
successively. senior positions of auhorily from which he derived
extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and results of KGB
operations against Americans in the Soviet Union in the period
1953-1963. To substantiate his claim, he provides an impressive
array of information about KGB personnel, organization and opera-
tions which, to the extent that it has been confizmed, is presumptive
evidence of hie bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including
intelligence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's
claims. According to some of these sources, NOSENKO was a

senior KGB officer who occupied a series of sensiive. positions, who

oS a et ee ee 001444

enjoyed considerable authority and trust despite personal short-
comings, and whose defection, 'the greatest loss ever suffered

: Légal Residency, and justified the formulation of plang to assas~

by Soviet Intelligenee',. paralyzed the work of

sinate him."
“The examination has compared cach element of NOSENKO's
biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known
facts and reasonable surmise. The examination reflects the
test to which his accounts were put: whether his accounts are
internally coherent and consisténi with known fact, and whether
hie actually gained the information ie has from occupying the
_ KGB positions-he claims to have.held, In short, is he what he
says he is, according to his own-accounts?"
“This examination hed led to the following findings, arrived
at independently:
A. NOSENKO cié not serve in the Naval RU
in any of the capacities or at the places and times he
claimed, :
B. NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the
J vmanner or at the time he. claimed.

D. During the period 1955-1960, ne was neither
a senior case ojjicer in, nor Deputy Chief of, the Seventh i

E. ‘NOSENKO was neither Deputy Chief of the
American Embassy Section nor a senior oificer or
- supervisor in the Section during the period 1961-1962. (sic)
F, NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962"he was Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section and wae"
thereafter a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are

not-credible,

*. G.“NOSENKO has no valid claim to certainty)
that the KGB recruited no American Embassy personnel
between 1953 and nis defection in 1964.

These findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of probability

or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance of avai
in each instancé.""

“The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive evidence
of NOSENKO's bona fides. The contradictions in NOSENKO's accounts
of his. life and KGB service are so extensive as to make his claims

as a whole unacceptabie. While truth and fact.in this case frequently : 4

~ 001416 -



Uaevetne

cannot be established with certainty, it is evicent that truth and
fact are not what NOSENAO relates. By almost any test, virtuaily
any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned dy iact or probability,

or contradicted or retracted in his own statements. NCSENKO is

not what he claims to be, and thus he is not a bona fide defector."
"Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is nota bona fide
defector, it is necessary to attempt to determine his true motives
for contacting American intelligence and for providing the information
_ he has given. Here, it must be recognized that the evidence, largely

consisting of NOSENKO's own assertions, does not permit unequivocal
conclusions. Neverteiess, the question cannot be ignored, The
character of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact that
some of his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet officials,
and the necessity to make decisions about NOSENKO's future all
require that at least a provisional judgment be mace."

: "Of the reasonable explanations advanced for NOSENKO's
misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a swindler posing
as a former KGB officer for reasons of personal advantage; that he

suffers from a deranged personality or unbalanced mind; that he has

greatly exaggerated his actual rank, status and access in the KGB, for

simply personal reasons; or,. finally, that he is a dispatched KGB

“The first two possibilities are easily dismissed. That

. NOSENKO is not simply a swindler who falsely claims for personal

advantage to have been a KGB ofiicer is evident, we believe, from
the confirmed details of KGB organization, fer soacal and operations
which he has provided and which could only derive from within the
KGB itself,"

“Second, as noted in the ext, extensive psychiatric and

psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out the’

possibility that NOSENKO's actions and testimony are the product
of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind."

mt ig somewhat more plausible that NOSENKO is a KGB
officer who served in at least some of the components for ae

or all of the time periods that he claims, but who greatly exag-

. gerated his positions, rank and access to intormation, and

invented some matters outright, to achieve greater status with
American Intelligence. This explanation, however, fails to

"Because none of the above explanations is consistent with
the data developed in interrogations and investigations, we are
left with the hypothesis that NOSENKO was dispatched by the

none of them renders it untenable. *

NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence (Naval RU) during March 1951 to early

However, ‘previous e‘forts of NOSENKO to revert to his original 1962
statement that he graduated in 1950 were not accepted and an unwarranted
significance was given to the 1949 = early 1953 period of time.

It is considered that NOSENKO has adequately explained his

matters and that his claimed service in Navy Intelligence from March

acceptabie, It is not considered necessary to comment concerning all .
of the ‘remarks in the previous summary regarding the claimed Naval
RU service of NOSENKO as reflected on pages 49-59 and remarks will,
for purposes of brevity, be limited in scope.
The statement is made in the previous summary that "The sole i
Headquarters RU officer NOSENKO identified was the Personnel Chief, i
Colonel KALOSHIN, He identified no ranking officers in either the Baltic
or -Far East Intelligence Staffs, Some 30 GRU officers he did identify,
by his own admission, NOSENKO knew not from his Naval RU service,
but. through social acquaintance, later, in Moscow, or through hia visits : 7

of GRU personnel of whom ke had some knowledge. The attached was

It is interesting to note that the attached list contains the names
of approximately 20 GRU officers whom NOSENKO relates to the early
1950's period. In addition, NOSENKO has, during current interviews
and in other memoranéa, furnished the names of additional Navy Intelii-

whether NOSENKO ever served in the Baltic area with Naval Intelligence
and even question his geographical knowledge of the area, Attached is a
copy of a handwritten memorandum with certain diagrams prepared by
NOSENKO on 21 February.1968 concerning his assignment with Navy

. sIntelligencein the Far East and the Baltic area, ‘The memorandum was
. completed by. NOSENKO without any reference material and a review of
his diagrams indicates they are quite accurate,

NOSENKO had previously stated that his service in the Baltic
area was at Sovetsk Primorskiy and during current interviews recalled
that the-former name of the place, an almost deserted fisnermen's
village, was Fishausen, The previous designation given by NOSENKO
for this place as having the mail address of Sovetsk Primorskiy had
caused the conclusion that his alleged.place of assignment was non-
existent, A further checkin the-matter would have disclosed that the
5 place was not nonexistent, that it is currently known as Primorsk and

. that ‘the former German name of the fishing village wae Fischhausen.

The previous summary aiso stated that despite nie claimed
active coramissioned service in the Navy, NOSENiO knew nothing of
it _
Soviet Navy tradition, doctrines, or organization of procedures, It
should be noted that there is a considerable difference between being
a member of the Naval RU and being.an actual member of the Soviet
Navy. The situation could be compared to a career civilian employee

of the Office of Nava] Intelligence and a line officer in the United States

Navy.

B. NOSENKO dic not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time

claimed. (Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "B" in the previous summary in regard _
ty NOSENKO, The conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO entered
the then Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his
entry was not only facilitated by but due to the influence of General
Bogdan Zakharovich KC3ULOV.

Previous statements by NOSENKO and changes relative to date of
entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section of the summary
and will not be repeated here, His statements during current interviews
that he entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a case officer in the First
Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, are con=
sidered adequately Talents and should be Sees pical

The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) that

NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed

“was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSENKO as to when

he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in -

1965 NOSENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.

SECRET 6004132

Saute

in 1964, NOSENKO had given two dates in 1952 as his time of entry into
the XGB in an effort not to admit that he had failed to graduate from the
Institute of International Relations in 1949.

‘The previous summary gave considerable weight to the statements
of NOSENKO indicating that he, did not enter the KGB (MVD) under what
are considered normal KGB procedures, Proper allowances were not
given for position of the father of NOSENKO, the Minister of Shipbuilding,
and the influence of General KOBULOV: An analyst can either accept or
reject the statement of NOSENKO that he entered the KGB (MVD) through

the influence of.General XOBULOV;. but,. if the statement is accepted, then

the failure. of NOSENKO to be required: to follow normal, KGB, procedures

-should.also.be.accepted.. A Communist society or a Soviet intelligence
organization is not and could not be immune to influence by a bigh official.

General KOBULOV as of mid-March 1953 was. F:

the Minister of the then os

The previous summary raises several points concerning the

eligibility of NOSENKO for the KGB (MVD). It points out on page 67

that other than his undistinguished period of service with the Naval RU,

‘he was no more eligible for a KGB.appointment in 1953 than he was at

the time of his previous rejection in 1950, This statement is not contro-

vertibl and-is fully accepted with the qualification that in 1950 NOSENKO

0001138



was not sponsored by any person of influence as was the case in 1953
with General KOBULOV who in mid-March 1953 was the First Deputy
to BERIYA.

The previous summary also states that according to KGB
defectors farniliar with the standards in force at the time, no candidate
was accepted who had ever had tuberculosis. This is a flat statement

which it is doubtiul any defector or series of defectors could fully
pgeocbeb pence pcre . :

iate; namely, that it never happened. Until and unless it is

medically proven that NOSENKO did not have tuberculosis, it is accepted
that he did have tuberculosis in 1952 and was at a sanitarium ~~ vest.

place in Kubinka. It is also accepted that he was an officer inthe KGB

after mid-March 1953. The influence of KOBULOV could undoubtedly
have permitted NOSENKO to enter the KGB even though he previously
‘ had tuberculosis, but the flat statement that no candidate was accepted who
had ever had fe reaeuie is not and cannot be sufficiently substantiated.
The previous summary contained a number of additional remarks
“ and conclusions intended to show that NOSENKO was not eligible for and
therefore could not have entered the KGB (MVD). Comments concerning
" these-will be brief since there is considered to be no adequate basis at
this time on which to contend that NOSENXO did not enter the KGB

(MVD) as an officer: in. mid-March 1953. .A comment was made that

NOSENKO did not take a physical examination in connection'with his
processing ior KGB entry, and that such a medical examination was

a routine and mandatory part of the processing of a KGB candidate.

This statement makes no allowance for the influence of General

KOBULOV; but, in addition, does not ccnsider the fact that the Naval
RU dossier on NOSENKO was available to the KGB (MVD).

«+ The previous Hee also failed to note that the MVD would
have had independent information in regard to NOSENKO since the MVD
would have conducted any necessary inquiry in connection with the entry
of NOSENKO into.the Naval RU. As of 1953, the MVD undoubtedly also
had a dossier on the father of NOSENKO since this was still the STALIN

The summary also states’ that NOSENKO did not complete the

necessary lengthy Anketa before entry into the KGB (MVD) and did not

e. It would

seem that the influence of General KOBULOV could have permitted the
elimination of most if not all‘of the necessity of complying with normal
procedures, but NOSENKO has during interviews stated that he com-
pleted the Anketa while sitting at his desk after entry into the KGB (MVD).
Page 70 of the previous summary states that NOSENKO did not

know.the designation of his own Directorate either at the time he allegedly

001135



entered on duty or during his first year of KGB service. While L :
NOSENKO has claimed that the designation of his Directorate at the
time he entered the KGB (MVD) in mid-March 1953 was the Second

Chief Directorate and that it subsequently was redesignated the

First Chief Directorate, DERYABIN has stated this reversal of
designations occurred in March 1953.
STALIN died in early March 1953 and that same month the 5

MVD and the MGB were merged under the name MVD with BERLIYA
as Minister, BERIYA held this position until his arrest in early June ee : : i
1953. BERIYA was succeeded by KRUGLOV, who held office for less

.thana year, Yuriy.RASTVOROV, was recently queried concerning the te gi deel ps ay we
date of the reversal of the.designation of the FCD,and SCD and places
it as the end of April or early May 1953. GOLITSYN has indicated that
the change occurred "soon aftex the advent of BERIYA ao head of the
MVD in April 1953." In the light of our inability to fix the eifective date

of the reversal of the designations of the SCD and the FCD, itis i .

unreasonable to impugn NOSENKO on his statement as to the designation

of his Directorate at the time of his entry into the KGB (MVD).
There is a disagreement between NOSENKO and others as'towho  - :

ane responsible for the reversal:of designations of the FCD and the. SCD. :

. “NOSENKO is of the-opinion that it occurred under KRUGLOV, which is

we, GOULL36



in conflict with the statemenis of DERYABIN, RASTVOROV and cate

GOLITSYN, all of whom maintain that BERIYA was responsidle for
the changes. As for the issue of who was responsibie for the reversal
of designations, it would appear that NOSENKO is inerror. However,

the fact that he was a new junior officer and that this was a period of

upheaval in the KGB (MVD) effectively

eliminates any significance in

this issue.

NOSENKO is criticized in the previous summary for not knowing
the location of the Chief Directorate of the Militia or the history of the
iI (Committee of Information). NOSENKO has stated that he had no
contacts with either office during 1953-1955 and there is no adequate reason
to disbelieve this.statement. He is not aware of when the XI ceased to
exist (1951 given in the summary, but other information indicates the KI
continued to exist in a nominal capacity until the mid-1950's), but care
should be used in stating what NOSENKO should know if he held a certain
position, Readers of this summary may wish to reflect on their own
memory concerning the location and their knowledge of Agency facilities at
any given period of time or when Agency components or related organizations

were organized or ceased to exist.

The point has also been made that any career of NOSENKO
in the KGB sould have ended or he should have at least encountered ;
difficulty when his benefactor General KOBULOV, together with the : 4

brother of General KOBULOV, was arrested with the BERIYA group in

. i early June 1933. NOSENKO has during current interviews stated that he
encountered no difficulties but is aware that the KOBULOV connection
was discussed-by an officer from the Personnél Directory with an
official of the First Department, ‘Under other circumstances NOSENKO
would — possibly have encountered difficulty; but, it should be noted
ae the father of NOSENKO retained his position, that-NOSENKO only wet
met General KOBULOV through.his father, and that NOSENKO has. stated
that although his father knew General KOBULOV, his father could in no

way be considered a member of the BERIYA group.

C. NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section

throughout the 1953 - 1955 period as ne claimed, (Previous conclusion)

‘The above is conclusion "C" in the previous summary. The
conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO was an officer of the Firet
Section (American Embassy Section), First Department, from mid-March
1953 to late May 1955 when he was transferred to the’ Seventh Department,
ScD.

This period of time has been covered in detail with NOSENKO

during ‘current interviews, The conclusion is that NOSENKO was an

otiicer in the First Section but was not a very effective officer and that
both his work and behavior were decidedly influenced by the fact that he
was the son of the Minister of Shipbuilding, NOSENKO ie reluctant to
admit that he was other than slightly lackadaisical in his work during
this period of time, but is not hesitant to admit that his personal be-
havior was such as to cause him to be removed as Secretary to the

Komsomol unit in 1954 and to cause an unsatisfactory "characterization"

SECRET 6001140



to be prepared in early 1955 which necessitated a decision as to whether
he would be fired from the KGB or transierred to some other component.
The influence of his family is quite apparent in the above since
- his father was advised of his difficulties in 1954 by an official of the
KGB and his mother interceded on his behalf in 1955 with the Caief of
SCD. The result in 1955 was that NOSENXO was transferred to the
Seventh Department and not fired from tae KGB. :
‘The question has been raised as to how NOSENKO could remain

in the KGB when after 1954 he was not a member of the Komsomol and

| was not eligible to become a candidate for the Communist Party, This
is.a valid question but a plausible explanation is again the fact that he was
the con of the then Minister of Shipbuilding.

NOSENKO has stated curing previous and current interviews that
following his entry into the KGB and until circa mid-1954 he was respon-
sible for work against American correspondents in Moscow. He has not
claimed that he had any successes and kas stated that the work te news=
paper correspondents already recruited was being handled by othe® officers.
NOSENKO has explained that during this time he was a "new officer, "
indicating he could hardly have been expected to act as an experionced

officer.. His knowledge of correspondents in Moscow during this period

: information concerning his own agents is delieved of sufficient weight

; to accept the statement of NOSENKO that work against American cor-

respondents was his assignment from mid-March 1953 to mid-1954.
From circa mid-1954 until his transfer to the Seventh Depart~ ‘¢
ment in late May 1955, NOSENKO ciaims and has claimed he was an
officer of the First Section with the responsibility of work against the
Military‘Attaches (Army) at the United States Embassy in Moscow. It
is considered, based on his knowledge of the various Military Attache ae .

personnel and other collateral information furnished by NOSENXO, that

NOSENKO was an officer. of the First Section during the mid-1954 - late
May 1955. period of time, that his primary work was against members
of the Office of the Military Attache, but that the quality of his work
undoubtedly left much to be desired.

In circa mid-1954, NOSENKO was removed as Secretary of the
Komsomol unit and by early 1955 his performance was such that at least
certain officials in the First Department desired his removal from the

First Department, if not the KGB. Under these circumstances,

NOSENKO could be criticized as having been a very poor if net
undesirable KGB officer, but his knowledge of the First Section during

‘The above is conclusion "D" in the previous summary. The
current conclusion is that NOSENKO was an officer in the Seventh ’
Department, SCD, from late May 1955 to December 1959 and was
Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section, Seventh
Department from 1958 to December 1959.
During current interviews, NOSENKO has furnished extensive
information concerning his own activities in the Seventh Department
during the 1955-1959 period, Interviews of persons who were the subject
of KGB interest collaterally confirm that NOSENKO was personally in- ‘i
volved in certain claimed activities during 1955 to December 1959,
These activities include among others the recruitment of Richara Burci) O6

the claim of NOSENKO that during 1955 - December 1959 he was an
officer engaged in KGB operations against American-British Common-
wealth tourists in the USSR.

In addition, NOSENKO has furnished specific information about
an operation agains {Sea rsid ALA} an American tourist who was in
the Soviet Union from approximately September 1955 to December 1955.

time no particular 1955 case in which NOSENKO claims involvement
or personal knowledge has been substantiated by interview of the

individual involved.

mentioned specifics, adequately substantiate his ...imed service in the
Seventh Department and work against American-B ritish Commonwealth
tourists during the late May 1955 - December 1959 period,

NOSENKO has stressed that waen he transferred to the Seventh
Department, the Tourist Section had just been established and an agent
network was not .vailaole for operations against American and British
tourists, This seems quite logical since the infiux of tourists into the
USSR was jw t ina formative stage.

NOSENKO has spoken in detail about an agent network he de-
veloped after 1955 which primarily consisted of Intourist personnel
and two homosexual agents, "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" (KGB code
names), whose extensive use in KGB operations has been confirmed by
interviews with individuals who were the subject of homosexual com-
promise operations.

considered that even i: ¢ statements were accepted in toto, there

would stili not be an adequate basis Zor 4 conclusion that NOSENKO
was not an officer in the claimed positions i the Seventh Department
during the period of late May 1955 - December 1959. Nor is it con-
ceded that, if ali the sub-conclusions and the interpretations of various
areas of information were accepied without quaiification, there is any
evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, However, there
are certain assumptions and interpretations which appeared in the
previous summary which are particularly worthy of comment and which
are considered erroneous or require additional clarification.

On page 145 it is stated that the evidence suggests that NOSENKO
was an English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a counter-

cation of foreign agents

intelligence officer respensible for the ide
among tourists or for the development, recruitment, and exploitation

of agents for the KGB. Tne Second Chief Directorate, KGB, and the
MVD have used homosexual and heterosexual compromise in numerous
known (and'presumably unknown) successful recruitments and recruit-
ment attempts, This activity has not been limited to the Seventh Depart-
ment, SCD; and the innuendo that NOSENKO was "only an English-

The notes brought out by NOSENKO are considered in another
section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a full review

of all of the notes of NOSENKO currently available indicates that his -

statements as to how and why he obtained the information in the notes
are completely piausible. A detailed explanation of the notes furnished

detail with NOSENKO, He has given a detailed explanation of the material
which he brought out and his explanation of all aspects is very convincing.

‘The previous summary (page 144) suggested that the involvement
of NOSENKG in certain cases being handled by other Sections in the
Seventh Department or by the KGB Directorate of Moscow was unusual.
An exarnination of the cited cases does not indicate that his participation
was unusual, but rather that his explanation of why he was involved is
logical and normal, No consideration wae previously given to the English

were used in two of the four cited cases.

This question seems quite superf:

on a tourist visa and "real" tourists are the respon. cwility of the Seventh
Department. Deparunental responsibility within the SCD ior an indi-
vicual traveling in tie USSR is decideé on the basis of how the individual
is traveling; i,e., whether on a tourist visa, as a rember of a delegation, *
as the invitee of an organization in the USSR, as a former diplomat
stationed in Moscow, as a diplomat not previously stationed in Moscow,

as a member of the Cultural Exchange program, as a student attending

a university in the USSR, etc. There are also various other factors

which affect the determination of which Department or organizational

component of the SCD has the responsibility for a tourist case, These

factors include whether the individual is already suspected of foreign

intelligence connections and whether the i

vidual is a businessman,

In adi on, certain actual tourists in the USSR may never become the

responsibility oi the SCD if the individual is of specific interest to the
FCD.

On pages 148 - 149, NOSENKO is criticized for not knowing at
least some of the substance of the information furnished by George
BLAKE in regard to the CIA-MI-6 program of utilizing tourist agents

inthe USSR. This criticism completely ignored the fact that NOSENKO

made severai references in 1962 to the KGB having such information

According to NOSENKO, the information which was obviously only

partial was furnished to the FCD by the SCD and could only have come
from an agent, .

The previous summary (page 149) also notes that in 1961 C1A
acquired a lengthy Top Secret study on the subject of the use of tourists
by American Intelligence for espionage and operational support in the
Soviet Union (document was iurnished by GOLITSYN following his de-
fection in December 1961). it was noted that the summary contained
references to certain 1958 - 1959 tourists whom the KGB counter-
intelligence identified as Amcrican agents and noted that NOSENKO
claimed he was Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth
Section in this period of time and that he claimed the KGB identified
no American Intelligence agents curing this period of time. What later
is described as a claim by NOSENKO is neither an accurate reflection
of what NOSENKO said prior to 1967 or has said since 1967.

of these travelers woulc have been the reuponsibility of a section in

the Seventh Departinent, other than the American-Britisa Commen-
wealth Section, or another Department in the SCD, NOSENKO was
quite aware that certain of the American touriste in 1958 - 1959 were
acting suspiciously from a KGB point of view,

NOSENKO has stated he was aware that a document which the
Seventh Department had prepared and furnished to the FCD in an effort
to obtain further assistance from the FCD in the work against tourists
nad been compromised by GOLITSYN. NOSENKO stated he was not in
the Seventh Department when the document was prepared and did not
review the document until after the defection of GOLITSYN and foliow-
ing advice from the FCD to the Seventh Department, SCD, that the
dncument had been compromised. The document furnished by GOLITSYN
has never béen reviewed with NOSENKO to determine if it contained
additional information not in the document which he was aware had
been prepared by the Seventh Department for the FCD.

It ip not believed that the sted failures of NOSENKO to identify
CIA officers are of particular significance in establiehing that be wae

kaown factors wuich would need to be considered. Despite our ascump-
tions as to what the KGB knows, it {s possiblo that () the KGB did not
know of the CIA affiliation of these people, (b) the information known
te the KGB was not available at the First Section, First Department,
level, or (c) information available to the Chief of the Firat Section or
toa specific case officer waa of no official concern to NOSENKO and
was not made available to him. The last of these possibilities lo
suggested in epite of claims by NOSENKO that he had to have known
whatever was known in tha Section regarding CIA identifications; a
propensity on the part of NOSENKO to exaggerate the area of his own
knowledgeability hse been ceen eleewhere in thie cage.

F, NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the

American-British Commonweaith Section and was thereafter a

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible. (Previous

conclusion)

The conclusion of this summary is that NOSENKO was Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section (First Section) from
January 1962 to July 1962 and that he was.a Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Department thereafter.

NOSENKO has. stated that, although he was offered the position
of a Deputy Chief of the First Department, SCD, by Oleg M. CRIBANOV,
Chief, SCD, and although an order bad been prepared and was in the
Personnel Directorate, he declined the proffered position.

According to NOSENKO, he knew that Sergey Mikhaylovich
FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the First Department, did not want NOSENKO
as a Deputy Chief, but instead wanted to promote Vladislav KOVSHUK,

then Chief of the First Section, to the position, FEDOSEYEV was

co0L218



willing to promote NOSENKO to the position of Chief, First Section.

However, GRIBANOV cid aot h to promote KOVSHUK and NOSENKO
considered that under the circumstances it would be better for him to i
return to the Seventh Department rather than to become a Deputy to
FEDOSEYEV who wanted KOVSHUKas a Deputy,

Vladimir Dmitriyevich CHELNOKOV had offered NOSENKO the
position of Chief-of the First Section, Seventh Department, pending the
reassignment of BALDIN to Germany at which time NOSENKO would
become a Deputy Chief, Seventh Department, replacing BALDIN. The
above explanation of NOSENKO seems plausible and credible and indi-
cates that GRIBANOV, the Chief of the SCD, for reasons best known to enone
GRIBANOV, was assisting NOSENKO in his career in the KGB.

This section actually covers two periods in the claimed career
of NOSENKO; namely, January - July 1962 as Chief of the First Section,
and July 1962 - January 1964 as a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Depart~ :
ment, Since NOSENKO oc in Geneva, Switzerland, from March to
June 1962, he actually cannot be seriously faulted for not having de~
tailed knowledge of the activities of the First Section during January -

July 1962. The previous summary (pages 268 - 291) contains remarks

in regard to the January - July 1962 period, including the period of

March ~ June 1962 when he was in Geneva. Four specific tourist cases sec ateene

fication,

the Seventh Department was not concerned wita foreigners visiting
relatives in the USSR nor with Soviet expatriates, NOSENKO, accord=

Soviet citizen and the summary stated that his plan to visit relatives

In regard to the statement that the Seventh Department was not
concerned with foreigners visiting relatives in the USSR nor with Soviet
expatriates, this is not in agreement with current information from
NOSENKO, * Cases of "true" tourists, which were normally the respon-
sibility of the Seventh Department, could become the responsibility of

tioned a number of items of which the KGB was aware concern-
ing his background and occupation irom his visa application, there is no
specific reference in these interviews indicating his statement of purpose
in visiting the USSR.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary revicws remarks by
NOSENKO on the Boris BELITSKIY case and cetates that his claimed role
in the case was not plausible, There are several s}ccific points made in
the summary which imply that NOSENKO was lying about his knowledge of
the case, Taere is adequate reason to believe that NOSENKO exaggerated
his own 1962 role in that NOSENKO now states he was to give assistance
to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV in the handling of BELITSKIY in Geneva
in 1962 and rot to supervise ARTEMOV,

The more important aspect and the primary one is the difference in
what NOSENKO specifically reported about the BELITSKIY case and infor~
mation from the actual CIA record of the case, There are major difier-
ences and without going into all the details of the case which is very involved,
‘an effort has been made toward determining whether these apparent differ-
ences necessarily indicate that NOSENKO was or is lying or whether there
is a possibility he is relating the actual KGB version of the case.

NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY was a KGB agent whom

American Intelligence recruited in London in 1960 or 1961 and that the

KGB purpose in running the operation was to-lure American Intelligence
into meeting BELITSKIY inside the USSR. The previous summary stated
that NOSENKO did not know when the BELITSXI. operation started

(Brussels, Belgium, 1958}, did not know the nature of the British
involvement, did n:t know the operational details and contact arrange=
ments BELITSKIY had with CIA, and did not know BELITSKIY's pattern
of activity in Moscow or Geneva.

NOSENKO during current interviews has indicated an awareness
that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use
BELITSKIY against the British. However, he still has dated the recruit-
ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in London and still states that the
primary purpose of the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in
contacts with BELITSKIY within the USSR, The latter was considered
completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSXIY was recruited in
Brussels, Belgium, in 1958; that three letters had been mailed to
BELITSKIY in the USSR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY
had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR.

There are at this time sufficient unresolved questions in the
BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis-
exepancies between the statements by NOSENKO on the BELITSKIY

case and the actual record are a reflection against NOSENKO,

vot224

the other hand, there is some reason to believe NOSENKO has
furnished the actual KGB version of the BELITSKIY case and that the

KGB, at least as of 1962,

id not now the true story of tae relation-
ship of BELITSKIY with CIA, There is a distinct possibility the
KGB believed the BELITSXIY recruitment occurred in 1961 in London
and BELITSKIY did not then nor has he since admitted to the KGB
uis association with CIA actually started in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium. -
As a possible reason why BELITSKIY would have told the KGB in
1961 a partial story of his contact with American Intelligence, some:
at present unknown event may have occurred in 1961 which caused
BELITSKIY to believe his security was endangered and as a result ;
he told the KGB of certain events in London in 1961, relating these
events as being the original approach to BELITSKIY by GIA.

The following are certain of the points which suggest the KGB
actually considered that BELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in London

,

in 1961 and that BELITSKIY may have never told the KGB of the
developments in his case prioz to 196];

(a) BELITSKIY was in London in April 1960 at which
time he was in contact with a British citizen who was also”
xeporting to MI~5, This individual reported information
received from BELITSKIY which may have been a lead to

George BLAXE, (It seems highly uniixely the KGB would
ever have directed BELITSKIY to furnish information which
may have been a lead to George BLAKE, or at least could
have caused the employees of the unit in which BLAKE was
employed frém June 1959 to August 1960 to come under
suspicion as having passed information to Soviet Intelligence. }
(b) NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY, aiter he went

to Geneva in 1962, managed to reinitiate contact with CIA

rather quickly because he met a girl he had previously known
whom he was sure was an American Intelligence agent and

that she must have reported his presence in Geneva to American
Intelligence, (If the BELITSKIY case had been controlled by the
KGB irom its inception in 1958, the KGB would have known of
the internal mailings to BELITSKIY and the fact that BELITSKIY
had a cover address ae the Soviet Union through which to
initiate contact, However, if BELITSKIY did not tell the KGB
anything about his contacts with CIA prior to 1961 and-then

gave only a partial story of what happened in London in 1961,
BELITSKIY would not have told the KGB of the internal mail-

ings to BELITSKIY in the USSR or the fact that he long had

a cover address outside the USSR. BELITSKIY therefore

As previously indicated, the conclusion is there are a sufficient
number of unresolved questions in the BELITSKIY case so that discrep-
ancies between information {:om NOSENKO and the actual record in the
BELITSKIY case cannot at present be considéred as a reilection against
NOSENKO, and there is a distinct possibility the KGB actually did not
know the true facts of the BELITSKIY case,

The previous summary noted on page 106 that Nataliya SHULGINA
was an Intourist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO in 1955, It also
noted that NOSENKO had stated Boris BELITSKIY “reported to the KGB

..that CIA had warned BELITSKIY against SHULGINA."" The previous
summary stated BELITSKIY reported to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB
agent and "CIA did not warn BELITSKIY,"

There appears to be no doubt at this time that the statement by
NOSENKO that BELITSKIY reported the "CIA had warned BELITSKIY
against SHULGINA," is a reasonably accurate description of what actualy
happened in May 1962 during Agency contacts with BELITSXIY in Geneva.
The record reflects that BELITSKIY stated SHULGINA had confidentially
told him of her status as a KGB agent, stating she had been doubled by
the KGB after having been forcibly recruited by American Intelligence

" while previously in Pazie, France.

(on

it was determined there was no collateral information which
would indicate that the staternent by SHULGINA had any factual basis
and BELITSKIY was warned SHULGINA may have been acting on behaif
of the KGB in stating to BELITSKIY she had been "forcibly recruited by
American Intelligence" at a previous date, It was also suggested to
BELITSKIY that he should go to the KGB as a loyal Soviet citizen and
report the apparent indiscretion of SHULGI“A,

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary, in connection with
the BELITSKIY case, made reference to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV,
It was stated that ARTEMOV had been involved with a series of America:
tourist agents in the Soviet Union and although NOSENKO was allegedly
familiar with ARTEMOV, he was unaware of the involvement of ARTEMOV,
with American tourist agents in 1958 - 1959, The summary noted this
was during a period when NOSENKO claimed to have been Deputy Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section of the Seventh Depart~
ment, Although not specifically stated, the above suggested ARTEMOV
was actually in the Seventh Department in 1958 ~ 1959 and that NOSENKO
was not even aware ARTEMOV was in the Seventh Department. NOSENKO
has consistently stated that ARTEMOV was assigned to the First Section,
First Department, from the time he entered into the KGB in approxi-
mately 1957,

{

A closer examination of the cases described in the previous
summary as "CIA American tourist agents," reveals there is no con-
flict in the involvement of ARTEMOV in these cases and the statement
by NOSENKO that ARTEMOV was with the First Section, First Depart-
ment, Asan example, one of the cases is the case of| Edward MeGOWAN} ele)
NOSENKO has furnished information concerning this case, stating it was
originally a Seventh Department case and that after the mailing of a letter :
by the individual in Minsk, the case was immediately taken over by the
First Department, There is adequate reason to believe ARTEMOV only

became involved after the case was transferred to the First Department,

even traveling under a diplomatic passport, it is, assume the individual

Directorate required or desired support from the SCD, it would normally

Pages 332 - 333 of the previous summary contain the basis
for the previous conclusion that the claim of NOSENKO that he was a
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department from July 1962 to January
1963 was not credible, It is considered that a detailed rebuttal is
not Hecessury since this conclusion was apparently based on inadequate
information. During current interviews, NOSENKO has furnished
details concerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position
which substantiate his claim to having been a Deputy Chief of the
Seventh Department from July 1962 to January 1964.

An example in support of the statement that the previous conclu-
sion was based on inadequate information is the matter of the written
notes which NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 1964.
The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is
inadequate, inaccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews,
an effort had not been made to obtain from NOSENKO a detailed expla
ation of his notes or of how he obtained the information in the notes.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed informa~
tion concerning ail aspects of bis notes. This information suppozts his
claimed position of Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and includes
collateral support to his claim of being Deputy Chief of the First Section,

fererererers

Primarily the OSENKO can be categorized as
follows:
+ (a) Snort case summaries by the Chiefs of the
First Section, Second Section and Sixth Section, Seventh
H Department, NOSENKO has stated that he was in 1962 -

1963 responsibie for supervision over these Sections and
that Filip Denisovich BOBKOV,. Deputy Chief, SCD, who
supervised the Seventh Department, requested a list of all
recruited agents of the Seventh Department, According to
NOSENKO, the order irom BOBKOV was to only retain the
files (cases) of agents in tourist firms and that the files of
other recruited agents should be sent to the FCD or Archives.
NOSENKO has stated that he in turn levied on the Chiefs of
the three Sections the requirement of BOBKOV, but also ex-

panded the request to include ail 1960 - 1962 cases, not

excluding previous cases or cases which had already been
given to the FCD, The notes of NOSENKO included hand-
written reports from the Chief or Acting Chief of each Section
on recruited agents, with information varying from agent to
agent and even including some human errors.

Many of the above cases had previously been trans-

ferred to the FCD, but the remarks of NOSENKO about thei (4232

i
i

inclusion support his statement that he had expanded
the original request irom BOBKOV so that he would have
some "pieces of information to give CIA."

{b) Notes by NOSENKO on other cases which he learned
of during the 1962 = 1963 period. Certain of the notes were
made from a review of a notebook kept by the Chief, Seventh
Department, to which NOSENKO had access on at least two
occasions, Most of his notes were not detailed but were
sufficient to refresh the memory of NOSENKO at a later
date and yet were somewhat innocuous to maintain before
his defection,

(c) Notes for lectures to officers of the Seventh Directorate
prepared while with the First Department, 1960'- 1961, and
the Seventh Department, 1982 - 1963.

(4) Draft report for the briefing of the new Chief, First
Department, in the latter part of 1961. ’

(e) One of three copies of an unregistered report pre-
pared by the Chief, Seventh Department, and two Deputy Chiefs,
including NOSENKO, This was a briefing paper for use by the’
Chief (CHELNOKOV) in an appearance before the Collegium

of the KGB which was reviewing the activitieu of the Seventh

Department. According to NOSENKO, the prepared
report was never typed as a forrnal Gocurnent,

The view has been set forth that NOSENKO took undue risk in

carrying written notes with him out of the Soviet Union, An examination
of this material suggests nat NOSENKO was using extrerne care in
collecting material and was not attempting to obtain decuments, the
possession of which might be incriminating or which if he had brought
out would have been immediately missed, Instead, he collected a con-
siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with
little or no fear that a search of his effects in the KGB aiter his depart-
ure for Geneva would disclose that certain material was missing. None
of the material was registered and all could have previously been des-
troyed by NOSENKO,

The previous summary stated that NOSENKO brought three KGB
documents to Geneva. These were typed papers but none was registered
or actually accountable. The reference to three documents was to;

(a) The drait report for the briefing of the Collegium
which has been mentioned previously.
(b) A.typed two-page report on several cases, Actually
a Chief of Section had typed his notes on cases instead of

submitting in handwriting as the others did.

(c) A second copy of a summary on a KGB agent.
NOSENKO stated that there were two copies in the file
kept by the Ch-2f which he reviewed and that he kept one.
Of interest is the fact that the copy wae not a registered
document and did not contain the usual information as to

number of copies typed.

G, NOSENKO

sno valid claim to certainty that the KGB

recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and his

Gefection in 1963, (Previous conclusion)

The conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO is of the

opinion that there were no KGB recruitments of United States Embassy
personnel in Moscow between 1953 and December 1963 with the exception
of "ANDREY" (Dayle Wailis SMITH) and jorbest HOWARD] who actually
was employee but did work part of the time in the Embassy.

The question here is whether or not the expressed opinion of
NOSENKO is sufficiently based on actual knowledge so that this opinion

can be accepted as absolute evidence that there were no other KGB

recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time. -The

only logical conclusion is that the opinion of NOSENKO cannot be
accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, ‘there is a possibility that

a recruitment could have occurred and NOSENKO not be aware in any
way of the ata This should in no way be interpreted as a
suggestion that NOSENKO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased
observer without personal knowledge could and should be hesitant to
accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO in this particular area.

The actual basis for the stated opinion of NOSENKO. 1 be
woeemgoU Lede

examined and can be cited as follows.

SECRET



Marca 1953-late May 1955 NOSENKO
was a case officer in the First Section, First Department,
SCD, _NOSENKO does not claim that he would ave known
the detaiis concerning any recruitments (other than
"ANDREY") in this period, but states if there had been
he would have heard "something. " i

(o) During late May 1955 to December 1959 NOSENKO
was in the Seventh Department, not the First Department,
but continued to have contact with certain officers in the
First Section, First Department. NOSENKO is of the
opinion that if there had been a recruitment in the United
States Embassy during this period he would have heard
"something" even though he would probably have learned

; few details.

(c) During the January 1960-December 1961 period
NOSENKO was Deputy Chies of the First Section, First
Department, and he has made the categorical statement
that there were no reeruitments by the KGB of United
States Embassy personnel during this period of time.

He has also stated that if there had been any recruitments
during the 1953-1959 period he is sure he would, during
1960-1961, have heard or learned some details of thg}0){233

case or cases, There is merit to this contention by

2
ernnrr



a

NOSENKO since the Chief of Section was Viadislav
KOVSHUK who had been an officer of the First Depart-
meni since 1953, actually working in the First Section
exeept for the periods of time that he was in the United
States to reactivate "ANDREY" in 1957-1958 and a
period of time that he was Deputy Chief of the First
Department. ‘ ;

{a) During 1962-1963 NOSENKO was again in the
Seventh Department, However, he continued to maintain
contact with certain officers of the First Section, First
Department: in particular, Gennadiy I. GRYAZNOV,
who succeeded NOSENKO as Deputy Chief of the First
Section, taen became Chief of Section, and in the latter
part of 1963 became a Deputy Chief of the First Department.

According to NOSENKO his relationship with
GRYAZNOV was sufficiently close during 1962-1963 that
he is sure GRYAZNOV would have furnished NOSENKO
some information in regard to any successful recruitments
of United States Embassy personnel, NOSENKO pointed
out that he learned of the existence of the [Herbert Sovran
case from GRYAZNOV in 1962, although it was not until

1963 that NOSENKO heard the name. NOSENKO actually
i 0001239

= SECRET

learned of the name when the First Section, First
Department, needed the services of the Seventh
Department (Third Section) in obtaining a room ina

06 : b
certain hotel for the Soviet girl friend offowan} :
: 1

In gonaral the above constitutes the basis for the stated opinion

06
of NOSENKO that "ANDREY" and[Herbert HOWARD]were the only

euccessful KGB recruitmente during 1953 - December 1963, It should 1
be noted that there are no other identified KGB recruitments during i
this period of time which would specifically refute the opinion of |
NOSENKO. However, in view of the cited actual basis for the opinion

of NOSENKO, acceptance of the opinion of NOSENKO as being an

|
i
i

honest opinion should not be converted into a statement that it is

absolute proof that another recruitment could not have occurred.

NOSENKO may be completely correct in his opinion, but since

NCSENKO was only in the First Department 1953 - 1955 and 1960 ~ 196)

his opinion that he wovld have heard “something” about a recruitment

in 1955 - 1959 or 1962 - 1963 tannot be accepted as infallible.

he had taken from the First Sec
