” MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : S$. D. Breckinridge
Deputy Inspector General

SUBJECT : Comments on Book V, SSC Final.Report, The
Investigation of the Assassination of President
Kennedy: Performance of the Intelligence Agencies

1. Forwarded herewith is the report of a review that Mr.
Knoche requested last fall. The undersigned was designated. as
chairman or coordinator of an Agency working group that was to
conduct the study. It proyed a more ambitious undertaking. than
had been anticipated. The extensive files of CI Staff on the
Warren Commission inquiry into President Kennedy's assassination
were reviewed in detail, as were the very large file holdings of
LA Division on its Cuban operations during the period preceding
and following the death of President Kennedy. The most pains-
taking review and analysis was required, and the files proved to
be so extensive that the research became a major task. The files
of the Office of Security and the Office of the Inspector General
Presented a less formidable problem.

2. The attached report, with its annexes, is the formal
result of the effort. If the attachments seem bulky, it is
noted that additional back-up materials are being held for the” Tr
record in the event of future inquiry. These papers represent :
the result of a conscientious and painstaking effort,-¢onducted
with high standards of review and testing kept foremost in mind.
We believe that there is little likelihood of oversight.or omission
in coverage; the work was so extensive and carefully done that we
feel there is small chance of surprises remaining in CIA files on
this subject. -
1

3. In brief, we found that many of the presentations of
Book V of the Final Report of the Senate Select Committee were
based on incomplete information or distorted perceptions. While
the record of CIA was not perfect, the performance at the time,
under the understanding of the period, seems reasonable. The fact
remains that evidence of a Castro conspiracy to assassinate President
Kennedy still has not been discovered. The Warren Commission and



13-00000

CIA could well have perceived the usefulness of inquiring into
specific sources of possible provocation of Castro at the time of
the 1964 investigation; it is clear that the general consideration
was recognized by all concerned, and pursued, but the concept of
specific possible provocations was not. A review into such possi-
bilities has now been conducted, with essentially negative results.

4. The report ts not to be constdered a report of the
Inspector General, as such, being the result of a representative
working group. However, the report should be considered as being
for internal CIA consumption only. It contains third agency reports,
liaison reports, and involves sources and methods materials, as well
as evaluation and comment of a nature that is advisory to manage-
ment. Any release of this report and its annexes outside the Agency,
even in classified form, would require considerable sanitization.

It is recommended that this report be held against future inquiries,

-providing a basis for appropriate responses, and that it not be

volunteered at this time.

SUBJECT: Comments on Book V of the Final Report of the U.S. Senate
Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities
1. Book V of the SSC Final Report, titled The Investigation

of the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy: Performance of the

Intelligence Agencies, presents. a number of issues that address themselves
to the conscience of the Agency. The criticisms of CIA are based on a
series of presentations of how various investigative leads were handled,
and on the non-reporting of various Agency operational activities that
the SSC Final Report judges to have been relevant to the Warren
Commission inquiry.

2. A stated thesis of the SSC Final Report is that the operations
of the intelligence agencies against Cuba exercised a negative influence
on the quality of their support for the Warren Commission investigation.
The following statements appear in the Report:

"It (the SSC Report) places particular
emphasis on the effect their Cuban opera-
tions seemed to have on the investigation."
Page 2.

"They (senior CIA officials) should have
realized that CIA operations against Cuba,
particularly operations involving the
assassination of Castro, needed to be con-
sidered in the investigation. Yet, they
directed their subordinates to conduct

an investigation without telling them of

these vital facts." Page 7.

; CONFIDENTIAL

The significance of these statements, to the authors of the SSC,
Report, is highlighted as follows:
“Certainly, concern with public reputation,
problems of coordination between. agencies,
possible bureaucratic failure and embarrassment,
and the extreme compartmentation of knowledge
of sensitive operations may have contributed to
these shortcomings. But the possibility
exists that senior officials in both agencies
made conscious decisions not to disclose
potentially important information." Page 7.

A central feature of the rationale is the concept that if Castro
had learned of these activities it would have provoked him into
retaliation against President Kennedy. The SSC Final Report makes
it clear that it feels this theory should have been perceived and
accepted at the time by the intelligence agencies (not to mention
the Warren Commission) leading to a review of the various anti-Castro
programs to see what it might reveal.

The provocation theory, in the specific form postulated by the
SSC Final Report and the press, is of more recent vintage than the
perceptions that prevailed in 1964 when the Warren Commission was con-
ducting its investigation. There was a general concern in 1964 that

the USSR or Cuba might be behind the assassination of President

2

13-00000

Kennedy. This was based on a more broadly recognized understanding
of the tensions that existed between the Kennedy administration and the
Soviet and Cuban regimes. The Bay of Pigs in 1961 and the Cuban
Missile Crisis in 1962 must have appeared remarkably provocative to
Fidel Castro, along with the array of American anti-Cuban programs.
The humiliation of the USSR in having to retreat in the Cuban Missile
Crisis cannot be dismissed completely as to how it might have been
perceived by a foreign power as a provocation. To note these events
serves only to remind the reader of the tensions well recognized at
the time. The SSC Final Report has elected to emphasize instead CIA
operational activity against Cuba as requiring specific attention.
This emphasis on CIA's Cuban operations as a possible source of
provocation of Castro represents the result of an evolution in percep-
tions. In response to it we undertook an extensive review of the
various. operational activities against Cuba and Castro.

Organization for the Review

As there are no persons now in CIA who were directly involved
at a senior level in the investigation of 1964, it was felt necessary
to organize a fresh approach to the matter. The persons who, in 1963
and 1964, knew the details of the various operational activities are
no longer available, for the most part, to provide the current and
detailed factual familiarity that existed at the time of the investi-

gations. Primary reliance had to be placed instead on the records for

the period preceding President Kennedy's death and the period following
it.

It was determined that a special research effort would be mounted
to review those Agency files that might relate to this problem. The
organization for this research is ‘summarized at Tab A of this paper.

It required not only the meticulous review of all Cuban operations,

it necessitated careful analysis of the content and nature of the oper-
ations with special attention to their security. Files relating to the
Warren Commission inquiry were reviewed as well as those relating to
plotting against Castro.

The results of the efforts of those assigned to the task are
contained in this covering report and in the separate annexes to it,
Tabs B through G.

CIA has now conducted such a review -- looking at "the other end"
of a possible chain of evidence, where things theoretically could have
started. This has produced no new evidence bearing on the assassination,
although it has produced the basis for new lines of speculation. In
fact, the review sometimes seemed to become a futile exercise in trying
to fit facts to the provocation theory rather than being able to
identify evidence actually bearing on the assassination of President

Kennedy. The emphasis sometimes became one of asking if this activity



13-00000

CONFIDENTIAL

(whichever was under review) could have provoked Castro to order the
assassination of President Kennedy, had he (Castro) learned of it.
The SSC, in its Final Report, fell into this very trap, trying to make
the AMLASH operation actually fit the theory for which the SSC's
presentation seemed to be tailored. (See Tab D.)

We have looked at other operational activities with the SSC's
theory in mind, but have been unable to provide tangible substance
in support of the theory. In the final analysis the reviewer is
compelled to fall back on the evidence. A wide variety of theories
can be--as they have been--advanced in strident and challenging tones.
Not all of them are susceptible to conclusive answers; the primary
possibility of finding such answers was lost with the death of Lee
Harvey Oswald. The fact is that the Warren Commission considered the
possibility of Cuban or Soviet involvement, but could not find evi- |
dence of it. Were it known at the time of the Warren Conmission, it
would have been reported and dealt with then; that it was not is a
simple reflection of the fact that it did not exist at that time in
the minds of Americans knowledgeable on the subject. To hold dif-
ferentiy would be to accept uncritically a social paranoia often
prevalent today, which would hold that a significant number of
government employees could engage in such a well-disciplined con-

spiracy to suppress evidence.

Operations Against Castro

The AMTRUNK Operation, starting in 1963, sought to develop a
capability to join dissident elements among the Cuban leadership into
a group that could oust the Castro regime. It was conceived by Cuban
exiles and sold to the Kennedy Administration, which assigned it to
CIA. The program was very slow in developing substance and momentum,
with little concrete progress during President Kennedy's life. Ata
later date, in 1965, it was believed to be compromised and CIA withdrew
from its association; the key members were arrested later and tried in
Cuba. There are basic questions about the security of the activity
from its inception, due to the involvement of personalities who are
suspected of having pro-Cuban sympathies, including possibly having
been foreign. agents. While the suspicions cannot be verified, the
reservations are sufficiently basic to consider the possibility that
Castro knew of the operation from its earliest days. Its long range
objectives--the overthrow of Castro and his regime--would have been an
irritant to Castro; its inability to develop any substance and momentum
until long after President Kennedy's death suggests that it is unlikely
that it, of itself, would have moved him at that time to resort to
assassination in retaliation. This is discussed at Tab’ C.

Operation AMLASH centered on a high-level Cuban official, AMLASH/1,
who had expressed his opposition to Castro and to the Castro regime.
The SSC Final Report undertakes to demonstrate that the operation planned

Castro's assassination during the period preceding the murder of



13-00000

CWFOERTAL 3

President Kennedy; to the contrary, a full review of the operation
shows that prior to the President's assassination not only had CIA
not agreed to give any support to AMLASH/1, but had rejected his
proposals to assassinate Castro. When evidence supporting this view
was offered the drafters of Book V of the SSC Final Report, it was
dismissed out of hand as false, despite confirming evidence. The SSC
Report, instead, having asserted that assassination was the character
of the operation at that time, then undertook to show that AMLASH/1
was at least indiscreet in his conduct, risking exposure of the plot.
Alternatively, it suggested that he may have been acting for Castro
as a provocateur, to lead the United States into a plot against
Castro's life which in turn was then to provide Castro with the
justification to order President Kennedy's assassination. In either
event, had Castro learned about the relationship between AMLASH/1 and
CIA he would have known only that there was an inconclusive association
that certainly had not progressed to the point that it constituted the
basis for the postulated provocation. This is discussed in some detail
at Tab D of this paper.

The SSC Final Report discounts (at page 68) the possibility that
actual plotting by CIA with the criminal syndicate served as a source
for provocation for Castro to have President Kennedy murdered. There
are new considerations that developed in the course of the present
review that throw more light on the role of the criminal syndicate,
but they do not provide a basis.for taking issue with the judgment of
the SSC Final Report, which dismissed the activity as having provided

Castro with the postulated provocation. This is discussed at Tab C.

Items Selected by the SSC for Critical Comment

The SSC Final Report picked out a number of selected subjects for
treatment in support of its criticism of the thoroughness of the in-
vestigation by the intelligence agencies. One of these had to do with
the allegations in Mexico City by a man designated as “D". These al-
legations were demonstrated conclusively by the Warren Commission to
have been false; why they are discussed at all in the SSC Final Report
is a question in itself. In another instance, reference is made to a
reported five-hour delay of a Cubana flight from Mexico City, awaiting
arrival of a private aircraft with a mysterious passenger; not only
was the Cubana flight on the ground for four hours (in contrast to -the
alleged five hour delay in departure) it departed an hour before the
alleged arrival of the private aircraft. After CIA reported on a
Cuban-American who departed on another Cubana flight, the FBI investi-
gated the man extensively, as is revealed by the information available
for use in the SSC Final Report; a single report that caused him to be
dramatized is so full of errors as to be highly suspect, essentially
being placed in doubt by other evidence in the record. In another
instance considerable emphasis was given by the SSC Final Report to a
cable from the Mexico City Station, replying to a 23 November 1963 in-
quiry from CIA headquarters asking for reports on contacts with certain
named Soviets. The true name of AMLASH/1 was given in the Mexico City
reply, but not as having had contact with the Soviets -- which was the

purpose of the inquiry -- but as the subject of a meeting in December

CONFIDENTIAL


13-00000

CONFIDENTIAL

1960 between a functionary of the Cuban embassy with a Soviet, concern-
ing a press conference to be held in Mexico City by AMLASH/1 in February
and March 1961. AMLASH/1's name could have been omitted from the cable
altogether, so far as its having any relevance to the inquiry about
persons having contact with Soviets is concerned. In any event, the
meeting in December 1960 was prior to President Kennedy's inauguration,
which removes it yet further from any possible relevance to the subject
matter. It really is not difficult to understand why the reference to
AMLASH/1's name did not lead to detailed research about him. This is
discussed further at Tab D.

Conclusions

Basically, the research effort for the present paper produced two
general conclusions. First, the SSC Final Report contains numerous
factual errors, both in the extensive treatment of a selected opera-
tion (AMLASH) and in a number of separate incidents that it presents.
Second, while one can make the point in principle that the Warren
Commission could well have broadened its review to include the anti-
Cuban programs of the U.S. Government, in trying to make the case for
that concept Book V of the SSC Final Report went to such lengths in its
treatment as to detract from the point at hand. It is difficult to
characterize it more generously.

In a very real sense, the SSC Final Report has compounded the
problem of public perception. On a flawed presentation it has accused
the intelligence agencies of derelictions and worse. While it has
reinforced the public sense of unfinished business yet to be done, it

has so badly beclouded the issue as to have done a disservice to

9

CONFIBER TAL

future attempts at objective and dispassionate inquiry. .
While one can understand today why the Warren Commission limited
its inquiry to normal avenues of investigation, it would have served
to reinforce the credibility of its effort had it taken a broader
view of the matter. CIA, too, could have considered in specific
terms what most saw then in general terms--the possibility of Soviet
or Cuban involvement in the assassination because of tensions of
the time. It is not enough to be able to point out erroneous
criticisms made today. The Agency should have taken broader _
initiatives then, as well. That CIA employees at the time felt--as
they obviously did--that the activities about which they knew had
no relevance to the Warren Commission inquiry does not take the place
of a record of conscious review. The present research effort has
undertaken to conduct such a review; it is noted that the findings
are essentially negative. However, it must be recognized that CIA
cannot be as confident of a cold trail in 1977 as it could have
been in 1964; this apparent fact will be noted by the critics of
the Agency, and by those who have found a career in the questions
already asked and yet to be asked about the assassination of

President Kennedy.

ORGANIZATION FOR AND CONDUCT OF REVIEW

Organization for and Conduct of the Review

1. Many years have-passed since the inquiry by the Warren Com-
mission. The persons who were most familiar with the activities
of the Agency during the period preceding the death of President
Kennedy, and during the investigation of the Warren Commission, are
no longer in place in the same work. Some of the employees have
retired or have been transferred to other work. Some have died.

2. To respond to the questions raised in Book V of the SSC
Final Report, it was necessary to review old files and to assign to
this undertaking personnel not really familiar with the activities
of the Agency during a period of a dozen or more years before. A
study group was established to consider the size of the problem and
to develop a plan for conducting the review. Chaired by a repre-
sentative from the Office of the Inspector General, the group also
consisted of members from CI Staff, LA Division, and the Office of
Security. Terms of Reference for the review were agreed upon in
early August 1976. Points emphasized for the review, because of the
thrust of Book V of the SSC Final Report, were (1) to conduct a full
review of information and operations on the Cuban target to identify
any activity that might relate to the assassination of President Kennedy,
and (2) to review the possibility that CIA activities against Cuba

did, by their nature, cause Castro to order the assassination of

President Kennedy. A copy of the Terms of Reference is attached.

3. The two main holdings of files for the period in question
were in LA Division and CI Staff, of the Directorate of Operations,
with less voluminous files being held in the Office of Security. and
the Office of the Inspector General. The organization for the review
of those files is described below.

4. LA Division: LA Division was the repository of the files
for Agency operations conducted against Cuba. These files were known
to be extensive. Under the Terms of Reference those files for the
period 1 January 196] to 1 January 1965 were selected for review,
covering a three-year period prior to the death of President Kennedy
and the following year. A research group was formed composed of
five full-time researchers, a group leader and a task force supervisor.
An additional four researchers participated in different phases of
the research, which continued to mid-May 1977.

5. Reference to material for this research was obtained from
the LA Division registry, the Cuba Desk machine runs, and a special
comprehensive file listing prepared for this purpose by Information
Services Staff (ISS). On the basis of this it was originally believed
that material pertinent to the search would number approximately 900
operational folders, plus numerous related 201-files. It was later
determined, however, that a thorough review should include additional
operational and subject files which brought the total to well over

two thousand files. In view of the date of the material, much of it,

both operational and subject, had been retired to Archives at

The remainder is held at Headquarters in the

files or archival material of Information Processing Group. This
material is easily retrievable through the use of specific job
numbers and file reference numbers recorded and retained in the
LA Division research group files (too numerous to cite herein).

6. Following is a breakdown of the types and numbers of files
reviewed, criteria employed in the research, the findings, and
organization of the material:

brought to its attention by the IG Staff, on an ad hoc basis,
and to additional questions raised in the course of the
study. A name trace was always run, and/or the 201-file was
reviewed, if available, on any individual allegedly involved
in an assassination plot against President Kennedy or Fidel
Castro. This task was made somewhat easier as the result of
a memorandum prepared by the Cuba Desk, in August 1975,

based on traces of the names in the so-called Black Book —
that Fidel Castro passed to Senator McGovern, which dealt
with individuals the Cubans alleged were involved in assassi-
nation attempts against Castro.

c. Findings and Organization of the Findings

Each researcher submitted a draft paper noting the
subject of the folder(s) reviewed, a brief description of the
activity, and a copy of those document(s) or findings which
contained information believed to be pertinent to the review.
Also included were job numbers, official file numbers,
inclusive dates of material researched, and the number of
volumes reviewed. Beginning in January 1977, at the request
of the IG Staff, the researchers also began noting FBI and/or
other government agencies knowledge of information, to the
extent recorded in Agency files. Separate finished memoranda
were prepared, on the basis of these data, including the
heading Findings. This heading lists the specific document

number(s) and other pertinent data, and a few lines providing

the gist of the document(s) for purpose of easy and quick

reference. These memoranda, with a copy of the document(s)

attached, are filed in alphabetical order, by project and
subject, in hard-back green folders as part of the official

LA Division research group files under the official classi-

fication number 019-604-001 (Volumes XI through XX). Also

included in the records are two folders (Volumes IX and X)

containing 1,439 draft memoranda with negative findings. —

These records are restricted in LA Division.

7. The LA Division research effort proved to be far more
complex than originally estimated. Research continued to lead to new
files, and the requirements for meticulous analysis and correlation
of material further extended the time required to complete the under-
taking. By completing this exhaustive review of files the Agency
can speak with considerable confidence as to what the records of
Cuban operations show, so far as they relate to the question of the
death of President Kennedy.

8. CI Staff: CI Staff assigned one senior officer to review
its files on Lee Harvey Oswald, working under the general Terms of
Reference referred to above, and also to generate papers on points
not covered by the guidelines ‘but pertinent to the general subject.

9. Since December 1963, the CI Staff has served as the point

of record for all questions relating to Lee Harvey Oswald and the

Agency's role in the investigation conducted by the Warren Com-
mission. The so-called "Oswald File" now fills 57 volumes. comprising
some 142 file folders and portfolios. In addition, the Staff has
accumulated some 50 supplemental files including the master copy
of those documents released under provisions of the FOIA to the public
in March 1976 (first series) and those documents (second series)
released in September 1976 and March 1977.

10. By necessity the documents in the file are held in chrono-
logical order; however, the file has become much more than just a
chronological file on Lee Harvey Oswald. It has now become the
Agency's central repository for information and documentation that
it holds on:

a. The life of Harvey Oswald;

b. The Agency's role in the investigation conducted
by the Warren Commission, 1963--1964;

c. The testimony by various Agency officers before
the several commissions and committees set up to review
the validity of previous investigations. (NB: It should
be pointed out that this portion of this file is not
complete); and

d. The point of record for Agency action taken in
response to requests submitted to the Agency under pro-

visions of the Freedom of Information Act.

11. In order to come to grips with the voluminous material in
the Oswald files, it soon became obvious that, in’order to be in
a position to respond effectively and expeditiously to the Terms of
Reference and to allegations and accusations in Book V of the SSC
Final Report, it would be necessary to copy much of the file and to
place these copies in folders set up according to general and specific
subjects. In order to check charges that this Agency had withheld
information from the FBI and the Warren Commission, and that there
was “no evidence that the FBI asked the Agency to conduct an investi-
gation or gather information," the following files were set up:
a. Correspondence from the Warren Commission;
b. Correspondence from the Agency to the Warren
Commission;
c. Agency disseminations to the Intelligence Community,
particularly the FBI;
d. Correspondence from the FBI to the Agency requesting
assistance and information;
e. Chronological summary of information on and actions
taken relating to Silvia Tirado de DURAN; and
f. Chronological summary of information on and actions
taken relating to Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte.
These files provided a basis for checking statements included in the
SSC Final Report and to determine what the Agency actually did do

in relation to the Warren Commission inquiry.

12. The approach to the problem at hand was to assemble by
chronological and statistical compilations the Agency's record on
the matter, (a) its initiation of collection requirements for infor-
mation, and the papers it originated on various aspects of the
investigation for passage to the Intelligence Community, particularly
the FBI and the Warren Commission, and (b) its response to require-
ments and requests levied upon it by the Intelligence Community and
the Warren Commission. Certain parts of the record were summarized
to record what actually happened in those instances in which it
differs from representations in the SSC Report.

13. Office of Security: The Office of Security assigned one
officer to identify material in its records believed to have some
possible relation to the Kennedy assassination. During the course of
this review, approximately fifty subject files were identified as
containing material of some relevance. This material amounted to
the equivalent of approximately two safe drawers. The files reviewed
included volumes on Lee Harvey Oswald, AMLASH, various individuals
connected with the Criminal Underworld Plot, and a collection of
files containing the results of name traces conducted at the time
of the "Garrison Investigation."

14. Office of the Inspector General: The Office of the Inspector

General held the report that it produced in 1967 on plotting against
Castro, as well as related materials accumulated subsequently. It

also received files developed in 1973 in response to a 9 May 1973

request by the DCI to Agency employees concerning questionable
activities. Two members of the Inspection Staff were assigned to
the project, responsible for overall coordination of the research
effort. Additionally, because of the emphasis given to events in
Mexico by Book V of the SSC Final Report, the Office of the Inspector
General employed on contract a retired employee who had served as
a special case officer in Mexico City during the period preceding
President Kennedy's death and during the investigation afterwards.
The retired employee recalled for this task conducted an extensive
review of all Mexico City files and materials held in Headquarters
or retired to Archives. The result of her research is found in
Tabs B and F.

15. The file holdings in the Office of the Inpsector General
are less than one safe drawer. However, the AMLASH file, held by
LA Division/Directorate of Operations, was reviewed by a member of
the Office of the Inspector General, as were parts of the AMTRUNK
file, also held by LA Division. These two activities are discussed
in Annexes D and C, respectively.

16. There were a limited number of interviews to clarify
specific points.

Detailed records of the research undertaken are held in the
respective components participating in this effort. Selected back-
up material for the final report is also held in the Office of the

Inspector General.

TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR REVIEW OF
ISSUES RAISED IN
BOOK V, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

FINAL REPORT

1. The Schweiker Subcommittee has two basic theses--
(1) the. general idea that the intelligence community--primarily
CIA and FBI--did not undertake a full review of the possibility
of Cuban involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy,
and (2) the idea that CIA activities against Cuba were provocative
and may have led to the assassination of President Kennedy. The
former by itself is not too difficult a problem to address. Either
there was or there was not an extensive intelligence collection
program to ascertain all possible information on the subject.
Either there was or there was not an exhaustive review of all
information in the Agency that might in some way relate to this
question. Either the Agency did or did not report what it had
to the Warren Commission for further inquiry and review.

2. The second portion of the Subcommittee's presentation
is somewhat more diffuse and complex. By way of general back-
ground it summarizes Agency and U.S. operations against Castro's
Cuba. ‘There is an inference--almost subliminal--that these
general activities were provocative. More specific, however,
is the detailed treatment of the AMLASH operation as an activity
that the report suggests could have provoked Castro into retaliatory
action against President Kennedy. The failure of CIA to report
this to the Warren Commission, in the context of the provocation
theory, is advanced as a failure to report relevant information,
Detailed treatment of the operation is given in the report in
support of the thesis.

3.. The issue of operational activity that could have provoked
a retaliatory strike by Castro against President Kennedy capnot
be restricted to the AMLASH operation. In itself it may be one of
the poorer examples of something that might have proven so pro-
vocative as to stimulate a retaliatory strike by Castro against
President Kennedy. There were other operations with the un-
qualified objective of killing Castro. These contrast with the
AMLASH affair in which the agreed purpose was not so clear and
in which the sequence of events throws considerable doubt on the
Subcommittee's treatment of the activity in this respect.

a. The following questions are intended to serve as
a guide in a records review of the extent of the Agency's

investigation prior to the end of the Warren Commission.

(1) What collection requirements were issued to
the field with regard to Kennedy's assassination?

(2) What follow-up of these requirements was
there during 1964?

(3) What form did the follow-up take?

(4) Identify and describe the records with regard
to this activity.

(5) What reporting was there from the field in
response to Headquarters! requirements?

(6) What dissemination and review was this
reporting given?

(7) Was dissemination made on this reporting to
the CI Staff?

(8) Was this reporting given to the Warren Commission?

(9) What review of Headquarters! material was
ordered through 1964?



13-00000

ee)

(10) What werethe parameters of these instructions?
(ll) What; responses were there and where are they?

(12) What evidence is there that the "provocation"
theory was considered during the Warren Commission
enquiries, either in CIA or the Warren Commission?

(13) What action was taken with reference to this
concept as a basis for reviewing relating Agency programs?

(14) What records are there on this and where are they?

(15) Were there any efforts made to develop an
Oswald/Cuban connection?

(16) What form did they take? fe

(17) What exchanges were there with the FBI on this
subject?

(18) What action developed from these exchanges?

(19) What records are there on these exchanges and
where are they?

(20) To what extent were elements of the Agency
other than the CI Staff and LA Division involved in in-
vestigating the assassination during thé Warren Commission
tenure?

(21) What is the total CIA information on the two
flights from Mexico City to Havana?

(22) What was done at the time to develop further
information on this matter?

(23) Can further information be acquired on this
matter now?



13-00000

(24) What is the total CIA information on ''D'!?

(25) Is further information on "D" needed in view
of the SSC Subcommittee reference to it?

(26) What information does CIA have on Oswald
FPCC relations?

(27) What does CIA know about the New Orleans
training activity and was anything provided on this to
the Warren Commission?

(28) What is the total CIA information on "A"?
(29) Who is the man photographed in Mexico City?

(30) What is the CIA information on the 4 December
1963 report of an agent meeting Oswald in Cuba?

(31) What is the total CIA information on Cuban
assassination policies and programs up to November 22,
1963?

(32) What is the total CIA information on Castro's
7 September 1963 statements re retribution?

(33) Does the testimony before the SSC of CIA
employees contain anything on the above questions?
If so, what? ~

b. On the subject of possible provocation for the
assassination plots against Castro, each of the known activities
should be reviewed to the extent possible in order to determine
any additional relevant information on this plot.

(1) What is the total information on the plots involving
the criminal syndicates?

(2) Who was witting of the planning for the syndicate
operation? :



13-00000

(3) Are there current considerations on the syndicate
operation not faced previously (e.g.'; a former Office
of Security officer may have knowledge that was not
surfaced in the interviews with him with the SSC or
Agency personnel. Additionally, a former LA Division
career agent may have some insights that could throw
light on one of the operations).

(4) There are a couple of cases based on agent
traffic (reported to the SSC during the study of alleged
assassination plots) indicating plans during the Bay of
Pigs period to shoot Castro. What is the total CIA
information on these?

(5) What is the significance on the subject of
provocation in the book given Senator McGovern by
Castro?

(6) While the AMLASH operation is subject to fairly
detailed reconstruction from a very complete record,
there are points that should be addressed particularly,
because of their treatment in the SSC Subcommittee report.
For instance, is there significance in the fact that CIA
contacted AMLASH/1 in September 1963 after such a
long time? Or was it simply that this was the first time
the opportunity had presented itself since earlier meetings?

(7) Just what did the case officer tell AMLASH/1
when making plans for the 22 November meeting?

(8) What was the security of the relationship with
AMLASH/1 during the period preceding the assassination
of President Kennedy? :

(9) In what time frame was Fitzgerald's Executive
Officer speaking when he stated his judgment that the
AMLASH/1 operation was an assassination plot?



13-00000

‘c. What other action might CIA have taken in connection
with the investigation? An effort should be made to ligt
these, including consultation with surviving officials to
determine not only what they considered the requirement
at the time, but what was omitted and why.

4. In conclusion, these 'Terms of Reference" undertake
to address the entire question of possible provocation of U.S.
policy and CIA programs in the period preceding the assassination
of President Kennedy. An aspect of this is the SSC Subcommittee's
apparent view that CIA assassination plotting could have instigated
a retaliatory strike by Castro against President Kennedy, which,
therefore, should have been reported to the Warren Commission.
Just as importantly, the final paper should reflect findings in the
area of what the Agency did in response to Warren Commission
requirements (both stated by the Warren Commission and those
that could have been conceived by the Agency), and how if pursued
these lines of action and reported them to the Commission. This
will include consideration of specific new and unanswered questions
raised in the Schweiker report

CIA PERFORMANCE ON THE INQUIRIES


13-00000

—CONFIDENTIAC

CIA's Performance on the Inquiries «

Book V of the SSC Final Report challenges the performance of the
intelligence agencies during the Warren Commission inquiry, empha-
sizing things that it feels should have been done but which it asserts

were not.

It is correct to say that CIA has not produced evidence or
analysis that addresses every theory that has been advanced over the
years. A record of the volume of CIA reporting to the FBI and the
Warren Commission is at Tab E. As a practical consideration, évery
theoretical question that can be conceived cannot be answered con-
clusively; there simply may be no evidence at all, or if there is
evidence somewhere it may not be accessible. The issue is what the
intelligence agencies did -- in the present instance, what was the
performance of CIA -- with Book V of the SSC Final Report portraying
a patternof neglect or avoidance that is not supported by the record.

The SSC Final Report offers a number of separate subjects in

support of its case:
a. It refers to an allegation by a person identified as

"Dp" (pages 28-30, 41-42 and 102-103) that he overheard and

saw Oswald being handed money in Mexico City for the purpose
of assassinating President Kennedy; this was proven false, both
by polygraph and by determining that Oswald was in New Orleans
instead of Mexico City at the time the incident was supposed to
have occurred. This subject is treated in a confusing and in-

conclusive manner in the SSC Final Report.

~CORFBENTIAL-


13-00000

b. A considerable portion of the Report is given to the
AMLASH operation. The operation’ is described inaccurately. i
The Report assigns it characteristics that it did not have during
the period preceding the assassination of President Kennedy, in

order to. support the SSC view that it should have been reported

to the Warren Commission. This is treated in some detail at Tab D

of this report.
c. Space is devoted to two aircraft flights from Mexico
City to Havana, on 22 November and 27 November (see pages 60-
63). The first of these flights, as described in the SSC Report,
is based on an inaccurate report about a delay of the 22 November
flight to meet a mysterious private aircraft; the correct story
removes the basis for the inferences of the SSC version. The
second of these flights had to do with a man whose significance
arises from a patently erroneous report; the FBI investigated him
thoroughly, as is apparent from the condensed summary in the SSC
Final Report.
These examples illustrate the problem of commenting on the SSC Final
Report, the question becoming that of how to deal with Congressional

criticism presented on the basis of inaccurate factual perceptions.

To treat the problem it was felt necessary to review the record in-depth

and to report the findings, whatever they are.
Recognizing the possibility of error or oversight in 1964--both
on the part of CIA and the Warren Conmission--consideration was given

to courses of action CIA might have taken to throw some light on the



13-00000

Piboiiiiik

questions as understood at the time, as well as considering those *
questions that have developed since then. What would be the areas of
inquiry? Oswald was an obvious subject of investigation.

Oswald was known to have been out of the country twice subsequent
to his return to private life from the Marine Corps in September 1959.
These overseas adventures were appropriate for CIA attention. The
first of these overseas trips was when he went to the Soviet Union in
October 1959 from which he returned in June 1962. The second of these
trips was when he went to Mexico City in late September 1963, from
which he returned in early October 1963.

In addition to these two areas of obvious specific inquiry for CIA,
there is the problem of general foreign intelligence collection that
might in some way produce information on the subject. The SSC Final
Report adds to these considerations operations being conducted by CIA
as. part of a general U.S. program against the Castro regime. These
four general areas of inquiry are covered below. |

I. Travel to and from the USSR 1959-1962

On 26 November 1963 a cable was sent to Paris, Rome, Madrid,

Brussels, The Hague, London, and Ottawa

giving biographic information on Lee Harvey Oswald. It noted his

discharge from the Marine Corps in September 1959 and his travel to
the Soviet Union in October 1959, including sketchy details as to his
employment and marriage while in the USSR. The cable requested:

“any scrap information which bears on President's

assassination...."

ai


13-00000

CORFQENTIAL

.
On 27 November the various addressee stations replied, with

and London providing additional details on the travel of
Oswald to the USSR. Additionally, London reported that a British

journalist claimed that during his own imprisonment in Cuba in 1959
there was a U.S. gangster there by the name of Santos, who was living
in luxury in jail because he could not return to the U.S.; the source
stated that Santos was "visited frequently by another American
gangster named 'Ruby'." (See pages 24--25, Tab C.)

Also on 27 November Ottawa reported the "delight" of the Cuban
Embassy staff over the assassination of President Kennedy although
the staff was instructed to "cease looking happy in public," in
conformance with instructions from Cuba to "govern their actions by

14-e/
official attitude of Govt to which they accredited." on the

same date, reported that the Soviets were shocked, blaming the
assassination on extreme right-wing elements. Otherwise, the initial
responses produced no other information.

On 29 November The Hague and Frankfurt were queried about Oswald's
travel back from the USSR. This query was followed on 2 December by
a similar cable to Berlin, Frankfurt, Bonn and The Hague. Various
reporting produced details about the travel of Oswald and his wife
from the USSR through Germany and the Netherlands enroute to the
United States in June 1962.

The other stations involved in these inquiries had no traces or

information on Oswald; liaison services were also queried without



13-00000

detailed results although there were some technical operations that
produced peripheral information about the reactions of various groups
under intelligence surveillance. Considerable exchanges were held
with the Warren Commission on Oswald's Soviet record and its possible
significance. No evidence was found tying the Soviet Union to Oswald's
assassination of President Kennedy. Book V of the SSC Final Report,
in not criticising the Agency's performance in this aspect of the
investigation, seems to have accepted it as adequate, and it will

not be detailed here. oe

II. Oswald Mexico Visit -- September-October 1963

The visit by Oswald to Mexico City, in his attempt to get

visas for travel to the Soviet Union and Cuba, has received extensive

+
attention. The details concerning the coverage of Oswald's visit to i
Mexico is treated in another annex to this paper (Tab F); The concern
felt by all initially for the possible significance of Oswald's visit,
and his contacts with the Cuban and Soviet embassies, was obvious at
the time. The following statement is in a cable to Mexico City on
28 November 1963:

"We have by no means excluded the possibility

that other as yet unknown persons may have

been involved or even that other powers may

have played a role. Please continue all your

coverage of Soviet and Cuban installations :

and your liaison with Mexicans."



13-00000

The allegations made by "D," about having seen-Oswald taking money
from Cubans in the Cuban embassy in Mexico City, received intensive
attention from CIA and the FBI, working together closely on the matter,
and with the Mexican authorities. This was demonstrated conclusively
to have been a false allegation. Oswald was in New Orleans at the
time of the reported incident, and the person making the allegations
was demonstrated by polygraph to have been lying. After the allegations
by "D" had been demonstrated to be false, Headquarters made the following
statement to the Mexico City Station on 1 December 1963:

"Pls continue to follow all Teads and tips.

The question of whether Oswald acted solely

on his own has still not. been finally resolved."
Again, on 13 December 1963 the Mexico City Station was cabled as
follows:

“Plse continue watch for Soviet or Cuban reaction

to investigation of assassination, evidence

of their complicity, signs they putting out

propaganda about case. FYI only, Soviet Intel

in India had letters sent to [U.S$. Government]

leaders demanding full investigation of case."
On 17 December 1963 Headquarters forwarded a dispatch to the Mexico
City Station stated as follows:

"\..Mexico City has been the only major

overseas reporter in the case. While this

partly dictated by the facts of Lee Oswald's

DENTIAL


13-00000

life, we have not overlooked the really out-

standing performance of Mexico City's major

assets and the speed, precision, and perception

with which the data was forwarded. Here it was

relayed within minutes to the White House,

[Department of State] and [the FBI].

“Your LIENVOY data, the statements of Silvia

DURAN, and your analyses were major factors in

the quick clarification of the case, blanking

out the really ominous spectre of foreign backing."

Essentially, Oswald's visit to Mexico City was investigated as
thoroughly as possible, producing no evidence there of Soviet or
Cuban complicity in the assassination of President Kennedy. If anything,
events during Oswald's visit there are more subject to being seen as
counter to such a possibility, given his troubles with both Cubans
and Soviets. We do not offer this thought as the final word, but more
simply that if it bears on the subject at all it is inconsistent with
speculation that he had some special relationship with either nation.
It is noted that various allegations have been made in the press

in connection with the House Select Committee on Assassinations
inquiry concerning CIA information regarding Oswald's Mexico visit;
these are commented on at Tab G.

III. General Collection Requirements

On 22 November 1963 all CIA stations abroad received a cable

from Headquarters with the following statement:



13-00000

“Tragic death of President Kennedy requires all i

of us to look sharp for any unusual intelligence

developments. Although we have no reason to

expect anything of a particular military nature,

all hands should be on the quick alert at least

for the next few days while the new President

takes over the reins."

It is appropriate at this point to observe the general reaction
to be expected from such a communication. Without any leads, other
than those arising from Oswald's identification, the requirements to
field stations were necessarily general. General reporting can be
stimulated by general requests, if there is something to report, and
this is what was undertaken. In addition, in any event, intelligence
assets and liaison services overseas are quick to realize the signifi-
cance of important information and will report it on their own initiative.
It is significant, in the light of these considerations, that there has
been the most limited reporting on the subject. Were there relevant
or significant information on the subject it would have been reported
either in responses to the expression of general interest, or
spontaneously, if such information was known to Agency sources.
If one believes that there was a conspiracy, with Oswald involved,

one must accept the likelihood that his fellow conspirators would not
have shared their knowledge beyond the narrow circle of thase directly

involved. Conversely, if there were no conspiracy, there obviously

IDENT

CONFIDENTIAL

would be nothing to report in the first place. The absence of concrete
reporting seems to serve, regardless of which is the case, as the basis
for the apparent SSC view that no collection effort was undertaken.

As has been noted above, there were initial CIA collection re-
quirements to the field. What they could be realistically expected to
produce must be related to whether there was any information to collect
at all, and if so whether it was accessible. The requirements were issued,
but in retrospect it is doubtful that they could produce much of the who-
what-where-when-how information that typifies intelligence collection
reporting. A reflection of the basic nature of the problem is found in
the Headquarters cable to Mexico City on 17 December 1963 (note above)
which contains the following comment about the limited reporting from
other stations:

". . . this partly dictated by the facts of Lee
Oswald's life. . ."

The SSC Final Report speaks in rather unqualified terms at page 10
about the resources of the intelligence agencies, including a description
of “an extensive intelligence network in Cuba," suggesting that it was
only necessary to ask to get. It is correct to say that there were
sources in Cuba able to report on events, such as troop movements, but
there were no penetrations of Castro's inner circle, where any infor-
mation on the subject in question would exist. The distinction apparently
was missed -- or ignored -- by the authors of the SSC Final Report. As
stated by the Miami Chief of Station, quoted at page 58 of the SSC Report:

"Now if you are referring to our capability to conduct
an investigation in Cuba, I would have to say it was
limited."

This does not mean that such assets as there were did not have reporting



13-00000

requirements levied on them, in fact, there was considerable activity
in this respect. In the course of the present review a number of case
officers at the Station during that period have described the frenetic
activity in this respect. The characterization by the Chief of Station
as to passive collection by CIA inside the United States should not be
extended to apply to what was done with reporting assets outside the
United States, as the SSC Final Report attempts to do at the bottom of
page 58.

The SSC Final Report has undertaken to paint this in very different
terms than the record supports. The extensive reporting to the FBI
and the Warren Commission provides a truer reflection of the level of
activity by CIA (see Tab E), even if its sources did not bear on every
question that has been conceived since then.

IV "Unpursued Leads"

At pages 60-67, in Book V of the SSC Final Report, there is a section
that addresses leads that were felt to not have been followed by the
intelligence agencies. This follows the section on CIA's Performance
on the Inquiries. This section first addresses two Cubana flights to
Havana from Mexico City on 22 November (the date of President Kennedy's
murder) and 27 November 1963, raising questions about passengers reported
to be aboard those flights.

By way of background it is noted that during that period Cubana
flights traveled on a round trip basis between Havana and Mexico
City every other day. More specifically, there were flights at this

time on 22 November, 25 November and 27 November. The flights on



13-00000

22 and 25 November to Havana were passenger flights, while the one

on 27 November appears to have been essentially a cargo flight, with
one passenger, the man referred to in the SSC discussion. All flights
to Havana apparently carried some freight.

CIA conducted regular surveillance of Cubana flights, filing cable

reports to Headquarters. There was one CIA surveillance

team (LIFIRE) that observed arrivals and departures of Cubana flights,

reporting any unusual incidents and providing copies of flight manifests.

The also had a surveillance team of its own at the

airport, which provided photographs of passports and also provided copies

of passenger lists. Additionally, a telephone tap operation (LIENVOY)
against the Cuban embassy provided transcripts of conversations with
the Cubana office and the Mexican Airport Control Office.
The 22 November 1963 Flight

At pages 30, 60, 61 and 103 of Book V of the SSC Final Report, i >
reference is made to a reported five-hour delay of a Cubana flight from
Mexico City to Havana the evening of President Kennedy's assassination,
22 November 1963. The SSC Report describes the delay as being from
6:00 P.M. EST to 11:00 P.M. EST. The especially intriguing aspect
of the report was that the reported delay was to await arrival at
10:30 P.M. EST of a private twin-engined aircraft, which deposited
an unidentified passenger who boarded the Cubana aircraft without customs
clearance and traveled to Havana in the pilot's cabin. The SSC Final
Report emphasized CIA's apparent failure to follow up by inquiring

further into the matter.

Book V of the SSC Final Report. states that CIA could not explain,
at the time of the writing of the SSC Report, why there was no record
of a follow-up. In fact, the SSC was advised that the Mexican authori-
ties were asked about the reported flight delay, although there was no
recorded response. The current review revealed additional information
from the surveillance noted above, which bears directly on the subject.
In reviewing that information below, it is noted that the conversion
of Mexico City time to Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the SSC Final
Report tends to distort the time perspective somewhat. Mexico _Ci ty
times are used in the following discussion.

The LIENVOY transcripts record a series of discussions about the
status of the 22 November flight--when it was to arrive and when it
departed. These records show that the flight arrived at the platform
at the airport at 1620 hours Mexico City time; presumably it landed
a few minutes earlier. At one point prior to arrival of the aircraft,
one person speaking on the telephone stated that the aircraft was due
at 1630 hours and “it will go" at 1730, suggesting a quick turnaround
that would have reduced unloading and loading time, as well as
servicing, to a relatively short period. However, the key report on
the departure of the aircraft was a statement at 2040 hours that the
aircraft had taken off five minutes earlier, i.e., 2035 hours.

The following facts stand out, in contrast to the presentation in
the SSC Final Report:

1. The Cubana flight was on the ground in Mexico City

for a total of four hours and about ten minutes. It was not



13-00000

CONFIDENTIAL
delayed five hours, as alleged. a

2. The Cubana flight took off at 2035 hours Mexico City
time, 55 minutes ahead of the alleged arrival at 2130 of a
private flight with a secret passenger. This also contrasts
further with the alleged departure time of the Cubana flight.
which the report stated to be 2200. Actual departure preceded
substantially the reported arrival of the aircraft for which it
allegedly was delayed.

In view of the surveillance coverage of the Cubana flight, it is
very doubtful that the alleged activity involving the private twin-
engined aircraft and passenger would have gone unnoticed or unreported
had it occurred. Personnel in Mexico City at the time were aware of
these sources and probably knew the above facts, feeling no need to
follow further.

The report in question was in error, and misled the SSC in its
summary of the matter.

The Passenger on the 27 November 1963 Flight

At pages 61-63 and 104, the SSC Final Report describes in con-
siderable detail information concerning a Cuban-American who came to
the attention of the CIA and the FBI in the period following the
assassination of President Kennedy. The introductory comments of the
SSC Final Report state that:

+ One source alleged that the Cuban-American

was ‘involved' in the assassination."

CONFIDENTIAL

13


13-00000

CONFIDEN ifaL
The SSC Report states that the CIA reported the case to the FBI, “almost
immediately," but that the Bureau did not conduct a follow-up investi-
gation "as part of (its) work for the Warren Commission." Further
down the same page the SSC Report states that "(t)he FBI did investi-
gate this individual after receiving the CIA report of his unusual
travel." At page 63 the SSC Report observes that "...the suspicious
travel of this individual coupled with the possibility that Oswald had
contacted the Tampa chapter (of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee--FPCC)
certainly should have prompted a far more thorough and timely investi-
gation than the FBI conducted..." We do not know just what the Bureau
did in this respect, nor have we tried to resolve the apparent incon-
sistencies in the SSC Report noted above, but the SSC Final Report
contains considerable detail about the man, presumably reflecting the
results of FBI inquiries.
While this section of the SSC Report is directed primarily at the
FBI, we reviewed the reporting because of CIA's initial role in reporting:
about the man. There is also one implicit criticism of CIA, which will
be noted.
Book V of the SSC Final Report has the following summary statement

at page 104, in the chronology section: :

"December 5 - Mexico Station cables that someone who

saw the Cuban-American board the aircraft to Havana

on November 27 reported that he ‘looked suspicious'..."
At page 61 it states that there "is no indication that CIA followed-

up on this report (that the man was “involved in the assassination"),



13-00000

except to ask a Cuban defector about his knowledge of the Cubanr
American's activities."

The presentation of this matter in the SSC Report contains some
inaccuracies. First, the Mexico City Station did not cable Washington
that the man "looked suspicious." There was a cable, dated 5 December
1963, but it reported that the man had "crossed at Laredo, Texas on
23 November," that he registered at a certain hotel in Mexico City at
a certain time on 25 November, that he checked out of the hotel at a
certain time and departed for Havana “as only passenger on Cubana
flight on night 27 November," and that there was a good photograph of
him taken at the airport. This was followed by a dispatch the same
date, repeating the basic information in the cable, enclosing the photo-
graph, and containing the following cryptic statement:

“Source states the timing and circumstances surrounding

Subject's travel through Mexico and departure for Havana

are suspicious."
This comment is cryptic, at least, and--given that dramatic moment in
history--doubtless reflects a preliminary comment of a person who
was on the alert at that time for anything that might be construed as
possibly unusual. The above quotation was the Station's actual report
of the observation by the source, and is what was reported to the FBI;
it differs from the quotation in the SSC Report. There was an internal
memo in the Station that was even more cryptic, but which was in the

nature of an informal reminder, which stated that the man was reported



13-00000

to have "looked suspicious"; but this formulation never found its way
into the more careful statements that usually characterize official
reporting. The point is that the observation was cryptic and impres-
sionistic, rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic
activity or final conclusions.

There is one piece of reporting that could confuse those reviewing
the record, but which is essentially resolved when considered in the
context of known facts. On 19 March 1964, Monterrey Base cabled
that a source of a local (Monterrey) "agent of the federal judicial
police" had information on a man; the description seems to have the
same Cuban-American in mind. The following should be noted about the
report: it misspelled the man's name; it offered a bare statement
that he "was involved in Kennedy assassination"; it states that he
entered Mexico “on foot" from Laredo, Texas (according to the SSC Final
Report, the FBI concluded that he entered by automobile); it asserts
that he stayed at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City (while the dates and
times of his registration and check-out at a specific hotel in Mexico
City, where he stayed, were known); it gave an incorrect number for his
passport; and, it stated that his Mexican tourist card was issued
in Nuevo Laredo (when it was known to have been issued in Tampa,
Florida). The report, on its face, was factually incorrect on a number
of known points. The source patently was extensively misinformed, the
hard facts of his report being in error. The Chief of Base at the time,
when queried about the report in the course of the present review, could

not recall it.



13-00000

There is one additional aspect of the matter, in which the
record is confused. If we are to comment negatively on the pre-
sentation by the SSC in its emphasis on report, we must point out
that the Mexico City Station's response to the Monterrey report
contributes to such confusion as may exist on the matter. When
Mexico City received the Monterrey cable the Deputy Chief of
Station replied that the information in the report “jibes fully
with that provided Station by (Mexico City source) 4 December 63."
It did not jibe in most respects, other than the date and place of
entry into Mexico. The mistake of that cable cannot be explained
today, but wrong it obviously was. It does, however, serve to
highlight the basic unreliability of the report and indicate how
it should be considered responsibly.

Implicit criticism of CIA's not collecting more information
on the man is not well founded. It had no real sources with access
to information concerning him; when a defector from Cuba became
available with such information he was queried and the results

were provided the authorities.

CIA Operations Against Cuba *

The SSC Final Report speaks of operations against Cuba and the
Castro regime, and contends that they should have been reported in
detail to the Warren Commission as part of the subject matter that
it consciously took into consideration. A case can be made for
specific considerations of these various activities by the Warren
Commission, at least as part of the unique background of the times;
it might have provided it additional investigative leads. However,
to advance the general thought is not to discard the usual tests of
evidence that must still control how the findings are treated.

It should be noted that at the time of the Warren Commission
inquiry there was no secret about the tensions between the Kennedy
Administration and the Castro regime. Book V of the SSC Final
Report refers briefly to some of the more dramatic events, such as
the Bay of Pigs in April 1961 and the Missile Crisis in October 1962
(see pages 2, 3, 10 and 11). In fact, the totality of American
policy and practice must have appeared threatening to the Castro
regime, and most certainly must have been considered by it as pro-
vocative.

Additional U. S. policies and programs that could have been

viewed negatively by Castro were the breaking of diplomatic relations,

economic and political sanctions, paramilitary operations (which re-
ceived recurring publicity in the press), as well as a variety of
covert operations that were not known publicly. On 18 November 1963
President Kennedy -- four days before his death -- delivered a major
policy address in Miami, accusing Castro of having betrayed the Cuban
revolution; at the time the press, reportedly on the basis of what
“White House sources" said about it, viewed it as a call for the Cuban
people to overthrow the Castro regime.

The United States provided a haven and base for Cuban exiles, who
conducted ‘their independent operations against the Castro government.
Some of these exiles had the support of CIA, as well as from other
elements of the U.S. Government, and still others had support from
private sources. With or without official U.S. support these exiles
spoke in forceful Latin terms about what they hoped to do. The Cuban
intelligence services had agents in the exile community in America
and it is likely that what they reported. back to Havana assigned to
CIA responsibility for many of the activities under consideration,
whether CIA was involved or not.

We do not know the extent to which the Warren Commission took
what might be characterized as "judicial notice" of the tensions
between the two governments and their leaders; it certainly was in

the public domain. That consideration was given the possibility of

Cuban or Soviet involvement in the assassination is no secrets clearly,
reflecting a recognition of the question at the time. That a request
was not made by the Warren Commission, nor volunteered by the intel-
ligence agencies, for extensive review of all Cuban operations is being
faulted today. Yet, in the light of understandings at that time, it
could well have appeared to members of the Warren Commission and its
staff as not directly relevant, in fact, to the specific issue of the
murder of the President. In the absence of evidence to the contrary
a case could still be made for that view, although the evolution of
public perceptions probably would not accept it without reservation.

The. SSC Final Report has fixed on the Cuban operations of the
intelligence agencies--primarily those of CIA--for special attention
in considering the question. Implicitly it accepts the theory that
there could well have been conspiracy in the murder of President
Kennedy, and that Castro could have been behind it, having been pro-
voked by depredations against Cuba or plotting against his own life.
However, in advancing its thesis, the SSC Report cautioned that it
had "seen no evidence that Fidel Castro or others in the Cuban govern-
ment plotted President Kennedy's assassination in retaliation for U.S.
operations against Cuba."

In response to this perception, conveyed in Book V of the SSC

Final Report, we have conducted a major review of Agency files (the



13-00000

SECRET.

organization of that effort is discussed at Tab A of this report). This
was for the express purpose of identifying any separate activities that
could have provoked Castro to order the assassination of President
Kennedy had he learned of them, and to evaluate their security.

Today, in 1977, it is difficult to reconstruct exactly everything
that did and did not occur in the course of the Warren Commission in-
quiries in 1964. Not all that happened is a matter of record. For
instance, in CIA at that time there were many individuals assigned to
various aspects of Cuban operations. They were familiar in detail with
those activities, with what they were and with their strengths and
weaknesses. They doubtless made numerous conscious but unrecorded
judgments about what seemed relevant or irrelevant to the considera-
tions of the Warren Commission. Had they been aware of any aspects of
those activities that may have related to the assassination of the
President it is safe to say it would have been surfaced in some way.
While CIA produced considerable material for the investigation (see
Tab E) that more was not reported is a meaningful indication of what
was known then by those actually involved, as distinguished from what
might be hypothesized at a later date. To contend to the contrary --
which has been suggested by some -- would require a unanimous con-
spiracy of many American citizens, employees of CIA, many of whom

knew aspects.of even the most closely guarded activities.

Today, the knowledge of the persons involved directly in the
various Cuban operations in the period preceding President Kennedy's
death cannot be recaptured in the form that it existed then. Those
persons are scattered, their memories are blurred by time, and some
are dead. The SSC, for instance -- in its attempt to capture ele-
ments of the past -- seems to have léd some employees into expressing
opinions on subject matter they did not know in 1964, apparently in
response to representations by SSC staff members as to the facts; this
illustrates at best the difficulties in resolving hypothetical issues,
today, on.a responsible basis.

The SSC Final Report devotes considerable time to the so-called
AMLASH operation, which centered on a high Cuban official who was
dissatisfied with the Castro regime. The Agency had only a tentative
relationship with this man during President Kennedy's life, although
the SSC Final Report -- in trying to prove its thesis -- has attempted
to present it differently. Because the case is discussed so exten-
sively in the SSC Final Report, it is treated in a separate annex in
this paper, at Tab D. The key point is that prior to President
Kennedy's death the relationship with AMLASH/1 was amorphous and
without substance. Had Castro learned of it he could learn only that
there was a contact that had not developed to the point of an under-
taking. This will not be treated further in this section of this

discussion.

In the face of the hypotheses advanced by the SSC Final Report,
it has been felt necessary to review in depth all records of Cuban
operations conducted by CIA during the period in question, 1961-1964.
The organization of the review is described at Tab A. It was not
possible to predict the form that information turned up by this
inquiry might take, and special care had to be exercised in the effort.
In doing this the "provocation concept" of the SSC Report was kept in
mind. In the months that it took to complete this extensive review,
it is significant to observe that three areas of specific operational
activity were found that either might meet some of the requirements
of the provocation theory, or throw some further light on issues
already considered. To report this conclusion is not to dismiss the
original questions that faced the Warren Commission as to whether
there might have been Cuban or Soviet connections with Oswald. That
such possibilities remain unresolved in some minds is apparent, but
that the records of CIA, in such a review, do not add significantly
to evidence on the subject, is the conclusion of the present inquiry.

The areas of operational activity noted above can be described
briefly as follows:

1. Operations directed against the Cuban leadership (AMTRUNK) .
2. Operations involving the criminal underworld.

3. Other reports of plans to assassinate Castro.

Operation AMTRUNK

*

There is one other general activity that was considered in the
course of the present research, which is discussed below. This
activity, AMTRUNK, was to develop a capability for splitting the
leadership of the Castro regime and eventually overthrowing it. It
never reached the point of implementation; however, because it suffered
possible security vulnerabilities, it is treated here even though it
never materialized. In our professional judgment this activity,
because of its failure to ever develop substance, is not really rele-
vant to the question. It is included simply because it might be viewed,
by virtue of its security vulnerabilities, as fitting in part the
hypothesis of the SSC Final Report; it seemed better to include it than
try and explain at some later date why it was omitted, although the
reasoning should be apparent. If its inclusion in this report is subject
to question because of its lack of substance, perhaps it serves some
purpose in indicating how little turned up in the course of this
research to meet any of the rather loosely formulated provocation thesis
of the SSC Report.

In early 1963 there were Cuban exiles who wished to change the
direction that events seemed to have taken in Cuba. Two of them, Nestor
Antonio Moreno Lopez and Enrique Cayardo Robera, developed an oper-
ational concept to overthrow the Castro government, which came to be
known as the Leonardo Plan. Cayardo had been a public figure in Cuba,
who had no apparent role in the activity following original inception
of the plan. Moreno was the son of a Cuban senator and Minister of Public
Works; as a lawyer in Cuba he had been involved in only a minor way in

the anti-Batista movement.



13-00000

Moreno defected to the United States in April 1961, settling
in Miami where he associated with anti-Castro exiles. Among his
associates was Jorge Ajbuszy Volsky, a Cuban citizen of Polish origin.
Volsky had been in prison in the USSR in the 1940's, and enlisted in
the Polish Air Force during WWII under the British Air Command. After
WWIT he married a Cuban national, and for a period operated his own
business in Havana.. Although avidly pro-Castro he reportedly was
imprisoned for a few weeks following the Bay of Pigs invasion. As
he held a valid U.S. visa, he left Cuba, arriving in Miami in May 1961.

Cayardo and Moreno discussed the Leonardo Plan with Volsky. He,
in turn, discussed it with Tadeus (Tad) Witold Szulc, a reporter with
the New York Times. Szulc had reported on Cuban activities for the
New York Times prior to the fall of Batista, during which time he had
developed a wide acquaintance among Cubans. He was transferred to
the Times Washington Bureau in April 1961, where he claimed to have
an entree to the White House through his uncle, Ambassador John C.
Wiley. He also claimed to have a standing invitation for direct con-
tact with President Kennedy, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and
McGeorge Bundy on matters concerning Cuba. While the actual nature of
this entree is not known to CIA, it is through his intercession that
the Leonardo Plan gained government-level support and approval.

In early 1963 Szulc arranged an interview in Washington with
Mr. Richard Goodwin, a White House advisor. Volsky and Szulc then met
with Robert Hurwitch, a senior official in the Department of State,
who presented the concept to the CIA with Department approval. CIA

assigned it to its Miami Station, where it became known as AMTRUNK.



13-00000

SECRET

*

AMTRUNK was conceived as first identifying disaffected key per-
sonnel in the Cuban armed forces with the long range objective of
uniting them against the Castro regime. On 4 April 1963 CIA cabled
certain stations and bases orders to identify Cubans who might be
used in the activity. During that period the CIA Chief of Station
in Miami questioned CIA control of the operation. Noting uncertain
security considerations, he felt it best to fund the operation gen-
erously in order for it to proceed independently.

On 17 April 1963 Szulc informed Hurwitch that the Miamt Station
had given Volsky responsibility for the decision of whether or not
the operation was to proceed; this was not consistent with CIA
intentions,

In August 1963 things still had not progressed very far. A
Headquarters cable on 5 August 1963 to certain stations and bases
complained about the absence of responses to the 4 April cable. It
emphasized that activity to penetrate the Cuba armed forces was a
high priority objective. In early September 1963 AMTRUNK had three
intelligence sources in Cuba: Miguel A. Diaz Isalgue, Ramon Guin
Hector Robello, and Modesto Orozco Basulto, One of these sources,
Guin, .was reportedly close to AMLASH/1, a man with whom CIA was

dealing separately through a Headquarters case officer -- but at

that time unsuccessfully -- in trying to develop an operational ap-
proach similar in some respects to AMTRUNK. The AMLASH operation is
discussed at Tab D. i

It was decided at the end of October 1963 that Moreno should be
separated from the operational details of the AMTRUNK operation be-
cause of numerous indiscretions and poor security practice. Arrange-
ments were made to involve him in a radio program to be used in con-
nection with the Rebel Army that eventually it was hoped would arise
against Castro. Moreno threatened to appeal this decision through
Volsky and Szulc to the President.

In November 1963 the program was still trying to develop leads
into higher echelons of the military and civilian leadership. The
operation moved slowly, with preliminary infiltrations designed to
set up infiltration/exfiltration routes. Although it had success-
fully recruited some persons during 1963 in Cuba, it had made prac-
tically no progress in establishing an organization or any capability
for action. At a much later date as its numbers increased its secur-
ity became less certain. In 1965 its security was believed to have
been seriously compromised and the decision was taken to'cut off re-
lations with it, Various figures were arrested, including Guin, Diaz

and AMLASH/1.

The reason for selecting this operation for discussion here is
just not its denouement in 1965, but possible security weaknesses
from the beginning. Szulc and Volsky are considered to be highly
suspect and they are discussed below, with another person who became
involved in the activity.

a. Tad Szulc. Szulc has been suspect since 1948 when
the FBI recorded reports that he was a communist. Re-
portedly he was in frequent contact with communist party
leaders and functionaries throughout Latin America. Sus-_
picions about his motives or possible connections with
foreign intelligence services, have never been proven.

Nicole Szulc, daughter of Tad Szulc, is reportedly an avid

communist. Philip Agee's Inside the Company: A CIA Diary

credits Nicole Szulc with having "obtained vital research
materials in New York and Washington, D.C." She is be-
lieved to be an agent of the Cuban DGI. Doubts about Tad
Szulc are unconfirmed but remain alive. Of Polish origin
Szulc became a U.S. citizen in 1954 by a special bill of
Congress.

b. Jorge Ajbuszyc Volsky. Like Szulc, he is of Polish

origin. He and Szulc became acquainted in 1959-1960 in

Cuba. A CI Study of Volsky, dated 24 August 1964, prepared
by a JMWAVE analyst, makes the following statement: "Volsky's
knowledge of clandestine methods of operation, together with
his Russian prison background and his ingenuity as a middleman
in U.S. Government/CIA activities, made him an excellent
candidate for a communist penetration agent and that the pos-
sibility existed that he might be a singleton, sleeper or
stringer for the RIS." There has been no confirmation of
these suspicions. Volsky became a naturalized U.S. citizen
on 10 April 1969.

c. Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez. Born in Cuba, he was the
son of a native born American citizen. He was educated both
in Cuba and in the States and later (1940) enlisted in the
U.S. Army. After discharge he returned to Cuba but kept
moving back and forth between the U.S. and Cuba. Viewed in
retrospect, his career presents a patter of changing alle-
giances. He enjoined the anti-Batista forces in March 1952
first with the Cuban exiles in the United States and later
from inside Cuba. He joined the Cuban Army under Batista
and was the Cuban liaison officer with the U.S. Army mis-

sion in Cuba from November 1954 until 1956. During his

2

SECRET


13-00000

entire period in the Cuban Army, he was involved with
dissident army elements. RABEL was arrested in April 1956 when
he participated in an attempted coup. After a short imprison-
ment he returned to the U.S. and worked with one of his brothers.
In October 1957, he returned to Cuba and became involved with
the 26th of July Movement and later with the Cienfuegos Group.
Shortly after the Castro victory, Castro called upon RABEL to
set up a Cuban Marine Corps, a job he held until 1960, at which
time he was appointed Chief of Viviendos Campesinas (Rural
Housing). Approached by CIA, he refused to work ‘in place but
was willing to defect, which he did in December 1962, being
recruited by JMWAVE Station where he was used in AMTRUNK
activities. He returned to Cuba on his own in 1965, reportedly
to attempt the exfiltration of his family. Upon return to Cuba
he was arrested and sentenced to 30 years imprisonment but was
set free in July or August 1967. There were accusations that
RABEL was a Cuban agent as early as July 1963. The accusations
were never proven.

In view of the later roll-up of the AMTRUNK operation the

tentative opinion has been offered that the operation could have
been an ingenious plan by the Cubans from the beginning, using access

at high levels in the U.S. Government to learn the identities of



13-00000

individuals in the Cuban hierarchy who were disloyal to the regime.
Whatever the later penetrations by Cuban intelligence, the role of
Szulc and Volsky, in the early phase of the operation, could have
exposed both its members and eventual objectives to Cuban intelli-
gence.

Accepting the possibility of vital security flaws in the
operation, it must be observed that there was very little progress
and no concrete planning during the life of President Kennedy. The
eventual objective was to develop sufficient support and organization
to overthrow the Cuban regime. It never made much progress,
although it did lay down caches and conducted some infiltrations
and exfiltrations in 1964 and 1965.

An attempt to build support that might eventually have the
capability to attempt a coup against the Castro regime obviously
would have been irritating to Castro. That it never really prog-
ressed very far during the life of President Kennedy is a relevant
consideration to whether or not the tentative beginnings would have
provoked Castro to order the assassination of President Kennedy.

New Considerations on the Syndicate Operation

In the course of the present review a by-line story by Paul

Meskil in the New York Daily News attracted special attention because



13-00000

aT

*

of one statement that it contained. One of a series of stories
printed 20-25 April 1975, it quoted Frank Sturgis as follows:

"The third (assassination) scheme involved

Planting a bomb in Castro's office. 'I had

access to the Prime Minister's office,’ Sturgis

said. ‘I knew Fidel's private secretary Juan

Orta. I recruited him to work with the embassy

(American Embassy in Havana).'"

Sturgis has been something of a soldier of fortune over the
years, having served in different branches of the U.S. military
and having been in the anti-Batista movement prior to Castro's
takeover. Sturgis stayed on in Cuba until mid-1959, during which
time he reportedly had some role in the Castro regime's control
of the gambling interests. He came to the United States in 1959.
Sturgis gained notoriety when arrested on 17 June 1972 in the Water-
gate break-in. He has claimed on a number of occasions to have been
an employee of CIA, although there is no record of any such relation-
ship. He was in contact with some of the CIA Cuban employees in the
Miami area, but had no direct relationships with the Agency.
The particular feature in the above excerpt from the newspaper

story is that it constitutes the first public reference to Juan

Orta in the role of an assassin in plans against Castro. Orta was,

15

Cm



13-00000

SECRET,

in fact, the first man who reportedly was to have been used in the
operation that CIA had, with the criminal syndicate, to kill Castro.
Orta was the director of the Office of the Prime Minister, which
gave him the access that would make it possible for him to poison
Castro. The plan failed because Orta lost his position, and with
it his access, in late January 1961. This was prior to delivery
of the poison pills to him in late February or early March 1961.
Orta's role in this connection was over when he took refuge in the
Venezuelan Embassy in Havana in April 1961. He was allowed to leave
Cuba in October 1964 and settled in Miami in February 1965. As for
Sturgis’ assertion that he recruited Orta to work with the embassy,
CIA files have no record that Orta was recruited for CIA by anyone
during the period there was an embassy in Cuba. While Orta was
reported in early 1961 as being used in the CIA-syndicate attempt
against Castro, CIA had no direct relationships with him until he
left Cuba, at which time he was used as a source of information on
the Cuban leadership.

The fact remains that Orta did at one time have the role of
intended assassin. Sturgis' identification of Orta in this capacity,
prior to its becoming known to external investigators in 1975, raised

the question of just what Sturgis had known, and whether he could

SEDRET)
1

6


13-00000

have been a source of information on the subject whereby Castro
could have learned of CIA's earlier plan against his life.

Newspaper stories are not necessarily reliable sources of
information. However, because the statement by Sturgis in 1975
indicated a familiarity with Orta's availability to play the role
of assassin in 1960, additional attention was given the statement
jin the press to see how it might fit in with other things that are
known. What follows is subject to reservations that must attach
to the reliability of newspaper stories. zi

The New York Daily News stories (20-25 April 1975), and another
story by the same author on 13 June 1976, refer to possible relation-
ships between Sturgis and Trafficante, also mentioning a Norman
Rothman as a gambling partner of Trafficante. The Office of Security
wrote a memorandum in 1975, in conjunction with the first set of New
York Daily News stories, noting that there was a connection between
Sturgis and Rothman in 1960, citing FBI reports. It is pertinent
to note here that in addition to the role Sturgis is reported to
have had with the Castro government in relation to the gambling
activities, Juan Orta's availability for the assassination assignment
was understood to be due to his having lost payoffs that he had once
received from the gambling interests. One can deduce that Sturgis

and Orta could have known one another because of their connections



13-00000

with the gambling activities as well as having contacts with
the men heading the gambling organizations.

The New York Daily News story of 1976 also reports a claim by a
Marie Lorenz that she acted in 1960 in behalf of Sturgis, in an
attempt to assassinate Castro. She had also been mentioned in the
1975 stories. Ms. Lorenz reportedly was Castro's mistress at one
Point, and her access, so the story indicates, was used as a means
for getting to him. The 1976 news story concludes that "soon after
her murder mission failed the CIA recruited Mafia mobsters a . to
kill Castro . . ." In the news story she claimed that the plan
involved the use of poison pills which she concealed in a jar of face
cream; they dissolved and could not be used.

On page 79 of the SSC Interim Report on Alleged Assassination
Plots the following is extracted from an 18 October 1960 memorandum
from the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the CIA
Deputy Director for Plans:

“During recent conversations with several
friends, (Sam) Giancana stated that Fidel
Castro was to be done away with very shortly.
When doubt was expressed regarding this state-
ment, Giancana reportedly assured those
present that Castro's assassination would occur
in November. Moreover, he allegedly indicated

that he had already met with the assassin-to-be



13-00000

SECRET

on three occasions . . . Giancana claimed that *
everything has been perfected for the killing

of Castro, and that the ‘assassin’ had arranged
with a girl, not further described, to drop a 'pill'
in some drink or food of Castro."

This seems to confirm some plot involving a woman to kill Castro
with poison. However, the dating of events does not fit the time
frame known to CIA. While consideration had been given to various
schemes, there were no CIA pills for delivery until February .1961.

It suggests that the syndicate may have been moving ahead on its own.

Following collapse of CIA's access to Castro through Orta,
Johnny Roselli, the man who had served as the Agency's original inter-
mediary with the syndicate, stated that he knew a Cuban exile leader
who might participate. This man, Tony Varona, headed the Democratic
Revolutionary Front, one of the exile groups that also received
support from CIA as part of the larger Cuban operation. Varona was
dissatisfied with the nature and extent of that support; Miami Station
suspected that he was not keeping his bargain with the Agency. In
fact, it is possible that Varona already was involved in independent
operations with the criminal syndicate when first approached prior to
the Bay of Pigs in March 1961 to carry out the Castro assassination.
The 1967 IG Report refers to two FBI reports that bear on this.

One of them, on 21 December 1960, indicates support by the criminal

SECRET

19


13-00000

”

underworld for some of the Cuban exiles. The other report, on

18 January 1961, suggests that Varona was one of those receiving

that support, although this was not confirmed. As a matter of
interest, as late as 10 June 1964 there was a report that gangster
elements in the Miami area were offering $150,000 for anyone who
would kill Castro (an amount mentioned to the syndicate repre-
sentatives by CIA case officers at an earlier date). These bits

of information, fitted together, could provide the basis for an
explanation of why Varona was so readily available when approached

by Roselli. It also may throw light on a question noted in the

1967 IG Report. The operation with the syndicate had been called

off following the Bay of Pigs in April 1961; yet, when it was
reactivated in April 1962 the case officer felt there was something
already ongoing in spite of the fact that the operation had been
terminated a year earlier. It is possible that CIA simply found itself -
involved in providing additional resources for independent operations
that the syndicate already had under way. The criminal syndicate

had important interests in Cuba, and to recover them may well have
sought on its own to eliminate Castro. In a sense CIA may have been
piggy-backing on the syndicate and in addition to its material contri-

butions was also supplying an aura of official sanction.



13-00000

SECRET

What do these various considerations suggest? It is obviols
that many lines of speculation can be developed, not the least of
which is that the Agency did not know the full extent of syndicate
activities. Clearly, the Agency's case officers felt that they were
initiating a new activity that had the sole purpose of accomplishing
the elimination of Castro. The additional considerations can be
listed as follows:

1. The criminal syndicate may well have had some inde-
pendent activities of its own underway prior to CIA involve-
ment in late 1960. These operations could well have con-
tinued after the CIA standdown following the Bay of Pigs,
being ongoing in some form when CIA reactivated the plan
in April 1962.

b. The syndicate operations could have activities such
as those that are reported in the New York Daily News
stories in 1975 and 1976.

3. Frank Sturgis seems to have had contacts with the
criminal syndicate, although from outward appearances he
was not a member of it. He could well have been used by
the syndicate in its activities.

4. Sturgis has not been a reliable source, so his
statements are treated with considerable reserve. He
probably did know Juan Orta when both of them were in Cuba.

He was outside of Cuba, however, when Orta was given the

SECRET

21


13-00000

‘SEGRET

role of assassin. Whatever he knew at that time--and

his knowledge may be of a much later date--could have..been

in the form reported fifteen years later in the 1975 -

newspaper stories. If there was such an operation it

was not CIA's; it could have been an earlier operation

of the syndicate. While Sturgis could have known of

or have been involved in earlier activity by the syndicate,

whatever its form, he may also have had no part in any

of it; he may merely have fabricated a story from bits -

and pieces learned by him from gossip in the Miami

community after Orta settled there in 1965.

5. If the syndicate was conducting its own operations,

that would tend to reinforce the thought that the details

of its operations would have been characterized by discre-

tion--or security--despite the FBI report in October 1960.

The authors of Book V of the SSC Final Report felt that the

we operation seeking to employ the resources of the criminal syndicate

would not have provided Castro the clear provocation that was hypothe-
sized for the AMLASH operation. At page 68 the Report stated:

" . . . it is unlikely that Castro could have

(SECRET
22


13-00000

distinguished the CIA plots with the underworld

from those plots not backed by CIA. In fact,

the methods the CIA used in these attempts were

designed to prevent the Cuban government from

attributing them to the CIA."
In a sense the SSC made a conscious judgment, in the context of its
Provocation theory, that was made less consciously and in a different
context in 1964 by the few CIA enployees who knew of the operations
with the syndicate -- that they bore no relation to the assassination
of President Kennedy.

Possible Ruby--Trafficante Contact

There are fragments of unevaluated reports that leave one aspect
of the involvement of the criminal syndicate as a question. This can
only be noted here, as the means for resolving it one way or another

are not within the Agency's capabilities.

As noted earlier (see _page 4), a 27 November 1963

report records statements by a British journalist that during his own
imprisonment in Cuba in 1959 he knew of a gangster type named “Santos"
who was in jail where he was visited by another American gangster type
named "Ruby." Current speculation has considered the possibility that
"Santos" was Santos Trafficante who may have been in jail there in
1959. An FBI report of 14 August 1964 recorded a statement by a person

jailed in Cuba that he shared a cell with Trafficante.



13-00000

SEGRET

If the "Santos" in the British report was Trafficante, the
British and FBI reports tend to support one another on the narrow
point of his imprisonment in Cuba in 1959. This is a material
consideration, as there are reservations about both sources.

It may be that the FBI has more information on this point, but
there is no further known relevant information in the Agency
on the matter.

The significance of this is that if Trafficante was in
jail in Cuba in 1959, he could have been available for a visit
by Jack Ruby if such visits were allowed. Ruby, in fact, did visit
Cuba in 1959. The long time gap between 1959 and November 1963
removes the two incidents from candidacy for consideration as
evidence of conspiracy against President Kennedy. However, if
Ruby was running an errand for someone in 1959, it would provide
an interesting lead for those inquiring into the possible signi-
ficance of past assocations or contacts.

Both the British report and the confirmation of Ruby's
1959 visit were known to the Warren Commission, and Ruby

reportedly spoke at length about his visit when questioned.

However, Ruby is dead and Trafficante has declined to testify *
at all. A later allegation of a visit by Ruby to Cuba in late
1962 or early 1963 is believed not to be true.

Other Reported Assassination Proposals

There were other references to possible assassination plots
against Castro that seem not to have been addressed in the Interim

Report of the SSC on Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign

Leaders. They are summarized briefly below:

In May 1975 a Cuban exile who came to be a contract employee
stated that in February 1961 he was given a rifle and the mission
to enter Cuba to assassinate Castro. He claimed to have tried to
enter Cuba three times, but failed each time in gaining entry to
Cuba. Agency files have no further records on this matter.

As a result of a column by Jack Anderson in May 1977, a check
was made of Agency files referring to an Antonio Veciana, cited
by Anderson as a CIA employee. The man was never an employee of the
Agency, but he was connected with ALPHA-66, a Cuban exile movement.
On three separate occasions (December 1960, July 1962, April 1966)
he proposed to CIA employees the assassination of Fidel Castro.
He was rebuffed on each occasion. Again in 1970 there was a report
of his making a similar proposal while an AID employee at an overseas
post. The details of his actual role is unknown to the Agency,

although the FBI may have more details on him. This is touched on in

Tab G, which comments on selected newspaper stories published in the

course of this research effort.

Agent Messages in 1961 Mentioning Plans to Kill Castro

1. During the investigations in 1975 five agent messages were
identified that made reference to plans to kill Castro, or proposing
such action. Three of these messages related to the same operation,
the other two relating to separate proposals; there is no indication
that any of these proposals was the result of CIA initiative. The
existence of these messages was mentioned during Mr. Colby's testimony
before the Church Committee. In response to a request from the Deputy
Inspector General, LA Division prepared a summary of the messages
and on 8 August 1975 forwarded it to the Review Staff, then charged
with serving as an interface with the congressional committees.
Records of the Review Staff do not show how this paper was handled.
The subject was not covered in the Church Committee's interim report
on Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders and is
summarized again below.

I

2. Three of the messages involved the same group of agents,
and seem to relate to the same plan. The first message, dated
27 March 1961 (prior to the Bay of Pigs) was sent by an Agency
asset, AMBRONC/5. The message requested the Agency's opinion on
a proposed sabotage of the electric company in Havana, stating that
this could be coordinated "with attempt against Fidel in public

appearance (at) Sports Palace." The cable expressed the view that

26
SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

an “attempt against.Fidel (is) in accordance with general plan."
There is no record that this message was answered. Two days later,
on 29 March 1961, possibly because of the absence of a reply, the
same agent sent another message. This stated that the plan was
scheduled for 9 April. Castro was to speak at the Palace, and an
"assassination attempt at said place (will be) followed by a general
shutting off of main electric plants in Havana." General anti-regime
developments to follow this were then outlined. This message was
answered on 30 March agreeing that a "major effort should be launched
Havana on date you selected." It recommended contacting other named
persons, looking to a more general uprising. The message addressed
the general issue, making no comment on the proposal to kill Castro.
A third message, on 5 April 1961, presumably from the same agent,
reported that the persons he had been directed to contact had arms
for only 50 men. While stating that the sabotage of the electric
company and "possibly attempt on Fidel" would be carried out 9 April,
he emphasized that to do so would make it impossible to maintain a
clandestine organization in Cuba; “your military aid is decisive. If it
does not come that date we are lost." There is no indication that
this message was answered. No further reference to this plan has
been found.

3. We have reviewed the files of the persons identified in the
cables, and have interviewed a case officer who was responsible for
one of them, in an attempt to learn more about the matter. The

four agents in question are commented on briefly below:

27
SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

a. AMBRONC/5 is the agent who sent the messages out-
lining the proposed sabotage effort and attempt against
Castro.

(1) 201 file opened 15 July 1960. A POA was
not issued until 18 December 1961, and an OA on
31 January 1962. A debriefing of him in November
1960, prior to the Kennedy Administration, revealed
that he had been in touch with people who had
plotted the assassination of Fidel Castro, and claimed
to have tried himself to make similar plans. He was
infiltrated on 9 December 1960, exfiltrating 15 February
1961.

(2) AMBRONC/5 was infiltrated again 3 March
1961 and exfiltrated again 19 June 1961. This
covered the period of his messages and the Bay of
Pigs. His sole mission was to organize resistance
groups.

(3) AMBRONC/5 was infiltrated again on 19 December
1961, exfiltrating 29 March 1962, again with the same
mission.

(4) AMBRONC/5 was infiltrated finally 2 May
1962, was arrested 29 May 1962, and was executed
30 August 1962. He has been reported as never admitting

that he was a CIA agent. His name is not one of those

in the book given Senator, McGovern by Castro, listing
those claimed by Castro to have plotted attempts against
his life.

b. AMCOAX/1 was one of those AMBRONC/5 was told to

contact for his general plan for April 1961.

(1) POA on 5 January 1961. His mission was to
organize paramilitary activities in Cuba. He in-
filtrated in February 1961 and exfiltrated in July
1961 following the Bay of Pigs. This period covered
the above messages.

(2) Re-infiltrated 29 July 1961, with the same
organizing mission, he was arrested on 17 August 1961,
and is serving a thirty year term. His name appears
in the book given Senator McGovern.

c. AMPUG/1 was another of those AMBRONC/5 was told to

contact for his general plan in April 1961.

(1) Recruited in September 1960, he was in-
filtrated that month, receiving airdrops in December
1960. He returned to the U.S. 15 May 1961, following
the Bay of Pigs.

(2) Infiltrated again on 29 June 1961, with the
mission to organize resistance groups and conduct
sabotage operations, he was arrested in July 1961, and
is serving a thirty year term. His name is among those

in the bock given Senator McGovern by Castro.

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

d. AMPANIC/7 was another of those that AMBRONC/5 was
told to contact for his general plan in April 1961.
(1) This man was a "walk-in" 15 April 1960,
a POA being issued 30 January 1961 (although there was
a MOC since 12 July 1960). He was to organize resistance
groups in the Havana and Pinar del Rio areas.
(2) Infiltrated 3 March 1961, he was arrested
23 April 1961, and is serving a thirty year term. His
name is among those in the book given Senator McGovern
by Castro. i
(3) Records relating to this man mention his in-
filtration into Cuba in August 1960 and exfiltration
in November 1960 (prior to his being issued a POA).
His “mission" during that period is mentioned tersely
as being “to organize resistance groups . . . for
mounting sabotage operations . . . and assassination
of prominent Cuban Communist members in the Castro
entourage . . ." The records refer to “his own
personal objectives" during this period and criticizes
: how he functioned during his stay in Cuba from August
to November 1960. The record then specifies how he is
to conduct himself and focus his efforts on his return,
which was to develop sabotage operations. We were able

to contact one of his two case officers, who has retired

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

(the other had died), to ascertain his recollections;
Stating that at the time the focus was on developing
organizations for operations, he stated that an
assassination mission, such as attributed to ANPANIC/7
on his earlier time in Cuba, not only was not authorized,
but would have compromised the effort to organize.
Any such assassination mission, the case officer states,
would have been at AMPANIC/7's own initiative.

4. It is clear that AMBRONC/5 envisioned a general uprising

in Cuba, to commence with sabotage of the electric plant in Havana

and an attempt on Castro's life. The third of his messages reflected

pessimism, and the fact is that the operation did not come off.
While the man had no express mission from the Agency to mount an
operation against Castro personally, it is clear that no specific
objection was recorded to his statement of intentions. The one
recorded reply addresses the concept of general action and makes
no reference to the proposal to make an attempt on Castro.

5. The fact is that. the 9 April 1961 operation did not come
off, and AMBRONC/5 has not been identified as an Agency asset.
Nor was his name included in the book given Senator McGovern
by Castro. The other men,. none of whom had a mission of assassi-
nation from the Agency, are now serving thirty year terms. That
their names were included in the list given Senator McGovern by

Castro may be an attempt on Castro's part to enlarge on the facts

31
SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

rather than to report what he truly believes. They were not
executed, a consideration that may support this view. t

6. The records are incomplete on the events identified by
the three messages. The time in question predates the Bay of Pigs.
The men mentioned above had more specific missions, other than
that of assassination. They exfiltrated subsequent to the event
described in the messages, and were arrested during subsequent
infiltrations into Cuba. There-is no record that any of them had
a mission from CIA to kill Castro. The person who proposed the
act in 1961 -- AMBRONC/5 -- never acknowledged that he was @ CIA
agent, and is not listed among those Castro reportedly believes
had the mission of his assassination.

Il

7. Another agent message dated 4 June 196] asked about a
man who had identified himself as Moratori of the Italian Embassy,
who claimed to work for U.S. intelligence and to be in touch with
one Martin Elena and others (none identifiable), who "have plans
for an invasion within 30 days, after the killing of Fidel." A
reply, dated 6 June, stated that the information was untrue and
that Moratori was not known and should not be trusted. (Insofar
as CIA records show, there was an Italian diplomat of that name
in Cuba at that time. Little is known about him.) The originator

of the agent message cannot be identified from present records.

8. Another agent message dated 3 May 1961 from a member of
the Revolutionary Recovery Movement in Cuba said “will try to kill
Fidel today." A reply to this message dated 4 May told the agent
and his companions to “lay low" for the time being, and "will
advise when operations can resume." There were no follow-up
messages on this subject in the records. The agent who sent the
message possibly was AMPUG/1, but as noted earlier his mission did

not include instructions to kill Fidel. His companions have not

been identified.

AMLASH OPERATION

1.__AMLASH OPERATION .

Comment on the AMLASH operation, in the context of its presenta-
tion in Book V of the Final Report of the SSC, is complicated by the
treatment given it in the Report. Rather than being treated ina
unified way, reference and discussion is found throughout the Report.”

The actual nature and the significance of the AMLASH operation
differs materially from that presented in the SSC Report. The Report
leaves the inference that AMLASH/1 was perhaps an agent of Castro, with
the mission of provoking a plot against Castro (pages 3, 74 and 79),
which in turn provided Castro with the justification for launching
Lee Harvey Oswald against President Kennedy in retaliation. Alternatively,
the Report suggests that AMLASH/1 was so insecure in the conduct of his
activities that the details of his plotting could have become known to
Castro, thereby providing the same basic motivation (pages 74 and 75).
Whichever of these alternatives, so the reasoning would be, the AMLASH
operation should have been reported to the Warren Commission. We believe
that neither thesis applies. The character of the relationship between
CIA and AMLASH/1, prior to Oswald's assassination of President Kennedy,

was so insubstantial and inconclusive that it provided no basis for

AMLASH/J to feel that he had any tangible CIA support for plotting
against Castro. Whether one is inclined to see AMLASH/1 as either a
double agent or provocateur, or simply as a man who carelessly revealed
what he was doing, there was little for him to report or to leak.
RRR KR KR KR KKK

In preparing the current comment on the AMLASH operation, as
treated in the SSC Report, it was judged best to approach it in two
ways. A sequential summary of the AMLASH operation is intended to
present the Agency's understanding of the true nature of the activity.
Following that, selected points made in the SSC Report are addressed.
It is hoped that this presentation will help establish a clearer per-
spective for judging the actual substance of the operation.

RRR KAR KAR KR KR

As early as March 1959,. AMLASH/1 was reported as expressing
directly to Castro his dissatisfaction with the situation in Cuba.

At that time he also was reported as expressing his disillusionment
and that if he "...did not get out of the country soon, he would kill
Castro himself."

Two years later, in March 1961, AMLASH/1 was met in Mexico City
by a CIA case officer stationed there. The occasion was AMLASH/1's
presence at the leftist-sponsored Latin America Conference on National
Sovereignty, Emancipation, and Peace. The meeting was arranged by
AMWHIP/1, a long-time friend of AMLASH/1. A dispatch in July 1961,

giving a general round-up on operational activity against Cubans in



13-00000

Mexico City, described the meeting (along with others) as follows:

"...the Station made an unsuccessful ‘approach'

to (AMLASH/1)...the 'approach' consisted of a

"friendly' talk between a case officer, a mutual

friend of (AMLASH/1) and (AMLASH/1) when he last

was visiting in Mexico. While (AMLASH/1) did not

pick up the opportunity at that time, he apparently

did not report the incident to his superiors and

the ground work may have been laid for a similar action

in the future." =
Later in March there was a report that AMLASH/1T and another Cuban wanted
to defect and needed help in escaping. Consideration of their exfil-
tration ended with a report that the Cuban police were aware of AMLASH/1's
intention and plans.

In August 1961 AMWHIP/1 reported plans by AMLASH/1 to attend the
French National Student Union Cultural Festival, and that AMLASH/1
wanted to meet with a "friend" of the Mexico City case officer's. The
files do not reveal that such a contact actually occurred.

In June 1962 there was a report that AMLASH/1 would be travelling
via Prague to the World Youth Festival in Helsinki. AMLASH/1 was
reported as wanting to defect, and also that on his return from Helsinki
he would pass through Paris where he hoped to meet AMWHIP/1. The FBI,
which was aware of CIA's association with AMWHIP/1, met with AMWHIP/1
in Miami and took steps for him to be referred to CIA if he should

contact the Paris Legal Attache.

SECRET


13-00000

In July 1962 CIA contacted AMWHIP/1, who made known his dis-
satisfaction with the way CIA handled AMLASH/1's "planned defection" in
Paris in August 1961. Plans were made for a CIA case officer and
AMWHIP/1 to travel to Helsinki and anywhere else necessary. in an attempt
to bring about AMLASH/1's defection.

The first of a series of meetings with AMLASH/1 was held in
Helsinki on 1 August 1962. The original objective of his defection
became one of recruiting him in place. AMLASH/1 was reported as feeling
that if he could "do something really significant for the creation of a
new Cuba, he was interested in returning to carry on the Fight there."
AMLASH/1 spoke of sabotage of an oil refinery and the execution of a
top ranking Castro subordinate, of the Soviet Ambassador and of Castro
himself. The case officer's report stated:

"Uhile we were making no commitments or plans,

we pointed out to [AMLASH/1] that schemes like
he envisioned certainly had their place, but that
a lot of coordination, planning, information-
collection, etc., were necessary prerequisites to
ensure the value and success of such plans."
(Emphasis in original).

The security hazard of too frequent meetings in Helsinki led to
further meetings in Stockholm and Copenhagen. AMLASH/1 was next
met on 16 and 17 August in Paris where AMWHIP/1 and the case officer
were joined by another case officer. AMLASH/1 was given SW training

and supplies. On 20 August he was taken to the south of France for

4

a demolition demonstration. He refused to be polygraphed. The case
officer reported on 17 August:
"Have no intention give [AMLASH/1] physical
elimination mission as requirement but recognize
this something he could or might try to carry
out on his own initiative."
The Headquarters cabled reply the next day stated:
"Strongly concur that no physical elimination
missions be given [AMLASH/1]." -
On 29 August 1962 AMLASH/1 left Prague by air for Havana. This was
the last time that he was met until he next left Cuba in September
1963.
COMMENT :

It is noted at this point that AMLASH/1 was not a
recruited agent at that time--nor was he ever for that
matter, as Operational Approval was never granted for
this purpose. By the end of August 1962 the CIA rela-
tionship with AMLASH/1 had made no real progress,
although he was viewed as an operational contact with
potential. Over a year passed between August 1962 and
September 1963 when he was next contacted by CIA.

In terms of the relationship that he had with CIA the
critical period, for purposes of this paper, is there-

fore between 5 September and 22 November 1963.

AMLASH/1 attended the Collegiate Games in Porto Alegre, Brazil

from 5 through 8 September 1963, as a representative of the Cuban

Cia



13-00000

Government. He was met there by AMWHIP/1, and by the CIA case
officer who was to take over the relationship with him. AMLASH/1
said that he had written two SW messages (only one had been received).
He expressed his reluctance to use this form of communications because
of Cuban postal censorship.

It is pertinent to what followed to note where the relationship
between AMLASH/1 and CIA stood at that time. At page 13 of Book V
of the SSC Final Report the following statement appears:

", . . the CIA took steps to renew its contact

with a high-level Cuban official named AMLASH. -The

CIA's previous contact with him had been sporadic;

he had not been in contact with the CIA since

before the missile crisis of October 1962. The

exact purpose the CIA had for renewing contact is

not known, but there is no evidence the CIA intended

at this time to use AMLASH in an assassination

operation." *
The reason for there having been no contact since August 1962 was
simply that AMLASH/1 did not leave Cuba after that until September
1963. If it is narrowly correct to state that the "exact purpose"
for renewing contact was not known to the authors of the SSC Report,
it nevertheless is quite clear why he was met. He was an important
potential asset whose usefulness remained to be explored. At this
point, not only was there "no evidence (that) . . . an assassination
operation" was intended, it is quite clear that it was not under
consideration. The problem at the time was how to deal with the man.

At page 14 of the SSC Report it is stated that the first meeting



13-00000

in September 1963:

" . . . may have been to gain intelligence and to

cultivate him as an asset for covert operations . . ."
A 7 September cable, cited on another point in the SSC Report,
provides an insight as to how AMLASH/1 was assessed at the time, as
well as emphasizing the uncertainty in the minds of the case officers
of how to deal with him in the future:

“AMLASH cocky totally spoiled brat who will always

be a control problem . . (he) will not take time or

have patience prepare or receive constant stream S/W

messageS,let alone OWVL. AMLASH also needs strong

confidant inside who will push and serve as chaplain. . .

CIA headquarters replied on 9 September, saying in part:
"". . . Based on what little feel we here have for
subject however appears he is hopeless as intel]
performer and is best approached as a chief con-
spirator allowed to recruit his own cohorts among
whom we may then find persons susceptible to Tong
distance and covert disciplines... "

The cable then went on to spell out long-range requirements prior to

any action based on such internal organization as AMLASH/1 may put

together.

Clearly, at that point, while AMLASH/1 was viewed as potentially
important, he also was viewed as a person of uncertain capabilities,
requiring careful but long-range development for whatever course of

action that might later ensue.

Page 14 of the SSC Final Report cites the 7 September 1963,
cable reporting the first 1963 meeting with AMLASH/1 as follows:
“AMLASH was interested primarily in getting the
United States to invade Cuba, or in attempting an

‘inside job' against Castro, and that he was awaiting

a U.S. plan of action." (Empahsis added).
This suggests a plan of action targetted specifically against Castro
himself. That may have seemed implicit to the authors of the SSC
Report, but the actual language of the cable states it somewhat differently:
"AMLASH still feels there only two ways accomplish i
change either inside job or invasion he realistic
enough realize latter out of question. According
AMWHIP, AMLASH still awaiting for US reveal plan of
action."
COMMENT:
At this point, after a year out of touch with a
man with whom there had been no working understanding,
AMLASH/1's views were of interest, but were very general,
as might be expected after such a long time. The actual
reference to an “inside job" did not specify Castro,
as suggested in the SSC Report, but was. directed towards
the more general question of how to bring about change.
It was offered alternatively, in the context of con-
sidering both external and internal action, and not with

the specific connotation provided by the SSC presentation.

The point is, as stated in the SSC Report, that it left
AMLASH/1 “awaiting a U.S. plan of action." There was
nothing substantive or conclusive. To the contrary, things
were left very much up in the air.

Footnote 17 on page 14 of the SSC Report states that
“characterization of this phase of the AMLASH operation
is disputed." (Emphasis added). The footnote observes
that the SSC Interim Report on Alleged Assassination Plots
concluded that the AMLASH operation was an assassination
operation, which begs the question of what it was for "this,
phase" of the matter. In fact, the SSC Interim Report on
Alleged Assassination Plots notes specifically that “From
the first contact with AMLASH until the latter part of 1963,
it was uncertain whether he would defect or remain in Cuba."
(Page 86). The point is that the SSC Final Report, Book V,
itself describes the very general nature of the approach
by AMLASH/1, and the absence of a U.S. response (supra).
Any dispute over how to characterize the operation at that
time arises from the presentation of it in Book V of the
SSC Report. Reference to the dispute may reflect views
expressed by CIA representatives on reviewing the draft of the
SSC Final Report.

The next paragraph in the SSC Report, Book V, presents
in inferential sequence, an interview Castro held

with an AP reporter, Daniel Harker, in which Castro inveighed

gethel


13-00000

against anti-Cuban terrorist plans of U.S. leaders.

The intended inference, as is known from discussions with
SSC staff members, was that AMLASH/1 may have reported (or
leaked) to Castro what the authors of the report elected
to see then as assassination plotting. This characteri-
zation is even more explicit at pages 3-4 of the Summary
and Findings of the SSC Report, presenting the inter-
pretation as categorically as though it were fact.

The fact remains that whatever views AMLASH/1 may have
expressed, he had no response from his CIA contacts of
any support for his proposals at that time. Whatever
may have been the cause for Castro's remarks at that time
they could not have stemmed from anything said to
AMLASH/1 by CIA officers as they proposed nothing and
undertook nothing.

AMLASH/1 flew to Paris on 14 September, ostensibly to attend a
meeting of the Alliance Francaise. The trip actually was for an
extended vacation, which AMLASH/1 intended to report to Castro
after the fact. On 16 September he wrote AMWHIP/1 that he did not
"intend to see (be interviewed by) your friend again" referring to
the CIA case officer. On 3 October 1963 the case officer nevertheless
arrived in Paris to meet with AMLASH/1. Station officers were already
in contact with him, two of whom participated in meetings that followed.

On 11 October the case officer cabled Headquarters reporting that

AMLASH/1 claimed to have the "necessary people and equipment inside



13-00000

SECRET

[Cuba] to accomplish overthrow without [U.S.] assistance." AMLASH/1
was reported as wishing a meeting witha senior U.S. official,
preferably Robert F. Kennedy, for assurance of "moral support" for
any action AMLASH/1 undertook in Cuba. The cable recommended that
the. request for a meeting:

"be given highest and profound consideration as

feeling drawn by all who in contact AMLASH is that

he determined attempt op against [Castro] with or

without [U.S.] support."
A 21 October cable to Washington reported a 17 October meeting with
AMLASH/1--"Basically he wants assurance that [U.S.] will support him

if_his enterprise is successful." (Emphasis added).

Desmond Fitzgerald, then Chief of the Special Affairs Staff.
was going to Paris on other business and undertook to meet with AMLASH/1.
The plan for the meeting, written in advance, was outlined as follows:
"Fitzgerald will represent self as personal
representative of Robert F. Kennedy who traveled
to Paris for specific purpose of meeting [AMLASH/1]
and giving him assurances of full U.S. support if.

there is change of the present government in Cuba."

(Emphasis added).
On 29 October Fitzgerald met with AMLASH/1 in Paris, representing
himself as a spokesman of Attorney General Kennedy. The third person

at the meeting was the case officer, who served as an interpreter.



13-00000

On 13 November the case officer wrote a memorandum summarizing high-
lights of the meeting. It reads in part as follows:

"Fitzgerald informed [AMLASH/1] that the United

States is prepared to render all necessary

assistance to any anti-communist Cuban group which

succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban leader-

ship and assumes sufficient control to invite the

United States to render the assistance it is

prepared to give. It was emphasized that the
above support will be forthcoming only after a

real coup has been effected and the group involved

is in a position to request U.S. (probably under

OAS auspices) recognition and support. (Emphasis

added). It was made clear that the U.S. was not

prepared to commit itself to supporting an isolated
uprising, as such an uprising can be extinguished

in a matter of hours if the present government is

still in control in Havana. As for the post-coup

period, the U.S. does not desire that the political
clock be turned back but will support the necessary
economic and political reforms which will benefit

the mass of the Cuban people."

At the time of the CIA Inspector General's report on the subject

in 1967, additional details were elicited from Fitzgerald, who re-

12



13-00000

called that AMLASH/1 spoke repeatedly of the need for an assassination
weapon. He wanted a high-power rifle with telescopic sights, or some
other weapon that could be used to kill Castro from a distance. Fitzgerald
stated that he rejected this request. Fitzgerald's Executive Officer,
although not present at the meeting, was kept posted by Fitzgerald and
had a recollection the same as the one noted above. The case officer
is reported as not recalling the exchange on the weapon. His memorandum
stated that:

"Nothing of an operational nature was discussed at

the Fitzgerald meeting. After the meeting [AMLASH/1] stated

that he was satisfied with the policy discussion but now

desired to know what technical support we could provide him."

On 14 November 1963 AMWHIP/1 was met in New York City. He reported

on AMLASH/1's reaction to the 29 October meeting in Paris. The contact
report on what AMLASH/1 understood, as relayed by AMWHIP/1, is as
follows:

"The visit with Fitzgerald, who acted in the

capacity of a representative of high levels of

the Government concerned with the Cuban problem

satisfied [AMLASH/1] as far as policy was con-

cerned, but he was not at all happy with the fact

that he still was not given the technical assistance

for the operational plan ashe saw it. [AMWHIP/1]

said that [AMLASH/1] dwelt constantly on this point.

He could not understand why he was denied certain
smal] pieces of equipment which promised a final *
solution to the problem, while, on the other hand,
the U.S. Government gave much equipment and money
to exile groups for their ineffective excursions
against Cuban coastal targets. According to
[AMWHIP/1], [AMLASH/1] feels strongly on this point,
and if he does not get advice and materials from a
U.S. Government technician, he will probably become
fed up again, and we will lose whatever progress we
have made to date."
COMMENT :

At this point it is important to note that Agency
documents summarize what AMLASH/1 was to be told,
and what he was told, which matches a later report
of what he understood. In essence he was told there
would be no U.S. support until after the fact, and then
only if- he was successful. While that may not Seem a
very realistic way in which to bring about the overthrow
of a government, it is directly relevant to the question
of what AMLASH/1 was told and what he understood. It is
contrary to the statement in the SSC Final Report (page 18)
to the effect that it was not clear how AMLASH/1 inter-

preted the put-off by Fitzgerald.

Interesting confirmation of AMLASH/1's understanding
is provided by a July 1964 FBI report (mentioned variously
at pages 35, 72 and 74 of Book V of the SSC Report). This
report was from an FBI informant who stated that AMLASH/1
was unhappy with the CIA response and that Attorney General
Kennedy had refused to support the plan. Given the substance
of this aspect of the report it is apparent that although the
date of the report is June 1964, this particular information
dates back to 29 October 1963 when AMLASH/1 was told by
Fitzgerald, representing himself as speaking for Robert F.
Kennedy, that he would not be given support in this opera-
tion. While this is not the reason the FBI report was cited
in Book V of the SSC Final Report, it provides additional
clear confirmation that AMLASH/1 understood that he had

been turned down at the 29 October meeting.

Following the 14 November meeting with AMWHIP/1 CIA reviewed what

could be done to maintain the contact with AMLASH/1. On 19 November 1963

Fitzgerald “approved telling AMLASH/1 he would be given a cache inside

Cuba.

The cache could, if he requested it, include ...high-power

rifles w/scope..."

On 19 November AMLASH/1 told a CIA officer that he planned to

return to Cuba. On 20 November Headquarters cabled Paris requesting

that AMLASH/1 "delay departure...(to) permit one more meeting which

AMLASH/1 requested." On the same day (20 November) in response to

ee?

rv

oe
Pred
mm
ood


13-00000

a telephonic request, AMLASH/1 agreed to delay his departure “if it

is something interesting." The case officer told him that "he could not
assure it interesting but that it was to be a meeting which AMLASH

had requested." The cable reporting this exchange noted that it was

a "rapid conversation" inhibited by the presence of a second person

in the room.

The SSC Final Report (page 19) attempts to expand this brief
and cryptic telephone conversation into the "first indication that he
might receive the specific support he requested." More factually, and
quite significantly,; the Report acknowledges that no specific support
had been offered up to then. Beyond that it is at best a piece of
highly speculative analysis, not supported by the evidence.

The case officer from Washington arrived in Paris the morning of
22 November and met with AMLASH/1 late that afternoon. As they left
the meeting they learned of President Kennedy's assassination. They
probably were meeting when President Kennedy was shot.

Whatever the relationship with AMLASH/1 following the death of
President Kennedy, there is every indication that during President
Kensedy's 1ife AMLASH/1 had no basis for believing that he had CIA
support for much of anything. Were he a provocateur reporting to Castro,
or if he was merely careless and leaked what he knew, he had no
factual basis for leaking or reporting any actual CIA plot directed

against Castro.

Il. SPECIFIC SECTIONS OF THE SSC_REPORT

Section 1, B
This section of the SSC Final Report, the Summary, states that "it
places particular emphasis on the effect their (the intelligence agencies)
Cuban operations seemed to have on their investigation." It states
that the report "details these operations to illustrate why they were
relevant to the investigation." It states that presentation of the
AMLASH operation is to illustrate why that operation should have been
examined by the Warren Commission. -
The view of the Subcommittee, as to why the AMLASH operation
warranted such review, is summarized at page 5 of the Report as
follows:
"The AMLASH plot was more relevant to the Warren
Commission's work than the early CIA assassination
plots with the underworld. Unlike those earlier
plots the AMLASH operation was in progress at the
time of the assassination; unlike the earlier plots,
the AMLASH operation could clearly be traced to CIA;
and unlike the earlier plots, the CIA had endorsed
AMLASH's proposal for a coup, the first step to him
being Castro's assassination, despite Castro's threat
of retaliation for such plotting."
As stated in the preceeding discussion the AMLASH operation was

without substance prior to President Kennedy's death; it is particularly

7

SESRET


13-00000
SECRET

unsuited to make the Subcommittee's intended point. It is literally
accurate to note a coincidence in time, of the contacts with AMLASH/1
prior to the death of President Kennedy, but that is all. It is incorrect
to say that "CIA had endorsed AMLASH's proposal." There was no agree-
ment with AMLASH/1, or commitment to him, and even had Castro learned

of the contacts with him there was nothing to learn beyond the fact

of the contact. The relationship was most tenuous and without any
support promised to him for whatever he planned. Castro's "threat"

--as noted above--must be considered irrelevant to the substantive

nature of the AMLASH relationship at that time. :

This viewpoint was conveyed to the Subcommittee prior to publica-
tion of the report. At the same time it was observed that theoretically
there was greater possibility of leaks from the earlier operations
involving the criminal underworld, although there was no known evidence
of such leaks. While general rather than specific, this could have
provided more reasonable support for the Subcommittee's view that there as
were CIA operations that should have been reported to the Warren Commission.
The SSC Subcommittee saw otherwise, outlining its position at page 68
as follows:

“...it is unlikely that Castro could have
distinguished the CIA plots with the underworld
from those plots not backed by CIA. In fact,
the methods the CIA used in these attempts were
designed to prevent the Cuban government from

attributing them to the CIA."

SEGRET

The result this has on the present comment on the SSC Final
Report may seem anomalous. It places CIA in the position of ¢on-
testing the interpretation given the AMLASH operation in the ssc
Final Report, and to that extent the thesis that the presentation
was supposed to support. At the same time, however, we are
inclined to acknowledge in principle the possibility--not seriously
considered as a likelihood during the Warren Commission inquiry--
that other operations could have suffered the defects attributed
to the AMLASH operation by the SSC Report. In protesting the
presentation in one instance, and the specific conclusions it seeks
to support, the effect is to disagree with a substantial portion
of the report as written. On the other hand we tend to not contest
a general thesis that more specific attention could have been given
by the Warren Commission to the anti-Castro programs of the U.S.
Government, including CIA activities.

kK KEK KKK KEK KEKE
At page 4 of the SSC Final Report Desmond Fitzgerald, in a
meeting with AMLASH/1, is quoted as having:
“stated the United States would support a coup."
Again, at page 19, the report states that Fitzgerald:
“also gave general assurances that the United
States would help in bringing about the coup."
The last version is attributed to the case officer who was present at
the meeting in 1963, in his testimony before the SSC in 1975. This

presentation of the case officer's statements in 1975 does not match

19

SECRET


13-00000

the report of the meeting in 1963, which was written by him at the time.
In considering the processes by which this version came into Being, it
is noted that the following statement appears at page 87 of the SSC
Interim Report on Alleged Assassination Plots:

“Fitzgerald met AMLASH/1 in late fall 1963 and

promised him that the United States would support

a coup against Castro,"
citing testimony by the case officer who was present at the meeting.
An interesting footnote (#3) on that page reads as follows:

"3. The contact plan for the proposed meeting i

stated: ‘Fitzgerald will represent self as personal

representative of Robert F. Kennedy who travelled to

(foreign city) for specific purpose meeting AMLASH/1

and giving him assurances of full support with

a change of the present government in Cuba.‘"

(Emphasis added).
The underscored portion--the word "with"--in fact read in the actual
document "if there is." This substitution of language in a purported
quotation may seem only a matter of nuance, but it treats with what
Fitzgerald planned to say, which takes on special significance when
matched with the expressly limited statements that he actually made
(as discussed at pages 11 and 12 of this annex) and what AMLASH/1

understood (as discussed at pages 13-15).

for the investigation at the time of the Warren Commission as stating
to the SSC that had they known about the AMLASH operation in 1963 it
would have affected the investigation. It is only noted that it is
likely that views elicited from CIA employees in 1975 probably were
responsive to representations by SSC staff members as to what the
operation involved, as distinguished from what it actually was.

At page 24 the SSC Final Report contains the following

statement:

"According to the 1967 Inspector General Report,

CIA Headquarters cabled the AMLASH case officer on

the morning of November 23, and ordered him to break

contact with AMLASH due to the President's assassi-

nation and to return to Headquarters."
This statement is at least a literary extension of the statement of
the IG report, which was in its entirety as follows:

"[The case officer] states that he received an

OPIM cable from Fitzgerald that night or early

the next morning telling him that everything was

off."
The SSC was unable to get the case officer to support its expansion on
the reference in the 1967 IG report. His testimony is cited,
apparently despite suggestive prompting, that:

"9... he recalled receiving such a cable, but

could not recall whether it made specific mention

21

SECRET


13-00000

of the President's assassination as the reason for |
breaking contact..." i
It is noted that the cable was never found; it may never have been
sent, being a misrecollection of the case officer. In any event,
the two sources cited in the SSC Report do not support its version.

cc D

Footnote 30 on page 17 treats the question of the security of the
AMLASH operation. As noted in the above review of the AMLASH operation,
AMLASH/1 was on the record as expressing his disenchantment with the
Castro regime. He had told colleagues of his meetings with AMMHIP/1.
Through sensitive sources we know that other Cubans were aware of his
fulminations against the Castro regime. We do not know, beyond these
generalized statements, what he actually conveyed at that time to what
persons. We do know how little substance there was to his relationships
with CIA during this period, and how little he had to tell others were
he inclined to do so.

Assuming that AMLASH/1 was to attempt to organize a coup, he
obviously had to try and associate himself with people of a like mind.
To crystallize their support he might have felt constrained to convey
assurances of external support. To the extent that he may have, we
do not know whether he would have claimed to have been promised things
that in fact had been denied him. It was not until much later that the
question of security--always a consideration, especially when more than
one person is involved--became a point of sufficient concern for CIA

to break relations with him.



13-00000

SECRET

Some have speculated that AMLASH/1 was, in some way, Castro's
provocateur. Such a possibility is always a proper subject for
consideration. There are questions that feed the theory, but the
issue remains debatable. We do not offer an opinion here, although
we do note that he was rewarded strangely if he was. When finally
arrested he served ten years of a thirty-year term. His public trial
did not mention his Agency associations for the period March 1961 to
November 1964. An interesting consideration is that when Castro pro-
vided Senator McGovern with a list of persons the Cubans ciaifiied had the
mission of his assassination, although AMLASH/1 was among those
included, the reported period for his activity also omitted this
earlier period.

Kae RRR RK KR KE KKK

At page 26 of the SSC Final Report it is stated that on 24 November
the Mexico Station responded to a Headquarters request for the names
of known contacts of certain Soviet personnel in Mexico City. “The ssc
Report acknowledges that the purpose of obtaining these names was to
determine the significance of Oswald's contact with Soviets and to.
assess their activities. The SSC Report states that:

“AMLASH's real name was included in the list

of names on the Mexico Station cable."
This is used as a basis for a discussion in the SSC Final Report of why
the inclusion of that name in the cable did not lead to the identification
of the AMLASH operation.

The treatment of this point in the SSC Final Report seems to rest
on a misconception of the context in which the name of AMLASH/1 was
mentioned. The reference had to do with a contact between a member of

23

SECRET


13-00000

SECRET

the Soviet embassy and a Cuban cultural attache -- in December' 1960 --
about a press conference planned for AMLASH/1 in Mexico City"in
February and March 1961. It was not a report of a contact between
AMLASH/1 and the Soyiet, whitch was the subject of the inquiry; the
name of AMLASH/1 could well have been omitted from the cable. In

any event, the December 1960 date preceded the inauguration of
President Kennedy, which further removes the question from any
relevance to the subject. There was no reason to check the name.

The presentation in the SSC Final Report is confusing and mislead-

ing on this point.
KR RR KR RK KR KR KKK

Page 72 of the SSC Report refers to a July 1964 FBI report con-
cerning a CIA meeting with AMLASH. The SSC Report states "that the
purpose of those meetings had been to plan the assassination of
Castro." This is the same FBI report that helped confirm the
earlier turn-down of AMLASH/1 at the 29 October 1963 meeting (pages
14 and 15, this paper). While it stated that "there is now under
discussion some plan to kill Fidel Castro" (July 1964) it badly
mixes times and events. In any event, this aspect of the report
substantially post-dates the death of President Kennedy, and is

not directly relevant to the Warren Commission inquiry.

At page 75, the SSC Final Report quotes the testimony of the’ Chief,
SAS Counterintelligence. His recollections are very uncertain. He
is quoted specifically as saying that he could not recall the exact
time frame, which is central to analysis of the operation, and speaks
of his "vague recollections" that the Fitzgerald meeting was related
to an assassination plot against Castro. The SSC Report nevertheless
gives this opinion full play despite the extensive qualification as to
its reliability.

kek RR RRR KR RK KR -

At pages 68-75 of Book V of the SSC Final Report, consideration
is given to what was known of the AMLASH operation by certain CIA
employees, how they understood it, and what conclusions they could or
should have drawn from what they knew. The treatment seems to accept
as a premise that the relationship was an assassination plot throughout,
and overlooks the basically inchoate quality of the relationship with
AMLASH/1 during the period in question.

There will always be uncertainties in the developing relationship
with political action assets; that such was the case with AMLASH/1 is
noted in the discussion above. In the present instance the uncertainties
were recognized and clearly recorded, as well as the limits placed on
positions that would be and were taken with AMLASH/1. It is important
to keep this in mind in considering the testimony of witnesses, as

presented in the SSC Final Report.

25

13-00000

Different witnesses before the SSC would obviously view the AMLASH
affair in different lights, the basis for their understanding srelating
to different levels of knowledge at different periods in time. What
did they know in 1963, and what more did they learn under what circum-
stances at a later date? What they testified to in 1975--perhaps
on the basis of representations by SSC staff members as to what it
was--required quite a clear and precise treatment. The SSC Final
Report did not accord the subject that treatment.

Ke RR RK Re

At pages 78, 79 and 105 of the SSC Final Report reference is made
to a Cuban exile designated as "A," who informed the FBI and CIA in
mid-1965 of activities of AMLASH/1 in Cuba to eliminate Castro, and
of his involvement with CIA. A careful reading of the SSC Report made
it clear that "A" was unaware of AMLASH/1's 1963 associations with CIA.

This information, reported in the context of the badly blurred
time frame of the SSC Final Report, was given a significance that it
did not otherwise have. First, the information was a year and a half
after the death of President Kennedy. Further, the informant had no
knowledge of the earlier period of CIA-AMLASH/1 relationships. When
this is placed alongside the clear record of the inconclusive nature
of the relationships in the 1963 period, it becomes something of an
irrelevancy. It is noted that a footnote in the SSC Report, at this
point, records the fact that the book of material given to Senator

McGovern by Castro on persons who allegedly had plotted his

SEGRE


13-00000

secaet

assassination also contained no reference to that period, although

AMLASH/1's later activities were cited. -

Kk KR RR RR KR RR KK

It is useful to recap the sequence of events. The record shows
that initially there was uncertainty as to what AMLASH/1 represented
as a potential asset. There was early consideration of his defection,
which changed to his possible use for intelligence purposes. As his
self-discipline was assessed as being inadequate for this task it was
determined that it was best for him to go it alone, developing his
own organization for whatever followed. The reservations that were
held concerning his qualities were reflected in the specifically
conditional arms-length position taken with him during the period
preceding President Kennedy's death. He had to succeed with his
own program before he could expect support from the U.S.

Eventually -- but not until after the death of President
Kennedy -- firmer indications of support were offered. Even then
the volume of equipment promised was not large, especially to a
man who claimed to have the “necessary people and equipment inside
[Cuba] to accomplish (the) overthrow . . ." The nature of the
relationship never did firm up. As late as the fall of 1964
(page 77, Book V of the SSC Final Report) CIA was telling AMLASH/1
that it could not be associated with his concept of the first step
of a coup, which he viewed as requiring the death of Castro. While
one can reason that any association with AMLASH/1 included
association with all his plans, it nevertheless appears that those

directly involved structured their thinking differently.



13-00000 , : \

The Inspector General's report in 1967 treated the AMLASH
operation in its study of assassination, as did the SSC Interim ,
Report on Alleged Assassination Plots. At the time of the 1967 IG
report there was no issue of how to characterize the operation at
different times, and the question was not addressed. Facing that
question now, it is clear that however the operational relationship
developed after the death of President Kennedy, it was unformed and
without substance during his life. During that time it was not an
assassination plot. The treatment of this question in the SSC

Report is both imprecise and misleading.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of
limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission
inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts
of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and
submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted
to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)
and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation
is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,
to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that
effort.

Intelligence Sources on Oswald's Visit
to Mexico City in 1963

Ts fonsitlerei Coverage:
oF

From the time the Mexico Station was opened jin April
1947 Juntil the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Stationfin°?
1955] the Station had developed a support apparatus to exploit
leads from the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. This umbrella
type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multi-line phone taps, three
photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a mail inter-
cept operation. a
Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by (an enp lovee of
the local telephone company who was] handled by a Station case
officer. The number of lines tapped was limited only by the avail-
ability of a listening post nearby and the availability of language
(English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc.) transcribers.
Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-American recruited agents.
Three photographic sites were handled by.a Station case
officer assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who
advised the Station on the best types of cameras, films, and con-
cealment devices. These operations had sub-crypts under project
LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA). LIMITED was a
fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Embassy (across the
street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian entrance. The

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site. was diagonally across a
double laned street on the southeast corner of that block (See
attached diagram). LIMITED was the first photo base and opera-
ted strictly on an experimental basis in the early stages. This
base, however, was closed when the Station received word that the
photograph of the "unidentified man" was being released by the
Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photographic base.

It was located in an upper story of an apartment building on the
same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in the middle of
the block south. It had a planted view of the front gate of the
Soviet Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located
in one of a row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet
Embassy compound. This site overlooked the back garden of the
Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this operation was to get
good identification photographs of Soviet personnel. The three
photographic sites were managed by a recruited agent who was a
Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother and Mexican father
(deceased). This agent collected the film from the LIMITED and
LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then ‘devleoped and
printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was ori-
ginally processed in the Station but in early [1399] due to the
resignation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and

LILYRIC was processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American

staff officers. These two officers organized a surveillance
team of six recruited agents which used late model cars and a
: panel truck for surveillance. The team could be activated by
radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of interest left
the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs
for identification purposes.

A Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the
listening post and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes.
There was also an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage: is

In mid-1962, (the Mexican an charge of LIENVOY

(the joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the
LIENVOY listening) post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, —
Cuban and Satellite Embassies infanticipation of edssible cover-
age.) The Station inmediately [i sconnected all of the FMateral
telephone taps on these Embassies so that they would not be dis-
covered when the Mexicans hooked up their taps. The Mexicans |
soon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five Soviet lines,
three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav line. At
the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of con-
versations of interest which were then included in a daily re-
sume for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely
recorded, full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station;
however, there was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels

which contained Russian or a language other than Spanish or



13-00000

SEGRET/ SENSITIVE

English were taken to another location for translation and i
typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian translations but
because of the volume of Russian conversations, the trans-
lations usually ran about a week behind the date of the con-
versation. All transcripts were made in either Spanish or
English since the Chief of Station could read only these two
languages and because he personally screened the transcripts
for operational leads.

As soon as the Station learned that an American iden-
tifying himself as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss
Ann Goodpasture of the Station started screening all photographs.
However, here again, there was a backlog because the photographs
were picked up three times a week, but those picked up were usually
for dates a few days before since the technician who was proces-
sing the film did so on a night-time basis. Further, photographs
were not made initially until a complete roll of film was used.
Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera at the
end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.
The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours)
and to photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners,
and cars with foreign license plates. Human error did occur but
generally the agents were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy cover-
age had more sophisticated equipment using a pulse camera which

frequently developed mechanical difficulties.

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post
operators from a tap of the Soviet line. It was picked up and
taken to Mr. Boris Tarasoff for translation because the caller
was trying to speak in Russian. There was some delay because
Station personnel waited to review the photographs coincidentally
with the typed transcript.

3. Factual information on matters covered in the article
follows:

a. ‘Alpha 66 was an anti-Castro Cuban Exile
Organization. Antonio Veciana was one of its
founders. Veciana contacted the Agency on three
occasions for assistance in an assassination plot
against Castro (December 1960; July 1962 and April
1966). On each occasion he was turned down. The
Agency had no responsibility for or sponsorship of
Alpha 66.

b.. Veciana was registered in the Inter-Se
Registry by the U.S. Army for the period Hov
1962 to July 1966 at which time he was terminated
without prejudice.

c. Veciatia reportedly collaborated with a Cuban
Governmant Intelligence Officer, Guillermo Ruiz, in
connection with Alpha 66 activities. Ruiz is married
to a cousin of Veciana.



d. Anderson attempts to co Fane Morr
Bishop with CIA in Dallas; nei pers in
have tried to identify Bishop with our DCD repre
sentative in Dallas, Mr. J. Walton Moore. A
cording to our records, no Agency officers ever
used the name of Morris Bishop as an alias. No
one named Morris Bishop was ever emptoyed by the
Agency.

e. The FBI identified the three men who
visited Mrs. Odio. Lee Harvey Oswald was not
one of them. The Warren Commission was satis-
fied that Oswald could not have been in Dallas
at the time of the visit.

SUBJECTS : A. Jack Anderson 20 January 1977 Column

Titled "CIA Tied to False Oswald Story"

B. Identification of the Mr. X in the
Anderson Column

1. The attached column, citing the testimony of a Mr. X,
alleges that a CIA agent tried to link Oswald to Cuban intelli-
gence officers in Mexico. There is, of course, no substance to
the column's allegations. The column identifies the source as
Mr. X because of attempts on his life, but subsequently gives
enough information. on Mr. X to establish his identity.

2. According to the Anderson column, Mr. X was first met
by his CIA contact in Havana before relations with U.S./Cuba were
severed. Mr. X had helped to organize bank accountants to em-
bezzle Cuban government funds to finance anti-Castro causes.
Mr. X was reportedly recruited by a Morris Bishop (CIA contact),
to"plan an attempt on Castro's life. The plan was to fire a
bazooka from a nearby apartment building while Castro was deliver-
ing one of his marathon speeches. According to the Anderson
column, the plot was discovered by Castro's police and Mr. X
escaped to Miami. Mr. X also reportedly tried to assassinate
Castro in Chile in 1971 in league with the Venezuclan Luis Posada
Carriles, who is now being detained in Caracas for the 6 October
Cubana airline bombing. The Anderson column ends with the report
that Mr. X worked for CIA until 1973 for expenses, but ‘was paid
$253,000 in cash by Morris Bishop when he was terminated.

From the above description of Mr. X, it is reasonably
that Mr. X is Antonio Carlos VECTANA Blanch (201-312966)

ECLANA, ant bank manager and past president of a public
accountants dssociation in Havana, first contacted C
in December 1960 when he asked the COS, at that time
to help in an assassination plot against Castro. V

and also requested four MI rifles with adapters for. grenades pl
eight grenades. The COS did not encourage VECIANA and subsequently
checked with an Embassy officer who reported that IANA had made
similar "wild-eyed" proposals to him. On 23 November 1961 the
Miami News published a report of an unsuccessful attempt by Antonio
VECIANA to kill Castro. VECIANA reportedly had arranged to
assassinate Castro and. Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos on 5 October
in Havana, but the bazooka he was using: failed to fire.

4. There has been no Agency relationship with VECIANA. A
POA, which was granted for his use in para-military affairs in
January 1962, expired in November 1962. VECIANA was born on
4 October 1935 in Havana. He was a member of the People's Revo-
lutionary Movement, an anti-Castro group. in Cuba during 1960-61, and
was one of the founders of Alpha-66. A certified public accountant
by trade, VECIANA was with A.1.D: in La Paz in 1968-72. VECIANA
was registered in ISR to the U.S. Army in November 1962 and he
was terminated without prejudice in July 1966. On 23 July 1962
VECIANA was interviewed,’ at his request, by Mr. Harry Real from
the DCD New York office. VECIANA asked Real to arrange a meeting
with a senior CIA officer to discuss Alpha-66's plans to assassinate
Castro and to request CIA's assistance (U.S.$100,000; 10,000 Cuban
pesos; 48 hand grenades). There is no indication that this request
was ever acted upon by CIA. _

"S. In April 1966 a LA Division officer, (a using
the alias John Livingston, met VECIANA in New he

meeting was arranged by a retired naval officer, nes Cogswell,
who ‘had informed ee = Division that he had information of valuc

concerning Cuba. When arrived in New York City for the meeting,
he was introduced by Cogswell to IANA. He, imaediately launched
scussion of the Cuban political situation and noted his strong
ng that the only solution was the assassination of. Castro.
advised VECIANA that he was in no position to provide him with
assistance or cncourage him in an assassination attempt and was only
interested in gathering information which he thought was the purpose
of the meeting. VECIANA subsequently said that his roommate Felix
ZABALA, a_Cuban refugee, had excellent contacts’ in Yiavana. It was
clear to however, VECIANA was attempting to v ZABALA poten-
tially to get Agency financial support for his organization.

: i SobccuRnEaT



VECIANA suggested that $50,000, would be necded to get his |

factivities off the ound, indicated to VECTANA that he
would look into the ZABALA watter and would probably arrange for
ZABALA to be contacted in Puerto Rico.

6. TYhere‘is no indication in the file that any Agency officer
in contact with VECIANA ever used an alias Morris Bishop. There is
no Morris Bishop listed in true name in the DDO rells. There was
never any contractual relationship with VECIANA and he was not
paid CIA funds.

7. On J1 January 1977 a sanitized copy of VECIANA's 201 file |
was made available to staffers from the Senate Select Committee on™ ~

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Counterintelligence Staff

FROM : Russell B. Holmes
CI Operations Group

SUBJECT + Article by Norman Kempster Appearing in
the Los Angeles Times of 1 January 1977
and Entitled "CIA Withheld Data on Oswald"
(copy attached)

In light of the inaccurate and misleading statements
attributed by Kempster to Sprague, the following comments are
offered in rebuttal.

a. "The CIA withheld from the FBI for almost
two months in 1963 information that Lee Harvey Uswald
had talked with Cuban and Soviet officials about his
desire to visit those countries...

Comment: Oswald's name did not surface in Mexico City until

T October 1963 when a hitherto unknown male telephoned the
Soviet Embassy. During this telephone call, the caller identi-
fied himself as "Lee Oswald." On 8 October 1963, the Mexico
City Station cabled to Headquarters the highlights of the
transcript of the conversation.

(1) On 1 October 1963, an American male who
spoke broken Russian and said his name was Lee
Oswald (phonetic), stated he was at the Soviet
Embassy on 28 September when he spoke with a consul
whom he believed to be Valeriy Vladimirovich
Kostikov. Oswald asked the Soviet guard Ivan
Obyedkov, who answered, if there was anything new
regarding a telegram to Washington. Obyedkov upon
checking said nothing had been received yet, but
the request had been sent.

(2) Mexico Station said it had photographs of
a male who appeared to be an American entering the
Soviet Embassy at 1216 hours, leaving at 1222 on
1 October. His apparent age was 35, athletic
build, about six feet, receding hairline, balding
top. Wore khakis and sport shirt.

(3) No local dissemination was being made by
the Station. [MEXI 6453 (IN 36017), 8 October. ]

(Note: Cablese has been rendered here into readable English,
without substantive changes or omissions. Cryptonyms and
pseudonyms have been omitted or put into clear text.)

The above information was received in Headquarters on
9 October; the following day Headquarters incorporated this
information in an electrical dissemination to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, the Department of State, the Department of
the Navy, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

(1) On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive
source in Mexico reported that an American male
who identified himself as Lee Oswald, contacted the -
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring whether the
Embassy had received any news concerning a telegram
which had been sent to Washington. The American
was described as approximately 35 years old, with an
athletic build, about six feet tall, with a "receding"
hairline.

(2) It is believed that Oswald may be identical
to Lee Henry [sic] Oswald, born on 18 October 1939
in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine who
defected to the Soviet Union in October 1959 and later
made arrangements through the United States Embassy
in Moscow to return to the United States with his
Russian-born wife, Marina Nikolaevna Pusakova [sic]
and their child.

(3) The information in paragraph (1) is being
disseminated to your representatives in Mexico City.
Any further information received on this subject
will be furnished you. This information is being
made available to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. [DIRECTOR 74673, 10 October 1963. ]

(Note: It should be pointed out that for some unknown reason
the Headquarters desk responsible for making the dissemination
neglected to include the information that Oswald had visited the
Soviet Embassy on 28 September 1963.)

It was not until 22 November 1963, when the Station initiated
a review of all transcripts of telephone calls to the Soviet Embassy



13-00000

«

that the Station learned that Oswald's call to the Soviet Embassy
on 1 October 1963 was in connection with his request for a visa
to the USSR. Because he wanted to travel to the USSR by way of
Cuba, Oswald had also visited the Cuban Embassy in an attempt to
obtain a visa allowing him to transit Cuba.

Inasmuch as Oswald was not-an investigative responsibility
of the CIA and because the Agency had not received an official
request from those agencies having investigative responsibility
requesting the Agency to obtain further information, the Station
did nothing other than ask Headquarters on 15 October 1963 for
a photograph of Oswald. [MEXI 6534 (IN 40357), 15 October 1963.]
On 25 October 1963, Headquarters sent a request to the Department
of the Navy for a photograph of Oswald. [DIRECTOR 77978,

24 October 1963.] It was not until 26 November 1963, however,
that the Navy Department apparently responded to this request by
sending directly to the Mexico City Station a photograph of Oswald.

In response to a question from the Warren Commission, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, on 6 April 1963 stated that:

"The investigation of Oswald in 1963 prior to receipt
of the Central Intelligence Agency commmication

dated 10 October 1963 was directed toward the primary
objective of ascertaining the nature of Oswald's
sympathies for, and connection with, the FPCC (Fair
Play for Cuba Committee) or subversive elements. The
Central Intelligence Agency commmication which
reported that a man, tentatively identified as Oswald,
had inquired at the Soviet Embassy concerning a
telegram which had been sent to Washington did not
specify the nature of the telegram. This contact

with the Soviet Embassy interjected a new aspect into
the investigation and raised the obvious questions of
why he was in Mexico and exactly what were his
relations with the Soviets. However, the information
available was not such that any additional conclusions
could be drawn as to Oswald's sympathies, intentions

or activities at that time. Thus, one of the objectives
of the continuing investigation was to ascertain the
nature of his relations with the Soviets considering
the possibility that he could have been recruited by
the Soviet Intelligence Services. The Central
Intelligence Agency commmication, dated 10 October 1963,
stated that any further information received concerning
Oswald would be furnished and that our liaison repre-
sentatives in Mexico City were being advised. On

T



13-00000

Bae ers

18 October 1963, one of our FBI liaison repre-
sentatives in Mexico City was furnished this infor-
mation by Central Intelligence Agency and he arranged
follow-up with Central Intelligence Agency in Mexico
City for further information and started a check to
establish Oswald's entry into Mexico. Subsequent to
the assassination, Central Intelligence Agency also
advised us of Oswald's contact with the Cuban Embassy
in Mexico City at the time of his visit there."

[Commission Exhibit No. 833 (FBI Letter to J. Lee Rankin,
dated 6 April 1964).]

b. "Chief Counsel Richard A. Sprague said that the
committee staff had 1 et at_a CIA message des-
cribing Oswald's activities in Mexico to federal
agencies such as the FBI had been rewritten to elimi- -
nate any mention of his request for Cuban and Soviet
visas. The message was sent_in October, more than a month
before the November 22,1963 assassination.”

Comment: It is not CIA practice to disseminate raw information in
the form it is received from the field. Field reports are received
in Headquarters where they are first reviewed by the action desk.
The information is then written in a form suitable for dissemination
to the intelligence commmity, including additional information,

if available, from the Agency's central counterintelligence files
to make the report more meaningful to the recipient (s).

Upon learning that on 1 October 1963 an American identifying
himself as Lee Oswald had telephoned the Soviet Embassy, the Mexico
City Station cabled to Headquarters on 8 October 1963 the highlights of
Oswald's conversation with the Embassy. Because the Station at that -
time did not know that Oswald was Lee Harvey Oswald and that he had
come to Mexico to apply for visas to the Soviet Union and Cuba, the
Station reported only that information obtained through telephone
tap operation against the Soviet Embassy.

On 10. October 1963, the day after it received the information
relating to Lee Oswald and his contact with the Soviet Embassy,
Headquarters incorporated this information in an electrical dissemi-
nation to the commmity and included a brief summary of biographic
information obtained from central counterintelligence files on the
possible identity of Lee Oswald. Since Headquarters had no indi-
cation before 22 November that Oswald had gone. to Mexico to apply
for Cuban and Soviet visas, there was no question of eliminating any



13-00000

mention of Oswald's request for such visas.

Within its limitations and capabilities, Mexico Station had
complied with the Agency regulations pertaining to reporting on
Americans abroad. The Station.had informed Headquarters which in
turn had alerted those agencies with an investigative or policy
interest in Oswald as an American in the United States. Headquarters
also instructed the field station to inform the local representatives
of those agencies.

As mentioned above, the action desk in Headquarters neglected,
for unknown reasons, to include the fact that Oswald had visited
the Soviet Embassy on 28 September 1963. Had this information been
included it would have indicated to recipients of the report that
Oswald had more than a fleeting reason to be in contact with the
Embassy; however, as already stated, the reason for the 28 September
contact and the subject of the telegram to Washington were, at that
time, unknown.

c. "The CIA's decision to withhold information
was reversed shortly after Kennedy was killed.”

Comment: This statement is patently false and misleading. It is
totally incompatible with Sprague's remarks to Agency representatives
in Headquarters on 24 November 1976, i.e., "he will not prejudge the
Agency for any sins of 'omission or commission'."

d. "Sprague told a press conference that it was
impossible without more information to know why the CIA

had censored its own message."

Comment: If Sprague needed more information, why did he not ask
the Agency for an explanation, instead of making it appear to the
public that the Agency has been dishonest in its dealings with the
intelligence commmity?

e. "But he said the incident raised two interesting
questions: what might the other agencies ‘have done
differently if they had been more ly informed, and
why did the CIA decide to remove ‘information that was
considered pertinent enough to be put in an initial

draft _o: e message?’

Comment: As already mentioned, the Agency did not know initially
why Oswald was in contact with the Soviet Embassy in October 1963.



13-00000

It was only after the news of the assassination had reached the
Station that the Station initiated a review of its holdings. As
a result of this review, the Station learned that Oswald had also
visited the Cuban Embassy and that Oswald's contacts with the two
embassies were in connection with his desire to travel to the
Soviet Union by way of Cuba.

As to what "other agencies'' might have done had they had more
information, attention is drawn to the FBI's comment in response
to the Warren Commission's question. According to the FBI's
response, some investigation had been initiated on or about
18 October in Mexico. By the 25th of October, FBI headquarters had
informed its field office in New Orleans "that another Agency had
determined that Lee Oswald was in contact with the Soviet Embassy
in Mexico City in the early part of October 1963." The New Orleans
field office in turn informed the Dallas office which had juris-
diction over Oswald's place of residence. (For further detail, see
IV H 447 and 459.) There was, however, no request, official or
otherwise, from any of the responsible departments and agencies in
Washington for further details as to Oswald's presence in Mexico
and his reasons for contacting the Soviet Embassy.

f. "The committee said its staff investigators
had recently questioned a former CIA agent who had
"personal knowledge’ of Oswald's visits to the Soviet
and Cuban embassies in Mexico. As a result of that
interview, the report said, staff members were sent to

Mexico, where they Found and questioned additional
witnesses."

Comment: Sprague's characterization "a former CIA agent'' is probably
in reference to David Phillips. The latter's "revelations" to staff
investigators (and also to Ronald Kessler) were unfortunate to say
the least, in that they were inaccurate, so far as we know. There

is no indication in the Oswald files that Oswald wanted to make a
deal with the Soviets in return for a free trip to the USSR. The
“additional witnesses'' in Mexico, it is believed, are Boris Tarasov
and his wife, both of whom had been under contract with the Agency
in 1963. We have not been informed, officially or otherwise, by
Sprague what Phillips and the Tarasovs told the staff investigators.

ig g. " 'These witnesses had never been sought out
before by any investigative body, nobel thstanting the
fact that they had important information concerning
Statements by Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico within 60
days of the assassination of President Kennedy,' the

report said."



13-00000

*
Comment: If "these witnesses" include people other than the Tarasovs
it would be impossible, at this time, to make an appropriate comment.
The fact remains, however, that if Sprague had obtained additional
details, he should hold such information and not make it public
until the Agency has had a chance to review it and comment. There
are many examples in the Oswald files of statements made by people
claiming to have knowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald which have been
proven to be fabrications. One such person was Gilberto Nolasco
Alvarado Ugarte who, on 26 November 1963, came to the U.S.
Embassy in Mexico City. He claimed he had been in the Cuban
Consulate in Mexico City on 18 September 1963 when a man he later
recognized to be Lee Harvey Oswald received $6,500 in cash to kill
an important person in the United States. After thorough investi-
gation by Mexican authorities, the Mexico City Station, and the FBI,
it was concluded that Alvarado had completely fabricated his story
about Oswald.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence
VIA : Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : John H. Waller
Inspector General

SUBJECT : President Kennedy Assassination - Mrs. Luce Story

1. Action Required: None; for information only.

2. Background: In 1975, Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce telephonically
informed Director William Colby of support she had rendered to certain
Cubans who were conducting their own independent operations against
the Castro Government in 1961 and 1962. Mrs. Luce stated that she and
Mr. William Pawley, an American financier long associated with the
Dominican Republic, helped finance a motorboat for three Cubans. The
three Cubans, concurrently, were members of a CIA supported Cuban
exile organization. After the 1962 missile crisis, all resistance
groups against Castro were ordered to cease operations. At this time,
Mrs. Luce and Mr. Pawley also ceased their financial support. In
1963, very shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy, the
Cuban captain of the motorboat, which Mrs. Luce helped. to subsidize,
phoned Mrs. Luce to inform her that "Oswald was a hired gun". She, in
turn, informed him to tell all to the FBI. At the behest of Director
Colby, Mrs. Luce passed the story on to Senator Richard Schweiker,
chairman of the subcommittee investigating the Warren Commission Report.

A version of the information was given to columnist Betty
Beale and was published in the Washington Star on 16 November 1975
(attached). A staff member of the Senate Select Committee, on 10
December 1975, inquired as to what the Agency thought of the story.
The Agency oral response was that it had nothing to add to the news-
paper story and that since this query involved U.S. resident Cuban
refugees, the FBI would be the proper agency to contact.

The transcripts were received by CIA's Inspector General
on 22 December 1976 from Mr. Colby's secretary. At the suggestion
of the Inspector General, the Office of Security sent copies of the
transcripts and a background note to: the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation in January 1977. We do. not know whether the FBI passed this
information to the House Select Committee on Assassinations.

This story is summarized here for your background in the
event that it should be replayed. by the press as a result of releases
which may be made by the House Assassination Subcommittee. While it is
not a new story, the actual CIA transcript of Mrs. Luce's conversation
with Mr. Colby could be considered newsworthy and could be presented
in a manner detrimental to CIA.

One day in the latter part of October, Clare Luce re-
ceived a call from Sen. Richard Schweiker, R.-Pa.,
chairman of the subcommittee investigating the War- ;
cen Commission Report. He wanted her to persuade
3ome Cubans she had known — Cubans who had krown
Lee Harvey Oswald — to testify before his committee.
Mrs. Luce’s efforts to locate the Cubans led to a some-
what bloodcurdting warning. But let her tell the story ‘
irom the beginning.

“The year is 1961, a year of great American H
trauma,” she began her narration to recent dinner |

ests in her aqua-colored Watergate apartment. “I
nad a friend named Bill Pawley who was brought up in
Cuba and who was Truman's ambassador to Peru and
Brazil. I got to Know Bill very well in India and China !
where he had built up a voluntary outfit called The
Flying Tigers. Bill was also called in by the CIA to re- |
cruit Cubans for the Bay of Pigs operation. Afterwards
he was a very unhappy man. : . +

“One day he called me up and said, ‘How would you
like to get in on the Cuban Flying Tiger operation?” He
had in mind a fleet of moterboats subsidized by Ameri-
cans and manned by Cubans who had been in the Bay
of Pigs operation — all these young kids who had been
stranded after the Bay of Pigs. = 3

“I said, ‘Fine.’ So I helped to finance a motorboat. |
‘The three lads who manned rine Came up to see me!
several times. They would leave the coast of Florida
and land in Cuba and come out with information. The
information they came out with was remarkably accu-;
rate — that the Russians were building missile sites in !
Cuba. I was told that thé information was eventually |
fed to Sen. Ken Keating and was passed on to the}
White House. You remember what an impression it
made and how accurate it was.

“THEN CAME THE MISSILE showdown. Soon after
the showdown I got a telephone call from Allen Dulles |
saying the Neutrality Act had been invoked and all
American's must cease and desist in any further efforts |
iowards the liberation of Cuba. Of course, we desist-:

‘Mrs. Luce; I {

“He said that immediately after th? 196] missile |
showdown, FBI men had come to Miami and told the |
Cubans to break up all resistance groups and disperse.
He and the other two members of his crew had moved
to New Orleans where they started another “Free
Cuba” group. They had been there a year and a half
when who made contact with them but Oswald!

“The Cubans all thought he'was a kcok. Oswald
bragged about having been in Russia and Said he was
an ex-Marine. He said he could shoot anybody and he
would be happy to shoot Castro. He had no money, he
was livii ith his wife in New Orleans and it looked
like he was presenting himself as a hired gun. They
didn’t like the cut of his jib so they turned him off. But |
they followed him and found he was in a Fair Play for
Cuba Communist cell to whose members he was giv-
ing the same line. 5 4

“And I remember this from the telephone conversa- ;
tion ~ Oswald was telling the cell that he could shoot
anyone, including the secretary of the Navy. The Free |
Cubans continued to tail him and found that suddenly
he had money, and he started going to Mexico City. He
made several trips. They continued penetration

recordings of some of Oswald’s meetings and they had
taken photographs of him distributing handbills for the
Fair Play unit. The next thing they knew President
Kennedy was shot. 2 a

“THE YOUNG CUBAN WHO called me,” continued |
former Ambassador Luce, “said that # was at

In any event, on the telephone my young friend told
me that they had these tape recordings of Oswald and
photogranas and what should they ¢o? I said, ‘Go to
the FSi and tell them everything you know.’ That kav-
whole thing out of my mind.
Comes the Warren Commission and says Oswald alone
was responsible and I forgot the whole matter. -

“Then, in 1967, a fellow named Jim Garzison, dis-

trict attorney in New Orleans, hit the headlines charg-
ing that the assassination was a conspiracy. At that
moment I was reminded of the information I had re~
ceived and I began to wonder whether or not the
Warren Commission had got all the facts. I couldnt
remember the names of the Cubans but I finally locat-
ed one crewman who was living in Miami again and
asked hira what happened after he went to the FBI.

“He said, ‘We turned over copies of everything. We
were then told.to keep our traps shut and that we
would be deported if we said anything publicly.’ He
said one of the crew was deported to Guatemala, and
one was murdered — stabbed in front of a store.

“eTHISTR INFORMATION, HE SAID, never appear- |

Luce less than three weeks ago, she telephoned anoth-
er Cuban friend to see if he could locate and persuade
the young man to testify behind closed doors. Replied
the older Cuban, if the testimony was behind 13 closed
doors it would still become public. 2. 7: 7
“Americans think they. are playing games,” he told

her. ‘They don’t know they are involved in a life or ~

Geath business. No, I won't tell you where he can be
found. The people working for a free Cuba would lose
their lives. A lot of them have already. They are not
interested in making political headlines for politicians.
You think the Bay of Pigs, the nuclear missiles, the
assassination of the president was the end af the story?

. .L tell you it is just the beginning. What you Americans

don’t understand is, there are trained Communist ter-

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Transcripts of October 1975 Telephone Conversations
Between Director Colby, Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce and
Mr. Justin McCarthy

1. Attached herewith are transcripts of two telephone conversations
between Director William Colby and.Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce, and one between
Director William Colby and Mr. Justin McCarthy. The conversations took
place in October 1975 and discuss Mrs. Luce's concern that certain infor-
mation, from a former boat captain, a Cuban refugee, regarding the Presi-
dent Kennedy assassination, reached the proper authorities. While the
information in these transcripts have been provided to investigating
authorities, they may be of some assistance to the House Select Committee
on Assassinations as it ‘investigates various allegations.

2. The transcripts were received by the Agency Inspector General on
22 December 1976. The transcript of the 25 October 1975 conversation was
typed by Ms. Barbara Pindar on the same day. The other two transcripts
were typed by Ms. Pindar on 21 December 1976 from her stenographic records
while clearing out the remainder of Director Colby's files. Ms. Pindar
was Mr. Colby's secretary during his Directorship. z

3. A.version of the telephone conversation transcript was published
in the Washington Star on 16 November 1975 (attached). A staff member of
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on 10 December 1975, inquired
as to what the Agency thought of the story. The Agency oral response was
that it had nothing to add to the newspaper story and that since this
query involved U.S. resident Cuban refugees, the FBI poule be the proper
agency to contact.

Telephone Conversation B.-veen Mr. Colby and Mrs, Gla Boothe Luce
at 12:40 on Saturday, 25 October'1975 (from steno notes of Barbara Pindar
transcribed the same day) E

Mrs. Luce: Ihave a big problem, a case in conscience. I got rather
deeply involved during and after the Bay of Pigs, and up to the time of
the missile crisis, with a group called the (Directorate Revolutionario
Estudiante; ‘Note: the spelling of that is just a guess), the DRE. Whether
you know this or not, it was me who fed the missile stuff to Keating. I
knew a number of these leaders well; they were going in and out of Cuba,
and I paid for one of the motor boats. Bill Pawley did too. We thought we
were doing another Flying Tiger. The missile crisis came, and I gota
telephone call from Allen telling me that the Secrets Act had gone into
effect and that henceforth there would be no voluntary American efforts.
That ended that, and I don't know what I was doing -- maybe I went back
to Arizona; or whatever. Then came the assassination. The night of the
assassination, right after Oswald was caught, one of my boys telephoned
me from New Orleans. Didn't I ever tell you this? a

Mr. Colby: No.

Mrs. Luce: It was the captain of my boat. . It seems that after the missile
crisis -- a period of about a year had gone by -- he said that all the young
Cubans involved profoundly in all of this had been told to scatter and
scram, that he and two of my other lads --

Mr. Colby: When, after the crisis?

Mrs. Luce: (Yes.) (were told) to leave Miami.

Mr. Colby: In 1962?

Mrs. Luce: “Yes. They were to stop their efforts to free Cuba; and if they

did not, they would be deported. It has a very interesting end involving you.
In any event, this one had been told to leave Miami after the missile crisis
was over, and he had opened a cell in New Orleans. He telephoned me to

" tell me that Oswald was -- Iam telling you what his view was -- was a
hired gun; Oswald had tried to penetrate their little cell; that they turned
around and did a counterpenetration job on Oswald; all of this was done
several months before the assassination. He said,-telling me on the phone,
he was terribly excited -- he said you see he had no money, all of a sudden
he began to get money, so we checked him and he had a little "Communists
be Free" or 'Be Fair to Cuba" group going in New Orleans." He said "We —



had tape recordings of what he was telling his group." It was a w unter-
penetration they went on. He said, 'We have photographs of Oswald,
passing out handbills on the street, 'Be Fair to Cuba.'" He said, "We
are absolutely certain that Oswald was simply one of three assassination
teams, that they were working out of Mexico City (or funded in Mexico
City) by Castro." He said there were three assassination teams. Then
he said, “We have these recordings, these tapes, and we have these
photos, what should we do?" These fellows always trusted me. I said,
"The first thing you do, the minute you hang up this phone, you telephone
tothe FBI, give them everything you have got.'' Working in New York
with these:Cubans is an extraordinary fellow, one of the most puzzling’
characters I have every met; he is.a devout Catholic -- Justin McCarthy.
Justin is the American patron: -- although he has no money, never had
money -- of all these free Cubans in America. He never worked at CIA,
although CIA tried to pick his brains. He tried to help the FBI. I knew
Justin McCarthy, and he used to send me bulletins; he said he had been
sending them to me for the past six months, and I had never received one
of them. Out comes. the Warren Report. I have many other things to do,
and I assureny lads had reported what they knew, and maybe it had been
discounted, but I had taken the Warren Report at face value without poring
over it -- and I forgot the whole darn thing. Then, this must be nine
years ago, up turns a guy ones Lloyd Garrison*-- what was he, a eae

or something? (@ She wens Zim Goer: sm)
Mr. Colby: District Attorney.
> Mrs. Luce: And he hit the headlines that the assassination had been a con-

.spiracy. Then it all flooded back into my mind that I had never been quite
satisfied with what the Warren Report had brought out. - Basically, I was
troubled by the whole thing, so I said I thought I would call Garrison. -

In order to call him, I had to have the names of the Cubans, which had
gone out of my bean. Sol called Justin McCarthy. He, said one of them
was now, my lad, was in Miami. I got him on the phone, my fellow, and

I said, ''You remember your midnight call to me about the assassination

_of the President, I want to know what happened after that." He said, "We
went at once to the FBI, they took all the tapes and photos and all our
information and told us to keep our mouths shut, and shortly after that they
informed us that if any of us talked to the press or anyone, dire things
would happen.'' He said one of the fellows on the boat was deported to
Guatemala or Chile, and one of them was murdered. He said, "lama
lawyer, have two children, 1am making my way in Miami, and I never
want to hear a damn word about the-assassination of Kennedy because you
Americans really do not want to know the truth."" He said, 'We waited,
expecting the Warren Committee would want to have us, and welnever heard
a word." He said, ''I want no part of it." Then the Garrison thing died

. down, and. I am a busy woman, and I forgot about it. Three days ago,

a reporter was in here -- a gal’-- asking about my life style and
said, in passing, "What do you think of the investigation of the
assassination of the President?" I am afraid I hit the roof? I said,

"I think everyone must be absolutely off their rockers, ‘What possible
motive would the CIA have for murdering their own President?" I
said, "Even to assume such a thing is beyond belief because where
there is a murder or assassination, there is a motive, and there could
be no motive." I said, 'Who had the motive was Castro; but perhaps
not even Gastro, possibly just a bunch of Communist Cubans or plain.
Communists."' I said, "They always had a motive for that sort of
thing. '' Schweitkker called me up yesterday -- when the reporter said
tome, "What is the name of the young Cuban?", I said,. "Well, let's

call him Julio Fernandez. '' The Senator said to me "that is a fascinating :
story." wT missch ke Cee *hot Awe giek WE Qo ke wed
WIAh Knight Htwsigagers

Mr. Colby: You told the story to Schweiker?
Mrs. Luce: He read it in the Knight paper.
Mr. Colby: You told the story to the Knight people?

Mrs. Luce: Not in the detaill told you. Schweiker asked if I could locate -

any of these men involved for him, and I said I would try. That was
yesterday. I used that opportunity to say, "I do not know what you are

“doing on the Hill." I said, ‘You are in the process?) for headlines and

destroying this country's security." He said, "If you have this informa-
tion and you can get your hands on it, it would be a good thing to lay
this story to rest. """ He said, "If you can find me these people, I assure
you they will be listened to in closed session.'' Now comes the big
thing. Justin McCarthy runs an animal farm in Nyack: telephone
number is 914; 647-8596. I have known him to be a man of complete
integrity. He is a devout Catholic. He may or may not be a fanatic,
What makes one think he is is what he tells you is just so terribly
alarming; as he was the one, along with Bill Pawley, who involved me
with these Cubans, I tracked him down and had a two-hour conversation
on the phone with him this morning that was really staggering. When I
said to him, "Would you tell these things in the closed session in the
Senate?", he said, "I would find it more expedient and to shorten the
process to hire loud speakers and put them on top of the Empire State
Building." He said, 'You don't know, Clare, the Cubans have not lost
their desire to free their country, and there are plenty of them working

at it, and they trust me, and I trust them, and they all trust me."

He said, ''All these fellows on the Hill give a damn about is a big
headline and political attention, and if this should involve nly testi-
fying and some of my fellows got bumped off, or their apparat shut
down, I could not live with myself, no I will not testify." I said,

"You know, Justin, if they send for you, you might have to." He

said, "They are not likely to send for me unless you tell them." He
said, "They do not know who to ask for anyway."' (It doesn't appear

in my notes, but my memory is that he added that the reason the Hill
doesn't get to the truth is that they never know who tb ask for.) He
told me a story about working once with CIA. He said, "We did this --
DRE did one operation with CIA, as a result of which all the Cubans
involved were caught and killed, and I do not want any part with the
CIA." He said, "It too can be a sieve." I said, ‘You have me really
over a barrel."' I said, "Justin, I have to tell someone, is there
anyone you trust?" He said, "There is only one man in this whole
country whose word at this point I would take." I said, 'Who is that?"
and he said, "Bill Colby.""' He said, "He is a daily communicant" --

Mr. Colby: ‘No, no.

Mrs.. Luce: I did not disillusion him. In any event, if only to put my own

mind at rest since -- he always says, which is fascinating if true,
that my lads in New Orleans, yes, they did turn over the tapes to the
FBI but they kept copies. :

Mr. Colby: Really?

to say. If what he says is true -- he also told me, which I had forgotten --
that during the time of the missile crisis, and I was the one he came to,

I could trust him. Ina way, Justin McCarthy supplied a lot of background

a few days ago -- Time is planning to do a (take-out) issue onthe -
assassination of Kennedy. He said that, going back through their files,

" they came across my name’as an informant, and he said they tracked me

down.too.'' He said, then he told me -- I mentioned in passing that there

almost than anyone in CIA, Priscilla Badger. He said the Time
people are now trying to get information. He said, "I will talk to

no one because there are lives at stake" -- except you. Fo# my

own sake, if you have a go at him, I would be very happy to know how
serious it is. :

Mr. Colby: I will report back to you by all means. Let me do a little home-
- work on just where this (looks). You do not remember the name of the
Cubans in Miami?

Mrs. Luce: There are so many names; he talked to me so fast. He kept
saying "Chilo." I asked hela "Chilo" is, and he said that was his code
name.

Jose Antonio La Nuza (Note: “that last name may be all one word;
she said it means "the nut. "')
Luis Fernandez Rocha a eee

One of those fellows was the Director of the DRE. Then he also reminded
me of a guy who used to come to see me -- Cardona, (He had been told
by the American Government to get out of Miami) and he died, having
- become the President of a university in Puerto Rico. These fellows

were scattered all over the place... As I mentioned thatto Justin, he said,
"I know where they all are.'' The thing that alarmed meis that ~~ he
does not talk in an excited voice, but the statements are -- he said
"People think of the Bay of Pigs and the nuclear showdown and the
assassination of Kennedy as the end of the story, it is only the beginning."
He said, "If you knew what is’ being laid on for the U. S.," and he talks
like that. I asked him, "What do you think happened?" He said, "Oswald
went to the FBI." He said, "I know that, he was selling them information,
and they did not believe him." I said, "That is incredible." He said, "I
do not know how much you know about the FBI, but no day goes by without
desks being loaded with letters saying something will be blown up."

(Note: I missed a little bit here due to something else happening in the
office..) I said, 'What happened?" and he said, 'The FBI got the word
from on top 'Destroy the letters. '"" : mo Hes

Mr. Colby: From on top?
Mrs. Luce: From the President, who was Johnson. I contended that if at

that point the FBI had proven that Castro had in mind assassinating the
President, we would have been in war with Cuba. It might have been

an act of State to shut up about it. If I had been the Presidént, I
would have had (Note: missed more due to outside interference).
What is hideous about this is that the CIA is being accused or i
Kennedy is being accused -- anyone except the people who probably
were involved. If putting it at rest in a secret session will work,

if such evidence does exist, you are the man to present it.

Mr. Colby: Schwéker does not know about McCarthy?

Mrs. Luce: He only knows this -- I said there is one man I know who .
might be able to tell you where the se Cubans are, and. that isa fellow .
named Justin McCarthy. He said, "Where is he?", and I said,’"Ido |.
not know, I have lost track of him." He said, "If you find him, let me
know." After talking with Justin McCarthy, I do not want him to talk
to Schweiker, I do not know what to say if he calls again.~ Knowing t the
Senator, I may never hear from him. I leave it with you.:

NOTE: Mrs. Luce closed the conversation by referring to a CIA paper

Telephone Conversation Between Mr. Colby and Justin McCarthy at 3:45

on Tuesday, 28 October 1975 (this transcript was typed on 2] December 1976.
from steno notes of Barbara Pindar)

*
Mr. McCarthy: Iam glad to know you, even if it is over the phone.

Mr. Colby: Mrs. Luce talked to me yesterday (sic). She gave me a capsule
version of some of her chat with you, It puts me ina bit of a jam,
obviously, because there are some things that really hold some
potential for being very important in these days (of) post-mortems
of everything. I wondered if maybe we should chat about it some-
time, or, quite frankly, one of the main things I would suggest is
that you might want to go to this Senate Committee looking into this,

Mr. McCarthy: No,” There are several reasons why not. lam sure we do
not need to discuss them, but there are many reasons. Over the
period of time there have been so many things, We were theonly
ones who had the information about the missiles in Cuba for many
months, and we. beat our brains out trying to get someone to do
something (or believe?) and regrettably (in) Washington there are
too many political (opportunists?), but there are too many lives at
stake. We risked our neck for all these years. We are interested
in doing the right thing. : :

Mr. Colby: I wondered if you could (slice?) off that New Oxneans thing ad
not go any further than that?)

Mr. McCarthy: As I said to her -- (can't read the next few words). _For me
to be seen in Washington, it is (can't read the next few words), We

“do not trust anyone.’ We did so many operations for so long, and

we were entirely.successful and never lost a man, and then one day
we did an operation for the Government and lost 22 men. Lives
depend on it. Someone sent a Top Secret memo, and the one he
sent it to left it on his desk and someone came in and read (it) and
the men were arrested. She asked, "Would you talk to Bill?" I
said I would. We think it would be a good idea -- for me to go down --
Ido not want to blow my cover, but I would like very much to chat with
you and tell you,

Mr. Colby: My problem is then I get information, and then what are my
obligations.

Mr. McCarthy: From the point of view of (seeing?) how to do it ieeouel persons
other than me -- to get the end result. eateea

Mr. Colby: It might be that one of your fellows aware of some of the things ©
(would not mind telling Schweiker?) under some protection and
assurances of anonymity. That would be enough of a (can't read the
next word) to get started.

Mr. Colby: Then (he?) could cut your people aut as a source,

Mr. McCarthy: - She said it wo uld be aclosed-door hea ring. I said there (would?)
still be someone come out of the meeting and (can't read next word)
their names in the press. You see Jack Anderson's column on Monday.
It is vitally important, and it is true evidence, It is not conjecture,
Iam concerned about what it ties into -= it is all the same ball of wax,
We sat on the information about the missiles. This has been going on
for a good twenty years, and we have accumulated an awful lot of
information. We are more concerned today than when we had the
missile information, It is appalling, and it is frightening, and people
do not want to believe it. Last night I enlightened people about some of
the things that are going to happen, We feel the time has come that
some of this should come to light. It is necessary and essential. to go
back and bring out some of these things that need to be brought out, but
not at the expense of (next-word missing), We have done this on our *
own and at our own expense. One of the reasons my people trust me is --
Iam thinking of a book -- we did not want to do a book before, The
American public wants to know. It is all part of what went on then,

I think it should be clarified and straightened out what went on then,

But lam so terribly wary. I went to everyone,- including the President,
about the missiles. We had evidence -~ what ships they were on,
where they (docked?), anda few days later they came back and said
there is no credibility of what you say. : “

Mr. Colby: The only thing that bothers me is the story about the existence of
some records (you?) still hold. The important part of that is that
' indicates some (part?) of a failure, or possibly even worse -- that
is the kind of thing that does need investigation or (correction?) -- :
protecting your people that are in on it. The other possibility would
be to ask Schwdker or one of his men to go and talk to you or one of
your people who would have factual knowledge of it.

Mr. McCarthy: When (Dorothy) told me about you over a period of time --
(Dorothy) said we have been through this so many times -- I took
this to editors of Life. .That was the time when the guy sent the

Iam ananimal nut. A lot of the guys eee some of this stuff
that they would not normally do.

Mr. Colby: Let me talk with Clare again as to how we handle = The main

thing is not so much the overall stuff about Cuba -- the rhain thing

is the story about records, about Oswald. That comes at a time
when that is a serious subject of study here by the Congress. If we
could in some way shake that information loose without putting the

jn terms of clarifying the record against the (facts?) -- this is a very
key aspect of it anda very serious eo Aedes that if it was suppressed

Mr. McCarthy: That is not all that was as dete

Mr. Colby: That i is the thing. They are looking into it. Let me talk to Clare

again and see if I can figure out some way in which we could talk to

you (maybe?) and if you could in the meantime think of a way of

(feature?) of it so that you give the (final result?) but not the sourcing,
and let the investigators (find their own source later on?}, we would
have done our duty.. My problem is that I really cannot sit on it with
my obligations. I can be*reasonable about protecting other people,

to proper investigations of things that really should be looked into,

Mr. Colby:. Icanassure you lam as interested (as) you in protecting that

we put our minds to it. Let me talk to Clare and see what really ~~

Telephone Conversation Between Mr. Colby and Clare Boothe Luce at 4:07
on Friday, 31 October 1975 (this transcript was typed on 22 December 1976

from steno notes of Barbara Pindar)

Mr, Colby: I got the Restless Youth for you. And I called Justin McCarthy,
We hada long chat. He does not want me'to do anything about it,
but I said you put me in an awful position. (Note: The "you" there
refers, I believe, to McCarthy.) I understand what you mean about
his strong manner of talking. I think both of us are (hung?) witha
rather ta ntalizing: story. :

Mrs. Luce: If I had not known the guy for 25 years, I would take sees much
less seriously. i:

Mr. Colby: The only real point is the thing about the tapes and the photos and
the allegation about the FBI. I tried to (argue?) him into figuring out
some way in getting rid of those but keeping himself out Of the act.

Mrs. Luce: He called me back and said he talked with you and that you left
him ina box, and I think he feels now that there is some kind of a
question of conscience involved. He said, "Iam going to let you and
Bill Colby decide what is best to do, "

Mr, Colby: I said I would be in touch with you aa add to figure out something
sensible,

Mrs, Luce: Why don't we suggest that he bring you.or me -- perhaps he feels
safer with me --~ the tapes and photos if he bas copies of them,

Mr. Colby: And then you pass them over to Schweiker,

a Mrs. Luce: And let them decide, and I will maintain his cover -- he keeps

) saying it is not worth it to him after all these years to blowthat --
the paradox, he tells me he is going to have to write a book (and
whether he is indeed going to?) so that he is not altogether a crackpot.
On the other hand, what he is doing.is sufficiently crackpot, He is
taking care of broken-down animals from his entire area, However, --

Mr. Colby: I think that is a good idea. You say that you and I have talked, and
we are all ina kind of box at this point, and we really in conscience
cannot sit on this stuff -- all these charges that there is remaining
evidence that (can't read next word) was held backand disappeared

into the FBI, and maybe the way to do it is for him to provide it to
you, and you to Schweiker, and then I would just as soon drop out --
it does not really have much to do with me -- and in that way you
would protect him from Schweiker, and you would say you got it from
a friend -~- and the source is whatever, he and you agree on,

Mrs. Luce: I will do that.

Mr. Colby:. I think that is the best thing to do. If he does not buy that, I do not :
know what we do about Schweiker. :

Mrs. Luce: (I am going to ignore it if Schweiker comes to me.)

SUBJECT: Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE, Students'
Revolutionary Directorate)

The DRE was founded by a group of students at Habana
University in 1954 as an instrument of opposition to the regime
of President Fulgencio BATISTA. The original members of this
group were also members of the Habana University Student Federa-
tion (FEU). Several leading members of the DRE were killed by
Cuban authorities during and following the attack on the
Presidential Palace, Habana, in March 1957. The remaining DRE
leaders, as of 1958, were in exile. The DRE worked as a secret
underground organization in Cuba, generally in Habana, laying
plans and making preparations. The theory of the DRE was that
success of the revolution depended on quick and efficient
elimination of BATISTA which Fidel CASTRO's forces at that time
could not achieve alone. The DRE finally turned against CASTRO
on the issue of communism.

As of March 1962 the DRE was receiving $9,000 a month from
the Agency for salaries of 55 assets in Miami, Florida, and
$2,000 a month for overhead costs. The DRE's overseas program
(AMBARB's) at that time received $12,400 a month from the Agency.
Agency support to the DRE was terminated by mid-1967

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Comments on Ronald KESSLER's Article: "CIA
Withheld Details of OSWALD Cail," which Appeared
in the Washington Post of 26 November 1976

The following. comments are keyed to the attached Washington
Post article, i.e., the paragraph numbers below correspond to the
Paragraphs as numbered in the margin of the xerox of the article:

1. COMMENT: While CIA knew that a man identifying him-
self as Lee OSWALD had been in touch with the Soviet Embassy by
telephone on 1 October 1963, this information had no unusual
significance until 22 November 1963 when President Kennedy's
assassination occurred. At that time an intensive review was
made by the Mexico City Station of conversation transcripts pre-
pared on the basis of the 1 October telephone intercept. These
transcripts had been reported to Headquarters and disseminated to
the interested members of the intelligence community (as a former
Marine, OSWALD was a Navy and FBI case, and potentially of inter-
est to the Department of State). This review turned up “matches",
i.e., similar materials intercepted on 27 and 28 September 1963.
These were reported by cable to Headquarters on 23 November 1963.
There is no indication in the transcripts that Lee Harvey OSWALD
tried to make any "deal" with the Soviet Embassy as claimed in -

the Washington Post article.

Analysis based upon actual voice comparison could not
be made because the tapes, in accordance with the normal practice,
had been erased for re-use. The monitor was able to recall some-
thing of the voice characteristics from memory, however. He could
recall the very poor Russian spoken by OSWALD, for example.

2. COMMENT: This statement is not substantiated by our
files.

3. COMMENT: The information regarding the 1 October 1963

- contact with the Soviet Embassy -- received in Headquarters on

9 October -- was disseminated on 10 October 1963 to the Department


13-00000

of State, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department
of the Navy, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service..

A copy of the 10 October 1963 dissemination was made available
to the Warren Commission on 24 March 1964. (See Memorandum
for J. Lee RANKIN, dated 24 March 1964, from Richard HELMS,
Deputy Director for Plans; Subject: CIA Dissemination of In-
formation on Lee Harvey OSWALD, dated 10 October 1963.) On

16 October 1963, our Chief of Station sent a memorandum to the
American ambassador on the subject of Lee OSWALD's contact with
the Soviet Embassy. The original of this memorandum was routed
to the ambassador, the minister, the counselor for political
affairs, the regional security officer. A copy was sent to the
legal attache, naval attache, and the IaNsS.

In April 1964, Messrs. COLEMAN, SLAWSON and WILLENS,
staff representatives of the Warren Commission, visited the U.S.
Embassy in Mexico City. Our Station then indicated that the
three men already knew "all about" the telephone conversations
OSWALD had. According to the Memorandum for the Record of 11
April 1964, the three men reviewed the product from the tele-
phone tap operation for the days 27, 28 September and 1 October
1963 when Lee OSWALD contacted and visited the Cuban and Soviet
Embassies. They made a "schedule" of OSWALD's activities as far
as possible for these days from this source. Note: They were
shown English translations of the product, or "take", as it was
called. (HMMA 23249, 14 April 1964: This document, in a sani-
tized and declassified version was made available to the public
under provisions ‘of the FOIA in March 1964 as Document Number
274 and in September 1976 as Document Number 658) See follow-
ing:

4. COMMENT: See comments in Paragraph 3, above. «

5. COMMENT: The Agency disseminated the information
concerning OSWALD's contact with the Soviet Embassy on 1 Octo-
ber to the Department of State, the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, the Department of the Navy, and the Immigration and
Naturalization Service on 10 October 1963. On 23 November 1963
the Agency disseminated to the FBI the transcripts of the tele-
phone calls made on 27, 28 September, 1 October, and 3 October
1963. (The latter call, it was determined, did not pertain to
OSWALD.) (See CSCI-3/778,829, dated 26 November 1963.) On 23
November 1963, the Agency disseminated to the FBI information
relating to OSWALD's contacts with the Cuban and Soviet Embas-
sies in Mexico City.

6. COMMENT: OSWALD's alleged offer of information and
suggestion that the Russians pay his way to the Soviet Unian
does not appear in Agency transcripts of OSWALD's telephone .
conversations with the Cuban and Soviet Embassies.

7. COMMENT: OSWALD was in no sense "under investiga-
tion" (before 22 November 1963). None of the facts of his trip
to and stay in the USSR and return to the United States, 1959-
1962, were known to the Mexico Station before 10 October 1963,
when the bare bones of his biography were forwarded by Headquar-
ters to it in response to a Station cabled report of 8 October
1963 which forwarded, on a routine basis, what appeared to be
a contact by an American for a visa to Cuba in transit to the
USSR. It should be pointed out that the voice intercept cover-
age was not processed in "real time". The means of acquisi-
tion and the volume of the information precluded anything but
the spot reporting of items judged by the monitor to be of more.
than ordinary interest. Full texts of selected items required
a full transcription and full translation. One of the "trig-
gers" that normally operated to focus and accelerate more speedy
review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence was the
mention of a name. This was what occurred in the second of two
conversations on 1 October.with the Soviet Embassy, during which
the speaker said he was "Lee OSWALD". This was the first time
that the name OSWALD appeared in the intercepts and was report-
ed by the Station to Headquarters (8 October 1963).

Had, at any time, a person telephoned the Soviet
Embassy, identified himself, and offered information in ex-
change for a trip to the Soviet Union, it would have triggered


13-00000_

a

an immediate reaction by the monitor and the Station --
first, to identify the speaker; second, to report the infor-
mation to Headquarters; and third, to step up technical and
photographic surveillance.

8. COMMENT: No comment.

9. COMMENT: Tapes were not “routinely destroyed".
Tapes were erased after transcription had been made and re-
used. :

Full transcripts of calls made on 28 September 1963
and 1 October 1963 were forwarded to Headquarters on 23 Novem-
ber. The person who processed the transcripts was identified
in the cable. There is no indication in the transcripts that
OSWALD offered information or that any omissions were made which
might have contained that information. .

10. COMMENT: No comment.
V1. COMMENT: Files do not support this statement.
12. COMMENT: Files do not support this statement.

13. COMMENT: The information "given by DURAN" is sup-
ported by her interrogations.

14. COMMENT: "OSWALD later referred in.a letter to
‘meetings' he had in the Soviet Embassy." Although KESSLER
chooses not to give details, this statement is in reference
to a letter OSWALD wrote on 9 November 1963 to the Consular
Division of the Soviet Embassy in Washington. (Commission™ 7
Exhibit No. 15, Vol. XVI of the Hearings before the President's
Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy.)

15. COMMENT: No additional comment.

16. COMMENT: With regard to the press statement that
"CIA claimed it did not know of most of OSWALD's activities in
Mexico City until after the assassination": this is true, CIA
did not know of his activities, other than those revealed in
the intercepts. It should be noted that after the dissemination
on 10 October 1963 of the 1 October 1963 contact, no requests
were received from the dissemination customers for further in-
formation or follow-up. Without some customer interest being
expressed, particularly from the Navy, the FBI or the Department


13-00000

of State, who had the greatest interest in OSWALD at the timed,
there would have been little motivation for the Station to in-
dependently pursue such a tenuous CE lead.

17. COMMENT: The discussion in this paragraph of the
article rests on assumptions and allegations developed earlier
in the article, followed by comments by Messrs. BELIN and
SCHWEIKER, apparently based in turn on information provided
them by reporters. No further comment seems relevant, beyond
those comments made earlier.

18. COMMENT: Is BELIN here referring to Gilberto
ALVARADO Urgate? If so, information regarding OSWALD provided
by ALVARADO was passed to the Warren Commission as attachments
to a memorandum for J. Lee RANKIN,.dated 1 June 1964, from
Richard HELMS, Deputy Director for Plans.

2 (See also Memorandum for J. Lee RANKIN, dated 4 June
1964, from Richard HELMS; Subject: Information Developed on the
Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City. This memorandum
became Commission Exhibit No. 3152 contained in Vol. XXVI of
Warren Commission report.)

19. COMMENT: We do not know what BELIN actually said to
the reporters, when, or in response to what. We believe, how-
ever, this may be referring to BELIN's letter of 15 April 1975
to E. Henry. KNOCHE of CIA. BELIN at that time was Executive
Director of the Commission on CIA Activities within the United
States (Rockefeller Commission). In his letter, BELIN refers to
the photograph of an American male and the question whether or
not this male was Lee Harvey OSWALD. He continues:

"The CIA and the Warren Commission both
determined that the picture was not of Lee
_Harvey OSWALD and that the picture was taken

after OSWALD left Mexico City.

"Although portions of this record have
been released to the public, other portions
have remained classified because of concerns
by the CIA at the time that a release of the
full picture might disclose sources and
methods which the CIA felt were not in the
national interest to disclose at that time.
In light of the false allegations about the
assassination of President Kennedy and the

a


13-00000

false allegations of CIA involvement, I «
feel that it would be appropriate to re-

consider whether or not the entire matter

can be fully disclosed at this time."

An interim reply was forwarded on 23 April 1975 by
E. Henry KNOCHE, Assistant to the Director, CIA. On 2 May’
1975 a review was completed of Agency holdings regarding the
photograph of the unidentified individual in Mexico City pub-
lished by the Warren Commission. This review also included
knowledge of OSWALD's contacts with the Cuban and Soviet Embas-
sies obtained from telephone tap information and interrogations
of Silvia DURAN, a Mexican employee of the Cuban Embassy. On
13 May 1975 two summaries of the above review, one classified
and one unclassified, were forwarded to BELIN by the Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI Staff
FROM : Russell B. Holmes

SUBJECT : "Oswald Reportedly Told Cubans of Plan
‘to Kill JFK" by John M. Goshko, Washington
Post, 13 November 1976.

1. The memorandum"...by the late FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover saying that Lee Harvey Oswald reportedly
told Cuban officials in advance of President Kennedy's
assassination that he intended to kill the President"
is cited in Commission Exhibit No. 3152, Volume XXVI,
of the Hearings Before the President's Commission on the
Assassination of President Kennedy pp. 154-157 (See Tab A).
CE No. 3152 is cited in support of statements made by the
Warren Commission in it's Report on pages 307-308 (see
Tab B). This memorandum is based upon information which
the Agency had passed to FBI Headquarters and it's repre-
sentative in Mexico City.

2. On 26 November 1963, the Mexico City Station
reported to Headquarters that a Nicaraguan named Gilberto
ALVARADO Ugarte (referred to as "D" in the Warren Report)
came to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. He claimed he
had been in the Cuban Consulate in.Mexico City on 18
September 1963 when a man he later recognized to be Lee
Harvey Oswald received $6,500 in cash to kill an important
person in the United States. (See Tab A for complete
memorandum. ) : : :

3. The information obtained from ALVARADO was passed
in Mexico City to the Legal Attache, Mr. Clark D. Anderson,
by our. Chief of Station on 29 November 1963 (See Tab C).



A short dissemination (DIR 85744) alerting customs agencies
to ALVARADO's allegation, was made on 29 November: 1963

to the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
and the Department of State (see Tab D). A second dis-
semination (DIR 87667) was made on 7 December 1963 (see

Tab E). (NB: In the latter dissemination, mention was
made that a representative of the FBI participated in the
interrogation of ALVARADO.)

4. On.13 December 1963, the Agency forwarded under
CSCI 3/779, 136 a translation of the Mexican police
interrogation hones on Gilbarto ALVARADO Ugarte (see
Tab F).

5. In.summary, the Agency and the FBI knew of _
ALVARADO'’s allegations concerning Oswald, which were sub-
sequently retracted by ALVARADO himself as being false.

In addition, the FBI was able to prove that Oswald was
still in New Orleans at the time ALVARADO claimed he saw
Oswald in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. The information
was forwarded to the Warren Commission by the Agency and the
FBI as evidenced by its inclusion in the bel thet Commission
Report. and accompanying exhibits.

Mexico City in early September to receive money and orders for the
assassination,®*” that he had been flown toa secret airfield somewhere in
or near the Yucatan Peninsula," that he might have made contacts in
Mexico City with a Communist from the United States shortly
before the assassination,®* and that Oswald assassinated the Presi-
dent at the direction of a particular Cuban agent who met with him in
the United States and paid him $7,000.27 A letter was received from
* someone in Cuba alleging the writer had attended a-meeting where
the assassination had been discussed as part of 2 plan which would
soon include the death of other non-Communist leaders in the Ameri-
cas’™ Tha charge was made in a Cuban expatriate publication that in
aspeech ha delivered 5 daysaiter the assassination, while he was under
the influence of liquor, Fidel Castro madea slip of the tongue and said,
“The first time Oswald was in Cuba,” thereby giving away the
fact that Oswald had. made one or more surreptitious trips to that
country => ee : a

Some stories linked the assassination to anti-Castro groups who
, allegedly were engaged in obtaining illicit firearms in the United
States, one such claim being that these groups killed the President as
part of a bargain with some illicit organizations who would then
: 2. supply them with firearms as payment.” Other rumors placed

~ Oswald in Miami, Fla, at various times, allegedly in pro-Cuban ac-
tivities there." ‘The assassination was claimed to have been carried
out by Chinesa Communists operating jointly with the Cubans’?
Oswald was also alleged to have met with the Cuban Ambassador in
2 Mexico City restaurant and to have driven off in the Ambassadors
car for a private talk" Castro himself, it was alleged, 2 days after
the assassination called for the files relating to Oswald’s dealings with
tivo members of the Cuban diplomatic mission in the Soviet Union;
the inference drawn was that the “dealings” had occurred and had
established a secret subversive relationship which continued through _
Oswald’s life*™ ‘Without exception, the rumors and allegations of
8 conspiratorial contact were shown to be without any factual basis,
in some cases the product of mistaken identification, :
‘Illustrative of the attention given to the most serious allegations. _
‘is the case of “D,” a young Latin American secret agent who ap-
proached U.S. authorities in Mexico shortly after the assassination
and declared that he saw Leo Harvey Oswald receiving $6,500 to kill
the President. Among other details, “D” said that at about noon on
September 18, waiting to conduct some business at.the Cuban con-
Sulate, he saw a group of three persons conversing in 2 patio a few
: feet away. One was a tall, thin Negro with reddish hair, obviously
‘dyed, who spoke rapidly in both Spanish and English, and another
was a mon he said was Lee Harvey Oswald. A tall Cuban joined the
group momentarily and passed some currency to the Negro. The
Negro then allegedly said to Oswald in English, “I want to kill the
man.” Oswald replied, “You're not man enough, T can do it”? The
Negro then said in Spanish, “I can’t go with you, I have a lot to do.”
Oswald replied, “The people are waiting for me back there.” The

Negro then gave Oswald $5,500 in large-denomination American bills,
saying, “This isn’t much.” After hearing this conversation, “D” saiq
that ho telephoned the American Embassy in Mexico City severa}
times prior to the assassination in an attempt to report his belief thar
someone important in the United States was to be killed, but was
finally told by sorneona at the Embassy to stop wasting his time.

“D” and his allegations were inunediately subjected to intensive
investigation. His former a1 employment as an agent for a Latin Ameri-
can country was confirmed, although his superiors had no knowledge
of his presence in Mexico or the assignment described by “D.” Four
days after “D” first appeared the U: ‘S$. Government was informed by
the Mexican authorities that “D” had admitted in writing that iB
whole narrative about Oswald was false. He said that he had never
seen Oswald anyplace, and that he had not seen anybody~paid money

- in the Cuban Embassy. He also admitted that he never iried to tele-

phona the American Embassy in September and that his first call to

“* the Embassy was after the assassination. “ID” said that his-motive in
- fabricating the story was to help get himself admitted into the United

States so that he could there participate in action against Fidel Castro.

. He said that he hated Castro and hoped that the story he made up

would be belived and would cause the. United States to “take action”
against him,

“Still Tater, when questioned by American authorities, D” claimed
that he had been pressured into retracting his stetement by the Mex-

. ican police and that the retraction, rather than his first statement,
«was false. A portion of the American questioning was carried on

with the use of a polygraph machine, with the consent of “D.” When
told ihat the machine indicated that he was probably lying, “D” said
words to the effect that he “must be mistaken.” Investigation in the

* meantime had disclosed that the Embassy extension number “D” said

he had called would not have given him the person he said he spoke

. to, and that no one at the Embassy—elerks, secretaries, or officers—
_ had any recollection of his calls. In addition, Oswald spoke little, if

any, Spanish, That he could have carried on the alleged conversation
with the red-headed Negro in the Cuban Embassy, part of which was

” supposed to have been in Spanish, was therefore doubtful, “D” now

said that he was uncertain as to the date when he saw “someone who
Tooked like Oswald” at the Cuban Embassy, and upon reconsideration,
ho now thought it was on a Tuesday, September 17, rather than Sep-
tember 18,. On September 17, however, Oswald visited the Louisiana
State Unemployment Commission in New Orleans and also cashed 2

check from the Texas Employment Commission at the Winn-Dixie’

Store No, 1425 in New Orleans. On the basis of the retractions made
by “D” when he heard the results of the polygraph examination, and
on the basis of discrepancies which appeared in his story, it was
concluded that “D” was lying*” .

‘The investigation of the Commission has thus produced no evidence
that Oswald’s trip to Mexico was in any way connected with the assas-

. Sination of President Kennedy, nor has i it uncovered evidence that the

was nota shadow of doubt in hig mind, :

OSWALD was wearing a black sport coat, buttoned up

white shirt with short collar tabs, no tis, datk gray pants and

clear eyeglasses. (Subject stuck to this story that he was
wearing eyeglasses despite the fact that they were not present

Director of Central Intelligence
FROM : Raymond A. Warren

Chief, Latin America Division

VIA : Deputy Director for Ope rations

SUBJECT : Possible Accusations Against ‘the CIA

1. On 30 July 1976 at 1630 hours, Latin America Division
was advised by Mr. Tom White of the Office of Legislative
Counsel that he had just talked on the phone to a staff aide
of Representative Thomas Downing, Democrat of Virginia. The
staff aide told White that Representative Downing had just
received information from a Mr. Robert Morrow, author of a
recent book (Betrayal) on the John F. Kennedy a5oes-+netson,
Morrow provided this alieged information to the Los Angel
Times, New York Times, a Richmond newspaper (1
perhaps), and others. According to this information, which
the staff aide said is to appear in the New York Times on
Sunday, 1 August:

a. President Richard Nixon promised a Mr. Mario
GARCIA Kohly that if an invasion of Cuba were successful;
Nixon would arrange that all Cuban leftists outside
Cuba would be killed.” The implication was that these
killings would be carried out by the CIA.

b. British overflights froin the Bahamas. Showed
that there were Soviet missiles in Cuba as early as
1960, and.they were not removed until 1964. President
Kennedy Knew of this information, but withheld it from
the public.

m

2. The staff aide said that Representative Downing plan
to call a press conference on Monday, 2 August, to disclose
the above information, but not necessarily to attest to its
eccuracy’.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : John H. Waller
Inspector General

SUBJECT : Washington Star Story, 1 October 1976

1. This is for your information only.

2. On1 October 1976 the Washington Star published a.news
story with an Associated Press credit line, headlined CIA
Viewed Oswald As Information Source (copy aitached). The
lead stated:

Contrary to sworn testimony, the. CIA once con-~
sidered using presidential assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald as ‘a source of intelligence information
about the Soviet Union, according to a newly
released CIA document.

In sworn testimony before the Warren Commission,
former CIA Director Richard Helms said the
Agency never had "or even contemplated" any
contacts with Oswald.

The news story, in another section, made the following
statement:

The November 25, 1963, memo explained that
the Agency's interest in Oswald as a potential
intelligence source was due to his "unusual
behavior in the USSR, '! to which he had defected
in 1959.



bo GH Peed add

3. There was such a memorandum, written by a case
officer then stationed in Paris, recently released under FOIA.
Writing three days after President Kennedy's assassination,
this case officer recalled that there had been interest in Oswald,

As soon as I had heard Oswald's name, I recalled
that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed ~--
sometime in the summer of 1960 -- with the then
Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section
the laying on of interview (s) through KUJUMP or
other suitable channels...

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the
USSR had struck me from the moment I had read
the first ODACID dispatch on him, and J told my
subordinates something amounting to "Don't push
too hard to get the information we need, because
this individual looks odd," 7

+ « « » Ido not know what action developed there-
after. +o «

4, The Helms testimony before the Warren Commission
on this subject was.as follows:

Mr. Helms. On Mr. McCone's behalf, I had all

our records searched to see if there had been

any contacts at any time prior to President Kennedy's
assassination by anyone in the Central Intelligence
Agency with Lee Harvey Oswald. We checked our
card files and our personal files and all our records,

Now this check turned out to be negative. _ In addition
I got in touch with those officers who were in positions
of responsibility at the times in question to see if
anybody had any recollection of any contact having
even been suggested with this man. This also turned
out to be negative, so there is no material in the
Central Intelligence Agency, either in the records or
in the mind of any of the individuals, that there was
any contact had or even contemplated with him.



13-00000

a es

5. Mr. Helms did state exactly the words quoted in the
news story -- "or even contemplated,"' But the context of ,
those words was what was reported to him as the result of
a search of records and memories. To this day those
familiar with the extensive Oswald records state that there
is no reflection in those records that anyone even undertook
to propose or approve a contact with Oswald. It would have
been natural to do so, but apparently any such thoughts did
not progress to formal action. From the memorandum
quoted, it is apparent that someone at Branch level did think
about it, even if nothing ever came of it. This hardly con-
stitutes a responsible or official or serious "contemplation"
of the idea. Mr, Helms' full statement on this point seems
literally correct in the full context of his statement, although
more refined qualifications might have reiterated the basis
for his conclusions. The news story is misleading on this_
point.

6. -The news story statement that Oswald was considered
due to his "unusual behavior in the USSR," is exactly the
opposite of the statements of the quoted memorandum, which
reported the care that should be used if Oswald were approached,
because of his strange conduct.

7. The statement in the news story about Mr. Dulles
consulting with Agency personnel on how to answer questions
is basically true. The interpretation to be placed on this
counselling will depend on the interpreter. The inference of
the news story is that Mr. Dulles was counselling slanted
responses on the Oswald issue, thereby tending to reinforce
the interpretation of deception attributed to Mr. Helms.
