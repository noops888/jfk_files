CUBA
THE MOVEMENT OF SUBVERSIVES AND SUBVERSIVE TRAINEES

I. Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede
the flow of subversives between Cuba and other Latin
American countries. Execution of any one or more of
the enumerated actions will ameliorate the situation;
execution of them all will not completely solve it.
The practical problems involved are too numerous and.
complex. 2

With respect to diminishing legal travel to Cuba,

-we face multiple problems in the policies and attitudes 7

of those Latin American countries through which the
subversive traveller must pass. From. the viewpoint of
these nations the direct actions required have strong
political and sometimes legal implications - impli-
cations which cannot be overcome easily, even when

the leaders of these countries choose to do so.

In the matter of clandestine travel, :-we are 5
confronted not only with the great depth of communist
guile, born of two.generations of experience in the
international movement of subversives, but with the
inexperience, ineptitude and lack of awareness in
these same matters on the part of the Latin American
community.

In spite of this, the advantages do not all reside
with the communists. Cuba's insular character imposes
certain sharp limitations upon personal movement.

Cuba has no frontiers with other states; everyone
who enters the country must do so either by water,
or air, There can be no slipping through the
barbed wire,

SECRET

DocId: 32424042 Page 7


SECRET 7

On’ the other hand, this same geographic situation
makes clandestine entry and exit reasonably simple.
There are 3,825 linear miles of essentially unpa-
trolled Central American coastline, within 175 to
850. miles from Cuba, There are at least 93 airfields,
other than ours, within 700 miles of the island, and
the ships and craft indigenous to the Caribbean, and
capable of supporting the subversive ebb. and flow,
number well into the thousands,

Even in the face of these unfavorable factors, a
program of direct restraints, selected from among
the actions enumerated herein, can have favorable
effects. Under the proposed steps some travel would
be stopped completely. More - probably much more -
would be rendered difficult. Some hitherto legal
movement would be driven underground. Previous
clandestine movement would be’ impeded,- complicated
and-harassed t6 the point where it becomes more 5
costly, more uncertain, more ‘hazardous and thus;
hopefully, less extensive,

iI, Nature and Scope of the Problem

We do not know enough about the movement of
Subversive trainees, into Cuba’ and - more important =
out of Cuba. We do not know enough about thé. volume
of travel, or the media employed, This is par-
ticularly true in the area of illicit traffic, where
our knowledge is extremely limited.

Regarding legal travel to Cuba, CIA presents the
following estimate:

* In transit, including about 300 Mexicans

While some of these travellers proceeded to -Cuba-by
other routes, the great majority passed through Mexico,
On the most conservative basis, then, it will be seen
that there cannot have been fewer than 4,912 travellers
to Cuba during 1962, while the average monthly number
passing through Mexico for the first two months of:
1963 is even higher than the 1962 monthly average.

Of the total number visiting Cuba, the Central
Intelligence Agency estimates that at least 1,500, and

perhaps as many as 2,000;,;have received ideological
indoctrination or guerrilla warfare training. Many

of these are still in Cuba. Others have returned to
their homelands; some by legal means; some probably
“py illicit means, There is no reason to presume,
moreover, that the travel to Cuba of the remaining
3,000-3,500 was entirely consistent with the best
interests of the hemisphere,

Prior to the October crisis, Latin Americans
travelling to Cuba usually moved by regular commercial
airlines or, on occasion, by specially chartered ~
Cubana flights, Some travelled to Trinidad ‘or
Curacao and thence by regularly scheduled. Cubana or
KIM flights to Havana. Others travelled to Mexico,
and from there by Mexicana or Cubana commercial
flights to Havana, With the cessation of service
to Cuba by Pan American, KIM, Mexicana, and Iberia.
airlines in October, the regular Cubana service :
between Mexico City and Havana remained. the sole
direct. and regular airline connection between.Cuba.
and the remainder of: Latin America,

The Qubana service between Havana dnd.Mexico.is’
scheduled to operate twice weekly, but sometimes only
a single flight is completed per week, Aircraft now
employed are British Britannias-- an obsolescent model,
Cubana has requested, but has not yet received,
Mexican approval to substitute Soviet IL-18 transports
for the old Britannias. Delay by the Mexicans in
granting this approval can have the favorable effect
of impeding travel, as the Britannias are-now in
poor condition, If, in addition, the British and
Canadians can be induced to suspend delivery of:
spare parts, the planes will soon become inoperative,

Iberia airlines resumed its regular twice-monthly.
flights from Madrid to Havana on ll February. This
flight makes one stop, in the Azores, before reaching
Havana.

KIM has not yet resumed its regular flights to Cuba
from the Netherlands Antilles, However, it is now. con
sidering doing so. In this regard it is concluded. that. ;
resumption of scheduled flights by a United.States
earrier could serve as an encouragement to KIM and
others to do the same,

. Soviet and Czech airlines serving Cuba do not. stop
regularly at any other Latin American country, though
the Soviet Aeroflot line has occasionally sought and
received permission from Brazil to land at Recife,
enroute to Cuba, Some Latin Americans may have
travelled to Cuba on these infrequent flights and,
should Brazil-permit this arrangement to become
regularized, the movement of subversives could
achieve a new order of magnitude.

A Canadian non-scheduled, line has operated. a.few
flights from Canada to Havana and return, carrying
-both material and personnel, The Canadians have-been
unresponsive to our efforts to obtain identification
of the passengers.

. There are no regularly scheduled sea carriers
operating between Latin America and Cuba. ° However,
a number of trainees from British Guiana have
travelled to Cuba aboard unscheduled Cuban merchant
vessels engaged in transporting rice from Guiana to
Cuba,

Clandestine sources report that transit of Latin~
Americans through Mexico to Cuba often involves ‘illicit
-procedures, The Cuban embassy in Mexico City provides’
the. travellers, whom they identify as tourists, with
. special Cuban entry papers; no entry is made in their
passports, and they are given pseudonyms for travel
out of and into Mexico. This procedure is obviously’.
designed to impede any effort by the other Latin
American governments subsequently to identify the
travellers and to exercise surveillance over their
activities upon their return,

Evidence at hand portrays a substantial flow of
travel by legal means, This must be countered
directly. Beyond this, and perhaps of greater
importance, is the problem of illicit movement. both
into and out of Cuba, which will undoubtedly assume
growing proportions as legal travel is curtailed,
and about which our intelligence is at present most
limited, Elimination of this intelligence void must
be accorded“high priority.

III, The Attitudes of the Latin American Nations

Success of many of the overt actions proposed in
the sections to follow will turn upon the attitudes.
of the Latin American nations within whose borders
the restraining actions. must take place, Presented
briefly below is an estimate of what can be expected
from the various sectors of Latin America in terms
of participation in a coordinated program of travel,
control. :

As a general matter, the imposition of controls
on travel is not popular with the public in any Latin
American country. This, coupled with their current
lack of full awareness of the danger represented by
Cuba's training of subversives, will diminish the
willingness of some governments. to impose controls
unilaterally. This is especially true ‘since they
recognize that unilateral restraints will. have.little:
effect on curbing the travel of their nationals to
Cuba, if supporting multilateral action is not also
taken, It is likely, however, that most of. the
Latin American countries would respond favorably ---
albeit. in varying degrees -~ to US leadership in
seeking to reduce the flow of persons to Cuba. for
ideological or subversive training,

The Central American countries are more acutely

‘aware of the danger posed by Cuban-inspired sub-

version than is Iatin America at large, and can be.
expected to react favorably to proposals for re--':
ducing travel to Cuba which President Kennedy might
present at the San Jose Presidential meeting.
However, their ability to) carry out commitments which
they may make will be limited by domestic legal

and political considerations, as well as by their
countries' technical incompetence in such matters.

Since Mexico is currently the principal
hemisphere transit point for legal travel of sub-
versives to and from Cubal, its attitude is of great
importance. Mexico, to date, has taken several
significant steps with respect to travel between
Mexican cities and Cuba. |It has instituted close

surveillance over travellers, to include stamping
passports to evidence travel to Cuba. In addition,
the Mexicans now photograph, covertly, all persons
arriving from or departing for Cuba, and have given
tacit approval to suspension of Cuban service by
Compania Mexicana de Aviacion (CMA), These actions -
all suggest that Mexico might be induced to take even
further cooperative steps, particularly on an un-
publicized, bi-lateral basis, wherein the political
hazards -of taking a public OAS position are.not
involved. In this regard, the Central American a
Presidents would probably agree individually to seek.
the participation of President Lopez Mateos of: Mexico
in specific cooperative moves to restrict the flow.

of persons to Cuba through that country.

Peru now has regulations which:actually prohibit
travel to Cuba, but the regulations have engendered*
public resistance, and are not enforced. The
Dominican Republic prohibits such travel. »Haiti
has no established policy, but. passports and exit
permits are reportedly issued. only on the personal
approval of President Duvalier, Colombia’ could
legally impose restrictions by executive decree,
but has. shown no inclination to do so. Other
countries, such as Venezuela, Chile, and. the central
American nations, plead the existence of legal or
constitutional barriers which preclude the’ pro-
hibition of travel to Cuba, but thus far, they
have made little effort to’ remove these barriers,

Five Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile,
Uruguay, Mexico, and Bolivia) now maintain diplomatic
relations with Cuba. Brazil continues its drift: to
theleft and gives little evidence of modifying its
tolerant attitude toward the Castro government.
Chile, with a legal Communist Party, exercises no
restraints on travel to Cuba, either direct or
via third country. 7

The elimination of all legitimate passenger
service to Cuba from Latin America could be

achieved through invocation of the Rio Treaty, but it
is unlikely that the hemisphere countries would. agree
to:do so in the absence of some major crisis similar
to‘ that involving the Soviet missiles or a case of.
direct Cuban intervention in another Latin American
country. Nevertheless, a campaign on our part to
develop a full awareness of the danger represented
by the flow of Castro-trained subversives would

. probably create a growing willingness to take action
oriented in this direction. In this: connection,
however, it is concluded that resumption of regular
passenger service to Cuba by. United States companies *”
would render more difficult. our efforts to persuade
latin American and other. free world countries to oo og.
take a grave view of the situation, and to. partici- 5 that
pate in dynamic action. , ‘

Virtually, all the Latin American ‘countries would (' ir .s230800"
be. willing to move against Cuban-trained subversives
upon their return to home countries, once they ‘put’.
“their new training to use. The efforts: of these
nations will not be dramatically effective, however,™
since, in the area of internal security, -all-of..them”
suffer from deficiencies in technical.skill, training,
equipment and sometimes from a lack of’a. sense of.
urgency. The United States can provide.essential® = « »
leadership in eliminating all of thesedeficiencies..”

Iv. Actions Concerning Legitimate Travel

Listed below are specific actions contemplated to
impede legitimately executed travel, to and from Cuba.
Legitimate travel is characterized, for this purpose,
as travel on recognized. public carriers, openly
arranged and involving travel documents which are
presumed to be in proper order, Certain of the
actions, it will be noted, are partially in effect.
Others have been proposed to the OAS - wholly or ‘in
part -.by its Special Consultative Committee on
Security. 7

any other potential supplier that they cut off the
supply of spare parts for Cuba's Britannia aircraft.

(3) Conduet negotiations with the Netherlands, —
Mexico, Cafiada and Spain to persuade those countries.

in Latin American public information media discredit-
ing the Cuban training effort, exposing the hazard
which it holds for Latin American tranquility, and
discrediting persons who have undergone subversive
training, in order to discourage possible volunteers
and develop popular opposition to such.activities.,

3. Or anization of American States (OAS Actions

In view of the important political, psychological, 3
and, hopefully, material benefits: to be derived from
any success achieved through the OAS ‘in combatting
Cuban subversive activity, the following measures
should be undertaken by ‘the United States in that body
at times and under. circumstances which give regard to
the need to preserve hemispheric solidarity, and give.*
recognition to the fact that progress will probably
be slow... :

a. Pursue adoption by the OAS of a resolution’
calling upon all member states to sever diplomatic
relations with Cuba, thus impeding the travel of
subversives to Cuba by legal means, and at. the same
time, creating serious obstacles to other related
Cuban subversive activities.

governments of a program of steps, on both’ the
national and international levels, to control
travel by their nationals to Cuba, utilizing the
proposals in the. report by the Special Consultative
Committee on Security (scces) as well as the specific
recommendations set forth herein.

ec. Once the initial comprehensive program in
b, above is undertaken, utilize the appropriate
OAS bodies to follow up on implementation ‘through
such means as multilateral exchange of information,

DIRECT CONTROLS ON THE MOVEMENT OF FUNDS TO AND

WITHIN LATIN AMERICA

I. Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to recommend measures
which will impose direct controls upon the flow of funds
from Cuba to and within other Latin American countries.

We possess evidence that Cuba is providing financial
support. to subversive campaigns in other Latin American
countries, but the full dimensions of the problem, in
terms of amounts involved and methods used, are not
known. We need more information. The difficulty with
which this information is procured underscores the prob-
“lems of counter-measures, since funds can be transferred
‘internationally or acquired locally in many ways, all
difficult to detect and harder to prevent. While we
may be able to diminish the flow through some channels
and increase the difficulty of Castro's subversive
financial operations in others, we cannot hope to suc-
ceed in stopping them altogether, and even if this were
feasible, the possibility of financial support of
subversion by the USSR and other Bloc.nations would remain.

Nevertheless, it should not be concluded that
the impediments recommended herein are of insufficient
importance to warrant their imposition. Impediments
to the movement of funds can be imposed at relatively
little cost to the United States, and they will have
some effect in interfering with Castro's pursuit, through
subversion, of his basic objective of gaining communist
allies in Latin America. This effect could be very
significant when added to others that we hope to achieve
through our over-all anti-subversion program.

In examining this problem, it quickly became
evident that the most effective countermeasures are to

HW 50955 DocId:32424042 Page 26


SECRET

be found in the area of reducing the capability of

Cuba to acquire reserves of free world convertible
currencies, such as U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars,
Pounds Sterling, Swiss frances, etc. Cuban pesos are
usable only in Cuba. They are not convertible to-any
other currency and are therefore of little if any value
elsewhere in the world. Cuba's reserves of foreign
exchange, moreover, have been steadily diminishing

and are now estimated to stand at not more than $25
million to $50 million. If we are willing to intensify
our efforts to weaken the Cuban economy, these foreign
exchange reserves can be reduced further. However, it
must hotcbe overlooked that: the Soviet: Union can. provide
foreign exchange for Cuban use.

While of transcendent importance, this question
of diminishing Cuba's foreign exchange .through economic
measures is properly related to the larger objective of
weakening the economic position of Castro-Communist
Cuba, and thus advancing further toward the goal of
causing the downfall of the Communist government... As
progress is realized in this: broad endeavor,. there will
be a reduction in Castro's ability to finance subver-
sive operations in the Hemisphere.

The matter of intensifying our economic warfare
against Cuba is regarded, however, as beyond the
purview of this committee. Therefore, the program of
actions recommended in this paper has been directed
to the transfer of funds. This includes physical:
transfers, transfers through bank transactions and
transfers by subterfuge in connection.with trade. ~

Ir. Nature and Scope of the Problem
1. The Castro. regime may transfer. convertible
currency to subversives in other Latin American
countries by four general methods:

a. Introduction by hand, by legal or illegal
travellers.

b. Transfers through international banking

institutions.

SECRET 2

HW 50955 DocId:32424042 Page 27


SECRET

e. Introduction by Cuban or Bloc diplomatic
personnel, including couriers.

ad. The practice of subterfuge in connection with
international business transactions.

These methods are discussed in following paragraphs, along
with steps which might. be undertaken to. diminish the
effectiveness of each.

2. Introduction of Funds, by.Hand, by Individual
Travellers

This is the ledst convenient and least. dependable
method in terms of the hazard of theft, loss, misappropria-
tion, confiscation or extortion. Nevertheless; we:have
evidence that this technique is employed. Funds. can be
introduced by legal travellers, where there are ‘no effec-
tive controls, or they can be introduced by smuggling.
With respect to smuggled funds, it is noted that. the
measures previously approved for control of illegal

. travel will likewise be effective in impeding the illegal
moyerient of funds by such persons.. In like manner, the
measures previously approved for control of legal travel
will affect the movement of funds. by persons in.that
category.

Additional restrictions on the introduction of
funds by legal travellers might be adopted by Latin
American countries, in the form of limitations on amounts
or administrative requirements for declaration of sums
in hand. However, recommendation.on our part to
institute such controls would be contrary to our estab-
lished policy of encouraging the Latin American nations
to maintain free exchange systems. These countries
need foreign exchange, and would consequently be hesi-
tant to adopt any actions which would limit their means
of acquiring it. Additionally, the adoption of controls
on the importation of foreign.exchange by Latin American
nations would impose an undesirable. burden on legiti-
mate. business and other travel from the United States,
as well as from other friendly nations.

SECRET. 3

HW 50955 DocId:32424042 Page 28


SECRET

Thus, in the category of movement of funds by
travellers, it is concluded that little more should be 2
done at this time than is currently in motion.

3. Transfers through Banking Institutions

In addition to physical transfers of currency,
Cuba can transfer funds to subversives: in Latin America
through banking institutions, either by cable. or by mail.
Cuba's reserves of foreign exchange are held principally,
in the State Bank of Russia, the Moscow Narodny Bank in
London, the Banque Comerciale pour 1/Europe du Nord
(a Communist owned institution) in Paris, the. Bank Intra
of Switzerland, the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank
of Canada. Funds from these deposits. are transmitted
on order of the National Bank of Cuba, which controls’
all of the accounts.

U.S. dollars are the principal currency. used in
Latin America. The transfer of dollars from these
overseas accounts to subversives in Latin American
countries can be impeded, in a significant degree, through
the “institution by the United States of. blocking: controls
- against Cuba, under section 5(b) of the Trading with ‘the
Enemy Act. This blocking action would prohibit: all
transactions with Cuba by persons or. institutions sub=
ject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and
would effectively interrupt Cuban movement of U.S.
dollars to Latin America through any U.S, bank.

Movement by Cuba of dollars through banks of
third countries would also. be greatly diminished by this
action. It is known and generally accepted in inters
national banking circles, that it is standing U.S. policy
that any foreign bank. which transfers dollars through
U.S. banks in behalf of a blocked country is subject
to. having its own U.S. accounts blocked. Because of the
importance of U.S. banks in international trade, foreign
banks cannot afford such a restriction. This policy
has been effective in the past, having deterred foreign
banks, even those of Communist countries, from engaging
in dollar transactions on behalf of Communist, China,
which have. been blocked by the U.S. for over twelve
years.

SECRET 4

NW 50955 DocId:32424042 Page 29


NW 50955

SECRET

With U.S. dollar channels blocked, other, less
desirable, avenues would remain open to Cuba for bank
transfer of convertible currencies such as Sterling,
Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, etc. If the British
and Canadians could be persuaded to prohibit remit-
tances in their currencies in behalf of Cuba, the
latter's capability to move funds through banking
channels would be further curtailed, and transfers in
other curréncies, such as Swiss francs, would be
relatively easy to detect and monitor. While it is
unlikely that British and Canadian cooperation would be
forthcoming in this degree, these countries could still
make a valuable contribution to the campaign against
Castro-Communist subversion by providing intelligence
concerning major transactions in their currencies by
Cuba.

4. Transfers by Diplomatic Personnel

We know that convertible currencies have been
carried to Latin American countries illegally by
diplomatic representatives and couriers of both Cuba
and the Bloc countries, under the protection of their
diplomatic immunity. This form of transfer can be
diminished through the rupture of diplomatic relations
with Cuba by those countries in Latin America which
have not already taken such action. However, the
diplomatic facilities of other Bloc countries would
probably jremain available to Cuba in some Latin American
nations.

5. Transfers Through Trade Subterfuge

An effective method of disguising transfers of
funds for subversive purposes is to give such transfers _
the appearance of legitimate payments for items received
in trade. In one technique, goods may be sent to a
Cuban addressee by a subversive in the export-import
business in a Latin American country bearing an erroneous
invoice. A shipment having an actual value of $10,000
ean be invoiced and paid for at $12, 00q; thus achieving
a direct transfer of $2,000 from Cuba to the Latin
American country whence the shipment originated. Such

SECRET 5

DocId:32424042 Page 30


NW 50955

SECRET

transfers .of funds could be eliminated only by the
interruption of all trade between Cuba and other Latin
American countries. And even if this were achieved,
the same technique could be used, although at greater
cost and with much more difficulty, to transfer Cuban
funds to Latin America via France, for example, through
a third party French Communist import-export firm.

Another commercial technique for transferring
funds from Cuba directly to Latin America, through trade,
is by means of uncompensated exports: As an example, a
Cuban source might send $5,000 worth of Cuban publica-
tions to a leftist bookstore in Chile. The bookstore
would not pay Cuba for the publication, but instead
would use the proceeds of the sale for subversive pur- |
poses. This method also could be fully controlled
only by an. interruption of trade with Cuba.

6. Relative Importance of Transfer Methods

All of the above mechanisms are usable, and pror
‘bably all are employed now. However, since large. sums
can now be transferred readily through banking institutions,

- ‘with small risk of loss or exposure, this method is

considered to be the most significant and is deserving.
of the greatest attention in an action program. . Next
in importance probably is the transfer of currencies
by diplomatic personnel - a procedure involving small
risk of loss or exposure. Transfers by legal or
illegal travellers are considered to be less important
in view of the risks involved, the physical limitations
on amounts which can be carried by individuals and the
availability of other means. Trade subterfuge would
presently appear to be of least significance, since
such arrangements involve more difficulties than any
of the other available methods.

Tir. Actions Recommended

1. The actions proposed herein, when added to those
alneady proposed for controlling the movement of sub-

versive persons, propaganda and arms, will serve to
inhibit directly Cuba's effectiveness in financing sub-
version in. Latin America. It must be acknowledged how-
ever, that.Cuba's efforts to provide convertible currency
to subversives in other Latin American countries cannot
be rendered wholly ineffective by these measures alone.
.Complementary steps designed to reduce the ability of
Cuba to acquire foreign exchange will also. be raguired

to constitute a full attack on the problem.

2. The following actions are recommended as
promising to have some significant effect:

a. Establish regulations ‘blocking

(1) the unlicensed transfer of U.S. dollars
to Cuba;

(2) the unlicensed transfer of U.S. dollars
directly or indirectly from Cuban accounts to
free world countries; and

(3) all other unlicensed transactions
with Cuba or Cuban nationals, or transactions
involving property in which there is a Cuban
interest.

These actions should be taken only following the
development of detailed implementing instructions
by the State and Treasury Departments and their
final evaluation in light of other considerations
which bear on the matter.

b. Seek opportunities to pursuade Latin American
nations which have not.done so to.sever diplomatic
relations with Cuba.

c. Increase intelligence efforts to gain
information concerning:

(1) the size and location of Cuban accounts DoD
in free world banking institutions; SuPPoRT

MOVEMENT OF PROPAGANDA MATERIALS

:I, Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede
the movement of Communist propaganda materials from Cuba
to and within. Latin American countries. They: complement.
the basic actions relating to. control of movement. of; sub
versive. trainees to and from Cuba,..which actions are gen-
erally applicable.in the solution of this problem as. well.
As in the companion measures. for control. of. the movement.
of subversive trainees, successful execution of the ‘actio:
proposed below will .reduce.the flow of propaganda materials
put will not eliminate it entirely.

Communist Cuba has many legitimate. outlets theliehs
which prepaganda materials flow. As these legitimate -;
outlets are blocked. by the initial. steps herein:preposed,
it will be necessary for the Cuban propagandists ‘and thei
sympathizers élsewhere to turn from the mass exportation:
of materials to the production and dissemination of the
same materials in a clandéstine environment within the
several Latin American countries. -Of the: two-threats;.-the -'
illicit production of propaganda materials in each: ountry i
will be. by far the more difficult to abate. %

In combatting thesé threats, one of the most powert -
ful. factors is. the influence of our own information ‘and...
counter-propaganda efforts, which USIA and CIA have-in-
ereased greatly during. the past two years. -This paper,:
however, is concerned-wholly with. direct .actions;,. actions
designed to impede. the movement of propaganda materials™
to.and.within Latin America,

II. Nature and Scope of the Problem

While the. Castro image has faded somewhat.in-Latin:
America, and the attraction of Cuba as a model has.dimin-..
ished, the.susceptibility of the Latin American: people.to \:;.-
communist propaganda remains high. The basic. social.and..
economic factors which have made this true inthe. past. ad
have not greatly. altered, and the variety and quantity of.”
propaganda materials with which the Latin Americans are...’
now beset are impressive, as exemplified in the many.
millions of dollars which the communists are. estimated to
be investing in the project.annually. It is a large pro-~
gram and it presents a continuing threat to the tran-
quility of Latin America.

HW 50955 Docld:32424042 Page 36


HW 50955

SECRET

Our efforts to combat the problem, moreover, are
complicated by the fact that freedom of thought, express
ion and press are generally highly regarded in Latin
America, albeit not universally honored, and any proposals
to reduce the flow of Castro-Communist subversive materials
must. be influenced by this fact. Otherwise the United
States may find itself indicted for fostering police-
state methods, a charge which could alienate many of the
Latin Americans we seek to influence. : oh

For the purpose of this paper, propaganda materials.
include radio program scripts, tapes and recordings,. printed
materials, (posters, pamphlets, magazines, leaflets, books,
newspapers, news service output), motion pictures, dupli-
eating or reproducing equipment, electronic communications Sth.
equipment, and printing resources, particularly paper.-stock~
piles. BE ee

However, to be complete, “movement of. propaganda ;
materials" must extend also to publications whtéh are ‘hand-
carried into a country by legal or illegal travellers. for
subsequent reproduction. It must also include matertals.°”
transmitted through Cuban and Soviet Bloc diplomatic :
channels, shipments via postal channels, quantities.intro
duced through smuggling operations; oral transmission:of
propaganda guidance by. individual travellers or by Radio
Havana, and the dissemination of communist. oriented: news*
by Prensa Latina, the official Cuban news agency, for. re-
production by local outlets, Finally to be considered are:
thematic guidance, which can be reproduced and exploited:
locally by returning trainees, front groups and’ sympathetic:
publications and, in some countries such as. Mexico, Argen-
tina and Uruguay, the products of those commercial -estab-
lishments which regularly print or broadcast pro-Castro-
Communist materials as a matter of policy or ideological
conviction. ‘

Press and Publications

There are 326 Communist and pro-Communist newspapers
and periodicals in Latin America, and infiltration of :the,
democratic press, coupled with the non-critical attitudes
of some .newspapermen, increases greatly the diffusion of :
the Cuban propaganda line. There are 228 Communist-oriented
publishing houses and bookstores in Latin America, serving
as outlets not. only for 30 different Cuban periodicals, but.
for a large variety of other Communist printed material.

Every Latin American country except the. Dominican
Republic, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and Venezuela permits
these bookshops to operate. Many of them offer publi-
cations at very low prices or give away several books
with the purchase of one, and easy credit terms are
available.

Excluding TASS and the New China News Agency (NCNA),
Prensa Latina is the principal Communist news agency’ in
Tatin America. It.operates openly, although not entirely
without restriction, in-ten countries -- Bolivia, Brazil;--
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Costa, Rica, Honduras, -Mexico,
Panama and Uruguay. While most users of Prensa. Latina-® .. ac
releases are covert or overt Communists, Some non-Communist::
media make unattributed use of Prensa Latina releases.

This is-especially true of radio broadcasts,

: All of this. publication.activity. is essentially’:
overt. However, decrees banning Communist propaganda: ’,
have not prevented the clandestine. publications and dist ri
pution of periodicals and. books in some countries, and
propaganda materials continue to seek entry. through ‘the’
mails. In Panama, for.example, postal and customs authori- :
ties destroy an average of 12 tons of Cuban propaganda. per
month. Another.ten tons per-month. is seized and destroyed
in Costa Rica. This suggests the further quantities; per-
naps larger, may ‘be finding their way into these’ and “ouher
countries. i :

Radio ¥

Short wave radio is the principal direct’ mass - audience...
medium used by Cuba to carry subversive propaganda: to..Latin-«):
America. The Castro regime has.constantly.increased Radio :
Havana's short wave broadcasts to Latin America to.a current
level of 115:30 hours per week.

Cultural Activities

Penetration under the guise of cultural activities is.
a favored Communist propaganda technique in Latin America;
where there are now some 64 Cuban binational ‘centers and’,
Friendship: Societies.

Feature films and short documentaries produced ‘by the
Cuban Institute of Motion Picture Art and Industry play a
direct propaganda role. These films are shown primarily in

and in private or clandestine meetings.

It will be seen from this brief review.that.Latin
America is the target of a broad-scale. propaganda program,

DIRECT CONTROL OF THE MOVEMENT OF ARMS TO AND
" WITHIN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES

I. Introduction

There is presented herein an action program aimed
at controlling the movement of arms to and within Latin
American countries through inhibitions on movement of
arms, restraints on their sale, ownership and fabrication,
and controls over the movement of the critical components
which are essential to the local manufacture of weapons.

If success is to be achieved in reducing their use
for subversive purposes in Latin America, the term "arms"
cannot be limited to firearms in the narrow sense. In
addition, it must include explosives, fuzes, detonators
and demolition equipment; all the weapons of hand-to-
hand combat; grenades and mines; underwater demolition
equipment; lethal gases, chemicals and instruments
for their projection; undercarriages and transportable
appendages for automatic weapons, mortars and other
heavy weapons; spare parts, special tools and equipment
for maintenance of weapons; portable radar and fire
control equipment; special sabotage devices; and printed
instructional material. relating to any of the items
listed above, or relating to techniques for their em-
ployment in sabotage and demolition.

Il. Nature and Scope of the Problem

Our information regarding traffic in arms between
Cuba and the remainder of Latin America is extremely
limited. The Central Intelligence Agency and the
Defense Intelligence Agency both conelude that Cuba is
probably not now sending significant quantities of
weapons to Latin American insurgents. Rather the Cubans
appear thus far to have followed common guerrilla practice
in the matter of firearms supply, instructing the sub-
versive trainees who attend indoctrination in Cuba to
obtain weapons by theft in their own countries, or to
fabricate them locally, rather than to rely upon

Nevertheless, it would be imprudent to assume. that
the Castro government will not.or cannot export arms to
Latin America when to do so will serve its purposes.

The very large quantities of US arms furnished to pre-
Castro Cuban governments, those weapons collected from
the Cuban people in 1961, and the sizeable Bloc arms
shipments delivered to Cuba since that time, provide
the Castro regime with large stocks which are available
for transfer to subversives in other countries, should
a decision be made to do so, Moreover, Cuba has a con-
siderable air fleet and a large array of small craft,
These unite with Latin America's long, unguarded coasts,
numerous isolated landing fields and inadequate local
security forces, to make the threat of illicit arms
shipment a considerable one,

On the basis of these facts it is concluded that
the immediate problems with respect to arms movement
are twofold: ~— to prevent internal assembly of illegal
arms and their distribution in and between Latin American
countries, while at the same time improving our
capability ta impede the movement of arms to those
countries from Cuba.

It is to be noted that, with respect to a number
of Latin American countries, national policy decisions
are a precondition to many of the actions proposed
below. These countries:will have to find the resolution
to deal much more firmly with the general problem of
Castro-Communist subversive activities than they have
in the past if the proposed actions are to be effective.

III. Actions Concerning Legal Arms Movement

For the purpose of this paper, legal arms move-
ment is considered to be the movement of weapons and
other instruments of: violence or the special materials
from which they are made, resulting from overt orders
placed by Latin American governments or private groups,
and then subsequently shipped openly.

Many of the actions, which have previously been
approved with respect to controlling the movement of
subversive personnel, will have a direct application

are proposed courses of action contemplated specifically
to impede legitimate arms traffic to, within-and between
Latin American countries for subversive purposes.

1. Intelligence Actions

a. Intensify US intelligence efforts in each >
Latin American country to determine the final
recipients of legal arms purchases and, consistent
with our own intelligence requirements, make this
information available to the host government.

b. Monitor covertly, suspected sources of local n
weapons manufacture (machine shops, metal fabri-
cators, foundries). Report positive findings to
host government, where appropriate,

2. Political and Administrative Actions

a. Persuade each Latin American country to
confirm the accuracy of cargo manifests of all
ships and aircraft departing for or arriving
from Cuba, and to intensify formal inspection of
all cargo, regardless of country or origin, for
munitions materials.

b. Provide further US technical assistance to
Latin American countries to improve customs pro-
cedures and controls for ports, airfields and
border stations.

e. Through the US diplomatic mission in each
Latin American country, impress upon the appro-

CUBA
THE ORGANIZATION OF A CARIBBEAN SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

Is Introduction

On 8 March 1963 the President approved the estab-
lishment of a coordinated Caribbean sea surveillance
system involving:

a.. Continued close-in surveillance of Cuba
by U.S. forces.

b. A UsS, military alerting system, by which
intelligence of subversive movement will be
rapidly transmitted to the United States -American
Ambassadors to countries concerned, through in-
telligence centers at Caribbean Command and
Caribbean Sea Frontier Headquarters of the Atlantic
Command. (The feasibility and desirability of
establishing these intelligence centers is being
studied further, on a priority basis.)

ce, Seeking initiation of unilateral sur-.
veillance and interception efforts by each country
in its own territorial waters.

d. U.S. assistance in final interception in
territorial waters upon request of the country
concerned,

It is the purpose of this paper to present the
detailed actions required to put this decision into
practical effect, with emphasis particularly upon the
function of United States forces, and giving considera-
tion to the fact that the decision was addressed to
surveillance of surface movement only and not to the
surveillance of air activity.

It. Nature and Scope of the Problem

General Considerations

The thousands of ships and craft operating in
the Caribbean provide an excellent. means for
clandestine movement of personnel, arms, equip-
ment and propaganda materials from Cuba to the
other countries in the Caribbean, as well as

SECRET

HW 50955 DocId:32424042 Page 53


SECRET

between Caribbean countries. The. many miles

of essentially unguarded coastline in the

area enhance further the attractiveness of these
means of disseminating elements of the Castro-
Communist program. While our information on

the extent to which this procedure is now ex-
ploited is meager, there is little question that
it constitutes at least a potential danger, one
that we must be prepared to meet.

The Caribbean surveillance system envisaged
herein must have the capability to:

a. Detect, in Cuban or international waters,
suspicious ships, and small craft, and

b. Identify and track these ships and craft
in international waters, until they can be
apprehended and inspected in the territorial
waters of the state which is the intended
destination or, alternatively, to

ec. Detect, in territorial waters of a
Caribbean state, ships or craft bearing: sub-
versive cargo, and apprehend those vessels
prior to their escape into international
waters or into the territortal waters of
another state.

Development of a program to meet the above
problems will be sharply affected by the fact that
that Central American countries have only limited
capabilities to patrol their own coastal waters
by sea or air, Their intelligence capability is
small and their communications resources are meager.

Special Considerations

a. Detection and Identification

Detection of suspicious surface travel can
result from visual sighting by air or surface
eraft, radar contact or-radio intercept. It
may derive from observation only, or may re-
sult from intelligence.

The identification of those surface vessels
which are actually transporting subversive cargo
ean only be achieved by intercepting and

HW 50955 DocId:32424042 Page 54


SECRET

searching all suspicious subjects. In the
absence of a political decision permitting
such operations in the open sea, this must
be accomplished in territorial waters.of
friendly countries, and will prove a costly
and burdensome undertaking.

In any event, effective detection and
identification within the jurisdiction of a
friendly power, in the territorial waters or
ashore, will demand the coordinate use of
indigenous resources including naval forces,
air forces, military or paramilitary forces,
fishermen and the local populace. These re-
sources must be organized for rapid reaction
to warnings. of impending subversive activity.

b. Interception

Siespicious targets which have been detected
and identified in international waters, or
those upon which advance intelligence has
materialized, could be shadowed to the limit
of the capabilities of sea and air forces
available, and the movement reported. In
the absence of a political decision to auth-
orize visit and search on the high seas,
subsequent action on the high seas would be
confined to observation. In territorial
waters interception would be accomplished by
or with the consent of the country in whose
waters the interception occurs.

ce. Intelligence and Communications

The difficulties inherent in timely detection,
identification, and interception of craft bent
on subversive missions point up the need for
intelligence on prospective movements coupled
with adequate means for rapid interchange of
this information. The Department of Defense,
the Department of State and the Central Intelli-
gence Agency have taken action to improve U.S.
communication networks, but the systems of the
Latin American nations concerned are, in most
cases, unsatisfactory.

d. Command Arrangements

An uncomplicated cooperative system is
visualized, based on eaéh nation policing its

SECRET 3

HW 50955 DoclIda:32424042 Page 55


NW 50955

SECRET

own shoreline and adjacent waters, with. its
own surface and air forces, coupled with
agreements between neighboring countries to
provide mutual information and assistance.
An over-all command structure for the system
as a whole is neither required nor desirable.

e. Funding and Logistical Arrangements

The operation of a modest surveillance
system, as envisaged herein, would still
entail operations on a larger scale than
currently in force, with corresponding
additional costs to cover materiel and train-
ing for the Latin American participants.
These financial requirements should be ful-
filled over and above current programs, and
accomplished through existing channels,

III. Attitude of the Latin American Nations

Given support and encouragement by the U.S., it
is concluded that some of the countries bordering .the
Caribbean Sea would be willing to participate ina
coordinate surveillance effort. However, the intense
national pride and the sensitivity of the countries in-
volved makes it by no means certain that any will par-
ticipate to the precise degree or in the exact manner
considered most desirable by the U.S,

Inter-service rivalries, political considerations,
mistrust of the military by their executive branches,
and antagonisms between indigenous police and armed
forces will all tend to impede the program. However, the
proposals that follow will serve to diminish these impedi-
ments, and to establish goals not only for U.S. planning,
but for U.S. efforts to encourage the Latin American
participants as well.

Iv. Actions

To be effective the coordinated Caribbean Sur-
veillance system will require:

a. Multinational actions to reach agreement on
surveillance, and on the means to control it.

b. Unilateral and cooperative measures to detect,
identify, track and apprehend clandestine movements
of subversive personnel, arms and equipment.

SECRET 4

DocId: 32424042 Page 56


q SECRET

c. A mechanism which ensures the rapid assembly
and dissemination of the required information to
the responsible agencies of the countries concerned,
i.e., an alerting system.

a. Improved communications facilities in the
area.

These measures can only be effective if the partici-
pating Caribbean countries are willing to develop and
improve their. counterpart internal security capabilities.
Specifically, there is a requirement for additional
effort on their part in counterguerrilla training, police
operations, intelligence, and air and ground mobility.

Listed hereafter are specific actions designed to
fulfill the foregoing requirements.

a. Multinational Actions to Control the
Surveillance Effort

(1) Consult the Caribbean countries with a
view. to requesting the President of one of them
to invite ministers from the other countries,
as appropriate, to meet for the purpose of dis-
cussing implementation of a multinational
surveillance program. Arrange at this meeting
for the governments of the participating
nations, including the U.S., to issue a joint
declaration that the export by Cuba of subver-
sive personnel and material will call for all
to take the necessary measures to safeguard
the countries concerned.

(2) Encourage arrangements between Caribbean
states for mutual cooperation in coastal sur-
veillance.

(3) Make bilateral arrangements, as necessary,
with each participating nation as to the con-
ditions under which U.S. combatant forces may
enter the waters in which we recognize the par-
ticipating nation's territorial sovereignty.

CUBA

THE EXCHANGE OF INTELLIGENCE
CONCERNING COMMUNIST SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES

I. introduction

In combatting Castro-Communist subversion through-
out Latin America, there is a fundamental requirement
for’ intelligence -- a requirement which involves the
timely acquisition and processing of information as
well as its rapid dissemination, on a selective basis,
to countries concerned. While efforts are now being
made by CIA, AID, and the US Military Services to
improve Latin American intelligence systems, success
thus far has been limited, and much remains to be done.
It is not with this broad problem, however, that this
paper is primarily. concerned, but rather with the
narrower matter of the need for a stronger program of
exchanging essential information regarding Communist
subversion in Latin America among those who need to
know it.

Il. The Nature and Scope of the Problem

1. Limiting Factors

a, There are many inhibitions which tend to
discourage the exchange of intelligence on an
international basis, even among allies. National
privacy with regard to the inner workings of an
intelligence system must be preserved. Com-
pounding the problem further, where Latin America
is concerned, is the divisive influence of the
long history of rivalries, wars, jealousies and
disputes which have characterized relations among
the nations concerned. The wounds of past conflicts
among pairs and groupings of nations are not com-
pletely healed. There is lingering hostility
between Peru and Ecuador deriving from their
boundary war. Chile and Bolivia continue at
odds over the Rio Lauca and the question of
Bolivian access to the sea, and, even now,
Nicaraguan insurgents are harbored within the
borders of both Costa Rica and Honduras. It
could hardly be expected that these countries
would be eager to exchange intelligence on a full
and frank basis.

SECRET

NW 50955 DoclId:32424042 Page 63


SECRET

b. Beyond this, Latin America is not. a homo-
geneous entity in social, political, or economic
terms, and attitudes toward the Castro-Communist
subversive menace vary widely. A completely
unified approach toward exchange of intelligence
concerning this menace, therefore, cannot be
regarded as attainable.

ce. Additional impediments to intelligence ex-
change are the generally low level of competence
of most Latin American intelligence services, their
lack of rapid, secure means of communication, the
absence of adequate security systems, and the lack
of security consciousness. Deficiencies in
security safeguards must necessarily limit the
exchange of intelligence obtaine§, covertly by any
of the nations involved, and particularly the
United States, which has the most sophisticated
system and hence the greatest need for protection.

d. These defects promise to persist, since the
governments of some countries have little desire to
develop a competent career security service. There
is a fear that the existence of an efficient service
would constitute a threat to further activities of
members of the existing governments at such time
as they might find themselves out of power. More-
over, many Latin American intelligence services
tend to label as "subversives" those of their own
nationals resident in other countries who are
opposed to the existing government,

e. These realities all underscore the fact that
multilateral intelligence exchange must be
approached on a most circumscribed basis, It
should not be concluded, however, that nothing
of value can be accomplished multilaterally.

With proper definition, limiting the problem

of exchange to matters directly related to communist
subversive activities, such as the movement to and
from Cuba of subversives, the production and
movement of propaganda materials which threaten
internal stability, the movement of arms, and the
movement of funds, it should be practicable to
marshal a useful measure of cooperation. In
pursuing this effort, it will be important to

draw a sharp distinction between secret intelligence

SECRET

gained by covert means and information obtained

openly. The former involves the requirement to

protect national secrets both as to sources and

acquisition methods employed. The latter, which
can be.of great value, can be exchanged without

fear of compromtse.

2. Categories of Exchangeable Intelligence

The following describe generally the categories
of exchangeable matter, and exemplify the types of material
under each:

a. Travel information - Unevaluated information
devoted solely to rapid reporting of the movement
of individuals between Latin America and Cuba or
Soviet Bloc countries. Such reports can be
reduced to a few elements such as identification
of the individual, point of departure, date and
time of departure or arrival, destination, and
earrier, When presented in an abbreviated form
such information offers minimum security problems
with respect to “exchange with one or more countries.

: b. Intelligence information reports - Un-
evaluated information derived from clandestine
collection operations or confidential sources
reporting on plans and activities of Cuban or
communist connected subversive individuals or
groups; on movement of arms, propaganda and funds;

~6n shipping and air movements and on results of
surveillance efforts. Because continued receipt
of such information by the United States is dependent
on careful protection of sources and methods of
collection, the exchange of this information with
other countries must be carefully controlled by
the collecting department.

c. Intelligence reports and studies - Evaluated
intelligence in all of the above areas, prepared
by an appropriate element of the US government in
a form which is releaseable to other Latin American
countries.

d. Selected overt materials - Articles or news
stories drawn from press, periodical and other
overt publishers. Selected for maximum impact on

SECRET 3

NW 50955 Docld:32424042 Page 65


SECRET.

other countries particularly where such information is
not freely available to security services, as in the
ease of foreign broadcast.-reports.

3. Current Exchange Arrangements

a. At present there is little organized exchange of
intelligence among the Latin American nations. There
is a limited amout of informal exchange, often on a
pasis of personal relationships between government
ofdicials having a community of interest with respect
to a particular matter.

b. The Central Intelligence Agency has established
working liaison arrangements in those Latin American
countries where such relations have been considered to
be in the best interest of the United States, Most of
the intelligence concerning subversion in Latin America
available to the CIA is derived from covert operations
or through contacts with another intelligence or security
service, This inhibits the passing of such information
to agencies of a third country. There is, however, a
substantial amount of intelligence available from overt
or non-sensitive sources which can be provided to
other countri In 1962, CIA received information
reports from services with which liaison is main-
tained in Latin America and released reports to
recipients. Intelligencé items exchanged included
collated studies, weekly intelligence reviews, name
traces and travel reports.

ec. The U.S. Army, through its attaches, currently
has an informal arrangement involving bilateral ex-
changes .of intelligence with Argentina, Colombia,
Ecuador, Uruguay, Peru, Paraguay and Venezuela. . Infor-
mation provided by the Army has been concerned with
subversive personalities, communist infiltration,
weapons movements and related matters. Reciprocal in-
telligence received has been of small value. The Arny
also provides selected information on subversive acti-
vities to Brazil, Chile, Guatemala and Mexico, without
reciprocation. The Navy has established a Navy-to-Navy
program forthe exchange of intelligence among nine
South American navies and the U.S. Navy. The U.S.. Air
Force, through its attache system in Latin America, like-
wise has an exchange program. This is accomplished on
an informal basis and is bilateral in nature.

SECRET 4

HW 50955 DocId:32424042 Page 66


SECRET

d. Exchanges. of information are also effected
from time to time through channels of the Depart-
ment of State.

e. As yet, however, the program for the pro-
vision by United States agencies of information on
subversion to Latin American governments has not
been developed to an adequate degree. Since the
United States possesses the most extensive
acquisition capabilities, as well as the only
secure and reliable means of rapid communication
throughout Latin America (currently in process
of improvement), the development of an integrated
United States sytem for bilateral exchange offers
the greatest possibility of achieving the results
desired.

f, United States experience in the matter of
intelligence exchange in Latin America, and in
other areas of the world, has led to the conclusion
that bilateral arrangements are. more fruitful than
multilateral arrangements such as those established
within the framework of NATO, CENTO and SEATO,
Nevertheless, this experience has shown also that
multilateral arrangements can be of some use,
particularly in creating an awareness of the need
for intelligence exchange.

g. The concept of an exchange of information
among members of the OAS with regard to subversive
activities has been put forward at numerous Inter-
American meetings, but has not been implemented,
largely for the reasons set forth in Section II.1.
Under the Punta del Este decisions, the OAS members
were urged to cooperate in strengthening their
capacity to counteract threats or acts of aggression,
subversion or other dangers to peace and security.
The Council of the OAS is charged with maintaining
vigilance over Castro-Communist subversion, and
a "Special Consultative Committes ‘on Security (SCCS)"
is established to give technical advice on request
to governments and the Council on matters relating
to subversion. All American governments have been
asked to furnish information on Castro-Communist
activities to serve as the basis for studies and
recommendations by the Council of the OAS on how to

ui

SECRET

counteract them. Since the Punta del Este meeting,
the OAS has been making slow progress in the
countersubversion field, but there has as yet been
no significant exchange of intelligence throtwgh
its machinery.

h, The Inter-American Defense Board (IADB) has
also demonstrated an awareness of the need for
exchanging intelligence regarding communist sub-
version, Annex 4 of the General Military Plan
prepared by the IADB requests the American States to
report information to the Board and“to establish
agreements among themselves for exchanging infor-
mation of collective interest. The United States
has approved the General Military Plan, but similar
action has not been taken by all member countries.

i. This brief summary serves. to illustrate that
there is much room for expansion of bilateral
intelligence exchange arrangements among the Latin
American nations themselves, which is now minimal
at best, as well as a need to create an expanded
program for bildteral intelligence exchange :between
the United States and individual countries, and
finally, a requirement to develop the possibilities
of a multilateral approach within the recognized
limitations involved.

III, . Existing Programs

Enumerated below are the principal programs now in
progress. They are subject to continuing improvement,

1. Bllateral exchange of intelligence is now being
conducted by CIA, DOD and*bther.US agencies with their
Latin American counterparts in.instances where it has
been found possible to establish appropriate arrangements
for exchange of selected information consistent with
security requirements.

2. A study is currently underway to evaluate the
feasibility and desirability of establishing military
intelligence centers of the Caribbean Command and the
Caribbean Sea Frontier, Atlantic Command, for further
dissemination of intelligence as appropriate in con-
Junction with our Military Alerting System, for rapid
processing and dissemination with appropriate, of
intelligence on subversive activities directly to the
countries concerned through the US Ambassador.

3. Intelligence is being provided to the Caribbean
Command by CIA and other elements of the U.S. Embassies
in Latin America as well as to CIA Headquarters for further
dissemination as appropriate.

4, Various agencies of the U.S. Government are now
disseminating to Latin American governments unclassified studies
and reports and other: non-sensitive information concerning
Castro-Communist subversion.

5, U.S, Government communications ,systems throughout
Latin America are being expanded and improved upon on a
high priority basis.

6. Programs now exist under AID, CIA, and DOD for the
training and equipping of Latin American internal security
and intelligence services. Additional programs gould be
established in other countries where it is found to be.in
the best interests of the United States and acceptable
to the country concerned.

7. All information received by CIA concerning travel
to and from Cuba is put into a computer system capable
of producing lists of name, by country, by point of travel,
or sorted on various other bases.

Iv. New Actions Recommended

1. Reinforece:.the present procedures. for bilateral iv)
exchange of intelligence, as described in Section III.1. by pe ae
recommending an.Embassy intelligence committee to coordinate gfe
procedures for ensuring timeliness, completehess and freedom
from duplication or false confirmation in the bilateral exchange
with the host governments.

2. Encourage. Latin American countries to engage in poe Cv
bilateral exchanges of intelligence on Castro-Communist yet
subversive activities. S

3. Arrange for the electrical dissemination to
appropriate Latin American governments of daily summaries
of wa@bo broadcast material as monitored by the FBID of
CIAs

4. Make available to as many countries as security aaaae
permits, ®anitized results of the extensive travel coverage
obtained by the Central Intelligence Agency, already processed

i TRAINING OF LATIN AMERICANS. IN THE UNITED STATES

I. Introduction

The fact that 2,000 Latin Americans have recently
been indoctrinated in’ Communist ideology and subversive
techniques in Cuba is just cause for concern, and warrants
an energetic response. Our actions to frustrate .this
movement .are.already beginning to generate :momentun,,. but
it will be idle to conelude that currently. programmed i
impediments upon the movement of people, arms and propa-
ganda from Cuba, will diminish decisively the. strergth =
of Castro-Communist inspired subversion in Latin America.
While 1t-will be important, so long as the Castro regime:
survives, to remove the ability of Latin Americans to
travel to Cuba, it will be much more important to remove:
their desire to travel there in the first place. .:

The root causes of this desire are numerous, bute,
prominent among them are.the dissatisfaction of the young
people of Latin America, their impatient hope for. better
things and their curiosity about the world at large... The
younger generation of Latin Americans cannot be expected
to stand still. They demand rapid and revolutionary im-
provement and this is what communism promises. them, how-..
ever falsely. We are faced with the challenge, therefore,
of convincing the young and restive Latin. American student,
farmer or labor leader that the progress. he desires-can ures
best be achieved through the institutions.of a ‘free. society../~.
One of the best means of establishing this. conviction is Ned
to show him, at first hand, our own free society in atta)

This useful influence is at work now’ with the: Latin
American students who are receiving education and ‘train-
ing in the United States. This group - considerably
greater in number than those who visit Cuba.or the Bloc
countries - are underwritten by various agencies of the
United States government, private institutions, and, in
many cases, defray their own expenses. On balance, these
young people return to their countries with a keener un-
derstanding of what makes the United States function.
While their reaction may not always be completely favor-.
able, it must certainly be more accurate - and thus more
favorable ~ than any picture painted for them by the
Communists at home.

7 In any case in terms of the numbers of young Latin

7 Americans which we might reach in this endeavor, it is
evident that our opportunities are not now being fully
exploited. If our efforts can be given stronger direction
and intensified, there is reason to believe that we may
exert a powerful influence on the most impressionable - and
most important - sector of Latin American society, the
younger generation,

That is the purpose of this study - to examine those

U.S. sponsored training and education programs for Latin
Americans which are already in motion, with the objective
of determining what improvements can be made which would
_ increase our capability for countering subversion, -Atten-
tion has been.focussed particularly on subsidized training
in’ police, military and certain other fields, selected.on
a basis of their special significance in the confrontation
with Castro-Communist subversive activities.

It is recognized. that the much broader area’ of U.S.
secondary school and college level education for Latin™.)%...)
American students is also a most fruitful field, which” °”.
requires similar examination; however, that study is :
viewed as being conditioned upon. educational factors
which are beyond the scope of this paper. :

Another important field which is complementary -to..
training in the United States, is the broad variety ‘of’
in-country. programs, now being carried out by the Department
of State, Peace Corps, AID, USIA, the Armed Forces, private’:
and religious institutions, and civil educational ‘insti-
tutions, Through these, the Latin Ameri¢an is exposed at
home to U.S, citizens who are interested in his welfare,
in terms which provide a direct rub-off of our values:

While it cannot be divorced completely from in-country. 7
training this paper does not concern itself directly. with
that sector. It does, however, recognize the importance ~
of the in-country effort, and proposes to make use of

the U.S. presence in Latin American as a catalyst to
attract promising young people towards training in the
North, where they can see organized freedom in action and,
by gaining confidence in it, become its champions in their
own country,

II. Existing Programs
1. General

Approximately 15,000 Latin Americans, exelusive
of private business trainees, are instructed:.annually in
the United States: Of these, about 10,000 are engaged
in undergraduate or graduate studies, including more than
1,000 individuals who receive subsidies from the United
States or from their own governments, The remaining 5,000
‘Pecelve specialized instruction, or are brought to the oe

“U.S, for orientation tours. The U.S. Government’ provides’
its subsidies principally through the Military Assistance.
Program, the Agency. for International Development, and the
Department of State, Also the Inter-Agency Committee on
Youth Affairs is reviewing existing programs affecting
Latin American youth and studying the possibility.of
leadership training courses for them, :

2. Agency for International Development ‘Programs: *”:

During FY 1962, the Agency for International
Development: brought 1,594 Latin. Americans tothe United
States for. training, in age groups as follows: ae

at. a university or school, for undergraduate or graduate
degree work, -The remainder engaged in on-the-job or less
formal training, or attended courses apart from a degree
program, for periods yarying from three months to’a year.
Students received training in the following fields:

3. Military Assistance Programs

At the present time, 2,277 Latin American military.
students are receiving, or are programmed: to receive, train-
ing in the United States “under the Military Assistancé Pro-
gram. Courses vary in length from: two-week orientation™.*
tours to 83-wéek flying training courses. However, “the.”
majority of instruction is for periods of less than six*”
months, and is distributed in fields as follows: ©

4, In FY 1962, 1,869 persons from the othér American
Republics came to the United States under program of the .
Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of thé Depart-
ment of State. This number is broken down as: follows:"’

Students (Academic study, “338,

Teachers (6-12 months) : 277.

Professors/Research Scholars Bu
(1-2 semesters)

Leaders and Specialists 299
(1-6 months )

Educational Travel Grantees 871
(30 days)

The 338 Latin American students were for the
most part at the graduate level, studying for a full
academic year at universities in the United States.
Teachers participated in six-month programs of teacher
development in their special fields, or in teacher edu-
cation workshops in Puerto Rico, with a smaller number _
teaching for a full academic year in United States schools.
The 84 professors and research scholars were engaged in
teaching or research from one semester to a full academic
year, or participated in short-term seminars at U.S.
universities. Leaders and specialists in all important.
fields visited the United States: the former, for
periods of from 30 to 60 days for observation and ‘to
confer with colleagues in their specialties; the latter
for periods varying up to six months for practical study.

and on-the-job training in their special fields (commu-
nications media, community welfare work, etc.). . The
871 educational travel grantees, comprising approxi-
mately 45 per cent of the total number of Department

of State sponsored trainees in the United States con-
sisted largely of selected students and student leaders
from. Latin American universities, and some school
teachers, who participated individually or in groups in
short-term observation visits relating to their special
fields of interest.

5. Training in the Canal Zone

Additional Latin American personnel undergo
training in Panama Canal Zone schools of. the Caribbean
Command and at the Inter-American Police Academy,
operated by the Agency for International Dévelopment,
Additionally, the United States Navy and Coast Guard
are establishing a facility to instruct Latin: Americans
in coastal patrol craft operation and surveillance. Le
While this training does not take place in the United”.
States proper, the Latin American students involved are
nevertheless exposed to a school environment which is
based on U.S. values.

During the past year, the United States: Army
Caribbean School trained 1,200 Latin American officers:-
and.men, while the United States Air Force School for
Latin America trained 494 students. The newly. formed
Inter-American Police Academy graduated 90 Latin Ameri-
cans during the same period, and is expanding classes
to reach a planned annual rate of 360 in FY 1964,

6. Cost of Existing Programs

The FY 1963 AID, MAP and State Department pro-
grams provide $21.9 million for training a total of
5,165 Latin Americans in the United States. The per
capita cost of training under civilian programs of the
United States Government is approximately $5,000 for a
full academic year. Military per capita direct costs
average $3,200, with courses usually of less than one
year's duration, It is estimated that the per capita
costs for short courses (8-16 weeks), both civilian and
military, approximates $1,600.

SECRET

DocId: 32424042 Page 78

. In terms of dollars alone, and apart from the
many benefits received, it will be seen that training
is a relatively inexpensive endeavor. Furthermore, in
contemplating the cost of an intensified program, it is
significant that the enrollment in most schools and
training courses can usually be increased ~- in some
degree - without corresponding increases in overhead.

7. Difficulties Encountered in Filling Available
Military Quotas in the United States

The failure of Latin American countries to take ~
full advantage of military quotas offered has. been a
persistent problem. In 1962, for example, 15 per cent
of the quotas offered were unfilled. This. unfavorable
situation derives from many causes. During. the current
fiscal year 18 per cent of unfilled Army quotas have béen
due to inability to meet course pre-requisites; 22 per
eent because of lack of sufficient funds and 33 per-cent
‘because of political upheavals. The armed forces of the
average Latin American country are small, andthe. avail-
ability of qualified candidates who can be spared: for
extended periods of instruction abroad is’ thus limited.
The short periods of obligated service and. the lack-of a
professional non-commissioned officer corps also tends
to discourage the training of enlisted men in United
States schools, since there is an understandable lack -
of enthusiasm for spending. large sums from limited budgets
to train enlisted men who will remain in service only-a
brief time. Another significant deterrent 1s the per .
diem rates required by law to be paid by some countries
to service personnel sent outside their homeland. (In.
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Uruguay, the legal rates
for personnel serving abroad are too high to be support-
able by defense budgets, while in other countries, such
as Bolivia and. Paraguay, the standard rates are too low
to provide a reasonable living for students.

III, Groups Appropriate for Expanded Training Efforts

Three principal groups have been identified as
meriting special attention in our program of impeding
the growth of Castro-Communist. subversion, . These are:

SECRET

HW 50955 DocId:32424042 Page 79

SECRET

a. Groups directly responsible for the security
of the country. Personnel of police, paramilitary

and military organizations should receive particu-
lar attention, with emphasis on junior and inter-

mediate level personnel involved in administrative
and supervisory functions.

be. Groups responsible for the operation of vital
facilities, Communications systems, public infor-
mation media, utilities, transportation and, in
some countries, industrial installations are vital
to the orderly functioning of a state. As a result,
they are prime targets for Communist infiltration
and subversion, U.S,-oriented personnel in these
occupations, especially at the lower supervisory
levels, are in a good position to detect, report
on and impede Communist activities.

Ce groups involved in direct supervisory con-:.”
tact w € younger. generation. Labor leaders;
teachers, athletic instructors, farm advisors,
student leaders, and technical school instructors
all work directly with young people, and thus
play an important role in. molding their atti-
tudes.

Tv. Actions Recommended

The training actions enumerated’ below are recom-
mended as. promising a useful return in our effort to
develop’ a stronger base of countersubversive convic+
tion among the groups identified in the preceding para+
graph. In execution of these actions, priorities should
be established in terms of individual country needs,

While the many variables involved render precise
calculation difficult, it is estimated that a vigorous
pursuit of all of the proposed actions would result in
an increase of directly subsidized U.S, training by
about 60%, or 3,600 people;.at an increased expenditure
of roughly $12,000,000, The financial support involved ;
should be provided over and above existing agency pro-
grams.
