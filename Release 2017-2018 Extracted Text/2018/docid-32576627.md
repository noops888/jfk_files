LV 92-625

INFORMANTS:

LV T-1 is LA 4335-C-TE. Information furnished to
Los Angeles agents 1/25/65 and 4/28/65.
: 7

LV T-2 is CV 421-C-TE to Cleveland agents.
ADMINISTRATIVE DATA:

By separate communication the Los Angeles Office
has been requested to furnish the New York Office with proper
characterization of LA 4335-C-TE to be used in compilation of
summary report.

It is noted that a separate file has been opened in
Las Vegas to attempt to identify ARMIN (LNU) described as
possible La Cost Nostra member.

It has been previously reported that FRANK INELLE,
Aka_ Buster, who is employed as bar manager at the Tropiciya
Hotel was a suspected member. Investigation has failed to
support this allegation and in interviews denies association
with La Cosa Nostra. CUTINELLE is "semi-cooperative" and has
furnished some information of value regarding other persons.
