LV 92-625

INFORMANTS:

LV T-1 is LA 4335-C-TE.

Information furnished to

Los Angeles agents 1/25/65

and 4/28/65.

LV T-2 is CV 421-C-TE to Cleveland agents.

ADMINISTRATIVE DATA:

By separate communication the Los Angeles Office

has been requested to furnish the New York Office with proper

characterization of LA 4335-C-TE to be used in compilation of

summary report.

It is noted that a separate file has been opened in

Las Vegas to attempt to identify ARMIN (LNU) described as

possible La Cost Nostra member.

It has been previously reported that FRANK AM GUTINELLE,

Aka Buster, who is employed as bar manager at the Tropicana

was a suspected member.

Investigation has failed to

support this allegation and in interviews denies association

with La Cosa Nostra.

CUTINELLE is "semi-cooperative" and has

furnished some information of value regarding other persons.
