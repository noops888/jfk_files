SWIFT stated CHRISTINE and PHYLLIS are "persona non grata!!

at DOROTHY's residence in Canada but the girls' act is

not going to disband and they plan a return to public

life with a television engagement on the JIMMY DEAN show

emanating out of New York City.

This show will be in mid-

October, 1963, and they then will be

working steadily at

various places throughout the country. u

SWIFT stated CHRIS is very upset because her son

is a complete delinquent who has spent a year in jail and

IS

incorrigible. SWIFT stated CHRIS has no contact with her son

at this time. He stated CHRIS' ex-husband, JOHN TEETER, öf

New York City, is very bitter at CHRIS and will do anything

to embarrass her. U

SWIFT stated as far as GIANCANA's liaison with

PHYLLIS is concerned, she is as much responsible for it as

SAM. He stated

the reason they are not married is because

both cannot agree to it at the same time. When one wants

to, the other does not. He stated GIANCANA is not dependent

on PHYLLIS as he has had a long succession of beautiful women

in the past and he (SWIFT) thinks that SAM could easily

shift his affections to somebody other than PHYLLIS if the

fancy struck him.U

He stated GIANCANA never mentions any business

activities in front of him and alludes to his gangster

connections only in humorous fashion and offers no worthwhile

information.

He stated he does know GIANCANA is very close

to FRANK SINATRA

SWIFT stated he does not want to be in a position

of having to call the FBI to furnish information as is

available when GIANCANA

comes but will always answer any

questions the FBI puts to him.

He said GIANCANA told him the

FBI would probably contact him (SWIFT) and GIANÇANA advised

him that he could say anything he wanted as he knew nothing

incriminating about GIANCANA.

LEAD:

MIAMI:

Miami will maintain contact with SWIFT to maintain

the present liaison and attempts will be continued to further

develop it. Y
