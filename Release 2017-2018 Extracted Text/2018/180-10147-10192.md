in Miami that the

that the three-man tram

was

prepared to dispitch

In December,

acted on behalf of G.ancana and the CIA.

(18) the violation of the wiretap statuteplaced

the case under feder il jurisdiction and the FBI soon

began an investigatin. In the course of this

investigation, Maheu informed the FBI that he

instituted the surve llance on behalf of CIA efforts

to obtain Cuban inte ligence through the hoodlum

element, including G.ancana.

In its efforts to

prevent the prosecut on of Balletti, Maheu, and an

who had alleged y asswill Balletle in thi wiretap,

that a few days prior to /5-9-62/ he had been

with a proposition ›f paying $150,000 to hire

gunmen to go into Ciba and kill Castro.

He

further stated CIA idmitted having assisted Maheu

in making'the

"bugg.ng" installation in Las Vegas

which uncovered thi; clandestine operation and for

this reason CIA could not afford

to have any action

taken against Giancina or Maheu.

Mr. Kennedy stated

that upon learning

'IA had not cleared its

action

• in hiring Maheu and Giancana with the Department of

Justice, he issued orders that the CIA should never

again take such stes without first checking

with the Department of Justice.

Mr. Kennedy further advised that because of this

matter it would be very difficult to initiate anv...

prosecution against Giancana, as Giancana could

immediately bring out the fact the United States

E. Debut of the Retaliation Theory

23) The genesis of this theory can be attributed

to an interview that Premier Castro held on

September 7, 1963, wish Associated Press reporter

Daniel Harker. In trat interview, Castro-warned

against the United States "ai

ding terrorist plane

to eliminate Cuban leaders.

He stated, according

to Harker, that United States leaders would be in danger

if they promoted any attempt to eliminate the leaders

46)0(24)

of Cuba.

early January,

19 Zaward Morgan approached columnist

Drew Pearson, relatel the background of the plots,

posed the possibility that the plots could have provoked

a Castro retaliation and asked Pearson

inform

44 (no No. 73)

Chief Justice Earl Warren of the operation.

Warren subsequently

informed Secret serviceo birector

James J. Bawtey who in turn notified the FBI.

Morgan

informed the Committze that Roselli initially approached

him complaining

of excessive FBI surveillance ever

49-16

since he had been involved in this patriotic venture.

Roselli also informed Morgan that Castro had retaliated

for these plots by assassinating President Kennedy:

(25, Aiter receivi.ig this information the FBI

decided not to furthir investigate the allegation.

Following the publicition of the Jack Anderson

and Drew Pearson art cles of March 3 and 7, 1967,

however, where the teory of

retaliation first

gained public notority, President Johnson ordered

the FBI to investiga e the matter.

E2 48 The FBI

consequently intervi wed Edward Morgan on March 20,

1967.

Morgan info med

the FBI that he represented

clients that were re isonable individuals who entered

into a project that hey understood to have high

governmental backing and which involved the assassina-

54 50

tion of Fidel Castro.

Morgan then stated that his

clients had reason t, suspect that Castro learned

of these plots and k lled President Kennedy in

.5755

retaliation.

(26) The FBI inves igation resulted in President

Johnson acquiring

a ersonal interest in the

retaliation theory, wich prompted CIA Director Richard

Helms to prepare a riport on the assassination plots.

This report detailed

the accounts of various CIAloperations against Costu

including an analysi; of the CIA-Organized Crime

plots and the AMLASH operation. The IGR also

examined the 1960 La; Vegas wiretap incident.

(28): In reference

=o the AMLASH operation, the

IGR related AMLASH's activities in Madrid, Spain

in late 1964 and early 1965, where AMLASH was meeting

with Manuel Artime.

The IGR further noted that

Trafficante, was in

Bongo claimed to be in contact with dissident Cuban

The Senate Selec: Committee To Study

Governmental Ope ations with Respect to

Intelligence Act vities

(3:)

In connection with its mandate to investigate

the full range of go ernmental intelligence activities,

the SSC "examined the performance of the intelligence

agencies

in conductig their investigation of the

assassination and thir relationship to the warren

Commission."

In April, 1976, the SSC published.

its Final Report (Bos V), which in essence, faulted

the CIA for its errors of omission in not informing

the Warren Commission of the CIA's on-going plots

against t

sen the life of the premier, Fidel Castro:

31) After reviewing the details of the CIA-Mafia

plots, the SSC stated that "Castro probably would .

not have been certain that the CIA was behind the

underworld attempts" and that it would have been

unlikely that Castrc would have distinguished the

the CIA plots with the underworld from any plots

(33)

The SSC ident fied the AMLASH operation,

however, as being "c early different" from the under-

66 635

world plots.

TheiSC stated that AMLASH was in

progress at the time of the assassination, that it

could clearly be traied to the CIA, and that AMLASH'S

proposal. for a coup lad been endorsed by the Cit se

the initial step beig the assassination of Castro.

The SSC cautioned, however, that it saw "no evidence

that Fidel Castro or others in the Cuban government

plotted President Keinedy's assassination in retaliation

for U. S. operations against Cuba."

(34) As related in the Introduction to this material,

the SSC did not react any conclusion because it

believed additional nvestigation needed to occur.

Roselli, was operatiig as an agent of the CIA.

(81) The weight of the evidence indicates that

Roselli, and thus Gi incana and Trafficante, knew

the CIA was behind tie assassination plots at an

early stage. This r cognition of CIA initiation

is important, bliss it shows that Giancana and

Trafficante and thus organized crime knowingly

became involved with the CIA.

(98) Although the GR does recast that Trafficante

was not involved in Phase II, lolit contains this

caution:

Trafficante wis one of the principals

in Shef Edwar is Phase One of the operation.

He presumably was not involved in Phase Two

under Harvey,

but we cannot be sure of that.

After all, Tr. fficante was the man who brought

-Verana into thie operation late in Phase One,

and Verona wa:: one of the main players during

Phase Two. 170

It is reasonable to assume that Roselli at least kept

both Giancana and Tafficante informed of the

operation's progres:.

of the plot to assa: sinate Castro. 173

Anderson's

column of January l!; 1971, which fixes the date of the

passage of the poison at the Fontainbleu as March 13,

In any event, it appears sertain that the CIA

did not pass any pils, poison, or assassination

weapons before February of 1961.

The

(165) To suppor. the description of Trafficante

as a courier, the dAy IGR states that "/A/t that time

the gambling casino: were still operating in Cuba,

and Trafficante was making regular trips between

Miami and Havana on syndicate business."

40b)

The Committee has obtained some evidence

which indicates tha. Trafficante was not travelling

to Cuba during this period. No records available to

the Committee from

NS, State Department, or the FBI

reflect any travels after February, 1960. During this

time, the FBI maint ined physical surveillance on

Trafficante. Tra ficante testified before the

Committee that he oily made two trips to Cuba after

his release from th: Irescornia prison, in August, 1959,

and that these trip; occurred within two to three

months of this rele ise. inaditionally. considering

Trafficante's reputid top position in the La Cosa

Nostra, it seems moe reasonable that Trafficante would

send a representati re to Cuba to conduct any business

rather than risk be.ng detained by Castro again.

between Miami and Hivana, the implications are

the thesis that the CIA found itself. involved in

providing additiona. resources for independent

operation that the cyndicate already had commenced.

(115) According to he tia IGR, the entrance of

Giancana and Rosell occurred during the week of

September 25, 1960. 18 In contrast, the SSC did not

assign a precise dae for their entrance because of

conflicting evidenc: between the fogy IGR and Maheu's

Senate testimony wh.ch set the date after November, 1960.

The SSC did conclud:, however, that Giancana was involved

in the operation du:ing October because of the Las

Vegas wiretap incid int which occurred on October 30,

and because of the Ictober 18, 1960 FBI memorandum

Inett revealed Gian :ana had tola several people of

25108

his involvement in 1 plot to assassinate Castro.

(116) Although thes : two events

which the SCC cites

may support the invlvement of Giancana during

October, they also invite speculation of independent

organized crime operations. The October 18, 1960,

FBI memorandum is particularly applicable.

'pill' in some

Since-according to the 1907 for the poison pills,

which the CIA prepa 'ed at Giancana's request, were not

ready for delivery, intil late February, or early

March, 1961, it is transty doubtful that Giancana's

November, 1960, ass issination plot was part of the

CIA operation.

Rat ler, it appears that organized

crime already had i:s poison plan in progress, using

a mistress of Castr, to accomplish the deed, when the.

CIA(fortuitouslyJen ered the scene.. Organized

crime then occupied a perfect position. it their

private plot succee led, they then would possess

far-reaching blackmil potential against the CIA

which they could exircise at an opportune moment;

if their intrigue filed, however, they could then

(5) what is puzzling is the introduction of a

sensitive and covert CIA operation without any

apparent attempt by the CIA to check his background

or ascertain his icentity. It seems extraordinary

that the CIA would propel the plots forward without

performing any sec rity check. . Indeed, it seems

more logical that it least Roselli and Harvey did

ascertain the identity of Maceo and for whatever

reason decided to vithhold this information. Further,

although the!

more probable that trafficante, who had recruited

(156) A related issie is whether "phases" actually

of the CIA Richard Bissell discuised smea

tess, stating that he

had come

to feel

that the threat of blackmail by the

underworld

figures involved had constituted the single greatest danger in the

plots. 219

Bissell, as Deput, Director for Plans, had been

personally involved in the plannung and authorization of the CIA-

Mafia plots in 1960-1961.230 Bissell had not been

interviewed

by the Inspector General's Offic: during their 1967 investigation

of the plots, and thus his recol ections and views were not contained

in the Inspector General's Repor 2 /

(165)

Bissell told the Committee that he believes he and other..

Agency officials should have bee, more cognizant of the possibility

of blackmail by the organized cr.me

figures involved in the plots. 2J2

Bissell stated, "We

didn't give

it sufficient attention at that

time. It was unwise. We only thoight of the possibility of black-

mail later." DeS

The former eputy Director recalled that

the

CIA's main fear at the time had eer "some sort of unfavorable

publicity, if by chance it leakel out," rather than the potential

ramifications of entering into sich a

powerful criminal figures. O2U

Bissell went on to state, "I

knew it was serious. I knew these were Mafia leaders., And I knew

they were in a position to make very damaging revelations about

the Agency. But we thought it was all

under control." 225

(166) While Bissell stated that le and his colleagues had not

realized the potential for blackrail when they first enlisted

Mafia leaders in the assassination plots, the CIA officer who

later

assumed control over the continuing plots has stated he

was well aware of - and

fearful ibout - such a possibility. 226

William Harvey, the clandestine ervices agent who coordinated the

reactivation and continuation of the plots in 1962 and 1963,

testified in 1975 that he and thin Deputy Director Richard Helms

had concealed the existence of tle assassination plots

from CIA

Director John McCone partly out «f concern over the potential

for such blackmail. In his Senat: Testimony, Harvey stated that he

and Richard. Helms decided not to inform McCone about the plots:

self-protection or aggrand zement, which,

as. it turned out,

lid not happen,

but at

tha: time was a very pregnant

possibility. /

(1651)

Upon learning partial detals of the plots, both Attorney

General Robert F. Kennedy and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had

immediately recognized the distu bing leverage the participants

in the plots had gained through their involvement with the CIA in

the murder attempts. As noted earlier, Attorney General Kennedy

was partially briefed about the re-Bay of Pigs assassination attempts,

authorized during the Eisenhower Administration em May, C

1962. 00p

Upon being informed of the plots, Kennedy had

met with FBI Director

Hoover to share the information and to voice his anger over the

CIA's actions. 224

In memc randum of their conversation

prepared

on May 10, 1962, Hoover stated that Kennedy had angrily noted that

the CIA's use of these

figures lad resulted in the possibility that

NG 17055

DocId:32273547

"the CIA was in a position where it could not afford to have

any action taken against Giancans and Maheu." 230 Hoover further

noted that he had been greatly disturbed over the Agency's use

of these individuals,

stating, "I expressed great astonishment

at this

in view of

the bad reputation of Maheu..

• The Attorney

General shared the

same views.", 23/

(165)

In his interview with the committee, former Deputy Director

Richard Bissell stated that he hid been distressed over reports

that. CIA Director John McCone hal never been

told about the Agency-

Mafia assassination plots during the period in which they were

occurring. 232 Mccone had bee, appointed Director of the Agency

by President Kennedy in. November of 196l/ thus serving as head of

the CIA during the last 15 months in which the plots

were continuing.

233 In his Senate testimony in 1975, Richard Helms who served as

McCone's Deputy Director during the period in which the plots were

continuing): stated that he could not recall telling McCone of the

existence of the plots while they were occurring.

2.34

Helms went

on to state that he "was trying to scratch my head as to why I

didn't tell him at the time and ny surmises are the best I can :

come up with. I am really surprised I did not discuss it with him

at the time." Q35" Mecone's former Executive Assistant, walter

Elder, told the Senate that McCone had once notified Deputy Director

Helms. that "assassination. could not be condoned and would not be

approved," and that the Agency.

was never to become involved in such

activity. 236 In his senate tastimony, William Harvey stated that

Director McCone had once personally told him that the Agency and

U.S. government must

not engage in such plots against any foreign

leader, and

further, that "if I got myself involved in something

like

this, I might end up gettiry myself excommunicated." >3?

As noted

earlier, Harvey went or

to testify that he and Helms had

withheld their knowledge of (anc personal involvement in) the murder

plots from Director McCone, partly out of fear "of this government

being blackmailed

... by figures in organized crime ..

Speaking of the failure of Hetms, Harvey, and other Agency

personnel to inform Director McCone of the plots, former Deputy

Director Bissell told the Committee, "The Director should have

informed. This was bad, anc shouldn't have gone on."' 239

Bissell, who. left the Agency in January 1962, stated, "The Director

should know if his subordinates - his top subordinates - are in a

position of being subject to blackmail or are in fact being blackmailed

¡by Mafia figures or anyone else. This is very bad." Q40

Bissell

commented that "in something that sensitive, involving national

security, you shouldn't have that potential of blackmail going

unknown to the Director." ati

(175) sissell told the Committee that he would not have become

involved in the early plots without then Director Allen Dulles'

personal authorization, stating, "If Dulles told me not to become

involved in such-a thing, I knon for sure I wouldn't. You can't

disobey the Director. " Of Steaking of Director McCone's

reported notification of both Richard Helms and William Harvey

that the Agency must not become involved in assassination activity,

Bissell stated, "I cannot say wiat McCone's reaction would have

been if he found out about such a violation of his wishes at the

time. I do know that Helms would have been in a most uncomfortable

position, but. I can't speculate." @43 The former Agency official

stated, "It's wrong. Obviously senior officials should follow

directions, especially on somett ing like that. " @44 Bissell

further commented, "If McCone told Helms and Harvey not to get

involved, then it raises obvious questions about their actions •

I would rather not speculate abrut this. I don't know who gave

what orders to whom after I left. " 245

(1) .

Speaking of the CIA's wittholding of all information pertaining

to the existence of the CIA-underworld

assassination plots from

the Warren Commission, Bissell: tated that the Agency probably "didn't

think it was relevant I would giess." 246 Bissell further stated,

"I can't believe the potential ‹ oncern over blackmail by the Mafia

people would have been allowed ly the Agency to serve as a reason

for shielding the existence" of the plots from the Presidential

commission. d17 However

Biss ill added, "I guess you couldn't

absolutely rule out such a possisility."

248

(7) noked if he believed that the agency would have informed

the Warren Commission of the CIA plots if there had been substantive

news reports at the time linking Santos Trafficante, Sam Giancana,

or other organized crime leaders to the assassination of President

Kennedy, Bissell stated, "I can': speculate what

it would have

done. I would hope so." 344 Bissell went on to state that he

• believes that if the Agency actully suspected such Mafia involvement

in the President's murder, it wo ild probably have informed the

assassination, it would have inf rmed the Warren Commission of the

Ibid. at 69.. The 1967 Inspector General's Report took note

of the leverage that those

involved in the murder plots had

attained as a result of their association with the CIA. In one

section of the Report (pages 128-129) titled, "Should we try

to silence those who are talking or might later?" (emphasis

theirs) the Inspector General's Office noted that one or more

of the conspirators, most likely John Roselli, was then leaking

information about the plots to newsmen Drew Pearson and Jack

Anderson. The Report discussed the possibility that Agency

pressure could be brought to bear on Roselli

and the others to

preserve the secrecy of the past assassination plots. The Report

went on to note that,

"None of them would have compunctions

about dragging in his CIA connection when he was being pushed

by law enforcement authorities."
