Ambassador Thompson Then naked if XOSENKO had

We'later qualified the statement on Americans,

pointing

out that NOSENKO did provide information on d len

Anericans of lessor rink is well is private citizens.

The DDp then noted that aftor we roached a

point of no return in our interrogation:

• we might decide

haL NOSENKO would have to le

turned. back. Ambassador

Thompson oxpressed concern that the soviets might use tlis

action to discourage defections.

se explained

that when we

came co the point

that i turn-back appeared dosirable, c

Hould hope that a statement could be made by the U:S. Covern-

mont which would establish dostalo as a provocateur. The

ench described the AJOYFUl, case in brief terms to

Ambassador Thompson, emphasizing the parallel planning and

the possibility that i quadripartite statement by the govern-

nents might be

mails.

The bhy did note, however, that

and that they have the major

responsibility even though ve and other security ind intelli-

menco services had agroed on the handling of the casc.

DDP thon noted that in past cases where we had turned back

people with intelligence backgrounds at their own request,

the soviets had not made publicity capital of these actions.

The carlier montion of our discussions with the

PRE

recalled to Ambassador Thompson come of tlic material on

soviet political issues which he has been recciving recontly

from the fBI.

Ile

commented that jt was his very strong im-

pression that the information was being fed to us by the

Soviets.

He said that it cither consisted of information

we already knew or that which the soviets would not object

to our having.

He asked our views on this.
