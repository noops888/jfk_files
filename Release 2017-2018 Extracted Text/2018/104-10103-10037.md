MEMORANDUM FOR: OPS/RMO

SUBJECT

: Watergate File Research - Final Report

1. The files of the immediate office of the Chief, OPS/OSG

have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this

memorandum. The check included chronological files of communi-

cations of which. I was the author while assigned toll

in the period July 1970 to July 1973. Nothing pertinent was found.

2. I have attempted to recollect any other details which

conceivably could be pertinent and which relate to the perjod

of my assignment to

The only points which I recall but

on which I have no documentation are these:

by American residents of

about the reported presence

in Spain of E. Howard Hunt in 1972.

My standard reply was

at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never known during

having tried to contact any Station personnel inf

the period 1970-73. I made no effort personally to ascertain

whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by

any Station member.

D. A station officer, possibly

nOw

ssigned to

was given some information by an

informant in 1972 concerning reported activities in Spai

by Robert Vesco. I suggested that the information be given

informally to the Embassy's Economic Section chief, John

Oliver.

That officer was charged with keeping abreast of

developments related to Vesco.

The Station did not pursue

that subject, as I recall, because it was not a topic of

reportable interest, according to requirements of the period.
