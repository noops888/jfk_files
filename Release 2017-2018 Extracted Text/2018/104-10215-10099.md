oo 22 July 1963

On qualifications - there just aren't any in the
civilian’ or industrial category = The university work in
Economic Sciences was real, not cover, but interrupted before
I got the degree (5 years). However, f specialized in Economic
Theory, which when considered that I studied in three “atin
American Universities (Costa Rica, Guatemala and Cuba) does
give me some qualification as a Latin American Consultant".

The classfication as "Research Analyst" is cover excert
for that part of which the "Latin American" background could
be utilized. Be ite ‘

Although I have had no business experience in an administrative
or executive capacity, I am sure that I could qpalify in that
work, especially if ig were in connection with Latin America or
utilizing my Spa:.ish language ability.

As you can see by the above, unfortunately there is no
comercial "counterpart" for the type of work I have been doing
for 15 years or more. My feeling is that we should consult the
"local outplacement” man first, on the possibility that there is
a local oprortunity, but the opsortunities in the “atin American
field whill be greater.

(In acdition to the above, I might add that I have performed
best in "operations" work"= which involves planning, direction.and
coordination.) :

1, The Station would appreciate any information which Headquarters can
provide concerning an ETD for Harold R. NOEMAYR and his family and an
ETA for NOEMAYR's replacement. ‘NOEMAYR's tentative ETD of | January
1960 is only slightly more than one month away and he has visas to obtain in
addition to other departure preparations,

2, NOEMAYR was instructed by the Station to Proceed with the necessary
correspondence with Mexican, Costa Rican, Cuban, and Panamanian authorities
for the required police certificates for his wife since she is not a citizen of
PBFRIME and is applying for an Immigrant Visa. He has already received the
necessary dociments from Costa Rica and Cuba and expects to obtain the
Mexican certificate within the next two days. No reply from Panama has been
received as yet although it should arrive shortly. As soon as the Panamanian
clearance and that from Mexico is obtained, NOEMAYR will submit all papers
to the local ODACID installation and request the necessary documentation for
the travel of himself and his family. As Headquarters is aware, the Immigrant
Visa for NOEMAYR's wife will be valid only so long as she travels within four
months of the date issued,

FROM t Chief of Station, Habana SR

GENERAL ~ Adniniotrative

sUBIECT 1
a = Arthur G, VAIVADA i
oe i

Reference: HAVA 755

1, Diséussions of the whole problem of VAIVADA’s early TDY to Headquarters
were held between the agent, the field case officer, and the Chief of Stat4on on i
13 and 1) January, es a result of which it becane clear that, unless Headquerters i
has a compelling reason to the contrary, it would be advisable that the contes- !
Plated TDY be postponed until about the end of VAIVADA’s current contract year, :
d.e., the period of July-august 1957. :

2. A number of important personal problems dispose VIAVADA to accept the
delay in acquiring staff status that would accrue from such a postponement, is
wife 4s sufficiently 411 at this time from a form of nervous colitis as to recon-
mend that she not travel now, His children would have to-lose a semester of
their schooling since the current semester began on 7 January. Moreover as he
and family have resided in tropical areas for a number of years, VAIVADA would
have to make a rather large financial outlay to purchase needed winter clothing
for himself and his family which does nct seem justified for a period as short
88 two months. Oving to several routine but time-consuming inquiries being made
by the local ODACID in connection with his wife’s visa application, there is no
guarantee that VAIVADA would be able to depart Cuba before February 1957,

3+ On the operational side, in spite of the.original Station request tha
VAIVADA’s trevel be expedited, advantages now of delaying his TDY outweich the
disadvantages, from the Station’s point of view. Most important of these is that
two promising sourzes currently under development by the Station, namely AMPHODARCH-
6 and MPHODARCH-10, were originally contacted by VAIVADA and he has since been
the person working most closely with then, To substitute hia with a relatively
untrained cut-out at this point in their development 4s not desirable, On the
basis of the original proposed timing of bis trip the Station has however proceeded
with firm plans. to transfer handling of two other sources, AMPHODARCH-1 and AMSI-
VALINT~5, to a reliable PBPRIME cut-out. This plan can be initiated whether
VAIVADA departs now or later, and provides the ideal opportunity to take two low-
level sources off VAIVADA’s hands thereby freeing the latter to undertake new

development of specific student Commnist and Youth targets the Statton has
already lined up, Both these sources have passed through an tnitial pertod of
trainin: and have fully demonstrated their reliability and ability toconttnue
to perform effectively via a cut-out. In handling @ half-dozen sources, as
VAIVADA has been doing, he reached the limits of reasonable span of control and
hes not had the time to give to such new developmental work which is his forte
and upon which {t would be most desirable to have him concentrate rather than
upon the mere routine handling of relatively tested sources,

L. Delaying VAIVADA’s TDY as proposed herein would place VAIVADA at
Headquertera at or about the end of hte current contract year, where he would be
immediately available for Personal consultation regarding his future ass‘ enment
whether or not 1t is decided that he retum to Habana or sent: to a new Dost. In
this connection the Station wishes Parenthetically to point out its definite
interest in having VAIVADA reassigned to Habana for at least one additional year

if possible, and to note that VAIVADA has expre:sed a personal desire to that
effect,

5, Regardless of the decston as to tintnz of his travel, VAIVADA is
Proceeding to change his residence, He will try to obtain a suitable house
Possessing a telephone, something he has lacked heretofore, thereby carrying
Shrough plans previously reported to Headquarters in para-taph 6 of HFH-A-Sebh.

6. Therefore, unless there exist truly urgent reasons for VAIV:DA’s
travel to Headcuarters prior to about July 1957, it is recommended that his
trip be postponed until that time,

3. Interpretation of the "Commted Rate Table”
requested in paragraph three of the references _
‘ a

a. Shipsiont of 4,000 iba. of ERE fron lasbington, D.C. to
Hiowi (1,111 niles) — $12.00 rate is used. In thie instance the
mileage {a nore than 1100 miles (Colum of Table Ho. 3);
therefore, any mileage in excess of 1100 miles up to and including
1950 mil the rate in Colum B ($12.00) is used for shipment of
4,000 loa. and up.

b, Minimm rates—(1) Three hundred fifty pounds billed at
200 pounds: reinbursonant at the applicable rate for shipment of
500 pounds 1g guthorixed. If billing fo less than for 500 pounds,
reinburssnent is applicable thereto. :

(2) Shipmont of 850 pounds HEE from Rockville, Karyland,
to Kiami and billed for 1,000 pounds: reinbursezent - since the not
weight (850 lbs.) exceeds the nuxber of pounds ahovn in Column. 2
(776 lbs. ~ broakpoint in lbs, for 1150 miles), the applicable
rate ie that shown in Colum D ($15.00 for 1150 miles), and the
spplicable rate is the minimm bundredveight of that Colum (D),

of the actual weight (850.1bs.) of the IRE transported,

(3) The 1,000 pound minimm weight allovance for ebipment
to or from Fishers Taland, Ney York 1s for additional allovance only
and does not apply to shipment of effects frou Rockville, Maryland
to Miami.
