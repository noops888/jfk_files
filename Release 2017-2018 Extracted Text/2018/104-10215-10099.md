INDEX

1. Authorization is hereby requested for the project described

below, whick we plan to initiste on l June 1949.

In view cf

the comment contained in parsgraph 2 of referenced communi

assumine that contencement of this project co

a simple exploratory basis has already been approved by head-

quarters.

so further commitrents, other than those descriced

below, will be made.

ho Objectives

(1) Cutout services, as suggested by headguerters.

an effort to

test Subject's abilities.

(2) As a basic and continuing assignment to permit

enccurage development of Subject's best

local contacts as we'l as in the hope of filling

a long-felt need in cur operational petiern, he

will be assigned to the general topic of labor;

specifically,

communist penetration of local

non-communist labor groups and theoretical

developments which are of interest regardless

of croup designation.

(3)

Subject appears to be genuinely iuterested and

to possess an unusual appreciation for cerational

ways and mesns, which is selden encountered.

For this reason, none of his assignuents will

be exclusive, and he will be encouraged to follow

such leads and opportunities as arise in the

course of his dally occupations regardless of

any objective and target assignments.

never been properly developed or directed.

(2)

In the labor field, the principal and only target

at the noment is the only labor federation, the

Rerun Kovarws.

(3)

Subject will t

represent our only contact among the

student groups and

certain allied "intellectual"

societies.

Any activity in this category showing

promise may subsequently become en assigned target.

C. Cryptonym and Essential Data on Personnel

The designation "Hydropathic, heretofore applied to

subject individual, is hereby discarded. He will

for essential data on personnel, see TZP-A-365,

D. Control and Contect

Judging by Subject's background data and his alreedy

denonstrated cooperative attitude, we do not feel that

control and direction of his activities will be any

problem. Contact, owine to the nature of this project,

will be

freguent and carried out in any convenient

manner, generally in one or the other of our respective

bones.

B. Corer

Subject had planned to and has established himselr in

Costa Rica for entirely personal reasons, prior to any

contact with this office.

He has a Costa Rican wife,

attends the university, and lives a perfectly normal

life which any assignments from us will not disrupt.

Our only anticipated problem is that of routine contacts

between Subject and the Chief of Station.

will be handled with core and discretion.

F. Cost

DESENSITIZED

Subject has agreed to serve for a salary equivalent

Er one 2?

$50.00 per month,

to be paid in colones. To offset

this expense we plan to dispense with the services of

Hucklebone who 1s presently receiving $400.00 per Ionth.

G. Timing and other Factors

Our preliminary Interviews with Subject lead us to

believe that he will be the interested and relia ble

American cutout for which this station has long felt

a need.

His greatest virtue in this respect appears

to be an understanding of operational methods and an

appreciation of relative valus with respect to infor

mation.

It 1s hoped to make this a permanent project,

but our plans and our arrangements with Subject are

considered to be probationary, dependent

entirely

upon

his development and future usefulness.

On qualifications - there just aren't any in the

but interrupted before

I got the degree (5 years) • However

was real, not covery specialized in Economic

Theory, which when considered that I studied in three

datin

American Universities (Costa Rica

Guatemala and Cuba) does

give me some qualification as a "Latin American Consultant".

The classification as "Research Analyst" is cover except

for that part of which the "Latin American" background could

be utilized.

Although I have had no business experience in an administrative

work

in connection with

utilizing my Spa: ish language ability.

As you can see by the above, unfortunately there is no

com ercial "counterpart" for the

type of work I have been doing

for 15 years or more. My feeling is that we should consult the

"local outplacement"

nan first, on the possibility that there is

a local opportunity, but the opjortunities in the vatin American

field whill be greater.

(In acdition to the above,. I might add that I have performed

best in

"operations" work"- which involves planning, direction and

coordination.)

1. The Station would appreciate any information which Headquarters can

provide concerning an ETD for Harold R. NOEMAYR and his family and an

ETA for NOEMAYR's replacement. NOENAYR's tentative ETD of l January

1960 is only slightly more than one month away and he has visas to obtain in

addition to other departure preparations.

2. NOEMAYR was instructed by the Station to proceed with the necessary

correspondence with Mexican, Costa Rican, Cuban, and Panamanian authorities

for the required police certificates for his wife since she is not a citizen of

PBFRIME and is applying for an Immigrant Visa. He has already received the

nccessary documents from Costa Rica and Cuba and expects to obtain the

Mexican certificate within the next two days. No reply from Panama has been

received as yet although it should arrive shortly. As soon as the Panamanian

clearance and that from Mexico is obtained, NOEMAYR will submit all papers

to the local ODACID installation and request the necessary documentation for

the travel of himself and his family. As Headquarters is aware, the Immigrant

Visa for NOEMAYR's wife will be valid only so long as she travels within four

months of the date issued,

Discussions of the whole problem of VAIVADA"s early TDY to Headquarters.

were held between the agent, the feld case officer,

and the Chief of Station on

13 and ll January, as a result of which it becane clear that, unless Headquerters

has a compelling reason to the contrary, it would be advisable that the conten-

Plated ToY be postponed until about the end of VAIVADA's current contract year,

1.e., the perlod of July-August 1957.

wife is sufficiently 11l at this time from a form of nervous colitis as to recom

mend that she not travel now. His children would have

to lose a semester of

their schooling since the current semester began on 7 January. Moreover as he

and fardly have resided in tropical areas for a number of years, VAIVADA would

have to make a rather large financial outlay to purchase needed winter clothing

for himself and his family which does not seem justified for a perlod as short

as two months.

Owing to several routine but time-consuming inquiries being made

by the local ODACID in connection with his wife's visa asplication, there is no

guarantee that VAIVADA would be able to depart Cuba before February 195%

two promising

sources currently under development by the Station, namely AMPHODARCR-

6 and AYPHODARCH-10, were originally contacted by VAIVADA and he has since been

the person working most closely with them.

To substitute him with a relatively

untrained cut-out at this point in their development is not desirable. On the

basis of the original proposed timing of bis trip the Station has however proceeded

with firm plans to transfer handling of two other sources, AMPHODAPCH-1 and AMBI-

VALENT-5, to a rellable PBPRIME cut-out. This plan can be initiated whether

VAIVADA departs now or later, and provides the ideal opportunity to take two low-

Level sources off VAIVADA's hands thereby freeing the latter to undertake new
