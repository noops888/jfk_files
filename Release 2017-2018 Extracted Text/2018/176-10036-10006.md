10 MAJOR GENERAL JOSEPH MOBUTU, IN A LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER

CYRILLE

ADOULA DATED 22 DEC 1961, EXPRESSED THE FOLLOWING VIEWS

REGARDING THE PROPOSED ATTACHMENT. OF CONGOLESE NATIONAL ARMY (CNA)

TROOPS TO THE UNOC MILITARY COMMAND:

A. THE UN PROPOSITIONS FOR CNA PARTIGIPATION IN KATANGA OPERATIONS

DO NOT EXACTLY CORRESPOND TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CONGO (GOC) PROPOSALS,

THE PRINCIPAL PROPOSAL BEING THE PLACEMENT OF CNA TROOPS AT THE

KAMINA BASE. (SOURCE COMMENT: MOBUTU CONSIDERS KAMINA THE MOST

IMPORTANT STRATEGIC POINT IN KATANGA.) WITHOUT POSSESSION OF THIS

STRATEGIC

: POINT, NEGOTIATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT OF KATANGA (GOK)

REPRESENTATIVES ARE USELESS. CNA OCCUPATION OF KAMINA WOULD

PERMIT THE GOC TO:

NEUTRALIZE GOK TROOPS IN KANIAMA AND KABONDO;

ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHIEF KASONGO-NIEMBO;

AVOID THE DESTRUCTION THAT WOULD ENSUE TO PROPERTY BETWEEN

LULUABOURG AND ELISABETHVILLE IF CNA TROOPS LAUNCHED A GROUND ATTACK

IN KATANGA FROM LULUABOURG; AND

GIVE THE CNA A BASE FROM WHICH TO MOVE AGAINST SOUTH KATANGA

VIA BUKWAMA AND KOLWEZI.

B. TO SUPPORT THIS OPERATION, THE CNA CAN PROVIDE A BRIGADE

COMPOSED OF THE FOLLOWING TROOPS: 3RD COMMANDO BATTALION, 8TH

INFANTRY BATALLION, I3TH INFANTRY BATALLION, ZND RECONNAISANCE

SQUADRON, HALF A COMPANY OF COMBAT ENGINEERS, AND THE I7TH INFANTRY

BATALLION FOR GUARD DUTY, THE 2ND RECONNAISANCE SQUADRON AND THE.

3RD COMMANDO BATALLION ARE STANDING BY IN LULUABOURG

AND ARE READY TO DEPART IMMEDIATELY, THE REMAINING TROOPS CAN BE

CONCENTRATED AT LULUABOURG ON 48 HOURS NOTICE.

C. THE MOVEMENT OF THESE TROOPS DEPENDS EXCLUSIVELY ON UNOC.

MEANS OF COORDINATING THE GENERAL KATANGA OPERATION CAN BE DISCUSSED

AFTER THE CNA TROOPS ARE AT KAMINA BASE. HOWEVER, IT WOULD BE

A MISTAKE TO WAIT FOR THE END OF SUCH DISCUSSIONS BEFORE TRANSPORTING

SECRET

THE . TROOPS, WHICH MOVEMENT WOULD ITSELF STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE COURSE

OF THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH UNOC.

GOC MUST BE PRUDENT IN ITS DEMANDS FOR THE MOMENT. THE UNOC PROPOSALS

IMPLY A TOTAL ABANDONMENT OF GOC AUTHORITY OVER THE TROOPS PUT AT

THE DISPOSAL OF UNOC AS THE OBJECTIVES OF THE UN COULD DIFFER

FROM THOSE OF THE GOC AND AS THE UN, UNDER THE PRESSURE OF CERTAIN

INFLUENTIAL MEMBER STATES, COULD CEASE TO PROSECUTE THE KATANGAN

OPERATION, THUS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE GOC TO OBTAIN FORMAL

GUARANTEES FROM UNOC BEFORE AGREEING TO ITS PROPOSALS.

E. GENERAL MOBUTU DOES NOT BELIEVE INTEGRATION OF CNA TROOPS WITH

UNOC TROOPS IS WISE. COORDINATION ONLY TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOC/UNOC

OBJECTIVES WILL LEAVE THE GOC, IN THE EVENT DIFFERENCES ARISE WITH UNOC

WITHOUT

/ LIBERTY OF ACTION; UNOC CONTINGENTS PRESENTLY IN KATANGA HAD TO

BE INTEGRATED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE LOGISTICAL SUPPORT,

BUT THE CNA IS ON ITS OWN TERRITORY. AND HAS EXISTING BASES AND

LINES OF SUPPLY FOR MUNITIONS AND EQUIPMENT: INTEGRATION WOULD .

TAKE AWAY FROM THE CNA ITS NATIONAL CHARACTER AND WEAKEN THE GOCIS

DIPLOMATIC POSTURE VIS A VIS THE UN AND FOREIGN POWERS.

F. THE ONLY IMPORTANT AND IMMEDIATE GOC REQUIREMENT IS AIR

TRANSPORT FOR TAKING THE CNA TROOPS TO KAMINA. ALL OTHER ASSISTANCE

CAN BE DECIDED THROUGH DISCUSSION WITH UNOC AFTER THE TROOPS HAVE •

ARRIVED. IN HELPING TRANSPORT CNA TROOPS TO KAMINA, UNOC WILL BE .
