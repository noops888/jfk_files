support.

They have

not been tested

of 3 lack of potential but 1 am confident they will do the job

well as required. I rate Mr. Noore superior in his ability to

represent CIA and the Intelligence Community on the outside and

he does a very good job in representing DED within CIA and the

Mr. Moore is admirably qualified.

He has been able

to. coordinate these essentially independent activitles most

efficlently.

His entire organization perforns in a responsive

and highly effective manner and produces timely, well balanced

reporting.

Although Mr. Moore's staff was relatively stable during

1974, two of his key officers were incapacitated for extended periods,

both at times when the work load was especially heavy.

procedures which he has established enabled the offfee involved to

continue to handle priority matters effectively in each instance.

On at least two occasions in 1974 Yr. Moore had to intercede

n complicated and difficult sicuations, and in each instance his

judgment and highly professional approach resulted in successful

solutions.

SUBJECT:

MOORE, J. Walton

Mr. Moore is a calm, mature, respected and popular

"officer who handles' his complicated job with the easy assurance

that comes only: from experience and past success.

I believe that

i's largely due

to Mr. Moore's personal reputation that so many

of our jundor officers want to work in Dallas.

During 1974 Mr. Moore recommended the establishment of &

one-man residency

as a more efficient way to handle our

responsibilities in that part of Texas:

We agreed, and the Residency

was established In mid-1974.

Although it has been in operation only

a few months, che wisdom of Me. Moore's recommendation 18 already

apparent, and l am.conf.ident that the success of the Residency will

continue.

7. Rating: Strong.

A copy of this memorandum, with reviewer's comments, w1-ll

He now supervises one.of our

COS BENTAL

Section C

Yo. James Malton Noore is hereby nominated for a

Career Intelligence Medal in recognition of his

contributions to the missions of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, the Office of Strategic Services, the

Strategic Services Unit and the Central Intelligence Agency

for nore than 37 years.

3. Nalzon (Jim) Moore spent most of his boyhood (1920-27,

1950-j6) in Shantung Province, China with his missionary

Following graduation from Hardin-Simmons University

Jin joined the FRI

and served as a Special Agent in

both chicago and

San Francisco.

During the latter assign-

ment he reported

on pro-Communist clements in Chinatown and

directed a US Government panel to interview aliens and US

citizens returning home to

ensure that enemy agents were not

slipping into the US as rofugces or foreign businessmen.

Jim joined OSS in November 1944 and was commissioned

as an

Ensign,

USNR.

His first

assignment was in Kunning

where he recruited and trained Chinese

agents to infiltrate

Japanese lines. While in Kunming he took parachute training

and on fugust 17, 1945 jumped into the Japanese

internment

camp at weihsein.

Following evacuation of refugees he

•became Chief of Mission in Isingtao.

Returning to the US

in December 1946, he was reassigned as Vice Consul and

Jin Dairen.

Soviet intransigence prevented

his reaching Dairen so he

remained in Tsingtao for an

additional year until

transferred as

in

Calcutta, arriving there in April, 1948.

Jim returned to the United States in October 1949 and

joined the Contact Division,

Office of Operations, CIn.

CD/00 policy favored continuity and Jim was no exception.

Fron 1919 to 1954 he served in the Houston Ficld Office

from 1954-1978 as the Resident Officer in Dallas.

Contac: Division evolved into the Domestic Contact Service

and a reallocation of resources raisod the Dallas Resident

Offica to Field Office status.

Jim was the obvious choice

for the job. After nine months training and preparation in

lashingion (where he performed admirably) he was

as Chief of the new office with responsibility also for

Residant Offices in Tulsa, Houston, New Orleans and, even-

tually, Austin.

CONTOENTIAL

Section C (continued)

Jim's wörk. in Dallas 'has

been: consistentl) excellent.

Under his*leadership

the Dallas comple!

has provided timely

forcign intelligence in response to worldwide priorities

and requirements..

As

an example, in April 1975 the Acting

Director,

Stratetic Rescarch conmended Jim for "outstanding

performance" for urgent

special efforts to obtain infornation

which resulted in a reduction of over 500,000 in the

Intelligence Community's estimate of the total number of

Soviet military personnel.

Similarly,

the Dallas Office has provided excellent

support to the Clandestine Service.

In forenber,

1976 the

Chief,

FR Division commended Jim and his staff for "outstanding

support" from October 1975-October 1976 in efforts which

were "indispensable" to the establishment of FR assets in

Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in identifjing and

assessing prospective targets for recruitment.

There are very.few persons-@f.potcntial. consequence. to

the Intelligence Community in Texas who Jim Moore does not

know and little that he cannot accomplish there on behalf

of Community and gency requesters.

The assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in

November 1963,

the

subsequent allegations

against ClA and

Jim Moore's long association with Agency interests and

programs in Texas have made him a repeated target for media

attention and scurrilous innuendo.

Although

under various

forms of sevore. external pressure

as a result, Jim Noore

never lost his cali,

cool demeanor and has been absolutely

dependable in adversity.

An experienced professional, a true sentleman, a delight-

ful person

and an

been

example to be

emulated, Jin Moore has

a real credit to the intelligence profession.

is he

approaches retirenent, he

richly deserres recognition in the

form

of the Carcer Intelligence Medal.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Domestic Collection Division;

DDO

SUBJECT

Appreciation for Outstanding DCD

Performance

1.

I want to express the appreciation of the

Office of Strategic Research for the special effort

recently made for us by J. Walton Moorc of your Dallas

field office.

Mr. Moore responded quickly to our

urgent request to obtain information

on.

from DS-2172 and provided it to us on

very short notice.

2. Let me give you some background.

The subject

of

emerged

as an important

issue in a recent conmunity-wide effort to reassess

total soviet military manpower.

The community reassess-

ment was stimulated by DIA reporting of several months

ago that existing estimates of total Soviet military

manpower were low by almost one million men.

If correct,

the DIA appraisal had potentially serious implications

for the ongoing MBFR negotiations as well as a host

= of

intelligence judgments about the dimensions of the

Soviet military threat.

3.

During the ensuing interagency review of the

individual estinates contributed by various agencies

in the Washington area, we came to the conclusion that

the number of

Testimated by an •

Army intelligence group was much too high.

A rapid

scarch of headquarters' files turned up barely enough

intelligence to prepare an estimate of a portion oi the

but no direct evidence on total

At this point it became clear to us

that an imoraved estimate might be made with information

As we had to present our case to the

Furthernore, Mr.

-Moore's questions elicited sone new information of value

to future work. Most important, the results of CD's

efförts contributed significantly to convincing the

working group that the original Army estimate

•too high.. Eventually the estimate we submitted based

upon the information supplied by l

was accepted

by the manpower Steering Group and resulted in a

roduction of over 500,000 men in the intelligence

community"s estimate of the total number of Sovict

military personnel.

The effoits of your people struck a mighty

for good intelligence.

Many thanks.
