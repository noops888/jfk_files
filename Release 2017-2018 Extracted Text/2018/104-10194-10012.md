MEMORANDUM FOR: J, Walton Moore

” THROUGH ": Head af Career Service

SUBJECT : Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their even-
tual retirement, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each
employee well in advance of the date he is scheduled for retire-
ment. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to advise~ you~

that you are scheduled to retire on ___ 5 Octoher 1979.

2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves
serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the

. transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence.
To assist you in this regard, the Agency offers various resources

hich are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. You

will, in the near future, be invited by the Retirement Counselor

for your Directorate to an individual pre-retirement counseling
session, or more than one if you wish. This phase of retirement
planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation
and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement
system under which-you will retire.. The individual counseling
sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on
such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits,
life and health insurance, Social Security, taxes, relocation
and movement of houschold effects and assistance in obtaining
other employment. In addition, you will be invited to attend a
Retirement Information Seminar that wili be offered in the
autunn of 1974.

3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the
scheduled date and who wish to commence their planning as early
as possible, prefer to work with their Retirement Counselor well
before the time he would normally contact them. If you believe
you wouid benetit from such an earlier start on your personal
planning, you are entitled to contact the Retirement Counselor
responsible for your Directorate at the Retirement Affairs Division,
212 Magazine Building, on telephone extension 3328.

randum by signing below. The original of this memorandum should

[couwente OF Ravigwina OFFICIAL
I concur in Mr, Watts' evaluation. Mr. Moore is a very

good administrator and his office has performed its collection
mission very well and provided excellent éperational services and
support. They have not been tested in our emigre program because
of a lack of potential but I am confident they will do the job
well as required. I rate Mr. Moore superior in his ability to.
represent CIA and the Intelligence Community on the outside and
he does a very good job in representing DED within CIA and the
Community. In a pinch I feel that I could depend on Mr. Moore
more than almost any other DCD field chief of his grade.

STATEMENT CONCERNING Tia EVALUATION
(OF MY PERFORMANCE.

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

CouitnTe OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL
I concur in this evaluation. My principal interaction with Jim Moore during the

year has been the result of our mutual concern for the vell-being of a capable officer
who performs well and has growth potential but who is difficult to work with and has,
on occasions, apparently been on the brink of a physical breakdown brought on by
tension, overwork and. other factors. In his approach to this problem, Jim has been
concertied, compassionate, responsible, and thoroughly professional.

Under Jim's direction, the Dallas complex has achieved a high ranking among DCD
offices and is holding it.

While Jim Moore {s a long-time DCD officer, he seems to have lost none of his
enthusiasm and drive. He is a valued and respected colleague.

1, Jim Moore continued in his,assignzent as Chief of the
DCD Field Office in Dallas during the period under review, with
responsibility supervision of Resident Offices in Houston,
New Orleans and and a new Residency His Letter
of Instruction dated ? Novenber 1973 renains current.

2. The Dallas Ficld Office with tts Tour satellite offices

represents the most complicated fleld office structure in DCD.

. While Mr. Moore's staff consists of only jofficers and
secretaries, more than half dre located outside the field o a

, The Dallas Office requires a chief who 1s experienced in resident
office operations, is able to sotivate ‘and’ éanage’ people from a”
distance, and who can keep personally familiar with a wide variety
of activities. Mr. Moore is admirably qualified. He has been able
to, coordinate these essentially independent activities most
efficiently. His entire organization performs in a responsive
and highly effective manner and produces timely, well balanced

report ing.

3. Although Mr. Moore's staff was relatively stable during
1974, two of his key officers were incapacitated for extended periods,
both at times when the work load was especially heavy, The operating
procedures which he has established enabled the office involved to
continue to handle priority matters effectively in each instance,

4. On at least two occasions in 1974 Nr. Moore had to intercede
in complicated and difficult situations, and in each instance his
judgaent and highly professional approach resulted in successful
solutions.

“James Walton Moore is hereby nominated for a
Carees Intelligence ‘Medal in recognition of his substantial
contributions to the missions of the Federal Burchu of
Investigution, the Office of Strategic Services, the
Strategic Services Unit and the Central Intelligence Agency
for more than 37 years.

J. Walton (Jim) Moore spent most of his boyhood (1920-27,
in Stiantung Province, China with his missionary
pareats. Following graduation from Hardin-Simmons University
in 1940, Jim joined the FBI and served as a Special Agent in
both Chicago and San Francisco, During the latter assign-
ment he reported on pro-Communist clements in Chinatown and
directed a US Government panel to interview aliéns and US
citizéns returning home to cnsure that enemy agents were not
Slipping into the US as refugees or forcign businessmen.

Jin joined OSS in November 1944 and was commissioned
as an Ensign, USNR. His first assignment was in Kunming
where he recruited and trained Chinese agents to infiltrate

chute training
and on August 17, 1945 jumped into the Japanese internment
camp at Neihsein. Following evacuation of refugees he

in December 1946, he was reassigned as Vice Consul and

his reaching Dairén so he remained in_Tsingtao Yor an

Jim returned to the United States in October 1949 and
joined the Contact Division, Office of Operations, CIA.

Fron 1839 to 1954 he served in the Houston Field Office and
from 1954-1977 as the Resident Officer in Dallas. The

Office to Ficld Office status, Jim was the obvious choice
for the job. After nine wonths training and preparation in
Washington (where he performed admirably) he was assigned

ments. As ai example, in April 1975 the Acting
Director, Stratetic Research commended Jim for “outstanding
performance”, for utgent special efforts to obtain information
which resulted in a reduction of over $00,000 in the
Intelligence Community's estimate of the total number of
Soviet military personnel.

. Similarly, the Dallas Office has provided excellent
Support to the Clandestine Service. In November, 1976 the
Chief, FR Division commended Jim and his staff for “outstanding
Support" from October 1975-October 1976 in efforts which
were "indispensable" to the establishment of FR assets in
Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana and in identifying and
assessing prospective targets for recruitment.

know and little that he cannot accomplish there on behalf

of Community and Agency requesters.

The assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas in
November 1963, the subsequent allegations against CIA and
Jim Moore's iong association with Agency interests and
programs in Texas have made him a repeated target for media
attention and scurrilous innuendo. Although under various

been a real credit to the intelligence profession. As he
approaches retirement, he richly deserves recognition in the

SUBJECT : Appreciation for Outstanding DCD
Performance

1. I want to express the appreciation of the

Office of Strategic Research for the special effort

recently made for us by J. Walton Moore of your Dallas

field office. Mr. Moore responded quickly to-our

urgent request to obtain information on E eae feat
from DS-2172 and provided

very short notice. :

<2. Let me give you some background. The subject
of emerged as an important
issue in a recent community-wide effort to reassess
total Soviet military manpower. The community reassess-
ment was stimulated by DIA reporting of several months
ago that existing estimates of total Soviet military
manpower were low by almost one million men. If correct, na
the DIA appraisal had potentially serious implications
for the ongoing MBFR negotiations as well as a host of
intelligence judgments about the dimensions of the
Soviet military threat. ~ .

3. During the ensuing interagency review of the
individual éstimates contributed by various agencies
in*the Washington area, we came to the conclusion that
the number of estimated py an
Army intelligence grou Swuch too high. A rapid
search of headquarters’ files turned up barely enough -
intelligence to prepare an estimate of a portion or the
but no direct evidence on total
At this point it became clear to us
that ed estimate might be made with information

Steering Group early in the week of a

Tot Chief, SFB. PPD” :
Subjecti Hr. J. Welton Moore, Agent, Contact Office, Dallas, texas

I should like to call attention to the outstanding
cooperation given our activities in Dallas by J. Walton Koore,
resident represontative in Dallas, Texas.

Mr. Mcore has not only extended the normal hospitality of
his oftices, but has.gohe out cf hie way to nozinate and talk ~
with exéeptional pecple whe coue to his attention es potential
euployes for the Agency. kr. Nocre has contacted wo from time
to tiae with names end cozsents on individuals, and in every way
attezpted to serve as an active sersonnel scout in his area. I
fevl his efforts and tine consuzed in interviewing people have
gore a good deal beyond the norgsl expectations of cur agency,
ang that thie attitude best represents the unified type of
teamwork which our drganization subscribes to in this work.

hile my experiences with the resident offices in ay area
have been uniformly a ploasant: experience, it is a matter of
real satisfaction to find a man who is thinking in terms of the
Agency aa a whole and not of one sharply defined activity. I
believe the spirit that kr. Moore shows should be brought to the
attention of his superiors as a prize exenple of teauwork in the
field. It 18 not only a rersonal satisfaction to do business
with Hr. Moore, but it greatly contributes to the morale of our,
efforts by knowing that other of:ices are ag concerned as ve
are in preducing reeults.
