representatives of a number of countries. On 04 February an

agent in Moscow succeeded In getting prepared information to

the American Ambassador.

These actions brought about a

change in the UN's position regarding this financial problem

and pushed the American delegation to reach a compromise.

Mark LANE 1d well known as a person with close ties to

Democratio Party circles In the US:

He holds liberal views

on a number of current American political problems, and has

undertaken to conduct hie own private investigation of the

circumstances surrounding the murder of J. KENNEDY. This

coincided with the interests of the KGB, and the New York

Residency, through a trusted contact, passed LANE 1500

dolate for. his work on a book, and 500 dollare for a trip

to Europe In connection with the investigation he was

conducting.

This trusted contact of the Residency was a

special services might also have known about this, 1f LNE

was under observation at this time. While in Europe in

1964, he wanted to visit Moscow and acquaint the authorities

there with the revealing materials. he had regarding the

KENNEDY murder.

The authorities took into consideration the

sensitive nature of LANE's investigative activities and did

not wiah to enter into difficulties with the US; LANE's trip

was therefore tactfully postponed indefinitely.

Trusted

contacts from among Soviet journallets met with LANE, and

beginning in 1969 Borovik maintained regular contact with

him.

LANE once again expressed to Borovik his desire to

visit Moscow and bow the authorities there the film that he

had put together, which discredited the official version of

the President's murder. Once again he was delicately told

that the time was not right for such a trip, since the

American government might begin a slander campaign against

him in connection with his involvement in the anti-war

movement.

American Communists who were. in Moscow in 1971

expressed the opinion that, although LANE was engaged in

doing this not without profit to himself, and sought to

well-concealed political conspiracy.

On 18 August 1975 photocopies of a note from Lee Harvey

OSWALD, prepared at Center, were sent from Mexico to three

American citizens who were independent investigators of the

checumstances of president KENNEDY'e murder:

the note was as follows:

The content. of

"8 November 1963.

Dear MI. HUNT, I would like to receive information about my

position.

I only want information.

I propose that we meet

and discuss this matter thoroughly before any steps are

OSWALD. Y me of by someone else. Thank you, lee Harvey

The conception of this active measure, codenamed

"Arlington," was based on the use of an assassination theory

that was widespread in the US, according to which theory

Howard HUNT, a former CIA employee who was convicted in 1974

in connection with the Watergate affair, participated in

1963 in organizing a plot, the victim of which was President

KENNEDY :

The note given above was composed using individual

phrases and expressions taken. from letters written by OSWALD

during his stay in the USSR, the note was written in

OSWAlD's handwriting on a scrap of the writing paper that

OSWALD used in Texas.

This note was on two occasions

subjected to graphological and chronological examination

"for authenticity" by the Third Section of the KGB'& OTU

(Operational-Technical Directoratel

OSWALD's note was accompanied by a another note:

"Sir: At one time Mr. KELLY from the FBI received from

me a document which, in my opinion, will help shed light on

the circumstances surrounding the murder of President

KENNEDY.

Since KELLY has to date not done anything with

this document, I, fearing the worst, and forced to disappear

for a time.

Knowing that you are

ergaged in an Independent

investigation of the President's murder, I am sending you a

copy of the document. With best wishes, Yourd, P.S."

It was intended that the perdon who received the

photocopy of the OSWALD note would request that FBI Director

KELLY produce the original note.

KELLy, naturally, would

deny that he had received such a note, and this would

encourage the Investigator even more to obtain the desired

document.

The note was sent to: Harold WEISBERG, the author of

several books about the KENNEDY assassination that rejected

the official version put out by the Warren Commission,

argued for the existence of a political conspiracy, and

Investigated OSwalD's ties to the special services:. Dan

Jones, the editor of the Miclothian virror newspaper, who

had investigated the assassination from the point of view of

a conspiracy, and Howard HOFMAN (possibly HOrEMaN, and

historian from Philadelphia who had Investigated the KENNEDY

assassination and cast doubt upon the conclusions of the

Warren Commission.

The documentary operation "Arlington" was carried out

in such a way as to fuel (the flames of suspicion] with

fresh news and to expose the participation of the American

special services in the liquidation of KENNEDY.

At the beginning of March 1977 the first reference to

the "previously unknown note from Lee Harvey OSWALD"

appeared in the American press.

The Minister of Justice

(aic--1.e., Attorney Generall

announced that it was

"impossible to determine through laboratory testing whether

the letter was authentic or fabricated."

However, at the

beginning of April there appeared in the New York Times an

that "the note dated 08 November 1963 was written by Lee

Harvey OSWALD." The authenticity of the OSWALD note was

also reinforced by a reference to the testimony of Lee

Harvey's widow, Marina.

American newspapers, however.

did

not tie OSWALD to the HUNt who had formerly worked for the

CIA, but rather to his namesake, HUNT, who was a deceased

Texas oil millionaire.

The FCD's disinformation service believed that OSWALD's

connection with HUNT the millionaire, rather than with HUNT,

the CIA officer, was purposely played up in the American

press in order to divert public attention from OSWALD's

Newspapers emphasized the fact that "KELLY, the curcent FBI

Director, who had received the original document, had

concealed it from the public and had not circulated it."

REFERENCE:

Lotus note dated 8 May - ARRB Meeting 12-13 May 1998

The JFK Board addressed six Agency issues at the 13 May meeting. The Agency's proposals prevailed in four of the six issues

enone and one issue was tabled for further discussion. The Board made the following determinations:

1) Alias Documentation and Accommodation Addresses:

accepted our proposal to postpone release of specific information until 2017 and use generic substitute language.

2) LITAMIL CIA penetration of Cuban Embassy in Mexico City/considered a "key player" in the Oswald- Mexico

City story):

agreed to continue to protect the full crypt and delay the release of additional documents (201 file) until his death.

They set an annual review date on the documents; the Agency will need to advise NARA annually on his status.

3) Richard Gibson | member of Fair Play for Cuba Committee during early 60's/considered a "key player in

Oswald's story

4) AMTRUNK Assets [AMTRUNK was an early 1960's anti-Cuban operation; most of the details of the operation

including crypts have been previously released]:

agreed to protect true name and 201 file numbers of assets not previously released.

5) Mark Lane Item (extract from foreign document):

postponed until 4 June meeting; board would like have a member or its staff confirm the existence of the

document and ensure that it contains no other JFK assassination related information.

6) Carlos Tepedino ICIA asset/ key figure in AMLASH-Cubela plot to kill Castro/true name and role in story has

been publicly known for years:

voted to release his name in the 1967 IG Report on Plots Against Castro and other JFK collection documents

The Stone/Golitsyn issue was pulled from the agend and will be addressed at the next meeting (4 June).

This was a very successful meeting from the Agency's perspective. The loss on Tepedino was not unexpected. Given what is

in the public domain, the Agency has not been able to make a persuasive argument to protect his name in the three years Tepedino has

been at issue. Thanks to all who assisted in preparing for the meeting, and especially to

who prepared the

issue and talking point papers that carried the day.
