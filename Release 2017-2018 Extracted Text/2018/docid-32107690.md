MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

FROM:

SUBJECT:

W. David Slawson.

Intercepts from the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in

Mexico City

The following are my notes from reading the inter-.

cepts: in question in the American Embassy in Mexico City;

translated from the Spanish by Embassy personnel, on April 13,

1964. These notes are about as accurate and detailed as I

could make them without actually quoting the entire trans-

cripts. In a few instances, either where it was very important

or where the meaning was obscure and therefore difficult to

paraphrase, I have quoted exactly.

I have noted these portions

by placing them in quotation marks.

September 27 - 10:37 a.m.

A person who sounds like an American speaking poor

Spanish, later Identified as Lee Harvey Oswald, telephones the

Soviet Embassy.

OSWALD: May I speak to the Consul?

INSIDE VOICE: He is not in.

• OSWALD: I need some visas in order to go

September 27 - 4:05 p.m.

A woman's voice, speaking in Spanish, later Identi-

fied as Silvia Duran, speaking from the Cuban Consulate,

calls into the Soviet Embassy.

SILVIA DURAN: There 1s an American here who has

requested an in-transit visa because he is going to Russia.

I would like to know whom he spoke to at the Russian Embassy,

because I sent him to you thinking if he got a Russian visa

that I could then issue him a Cuban visa without any more

processing: Who did he speak to?

He claims he was told there

were no more problems.

INSIDE VOICE: Wait a minute. (The inside voice

then explains to someone else on his side of the line that

Silvia Duran 1s calling, that she 1s calling in reference to

an American who says he had previously been to the Soviet

Embassy, etc.)

ANOTHER INSIDE VOICE: Please leave the name and

number and we will call you back.

SILVIA DURAN: (She leaves her name and her telephone

number and/she then engages in some personal conversation in

regards to the fact that she has recently changed apartments

and therefore would like the "bulletin" sent to her new address.

The voice in the Soviet Embassy agrees.)

SILVIA DURAN:

We have to wait too, because he knows

no one in Cuba and therefore It's difficult to give him

a visa.

He says. he knew it would take a long time to process the Soviet

visa but hoped to await that in Cuba.

RUSSIAN EMBASSY:

"The thing is that 1f his wife 1s

now in Washington she will receive the visa for return to Russia.

She will receive it and then can send it any place but right now

she does not have it."

visa here because we do not know if his Russian visa will be

approved."

RUSSIAN EMBASSY: "We can issue a visa only according

to instructions."

SILVIA DURAN: "That is what I will put in my plans.

RUSSIAN EMBASSY:

"We can't give him a letter of recom-

mendation either, because we do not know him. Please pardon the

bother."

SILVIA DURAN:

"No bother.

Thank you very much."
