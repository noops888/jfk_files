bones, and a noticeable scar on the lower right side of his chin.

"win rans."

pass American currency to the Negro. This unidentified Cuban ap-

parently came out of AZUE's office onto the patio. ALVARADO des-

cribed the Cuban as a tall, solidly built mulatto, with curly hair,

who appeared to be about 37 years old. He was wearing a brown suit

and a red-striped tie. ALVARADO never saw this man again after 18

Negro (in Spanish): "I can't go with you:

I have a lot

to do."

OSWALD

'The people are waiting for me back

there."

The Negro gave OSVALD six thousand five hundred dollar:

in large denomination US bills saying:

"This isn't much." Of the

sum, one thousand five hundred dollars was for extra expenses.

The

Negro also gave him about 200 Mexican pesos.

Later, ALVARADO saw a pretty girl, whom he betieved to be.

= Cuban employee of the Consulate, give OSWALD an abrazo embrace

and tell him she was living at Callo Juarez number 107 where he

could findher

The girl appeared to about 20 years old and had

manners which reminded ALVARADO of a prostitute. OSWALD, the Negro

and the Canadian then went upstairs.

ESPECESA

ALVARADO left the building momentarily to buy popsicle

on the corners he saw the above three men leave by the Embassy gate

near the corner of Tacubaya where they entered a parked black car,

possibly a Churolet.

At the end of September, ALVARADO telephoned the American

Embassy several times to report his belief that someone Important

In the United States was to be killed.

When ALVARADO saw OSWALD's photograph in the newspaper,

he again contacted the Embassy on 25 November.

was affectionately greeted by a female employee of the Cuban Em-
