that information in government possession in respect to hood-

lums which we got from BROWN and RUSTON would, in any case,.

be most properly presented to any Defense Counsel from the

files of the ATTD itself.

The Bureau is requested to advise Albany in the

event it is desired the information in the memoranda regard-

ing BROWN and RUSTON be obtained from them on a current basis

with clearance to disseminate it. It is noted both BROWN

and RUSTON have been reported as having testified before the

Special Grand Jury in the SDNY which returned the indictment

in U.S. VS. BONANNO, et al.

Both BROWN and RUSTON have been interviewed in

hoodlum perjury cases and their interviews reflected on

FD 302's were, of course, all furnished on a non-confidential

basis, after obtaining clearance and with the understanding

that testimony might be required and this, of course, presents

no problem. It is recommended that only the letterhead memoranda

reflecting interviews with BROWN and RUSTON designated on pages

following as items 44 and 45 (BROWN) and item 111 (RUSTON) be

disseminated.

In respect to MELVIN JOHN BLOSSOM, the Bureau's

attention is particularly directed to the fact that he was

formerly Confidential Informant AL 3002-C, discontinued by

Albany letter. 3/24/59. Of course, he is known to the Attorney

General's Special Group at New York City and his name undoubtedly

has been mentioned in testimony before the Special Grand Jury.

In addition, he has been interviewed and carried openly in the

hoodlum perjury cases in the recent past.

A review of the memoranda reflecting interviews

with BLOSSOM will indicate that initial memorandum and FD 302's

contain all material information he furnished regarding hoodlums.

herein and that the numerous other memoranda contain little

information of value and, by their number, content and regularity

of date of interview clearly indicate that we were using BLOSSOM

as an informant. He furnished information on a confidential

basis, except in the initial interview and the perjury case

interviews mentioned. Accordingly it is recommended that there

be disseminated, in respect to interviews with BLOSSOM, only ..

those letterhead memoranda designated as items 9, 31 and 33 on

the following pages.

The memoranda submitted herewith are listed in alpha-

betical order, by name of person interviewed, then by date of

interview, on the bottom of this page and following pages. Each

memorandum is identified by date of interview, name of witness,

communication in which initially set forth, in that order. A

notation "no" meaning no FD 302 or signed

statement is entered at

the end of each line, except where there is an FD 302 or signed

statement, in which instances the notation entered is "302" or

"SS" (for signed statement, as the case may be). Where "ss" appears

a photostat of same is attached to the memorandum.
