PROJECT LIONTON.

Identification. This is a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance
operation against the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

Objectives. The operation is designed to (1) furnish photographic coverage
during daylight hours.of the entrances of the target installation, (2)
dispatch physical surveillance teams against persons associated with the
target, and (3) keep in readiness a listening post for the monitoring and
recording of eventual technical penetration operations of the target.

The target installation is the PERUMEN Bnbassy compound (including
Consulate) in Mexico City. The above-listed objectives are accomplished by

two trained, full-time ieichctarreenne agents who live across the street from
the target.

The project is in consonance. with Priority A, Objective 1, of the
current Related Mission bisa Mexico.

Background. This project, herewith presented for approval for the ait dis me,
does not represent a new operation. hi HAO tivit: ince

operation produces photographs of, persons associated with the PBRUMEN Embassy,
both staff and visitors. These photographs are normally reviewed for identi-
fications by the PBRUMEN section at the Station, then shown separately to

arrival of a new Hmbassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the
Station, In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos
{accompanied by a log kept by the | LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action
(arrivals and departures) and details of personal associations (who associates

with whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against
the target. |

l
In addition to photography, LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 are often called won
to do visual surveillance of the target installation and LIONION-1 is essential
to the dispatching of the LIMMBRACE surveillance team against individuals
associated with the target. Because of the presence of police patrol cars i
the. vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to the
target, hence the need for LIONION-1's dispatching services.

The presence of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 also insures continued occupancy of
a valued piece of real estate which will be used as a listening post when the
Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in ine
target in the form of concealed radio transmitters. -


D. Operational Assets (Personnel),

LIONION-1 isa young PBRUMEN lawyer in exile. He lert PBRUMEN in 1960,
Planning to continue on via Mexico to the United States where he vesided in
his early years, His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer
in the Department of Commerce in Washington, the other a Police official in
Tampa, Florida, While in Mexico LIONION-1 was recruited, ag LILILY-1, to
Perforn PBRUMEN operational support services for the Station and, once having
& taste of clandestine activity, decided to remain in Mexico, LIONTON-2, (irs)
Was recruited in 1961, as LILILY-2, as a basehouse Occupant and
operator in the LIFEAT/LIERODE: technical operation aimed at the PERUMEN
Embassy. Ag this same time LIONION-1 algo Phased into LIFEAT/LIERODE work and
the two. worked together as @ team. In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked
together in brocessing the take of the LIFEAT/LIERODE (TRAP installation, now
known as LIOMEN, At this time their eryptonyms. were changed from LILILy-1 and
2 to LIFEUD-22 and 23, respectively. In the latter Part of 1962 the two agents
began the Present Photographic surveillance Operation,

Communication is primarily with LIONION-1; with LIONION-2 only in his
absence. Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls (calls
from LIONION-1 go through a telephone cut-out), are usually held at the
LIONION-1 safe apartment. This apartment, which would appear to be a LIONION-1
love nest, is in another area of town. The Station KURIO? technician,

Hugh T. FRANCOITE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week. The Case Officer,
Lawrence F. BARKER, meets with him less frequently. Whereas LIONION-1 knows
the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOITE's true identity.

e.. Security Evaluation. If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican

authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed
to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMWAVE
area on a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering
their income. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flagrante
with the KURIOL automatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such
refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an. exile organization.
In any event, LIONION-1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican
president's office, This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protectio
enabled him to weather the tax investigation and can be used by him to overcome an
future difficulties with Mexican authorities.

Under Mexican law, the principal (photographic) activity of the project is
not illegal, therefore ‘uncovering of the photographic operation would not: of
itself result in arrest or prosecution. It is usually possible to stave off
investigation or house search for a period of time sufficient to remove compromis-
ing material from the premises. ‘The LIONION base house was once cleaned complete].
in one evening and could again be cleaned, probably in less time, if circimstances
should warrant,

The target installation is aware that-photo surveillance is a probability.
On one occasion AMKNOB-1, a JMWAVE asset, was shown a nearby building (not the
LIONION base) by a PBRUMEN Embassy officer and told that it was a KUBARK photo
base.

LIONION-1 is known by sight to some PHRUMEN Embassy staff personnel who have
observed him in the neighborhood. ‘Presumably they believe he is a Mexican. To
avoid operational compromise, he cannot renew his expired passport at the
PBRUMEN Consulate. For this reason the Station will request -KURIOT in separate
correspondence to prepare new passports for both LIONION agents so that they may
travel outside Mexico. :

Security measures employed inthis operation are designed to make it virtuall:
impossible for any opposition service to link LIONION personnel with the Station,

Coordination. Coordination with other PBPRIME elements or the Mexican government
is not necessary at this time and none is envisaged.
