Question #3 - Did McCone or Raborn have any information on this:
nese What?

Answer:

Office of Security records contain only limited information
in regard to this question. The SE Division (then SR) was the
responsible office for the confinement of Nosenko until late
October 1967 when total responsibility was transferred to the
Office of Security by the DCI. It is presumed that the DCI was
at least generally aware of the confinement of Nosenko and the
conditions of confinement, but any definite statement must be
based on SE records.

Question #4 - Where is Nosenko working now?

Answer:

Nosenko is currently employed at his personally owned F
residence in North Carolina. He is engaged in research and
analytical work based on his previous knowledge of the KGB
and other Soviet matters. He is in the Washington, D. C. area
for several days approximately every six weeks for direct
interviews by the FBI and Office of Security personnel.

Question #5 - Is he working for CIA?
Answer:

Nosenko has been employed by the Agency on a full-time
contractual basis since 1 March 1969. The original contract
has been periodically amended to reflect additional remuneration,
primarily to compensate for cost of living increases. In late
197%, Nosenko was compensated by mutual agreement for salary
not received during the 1 April 1964 to 1 March 1969. In addition,
on 12 July 1973 Nosenko signed an acknowledgement and release
of the United States Government and the Central Intelligence
Agency from any claims prior to that date.

Question #6 - What is his legal status?

Answer:

Nosenko was naturalized as a United States citizen in
April 1974.
