Quality Uranium Deposits in*
Cuban Mine

This report is believed to contain information of operational interest and may not be disclosed to. personnel outside
the Directorate of Operations withoit the prior permission of the omestic Collection Division.

le agio Cantillo,
jis a former Cuban general. In 1956, when
was €) ‘OF tha Cuban. Air Force under Cuban dictator Ratista,
Cantillo's uncle ceme to him with an ore aanple the uncle had
uncovered in an abandoned former Spanish mine in Cuba. The mcle
suspected the ore was uraniam. Cantillo brought the specimen to
the US, where {t wac aasayed by an unnamed US survey company as
being the richest uranium suxple the firm hed ever tested. Cantillo
aad the mele, who vere the only individuals aware of the location’
of the mine, recognized archaic Cuban lave did not protect their
find, 20 the general attempted to get Batista to change the mining
statutes. Batista suspscted tha soneral had come across somthing
sipnificent, andhhe sant a tean ofjmen to tha Pinar del Rio area
for six months on a search, The team uncovered nothing. Batista
also tried to vork out a deal wheré he would be a partner in the
wenture as a pre-condition to changing the mining lays. He was
unsuccessful. in convincing Cantillg to pernit him to become a
partner. At that time, the revolution reached full intensity, and
Batista left the country. i

23 Cantillo's uncle 1s still in Cuba.‘ Despite Cantdllo's imprisonment
by the Fidel Castro regime for nine years, he has never told snyone
about.bis uncle's find, Avproxinately one year ago, Cantillo
approached a retired Agency staff employee and informed hin of the
uncle's find. He did eo after all ithese years because of the
developing relations between the US and Cuba, Cantillo feels the
US may te able to make use of information that Castro does not
possess about the riches that exist in his om nation, end that
Castro and the USSR would capitalize on the find if they were to a
Decome avare of it. In his viey, the 0S shoula know of this
potentia’ before it conducts negotiatioas with Castro. The general
ia willing to provide the name 6f the assay company, so that
documentation can be obtained on the purity of the uranium.

3. The general's US contact notes Gantillo is not the sort of mn who

speaks inaccurately abort things och as this. He describe! Cantillo e
asa "solid my", and says the information Cantille has provided a
probably is reliable. : 3
