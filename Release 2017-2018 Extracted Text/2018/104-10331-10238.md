Heradon, Virginia 220710; FOR RELEASE.

Dear Bob,

It was very good to meet with you again in Washington on June 12.

I am writing to confirw our recent convereation about the CIA's release
of documents about me to the National Archives. fs I explained to you at
cur meeting, I am very displeased that this was done without ny knowled-

Agency fcr the first time in thirty years.

contains a cory of my photo from the late 1960s. I consider this a breach
of my personal security.)

wery personal nature. Other pages deal with with some very sensitive
cases. which I gave the Agency about other people. The information in
these reports was given freely and accurately by me to the CIA officers
in the 1960s under terms of strict confidentiality. Although it is very
difficult for me te say this, I feel that my trust in the Agency has now
been seriously dameged. ‘ = :
This release particularly troubles me. because for the past thirty years”
I have remaineé very loyal to the Agency and considerate of its wishes.
For instance, despite many requests, I have only, spoken to a few jouré
nalists, and only when the Agency advised me ta@So. I have never sought
