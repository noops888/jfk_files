arrested and put to a lie detector test.

But the

CIA slipped him a pill that so disoriented him

as to throw off the test and the matter petered out.

Also since the Bay of Pigs:

Cubans were

recruited in Miami to fight in the Congo. They

were recruited to plant bombs at Expo 67 and on the

U.S

•- Mexican borders.

(The objective was to

punish Canada and Mexico for playing footsie with

Fidel by discouraging tourism.) CIA agent

was killed ina small plane crash while trying

to smuggle $1 million in gems into the U.s.;

the CIA hushed it up.

A Cuban explained how the Cubans got into

Watergate: "They were used to us. When Bay of Pigs.

operatives like Hunt moved over to Watergate they

sent for their old Cubanos. They work a little

like a Mafia, "he continued. "When they want to

issue an anti-Communist contract or what looks like

an anti-Communist contract, they contact us.

We're reliable, intelligent, professional. And

we're learning to keep our mouths shut.

We're

learning to live with this. And we fear the

Company. We know the Company. The Company can drop

a word and change your life. You don't get a job or

a loan for your business, or you're in trouble
