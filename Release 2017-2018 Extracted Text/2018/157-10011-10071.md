recruited in Miami to fight inthe Congo. They
were recruited to plant bombs at Expo 67 and on the
U.S.- Mexican borders. (The objective was to
punish Canada and Mexico for playing footsie with

was killed in@ small plane crash while trying

to smuggle $1 million in gems into the U.S.;
the CIA hushed it up.

@ A Cuban explained how the Cubans got into
Watergate: "They were used to us. When Bay of Pigs
operatives like Hunt moved over to Watergate they
sent for their old Cubanos. They work a little

we're learning to keep our mouths shut. We're
learning to live with this. And we fear the

a word and change your life. You don't get a job or

Cd] a loan for your business, or you're in trouble
