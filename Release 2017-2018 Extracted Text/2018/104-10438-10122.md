Entry in "Historic Diary".

[DDP 4-0864]

"1.

• In a document entitled 'Historic Diary' there appears an entry

which refers to

'an elderly American'.

The entry is under the date 26

October 1959 when OSWALD was allegedly confined in an unidentified Moscow

hospital.

It is apparent that every effort should be made to iden-

tify the elderly American, if he existed.

We assume the lead is

still outstanding.

urgently request through its channels a careful search of Embassy and Con-

sular records in Moscow which might reveal the identity of an elderly

American hospitalized

days before the assassination.

His replacement did arrive in September.

AZCUE was schedu-

led to leave in October but did not leave until 18 November.

We do not know who might have told OSWALD that AZCUE or any other

Cuban had been or

was to be replaced, but we

speculate that Silvia DURAN

some Soviet official might have mentioned it if OSWALD complained about

AZCUE's altercation with him."

Subject:

Documents on

Lee Harvey OSWALD Furnished by the Soviet Govern-

(DDP 4-1764]

"1.

The Soviet documents forwarded to this Agency under your letter of 20

May 1964 provide some additional detail on OSWALD.

The information in

these documents parallels that already available from other sources, and

does not contradict our previous information.: The documents do clarify

somewhat OSWALD's alleged occupation at the Minsk radio plant giving the

original Russian terms used in decsribing his job.

"2.

The following points relating to the documents are worth noting:

A significant omission from the materials provided is the letter

OSWALD allegedly wrote to the Supreme Soviet requesting Soviet citi-

zenship.

"B.

OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for

Stateless Persons, and a second receipt in 1962 for his Identity

Document for Foreigners.

the similarity of wording of the receipts

regarding his understanding of Soviet residence and travel regula-

tions further supports our belief that such regulations are identical

or nearly identical for bearers of either type of identity document.

This means that OSWALD should have obtained permission in July 1961

to travel to Moscow, but, as we know from other cases, failure to ob-

tain travel permission is not uncommon and not a serious offense.

The includsion of Marina's exit visa 'application' is singular

view of the fact that the Commission had not requested information

on Marina.

"d.

The Soviet translators for OSWALD's early documents are believed

to be identical with persons already referred to in OSWALD's 'diary'.

The format and wording of subject documents appear to be consistent

with Soviet practice."

[DDP. 4-3401]

The following remarks have been recently attributed to Soviet Consül

Pavel Antonovich YATSKOV in Mexico City regarding the subject.

'I met OSWALD here.

He stormed into my office and

wanted me to introduce and recommend him to the Cubans.

He told me that he had lived in the USSR.

I told him that

I would hate to

check before I could recommend him.

He

was nervous and his hands trembled, and he stormed

out

of my office.

I don't believe that a person as nervous as

OSWALD, whose hands trembled could have accurately

fired arifle.

Our Mexican Station has checked its records for the period OSWALD

and has advised it is quite possible that OSWALD

though he had talked with Valeriy KOSTIKOV when he actually had spoken

to YATSKOV; or that he first spoke to KOSTIKOV who turned him over to his

superior YATSKOV.

Statements Reportedly Made by George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT

Concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the Assassination of President Kennedy:

[DDP 4-3479]

"1. The information furnished below has been received from usually reli-

able sources and consists

of statements reportedly made by the de MOHREN-

SCHILDTs concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the assassination of President

Kennedy.

Shortly after the assassination of President

Kennedy, George and

Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT were

among the guests attending a cocktail party in Haiti.

The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were asked if there was

any substance to the view expressed in certain foreign

periodicals such as L'Express, a left-wing Parisian

weekly newspaper, that the Kennedy assassination was

a plot organized by Dallas millionaires.

MOHRENSCHILDT said that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very

reactionary elements in Dallas had

organized a plot to zet rid of Kennedy and used a dis-

turbed person such as OSWALD to achieve their ends.

Mrs: de MOHRENSCHILDT agreed fully with this thesis.

"3. A copy of this memorandum is being forwarded to the FBI."

27 August 1,964

CSCI-316/00856-64 Subject: Lee Harvey OSWALD - Internal Secu-

rity, Russia - Cuba. . Reference:

Your Memorandum dated 28 July 1964.

"1.

A review of the results of monitoring

Soviet foreign broadcasts at

the time when

interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD had

apparently been

taped was conducted with negative results.

Therefore, it is

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over

a local USSR facili-

ty for internal consumption.

"2.

With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked if any

attempt had been made by the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for propaganda

purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts, or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in Minsk.

Subject: Konstantin Petrovich SERGIEVSKY

Memorandum for Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel EtC(DDP 4-44791)

The files of this Agency contain no identifiable traces on Konstantin

Petrovich SERGIEVSKY or on his sister.

"2. We have no information which would either confirm or refute allega-

tions that Lee Harvey OSWALD made one or more visits to the city of Gorky

in April and May 1960 or at any other time.

"3. The term 'mokrym delam' which appears in

the notes which SERGIEVSKY

brought with him to the British Embassy may be translated 'wet affairs' or

'liquid affairs'.

It is an expression or jargon used by the KGB to refer

to activities involving kidnapping or assassination.

RANKIN asked for Agency comments concerning allegations of a Soviet

Embassy Moscow one out levskY, who walked into the British

on 29 July 1964.)

The captured documents in this set range in

JOESTEN had been a member of the Communist Party of Germany since 1932.

You will note that the attention of the German security organs was direc-

ted at JOESTEN as early

as 1936.

At that:time the Communist Party had been

been outlawed in Germany and the German authorities apparently had begun

collecting information about JOESTEN and his activities.

Their investiga-
