"On the question of why Lee OSWALD felt that he could not get his Mexican
visa extended without using his real name, the following may be germane:
Mexican immigration records checked by the U.S. Consulate in Nuevo Laredo
and reported through the U.S. Embassy to both out office and yours, showed
that Lee OSWALD entered Mexico on 26 September 1963 using the name HARVEY
OSWALD LEE. It may be that OSWALD feared that any attempt to extend his
visa would result in discovery that he was in the country under a false
name; he might have had to show some identification to get the visa exten-
ded, and he probably had no documentation in the name of HARVEY OSWALD

Entry in “Historic Diary". , : ; (DDP 4-0864]

a ..iIna document entitled 'Historic Diary! there appears an entry
which, refers to ‘an elderly American’. The entry is under the date 26
October 1959 when OSWALD was allegedly confined in an unidentified Moscow

hospital. . . . It is appareft that every effort should be made to iden-

tify the elderly American, if he existed. . +: . -Wé assume the lead is
still outstanding. It is our recommendation that the Department of State
urgently request through its channels a careful search of Embassy and Con-
sular records jin Moscow which might reveal the identity of an elderly
American hospitalized at the end of October 1959 and possibly registered
with the Embassy as a tourist. An independent confirmation of this de-
tail could be of freat significance in validating'the entries of OSWALD's
"Historic Diary' and would possibly lead to the development of additional
information on OSWALD's stay in the USSR."

19 February 1964 Memorandum for Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel etc.

Subject: Cuban Consulate and Embassy in Mexico City. [DDP 4-4581]

"1. Reference is made to your letter of 10 February 1964, relative to in-
formation supplied by this Agency on the activities of Lee Harvey OSWALD
in Mexico City eee

"3, We surmise that the reference in OSWALD's letter of 9 November to a
man who had. since been replaced must refer to; Cuban Consul Eusebio AZCUE,
who left Mexico for Cuba on permanent transfer on 18 November 1963, four’
ines before the assassination. AZCUE had. been in Mexico for. eighteen

ears and it was known (to us) as early as September 1963 that he was to
be replaced. His replacement .did arrive in September. .AZCUE was schedu-
led to leave in October but did not leave until 18° November.

"4. We do not know who might have told OSWALD that AZCUE or any other
Cuban had been or was to be replaced,. but we speculate that Silvia DURAN
or some Soviet official might have mentioned at if QSWALD complained about
AZCUE's altercation with him." :

found the attached photograph (Attachment 'A'): of a group of persons stan-
ding near the Palace of Culture in Minsk. This «photograph was taken by an

in the photograph are not identified in our files, we believe on the basis
of comparison with other pictures that the second person. from the right is
Lee Harvey OSWALD.

"3. It is worth noting that the person believed-to be OSWALD is wearing

a short-sleeved sport shirt of the same design'or pattern as one worn by
OSWALD in pictures taken of him in his apartment in Minsk in 1962. Copies
of two such photographs, which were found among OSWALD's effects after his

Subject: Documents on Lee Harvey OSWALD Furnished by the Soviet Govern-

"1. The Soviet documents forwarded to this Agency under your letter of 20
May 1964 provide some additional detail on OSWALD. The information in
these documents parallels that already available from other sources, and-
does not contradict our previous information.. The documents do clarify
somewhat OSWALD's alleged occupation at the Minsk radio Plant giving the
original Russian terms used in decsribing his Job. oe

"2. The following points relating to the documents are worth noting:

"a. A significant omission from the materials: provided is the letter
i OSWALD allegedly w wrote to the Supreme Soviet requesting Soviet citi-
{ zenship. .

"bh. OSWALD signed a receipt in 1960 for his Identity Document for
Stateless Persons, and a second receipt in 1962 for his Identity
Document for Foreigners. The similarity of wording of the receipts
regarding his understanding of Soviet residence and travel regula-
tions further supports. our belief that such regulations are identical
or nearly identical for bearers of either: type of identity document.
This means that OSWALD-should have obtained permission in July 1961
to travel to Moscow, but, as we know. from. other cases, failure to ob-
tain travel permission is not. uncommon and not. a serious offense.

. "e. The includsion of Marina's exit visa. ‘application’ is singular
if in view of the fact that the Commission d:not requested information
on Marina. .. . : oo,

‘I met OSWALD here. He stormed into my office and

wanted me to introduce and recommend him to the Cubans.
He told me that he had lived in the USSR. I told him that
I would have to check before I could recommend him. He
was nervous and his hands trembled, ‘and he stormed out

of my office. I don't believe that - ‘a person as nervous as
OSWALD, whose. hands trembled could have accurately

fired a’rifle.'

"2. Our Mexican Station has checked its records for the period OSWALD
was in Mexico City and has advised it is quite possible that OSWALD
though hd had talked with Valeriy KOSTIKOV when he actually had spoken.
‘to YATSKOV; or that he first spoke to KOSTIKOV who turned him over to his’
superior YATSKOV.

Investigation."

Subject: Statements Reportedly Made by George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT
Concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the Assassination of President Kennedy.
, [DDP 4-3479]

"1, The information furnished below has been received from usually reli-
able sources and consists of statements reportedly made. by the de MOHREN-
CHILD? concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD and the assassination of President
Kennedy. .

"a, Shortly after the assassination of President
Kennedy, George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT were

among the ‘guests attending a cocktail party in Haiti.
. + » The de MOHRENSCHILDTs were asked if there was 7]
any substance to the view expressed in certain foreign
periodicals such as L'Express, a left-wing Parisian
weekly newspaper, that the Kennedy assassination was

a plot organized by Dallas millionnires. George de ©
MOHRENSCHILDT said that President Kennedy was hated

by the Dallas elite, and he felt that it was very
likely that certain reactionary elements in Dallas had
organized a plot to get rid of Kennedy and used a dis-
turbed person such as OSWALD to achieve their ends.
Mrs. de MOHRENSCHILDT agreed fully with this thesis.

"3. A copy of this memorandum is being forwarded to the FBI."

"1. A review of the results of monitoring Soviet foreign broadcasts at
the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD had apparently been
taped was conducted with negative results. Therefore, it is assumed

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facili-
ty for internal consumption.

"2. With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked if any
. attempt had been made by the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for. propaganda
. , purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts, or lectures.
NOSENKO replied that. this had not been done either in Moscow or. in Minsk.

1964 Memorandum for Mr. J. Lee RANKIN, General Counsel etc.
Subject: Konstantin Petrovich SERGIEVSKY {[DDP 4-4479]

"1. The files of this Agency contain no identifiable traces on Konstantin
Petrovich SERGIEVSKY or on his sister.

"2, We have no information which would either confirm or refute allega-
tions that Lee Harvey OSWALD made one or more visits to the city of Gorky
in April and May 1960 or at any other time.

"3. The term 'mokrym delam' which appears in ‘the notes which SERGIEVSKY
brought with him to the British Embassy may be translated 'wet affairs' or
‘liquid affairs'. It is an expression or jargon used by the KGB to refer
to activities involving kidnapping or assassination. . . .

(NB: RANKIN asked for Agency comments concerning allegations of a Soviet
citizen,, Konstantin Petrovich SERGIEVSKY, who walked into the British
Embassy in Moscow on 29 July 1964. )

the U.S. authorities at the end of World War II. The documents concern
Joachim JOESTEN, author of Oswald: Assassin or Fall Guy?, Marzani §.Muns.

You will note that the attention of the German security organs was direc-
ted at JOESTEN as early as 1936. At that:time the Communist Party-had bee

been outlawed in Germany and the German authorities apparently had begun
collecting information about JOESTEN-and his activities. Their investiga-
