met with AMBIDDY/1 on 13 January

i. When Wallace A, GROVERY
1967 to formally terminate the AMWORLD operation, AMBIDDY/1
discussed in detail reference dependents who had been receiving

» financial ussistance’ from AMTCRLD funds and requested that
GROWERY explore the possibility of WOFACT financial aesistance
following termination of their AMWORLD monthly support payments.
An tnvestigation was conduct. 5
determine ‘if the agents named by AMBIDDY/1 had been employed by
WOFACT in order to determine what, if any, obligation might
exist to provide financial assistance to the dependents. The
results of the combined Headquarters investigation, keyed to _
reference dependents, are summarized below for Station

ififormation.

(IDEN’A). Subjoct was a 3OFACT.agent undor contract. Ris
MOC provided payment. of his $400 monthly salary to
his dependent parents for two years following pos-
sible death while engaged on a WOFACT mission,
After Subject's execution in 1962 the parents received
his regular monthly salary until 28 June 1963. At
that time Headquarters decided to liquidate the
Temaining balance of $6400 and paid this emount in a
lump sum to the parents, Headquarters considers that
all legal anc xerai obligations pave been discharged
and is not itclined to assume’ any further financiel
obligations to the parents. AMBIDDY/1 is apparently
ynaware that the parents have received approximately

$10,000 from WoFacT.

son Sentence, With this information traces vere.
run on Subject. with negative results. Since neither
JMWAYE nor Headquarters records produced any evidence
Subject had ever been a WOFACT employee, no Obligation
exists to provide financial assistance to IDEN B,

2. Although reference indicates the discussion betwoen James
D. ZABOTH and ErnestiA. LUSBY took place after AMBIDDY/1's conver~
sation with GROWERY in January, it is not clear when, or by whom,
the Subject was originally brought to ZABOTI's attention, If
AMBIDDY/1 was the nource of ZAROTH's information tt 1s noteworthy
that he apparently neglected to mention hig prior detailed dis-
cussion with GROWERY.:

anticipated by Hondquarters in Reference, A report preparod by
AMTIKI-1, which is forwarded herewith, describes tho contont.of
his fllos for these cases and. includes a copy, where availablo,
of the authorization upon which payment is based.

P Aprit 963, deseribes four of the
several individuals who were involved with AMLEMON@1
Anoa sabotage attempt against the Cuban Electric
Company on 30 Noverber 1960. The four, att nen
employees af the Electric Company, werd captured’ while
attempting to escape from Cuba in’a small boat following

the sabotage:

William LE SANTE
Luis MEN!
Julio CASTELLES Amigo

Armindo RODRIGUEZ Vizcaino

LE SANTE 1# tho Subject of Case #106 (Hero and Mar tyr)
who was executed ag a result of his partietpation fa

tho sabotage attempt.. MENDEZ Wid CASIELLES, tho Subjects
of Case #49, were also executed on tho same charges,
RODRIGUEZ was wontenced to 30 years imprisonment which

is being served in the Islo of Pinos Prison.

peep The Trustee doscribes himself, Ln the EW Survoy

"form, as a former employee of tho Cuban Electric Company
and a friend of the Subjects of Case #99, Me ts montionod
ina 26 September 1962 AMOT report (AA-812; UPG-01672,
12 Oct, '62).as8 residing in Miawl where he recelvod
lettors, containing information, from source Martha RAMCS
Castro in Havana, Traces. show-RAMOS to bo the wife of
Armando RODHIGUEZ and the sister-in-law of tho widow of
julio CASIFLLES.. The trusteo statod in the NEW Survey
form that one yéar previously he forwarded tho accumulated
funds and started sending $33.00 each month to RAMOS in
Chicago, per instructions by tho CASIELLES widow, and that

-  4n May_1965 hé stopped sending tho $33,00 paymont for the

MENDEZ widew to Cuba and started holding it for her. Ile
claimed to have $165.00 on hand ut timo of tho Survey,
It 48: noted ‘that JMWAVE records contain no mention of
paymont oa benalt of Armando. RODRIGUEZ. The payments on
bohalf of LE SANTE, MENDEZ, and CASIELLES appoar to be
based upon lettors from the COMANDO ELECTRICO DE LIBERACION
which are included with tho ANTIKI attachment. ;

In view of the Caso #99 widows boing in Cuba,. and -the
failure of the trustee to Provide tho oxact date-of-birth
for the widows in his 9 December 1966 reply to AMTIKI
(UFGA~26626, 15 Decombor 1966), it is not believed that he
would have the needed documonts, We are, however, through
ANTIKI-~1 requesting tho trusteo to provido an explanation
of his handling of tho Payments for: both widows, and, via
his meuns of communication with them, to obtain the required

documontation,
ce. Logality of marriages:

None of the widows/wives who provided information for
the HEW Survey described their status as anything but wife
or widow. The PHS form for the Subject of Case: #97 provides

date of marriage as 19 March 1954,

dad. Operational Relationship with Subject:

Case #95: No record of use by WOFACT, Traces reflect
memborship, MDM and/or MRR in Cuba. Tried on 19 April 1961
for crime against the Powers of the State and possession
oxplosives.and inflammable materials. (UFGA-4162, page 464,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, wWi/Cuba

i : ‘SUBJECT : Recommendations Concerning Paymerits to
Dependents of. Brigade Members.

1. A review of the existing files fails to reveal Bae
any evidence ofa clear-cut policy concerning ‘the duration
Of payments to dependents of Brigade members killed, :
captured or missing in action despite the many recommenda- ar
tions made at various times to resolve this problem. This :
lack of policy is implicit in a memorandum from Mr. Helms :
to the DDCI dated 23 May.1962 in which ‘he referred to a i
Presidential. oral directive that payments to dependents .
were to be continued until termination by Presidential _
order. A later ‘memorandum £. Mr. Helms to the DDCI, dated
31 December 196%, contained. recommendations for terminating
these rionthly payments with a lump-sum death payment to -
‘be-made- to, dependents of those killéd:or missing: in action.
y Both, memoranda are..attached for'-your ‘review: .A memérandum
from Mr. Sterling Cottrell to the Attorney General, dated’
1. February 1963, concerning various agreements: reached
between Brigade. leaders, AMBUD and the Agency, also included
three possible alternatives for resolving the problem of
dependency payments-as follows:

A. Follow regulations established..by.the Bureau
of Employment Compensation,.i.e. $1,000 ‘lump sum payment _ :

for loss of life.

israbeee

i B. Follow U.S. Army practice, i.e. monthly
Payments of $122 or more (depending on rank and length
of service) for as long as the widow survives and does
not re-marry. This, Mr. Cottrell pointed out, would be a
costly program to administer and would cost roughly $300,000
a year for an indefinite period. (This has proven to be

true).

Cc. A lump sim arbitrary payment: of $3,000. which

would be a year's dependency, at the highest rate (250::per
month) . ; : Fe : :
2. Obviously, ‘the above recommendations ‘as. well ag.

others. proposed at various timos in an‘effort’ to términate
this’ costly: exercise were ‘never acted. on and’ due to ‘the

"timo lag are Probably’ no longor Practical. Tentative
“approaches ‘to ‘the Problem Were-also made by exploring -the

Possibility of work ing- out some mechanisin by which HEW could
take’ over -disbursement§ at a reduced rate and periodic :
rulings-and guidance were requested from the General
Counsel concerning the legal and security factors inherent

.4n the proposals.

3. When’ the! original cover mechanism wis established
for disbursing these ‘Payments, the dependént's were. apparent ly

+,-Wore available. In view of the indefinite time stipula- -

tion together with the long-standing domise of tho AMBUD
organisation and-its relationship to this program, dependents
be ‘expected to philosophically accept the

light of simtlar. past experiencos, some. carping and. pro~
tests from dissidents can bo ahticipated with the. usual
Security. hazards whenever tho decision is made to terminate
‘this project“ These-possibilitios can hardly justify-the
indefinite continuation of this enormous: expenditure..of
funds which.to date amounts to approximately $2..000,000.00.
Any question. that m: arise as to who has realty: been foot-

F ely. tO cause any shock to the public
eluged with roams of Cuban postmortema,

4. The review and recommendations forwarded by JNWAVE
are comprehensive. and appear to be more than generous in
the approach toward.a two-stage cut-off of payments. I.
do believe the ‘recommendations to. immediately-cease any.
further payments to. trustees Should be submitted to the ::
General Counsel for a ruling.on the. legal technicalities
involved in such a step. This may -also apply to any
attempt to remove existing funds from trustees who are con-
sidered to be unreliable or even dishonest in the administra-
tion of funds-under this control, These trustees were
specifically designated by Brigade members and the written
authorization to.support such trusteeships are in the .
custody of AMTIKI. It would seem that no one but the



-3-

principal himself or his heirs hag the legal rant 1 to.

revoke a. trusteeship-cven in ‘the mishandling of funds.

Based on a review of pertinent documents and a. discussion

with “who is probably more knowledgeable :

of thée-facts and nuances of -this problem than ‘anyono else, : .
ia Ihave listed. bolow:some recommendations for ‘your con= an

-Sideration:

A. In line with. recent: JUWAVE recommend: ions,
‘payments to all principal dependents (wives. who have not
remarried) be reduced by 30 July, or as. s00n as feasible,

to. a flat $100 per month and all minor dependents reduced
4 - to $25 per month with notification. that all payments will
4 ceasyo 6 months from date of initial reduction, All secondary
dependents,. such ag dependent parents who reccive separate
checks Gf not more than $50 por. month, should be continued
at the present rate until ‘tho final termination date for

all dependents.

B. Such ‘adjustments as recommended above should ee
be uniform and across the board’with no attenpt-to ieee
évaluate each ‘case on an individual ‘basis determined by . i
such factors as outside income, need, ete. This would
not only tend to-create an undesirable socurity hazard but
would complicate the phasing out of an already complicated
situation, Furthermore, individuals who -have made. an . .
effort to raise their standard of living by augmentation

7 of their tncomé would be justified in feeling they wore - i!

cs penalized for having more ambition than some of the lazy

“"*" pensioner types. - Once we attempt..to play the role of.
Solomon as.to who is the most worthy'or the most -neody,
we lose sight of the fact that all dépendents are oqual
as widows whose husbands died for the same cause and we
could expect: no end of recriminations.. Neither should
there be any distinction as. is recommended in some instances
by JMWAVE that payments: should cease because- dependents
happen to réside in Cuba. ‘They are ‘as entitled to the
sane benefits, as those fortunate enough to reside in this
country. The exception. to. this may. be justified in those.
isolated cases. where it is evident that nothing has been
heard: from such deperidents: and they have never received
any benefits from the money paid for their support. In
these instances payments to trustees should probably be
terminated immediately if such action is legal.

E Cc. In the case of the known prisoners, two
courses of action could be pursued. Either cut the present
rs dependency payments ‘in line with that proposed for dependents

Furthermore. the, memorandum from-Mr; Cottrell “to: the

Attorney General referred to in ‘paragraph-l ine¢luded as

part of the general agreoment:reachéd with Brigade leaders

aasuranée that payments to dependents of Brigade’ members

he“last proposa
‘ical-point, of view.

~ D.. Prior to submitting recommeridat tons to the.
303 Committee for phasing out dependency ‘payments, a ruling

on all the legal .and- possible security aspects of any
proposal should probably be obtained from tho General Counsel.

5. I have not explored in aepth the background of
the benefits presently being .paid tothe dépendents of
ficroes/Martyrs, the majority-of whith do not’ appear ‘to
have. beon Brigade mémbers ‘and do not. come. undér the same

you aro. contempl ng, te¥minating this: type of payments,
such action could no-doubt. be. dete dod as not “bein;
plicable to the conditions governing dependents of’ Brigade
mombers, It has been my understanding that your proposal
to’ submit a memorandum to the 303 Committee in ‘the immediate
future concerns ‘only recommendations for:resolving the
Brigade dependency. payments. If I am incorrect and-such
memorandum is to also cover the continued. payments to
Heroes/Martyrs dependents, - -please advise meas to _what you
