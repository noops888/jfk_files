Re Chicago airtel summary, 12/30/60.

Reference is made to Chicago daily summary airtel

dated 11/14/60 in case captioned "ACTIVITIES OF TOP HOODLUMS

Information was received from

Company and the difficulties this company had been encountering

with the Garbage Disposal Association.

Apparently the

association had been utilizing pressure in order to stop

the Standard Disposal Company from expanding their business.

It was MURRAY HUMPHREYS contention that an Antitrust suit

should be filed against the Disposal Association and go

through legitimate channels to exert pressure against the

association rather than using muscling tactics. 2.

Dun and Brad Street Inc., report dated 5/2/60,

reveals that the Standard Disposal

and Metal Company,

Inc., formerly at 55 East 18th Street, Chicago, had

to 1216 South Sangamon.

Its officers were listed as

The informant stated that LENNIE PATRICK (Chicago top

hoodlum) and DAVE TARAS (known to the Mrami Office) are FlA.

working together arranging and lining up stops and customers

for this disposal company. Informant said that he knew for

a fact that PATRICK had approached the owner of Marty's

Food Mart, Inc., to line up this individual as a customer

for Standard Disposal Company•

It was the same person who

was the victim of LENNIE PATRICK's muscling tactics in a

shake-down of super markets in 1958. (V)

On 1/5/61, SAS RALPH R. HILL and VINCENT L. INSERRA

interviewed DAVE KAYE who identified himself as the sales

director and vice president of the Standard Disposal and

Metal Company at 1216 South Sangamon.

KAYE was interviewed

in his office at that address.

KAYE was visibly disturbed

over the presence of agents and commented immediately to

the agents that he is a parolee from the State of Florida

and had been convicted of attempted murder in Miami in

1954, however, would not go into lengthy detail as to

AHILL

circumstances

surrounding his conviction other then to

state that he was sent to Miami from Chicago in 1951 by

EUGENE "JIMMY'SJAMES, the then vice president of the

International Laundry Workers Union and head of Local 46 in

Chicago.

KAYE was sent to Miami as deputy receiver and

organizer in an attempt to organize the Laundry Workers

in the south Florida area.

KAYE advised that his Florida

penitentiary number was 53473 and that he was paroled

from the Florida Pepitentiary on March 24, 1959, and his

parole was sponsored by EUGENE JAMES. KAYE stated he

receared a zu jears sentence and hit parole expires la 1975(U)

KAYE said that the Standard Disposal and Metal

Company was organized about a year ago and now has 175 to

180 stops, both residential and industrial, picking up

garbage and scrap. He said that they have

been in difficulty

with the Salvage Association which has, according to KAYE,

"formed a monolopy for restraint of trade" and that the

association is attempting to put them out of business by

closing them out of dumping grounds, pressuring trucking

companies to keep them from purchasing trucks and using

economic pressure on their potential customers. KAYE

insisted that the business has been obtained by underselling

competition, that this is strictly legitimate and that no

muscling tactics are utilized. He said that he knows DAVE

YARAS "slightly" but denied knowing LENNIE PATRICK. He stated

that neither YARAS nor PATRICK are at this time working for

this company and to the best of his knowledge have never

been utilized as salesmen for the Standard Disposal. U)

He said the operations of the Standard Disposal

Company are financed by the Guaranteed Trust and Savings.

It is noted that the Guaranteed Trust was formerly the

Southmoor Bank and Trust, whose president was LEON MARCUS,

slain in gangland style in 1956; after which much speculation

was made to the effect.

that the killing was carried out under

orders of GIANCANA. (4L)

Lounge in the evening to in con me me

WEEKLY SUMMARY AIRTEL

On 12/8/60, PCI ALBERT TEMANER advised SA JOHN J.

MATTHEWS that RINALDO SPADERM, whose true name is ROBERT JACOBS,

has been a personal friend of RICHARD FANNING for many years,

and that he was quite upset at the recent assassination of

RICHARD FANNING.

SPADERM advised TEMANER that he has been

attempting to learn the reason,

for FANNING's murder from MARTY

FANNING, RICHARD's brother. 2

On 12/21/60, SPADERM stated that the opinion of most

of FANNING's associates is that MOONEY GIANCANA was responsible

for his death.

According to SPADERM, FANNING and LESTER BELGRAD

worked together on a shake-down racket. They preyed on business-

men at local hotels, placing these individuals in compromising

positions.

FANNING

would engineer the matter and BELGRAD would

represent himself as a law enforcement officer.

(2)

On several occasions the victims were individuals

close to the syndicate. FANNING and BELGRAD were warned to

desist and when they ignored the warning, both were killed U

TEMANER advised that he did not know how reliable the

above information might be but SPADERM insisted that it was

obtained from individuals who should know g2-3/2/-
