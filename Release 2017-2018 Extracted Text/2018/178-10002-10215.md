Most of my operations ware run out of Eurove.

Q Run out of ~-

A Europe. Some were run out of Miami but the big ones

were run out of Europe.

9 Well, in the course of your activities with respect :
i
to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the i
operations of the Miami base? |
A Yes. |
|
Q And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?
A Yes, sir. |
Q During the nine years you were with ppo's, Cuban
operations, who was ~~ who were the chiefs of the Miami
station?
A 1 think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. 1 should know

it. Well, I will come back to that.
Then, the next Chief cf Station was Paul Henze.
Q what years was he Chief?

ul was there about a year and a half. He

A I think
left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Henze was there from 1966 tc 1968. And then Jake Esterline.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

Q Now, what was the formal title of the group to which

you were assigned for the 9-year period?

a Deputy Director, Plans.
12. Q And that was Mr. Karamessines?

A Yes. Well, it was Helms at that time back when it H

was first created. Helms was DDP at that time.

ov

And Task Force W was created immediately after the

2
16 Bay of Pigs?
17 A Well, not immediately. I think sometime around --
28 in the Bay of Pigs was in April. “I think this was created in

129° september, something like that, 1961.

20 Q And that subsequently became the Special Activities
21. staff?

22° aA Special Activities Staff and consequently became the
2S Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went

A Well, Let's see. I would say that was probably around

1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then

later DDP.

Q Now, Mr.Harvey -- do you recall what position Mr.

Harvey held after he left Task Force W? |

A Yes. He was?€hief of Station, ]

Q And is he still with the Agency?

A oh, ne. He retired a long time ago. i
Q Do you know where he lives at the present time? ,
A Frankly, I don't, I have an idea where he lives. i

He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.

Harvey is a lawyer.

Q Indianapolis area?

a Yes, some place around there. It is in the midwest,
Indiana. i
Q What was the role that was assigned to Task Force

/
Ww?
A It was'the overall Cuban operations.
i) Did the Miami -- when was the Miami Station estab~
lished?
A Well, I think they had a forward operatio-s base down

there about 1960 which was small, in. Coral. Gables.

e BR I can't speak to that but the records that we have
? } don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

¥ : on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hoid

ie) Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a resuit of other agency reporting and that type of thing.

I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a

hit and run,

and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids,

boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations

i

on

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

om

do it on any of our boats, planes, or ~~ anything that belongs :

to the Agency.

Q When Martinez would run such an operation or captain }

a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

together his own crew?

A No. He had an assigned crew and every boat had a

Case Officer operating either out.of the -- probably out of

the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did have

some people in the Hey West base. But he, Martinez, would receilve

z

his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.

along on any cf these operations?

foreign subsidiary of an American company cannot trade with
the country that is designated and Cuba was a designated country.
And all the businessmen were well aware of this. Nobody tried

Q Other than insuring that these companies refused
to accept orders from Cuba, which I take it you feel they were

receive correspondence, particularly, say, from -= well, they

to the Commerce Department and the Treasury Department, or in
some instances they might call me and I would just give them
a Post Office box to send the correspondence to.

Q Any other types of support solicited or received by
the Agency from American business?

A No. Not that I can recall. There just wasn't one
firm we approached, and God knows we approached I don't know
how many, that wasn't extremely cooperative. As a matter of
fact, a lot of them, you know, thought we weren't doing enough,
that we ought to do a little more than we were doing, the

A Following the Bay of Pigs,I don't think so. Not

Q Now, what kinds of operations are included within

A Well, the infiltration. operations, infiltrating
agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage
raids. That is about the extent of it.

shortly after the Bay of. Rigs?

A I would -- I think these operations were probably
at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,
1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December
1968, something like that.

Q Why was the program terminated?

it wasn't feasible to continue these things. The agents were
getting wrapped up. We were -- we just felt that the return
wasn't sufficient for what the investment was.

Q You say the agents were getting wrapped up.

A Yes,

Q What do you mean by that?

A When we infiltrated an agent, Cubans would identify
him and capture him.

Q These various types of paramilitary operations that

were conducted by the Agency I trust were approved by the

Forty Committee?

A Every operation received a specific approval from

the Forty Committee.

A In advance.

initiating such an operation?

one of these operations and the request would go from here
over to the, I guess to the White House and then the Forty

frequently -- they would either approve the operation or say
no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because
the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper
phase for communications and this type of thing. And these
things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were
exiltrating people, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Every Government agency or enforcement agency or military
agency that had any-involvement whatsoever, and the entire

A No.

Q What kind of volume of operations are ‘we talking
about?

A You are not talking about a very big volume of

operations because of the planning that had to go into these
things. I would say that probably at the height of the thing
they may be running three or four a month. No more than that.

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother
ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in to
see if there were mines and this type of thing on the shore

a successful operation. By that, I mean they didn't do as
much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out
because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type
of operation that we did.

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our

own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And. we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.
The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have

averything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because ]

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going ta
extend the credit.
The railroad system was in total disaster. The ©

Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus i
the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment
because they were used to good American equipment. And these
were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

Q In your experience at the Agency can you think of
any other analogus or similar paramilitary operations run
from a base in the United States?

A No.

in the United States.

was. blown or became known, we just crossed that out of

existence and started up a new one.

Q What did Eugenio Martinez do when he wasn't running

these operations?

A Well, he was down -- this is one of the reasons, as

I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that

contract, that retainer, because of the years that he spent

to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to H

| something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

drydock or wherever it was, they had ta remove the sugar and

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -~ there was
i| a vift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to
put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it
acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the
individual, and some of this was done. And then when it

Q Were there many activities of that type?

A Not really. You have got to remember that the
Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a large :
squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-
thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of
hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-
tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from. --
in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts
which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting
to Case Officers and they would report on things in the
community, of people they thought were suspect and this type
of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau
and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved
in CI activity.

Q Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI
