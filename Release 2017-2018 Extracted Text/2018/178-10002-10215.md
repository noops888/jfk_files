your employment with the Agency?

A

When I first came in

• I was in the Intelligence

Directorate for approximately ten years and I was put on special

detail, special indefinite detail, in the Deputy Director, Plans,

which is now the Directorate of Operations.

What year were you put on that detail?

A

I guess it was 1964, January, I believe.

And what did that detail involve?

Cuban operations, economic warfare.

And how long were you on that detail?

I was in the Cuban operations for nine years.

Between 1964

and. 1973?

A

(Nods in affirmative.)

And in 1973 did you assume your current position?

A

Yes, January.

Now, while you were on special detail - to the DOD?

A

Yes.

2

Were you stationed in Washington?

A

Yes.

And did you conmute with some frequency to Miami?

A

Yes.

2

Were your activities in Miami in any way connected

with the operations of the Miami Station?

In some way. My responsibilities were worldwide.

I took temporary duty predominantly in Europe, and then Miami.

Yes.

operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami

Station?

A

I think in 1963

Ted Shackley was the Chief and he

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. I should know

it. Well, I will come back to that.

Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.

What years was he Chief?

I think paul was there about a year and a half. He

left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Henze was there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterline.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

Now, what was the formal title of the group to which

And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations

Group.

Now, was this a special group within the DDo of was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

A

No.

Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing

called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

that -- when Harvey left, he went to chief of Station,L

and Fitzgerald took over, it became Special Activities Staff.

It wasn't attached to anything except - it reported to the

Deputy Director, Plans.

And that was

Mr. Karamessines?

A

Yes.

well, it was Helms at that time back when it

was

first created. Heims was DDP at that time.

And Task Force W was created immediately after the

Bay of Pigs? •

Well, not immediately. I think sometime around --

in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

And that subsequently became the Special Activities

Staff?

A

Special Activities Staff and consequently became the

Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went

back into the Western Hemisphere Division.

And what was

the date of that reorganization?

Well, let's see. I would say that was probably around

1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then

later DDP.

Q

Now, Mr. Harvey - do you recall what position Mr.

Harvey held after he left Task Force W?

A

Yes. He was Chief of Station,

And is he still with the Agency?

A

Oh, no. He retired a long time ago.

Do you know where he lives at the present time?

Frankly, I don't. I have an idea where he lives.

He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.

Harvey is a lawyer.

Well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force W was

established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban

operations?

Yes.

Or was that shared with the Miami base, Miami

Station?

No. The Miami Station was under Task Force w.

All right.

would that also be true of the Special

Activities Staff, the Cuban Operations Group?

A

I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-

nated?

A

At the Station?

Let's see. Sternfield went down

there in 1972.

It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was

in early 1973. It was a gradual reduction.

A

well, let me answer it this way. I wouldn't say

attempts. I know there was discussion.

"Attempts" is too

strong a word.

Well, can you place in time your first knowledge of

any such discussions?

Well, the first knowledge I had of any discussions,

I was on TDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgerald

inl

And I knew that he was going to meet -- let me put

it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on

with a member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as

I recall, he wanted some british - I mean Belgian rifles and

No. Mr. Sanchez was in the Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

Cuban military-type.

Was it your understanding that the Agency had received

instructions with respect to this activity from another

component of the Government?

A

Well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether

they received instructions. I have to assume, and I am pretty

positive, that this was a result of a Special Croup decision.

And at this time you have to remember that Bobby Kennedy was

overseeing this deal, presumably for his brother, and he was

A

Not to my knowledge.

Do you know whether of not Mi. Sturgis ever partici-

pated in any type of paramilitary or other operation against

Cuba?

A

On his own behalf he did, not on behalf of this

Agency.

How did you learn of those operations?

A

Through the newspaper. And through FBI reports.

Now, are these recent FBI reports?

Oh, no. These go back -- I know at one time, the

thing that comes to mind, I think he made a

leaflet drop

over Cuba and this was subsequently reported in the press and

by the Bureau office in Miami.

Do you know who financed his activities?

A

I have no idea.

Is it possible that Mr. Sturgis' activities were

indirectly financed by the Agency through -

I don't see how.

Frank Sturgis is a soldier of

fortune; has been. He has

constantly tried to associate himself

with the Agency. When I went through his file they wanted me

to classify the file and the way I classified it was "don't

destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."

Have you caused the Agency records with respect to Mrl.

Sturgis to be assembled in any one location?

A

Yes. Ihave custody of them.

And what is the volume of that material?

As I recail, there are five volumes. Your Committee

called for them the other day after the article in the paper.

I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and

they returned them Monday afternoon.

Do you know who examined those files?

A

No, I don't.

You indicated

a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD office in Miami

with some frequency, is that correct?

A

well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information.

Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

A

Recently it has been.

Has Mr. Sturgis been encouraged by the DCD office

in Miami?

A

Mr. Sturgis has been told by the DCD office in Miami

to take his information to the Drug Enforcement Agency or the

FBI.

Do you know whether or not they consider him an

Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

I can't speak to that but the records that we have

don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hold

the file.

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a

boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations

and exfiltrations and perhaps one of two raids, hit and run,

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

do it on any of our boats, planes, of -- arything that beiongs

No. He had

an assigned crew and every boat had a

Case Officer operating either out of the - probably out of

the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did have

some people in the Key west base. But he, Martinez, would receive

his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.

2

So it is likely that he could have brought Sturgis

along on any of these operations?

Absolutely

unlikely. Oh, the guy whose name I was

trying to think oi, Chief of Station, John Dimmer.

And that would be.for a period of time between

Shackley and Hienze?

Yes.

Something like that.

Well, there was - it was an across-the-board

intelligence operation consisting of collection of foreign

positive intelligence,

counterintelligence, paramilitary

activities, covert action, economic activities.

That is about

the breadth of the thing.

Now, these were all conducted through the DDO?

A

Right.

Now, let's speak for a moment about the paramilitary

operations.

Were these operations run out of southerr.

Florida?

A

Right.

And in particular out of the Miami Station?

A

Yes.

Were there any other CIA facilities in that area of

the country that participated in these activities?

Were there any southern harbors other than Miami

that were used in these activities?

DDO?

A

DDO.

Now, the facilities that we have been talking about,

training facilities, were manned, then, by the Special

Operations Group, or at least supervised by the Special

Operations. Group, is that correct?

vell, supervised, yes, and I would think that probably

some of the training was given by their people. The Domestic

Training Station is under the Office of Training and -- but I

would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would

probably staff the training facility with their people who have

the expertise in paramilitary operations.

Now, were the people that were being trained at

these facilities basically Cuban refugees?

A

Yes.

And at the outset i take it not many of those people

were American citizens?

No.

Or had become American citizens.

I would assume a great many have.

in Miami? Do you have any idea?

well, it is extremely large. I would think it is

probably - I was trying to think. I would say up towards a

military people.

You spoke about paramilitary operations and covert

action. How do you distinguish between those two categories

of activities?

Well, actually one can fall into the other. The

paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those days

we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was

media placement. We had a number of operations at -- legal-

type operations, harassment operations. For instance, Fidel

seized a great many art treasures and in particular he had a

Napoleonic collection which was supposed to be the finest in

the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings

that were immensely valuable that he tried. to have auctioned

in London and the London auctioneer would not accept them

because he obviously didn't have clear title to them. He was

-- they were stolen, in the eyes of the auctioneer. He was

forced to auction them in Toronto, Canada.

We ran legal operations, got the owners and had them

hire attorneys and bring them to court and this type of thing.

He seized these race horses. He tried to peddle them

in Europe and up in Canada. We ran opposition against that

Bright Stock.

Heavy, heavy oil, and since Cuba - 85 percent of

commodity. Bright Stock can be - oh, it is almost like tar,

melted tar, and it can be cut into additives, lubricants, this

type of thing, and this was critical to the Cuban economy. So

we had an oil firm purchase this Bright Stock from a dealer fori

which ve reimbursed the

Let's taik about economic warfare for a couple of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of

economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

regime, his credit vorthiness, and this type

of thing. We

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days,

guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had

jumped from

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept - Fidel kept

saying that he had such a

poor crop and this type of thing and

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because.

some of our own island assets told us they were out there cutting

this cane like mad and the mills were working. 24 hours a day,

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any

place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he

could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers in

New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar took a

real tumble and all of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't!

want him to get the exchange.

So it was those types of

activities.

Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen or u.s.

companies enlisted in that effort?

A

oh, yes.

2 In what manner did you use

U.s. companies and

businessmen?

A

Well, we simply used them as the experts. A great

many -- the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the

American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything when shey had to pull out. Sugar is the

lifeline of Cuba as far

as any exchange, foreign exchange, thisi

type of thing, and it was

naturally our Number 1 target. So it

was only natural that ive would go to the American businessmen.

what kind of assistance did you seek or obtain from

these businessmen?

well, ve simply talked with them about why -- you

know, the market conditions were, why the price was rising, if

we could find out that Fidel has plenty of sugar, what would

happen to the market price. This type of thing.

They were used as consultants, basically.

we had

a French firm, Societe le Nickel, who was

French firm ex ported to the United States. So we went to

the Ireasury Department and to the Foreign Assets Control

people and said, isn't there something we can do to stop these !

le Nickel exports coming into the United States? So they looked

into the thing and indeed they did.

Who owned the mine?

A

The U.S. Government owned it when Castro took it

So the Treasury simply made the French provide a

and forks, this type of thing, and - you know, stainless

Other than insuring that these companies refused

Oh, yes.

Can you think of anything, any other type of para-

military activity other than maritime operations.

No. I really can't, no.

Am I correct that those operations were manned

by CIA contract employees?

Right.

Right.

Right.

probably have people on detail from other -- from the military

branches in the Government, but other than that I don't think

that -- of course, during the Bay of Pigs operation we also

had people detailed into the Agency.

Now, the training of persons involved in maritime

operations, I take it, was conducted in part within the

United States and in part outside of the United States.

Following the Bay of Pigs, I don't think so. Not

but I don't think that -- I think all the training was done

domestically.

Now, what kinds of operations are included within

this category of maritime operations?

Well, the infiltration operations, infiltrating

agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage

Now, when did. these operations commence? Was it

shortly after the Bay of. Pigs?

A

I would - I think these operations were probably

at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,

1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December

1968, something like that.

Why was the program terminated?

First of all, it was too expensive. It wasn't provid-

ing enough intelligence and it simply wasn't - economically,

it wasn't feasible to continue these things. The agents were

getting wrapped up. We were — we just felt that the return

wasn't sufficient for what the investment was.

You say the agents were getting wrapped up.

A

Yes.

A

What do you mean by that?

When we infiltrated an agent, Cubans would identify

him and capture him.

These various types of paramilitary operations that

were conducted by the Agency I trust were approved by the

Forty Committee?

A

Every operation received a specific approval from

the Forty Conmittee.

In advance?

A

In advance.

Now, what was the procedure for submitting - for

initiating such an operation?

A

Well, normally in the case of an infil or an extil.

or perhaps we wanted to lay down the cache:

You are referring to a cache of arms.

A

A cache of anything, replay of radio, batteries,

whatever they might need. If we decided that we should have

one of these operations and the request would go from here

over to the, I guess to the White House and then the Forty

Committee at its weekly meeting - they used to meet very

frequently - they would either approve the operation or say

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

phase for communications and this type of thing. And these

things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of

Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were

exiltrating people, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Every Government agency or enforcement agency or military

agency that had any involvement whatsoever, and the entire

thing was coordinated.

Do you know of any such paramilitary operations

that were run unbeknownst to the Forty Committee?

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother

ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in to

see if there were mines and this type of thing on the shore

before you go. So he may have considered that all these train-

ing exercises were operations but no way did he ever partici-

pate in any three or 400 active operations into Cuba.

operations launched?

They were mostly launched from the:Keys.

Any other locations?

Not to my knowledge.

a successful operation. By that, I mean they didn't do as

much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out

because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type

of operation that we did.

As I recall, another time we took a team in to burn

some cane fields. Really, the classical operations that we

did in the maritime activities were the infiltrations and

exfiltrations.

Were any CIA operations run out of Guantanamo?

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our

own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil.

We

contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.

The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going

to

extend the credit.

The railroad system was in total disaster. The

Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus

the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment

because they were used to good American equipment. And these

were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

Did any of these companies actually engage in any

legitimate commercial activities?

A

Not to my knowledge, no.

None of them - were any of them in competition with

firms in that area?

A

These are probably what we would call devised

facilities. They were probably registered with the State of

Florida and they paid taxes and this type of thing, but if one

was. blown or became known, we just crossed that out of

existence and started up a new one.

What did Eugenio Martinez do when he wasn't running

these operations?

A

Well, he was down -- this is one of the reasons, as

I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that

contract, that retainer, because of the years that he spent

under such strict operational discipline down in the Keys.

Obviously, he didn't stay down there all the time. He

came back - he might come

back once a month. or something

like that, to see his

family, perhaps once every two weeks

if he got some time off.

A

Oh, yes. Oh, sure.

Were there any operations run out of the United

States which involved destruction of crops or poisoning of

sugar or anything of that sort?

What did you have in mind specifically? You mean the

Puerto Rican thing?

A

well, that is one of the things I had in mind.

Would you describe that for me?

Well, this is, I guess you could term it a target of

opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban sugar

to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to

it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

drydock or wherever it

was, they had to remove the sugar and

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar or the

individual, and some of this was done. And then when it

leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

firm buy it back from

the Soviets.

high and the bull became sterile by the time he landed in

Cuba. No thought given to, you know, pressurizing the cabin

But as far. as

sabotaging any Cuban product, no, we

didn't go into that. Our object was to enforce the blockade

and cut off his sources of supply.

When was the Miami Station established?

As a station?

Yes.

I think in September 1961.

And that was several years before you became involved

in Cuban matters?

_A

Yes.

Do you know of any other facilities of that nature

within the United States, Agency facilities?

A

You mean, targeted against the opposition?

Yes.

A station as such?

Yes.

No. You have some communications facilities that

you really call stations because here again, they are not

Of course, we have FR bases and DCD offices and

Office of Security officers, and so forth.

A

Right.

But I am talking about actual stations.

A

Operating stations, no.

This is the only such station in the United States

as far as you know, is that correct?

Right.

And was this station established to deal primarily

with Cuban activities?

Yes.

Cuban-related matters?

With Cuba, period.

Did it have, when it was established, any other

responsibilities with respect to Western Hemisphere activities?

A

Not to my knowledge.

Entirely limited, then, to Cuban activities?

Yes, and in support of Cuban activity and other

countries in the Hemisphere.

When you joined the group dealing with Cuban

activities, what was the size or the number of personnel

attached to that Station?

To that Station? Well, the Station had probably a

And what kind of facilities did the Station have in

Miami? Physical facilities.

Well, they were located on the south campus of the

University of Florida, I mean, the University of Miami, at

the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained

unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn

well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the

Dixie Highway inland. We had our own guard force.

No.

Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community,

how long could a non-official cover last?

activities. Funded -- it is a giant mechanism when you put

one of these things in for the funding and this type of thing,

• for your ostensible customers, establishing bank accounts.

Yes, I understand.

A

So it was a research activity and the only people that

ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You

know, somebody would make an inquiry, you know, we can't accept

any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this

type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And out of

this one thing, of course, then we were running these innumera-

ble other covers with different activities. The guard

force, of course, were like - well, they wore uniforms, similat

to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think

that there was - in the later days at that site I think the

Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other

Government agencies, in other buildings, of course.

Not really. You have got to remember that the

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-

thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of

hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts

and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-

whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability

to properly staff the thing?

A

Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot

of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section

of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is

known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers

from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a

relationship there that had gone over a period of years

between the Agency and the Bureau.

A.

The largest CIA station in the world.

At its height?

A.

Nothing comes anyplace close to it.

I wonder if you could describe briefly for the record

what the hors were.

A.

Well, the A10TS were Cuban a Cuban intelligence

organization in exile.

We full intended -- this was part of the

overall contingency plan that US Government had. Should Castro

ever be overthrowi, these people would be the nucleus to go into

Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

Now, Ministry of the Interior, is that a euphemism

for Security Agency?

A.

Well, in most countries of the world the Ministry of

Interior, unlike ours, is the security force, internal and.

You mean in terms of vears?

A.

Well, I would think that I would probably say from

about 1962, and I think the debriefings as such, of course --

¡we relied principally on the

airlift for the people coming out

and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did -- cut

off

about, I quess about 1970 or '71, in that timeframe --

I see.

A.

-- that stopped the flow of the refugees, so we just

terminated that part of the activity.

Well, in addition to debriefing refugees that came

in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any other

intelligence gathering functions --

A.

No.

In the community?

A.

Well, I can't give you a real yes of no to that. I

would suppose that there is an outside possibility they could

have been used to debrief people within the community, within

the Cuban community, but we had in the organization - all these

people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an

On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime staff employee and he

had a couple of assistants; including a secretary. These people

were directly under his control: Though the organization as it

was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,

but the chief. took his instructions from the On-site Case Officer.

Of course,

if these people went out and did something on

their own, they could do things we were not aware of, obviously.

You can't -- you know what they are doing during their eight or

ten hours that they are going to work everyday but once they

leave, we don't know what they are up to.

A.

Did they have CIA credentials?

No sir.

Did CIA levy any intelligence requirements upon these

people other than in their duties - in their debriefing

capacity, I should say?

A.

No. When . there were - obviously there was a

standard debriefing form that covered questions of intelligence

interest or a battle, you know, anything - economic questions,

morale, and this type of thing. When these questions, - when.

these people were cebriefed and the debriefer wrote up the

report, it would be sent from the AMOTS over to the Station.

If the debriefing report contained something of positive

intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer - well, not the

Case Officer but a staffer in the Station may or may not jot

down some additional requirements and. ask that that person be

recontacted and asked specific questions.

Now, in addition to debriefing, what else did this

smaller broup of AMOTS do for the Agency in the Miami area?

A.

This was their prime purpose.

CIA doesn't resettle Cuban emigres.

A.

What Agency is charged with that responsibility?

Health, Education and Welfare.

Does CIA play any role in that process?

A.

We may assist if we are. asked but the idea of the whole

airlift was having relatives here. for somebody to claim you when

you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the

Government, and normally when

these refugees came. in, they were

processed through the Center and then they had a place down

Biscayne Boulevard they called Freedom House and this was, of

course, all run by HEW, and they - if need be and they had to

stay overnight of stay several days, HEw would put them up and

care for them in Freedom House.

A.

They are in the Headquarters here. A great many of

them were really destroyed. It got to be rather comic. We

went down there several years ago just looking through the files

to see what kind of shape they were in and they had such great

information for intelligence value in there as a picture of a

gal who might be the daughter of a Cuban refugee who just won

a swinning meet. It got rather ridiculous. So ve purged those

files and took out that material, you know, which just didn't

have any pertinancy at all.

become nationalized out in California and your record of

nationalization wouldn't be reflected here in Washington for

two years. That is how far they are behind.

So I take it-

A.

So there is no central index you can go to. I mean,

there is a central index you can go to but it is. not current.

I take it, then, that there is a possibility that the

CIA has some files in Miami or here in Langley on Cubans who

A. :

Well -

D.

For example, let me

ask you this. Were any of these

files on Cubans who were

suspected or thought to be a possible

internal security problem?

A.

No. No. They dián't keep those types of files.

We

would simply task them with through your sources what do you

have on so and so. They would not be told the reason why we

wanted the information on anybody.

Well, I quess

it is difficult to

make generalizations about the kind of information that is in

those files?

A

Well, that is right.

So I guess I won't ask you to do so, but I want to ask

you this. I trust that there is the possibility that some of

these files do contain what you in the trade refer to as deroga-

tory information?

A.

I would assume so.

And that so much of them may - some of the subjects

of those files may now he American citizens?

A.

Right.

And finally I take it that no effort has been made to

study that particular situation?

A.

WEll, we did make an effort to do it at one time.

up the wall and, of course, I guess it was around - the

Government allowed a lot of this to go on for awhile but I guess

about 1965 or 1964 they got a little tired of it and they

started to tighten up.

I am sure the AMOTS were in part responsible for proposing

alerting us and in turn we alerted the enforcement agencies when!

there was going to be a raid against Cuba by one of these

militant groups.

A number of times raids were aborted, picked

up by the Coast Guard or Florida Coastal Patrol or the Bureau,

He was a boat manufacturer, small boats, but whether he ever

served any time or not I don't know.. I know he was convicted

but he was always walking around Miami when I was there. So

Group began?

A.

It began -- well, it began around June of '63.

Now, with particuiar reference to the last half of

1963, including whatever

period in June '43 may not have been

involved, were there a great many. Cubans in the southern United

States who were active in revolutionary fronts that were being

7

sponsored by the Agency?

Well you mean agency sponsored fronts?

9

Yes.

A.

The Agency subsidized these fronts in an effort to

11

12

have unity rather than these split factions, split anti-Castro

factions. Obviously the leaders of the fronts knew that the

13 | CIA was subsidizing. Supposedly the people that joined these

14

fronts did not know they were being subsidized by the Agency

- 5

or the li.s. Government.

But when you say "supposedly," does the fact appear

16

to be otherwise?

WEll, based on my experience with the Cubans and this

type of thing, and their penchant to talk, I would think that

it wouldn't take long for knowledge of any subsidy to surface

itself.

by the Agency also had activities or operations in New Orleans?

A.

I don't know if i can answer that, whether they had

the same functions. I know that

some funding arrangement for

subsidizing the organizations in Miami was carried out through

New Orleans.

I take it that Frank Sturgis was never an intermediary

for providing funds to the Cuban fronts?

The files that I have don't reflect it.

I think ve covered this already just a few minutes ago

but let me make sure that we have got it on the record.

I understood vou to say that it was your impression in 1963

that large numbers of Cuban exiles, Cuban peopie in the southern

United States, talker

about and believed that they were involved

'in the CIA sponsored activities. Is that true?

A.

That is richt.

Has it also your understanding and your impression

that there was a good deal of talk among this Cuban element in

the southern United States about plans or prospects for the

assassination of Fidel Castro?

À.

I would say no.

I don't think there was -- you have

got to remember that these

people were embittered. They lost

their homeland. their sossessions, they lost everything and theyi

blamed it all on one man.

I have done it twice that I recall and the most zecent

one was I guess -- I am just trying to think. Nell, it wasn't

too long ago hecause ve did have an inquiry and ve obtained the !

time and the attendance secords from the office of Finance which

showed that Howard Hunt was on sick leave on that day.

Q.

Was this just fairly recently?

A.

Yes.

I understood from what files I have seen, Mr.

Sturbitts, that the only records that were available from the

Office of Finance showed that he had had nine hours of sick leave

during the two-week pay period ending the 23rd of November but

that the records were not available as to how much sick leave

or annual leave had been taken on any particular day.

A.

Well -

Am I mistaken?

A.

As I recall, he was in a duty status one day and a

sick leave status the next day and back to duty the next

day.

I would have to check that with my Budget and Fiscal Officer.

He is the chan that got that for me..

We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement

we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time

they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens

which we promptly sent

not trace.

Watergate trial. Some of these allegations that came out

and I think they were carried in the Anderson column but we

made file checks and this type of thing. One particular

activity was supposed to

nave been carried out in Rockefeller

Center in New York and in turns out it was taken out of

context.

It was a training mission and -- training exercise.

These guys were being trained in surveillance in New York

and they were simply asted to go into a branch of the Manhatta!

- Chase Manhattan and is come back out and then they were

supposed to diagram the layout of the bank. And this to some

of them meant casing the sank when in fact it was just a

memory exercise.

With what frequency were those kinds of training

exercises conducted?

Well, whenever there was an - whenever it was felt

that these people, selected individuals, were to be trained

in trade craft.

?

And did their made craft training include such

things as surveillance?

Sure.

And break-ins?

No. Not break-ins. Nor surreptitious entry.

AS

said, in the case of this particular thing, it was misinter-

me what is in that outer office? What is the layout of it?

This is just for observation.

You stated earlier none of those allegations have

been proven. Have any of them been proved to your

satisfaction?

A

No. Ithink we disproved them to my satisfaction.

I take it you do not believe they took place other

than the training exercise?

A

oh, no. "o. I don't believe they did.

Do you know of any instances where members of that

group have broken in,

made any other type of illegal entry

in this country?

NO.

@ Have you ever been present at any discussions of

the legality or illegality of maintaining stations like the

liami Station within this country?

Legality?

310.

How about the propriety?

well, to my knowledge, that really never came up.

No one to my knowledge, has

ever questioned the legality of

the propriety of having the

Station.

There have been some allegations in the press and

elsewhere about possible misuse of Cuban exiles, members

of

that community, by the CIA. Are you aware of those?
