beach at Palm Beach, Florida on July 17, 1963, after
their boat had capsized, and upon interview, DUQUE
claimed he had left Miami on July 13, 1963 on a fishing

opposition to the CASTRO regime inside Cuba.

DUQUE also stated he has been attempting to -
raise money for this purpose both in the United States
and Puerto Rico and that he expected to continue ‘to do
so. He indicated that his success in this connection has
been relatively limited and that financial resources are
his principal problem.

: On June 23, 1963, Dr. OR
Coordinator of DUQUE's group. 2019-W. Flagler Terrace,
Miami.j ‘advised that DUQUE’ and his group are interested in
obtaining arms for their people in Cuba but to the best
of his knowledge, have no plans to make raids against
Cuba or against shipping off the coast of Cuba in the
immediate future. BOSCH claimed DUQUE has neither the
money nor equipment necessary for such operations, although
he is attempting to raise funds for the purchase of arms
for the Cuban underground,

BOSCH mentioned that just three or four days
previously, DUQUE:had been visited by representatives of
the Inmigration and Naturalization Service and presented
with a "Notice of Prevention of Departure," which, ac-
cording to BOSCH, limited DUQUE to travel within the area
of Dade County, BOSCH said that in view of this he did
not believe DUQUE was preparing to make an attack against
Cuba.
