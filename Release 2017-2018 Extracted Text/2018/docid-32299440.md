No information

which would substantiate the CIA report has been received

to date.

It is noteworthy, however, that as set out in

this report, DUQUE and a friend were picked up on the

beach at Palm Beach, Florida on July 17, 1963, after

their boat had capsized, and upon interview, DUQUE

claimed he had left Miami on July 13, 1963 on a fishing

trip. While DUQUE and his friend had some food supplies,

a rifle and a pistol, and a battery radio, it was not

believed they were lin any position to have set up a

broadcasting station, as this was not a transmitting

radio.

This does not preclude the possibility, however,

that DUQUE was en route to a rendezvous with another boat

for this purpose.

but that circumstances caused the meet-

ing to fail. (0)01

DUQUE also stated he has been attempting to

Fadvised that DUQUE and his group are interested in

obtaining arms for their people in Cuba but to the best

of his knowledge, have no plans to make raids against

Cuba or against shipping off the coast of Cuba in the

immediate future. BOSCH claimed DUQUE has neither the

money nor equipment necessary for such operations, although

he is attempting to raise funds for the purchase of arms

for the Cuban underground.

BOSCH mentioned that just three or four days

previously, DUQUE had been visited by representatives of

the Immigration and Naturalization Service and presented

with a "Notice of Prevention of Departure," which, ac-

cording to BOSCH, limited DUQUE to travel within the area

of Dade County, BOSCH said that in view of this he did

not believe DUQUE was preparing to make an attack against

Cuba.
