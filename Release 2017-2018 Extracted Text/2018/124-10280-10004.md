FRANK

TORINI,

also known as Frank/Sturgis,

is an American citizen who has been engaged in Cuban

revolutionary activities for the past five years.

My 1-3,

who is familiar with some phases of

activities in the Central Florida area,

furnished the

Information on September 5,

1963, regarding a meeting

Cuban

following

which

was held in Orlando, Florida,

on

August 24, 1963, and

which is set forth belor: Of

Among those at this meeting was ANTONIO VECIANA,

who mentioned that the Alpha 66 group in Los Angeles,

California, had purchased

a T-6 military-type alrcraft

for use in

anti-CASTRO raids on Cuba.

He said

was needed to transport the plane to

Florida and arm it

with, among other items, two .50 caliber machine guns.

VECIANA said they would

possibly fly the plane

from an undisclosed airstrip in Florida,

and that two

"Americans, reportedly familiar with this type of aircraft,

had offered their services, free of charge, to participate

in any raids conducted."

said one of the Americans is

supposed to have a

"Comanche" airplane, which he also offered.

However, VECIANA said they preferred to use the T-6, which

is faster and more maneuverable.

4

VECIANA also mentioned that Alpha

66 has a key,

with an airstrip, on which they have arms and

armunition

stored, but that

they hesitate to use it, as it is

allegedly

being watched by federal

authorities. Location of this key

was not mentioned.

ANTONIO VECIANA

is Treasurer of the SNFE - Alpha 66

organization.

On september 17, 1963, uN I made available informa

tion furnished by a Cuban

exile, who was a radio

nd who received this intermation from an untested confideni

roadcaster, 7S,

of the SNFE,

who is sometimes present at the meetings of this

Group. 5
