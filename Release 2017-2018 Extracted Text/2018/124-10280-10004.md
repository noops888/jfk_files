is an American citizen who has been engaged in
revolutionary activities for the past five year:

i MM T-3, who is familiar with some phases of Cuban
activities in the Central Florida area, furnished the following
information on September 5, 1963, regarding a meeting which

was held in Orlando, Florida, on August 24, 1963, and

which is set forth below: LA

Among those at this meeting was ANTONIO VECIANA,
who mentioned that the Alpha 66 group in Los Angeles,:
California, had purchased a T-6 military-type aircraft
for use in anti-CASTRO raids on Cuba. He said $3,000.00
was needed to transport the plane to Florida and arm it
with, among other items, two .50 caliber machine guns. a& A

VECIANA said they would possibly fly the plane
from an undisclosed airstrip in Florida, and that two
"Americans, reportedly familiar with this type of aircraft,
had offered their services, free of charge, to participate
in any raids conducted." He said one of the Americans is
supposed to have a “Comanche” airplane,. which he also offered.
However, VECIANA said they preferred to use the T-6,. which
is faster and more maneuverable.

VECIANA also mentioned that Alpha 66 has a key,
with an airstrip, on which they have arms and ammunition
stored, but that they hesitate to use it, as it is allegedly
being watched by fe al authorities. Location of this key.
was not mentioned, a

ANTONIO VECIANA is Treasurer of the SNFE ~- Alpha 66
organization. we tA

On September 17, 1963, MM T-2 made available informa-
tion furnished by a Cuban exile, who was[a radio broadcaster S)
and who received this information from an untested confidan
of the SNFE, who is sometimes present at the meetings of this
group. Ol ee,
