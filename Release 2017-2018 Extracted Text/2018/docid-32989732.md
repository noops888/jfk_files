Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)
62-117290

NOTE: This teletype confirms telephonic contact with Jackson
Office on 5/24/78.

Referenced teletype concerns information provided by these
informants regarding the whereabouts of White Hate subjects
Deavours Nix and Samuel Bowers at the approximate time of King's
assassination.

If informants are located and refuse HSCA interview, the
Committee will be advised. I£ informants agree to interview,
having them initiate contact with the HSCA is the best method of

handling this situation because we can avoid furnishing the HSCA
informants' identities.

On August 23, 1968, Mr. HARVEY A. KLINGEMAN and Mrs.
CLARA S. KLINGEMAN,owners, Indian Trail Restaurant, 507
Chestnut Street, Winnetka, Illinois, phone HI 6-1703,
residence 391 Linden, Winnetka, Illinois, phone HI 6-2932,

+ were interviewed jointly in the conference room at the Winnetka,
Illinois, Police Department, after being introduced to the
interviewing Agents by Chief DON DERNING (NA), Winnetka,
Illinois, Police Department. :

Theyadvised that on Tuesday, August 20, 1968, they
were contacted by WILLIAM BRADFORD HUIE, Hartselle, Akbama,
who is the author of "Three Lives For Mississippi". Mr. HUIE
was accompanied by Mr. (First Name Unknown ) HANSEN, who is
a photographer for "Look" magazine. Mr. HUIE exhibited
letters which he claimed were from JAMES EARL RAY and were
addressed to a Mississippi attorney. These letters were
purportedly given to HULE by the attorney. HUIE told them
that he had obtained all commercial rights to RAY's story
and for this he has agreed to underwrite the costs of RAY's
defense in the forthcoming murder trial in Memphis, Tennessee.
The aforementioned letters were writted on half sheets of
yellow legal foolscap and both of the KLINGEMANs stated that
they recognized the handwriting on these papers as that of the
subject RAY, whom they knew under the name of JOHN RAYNS. At
this point, the KLINGEMANs were exhibited several photographs
of the subject, JAMES EARL RAY, along with other photographs
and they both positively identified JAMES EARL RAY as a man
employed by them from May 3, 1967, to June 24,1967, as a
dishwasher and cook's helper. The KLINGEMANs verified the
foregoing statement by furnishing to the interviewing Agents
their payroll ledger sheet. A review of the ledger sheet
reveals the following information:

In addition, the KLINGEMANs also made available the
Enployee's Withholding Exemption Certificate made out in the
same name and address and Social Security Number as set forth
above, dated May 10,1968.

They also made available the following listed
payroll checks atl drawn on the Winnetka Trust and Savings
Bank bearing the identification in the upper left-hand
corner of Indian Trail Restaurant, Inc., 507 Chestnut Street,
Winnetka, Illinois, 60093, made out to either JOHN L. RAYNS
of JOHN RAYNS and signed by HARVEY A. KLINGEMAN. The checks
are endorsed by JOHN L. RAYNS or JOHN RAYNS, two of which have
the address 1648 Lunt, Chicago, underneath the signature.
These checks are as follows:

5357 $77.53 June 25, 1967

The foregoing checks total $664.34.

Mr. KLINGEMAN advised that to the best of his
recollection at this time, the last check, Number 5357, was
mailed to RAY's brother, name unrecalled, in Northbrook,
Illinois, at RAY's request since he left his employment
prior to receipt of the check, stating that he was going to
work on boats with his brother. As Mr. KLINGEMAN recalls,
he received a letter from RAY requesting that the pay due be
sent to his brother. :

HW 54985 DocId:32989732 Page 54



CG 44-1114

Both. of the KLINGEMANs characterized JAMES EARL
RAY as an excellent employee, quiet, attentive, prompt,
polite, a very good worker, but to their knowledge,
had no friends or visitors during the time of his
employment. They did recall that during the subject's
last week of employment, he received three or four phone
calls from a male individual who stted that he was RAY's brother.
They could not recall the individual's name,nor did they
believe that they would recognize this person's voice if they
heard it again.

In conversation with Mr. HUIE, the KLINGEMANs
received the following information on a confidential basis and
advised that they were rather reluctant to divulge it,
but felt that it was their duty as citizens. They requested
that this information bemintained on a confidential basis within
the FBI. They advised that they contacted Chief DERNING
because of his reputation and are now following his advice in
furnishing this information to the FBI:

Mr. HUIE sowed the KLINGEMANs letters from RAY in
which RAY listed employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant.
(It should be noted that this restaurant is an old, large,
upper class restaurant, of excellent reputation. Chief
DERNING advised that the KLINGEMANs themselves have an
excellent reputation within the community and that he holds
them in very high regard}. HUIE told them that RAY had
served seven years of a twenty-year sentence at Jefferson,
Missouri, prison, during which time he had eight visitors,
one of whom was his brother, however, HUIE did not identify
which one. Prior to his escape, RAY had stashed away
a razor, green prison trousers which had been dyed black, and
12 hersey bars in anticipation that he would have to go
without food for some time. ‘RAY also had $300 in his shoe.
He escaped in alred truck and walked to Chicago, Illinois,
from Jefferson City, Missouri, which tock him about eight
days. (The KLINGEMANs do recall that when the subject first
appered at the restaurant, his feet were swollen and that
their sister-in-law gave him two Ace bandages to use which he
returned three or four days later. This supposedly was
mentioned in the letter in HUIE's possession).

Thereafter, RAY read the advertisement in the

Tribune wherein the KLINGEMANs had advertised for help in the
restaurant. HUIE said that the subject in the letter

NW 54985 DoclId:32989732 Page 55



HW 54985 DocId:32989732 Page 56

CG 44-1114

mentioned that the employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant
was the "high point of his life".

HUIE mentioned that RAY had had only three jobs
in his life, one of which was in a shoe factory outside of
East St. Louis, Tllincis, which ws prior to his going to
prison the last time. He also said that during the time RAY
was employed at the restaurant, he was "tapped on the shoulder"
by an individual who recognized him and who threatened to
reveal his identity to the police and cause RAY's return to
Prison if he, RAY, did not work for this person. HUIE said
that RAY was given $1,200 during the initial contacts,by.the
alleged conspirators, and was ultimately paid $15,000, but
was due to receive more.

Again, according to HUIE, RAY was told to go to
Canada to investigate the difficulty of crossing the border.
Supposedly RAY made two trips through the Detroit Tunnel into
Canada. He also made a third trip to Canada, date and
sequence not given, and "was instructed'to obtain a 40-year-
old newspaper, get the names of the males born that dte,
and search the current phone directory for similar names.
He was then to surveil the individuals with similar names to
determine whether or not his physical description was
similar to theirs. Theréafter,he telephoned persons of his
like description, utilizing a pretext, and thereby found a manr
who had never applied for a passport. RAY then applied for a
passport in this name.

The KLINGEHANs advised that they were not sure that
they were furnishing this information in its proper
sequence, but that to the best of their recollection, the
information preceding and following was given to them in this
order by HUIE. Thereafter,RAY was given more money to H
purchase a Mustang which was to be driven to Acapulco, Mexico,
for the purpose of obtaining a tourist sticker. He then
drove through Mexico to the West Coast and hid out there to
receive further instructions from the other individuals in
the alleged conspiracy. HUIE stted that RAY was flown to
Atlanta from the West Coast, but the time was not right, there
was no action andbe was sent back to California. He was also
told to be in Mississippi at a certain time and place.
Supposedly Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was at a~- Holiday
Inn Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, when RAY was flown there.



os "eG 44-1114 ee 6 mE

Subsequently, RAY was given money to obtain binoculars
and a shotgun and was to go to Memphis to be somewhere at
3 p.m. in room 312 or¥3. Supposedly there were other
individuals who also came to this room and there was a
Negro male who purportedly calied KING out to the balcony.
According to HUIE, the actual murderer of KING was not RAY,
although RAY was present and at a later time Xprobably the trial)
RAY will identify the murderer. RAY did pick up the rifle, ran
to his car, and sped to a rendezvous in Atlanta, Georgia.
He was supposed to pick up a "bundle of money", however, the
conspirators did not appear. RAY allegedly spent several days
or hours at this apartment in Atlanta, Georgia,awaiting the
arrival of his "fellow conspirators".

According to HUIE, the plan was for RAY to go to
Mexico, but immediately fly north to throw off pursuit and
to steer all investigation to Mexico. However, since
the conspirators did not appear in Atlanta, RAY fled to Cardia
thereafter utilizing his knowledge to obtain a passport and
fled to England. : :

The KLINGEMANs advised that the rest of HUIE's story
substantially follows the newspaper accounts which appeared
after subject RAY's arrest in England. They did note that
HULE stated that. RAY did rob a bank in London because he
"got real low on money". HUIE at no time identified the
alleged fellow conspirators of RAY. He did swear the KLINGEMANs
to secrecy and told them that he would mail the "Look"
proofs on September 10,1968, and the story would be in the
November 10,1958, issue of Look magazine. Both Mr. and Mrs.
KLINGEMAN advised that they would make these proofs available to
te interviewing Agents for review.

The KLINGEMANs advised that RAY began working for
them as a dishwasher and because of his excellent attitude
was advanced to cook's helper. During the time he was in
their employ, they did not observe him in a car, nor did they
know him to own an automcbile. He had no visitors, he did
not wear glasses, he had no women friends, nor did he make
any advances toward the female personnel employed at the
restaurang and they noted that his hair was "less bushy" dating
the time he was at the restaurant than shown in the
photographs.

They are not sure how he came to work from his
apartment, but believe henight have beenrmet at the Eden's
Expressway by WILLIE PERRY and FRED BURNS, who were also
employees at the restaurant.

"CG 44-1114

\
His conduct was excellent and they cannot recall
him making any comments one way or another about members of
the Negro race and specifically no comments whatsoever con-
cerning MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. RAY made no reference’to his
previous employent, but did mention that he was in
Brimerhaven, Germany, during World War II. They advised that
when RAY received the phone calls during his last week of
employment he seemed to be disturbed and that his
concentration on his work was not as good as it usually was. .

They then recalled that according to HUIE, that when
JAMES EARL. RAY left England, he was going to Lisbon to get to
Africa, however, he was unable to do so which is when he returned
to England and held up a bank receiving about $200in loot. |
They again stated that the information furnished to them by
HUIE came fromJetters which RAY had written to his attorney, who
in turn turned them over to the author. Also Mr. KLINGEMAN
» stated that in one of the letters which he believed was to
the attorney from RAY, while he was in London, England, there
was a drawing identifying a location which appeared to be
Diversey Street and Sheffield Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.

At the conclusion of the interview, the Klingemans
again requested that this information be maintained in
confidence and expressed a willingness to co-operate with
the FBI in ay way possible. :
