The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Attorney General of the

Department of Justice

Washington, D. C.

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

that staff be provided access to the "informant files of all

informants within the Invaders during 1968 ...".

It is now

requested that the Memphis Field Office files

for these same informants be prepared for access by the staff.

While the Connittee feels that the procedure by which

was permitted access to the first

set of files was unacceptable'/

and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending future

discussions to arrange to broaden access, this procedure may

again be utilized.

It is my understanding that these files will be sanitized

only to the

extent necessary to protect the identity of the

informants.

Again, the Committee reStvlitthe right to request the

production of the identity of the informants involved if such

attention in seeing that these files are prepared

on a priority

is greatly appreciated.

Reterenced teletype concerns information provided by these

informants regarding the whereabouts of White Hate subjects

Deavours Nix and Samuel Bowers at the approximate time of King's

assassination.

If informants are located and refuse HSCA interview, the

Committee will be advised. If informants agree to interview,

having them initiate contact with the HSCA is the best method of

handling this situation because we can avoid furnishing the HSCA

informants' identities.

purportedly given to hull by the attorney. HUlE told them

that he had obtained all conmercial rights to RAY's story

and for this he has agreed to underwrite the costs of RAY's

defense in the forthcoming murder trial in Memphis, Tennessee.

The aforementioned letters were writted on half sheets of

yellow legal foolscap and both of the KLINGEMANs stated that

they recognized the handwriting on these papers as that of the

subject RaY, whom they knew under the name of JOHN RAYNS. At

this point, the KLINGEMANs were exhibited several photographs

of the subject, JAMES EARL RAY, along with other photographs

and they both positively identified JAMEs EArL RAY as a man

employed by them from May 3, 1967, to June 24,1967, as a

dishwasher and cook's helper. The KLINGEMANs verified the

foregoing statement by furnishing to the interviewing Agents

Mr. KLINGEMAN advised that to the best of his

recollection at this time, the last check, Number 5357, was

mailed to RAY's brother, name unrecalled, in Northbrook,

Illinois, at RAY's request since he left his employment

prior to receipt of the check, stating that he was going to

work on boats with his brother. As Mr. KLINGEMAN recalls,

he received a letter from RAY requesting that the pay due be

sent to his brother.

They did recall that during the subject's

believe that they would recognize this person's voice if they

heard it again.

In conversation with Mr. HUIE, the KLINGEMANS

received the following information on a

confidential basis and

advised that they were rather reluctant to divulge it,

but felt that it was their duty as citizens.

. They requested

that this information bemintained on a confidential basis within

the FBI.

They advised that they contacted Chief DERNING

because of his reputation and are now following his advice in

furnishing this information to the FBI:

MI. HUIE sowed the KLINGEMANs letters from RAY in

which RAY listed employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant.

(It should be noted that this restaurant is an old, large,

upper class restaurant, of excellent reputation. Chief

DARNING advised that the KLINGEMANs themselves have an

excellent reputation within the community and that he holds

them in very high regard). HUIE told them that RAY had

served seven years of a twenty-year sentence at Jefferson,

Missouri, prison, during which time he had eight visitors,

one of whom was his brother, however, HUlE did not identify

Prior to his escape,

RAy had stashed away

a razor, green prison trousers which had been dyed black, and

12 hersey bars in anticipation that he would have to go

without food for some time.

also had $300 in his shoe.

He escaped in abred truck and walked to Chicago, Illinois,

crom Jefferson City, Missouri, which took him about eight

days.

(The KLINGEMANs do recall that when the subject first

appered at the restaurant, his teet were swollen and that

their sister-in-law gave him two Ace bandages to use which he

nentioned in the letter in HUl!!'

returned three or four days lates possession osedly was

Thereafter, RAY read the advertisement in the

Tribune wherein the KLINGEMANs had advertised for help in the

restaurant.

HUIE

said that the subject in the letter

. CE

mentioned that the employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant

was the "high point of his life".

HUTE mentioned that RAY had had only three jobs

in his life, one of which was in a shoe factory outside of

East St. Louis, Illincis, which is prior to his going to

He also said that during the time RAY

was employed at the restaurant, he was "tapped on the shoulder"'

by an individual who recognized him and who threatened to

reveal his identity to the police and cause RAY's return to

Prison if he, RAY, did not work for this person. HUlE said

that RaY was given $1,200 during the initial contacts, by. the

alieged conspirators, and was ultimately paid $15,000, but

Again, according to HUIE, RAY was told to go to

Canada to investigate the difficulty of crossing the border.

Supposedly RAY made two trips through the Detroit Tunnel into

Canada. He also made a third trip to Canada, date and

sequence not given, and "was instructed' to obtain a 4)-year-

old newspaper, get

the names of the males born that cae,

and search the current phone directory for similar names.

He was then to surveil the individuals with similar names to

determine whether or not his physical description was

similar to

theirs.

Thereafter, he telephoned persons of his

like description,

utilizing a pretext, and thereby found a man-

who had never applied for a passport. RAY then applied for a

passport in this name.

The KLINGtiANs advised that they were not sure that

they were furnishing this information in its proper

sequence, but that to the best of their recollection, the

information preceding and following was given to them in this

therealter, hay was given more money to

for has papostand untan ins to burast en cheapulet, Mexico,

drove through Mexico to the West Coast and hid out there to

receive further instructions from the other individuals in

the alleged conspiracy.

HUIt stated that RAY was flown to

Atlanta Irom the west coast, but the time was not right, there

was no action andhe was sent back to California.

He was also

told to be in Mississippi at a certain time and place.

Supposedly Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was at a- Holiday

Inn Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, when RAY was flown there.

Subsequently, RAY was given money to obtain binoculars

and a shotgun and was to go to Memphis to be somewhere at

3 p.m. in room 312 or 313.

Supposedly there were other

individuals who also came to this room and there was a

Negro male who purportedly called KING out to the balcony.

According to HUIE, the actual murderer of KING was not RAY,

although RAY was present and at a later time (probably the trial)

RAY will identify the murderer. RAY did pick up the rifle, ran

to his car, and sped to a rendezvous in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was supposed to pick up a "bundle of money"

however,

conspirators did not appear.

the

RAY allegedly spent several days

or hours at this apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, awaiting the

arrival of his "fellow conspirators"

According to HUIE, the plan was for RAY to go to

Mexico, but immediately fly north to throw off pursuit and

to steer all investigation to Mexico. However,

since

the conspirators did not appear in Atlanta, RAY fled to Calada

thereafter utilizing his knowledge to obtain a passport and

fled to England.

The KLINGEMANs advised that the rest of HUIE's story

substantially follows the newspaper accounts which appeared

after subject RAY's arrest in England. They did note that

HUle stated that RAY did rob a bank in London because he

"got real low on money".

HUIt at no time identified the

alleged fellow conspirators of RAY. He did swear the KLINGEMANS

to secrecy and told

them that he would mail the "Look"

Both Mr. and Mrs.

te interviewing Agents for review.

The KLINGEMANs advised that RAY began working for

them as a dishwasher and because of his excellent attitude

was advanced to cook's helper. During the time ha was in

their employ, they did not observe him in a car, nor did they

know him to own an automobile.

he had no visitors, he did

not wear glasses, he had no women friends, nor did he make

any advances toward the female personnel employed at the

restaurang and they noted that his hair was

"less bushy" during

the time he was at the restaurant than shown in the

photographs.

They are not, sure how he came to work from his

apartment, but believe hemight have beenimet at the Eden's

Expressway by WILTIE PERRY and FRED BURNS, who were also

employees at the restaurant.

His conduct was excellent and they cannot recall

him making any comments one way or another about members of

the Negro race and specifically no comments whatsoever con-

cerning MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. RAY made no referense to his

previous employent, but did mention that he was in

Brimerhaven, Germany, during World War II. They advised that

when RAY received the phone calls during his last week of

employment he seened to be disturbed and that his

concentration on his work was not as good as it usually was. •

They then recalled that according to HUlE, that when

JAMES EARE RAY left England, he was going to Lisbon

to get to

Africa, however, he was unable to do so which is when he returnec

co ingland and neld up a bank receiving about s200 in loot.

They again stated that the information furnished to them by

HUIE came from letters which RAY had written to his attorney, who

in turn turned them over to the author. Also Mr. KLINGEMAN

stated that in one of the letters which he believed was to

the attorney from RAY, while he was in London, Ingland, there

was a drawing identifying a location which appeared to

Diversey Street and Sheffield Avenue in Chicago, Ilinois.

At the conclusion of the interview, the Klingemans

again requested that this information be maintained in

confidence and expressed a willingness to co-operate with

the "Bl in ay way possible.
