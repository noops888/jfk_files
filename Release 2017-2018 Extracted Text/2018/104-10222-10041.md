Subject is a virtual walking encylupedia on ‘tue, history, customs
and sonior personalities of Victnam, io has boen associated with this
area on and off over the period of the last 19 years, During this
tine he has developed lasting friendships with many individuals who
are now in high positions of power within tho government, These
contacts are of considerable importanco to the Station in its intelli-~
gence appreciation of the situation and in the coordination of opera-
tional activities on a discreet basis with those high personalities,

He is a highly
motivated and dedicated officer to whom considerations of personal
convenience and safety aro always socond to his determination to °
achievo whatever mission is given to him,

On the negative sido, his written and oral presentation, while
showing some improvement over the previous report, still necds
additional improvement, Ho has: no supervisery responsibllities at

> the prosont timo and therefore is not rated on that score, Ho
exhibits a good sense of cost consciousness in utilization of man

power, materiel and funds.

HAS JUDGED. THAT HIS GEST UTILIZATION HAS GEEN AS A REPRESENTATIVE

CREASING SKILL AND FAMILIARITY IN THE INTRICACIES OF, KUBARK STAFF
WORK, BOTH AT THE. INTER-STATION LEVEL AND THE [NTGA-MISSION LEVEL.
THIS IS A NEW CAPACITY FOR SCHWICKRATH WHO HAS MERETOFORE BEEN
KNOWN AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION OFFICER. SCHWICKRATH HAS PER=
FORMEO THESE NEW OUTIES WITH CONSIDERABLE FINESSE DESPITE A VERY
RAPID BUILOUP OF PARAMILITARY ASSETS WITHIN VIETNAM AND AN EXTREMELY
FLUID COMMAND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE U.S, MILITARY

_ BY CINCPAC IN ilAWAIT TO RECOMMEND PROCEOURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF
A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT INVOLVING A YEAR-LONG TURNOVER GF

CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ASSETS IN VIETNAM FROM THE STATION TO MACV.
SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE AT THAT CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE CON@

FUTURE ROLE IN CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ACTIVITIES. AT THE SAME TIME
SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUCH ‘AS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE, HARMONIOUS
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KUBARK, CINCPAC AND MACV.

Ts 1 HAVE PERSONALLY FOUND SCHWICKRATH TO BE AN INVALUABLE
MEMBER OF OUR STAFF WITH AN TNOISPENSABLE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE ANO
BACKGROUND ON SOUTH VIETNAM ANO ON ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO

SUBJECT: Employment of Lou Conein

1, At my request, General Langdale has quietly checked
on the atatua of Lou Conein's retirement from the Army. He is
Presently in Iran and is slated for return héme and retirement in
August, He has made an effort to return sooner but the Iranian.
Government protested that it would be an act of bad faith (apparently,
he is doing a good Job with them). ‘

2, At the moment, Gonein belongs to ACSI and Lansdale
focle that any move on onr part to accelerate his return would be
misinterpreted, or perhaps I should say correctly interpreted,
by ACSI, Iam getting his addross and will establish contact -with
him by personal letter. Lansdale feels that Conein is very anxious

to come back to work for the Agency.
