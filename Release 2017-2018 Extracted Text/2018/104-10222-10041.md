IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN STRICT PERSONAL

HE IS ANDIN TU MNY GIETNAMESE BOTH IN

THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AS HAVING BEEN ENGAGEO IN VARIUUS

GENCE ACTIVITIES IN VIFINIM SINCE 1545.

IN ADUITION,

HAS JUDGED. THAT HIS BEST UTILIZATION HAS BEEN AS A REPRESENTATIVE

OF THE CHIEF OF STATION IN VARIOUS COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND LIAISONS

WHERE IT WAS NECESSARY HE DE IDENTIFIED AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE

IT WOULD DE BOTH IMPOSSIGLE AND COUNTER-PROOUCTIVE IN

SCHWICKRATH'S CASE TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE COMPLETELY HIS AFFILIATION

WITH KUBARK.

DURING HIS CURRENT TOUR, SCHWICKRATH HAS ACQUIRED IN

CREASING SKILL AND FAMILIARITY IN THE INTRICACIES OF KUBARK STAFF

WORK, BOTH AT THE INTER-STATION LEVEL AND THE INTGA-MISSION LEVEL.

THIS IS A NEW CAPACITY FOR SCHWICKRATH WHO HAS MERETOFORE BEEN

KNOWN AS A VERY AGGRESSIVE ACTION OFFICER.

SCHWICKRATH HAS PER=

FORMED THESE NEW DUTIES WITH CONSIDERABLE FINESSE DESPITE A VERY

RAPID BUILDUP OF PARAMILITARY ASSETS WITHIN VIETNAM AND AN EXTREMELY

FLUID COMMAND RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMANDER OF THE U.S. MILITARY

ASSISTANCE COMMAND, VIETNAM.

IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT SCHWICKRATH

NAS THE ONLY STATION REPRESENTATIVE IN A RECENT CONFERENCE CONVOKED

BY CINCPAC IN ¡AWAII TO RECOMMEND PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF

A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT INVOLVING A YEAR-LONG TURNOVER OF

CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ASSETS IN VIETNAM FROM THE STATION TO MACV•

SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE AT THAT CONFERENCE RESULTED IN THE CON

FERENCE'S ADOPTING ALL STJIVON RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPECT TO ITS

FUTURE ROLE IN CIVILIAN IRREGULAR ACTIVITIES.

THE SAME TIME

SCHWICKRATH'S PERFORMANCE WAS SUCH AS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE, HARMONIOUS

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN KUBARK, CINGPAC AND MACV..

I HAVE PERSONALLY FOUND SCHWICKRATH TO BE AN INVALUABLE

OUR STAFF WITH AN INDISPENSABLE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND

BACKGROUND ON SOUTH VIETNAM AND ON ALL MATTERS PERTAINING TO

GUERRILLA WARFARE.

IT IS A DISTINCT PLEASURE TO HAVE HIM WORKING

HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE STATION.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FE Division

SUBJECT:

Employment of Lou Conein.

1. At my request, General Lanadale has quietly checked

on the status of Lou Conoin's retirement from the Army, He la

presently in Iran and is alated for return himo and retirement in

• August. He has made an effort to return sooner but the Iranian.

Government protestd that it would be an act of bad faith (apparently,

he la doing a good job with them).

2. At the moment, Conein belongs to ACSI and Lanedale

foole that any move on our part to accelerate his return would be

misinterpreted, or perhaps I should say correctly interpreted,

by ACSI. I arn getting his addross and will establish contact with

him by personal letter.

Lansdale feels that Conein is very anxious

to come back to work for the Agency,
