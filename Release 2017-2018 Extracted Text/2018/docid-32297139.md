flying lessons, and ALPIZAR said he told CANTILLO he
would be willing to give him lessons provided he could
make appropriate arrangements at some local airport
for obtaining a plane for this purpose. 4

Miami files reflect that AMADO CANTILLO HUGUET
was born 8/8/38 in Cuba, and INS memo dated 9/20/63
reflected that his name had been placed on a list of
persons who had been served with "Notice of Prevention
of Departure." This memo reflected that CANTILLO had
70 hours flying time, but no pilot's. license. -CANTILLO
is a former purser on Cubana Airlines, and requested
political asylum on 10/10/60.

ALPIZAR said that

On 3/22/65, ALPIZAR advised he had not yet
j heard. from CANTILLO as to whether or not BOSCH provided
him with the $300.00,

j It is to be noted that on 3/21/65, the MIRR

i held a rally in Dinner Key Auditorium. MM 635-S, who

: attended this rally, has advised that about 4,000 people
were present, and it appeared that a considerable amount
of money, possibly several thousands, were collected by

‘ BOSCH during the rally.

The above information pertaining to CANTILLO
will not be reported in a form suitable for dissemination
until more specific information is obtained concerning
further developments.

In the event BOSCH does decide to utilize the
services of CANTILLO, ALPIZAR feels that he is in an

: excellent position to provide information concerning
| BOSCH's plans through CANTILLO. :
