CANTILLO has requested ALPIZAR to give him

flying lessons, and ALPIZAR said he told CANTILLO he

would be willing to give him lessons provided he could

make appropriate arrangements at some local airport

for obtaining a plane for this purpose.

ALPILAR said that CANTILLO has been working

Miami files reflect that AMADO CANTILLO HUGUET

reflected that his name

had been placed on a list of

persons who had been served with "Notice of Prevention

This memo reflected that CANTILLO had

70 hours flying time, but no pilot's license. CANTILLO

is a former purser on Cubana Airlines, and requested

political asylum on 10/10/60.

On 3/22/65, ALPIZAR advised he had not yet

heard from CANTILLO as to whether or not BOSCH provided

him with the $300.00.

It 1s to be noted that on 3/21/65, the MIRR

held a rally in Dinner Key Auditorium.

were present, and it appeared that a considerable amount

of money, possibly several thousands, were collected by

BOSCH during the rally.

The above information pertaining to CANTILLO

will not be reported in a form suitable for dissemination

until more specific information is obtained concerning

further developments.

In the event BOSCH does decide to utilize the

services of CANTILLO, ALPIZAR feels that he is in an

excellent position to provide information concerning

BOSCH's plans through CANTILLO.
