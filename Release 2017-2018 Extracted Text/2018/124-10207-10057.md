WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 673-C advised that the Lucayan Hotel, owned

by LOUIS CHESLER, a multimillionaire of Canada and the

United States, has been granted a license to operate a

gambling casino at Grand Bahamas Island and that the

Jack Tarr Hotel, who operates the Grand Bahamian Club

on the same island, is making preparations, indicating

a gambling license will be issued sometime in the near

future.

He stated some individuals are contacting

the latter representatives in the Bahama Islands concerning

gambling equipment.

MM 752-PCI stated he received information that

the United States racket elements will not operate or

have any interest in the Bahama gambling casinos, as there

were specific items in the license which require the casinos

to employ European help. He said he heard MIKE MCLANEY and

RICHARD MELVIN have been putting out "feelers" relative to

the Bahama gambling situation.

MM 509-C-TE advised the hoodlum element at Miami

Beach have been talking about the forthcoming Bahama gambling

prospects, but nothing positive has resulted as the

Lucayan Beach Hotel is still under construction. He

related it is generally; felt that some of the hoodlums

in the Miami area will be employed in the casinos or hotels

before next year.

According to his sources WILLIAM

G. BISCHOFF (Miami file 92-98) is presently in the Bahama

Islands, looking over the possibilities and situation.

He said most of the hoodlums feel that their element will

have some interest because of the close association of

LOU CHESLER with ALLIE HARRIS, MICHAEL COPPOLA and others.

He pointed out that LOU CHESLER's daughter married ALLIE

HARRIS'

son.

This source stated the racket element is

aware of the alleged restrictions placed on the issuance

of a gambling casino license in the Bahama Islands but

feel that may be just on the surface and that their

contacts will see that they are taken care of.

MM 509-C-TE and MM 665-C have stated some rumors

have begun to circulate concerning transportation by air

and boat to the Bahama Islands. MM 673-C has stated he

heard some comment that PETE DE MET, of Coral Gables, and

WILBUR CLARK, of Las Vegas, have been talking about

purchasing some airplanes.

MM 665-C stated a boat owner

at West Palm Beach, Florida, who operated a barge service

some years ago between Key West and Cuba and Puerto Rico

has been talking about establishing a commuter type boat

service from West Palm Beach to the Bahama Islands.
