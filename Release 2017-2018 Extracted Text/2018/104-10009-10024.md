MICHOFILE

I. A Paris correspondent of Newsweek, Ray Sokolov, told RODIGAST he had the

assignment from his home office to.try to track down the manuscript of the Manchester

book on Kennedy's assassination.

Roped that it was now in the hande of a French

ublisher for translation, and thatthe would be able to get hold of it at least

temporarily, because Newsweek understands that Jacqueline Kennedy was withdrawing

the book, at least temporarily, perhaps to insist on certain cuts.

2. RODIGAST checked locally and learned that the book's French rights had been

sold by a London literary agent Gorall of Intercontinental Literary Agency (phone

COVent Garden 3181), jointly to|two French publishers, Editions Robert Laffont and

Editions Stock, who

were going to publish it.

But they do not have a text, and only

one person, Jean Rosenthal of Bittons Laffont, has had a significant amount of text

In his hands.

Andre Bay of Editions Stock said he felt that the Kennedy family was

going to withdraw the book for serious cuts for political reasons.

3. Bay'a ulte warks for Editions Arthaud, whict will soon peblish Mark Lane's

Rush to Judgment. Lane will be in Paris (probably very shortly) to appear on a

French television program dealing with the Kennedy assassination.

The French

publisher thinks Lane's book (which describes the 14 persons who had died violently

since the assassination, all of whom were key witnesses) 1a quite factual.

Lane is

also reportedly Involved in the Bertrand Russell mock trial, but the French publisher

does not think the television appearance will deal with this.
