SUBSECE: Gerald P. Hemming, Jv. Hoves to

Uperaciuus

i to Engage in Anti-Castro

1. Gerald Patrick Hemming, Jr. (erroneously referred to in CC-A(5)-3,170,536
as Jexrcy P. Henning, Jr.) informed Hendrickson of the Los Angeles Fieli Office
hat he moving to Miami, Florida and would arrive there on
ving stated that he was going to contact Jimay Gantry, 952 S.W. 22
8, Miami, Florida (felephone: FRanklin 4-3255) and that these two
going to proceed with a plan of action aimed at orgainizing a
professionals" (experienced revolutionaries) who would attempt to
in veconnaissance operations on the mainland of Cuba via paracinic
either light plane or water pick-ups. Hemming also stated he w
do what he could in Miami to attempt to unite the anti-Castro forces chore z
also to lessen the influznce of a number of "mercenaries" who had j
of these movements and were doing it more harm than good while ble
much of the available money.

2. The available background information on Hemmiag. was fural
LA-23939 (00-A(S)-3,170,536). Some additional information is incl
the attached Application for Conmission or Warrant Rank, US Navy ox Nav
Resecve, filled out by Hemming during his tour with the US Narine Corps and
3 Jun 58. Henming also claims to have been unofficially ch
on nemerous aircraft while serving with tho Cuban Air Force paves
half ef 1930 including the L-20, ¥-47, AT-5, Cessna 170 and
Bh: do aoe have a US corn ial ox private piloc Lice
repo! ily waintained an interest in parachuting during his
Los Angeles (September 1960-Match 1961), and claimed to have Jumped ac keass
once a moath with one of the local parachute and skydiving clubs

3, The above information is passed on because it appears likely that the
Agency may wish either (1) to make certain that no amateur reconnaissance
operations directed at Cuba are undertaken, or (2) in one way or another to
guide such activities to maximize their usefulness.

4. On the basis of several debriefing sessions with Henuing, wendrickson
is inclined to believe that Hemming is both sincere and serious in his de
to assist the US Government, provided that this can be accomplished through
his continuing to act as a “soldier of fortune", It is always possible, o. the
other haad, that he is still loyal to the Cuban Government aad at soma future
date will attempt to embarrass the US.

5. The infoxmation which Hemming furnished during his stay in Los Aagcles
was disseminated in the following reports:

00-B-3,169,985 (Evaluated 5, 1 & 6, 3)
3,169,982 ( " 3, 1 & 6, 3)
