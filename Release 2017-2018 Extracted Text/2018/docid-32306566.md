GIANCANA, AKa.

ReBuairtel to New York, co all offices, dated 2/1/61.

Review of file on GIANCANA reflects: (1) He is

not the subject of a substantive case and no process is out-

standing against him. U

(2) Investigation to date has not revealed any

vulnerable areas wherein a violation within the Bureau's

jurisdiction may be established.

A faint possibility exists

wherein GIANCANA, an ex-convict who travels extensively in

interstate commerce, may carry a firearm. All offices who

cover territory where GIANCANA travels have been alerted to

this possibility. y

(3) The area of Internal Revenue violation would

appear to be the most feasible one in that investigation has

Vegas gambling casinos, in motels in the Chicago area, and

in the juke box and coin machine field. The exact amount

of these investments have not been determined to date,

and

investigation is directed toward ascertaining GIANCANA'S

financial activity with particular reference to the identity

of the individual or individuals who channelize

Of GIANCANA.

JFK Law 11(a)

Infornation has

lieutenant, WILLIAM DADDANO, to be involved in the operation of

the West Suburban Scavenger

service.

These relatively new

companies are presently fighting the Chicago Scavenger

Association in obtaining new customers and it is noted that

most of the new accounts represent hoodlum controlled night-

clubs and restaurants. U

GIANCANA 1s allegedly the number one men of the so-called

Chicago Syndicate.

If this is true, then he necessarily controls

all investments of Syndicate moneygained from both illicit and

legitimate activity.

One phase of the investigation on GIANCANA

has been directed to the identities of individuals in a position

to indicate positively GIANCANA's influence and identification

of Syndicate, sic GIANCANA's controlled enterprises.
