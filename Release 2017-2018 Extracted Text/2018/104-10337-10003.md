Dear Mr. Lesar:

This is further to our letter dated 11 June 1992 regarding
your 18 May 1992 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for.
"all records reviewed by the Historical Review Group" regarding
“the assassination of President John F. Kennedy."

As you are aware, the Director of Central Intelligence
has made the decision to have all of the previously withheld
John F. Kennedy documents reviewed under the CIA's Historical
Review Program. Once the review has been completed, we will
provide you with whatever CIA records are released. However,
because of the volume of material involved, we cannot tell you
at this time how long the review will take.

As a matter of administrative discretion, fees will not be
assessed in this particular instance.

Meanwhile, we will appreciate your patience while we
complete the review of the material referred to above.

DECLARATION OF JOHN F. PEREIRA
CHIEF, HISTORICAL REVIEW GROUP

——____CENTRAL_INTELLIGENCE AGENCY __
I, JOHN F. PEREIRA, hereby declare and say:

1. I am the Chief of the Historical Review Group (HRG) of
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA or Agency). I have held
this position since the HRG was established in April, 1992. My
responsibilities include management of the Historical Review
Program, supervising the staff of the HRG, and directing
coordination of the review process with both Agency components
and other agencies.

2. %I make the following statements based upon my personal
knowledge, and upon information made available to me in my
official capacity. I submit this declaration in response to
the Plaintiff's Motion To Compel Defendants To Reprocess All
Records At Issue In This Case. ,

3. The Agency's Historical Review Program was established

by the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) to make



13-00000

significant historical information available to the public
without damage to the national security interests of the United
States. The Program operates pursuant to the policies and
procedures approved by the DCI on April 28, 1992 and to be
published in Agency regulation. HR 70-14. Pursuant to these
policies and procedures, the Agency will transfer records

declassified and approved for release under the Program to the

“National Archives and Records Administration for public use.

4. The HRG i's responsible for the déclassification review
of records under the Program in accordance with the policies
and procedures approved by the DCI and additional guidelines
that may be promulgated by the Director, Center for the Study
of Intelligence, with the approval of the DCI. The HRG is
required to consult with the Agency Archivist and responsible
directorate and DCI area Information Review Officers during the
declassification- review process. The policies and procedures ~*~ pith
prescribe an intra-agency appellate procedure by which Agency
components may appeal determinations by the HRG that certain
records or portions of records qualify for declassification
under the Program. The final appellate authority regarding
declassification decisions under the Program is the DCI.

5. Under the Historical Review Program, individual
documents will be released in full, withheld in full, or
released in part.. When a document cannot be released in full,
the HRG will make an effort to sanitize the document by
deleting those portions that may not be declassified, or that

2


13-00000

may not be made public for other lawful reasons. However,
under the policies and procedures approved by the DCI, efforts
to sanitize documents will be made only when the effort will
not unduly slow the pace of the review, will not obscure the
record's essential significance, and will not distort the
document's bibliographical identity. Documents that cannot be

sanitized according to these criteria will be withheld in full

under the Program.

6. The first” group of records to be reviewed under the
Program has been selected by the DCI. He has directed the HRG
to review for declassification under the Program all CIA
records related to the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy. The HRG is presently reviewing these materials as a
priority matter. However, the HRG is also reviewing materials
relating to other matters of historical interest. The
materials relating to the assassination of President Kennedy
comprise approximately 63 boxes of documents and one box
containing 72 or 73 reels of microfilmed documents. We
estimate that the total number of pages involved to be
approximately 250,000 to 300,000. We estimate that
approximately 27 percent are documents originated by other
government agencies with which the HRG will need to coordinate
before declassifying or sanitizing these documents.

7. %. currently estimate that the HRG will take
approximately six to twelve months to review the documents
related to the assassination of President Kennedy. This time

3



13-00000

period does not include the time it will take to coordinate
other-agency documents with their originating agencies. My
estimate also does not include the time period for any appeals
that Agency components may initiate regarding decisions by the

HRG to declassify documents.

I declare, under ‘penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is true

and correct.

Executed this “rt day of July 1992.

Washington, D.C. 20005

F92-1267

Dear Mr. Judge:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your 14 August 1992
letter wherein you requested an amendment of your earlier
request (F92-1267) by adding to the original query the
following:

"1)[{llists or indexes of all materials concerning
Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy
that have been released under the provisions of the FOIA...

2){l]ocation and hours and terms of public access to the
FOIA-required reading room for such documents.

3)[a] copy of all documents on the topics mentioned above
that have been declassified under the Historical Review Program
but not transferred to NARA for public availability" [with the
exception of the 124 pages of material in the Oswald
pre-assassination file which you indicated that you have
obtained].

4){a]n annual list of all documents declassified under
the Historical Review Program and transferred to the NARA when
such a list is compiled.*

This request for additional information has been assigned
a separate reference number, F92-1724, and all future
correspondence with respect to the additional information
requested will be addressed accordingly.

With respect to Item 1 of your request, enclosed are
machine printouts listing previously released documents on the
subjects of John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald. Please
review the printouts bearing in mind that there may be



13-00000

duplicates, check the items you want, return the printouts to
us, and we will gladly reproduce the items you choose for a
cost of ten cents per page less the first 100 pages to which
you are entitled free of charge. A copy of our schedule of
fees is also enclosed for your information.

With respect to Item 2 of your request, this agency offers
its reading room in those instances where documents have been
released but have yet to be indexed in our system of previously
released material. The material you have requested has been
indexed and the printouts are enclosed for your personal use.
For your information, however, the reading room is located in
Rosslyn and is open Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to
5 p.m. We do request that appointments be made at least two
weeks in advance.

With respect to Item 3 of your request, other than the —
pages of material which you have received, no additional
information has been declassified under the Historical Review
Program at this time. However, this office has been informed
that it is expected that the review of six linear feet of
material from the Oswald file will be complete and subsequently
transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA) within a month for availability to the public.

We are unable to assist you with Item 4 of your request as
we are unable to accept a request for material which does not
exist. As we advised you on 29 June 1992 with respect to your
F92-1267 request, we have been advised that no such lists have
been compiled to date, but that the Agency does intend to
publish an annual index through the Historical Review Program
which will identify CIA documents released in whole or in part
during the preceding year and which were subsequently
transferred to NARA for availability to the public. We are
uncertain as to when such an index will be compiled and,
therefore, are unable to assist you with that portion of your
request at this time.

With respect to your request for a fee waiver, since the
material listed on the enclosed printouts has been previously
released to numerous requesters and is already in the public
domain, its re-release would not contribute significantly to
the public understanding of the operations and activities of
the United States Government. Therefore, your request for a
fee waiver is denied and you will be required to pay copying
costs as described above.

Meanwhile, we trust that the information provided above
and the enclosed material have satisfied your request.

This is to acknowledge receipt of your 26 May 1992 letter,
wherein you requested documents from a machine printout provided
to you on 24 September 1991 in response to your 31 August 1991
request for additional documents pertaining to the
assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Enclosed are(S¢ \gome of) documents you selected consisting
of 67 pages of material. Mice you have already received the
first 100 pages to which you are Soe free of charge as
a requester in the “all other" category, at ten cents per page,

pages that you received on 24 September is $8.40. Therefore,
please send your check or money order to me made payable to the
Treasurer of the United States citing Reference No. F91~-1465 to
ensure proper credit to your account.

Also enclosed is one page of the printout*that you
returned to us wherein you requested the material highlighted
in yellow consisting of 153 pages. We are unable to locate
this material which was originally input into our system of
previously released material as a batch of documents rather
than individual documents. This material ha&S recently been
reviewed for duplication and input by individual document.
Therefore, we are enclosing the most current machine printout
of previously released material which should contain the
material by document versus subject. If you wish documents
from the current printout, please check the items you want,
return the printout to us, and we will reproduce the items you
choose for a cost of ten cents per page. Please accept our
apology for this inconvenience.

"documents now being processed for release as mentioned this
month by Director Gates during his testimony before the Senate
Government Operations Committee on 12 May 1992," the Director
of Central Intelligence has made the decision to have all of
the previously withheld John F. Kennedy documents reviewed
under the CIA's Historical Review Program. Once the review has
been completed, the material will be transferred to the National

NOTE: Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

FROM: W. George Jameson
Chief, Litigation Division, OGC

SUBJECT: Coordination of Document Het eg ings
Ongoing Litigation PECAETO}

pet —

1. This is a follow-up to our discussion of 25 September,

“in connection with the Cahn case, regarding the need for prior

coordination between OGC and CSI when materials under
historical review are also the subject of ongoing litigation.
There seems to have been some confusion over the release of
material to the National Archives last week, and I agree that
we should ensure a mutual understanding about how the process
will work in the future.

2. As I indicated, it is essential that OGC review, prior
to release, the Agency's determination to withhold material
reviewed under the Historical Review Program (HRP) if the
material is the subject of ongoing litigation.. I understand
your concern that the HRP material be reviewed and, if
declassified, released as quickly as possible in order to
implement the DCI‘s mandate. My objective is to ensure the
legal sufficiency of the Agency/HRP position, as well as to
address any inconsistencies in the positions taken by other
components on material involved in the litigation.

3. It is clear that there will need to be further
discussion about coordinating releases under FOIA and the HRP
to sort out how the process should work. For example, it has
been Agency policy in connection with FOIA requests and related
litigation to avoid piece-meal releases whereby some material
is released before the remaining information that is subject to
the request has been processed. This may changé in light of
recommendations coming out of Ed Cohen's task Force, but it
would be useful to discuss how the HRP would like to operate in
light of this policy.

4. I am confident that these procedural issues can be
worked out to our mutual satisfaction and will contact John

Pereira and Jack Wright, the FOIA and Privacy Coordinator, to
try to establish some ground rules for the future.

DCI/IRO

FROM: Robert J. Eatinger, Jr.
Assistant General Counsel
Litigation Division, OGC

SUBJECT: James _H. Lesar v. CIA, No. 92-2215 (D.D.C.),
Case Dismissed Without Prejudice, F91-1334

1. During a status call today to discuss the subject
Freedom of Information Act case, the judge, unexpectedly,
dismissed the case without prejudice. Plaintiff may orally
reinstate the case within 90 days. The judge dismissed the case
after the parties, at his direction, had met outside his chambers
to discuss a way to resolve the case.

2. Despite the dismissal, and because it is without
prejudice, the parties agreed to attempt to resolve the FOIA
request as follows. Mr. Lesar will provide the Agency with a
letter that specifically defines what he means by "any executive
conference of CIA officials" and that narrows the time frame of
his request. CIA will then review the letter and determine
whether and how it can respond.

3. Mr. Lesar said he used the term "executive conference"
because that is how Mr. Marchetti described certain meetings.
From the discussions, it sounds like Mr. Lesar is looking for
minutes of Executive Committee meetings. He also indicated that
he is most interested in the period late-1963 until 1980.
However, we will wait until Mr. Lesar provides us with his
letter. For now, no searches need to. be conducted.

Re: Civil Action No. 81-2543 TAF (D.D.C.)7 .
Mark ve - of f et al.

Dear Rich:

Thank you for your letter of December 23, 1992, outlining de-
fendants‘ counter~proposal for settlement of the above case.

In general, the settlement terms you have set forth are ac—
ceptable to my client. There are, however, two additional matters
which must be included in. any settlement agreement. The first con-~
cerns attorney's fees. My Client insists that he will not settle
this case without an acceptable provision for payment of attorney's
fees. The amount of attorney's fees at issue is not great, a
little over $6,000, so I hope that this issue will not be an ob-
stacle to settlement.

Seconda, although my client understands the problem that
searching for copies of “congressional recoyds" would cause, and
is willing to drop his demand that such records be processed first,
there is one particular record which he still wants processed
before any others. This is the House Select Committee's 375-page
report on Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City several
weeks prior to President Kennedy's assassination. As you may
recall, at a time when your predecessor, Stephen Hart, represented
the defendants, the CIA,. as part of a stipulation between the
parties, wrote the Clerk of the House of Representatives and
inquired whether this document could be processed for release to
Mr. Allen under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.
The Clerk of the House, Mr. Donald K. Anderson, replied that under
the Rules of the House and precedents thereunder, he must withhold
consent and request that the CIA not process the draft study en-
titled “Lee Harvey Oswald, the CIA and Mexico city" for possible
disclosure. (A copy of Mr. Anderson's September 9, 1988 letter
is enclosed.) With passage of the President John F. Kennedy Assas-
sination Records Collection Act of 1992, any impediments to proc~
essing this record for release to Mr. Allen have been removed.


2

If your clients will agree to -these additional pxovisions,
then ny client will agree to the dismissal of this case with preju-
dice.

After you have had a chance to consider this response, please
give me a call. I should be available for a period of time right
before noon, and again between 3:15 and 6:00 p.m.

Sincerely yours,
. :

Section 5, (c)(1), of the "President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992", signed into law by
former President George Bush on October 26, 1992, reads "not
later than 300 days after the date enactment of this Act, each
Government office shall review, identify and organize each
assassination record in its custody or possession for disclosure
to the public, review by the Review Board, and transmission to
the Archivist."

Additionally, subsection (2) (A) directs "in carrying
out paragraph (1), a Government office shall determine which of
its records are assassination records."

Subsection (G)(2), requires this Bureau to "give
priority to the identification, review, and transmission, under
the standards for postponement set forth in this Act, of
assassination records that on the date of enactment of this Act
are the subject of litigation under Section 552 of Title 5,
United States Code."

Mark A. Allen, on April 6, 1981, requested all records
concerning the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)
investigation into the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy. Allen initiated his law- suit in U.S.D.C., D.C. on May
22,1981, demanding the release to him of the requested records.

The Allen litigation clearly falls within the
guidelines of subsection (G) (2) of the JFK Act, therefore, it is
our goal to determine which records fall within the JFK Act
definition of “assassination records". Set forth below are the
criteria which should be utilized to make a determination:

1.) Any mention of JFK and/or any Kennedy surname;

2.) Any document captioned “Assassination of President
John F. Kennedy, Dallas, Texas, November 22,
1963";

3.) Any information regarding assassination threats
and/or allegations against any State or Federal
Government official;

4.) Any information and/or allegation concerning
assassination plots against Cuban leader Fidel
Castro;

.5.) Information concerning the. Cuban "Bay of Pigs
Operation," which was sanctioned by the Kennedy
Administration;

6.) Any reference to the attached list of "JFK core"
and "related" subject matters which are currently
being examined by the JFK Task Force.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Allen v. DOD, Telephone Conversation with Steve Ross

1. On 28 January 1993, I returned the telephone call of
Steve Ross, General Counsel of the House of Representatives.
Mr. Ross had spoken with the CIA GC earlier in the day. He
advised me that he had spoken with Jim Lesar about the draft
House report on Oswald's activities in Mexico City that Mr. Lesar
wants expeditiously processed and released to him as a condition
of settling the subject FOIA litigation.

2. Mr. Ross said he told Mr. Lesar that the House had an
interest in whether the draft report was considered subject to
the plaintiff's FOIA request to CIA. He told Mr. Lesar to send
him a letter stating Mr. Lesar's position, including a chronology
of the court's treatment of House-originated materials. After
Mr. Ross receives the letter, he will review it and provide
Mr. Lesar with the House's position. Mr. Ross is aware that the
parties must report back to the court on 8 February 1993 and
promised Mr. Lesar to have a position before then.

3. Mr. Ross stated that the House is concerned with the
propriety of providing Mr. Lesar special access to a
congressional document, that is not subject to the FOIA, before
members of the general public. fs

Assistant General Counsel
Litigation Division, OGC

SUBJECT: Allen v. DOD, Conference Call with DOJ and NARA
about JFK Material Delivered to NARA last
Summer

1. Today, I spoke with Rich Brown (DOJ) and Mary Rownan
(NARA) about the Agency's need to get copies of the JFK materials
it had sent to NARA in August/September 1992. I advised
Ms. Rownan that the Agency did not retain copies of records that
it had released to NARA in full (such as third-agency material).

2. Ms. Rownan stated that NARA would not want to return the
documents to CIA, however, CIA could come to NARA and make copies
at 10 cents per page. In order to avoid the costs, I asked
whether the Agency could bring its own copier or own paper. She
said we could. She will try to find space for us to make the
copies. She said she would call John Pereira Monday afternoon.
Ms. Rownan also advised that NARA had not prepared identification
aids for any of this material.

3. Ms. Rownan advised us that Diane Dimkoff of her office
had received a copy of a letter from Charlie Howell of the House
Administration Committee to David Gries demanding that House-
originated materials be turned over to NARA immediately.

Mr. Brown and I stated that the Agency would have to notify the
court before the Agency transferred possession of those
documents.

4. Ms. Rownan stated that if CIA transferred the House-
originated materials to NARA, NARA would prepare identification
aids and then refer the records containing CIA information back
to CIA for processing under the Assassination Records Collection
Act. a ara

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM: © Elizabeth R. Rindskopf >?"
General Counsel

SUBJECT: Lesar_v. CIA, Request for Determination Whether
: to Defend FOIA Litigation on Unreasonableness of
Search :

1. Issue. This memorandum seeks your determination whether
to resist a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation because
the required search would be unreasonable, or, as a matter within
your discretion, to undertake the search. We bring this issue to
your attention because the.information sought relates to the
assassination of President Kennedy--a topic that was at the
forefront of DCI Robert Gates announced policy of openness.

2. Recommendation. We recommend you waive the objection
and direct the search be undertaken. We request your
determination by 2 April 1993, because the Agency must respond to
the complaint by 5 April 1993.

3. Background. The subject litigation challenges the
Agency's refusal to search the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings
from 22 November 1963 through 31 December 1979 for information
pertaining either to the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy, or any investigation into that assassination. The
minutes of DCI Morning Meetings are not indexed, but only filed
in chronological order. Therefore, the Agency would have to read
every page of all minutes for a 16 year period. Until the mid-
1970s, DCI Morning Meetings were held every morning. After that
time they were held weekly. The DCI/IRO estimates that the
minutes for this period of time will amount to eight linear feet
of paper and that it would take one person 72 uninterrupted
workhours to review this amount of material. There is no
guarantee that much, if any, responsive information will be found
if the material is searched. If responsive information is
identified, additional time would be necessary to process the
responsive pages.

4. The Agency attempted to resolve this dispute informally
by offering to search any 36 months during the 16 year period
identified by plaintiff. The DCI/IRO believed a search limited
to 36 months would not be unreasonable. However, plaintiff
rejected this offer.



13-00000

SUBJECT: Lesar_v. CIA, Request for Determination Whether to _
Defend FOIA Litigation on Unreasonableness of Search

5. The Law. Under the FOIA, a request must be sufficiently
specific to permit a professional agency employee familiar with
the subject area to locate the record with a reasonable amount of
effort. The Department of Justice is prepared to file a motion
to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds the effort required to
locate the responsive records is unreasonable because there is no
index for the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings. Thus, Agency
employees would have to read eight feet of paper for information
that may not even be there. However, Judge Richey has this case
and he could decide either that the burden is not unreasonable,
or that any unreasonable burden is caused by the Agency’s failure
to index these records.

.

6. Policy. As a matter of discretion, you can accept the
burden, of an unreasonable search. Former DCI Gates recognized
“the public interest in any Agency holdings on the assassination.
Further, the Congress passed, and President Bush signed, the
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992 (ARCA). Under the ARCA, the Agency must process for release
to the National Archives all records pertaining to the
assassination of President Kennedy. The Historical Review Group
(HRG) is currently reviewing assassination material collected as :
part of the House Assassination Committee’s investigation. It
appears that the Agency did not search the minutes of DCI Morning
Meetings as part of the House’s investigation, and the HRG does
not currently plan to search those records. However, the ARCA uu
directs the establishment of a Review Board that can subpoena
records from government agencies. It is foreseeable that the
Review Board (not yet established) may subpoena thé minutes,
possibly at the suggestion of the plaintiff if the Agency
successfully defends this litigation. If a subpoena were issued,
the Agency would have to conduct the search. Further, the
plaintiff could send the Agency another FOIA request for the
minutes of DCI Morning Meetings without regard to subject matter.

- Such a request would clearly be proper and obviously more
burdensome to process.

7. If you agree that the Agency should search this material
for information related to the assassination of President
Kennedy, a future FOIA requester might argue that the Agency can
no longer claim that a search of the minutes for other subject
matters would be unreasonable. The Agency could respond to this
argument on the basis the ARCA created api duty to search
independent of the FOIA.

This letter advises you that the Director of Central ~ Va

-tutelligence has decermined. as a matter of policy, to direct the
Agency to search the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings for
information responsive to the Freedom of Information Act request
underlying the referenced litigation.

Pursuant to our conversation with James Lesar, the search
will be limited to the minutes for meetings occurring on or
between the dates 22 November 1963 and 31 December 1979.
Responsive portions of the minutes, if any, may constitute

"assassination records" under the the President Joh-F,—Kenned:
Assassination Records Collection Act oF EEE (ARCA), Pub. L. No.
102-526, 106 Stat. 3443 (October 27, 1992). Therefore,
responsive portions probably will be transferred to the Agency's a
Historical Review Group (HRG) for processing under the standards
of the ARCA. The ERG, “Ireety TUITy engaged processing the ~~
“Fetords at issue in the Allen v. DOD and AARC v. CZA cases,
probably will not be able to address this information until late
summer or early fall 1993. Under the ARCA, the Agency has until
22 August 1993 to complete its review of identified assasqination
records. The HRG is making its best possible effort to meet that
deadline. :

In light of the Director's decision, I see our options for
responding to this litigation as:

(1) moving to dismiss the case for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies--no administrative appeal. If
successful, this would remove plaintiff's argument that he
is entitled to some expedited treatment under the ARCA.

(2) moving for an Open America stay on a first-in,
first-out basis. There are a number of FOIA requests that
predate the one at issue in this case. For instance, the
Allen request predates this one and, therefore, should be
processed first, even if the litigation is settled.


13-00000

Pamela A. Moreau, Esq.

(3) attempting to settle with Mr. Lesar by agreeing to
provide him with free copies of whatever responsive portions
of the minutes are located and released under the ARCA. In
exchange for this agreement, Mr. Lesar must dismiss tHe

litigation with prejudice.

Each option has its own merits. Please call me so we may
discuss these courses of action. :

Sincerely,

Assistatit-General cSunsel

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Allen v. DOD, AARC v. CIA, and Lesar v. CIA, Meeting
with Jim Lesar

1. “Today, I attended a meeting at the ae Department
with Richard Brown and Pamela Moreau of DOJ and Jim Lesar. The
purpose of the meeting was to discuss settling the three subject
FOIA litigations. DOJ will begin Grafting settlement agreements a

to dismiss all three cases with prejudice.

2. With respect to the Allen/, Cc cases, Mr. Brown informed
Mr. Lesar of the meeting with NARA na the House. Charles

Howell, Chief Counsel to the Hougé Committee on Administration,

had promised to propose to his principals that the House send Y
NARA a letter. That letter would authorize NARA to. permit CIA to
process House-originated materials before sending them to NARA

and would direct that the entire segregated collection be stored
together. Mr. Brown advised Mr. Lesar that upon NARA's receipt

of this letter, the Agency would be in a position to agree to the
following settlement terms:

Within 30 days! of signing the settlement agreement,
CIA will provide Mr. Lesar with copies of the materials
already sent to NARA last summer, minus the one box of
third-agency material that needs to be processed.

With respect to the remaining Executive branch material
in the collection:

A copy of documents to be released with no a
redactions will be provided to Mr. Lesar, with a copy
of the documents' identification aids, within five
working days after it is transmitted to NARA.

A copy of documents to be released with redactions a
will be provided to Mr. Lesar, with a copy of the
documents' identification aid, within five working days
after it is transmitted to the Review Board. If the

» I told Mr. Lesar I would have to check on the feasibility

of this time period. I was not sure of the capability of the
reproduction facilities NARA was providing the Agency’ to

reproduce the documents. =


13-00000

SUBJECT: Allen v. DOD, AARC v. CIA, and Lesar v. CIA, Meeting
with Jim Lesar

Review Board orders additional information released,
and no appeal is taken to the President, a copy of the
new version of the document will be provided to

Mr. Lesar within five working days after it is
transmitted to NARA.

If a document is withheld in its entirety, a copy
of the identification aid, if possible, will be
provided to Mr. Lesar within five workgng days after

- the documents is transmitted to the Ropiew Board.

With respect to House-originated material in the
collection, CIA will obtain a copy of the version of the
document to be made available to the public at NARA and
provide that copy to Mr. Lesar, free of charge, within five
working days after it is made publicly available by NARA.

3. In consideration of the gobve, Mr. Lesar will dismiss
both the Allen case and the AARCase with prejudice. However,
DOJ will permit him to litigate his entitlement to attorney's
fees as a separate matter. Mr. Lesar agreed to the above. He
did, however, want some commitment from the House that it would
direct NARA to give priority processing to all House-originated
materials in CIA's segregated collection. I explained to

Mr. Lesar that the House material was not segregated and
therefore, NARA could not process the documents until it received
them from us. Further, CIA would send the materials to NARA by
the box and would not segregate House materials to ship
separately. I advised Mr. Lesar that the archival -integrity of
the collection was of particular importance to the House. He
seemed satisfied with this explanation and, I think, will drop
this new demand for expeditious processing by NARA of all the
House documents.

4. Mr. Lesar asked how the Agency was coming with its
processing. I advised him that we were still trying to work out
technical problems with the software NARA sent us to prepare the
identification aids. Rich Brown then joked that we probably
would not have a Review Board appointed until 1995 anyway.

5. With respect to the Lesar v. CIA case,”

Mr. Lesar agreed
to settle that case on the following terms:

? This FOIA litigation seeks copies of those portions of

the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings that pertain to the
assassination of President Kennedy or to investigations into that
assassination,


13-00000

SUBJECT: Allen v. DOD, AARC v. CIA, and Lesar v. CIA, Meeting

with Jim Lesar

CIA will review the minutes from 22 November 1963
through 31 December 1979. The Agency does not need to
review any entries for the year 1972. Mr. Lesar will
provide the Agency with a list of names that may assist
reviewers to identify assassination-related discussions in
the minutes of DCI Morning Meetings.

i “If the Agency identifies any responsive information, it
will process that information pursuant to the Assassination
Records Collection Act. That means resact fine will have to
be approved by the Review Board. Mr. Lesay confirmed the
Agency may redact any entry on a page of the minutes that is
not responsive to his request.

; CIA will provide Mr. Lesar with copies of the
responsive portions that are not redacted as soon as they
are prepared. CIA will provide him with copies of sanitized
‘responsive portions that are gahitized within five working
) daysiafter transmitting thosg portions to the Review Board.
If the ‘Review Board orders additional information released,
and.no ‘appeal is taken ‘to the President, a copy of the new
version’ will be provided to Mr. Lesar within five working
days after it is transmitted to NARA.

6. In consideration of the above, Mr. Lesar will dismiss
the case with prejudice if the government Roan to pay his
filing cost ($125). oe

2. As far as HRG is concerned, we are processing
relevant Agency records under the Act for release to the
National Archives. More than 125,000 pages have already
been released to the Archives, where they are available to
the public. We are applying the JFK Assassinations Records

Section 6 of the Act provides the standards for our
recommendations as to what information should be withheld.

3. Beyond the Act, there is no formal HRG file of
instructions on implementing the Assassinations Records Act.
Guidance is generally given orally to HRG officers. In

certain names or other specific information may or may not

amended, and the CIA Information Act, 50 U.S.C. § 431. Our

Dear Mr. Lesar:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your 25 November 1994
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, submitted on
behalf of the Assassination Archives and Research Center, for
“a copy of any index or inventory in electronic format of the
following records: (1) Lee Harvey Oswald’s 201 file; (2) the
‘segregated collection’ of records which*the CIA made
available to the House Select Committee on Assassinations;
and (3) any other records which the CIA has processed
-pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy Records Collection
Act of 1992.” You further state that “[you] want copies of
any. and all such indices in their current state, regardless
of whether they are ‘complete.’”

With respect to items 1 and 3, as you are aware, the
Agency’s Historical Review Group is preparing an electronic
index of JFK assassination records which is being forwarded
to you in sections as each section is completed.- This
activity includes Oswald’s 201 file.

Further, with respect to items 2 and 3, these items are
identical to items 1 and 2 of your 15 October 1994 FOIA
request, F94-1959. Please refer to paragraphs 2 and 3 of our
12 December 1994 response to your 15 October request wherein
we addressed these items.

We are unable to assist you further in this matter.

Reference: F95-1225
Dear Mr. Newey:

This is to acknowledge receipt of your 11 July 1995
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for records on the
following deceased individual:

“Richard Scully CAIN, a/k/a Richard S. CAIN, a/k/a
Ricardo SCALZETTI, a/k/a Richard SCALZETTI, a/k/a
Ricardo SCALZITTI, a/k/a Richard SCALZITTI, a/k/a
Richard SCULLY.”

Our records show that we conducted a thorough search
under the FOIA for records pertaining to the subject of your
request on behalf of a previous requester. We located
material which was reviewed and denied in its entirety.

However, since your letter mentions allegations of an
association of the subject of your request with the
assassination of President Kennedy, you should know that this
Agency’s records on the assassination of President Kennedy
have been re-reviewed under the narrower nondisélosure
provisions of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Collection Act of 1992. These re-reviewed records
have been transferred to the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) in compliance with the Act. For copies
of these records you should submit your request to NARA at
the following address: i

Archives Review Branch
Records Declassification Division
Room 18W
National Archives and Records Administration
7th and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20408

Also in accordance with the Act, those records whose
public disclosure in whole or in part has been recommended
for postponement are now undergoing further re-review by the
Presidentially-appointed Assassination Records Review Board
(ARRB). The ARRB process is likely to result in more public



13-00000

disclosure of information from these records. Consequently,
these records will not be reviewed again by this Agency
pending ARRB determinations which, in turn, must be approved
or disapproved by the President. Furthermore, records, or
information in such records, whose postponement of public
disclosure is continued by the President, will become subject
to the requirements of periodic review as specified in the
Act.

We hope that we have been of some assistance with your
request.
