advised Mr. Houston that the FBI office in New York stated that
Herbert Itkin was reluctant to make a guilty plea in the two mis-
demeanor cases pending before the New York State court. It was
the opinion of the FBI agents that Itkin could be persuaded to
accept this course of action but was merely negotiating at this
time for federal assistance in the custody hearing in the family
court in Westchester County. Mr. Papich also stated that a
hearing was anticipated on the custody question, and Itkin at this
point was suggesting that CIA's name be interjected into the
hearing to bolster his stature with the court.
