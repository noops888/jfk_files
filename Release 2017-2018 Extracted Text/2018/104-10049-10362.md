and given to Colonel. King by Mr. Pawley on 19 October, which was a 7
of Mr.:Pawley's conversations with two Cubans during the

menbors of-which have talked to Mr, Paley recently about their

2. Tue unidentified Cuban, who bad sonevat of an sccent and
epoke indistinctly, wes difficult to understand. He mentioned a
necting "with some af our ppople who came up from Cuba” to discuss
plang.’ He said bis group had been contacted by 8 representative of
General Jose Bleutorio PEDBAZA, leader of Cuban revolutionary groups
4n the Dominican Republic, who wanted to know what action their group
hed taken and wag told that they had a plan "to start sabotage". The

and moneys he pointed out that Cubans in Ouba are afraid’ to start an
movement, and there was no way to raise funds, etc. Mrs

Pawley gave him no encouragement on the money angle, saying that even
if there were Americans willing to ray the riek of becoming involved
in Cuban revolutionary activities by furnishing money for such a
movement, which he doubted, he felt that at the present time it would
be. like “putting money down.s rat~hole" for the following reasonss.
(1) there 49 no. unity among the anti-CASTHO groups, and there are ab
least 10 that he knows of who are working absolutely independently of
one anothers snd (2) GASTRO is in control of the country and has the
support of a large number of Cubans, especially the under-privileged.
Mr, Pawley said he felt the Cuban economic situation was worsening
fast and that if it gets bad enough, a large nunber of Cubans will
tyrn on CASTRO; but until that time comes it would be banat to
try to organise a rewolutionary movement.

Support of the U. 8. and the Cuban replied thatithey wanted U. S.

obdiged to carry through with their plans. Mr. Pawley said he didn't

thing could be done. He said, “having been connected with the U. 5.
Government, I can't ges. involved in revolutionary movements", Also

which might de difficult to avoid with so many Cuban exiles there, -
but comuented’ that he understood "the Dominican Government. hasn't
given then a dime".
