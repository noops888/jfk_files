IV. IMPLEMENTATION:

To undertake the above listed tasks, CLA would be required to develop

and carry out the following program (which constitutes a substantial expan-

sion of the curient program, particularly in fields other than intelligence).

A. Intelligence (FI):

The current build-up of intelligence assets must be intensified

and expanded. No additional policy approvals are needed. The follow -

ing types of actions will be maximized:

1. Spotting/recruiting/training of legally established Cubans

in Cuba or in Cuban government posts abroad.

Establishment and

maintenanc√© of reliable, secure communications will become more

critical as police state controls increase.

2.

Spotting/recruiting/training of third country nationals

resident in Cuba.

3.

Spotting/recruiting/training of legal travelers who have

potential access to significant information.

B. Psychological Warfare (CA):

The program must primarily concentrate on and reach the Cuban

population. It will have to provide aggressive and provocative

propaganda as well as the milder themes. Clear authority to engage

in "high noise level" types of propaganda operations calling for work

stoppages, slow-downs, sabotage, and other forms of militant mass

action and widespread overt resistance is required.

The following psychological warfare activities are considered

essential:

1.

The establishment of a sufficiently powerful Radio Free Cuba

located in Southern Florida or other appropriate area. When this is in

operation, the Swan Island operation will be terminated. Policy

approval to establish this is required.
