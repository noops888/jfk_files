MEMORANDUM FOR: 0/SA/DO/O '
Attention: Mr. Shepanck |

FROM: William F. Donnelly
Chicf, Information Services Staff

SUBJECT: House Select Committee on Assassinations
Request for Information on 201 Criteria (S)

REFERENCE: OLC 78-0070/19, 23 February 1978

1. (S) With reference to the conversation of

27 February between Mr. Shepanek and Mr. Cleffi of ISS,

: attached are copies of DOKB 70-1-1, 15 November 1974,

: and an earlier version, CSHB 43-1-1 dated 15 February 1960.

i A close study of the list of questions submitted by the

7 HSCA Staff has led us to conclude that the most complete
and effective way to respond would be by inviting the
Staff to review our regulation governing the criteria for
opening, maintaining, controlling and closing 201 files
by the Operations Directorate. A careful reading of the
regulation provides an answer to every question posed by
the Staff.

2.  (S) The earlier version of the regulation is
included to reflect the situation as it existed in the
period of their primary concern (1958-1964). The later
version provides an expansion, clarification and refinement
of the earlier versions.

ANNEX B
THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-1; 27 October 1968

1. INTRODUCTION

‘The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for control!ing and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sulficient interest to justify
‘opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CT investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2 THE 201 SYSTEM
‘The principal features of the 201 system are:

a The 201 Number: a unique number, ie., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that
individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographie reporting on and references to the individual, ie., per-
sonal history, current status, and prospects, ‘

©. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of
@ 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved’ for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, s.cceeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated.

e. OI Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. OI codes cover intelli-
gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, er known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two categories of OI
codes for use by components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)

(2) OF codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.
‘A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a meme

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 202 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an Ol code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
of that service. s

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER
a. Ceneral

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
& master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on ,
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per- #
‘sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those :
persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals
are requested (sce exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff -

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk ;
and on whom no DDO records correspondence evists are not a part of the DDO j
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require. ‘
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose
names appear in incoming dispatches. These’ are listed in Attachment 2. 201
dossiers should be opened in the foilowing categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested

for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-
tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than
denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

(5) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals iaformation in five
or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(8) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headgimrters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting
@ 201 Personality File Action Request (Form §31) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 20I's. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after the
subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
Placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN.
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations arc notified of
‘901 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

Ol code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other than AA and those
with no OI code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that
Persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also
that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific
as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation code for a courier
covers only 2 documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one
