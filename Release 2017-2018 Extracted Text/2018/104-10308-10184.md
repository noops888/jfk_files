2. Since transmission of reference A to Headquarters several
developments occurred which effectively eliminated several alternate
solutions to the problem of the AMLEO-2 family in Cuba. The
alternate solutions that were eliminated, as found in paragraph
Sof reference A, wero (a) "Maintain Status Quo as a Family
attempting Leave Cuba via Offices of Swiss Embassy as Part of the
American Repatriation Program"; :(b): "fave, AMLU
Withdraw Papers From the Swiss Embassy ami. American Repatrintion
Program and “Attempt Leavé Cuba‘.as Normal Refugees. via Mexico
Or Spain"; ana (e) “Haye the ANLEGS Family Case Taken up Kith the
GOC°Through the ‘Donovan’ Channel for Possible Legal Exfiltratiou".
Elimination of the above alternates left only two solutions
that were at all feasible; (c) "Have tho AMLKO-3 Family Take
Asylum in either the Uruguayan or Mextan Embassics in Havana",
or (d) "lave tho AMLEO-3 Family Exfiltrated black in a Maritime
Operation by either a RUDARK or Independent Maritino Team,"
.Because of the inherent risk involved in a black exfiltration,
it was decided that the AMLEO-S family should be put into
asylum in either the Uruguayan or ilcxican embassies with all

possible speed.

3. To this end steps were initiated in on 24 July 1963

to put the AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 into asylum in the Mexican |
Embassy Havana The AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 were advised
via the (AMWEE+}SOWVL channel on 4 August 1963 to proparo
themselves for asylum and to await further orders via the same
channel. KUBARK. Station in Mexico City, meanwhile, tool: urgent

- action through channels to have the ifexican
Foreign Minist: he AMLEO-3 family and
AMLEO-2; and then send word to the Mexican Enbassy in Havana,
Cuba that the AMLZEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 should be granted asylum
when they appeared at the Mexican Consulate under cover of
obtaining their visas. The visa portion of the operation was
satisfactorily completed and notification of same was sent into
the Hexican Embassy in Havana; but word re asylum for the
AMLEO-3 family and AMLEO-2 was not sent to the Mexican embassy
due to insecure comio channels and lack of trusted couriers, and
to.date no secure. method has yet been found to notify the Moxican
Embassy in Havana that asylum should be granted to tho ANLEOs.

7 4. As a result of the above, word was sent to OMVES-1

via OWL on 11 September requésting he detomine whether or ‘not
Identity A’would be willing to act as intermediary to receive
the AMLEOQ-3 family and AMLEO-2 into asylum at a specific tine
_and date at the Mexican consulate, ‘AMWSE-1)asked for
clarification on the manner of approaching Identity A on the case
on 13. September via-pouch, and more detailed guidance on the
matter was-sent to him via CiiVL on 14 September, /A final reply
xe_possibilitios for action via. Tosa ig oxpected from
(AMWER~1\ momentarily. If the (AMWEE-l}reply is favorgble, then
he will be told to arrange the meeting at the Mexican consulate
between the AMLEOs and Identity A so that they can be taken into
asylum by the Mexicans.

5, As noted in reference B, if the ‘rqport is a
negative one, then consideration will be given to having the
ANMLEOs take asylum in tho Uruguayan Exbassy in Havana, The
test case utilizing AMCANCK-3, mentioned in paragraph 5 A of
reference B, 1s to be attempted on or about 21 August 1965, and
if this attempt at asylum is successiui then arrangewcnts will
be made to have the AMLEGs enter the Uruguayan Iimbassy in the
same manner.

Ie G.. As noted in paragraph 1 of reference B, the wife

£ AMLEO-3 finally made a direct contact with AMTHUG-1 on 7

September 1963, while he was at his Santa Maria beach house,
i and appealed to: him for permission to leave Cuba with her
} children and rejoin her husband AMLEO-3 in the United States.
On 14 Soptember 1963 AMLEO-3 received a letter from his wife
giving more details on the above mecting., The wife of AULTO-3
had been visiting the beach home of a family friend, situated
next.to that of AMTHUG-1 on Santa Maria beach, 9n x daily basis
hoping to see AMTHUG-1. Finally, on 7 September 1965, she saw
him swimming alone in the ocean and prowptly went into the water,
introduced herself , and requested prmission to talk to bin. E
AKTHUG-1 granted tlts permission, and during their conversation
ANTHUG-1 made it clear he would not grant Mrs, AMLLO-3 permission
to depart Cuba at this tine, stating that the tinue was not
propitious due to the attacks and raids being carried out
against Cuba, and that Hrs, AMLEO-3 would just have to wait.
Mrs, AMLEO-3 then told him she did not sce why he was holding her
and her children responsible for what her hueband did; that she
feared her husband might forget her and their children completely
4f the separation continued, and that 1f AMLEO-3 was left much
longer alone he would find a woman to replace her, ANTIIUG-1
replied by asking her "Do you consider yourself a burden to your
husband?" The wife replicd "It is possible", and ANTHUG-1 then
' asked "But he calls you every day." _

7. Later during the conversation ANTHUG-1 asked
Mra, AULEO-3 if her husband still had the presentation Soviet
pistol that he.had given him in 19G1, and Mrs. AMLEO-3
informed him that her husband had taken it with hin when ho
defected and asked ANTHUG-1 1f ho wanted it returned to him.
AMTHUG-1 did not reply to the question, Later on, while
discussing her conversation with AMTHUG-1 with Identity B,
Identity B suggested to Mrs, AMLEO-3 that she request AMLEO-3
to send tho pistol back to AMTHUG-1 via Ambassador LECHUGA
at the United Nations, NYC, Identity B added that the return
of the pistol might help matters since tho loss of the pistol had
been one of the things that bothered AMTHUG-1 most when
AMLEO-3 defected, (i.e, AMLEO-3-has noted that these special
presentation Sovict pistols were given by AXTHUG-1 to probably

special meaning for ANTHUG-1 since the recipients were supposed
to be his very personal and close fricnds, AMLEO-3 elains

that not even ANLOUT-1 had received one of these special
presentation pistols from ANTHUG-1.) Consideration is being
given to AMTHUG-1's request, if it would assist irs. AMLEO-3
in her efforts to leave Cuba, but for the time being the pistol
will be held by KURARK. :

8, ANTHUG-1 also told Mrs. AML£0-3 that her husband had
wtelen a light plane when he fled and implied (although she
does not so state directly) that he would like to see it
returned, The balance of Mrs. AMLEO-3's letter concerned her
desire to- leave Cuba, mentioned the necessity for calmness by both
she and“her husband with no rash actions, and without giving
any additional facts stated that-her conversation with ANTHUG-1
had been a long one but that she could not get him to make
any promises re hor departure,

DEVELOPMENT OF OPRRATIONAL LEADS TO DISAFFECTED CUBANS

9. During the operational period one of AMLEO-3's
operational leads, whom he had written a report on for the
AMTRUNK PM operation, was recruited vla the recently successful
ANTRUNK infiltration operation and given the crypt of AMTRUNK~10,
AMLEO-3 also screenod additional ANTRUNK leatis and KUTUBE |
military leads during the period and was able to submit
reports on some four individuals for these operations, All such
leads were fed to him mixed in with many other Cuban names,
| AMLEO-3 is presontly preparing reports on PHS target studics
|Major Felipe GUERRA Matos and Major Jorge SEGUERA, Cuban

| Ambassador to Algeria.

10, AHLEO-3 also assisted in tho handling of AMLEO-5's H
wife during the period when she established direct telephonic |
communication with her husband in Cuba, and tried to convince |
him that she wanted to return to Cuba with her children, \

country first and resolve their personal family problems. |
AMLEO-3 baby sat for the wife during these calls, since we i
only knew what day the calls would be coming in and never the
hour, He also assisted Mrs. AMLEO-5 in recording the last tcloph:
conversation she had with her husband, In this same operation
AMLEO-3 also assisted the Case Officer in the conversations

held with the mother of AMLEO-5 while she was in the United
States, although he va never allowod to cstablish direct
contact with the mother, We had hoped that the mother of
AMLEO-5 would attempt to establish contact onher own with
AMLEO-3, but to WAVE Station knowledge she never attempted to do
50. If she had, we would have allowed AMLEO-3 to respond to her
contact efforts (maintaining his cover as being disassociated

with ODYOKE)

11. During the period fragmentary information has been
received fron the wife of AMIC-3 (utilizing nicknames or other

code phrases for individuals) indicating that Identity B
has continued to be very helpful to her by supplying

“her with blackmarket food, loaning her her automobile, and other-

wise assisting her with hor problems. Identity B may be
carrying out such actions on a genuine friendship basis,

(she hag even been denounced by the neighborhood defense
committee “as assisting gusanos") or she may be buying insurance
for the future, Thé possibility also exists that she is reaaining
@ confidant of Mrs, AHMLEO-3 on orders of AMTUUG-1 and is
reporting on all developments to AMTHUG-1. In early September
1963 Raul PRIMELLES (201-327902) arrived at Identity B's

home for a visit while Mra. AMLEO-3 was present, Mr and urs.
PRIMELLES ignored the presence of Mrs. A-3 and did not speak

to hercwhile greeting Identity B. Because of this Identity B
promptly turned her back on her visitors and did not anaver

them, continuing ber conversation with Mrs. AMLUQ-3.. Mr. and

Mrs. PRIMELLES were thrown into some confusion by this reception
and departed from the area.

12, Mrs. AMLEO-3 has also mentioned that UNSNAFU-12
vas most kind to her during her recent hone leave in Cuba,
and made it quite clear she was anxious to get in touch with
AMLEO-3, During the latter part of August Mrs. A~3 again
mentioned to her husband that UNSNAFU-12 had written Identity
B from Faris stating she was surprised at not having heard
from AMLEO-3,

ATTITUDE, MORALE,. AND PERFORMANCE OF AMLEO-3.

13, “During thé reporting period AMLEO-3 has consistently
been cooperative with his C/O and has maintained a good attitude
towards his work. During the latter part of Agust 1963 AMLEO-3
began to lose his patience with the slow progross in gotting
his wife into asylum, and began requesting permission to return
to Cuba himself in order to exfiltrate his wife black. AMLEO-3
became quite demanding in this regard and claimed that KUDARK's
time had run out, and since he had waited paticntly for vine
nonths he now felt it was his turn to try his luck, AMNLEC-3
is extremely confident of his own ability in action situations
and operations and extensive argumentation was neoded to
persuade him that such a course of action yould be suicidal
for his wife and children and that his wisest course of action
would be to give us additional time to bring the asylum operation
to a successful covclusion, Because of AMLE0~3's faith in
higher authority, COS JNWAVE, Andrew K. REUTEMAN visited A¥LLO-3
on 8 September 1963 for’ the purpose of convincing him that any
unilateral action on his part would only be counterproductive
and playing right into AMTHUG-1's hands, KUBARK's limited
commitments to AMLEO-3 were also reviewed along with the history
of our actions to help his wife and children leave Cuba legally.
After some frank exchanges of facts ANLEO-3 was finally convinced
that the only productive course of action left to him was to
continue to sweat out the asylum proposition and hope for the
best. Absolutely no further commitments were made to AMLEO-3
during these discussions and alternate courses of action if
the asylum attempts fail were not discussed but instead left in
abeyance.

OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AND PLANNING

14, As previously mentioned in paragraph 13 of refcrence A,
ANLEO-3 went to ZRBETAL during the period 26-30 July 1963 for
the purpose of obtaining a French visa for his alias
documentation, AMLEO-3 successfully obtained the French visa
duricg this trip, and his alias passport now contains valid visas
for travel to Spain and France,

15. WAVE Station regrots that reference C has not been
ansvered to date, In reply we can only state that AMLEO-3
was thoroughly briefed on the limitations of his alias docuxentation
when said documentation was issued to him. He was told that thu
credit card docunents could never be used for identification or
credit purposes, He. had also been warned to avoid situations
where he would be asked for positive identification, such as
renting a car, and by attempting to procure a rental car in
ZRMETAL he was acting contrary to instructions given to hin
by_his WA’ O. On ‘0~3's return to WAVE he was castigated for
his actions, and again briefed on the limitations of hfs alius
documentation, In order to strengthon his alias documentation

cover story was that he recently moved to the Miami area from
New Orleans, Louisiana (which city the Subject lived hn for
several years and has relatives residing thore). The Subjet's
documentation. is therefore correct for his cover story, The
spelling of “instalnent" on the National Credit Card was correctly
copied from the original document reproduced by KURIOT and we must /,
point out that “instaluent" 4s not only correct according ‘to tho ‘9

costs

16, AMLBO-3 continues to receive a flat salary of five
hundred dollars ($59.00) per month, and also is paid approximately
one hundred dollars ($100.00) per mouth for purchase of foodstuffs
since he is encouraged to cat his meals in the KUBARK
safehouse and stay out of public places, We have also continued
to pay the wife of ANLKO-S the amount of one hundred and twenty five
dollars ($125.00) per month for subsistance for herself and her
two ‘children to supplement the $126.00 per month she receives
from. the Cuban Refugee Center. The C/O has continued his efforts
‘to find part-time employment for Mrs, AMLEO-5 so that KUBARK
could be relieved of the necessity to support her, but to date
we have been unsuccessful in our efforts primarily because Mrs.
AMLEO-5 has never worked in her life aod has no work skills
whatsoever, No other financial expenditures of note were made
during the period, and no financial assistance is presently
contemplated for any other AMLEOs.

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

17, During the reporting period no positive intelligence
reports were digseminatod by the AMLEO group since none of the
active agents are located in the target area, nor do they
circulate in Cuban exile circles.

18, We are continuing to utilize AMLEO-3 as a consultant
on the MMAPRCN program, and to this end are planning to have
him expand his reporting of personality information on selected
individuals and to utilize him to explain interconnections
between various individuals and groups as they take shape in
MHAPRON research,
