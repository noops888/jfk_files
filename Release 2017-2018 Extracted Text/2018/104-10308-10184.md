EFFORTS TO LEGALLY EXFILTRATE AMLEC-3 FAMILY FIOS CUBA

2. Since transmission of reference 1 to Headquarters

developments occurred which effectively eliminated several alternato

solutions to the problem of the AlLEO-3 family in Cuba.

alternate solutions that were eliminated, as found in paragraph

¿ of reference A, vero (a) "Maintain Status Quo as a Family

attempting Leave

Cuba via Offices of Swiss Embassy

as Part of the

American Repatriation Program': (b). "Have MMLL0-3 Family

Withdraw Papers From the Swiss Enbassy and American Repatrintion

Program and Attempt Leavo Cubans Normal Refugees via Mexico:

Or Spain"; and

"Ilaye the AMLEO3 Family Case Taken up Kith the

GOC Through the 'Donovan' Channol for Possible Legal Extiltratiou".

Elimination of the above alternates left only two solutions

that were at all feasible; (c) "Have tho All.LO-3 Family

Asylum 1n either the Uruguayan or Mexican Embassics in Havana",

or (d) "Ilave tho AHLEO-3 Fanily Exfiltrated black in a Maritine

Operation by either a RUBARK. or Independent Maritine Team."

Because of the inherent risk Involved in a black exfiltration,

1t. was decided that tho 11150-3 fanily should be put into

asylum in either the Uruguayan or lexicon embassies with all

possible speed.

Informed him that her husband had taken it with him when ho

defected and asked ANTHlUG-1 1f ho wantod it roturned to him.

AMTHUG-1 did not reply to the question.

Later on,

discussing her conversation with AMTHUG. with Identity B,

Identity B suggested to Mrs. AMLEO-3 that she request ANLEO-3

to send the pistol back to AMTHUC-1 via Ambassador LEClUGA

at the United Nations, NYC.

Identity B added that the return

of the pistol might help matters since tho loss of the pistol bai

been one of the things that bothered AMTHUG-1 most when

AMLEQ-3 defected.

(1.C. AMLEO-3. has noted that these special

presentation Soviet pistols were given by ANTHUG-1 to probably

less than ten peoplo in Cuba, and their presentation had a very

special meaning for ANTHUG-1

ANTIUG-1 also told Hrs. AlLSO-3 that her husband had

stolen a light plane when he fled and Implied (although sho

does not so state directly) that he would llke to see it

returned.

The balance of Mrs. AMLIO-3's letter concerned her

desire to leave Cuba, mentioned the necessiy for sinness by both

she and her husband with no rash actions, and without giving

any additional facts stated that her conversation nith ANHUG-l

had boen a long one but that she could not get him to uake

any promises re hor departuro.

DEVELOPKENT OF OPERATIONAL LEADS TO DISEFFLCTED CUBANS

During the operational period

one of AHLEO-3's

operational leads,

whom he had written a report on for the

AMTRUNK PM operation', was recruitra via the recently successful

AMTRUNK infiltration operation and givon the crypt of ATRuk-10.

AMLEO3 also screened additional ANTRUNK leads and KUlUBE

reporting on all developments to AbTHUG-1•

In early September

1963 Raul PRIMELLES (201-127902) arrived at Identity B's

home for a visit while Mrs. AMLEO-3 was present.

Mr. and Hrs.

PRIELLES Ignored the presence of Mrs. A-3 and did not speak

to her-while greeting Identity B. Because of this Identity B

promptly turned her back on her visitors and did not answer

them, continuing her conversation with Mrs. AMLCO- 3.. Mr. and

MIS. PRIMELLES were thrown into some confusion by this reception

and departed from the area.

MrS. AMLEO-3 has also mentioned that UNSNAFU-12

for his wife and children and that his wisest course of action
