Chairman. All right. The hearing will come to order
Mr. McNamara, would you please stand and take the oath.
1 Mr. McNaeara. Surely.
| The Chairsan. Do you swear that all of the testimony you
\ are about to -.c/ve in this proceeding will be the truth,
| the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Mr. McNamara. I do,
The Chairman. Mr. Schwarz will commence.

TESTIMONY OF ROBERT 8. MCNAMARA

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. McNamara, I understand you have a
prepared statement. Before making that could I just put a
couple of things on ‘the record.

First, your name and address, if you could.

Mr. McNamara. Robert S. McNamara, 2412 Tracy Place,
Washington, D. C.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, further, as a procedural matter, we
always go through this with all our witnesses and you know
you have the right to counsel -- a right to counsel.

‘ Mr. McNamara. I do.

Mr. Schwarz. And if you want to stop to obtain counse!
at any time you have that right?

Mr. McNamara, I understand.

Mr. Schwarz. - And you also have all of the Conatitutiona
rights, including those under the Bill of Rights.

Mr. McNamara, I read the rules of the Committee and :

think I am familiar with then.

The Chairman. Your Constitutional rights are not ex-
tended by virtue of any committee action.

(Laughter)

The Chairman. But if you do have a prepared statement,
Mr. McNamara.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you have extra copies?

Mr. McNamara. I unfortunately don't. I gave one to the

counsel a few minutes ago. It is a brief statement, three

and a half pages.

The Chairman, Would you commence with the statement?
Mr. McNamara, Yes.
On June 6, Mr. Chairman, as you will recall, I wrote
to you saying, and I quote, "I want you to know that although
I doubt that I have anything to contribute to your investigation
if your staff or your committee wishes to question me about
my knowledge of the events you are investigating, I will be
very happy to respond.”
My letter was written because my name had been aasociated
in the press with repeated discussions within the Governmen
in the summer of 1962 of a poasible assassination attompt
against Premier Castro.
The Chairman, Did you mean to say repeated or
reported discussion?

Mr. McNamara, Beg your pardon. I meant to say reported.

TOP SECRET



riousness of, the repeated or reported

Tt seems to me the
2
|

~ jl any question of the appropriateness of my testifying, given
4 | wy obligation as an international civil servant.
5 The first thing I want to say is that I have no knowledge

© || of information of any proposal for the assassination of Premier

.

Castro coming from President Kennedy or Robart Kennedy. In
8 | pact, I would regard such a proposal as totally inconsistent

% || with everything I know about the two men.

Secondly, it has been asserted in the press that in a

meeting I attended on August 10, ‘62, with Secretary Ruak,

John McCone, then Director of Central Intelligence,

and McGeorge Bundy, the question of assassination was raised

4 and dismissed but that shortly after meeting a memorandum

‘ was circulated by Major General Edward Lansdale calling for a

2" number of actions relating to the situation in Cuba, including

K
the preparation of contingency plans for Castro's assassina-
tion; that when a copy of the memorandum recahed Mr. McCone |

‘ ls he called me and I agreed with him that an assassination
: + atttempt should not be considered and the item was in

:

: fact eliminated from the memorandum.

Other press stories appearing since my testimony was
scheduled before you have quoted General Lansdale to the

effect he had been requested by Robert F. Kennedy to develo:

assassination plans: for disposing of Castro, and the project

envisioned the whole spectrum of plans from overthrowing the
Cuban leader to a inating him, although the then Attorney
General it was said never used the word assassination.
Lansdale was reported to have said he developed the plans

| without the knowledge of myself or Mr. McCone, but that we
both had become aware of the planning later.

Later news stories state that Lansdale modified his

statemont to say “perhaps some place in the plans there was

something to do about the leader who had threatened the

lives of millions of Americans", and to claim that he, Lansdole,

“ruled out assassination” because “that is not my bag anyway”.
Since reading these press stories I have tried to recon-

; atruct the actual sequence of events and I have refreshed my

" recollection from docunents in your committen's possassion,
from conversations with other persone involved, and from a

* file memorandum written in 1967 that Mr. MeCone was able to
produce for me.

As I reconstruct it this is what happened.

Following the Bay of Pigs and extending throughout the
spring and summer of '62, there was a good deal of concern
within the U.S, Government about attempted subversion of Lati::
American Governments by the Communist regime in Cuba. To
thwart these attempts the continuing program of covert ac~

tivities directed against the Castro regimo was mounted under

the direction of an inter-Agency group. And I want to return

before completing my statement.

y

of I believe General Lansdale had been attached from the

4 | assignment in the Defense Department to serve as Staff

Director of this group beginning sometime in late ‘61 or

early '62. In August '62 several meetings of the group were

7 | neld. On at least one occasion principals, including Secretary

Rusk and myself, were in attendance.

In one or more of the meetings of the group the subject

* of assassination of Premier Castro was apparently discussed.

| Some news reports have asserted the subject was advanced at

the August 10th meeting in Secretary Rusk's conference room

c. 14 raised the subject myself.

opposed such action. I have no Peesiiest citer even discuss-
ing the matter.

No one of the senior officials present at the meeting

with whom I have talked recalls me discussing it. Mr. McCone'»
recollection in his file memorandum prepared sometime five
years later, on. April 14, 1967, is that the subject was

included a request for contingency plans for the a.

in the memorandum he later ‘Prepared in his capacity as

Staff Director to the Inter-Agency group and addressed to

the CIA lsaisun officu:, Mi. Nar.ey. Todid nct ran the Lane-
Gale memorandum when it was prepared and did ‘not learn of

its existence. until Mr. McCone telephoned me about it when

it was brought to his attention.

At that time I expressed opposition ‘to any gwination

, attempt and I agreed with Mr. McCone no such planning should

be undertaken. I understand the memorandum was modified.

I have no knowledge or information about any other plans
or preparations for a possible assassination attempt against
Premier Castro.

I believe now and I think Mr. McCone's memorandum
supports my recollection, that I believed then that the
U.S. Government should not undertake or encourage assassina-
tion openly or secretly as an instrument of national policy
against people with whom we are not at war,

It may be argued that given the extensive program of
covert action against the Castro regime in which the U.S.
government was engaged at the time that it would only be a
short term to attempted assassination but 1 can't accept that
argument on its face. Bribery and industrial sabotage are
not the same things as murder. But having said that I want

to conclude this portion of my statemont by saying that I

believe we completely misjudged the seriousness of the poten- !

tial danger to this country from Cuba and that we overreacted

accordingly. In fact, I have serious doubts about the

» value or the propriety of covert intervention in the affairs
q

i of another country in almost any situation except as may be
incidental to the completion of essential intelligence.
Later, perhaps, Mr. Chairman, I would add two points to

this.

The Chairman. Mr. McNamara, may I just ask before you
‘ continue, because the last sentence you have read happens to
#0 coincide with my own belief that I would like to reread it
and then ask you a question concerning it.

Mr. McNamara, Surely.

The Chairman. In fact, you read, “In fact, I have serious
, doubts about the value or the appropriateness of covert inter-

vention in the affairs of another country in almost any
situation except as may be incidental to the completion
essential intelligence."

Was that your belief at the time you were Secretary of
Defense?

Mr. McNamara. No.

The Chairman. That has come to be your belief since
that vay

Mr. McNamara. Yes. It is based, frankly, on both partic: -

pation in approval of covert action designed to intervene

both on the fact I did participate in authorizing that and in
observing the reaults which IT think were small in relation to
the heavy cost to the country carrying this out, and particular-
ly the cost in terms of -- I am using a-brief statement tetits
will expand on this if you wish == cost in terms of eroding

the credibility of a Democratic Government with its own people.

The Chairman. Yes.

You don't have to expand on that for my benefit, I

agree with you, but I interrrupted you. Do you want to complete
your statement?

Mr. McNamara. The remaining points, Mr. Chairman, I

Mr. McNamara. Y oir.

Mr. Schwarz. Why don't you pull them out so he

them all in front of him.

Going back to your statement, Mr. McNamara --

Mr. McNamara. Yes, gir.

Mr. Schwarz. -- would you state again whether you have
any present recollection of the subject of a sinations
coming up at the August 10, 1962 meeting?

Mr. McNamara. I have no such recollection. 1 should
expand on that to say quite frankly I have no recollection of
the meeting at ‘all. And although I referred-to it in my state~
ment, my recollection or my reference, as I indicated, wi
based on a reconstruction of the events of the time by refer-
ence to documents that you and your associate have shown
me and by conversations with certain of my senior colleagues
who were reported to have been in attendance and by certain
other conversations, including a conversazion with Mr. McCone
and reference to_a memorandum which he had dictated in 1967,
a copy of which he sent me.

‘we. schwarz. T want to come back to what all those,
conversations were.

First, let me make clear what you do or do not now
remember.

Apart from the August 10 meeting, do you now recall thr

Mr. McNamara. I have no recollection of that ever being

raised in any meeting.

Mr. Schwarz. Didyou ever raise the subject of ai

j
| ation, as far as you recall?

Mr. McNamara. I have no recollection of raising it at

any time, and I have talked to four of the people who attended

the August 10 meeting who said they had no recollection of

9 my raising it.

16 When I say that I am aware you have a memorandum from

1: | mr. Harvey you referred to a moment ago which indicates that
:

ie I raised the question on August 10, but I have no recollec-

tion of doing so.

Senator Mondale. We have heard from John McCone who
said that he thought he heard McNamara bring it up; is
that correct?

Let's review the record.

I think what we have heard from some of the participants
is slightly different than what you have said about the main
principals; is that correct?

Do you want to bring this up in some other -- [ think

Senator Mondale. That is right, and Harvey said that.
Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Harvey's memo says that.

Senator Mondale. Did he say he heard it in testimony?
The Chairman. Harvey was present in the meeting.

Mr. Schwarz. I think he confirmed his mamo.

Can I check on Mr. McCone's testimony for a moment?

Senator Mondale. Yes, so you know what he said.
While he is looking, what did Goodwin say?

Mr. Schwarz. Goodwin is going to be examined on Cuba.

Senator Mondale. He hasn't talked about that. What
have the others? Do we have any other direct testimony?
Mr. Schwarz. Rusk said -~

Senator Mondale. Said he did not hear it.

The Chairman. Incidentally, Mr. Secretary, we have nc

any other witness and we would prefer to the best of our

recollection and ability to recount to you other testimony we
have received so you can comment on it and help us try to
ascertain what the truth may be.

Mr. Schwarz. I think I ought to say with respect tc
McCone's testimony, at page 33, you asked Senator’ Mondale,
who mae that suggestion to which you refer in your memo,
and you will recall that McCone's 1967 memo does not attri-

bute the suggestion to any particular person.

McCone answered, according to the record it was Mr.

TOP SECRET



McNamara accotding to Mr. Harvey's record --
Senator Mondale: Do you recall who made the suggestion?
Mr. McCone: No, I can't recall it from memory. I can

‘| only reconstruct it from the ‘record.

Senator Mondale. Is that the only reference?

Mr. Schwarz. I am going ahead and doublechecking
with McCone.

Senator Mondale. Here it is on page 51. He said he
just doesn't know.

Can you testify it was not Secretary McNamara?

McCone: .No; it could have been.

“You just don't know?"

Mr. McConet "I don't know".

Senator Baker. On page 32 there is another colloquy
on the same point you might turn to.

McCone: "I am not sure that McNamara used the word

assassination, he could have used another word, elimination or
removal. And Mr. Harvey in preparing this memorandum
for Helms, who was then Deputy of Plans and Information used
the word assassination rather loosely.”

Might that be the rationale for the situation, might
your views --

Mr. McNamara. 1 don't think it is and I think you
should be very careful in concluding that Mr. McCone recalls

that IT raised the subject at all using the word assasainatios

or elimination. The reason I say that, at the risk of
diverting you for a moment to show you why this is a

matter of great importance to me and why I asked for careful
and precise action by this committee, let me say that I
perhaps more than anyone else, other than Robert Kennedy, have
been charged with approving the concept and/or planning and/or
action related to the assassination of Castro. 1 don't beliove

I ever did approve any of those things. I don't believe I

ever suggested it. None of my senior associates whom I

sy

have talked to can reall it. But I have here a set of

As

clippings from the press in Belgium, Germany, Sweden,

3
ry
:
i

Netherlands, France, Italy and England, which states that I
" aid.
And I have here a statement of the U.S. press, an artic!»
in the Time Magazine of |August 30, which states that McCone
i and another man present, that is to say, at the August 10
meeting, remember McNamara raised the question of disposing
of Castro. And it goes on to imply that I did.
The AP report indicates that Lansdale was my assistant
and presumably acting under my instructions when he wrote the
momorandum you referred to.

The New York Times quoting the AP five days later, by

eur ee yroonny Pere ey

the most unbelievable error, says I wrote the memo to CIA
instructing them to plan the assassination.

Now, this 1s serious to me ad an individual. It is muct:

more serious to the World Bank as an institution as to my
role in the Bank. So, I must ask your forebearance today
if I attempt to be unusually precise on matters. And I want

to conclude by saying that becau of the fime Magazine article

‘
it said McCone remembered, I ra ad this matter, I called

McCone on June 25, and I have given a copy of the memo of

conversation I made after that to members of your staff.

1 And in that conversation, after I related to McCone everything

I knew up to that point which had come from Belin off the

“ Rockefeller Commission and the press and others, including

“a reference to the Harvey momo and all the reat of this --

the memo is in front of you, I asked John if he could add

to my knowledge what took place during or after the August 10
"62 meeting of 54/12 Augmented took place in Dean Rusk's con-
ference room to consider reports.

He remembered the elimination of. Castro was discussed

during the course of the meeting but does not recall whether or
not I raised the subject.

Now, I have read the press that McCone states he re-
calls that he told me. te doesn't recall it.

Senator Hart of Michigan. 1 think in the exchange betwe:
Senator Baker and Senator Mondale the point is made by i
Mr. McCone he has no memory, that all he is reconstructina 15
from the fellow Harvey. This is consistont.

Mr. McNamara. This is exactly my understanding, sir.

TOP SECRET



The Chairman. That is borne out by the transcript:
Mr. McNamara. I think the tranacript indicated I insisted :
asiing this be repeated on the record because I am facing some
: very serious problems around the world beca of lack of un-
. derstanding. of that particular point, and i think misquotcs
of JOhn McCone in Time Magazine.
Mr. Schwarz. The most contemporaneous record, however,
is the August 13 memorandum from Mr. Lansdale which, as you

| know, tasks Mr. Harvey with developing a paper concerning,

among other things, the liquidation of leaders.
Those words were crossed out,
Mr. McNamara. Yos, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. And the August 14 memo about Mr. Harvey

3
s
i
:

that tells us those were the words. It says it wi foolish
* to put it in writing. It says the matter was brought up
at the meeting and was brought up by you.

Now, there isn't any evidence that this matter led to
anything. Indeed, the CIA in their own study of the whole
Castro assassination matter specifically wrote that the
August 10 meeting didn't lead to any of the actual events.

So we are concerned, it scems, with the single issue of what
was the attitude toward assassination expressed at the mectins,
because that does bear upon other ultimate questions we have

to deal with. The attitude is important.

Isn't the best evidence of what happened at the meetinu

the contemporaneous memorandum?

Mr. McNamara. Iam sure that written statements carry |

; more weight than faulty memories. My memory certainly is

faulty over a period. But even the written statement of

Harvey, as I have seen it -- I do not have a copy of it but I
have seen it, your staff showed it to me.

Mr. Schwarz. It is marked as -~

Mr. McNamara. In advance of the hearing.

Mr. Schwarz. Marked as Exhibit 3.

Mr. McNamara, Fven the statement of Harvey's memo
doean't say I proposed assassination of Castro. It saya the
question of assassination of Castro was raised or was up, to
be precise.

I don't wish to try to read into that more than is
appropriate, but it doesn't say I proposed it, and I am not
about to say I proposed it. I have no recollection of it.
The four senior associates I have talked with, Messrs.
Taylor, Bundy, Gilpatric and Rusk, have no recollection of m:
raising it. It is entirely out of character with what I believe
I thought at the time and I do not read into that those words
a statemont I did propose it.

Senator Baker. Could I say a word?

I think page 33 of the McCone testimony is helpful in
this respect.

As the Chairman says, we are not trying to push anybod

in a corner, trapping the witn + we are trying to find the
baseline minimum of what was said with respect to assassina-
tion or elimination of leaders. My interpretation of the record
so far is that it is alleged, and I believe proven with good
evidence, both verbal testimony and documentary evidence,

that the subject proposale came up at that meeting, but not
beyond the shadow of a doubt that it was said by the Secretary.

Let me tell you why I said that.

Page 33 of McCone's testimony is as follows:

"I take it then that according to your best recollection
the subject of liquidating Castro and possibly other top
Cuban leaders did come up at that meeting and you did take
strong exception to it?"

McCone: "Yes."

So it seems clear to me McCone does remember independentiy
the subject coming up.

To continue with McCone's answer:

“Y was not alone in that. Mr, Murrow took exception.

I rememver that very clearly.”

It seems to me the baseline minimum is that apparently
the subject did come up and was shot down. We have only the
remaining question of whether or not the witness before us
now brought it up or someone else did.

Then the question I will put to Mr. McNamara, do you

remember it coming up?

TOP SECRET



Mr. McNamara. I do not remember it coming up.
Mr. Schwarz. One further question I think,was it shot
| down or not at the meeting, and in that connection Mr. Lansdale
dia send out a memo tasking the CIA?

Do you believe Mr. Lansdale would have sent out a memor-
andum tasking the CIA to investigat as a contingency liquida-
tion of leaders if the matter had in fact been shot down at

| the meeting?

Mr. McNamara. Mr. Schwarz, I would rather not answer

that. I have certain knowledge of Mr. Lansdale, General Lans-
dale, but I would rather not comment upon whether he would or

not. I will report to you what I know with respect to that memo

based on what Mr. McCone told me what his memo says, but I

would rather not speculate on Lansdale's willingness to in-
|, dependently suggest that.
The Chairman. Mr. McNamara, I think it is important for
the committee to at least have the benefit of yur opinion.
on an issue that is as central to our inquiry as this, be-
cause we are confronted with a memorandum that Lansdale wrote
soon after the meeting in which he instructs or directs CIA
to at least inquire into schemes for liquidating foreign leu:
Wasn't that the term?
Mr. Schwarz. Liquidation ~- including liquidation of
leaders,

The Chairman. Including liquidation of leaders.

TOP SECRET



Will you read the whole sentence? i

Mr. Schwarz. You have to put the two together. But it
would read:

"Papers required from each of you for the Tuesday meeting:
Mr. Harvey, intelligence political (splitting the. regime, in-
" eluding liquidation of leaders,) economic sabotage limited.”

-The Chairman, Do you have that before you?

Mr. McNamara, I do.

-The Chairman. Notice at the beginning of this Lansdale
memorandum is the following. The first sentence is “In com-
Pliance with the dosires and guidance expressed in the 10
August policy meeting of operation MONGOOSE".

Then he goes on to instruct Mr. Harvey as indicated.

Now, we know the words that are deleted from this
memorandum have been since supplied to the committee, were the
including liquidation of leaders.

i Now, if General Lansdale thought that the group had
given him such authority, that could have been based upon a mi..-
understanding of the group's intentions, or it could have been
an enlargement of his instructions. We don't know for sure
what it was, But there it is and I think you ought to respu:
to the question as best you can.

Mr. McNamara. Woll, T should tell you that at the momer

I am so personally annoyed at Genoral Lansdale for what 1

consider loose and irresponsible and at times contradictory

testimony in the press, in the whole matter in the last three or;
four weeks, I don't feel I can speak in a fair manner with
respect to him and I don't beopose to.

The Chairman. Then can you tell the committee apart
from --

Mr. McNamara. I take it those in the room will hold this

in confidence.

Ed Lansdale is a fine human being. I am damn annoyed

at the damage he has done to dead people. I am not an unbi

reporter on Ed Lansdale's motives.
The Chairman. I can understand your feeling.

But apart from General Lansdale and any fewlinga you

| may have toward him, can you give the committee any explana-

tion, any other explanation of why such words should have
appeared in that?

Mr. McNamara. No, I cannot. It seems to me inconsistent
with what McCone has told mo and what your record shows McCone
said and what McCone reports Ed Murrow as having said, and
the general tone of the August 10 meeting as it has beeen
reported to me, I can give you no explanation.

Senator Mondale. Did you say earlier that you had cal.
McCone when you saw the Lansdale memo and objected to that
language and it was then deleted?

Mr. McNamara. No; I reported that when I read the Time

Mayazine report dated June 30, 1975 ==

Senator Mondale. Then you called him?

Mr. McNamara. — That reported McCone as saying that I or
he recalled that I initiated a suggestion relating to the
elimination of Castro. I called McCone and at that time he
told me that he had brought this matter to my attention after
he, McCone, had seen the Lansdale memo in 1962, and that he,
McCone, objected to the language in the Lansdale memo, and
McCone reported to me in 1975 that I, too, objected very

strongly and vigorously to it in 1962.

Concurrently with McCone talking to mo in 1962, Harvey
i
' was apparently talking to Lansdale, according to McCone,

and as 4 result of Harvey's discussion with Lansdale the

‘ words were excised from the memorandum. But in any case

" MeCone and 1, 60 HcCone says, agreed that there would be no
action of the kind contemplated by the Lansdale memo, no
planning of any such action.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. McNamara, in refreshing
your own recollection you referred to a conversation, your
recent conversation with Mr. McCone, and in that connection
the fact that he had done a memorandum for the files, I think
you said April 14 or August 14 '67 --

Mr. McNamara. April 14, I believe.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Po you know in what connect:

he did that memorandum?

Mr, McNamara. I can relate to you what he told me

TOP SECRET

'



relating to the memorandum, This is from a memorandum I
made of my June 25, 1975, conversation with him,
i Mr. Schwarz. That is Tab § of the McNamara book.
Mr. McNamara. The last paragraph -- if you have copies
of that in front of you <= Item E states in 1967, following a

*
conversation with Jack Anderson held at Ted Kennedy

request,
he, Mr. McCone, prepared a memo of conversation which referred
to some of the events surrounding the August 10, '62, meeting:

but that contrary to the impr

ion I had received from

Dillon and others the momo did not refer to me. He will
send me a copy of the 'memo next Monday when he returns to his
office in Los Angelon.

That was his recollection on June 25, 1975 when I called’

him, at which time he was in Seattle. The memo was, he
thought, in his office in Los Angeles. :

As it turns out, he was in error in one respect be-
cause the memo did refer to me, and when he sent it to me t
subsequently discovered that.

In any case, the origin of the April 14, 1967, McCone
memo apparently was a conversation ‘he had with Jack Anderson

at the time,

Senator Hart of Colorado. Thank you.

my remark by saying that I personally think who raised
question of assa..ination is now not immaterial, but I think
the fact that it has now been astablished to my satisfaction
that the question was raised, that probably meets the needs of
the committee as far as I am concerned and I am not interested

lly in pointing out or establishing precisely who did or
aian't.

But there is one point that’ I would like for you to
comment on,

Following the minutes of the meeting on August 10, we
have a number of memoranda which have already been reforred
to, and as the Chairman has pointed out, the memorandum of
August 13 from Lansdale, which was just three days after the
meeting, starts off, as our Chairman so well pointed out,

“In compliance with the desires and guidance expressed in
the 10 August policy meeting”. >

I note, it seoms to me, just three days afterward, it
would be unlikely that he would write that into a memorandum
if he did not feel that that was actually his instructions,
and disseminate that memorandum,

Then when you go following that memorandum, that is the
one you recall that he usod the words that were later exciset.

The very next day we have the Harvey memorandum which
takes General Lansdale to task for raising the question of

assassination, Hut then he goes on to say that “I was present’

or “I took careful notes on the commants at this meeting on
the point", and so on. :

He says a question of assassination, particulariy of
Fidel Castro, was brought up by Secretary McNamara at the
meeting of the Special Group, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
And the last sentence of a paragraph is “I took careful
notes".

Now, add to that the Inspector General's report that

| was made in 1967, which waa seven years ago, which says --

does he havo a copy of that? It is under Tab Cc.

The Inspector General report starts off saying that
Tom Parrott's minutes of the meeting make no mention of the
subject of assassination. Both McCone and Ilarvey recall that
McNamara raised the question or raised the subject.

Harvey's notes taken at the meoating show that
it was also mentioned by Murrow but the nature of the comment
was not- recorded, Mr. McCone states in the memorandum 14 April
‘67, that he recalls meetings on 8 or 9 of August in Joint
Chief's operation room in Pentagon, and on August 10 in the
section, and so forth, at one ‘of these meetings and McCone
now recalls it at JCS the suggestion was made that top people
in the Cuban regime, including Castro, be, liquidated.

Now, thia memorandum was made, as I say, seven, eight
years ago 1t tho time when it ‘seema that Mr. McCone's

memory would be probably more koen than it is at the present

TOP SECRET



And would you not agree that those three documents
would indicate that perhaps you did raise the question?

Mr. McNamara. Not at all. Not at all and I think --

TOP SECRET



Senator Morgan, Would you tell me why?

Mr. McNamara. Yes, because if you wish to put heavy
weight on what happened eight years ago -~ read McCone's
memo of April 14, '67 --

Senator Morgan. All right, leave that out.

Mr. McNamara. You can't leave it out. That is part of
eight years ago.

Senator Morgan. Let me leave it out for the purpose

of my question, if you will, please.

Why would General Lansdale only three days after the
meeting in a memorandum prepared for general circulation make
such a atatement and thon the next day Mr. Harvey, the fourth

day after, make such a statement and say that he made notes

3
&
i

of it

Mr. McNamara. Well, I am just addressing your question
to me, which, if I misstated correct me -- your question is
do not those three memoranda support the contention that 1
raised the question of assassination. 1 don't think they do

Senator Norgan. [ agree. I will accept your answer on
that.

Thinking back and just take the two memoranda made the
third and fourth days after the meeting, both of which had
general circulation, were not made in secret, were not kept

in separate files but generally curculated.

For instance, Lansdale's was circulated to llarvey, to *

State Department, to General Benjamin Harris, Defense. Who

was ha?

Mr. McNamara. lie must havo been a representative of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I don't recall him.

Senator Morgan. Lon Wilson.

It ms to me tho two memoranda that quickly after
that meeting for general circulation would tend to indicate
that certainly in their minds and according to their notes

that you did raise the question.

Mr. McNamara. Lansdale's memorandum makes no reference
to me whatever as having raised the question so --

Senator Morgan. But it notes the question was raisod.

Mr. McNamara. But it doesn't indicate I raised it,
and it certainly indicates I support it and not even the
Harvey Memo indicates I support it. The Harvey memo simply
says I raised the question. I could have rained tho questior
in opposition.

I don't mean to be trying to read into these statements
words that aren't there, but I must be vory careful. I have
no recollection of it, my sonior associates have no recollect
ion of it, it is totally inconsistent with my moral standar.:
“now and then.

Senator “organ. Your moral standards have changed a !
now from what they were?

Mr. McNamara. ‘lot my moral standards.

2423461 Page 32


_ Senator Morgan. Your willingness to engage in
activity?

Mr. McNamara. But not for moral reason: For perfectly
practical political reasons and associated with the view of
Domecracy. But I don't mean to be nit-picking with you on
this point, but it is a very important point to me, and there
is nothing in the Lansdale memorandum that in any way indi-
cates I raised or supported tho issuc of assassination. And
the important point, if I may continue, sir, is that I didn't
know of that memo before it was sent out, so McCone says.
When he brought it to my attention, I immediately agreed
with him there should be no consideration of assassination.
It is unlikely I would have said that then if I had beon
in. support of it two days earlier.

Senator Morgan. fir. McNamara, as I said earlier, I
think it is really immaterial and I don't moan to be nit-
picking but I am simply not willing to accept your statement,
in the light of the hard evidance that we have that as a
matter of fact you did not raise it.

Mr. McNamara. It may be immaterial to you whether I
raised it. It isn't immaterial to me, gentlemen, and I know
of no hard evidence you have that T supported assassination

of Castro.

Senator Morgan, No question of supporting it, the que

of raising the question.

That is why I used the word support,
because the only evidence you have is from a Mr. Harvey
whom as far as I know, I don't know, who says I raised the
question. That is a long way from supporting.

T don't want to jump to the conclusion that I even
raised it, but in any event there is no evidence you have
that I supported it and it sounds like nit-picking and
I don't want to waste your time on it, but it is not nit-
Picking to me, this is my life and I am not about to --

The Chairman. It doesn't sound like nit-picking to mo,
Mr. Mewamara. It is a terribly important point for you. I
think it is an important point’ from the Hank, the institution
you represent, and I regret very,much that there has been
such an assortment of statement in the press about this
matter. We live with that every day but this Committee
has been very careful to avoid leaks.

Mr. McNamara. You should be proud of it; you have.

The Chairman. Thank you.

Mr. Schwarz. I think it may be helpful in light of

the discussion of the meeting to read into the record what

the CIA said, not about who raised it but about what happened
in connection with it.

Senator Morgan. What are you reading from?

Mr. Schwarz, From Page 118 of the CIA Inspector Gener i!

Report.

TOP SECRET



Senator Morgan. We don't have that.
Mr. Schwarz. It's not in there and this is a two

|| column set of rather cryptic conclusions that has on the left-!

| hand column published detailes or unpublished details, and

on the right-hand column the facts as we know them.
i

On this subject the following is stated in the left-hand

column unpublished details.

The Chairman. Does the witness have this hefore him?

Mr. Schwarz. No, he does not bacauso we didn't copy it.

Mr. McNamara, I will follow it orally.

Mr. Schwarz. The left-hand column unpublished’ detail
there was a meeting at the Department of stata in which the
assassination of Castro.was discussed. Then under the right-
hand column under the heading facts as we know them, true,
the subject was raised at a meeting at State on 10 August
1962 but it related to any actual attempts of assassination.
It did result in MONGOOSE action memorandum by Lansdale
assigning to CIA action for planning liquidation of leaders.

The offending phrase was later exercised from copies

forwarded to CIA, State Department and USIA, but tho danger
may have already been done.

Senator Schweiker. Mr. Chairman.

You say, Mr. Secretary, there is no evidence that suqgests

affirmative decision was made, yet the memorandum that we ar:

AO Fee Meee SE Rann

talking about was written on the assumption, in fact, the groan

TOP SECRET



that you were in did make that decision and did proceed
about, and the only correction that was made for the record
was that it was corrected to the point that they didn’t want
to talk about 1t but they were going forward with it.

That is exactly what the evidence is that we have, and
while you may contradict the évidence, we do have evidence
of that.

Mr. McNamara. I am contradicting the evidence or Iam
saying I don't sce any evidence that you have that indicates
1 supported assassination of Castro. That is. number one.

Number two: McCone's memory apparentyl in '67 and
certainly in the memo he wrote in '67 indicates that he astro:
opposed assassination at the time, and I strongly opposed
planning for assassination at the time.

That is in writing before you. I think that ia rather
clear evidence that the two of us would not have directed
or supported or accepted planning of the assassination of

Castro. I know of no contrary evidence.

Senator Schweiker. The contrary evidence is that they o*

going ahead and planning on that basis and only should ¢
reference to the planning and operation be deleted, and the
“fact it wag on the assumption that that group did support
the assassination.

I don't want to nit-pick either but 1 think we ought to

keep the record atraitht.

TOP SECRET



Mr. McNamara. I haven't sean the evidence, to use your
phrase, they were going ahead and planning on that basis.

As a matter of fact, I heard the counsel read a statement
from the CIA Inspector General which indicates they were not
going ahead and planning on that basis.

Number 2, McCone's objection to the letter was not, or
to the Lansdale memo, was not to the written statement that
thay should plan. His objection was to any planning and
my opjection was to any planning and his memo makes that very
leoar. 1 am relying on his mamory, not mine, but the memo
was written in ‘67 and is very clear on those points.

Senator Schweiker. Haven't you seen the Harvey meno?

Naan't the staff shown you the Harvey memo?

Mr. McNamara. I havo seen the Harvey memo and that
gives no indication that the meeting of August 10 approved
the planning or the action to assassinate Castro. It says
in a very ambiguous way that McNamara raised the question
unquote and doesn't indicate whether I raised it to dismiss
it, to object to it or to support it.

Senator Schweiker. I would like to reread it.

Upon receipt of attached memorandum I callod -- this is
Operation MONGOOSE. Operation MONGOOSF as I understand it
wan being directed by a man under you, General Lansdale.

Senator Schweiker. Who was he under?
Mr. McNamara. le was under the Committee, he was working

the Interagency Committee. He was not taking instructions

tus 7s.

Senator Schweiker. What role did you have in Operation
MONGOOSE?

Mr. McNamara, If I may digress just a second, I am not
entirely clear on the organizational structure at the time.
But as I understand it, there wore several committees involved
in covert actions. One was the 5412 Group. So far as I know
they were not concerned with MONGOOSE. The second was tho
Special Group. My understanding of the Special Group is

that they were a group responsible for considering counter-

insurgency actions. I was not a momber of either the $412 grou:

or Special Group.

Senator Schweiker. He was only a Deputy, a member of
either group?

Mr. McNamara. Yes, sir.

Senator Schweiker. And in fact did represent you?

Mr. McNamara, Yes, did represent me. And let me digress
again to say whatever my Deputy did I assumo responsibility
for. 1 had an extremely close relationship with them. 1 can
not believe he did anything of any importance they didn't
discuss with mg. If am fully prepared to accept full respon:

sibility for whatever my Doputy did in those two. In any

TOP SECRET

2423461 Page



event neither one as far as I know had anything to do with

MONGOOSE.

Thon there was what I understand to be a Special Group

MONGOOSE. And I am told that General Lansdale was acting as
Program director for that Special Group. He was taking
directions from that committee and not from me. But I am
sorry, sir, I interrupted you.

Senator Schweiker, That is all right.

I think 4t 48 important’ to set the record streight on
that.

Paragraph four of the memo saya: “Upon receipt of
the attached memorandum I called Lansdale's office and in
his absence pointed out to Frank Hand the inadmissibility and
stupidity of putting this type of comment in writing in such
a document. I advised. Frank Hand as far as CIA was concerned
we would write no document pertaining to this and. would
participate in no open meeting erepeer rer it. I strongly
urged Nand to recommend to Lansdale that he excise the phrasc
in question from all copies of this memorandun, including
those disseminated to State, Defense and USIA. Shortly ther
after Lansdale called back and left the mesnage that he agree!
he had done so. ‘

Now, the point of this whole thing is that he isn't
blowing the whistle and saying we agreed not to assassinate

Castro or that wan a misconception, he is saying juat delete

it and delete it in the copy that your office had, but no
reference at all about going wrong or not doing it or what

all, 80 the assumption certainly is vory clear to the authority
of the memo it was to go ahead but not call it that. I don't
see how you-can say there is no contradictory evidence. You
may disagree and say it is wrong, but there certainly 1s.

Mr. McNamara, AGain, I don't want to be nit-picking.

We ought to be clear what I am disagreeing with. (a) I am
disagreeing with any statement that there is evidence that
I proposed or supported or authorized the preparation of

Plans or any action relating to the assassination-of Castro.

I know of no such evidence.

(>). 1 agree that this language in paragraph four of

:

Mr. Harvey's memo of 14 August is ambiguous. It would be
consistent with the CIA having prior to August 10 been
Planningassassination, and it would be consistont with them
continuing to do so afterward, But I call ijoue attention to
the fact it doesn't say that. It states .it only reports to,
only relates to the discussion of assassination. It doesn't
say we are not: requesting to discuss it. We are going to
go ahead and do it. I think one has to be very, very caret
in reading this language.

The Chairman. Senator Schweiker, were you finished?

Senator Schweiker. Yes

vhe Chairman. 1 think that it may be well to point ou:

the delimma that faces this Committes.

We have received your testimony that you at no time,
neither at the August 10 meeting nor any other time, advo-
cated or approved, discussed, or undertook to authorize the

ssination,of Castro; io that correct?

Mr. McNamara. That is correct.

Senator Baker. Stop a second. Let's try to deal very
preciscly because I want to listen carefully. Discussed --

you intend discussed to be in there?

Mr. McNamara. I have no recollection of ever discussing

Senator Baker. I was relating that back to
disagreement. Surely that is a discussion of it.
Mr. McNamara. Well, I didn't state that I disagreed

with it. In discussions.

Senator’ Baker. I an trying to help, not

Mr. McNamara. I know you are and --

Senator Baker. Let discuss out and it will make me fu
better.

Mr. McNamara. 1 would be happier to have discuss out’
because there is evidence from Harvey that I did discuss it
and I would bo happier to have it out tco, sir. But, I hav
no recollection of {t and none of my senior associates have

recollection of it.

The Chairman. We also have received evidence from you:

TOP SECRET

“Page


senior associates that they never participated in the

authorization of an assassination attempt against Castro

nor ever directed the CIA to undertake such attempts.

We have much testimony establishing the chain of command
whore covert action was concerned, and all of it has bee
to the effect that the Special Group or tho Special Group
Augmented had full charge of covert operations, and that in
that chain of conmand any proposal of this character or any
other proposal having to do with covert operations being
diroctad against the Castro regime, or against Castro personall-.
were to ba “laid before the Spocial Group Auqmented and were nor.
to ‘be undertaken except with the authority of that group and 3°.
the direction of that aroup.

tiow, at the same time we know from the evidence that
the CIA was in fact engaged during the period in a series o!
attempts. to assassinate Castro.

Now, you see what wo are faced with is this dilemma.
Either the CIA was a rogue elephant rampaging out of contro!.
over which no effective direction was being qiven.in this
matter of assassination, or there was sone secret channel
circumventing the whole structure of command by which the <
and certain officials in the CIA were authorized to procee.|
with assassination plots and assassination attempts aqains!

Castro. Or the third and final point that [ can think of

is that somehow these officials of the .CIA who ware so

TOP SECRET



engaged misunderstood or misinterpreted their scope of author-

ity.

Not it is terribly important, if there is any way
that we can find out which of these three points represented
what actually happened. That is the nature, that is the
quandary.

Now, is there anything that you can tell us that would

assist us in finding ah answer to this central question?

Mr. McNamara. I can only tell you what will further
your uncasiness. Because I have stated before and I believe
today that the CIA was a highly disciplined organization,
fully under the control of sanior officials of the government,
0 much so that I feel as a senior official of the governnen
I must assume the responsibility for the actions of the tx9,
putting assassination aside just for the moment, But I know
of no major action taken by CIA during the time I was in the
government that was not properly authorized by senior officials.
And when I say that I want to omphasize also that I believes
with hindsight we authorized actions that were contrary to
the intereat of the Republic but I don't want it on the
record that the CIA was uncontrolled, was operating with
its own authority and we can be absolved of responsibility
for what CIA did, again with exception of assassination, again
which I say I never heard of.

The second point you say that you have, you know that Cf.

was engaged in a ceries of attempts of assassination. I
think to use your words. I don't know that. I accept the
fact that you do and that you have information I was not
aware of. I find that impossible ten I just can't
understand how it could have happened and I don't accept
the third point, that they operated on the basis of misunder-
standing, bec, @ it seems to me the McCone position that he
was opposed to it, his clear recollection and his written
momo of 1967 that I was strongly opposed to it, his state-
ment that Murrow was opposed, all should eliminate any
point of misunderstanding. So I frankly can't reconcile.

The Chairman. Just to give you some further information.
We also have very ‘hard evidonce that McCone was not told about
the assassination efforts directed against Mr. Castro and

that liclms agreed not to --

CIA on the question of liquidating foreign leaders. It wasn't
an order to liquidate any foreign leaders. Nor did Harvey
at that meeting advise anybody what he was doing.

So we are presented with the possibility that we had somc
froe-wheeling operating on their own. Wo don't know.

Senator Baker. Could I say a word in that respect?

The Chairman. Yes. Would you like to comment at this
point?

Mr. McNamara. No, I will hear the Senator, then try to
explain.

Senator Baker. To heighton your dintross or discomfort
a little mora, I know in tho opaning lines of the Inspector
General's report dated 25 April '67 are these -- the Committe:
has heard me read them before. “The reconstruction of the
Agency's involvement and plans to assassinate Fidel Castro
is at best an imperfect history. Because of the extreme
sensitivity of the operations being discussed or attempted
as a metter of principle, no official records were kept of
planning, of approvals nor of implemontation.”

So, you sec, in addition to the almost irreconciable
alternutives that we have suggested to you, we have an exti
of policy by CIA that no document should reflect this, ant
implying clearly if plans were mada that wa will doty you ti
find them.

Quoting from the IG report. “Former Attorney General
Robert Konnedy was fully priefod by Houston and Edwards on
7 May '62. Momorandum confirming the oral briefing was forwarded
to Kennedy on ] May '62." The memorandum does not wu!
the word “assassination,” but there is little room for
misinterprotation of what it meant.
Presumably the original of that momo is still in the

files of the Justice Department. It should ba noted the

briefing of Kennedy was restricted to Phase I operation which

had ended about a year earlier. Phase II was already under
way at the time of the briefing but Kennedy was not told of it.

The Chairman. I think that latter part which Senator
Baker was fair enough to include, together with some testinon,
that corroborates the fact, indicates at one point the
Attorney General was briefed about Phase I of the operation
having to do with an attempt against Castro's life, but was
briefed in such a manner that he Was lead to believe that that
was over, that was over, and was not told at that bricfiny
that this was a Phase II, a new effort then underway to
assassinate Castro.

Mr. Mctamara. tr. Chairman, May I make one comment Ww:

and I had no previous knowledge of what & have just heard,
it sounds to me that something I still can't conceive ui
going on, tha the CIA had been planning assassinations
and perhaps attompting assassinations against Castro for some
considerable period of time prior to August 10.

The Chairman. That is correct.

10 August, it was the obvious consensus at the meeting in answ

Senator Baker's point. I took careful . notes on the comments
at this meeting on the point these notes ara four days old

comments or study on this point. We couldn't have more diroct

Mr. McNamara. (a). I have no notes. (b). I think
this ambiquous sentence can be read in a variety of ways.

assassination attempts and were opposed to it. and wanted it

Mr. Mctlamara. On the Lansdale matter, I don't want to
speculate on his motives or what he would do or wouldn't do
without authority. .[ would repeat to you only two points.
(a). That your staff showed me a memo indicating he had been
detached ‘rom the assignment to the Pertagon, in sometime,

I forget whether it was late ‘61 or carly ‘62 to work for tt

Defense during the period we are discussing, and secondly,

I will report a conversation I had with General Lansdale,

simply referring to notes I made at the time.

The Chairman. When did this take place?

Mr. McNamara. I am just trying to f1nd the exact date.
It was in reference to one of these newspaper articles.
Give me a moment to find the particular reference.

A fow woaks ago on the issue of whom he received his
instructions from.

On the 30th of May, two conversations in the same day.
This is bocause of a most unusual situation but let me refor
to that becuase it relatos to this. It also shows my
problem.

On May 24, the AP and Washington Star reported relatiny
to the August 19 meeting, that I had been thera, and that
it then says, AP says, while one source who has seen tho
minutes said the subject was immediately dismissed, i.e.,
Planning of assassination of Castro, two sources say a memo
was written two days later and by assistant to then Secretar
ef Mefense McNamara directing the CIA to develop contingency
plans for a possible assassination of the Cuban leader.

By the most amazing error, six days later the ‘lew Yor
Times in anvarticle on the Mafia and the CIA, buried” door
in the article, states, quoting the AP: "The Rockefeller

Commission who had obtained minutes of a meeting on Auqust

TOP SECRET



attended by the Secretary of Defense McNamara, Rusk, MeCone,
Bundy, the meeting," the AP reports said, “included
discussion of killing Mel Castro." One source told the AP
the matter was immediately dismissed but the wire service
quoted two other sources. This is the important point. -The
wire service, AP, quoted two other sourced who said a memo
was written two days later by McNamara directing the CIA to
Prepare contingency plans for the elimination of Castro.

Neodless to say, whan I read that I was deeply upset.

Lat me complete this, if I may, Mr. Schwoiker, then come

back because this is a complete misstatement of what the

AP said.

I was concerned enough when I read the AP because the

1

>

implication was that Lansdale wrote the memorandum under
my direction, as Assistant to McNamara he must have been
reporting to me, he nee have taken instructions from me an!,
therefore, I was responsible for Lansdale's memo. But I have
learned enough about this kind of problem to know that to
try to get this point cleared was going to’make a two-day
story out of a one, so frankly, I didn't recall the AP on t®:

On the 30th of May we qet this kind of story. I was 80 u;

I called HWorrick, under whose byline this appeared, and
sought to correct it, and he was shocked when I read it to

him. He hadn't head the printed version of the story. te

said that 4a not the story I filed.~ The AP made clear you

Page 52


you didn't write it, Lansdale wrote it. I have to talk to
my editors. And he talked to them and called me back and
said it ia a horrible error and we will correct it, and I
don‘*t know whether they have or not, I haven't seen a correction.
But assume for a ninute they have. I said when you correct
it correct the impression Lansdale wrote the memo under my
instruction because ho was not operating for ma at the timo.
I learned this in the interim. Norrick said no, wo can't
correct that, wo can only correct our misquote of ‘the AP.
1 said correct that and I will talk to the AP. nefore I
talk to the AP to bo damned sure I was right, because my
memory is very bad about this period, I called three people.
I called Max Taylor, Roswell Gilpatric and Lansdale to find
out who ‘Lansdale worked for and who he was taking instructions
from at the time, and it was with respect to that I will now
answer your question.

My call to Lansdale, I. made two calls to Lansdale on May
39, and my note says, in answer to my question, Lansdale
said he was not working for me at the time ofthe August 1,
‘ez meeting, but then I would rather hot say what else he

said becaune I think it is wrong, for somebody else, and I

probed him on it and ho said not exactly something elae, anc

1 probed him and got something else later on in the same day
1 called AP and reported all this to them except T said that

taking instructions from me. They said they would report
that, correct the misstatement, correct the statement. But
when they reported that they would have to report their source
for the story. And I said I don’t give a damn, report your
source. By the way, who was it? They said it was Lansdale.

I said you had better damned woll get on the telephone and

talk to Lansdale because I just talked to him and he said I

was not instructing him at the time. I said, furthermore,

when you call Lansdale and you ask him whether he was

taking inatructions from me with respect to that memorandum,
if he leaves you with any doubt on the matter, you call me
back because I want to sit down with the two of you in porson

that afternoon and get this straightenad out. I am quite

clear Lansdale was not working for me, wasn't. taking instruct -
fons from me, I didn't have a damn thing to do with the memo —
and I don't want any misunderstanding on {t. 1 am not trying
to hand it on Lansdale, I want to make this clear, I want
to make it perfectly clear ho wasn't working for mo.

That was about three o'clock on Friday afternoon. 1
heard nothing more of it.

T would just aa soon have this off the record.

Mr. McNamara. The piece of paper that your staff showed

me indicates that sometime, I think it is in the latter part
of '61, at White House direction, he was assigned to work for
an interagency group that was planning and perhaps authorizing
covert action against the Government of Cuba.

In any case, he didn't work for me. That was the thing I

us. Now, I think that Senator Baker's question is pertinent
becauso what Lansdale told you bears upon his credibility.
Ne has been before us, wo know what he has told us, and we
havo had various appraisals given this Committee of Lansdale
by people who know him very wall. He claims he has been
misquoted in the press. In unsworn tastimony he did not
charge Robert Kennedy with having given him instructions as .
to assinate Castro.

Now, that in tho attuation. If you could tell us
what he told you it would help us {n our evaluation of the
testimony he has given the Committee.

Senator Baker. Thank you very much.

Let mo simply say for Mr. McNamara, let me make a
Statement that I think the Committee fully understands but
I want him to understand.

In the course of my career in the Senate, I have never
been involved in a situation of such great sensitivity as
this situation. In the course of this inquiry I think one
of the most remarkable attributes of this Committce has hee:
it& calm in the fact of coordinated circumstance unfolding
and unlikely paradox that appear before us. 1 think that ever
member of the Committee will aqrae that no effort has been
made so far tu sully the reputation of any living or deat

and that the temptation to do so for partisan purposes has

TOP SECRET



been totally and completely and effectually resisted. No
one is attempting to do _that now. The committee knows: it and
I want to know it.

Mr. Chairman, I would like the witness to answer the
question.

Mr. McNamara. I have tried not to sully anyone's repu-
tation and I haven't commented to the press except my own
reputation being sullied, and one of the reasons I haven't
is that until the full story gets out, explanations of
Partial partisan {s bound to stimulate other partisan reapon-
ses and it simply perpetuates this speculation about
indivisuals, some of them dead, and others incapable of
defending themselves. S0 I have been very careful what I
have said.

Now, I will answer, your questions, since you know more
than’ I do-already about Lansdale, I think in this, situation

But in answer to my question, to him as to whom he works :
for, he said he worked for a committee and the chairman of
the committee, but this was only after I asked him about the

memo relating to the August 10 discussion that was referre.!

to in the press as stating that Lansdale asked CIA to prepar

an assassination plan. [ said who gave you the instruction.

to prepare that memo and hin reply to me was the Presiden:
And I said now, Ed, don't tell me that. Are you suggestis

that you were in the presence of the President and he gave

TOP SECRET



that inatruction? I said I don't believe it.

Now, this is to disagree a second. That was a telephone |
eall. I know Lansdale well, The last time I saw Lansdale
personally, to the best of my knowledge, was in Saigon.
Ellsberg was with him, civilian and dreased in combat fatigues
with a 45 caliber pistol on his belt and two of them were
Playing God knows what gamos.

T haven't seon him from then .to now. So I tracked him
down to raise this question. And he said, in response to
who authorized that memo -- he said the President. So I said,
Ed, don't kid me now. I can't believe that you were in the
Prasonce of the President and he authorized you to send that
mamo to CIA. to said, no, that wasn't exactly it. 1 said

the President. I am not trying to put words in your mouth.

I want to know what happened. The first thing I have got
to get clear, it wasn't me, and he said that is clear, it
wasn't you, and the second thing I have got to got clear,

you weren't working for me, fle said that is clear, I was

working for the committee and the Chairman, and the third
thing T want to get, who did authorize vou to do it? He

said, okay, it wasn't the President. I said who was it.

President. linally I dropped it, This is all on the tale-

it wasn't the President. And then I went back to the AP,

and it was at that point the AP said woll their authority for
printing in effect ho was my Assistant and I authorized him, 1
said you had better'darn well gat him on the telephone,

which is what they did, and this is what, intervenod between
three o'clock and the time Ethel called my wife and my wife

called mo. Three hours fourty-five minutes later AP went

back on Lansdale and according to AP Lanadale in a sense

gave thom the same point, the President authorized it.

Said it was ultimately the Prasident. The AP reporter was
smart enough to know that is unlikely, not really the
President, {t was a high intermediary. At this point you
get two stories. Tt. may be two different reporters. One of
them said was the high intermediary McGeorge Bundy, and Lanada!-:
said no, it wasn't McGeorge Bundy, it was higher than that.
And the reporter said well, I guess the only person higher
than that could have been Robert Mennedy. Is it a fair
assumption it was him? And Lansdale said that is a -- 1
not quite certain now the exact words, but something,
well that is a conclusion one could draw, or some such thin
ag that, and it was from that that the Cus qot, that story

people --

Tho Chairman, We know what has been going on, Mr.

McNamara, and we have heard Mr. Lansdale's testimony under
oath that it was not Bobby Kennedy and that he was
misconstruad in the press.

All right, Mr. Schwarz, would you continue with the
quoationing.

Mr. Schwarz. Would you look at the Exhibit 1, again
which are minutes of the meeting of Auguat 10, and read
into the record from tho page 2 as far as this in at 38 B
in the Lansdale Book -- what is reported on a subject that
is not assassination, what is reported thet you said on
another subject.

Mr. McNamara. Yes, paragraph 5 on page 2 of the memo
indicates that discussion then turned to the objectives. of
the MONGOOSE program. McNamara questioned whethor we can not
separate the building up of agent assets within Cuba from
action that would hurt the U.S. in the eyes of the world
opinion. This lead to the suggestion by General Taylor we
should consider changing the overall objective from one of
overthrowing the Castro regime to one of bausing its Visible
faulure.

Mr, Schwarz, Tt suggests you were concernad about

something, you wanted the U.S. not to do things that would!

TOP SECRET



hurt it in the eyes of the world opinion.

Do you have any recollection whatsoever what you had
in mind? :

Mr. McNamara, I don't. I believe by August 10, 1962
that the Bay of Pigs operation was a total disaster, an error
in every sense of the word, and certainly would have
opposed any military action of that kind. As a matter of
fact, 60 days after that August 10 meeting, during the Cuban
missile crisis, I strongly opposed military intervention in
Cuba bacause I thought it would kill several thousand
Cubans, kill several thousand Americans, run the risk of
Soviet response in some arca of the world and danger the
U.S. in the eyes of the world opinion. So by this time I
had learned the error of my support of the lay of Pigs of
@ year and a half carlier and I was quite conscious of the
desirability of avoiding actions that would hurt the U.S.,
but quite frankly, I have’no recollection of what those
actions were. .

Nr.Schwarz. In the MONGOOSE program, it is correct,
is it not, that the MONGOOSE program was a program which wa
fully authorized hy the President?

Mr. McNamara. 1 believo so.

Let me start out again, You showed me or one of your

associates showed me a meno late 1961 establishing an oriqi::

structure for carrying out what was later called the MONGOD:'

TOP SECRET



Program. I don't know whether the memo referred to it as
such and I am sure, therefore, that the program in the sense
of the original structure and action to consider what could
be done to weaken the Cuban. regime was authorized by the

Prasident. I don't wish to imply that whatever actions we

took, and I have lost recollection what they were -- I
don't want to imply avery one of those individual actions

was authorized by the President. I doubt it very much.

Mr. Schwarz. Was a program to overthrow the Castro
regime authorized?
Mr. McNamara. I think one would phrase it somewhat

definitely. I think a program to woaken the Castro regime

with tha hope that it would be overthrown was authorizaod.
I think that was the objoctive.

I tried to recall as best I can what the objective was
and I think that is the best exprossion of it.

Mr. Schwarz. ‘There is a memorandum which is dated
April 13, '62, it in the Taylor Book generally here or not?

Senator Morgan. No.

Mr.Schwarz. I can read the whole thing into the rncor
It is a memorandum from Maxwell D. Taylor for the record
April 13, '62. Subject: Operation MONGOOSE, and it refers

to be after it had been read into’ the record.

"On April 13, General Taylor discussed with higher
authority the MONGOOSE meeting of April 11 and 12 reporting
the feeling of Secretary Rusk and McNamara that the MONGOOSE
Program should have no target datw. Taylor pointed out the
probable personnel problems which would arise if the schedule
were completely indefinite.

“Taylor was informed that we would have to live with the
consequencos of no date, doing the best wa can to bolster
motivation. Taylor commented that wa can probably carry
out tho first phase as planned with the review of the
situation about August 1.

“Wigher authority favors a strong effort to recruit
Cubans for the U.S. Army. fle wan told that a now look is
being taken and that by lower administration standards we
can do better than in the past.”

Now, what do you understand the statement attributed to
you and Secretary Rusk that the MONGOOSE program should have
no target date to mean?

Mr. Mcllamara. Well may [ give a rather long answer to

this, Mr. Chairman, to try to cxplain what I think it meant?
I want to ao back to the ay of Pigs.
The Kennedy Administration some 99 days after 1 came is:
office was confronted with a need to decine whether to proces :
with or disban the operation that later became known as Bay

of Pign.

I and others recommended to the President we proceed
with it. Thore was no opposition from anyone in a senior

Position that the President counseled with that I am aware

of other than Senator Fulbright, and we were all wrong, it

was a clear error. This became apparant to some of us

shortly afterwards. It certainly wasn't apparent prior to
tho time’ but it became apparent shortly afterward.
Despite our feeling that it was a sorious error, there
“was also an opposing force influencing us, because during
that period from the Bay of Pigs until this date of 13
April 1962, my recollection is there wore continued offorts
by the Cuban Government to fubvert the established government
elsowhere in the hemisphere. 1 think [ am right, I may be
wrong on the date, but I think I am right there were actuall,
efforts to assassinate Betancourt, the President of Venyzuela
and at the time, for example, so we were very disturbed abou
it. The President was very disturbed about it. ;
Put I think what you see reflected in this memo of
April 14 as a feeling on Dean Rusk's mart and mine that we
should have learned something from the Bay of Pigs, we shos!
understand that it wasn't possible to, by military action
and vrobably not by others and certainly not by a fixed
date, which is the point of this momo, It was certainly
Rot possible by « fixed date to so weaken the Government

Castru as to insure its overthrow, and it would be dangers

TOP SECRET



So I think you can read in the memo in our opinion to have ~

a fixed date that is kind of objective, it is that kind of

situation that lead to the miserable failure in the Day of

Pigs. ‘This is the way I interpreted this and 1 submit as
evidence in support of that the action we took in October of
‘62 in response to what then was a very soricus problem of
the actual introduction of missiles and nuclear warheada

on the Isle of Cuba. A-limitedaction that is to say,

4 limited response, I should say, to the action.

Mr. Schwarz. ,Would you put before the witnoss the
document from McNamara Tab N, which is some more record of
the NSC standing group meating No. 2/63, April 23, 1963.

After this I am going to have just one more question,
after this memo.

You are cited, Mr. McNamara, as stating after Mr. Bundy
presented a memorandum or really before a memorandum was
discussed, you are indicated as taking the position that
before the group should discuss the substance you should
consider whether the present policy would produce a major
change, and that ‘tr. Castro's position over the shortterm
would improve if the U.S. took no additional actions.

"He made clear his belief that @limiantion of the Cant:
reqine was a requirement and that if others agreed our
present policy would not result in its downfall we should

develop a program for approval which would produce chanaes

"The program should aim at creating such a situation of
dissidents within Cuba an to allow U.S. to use force in
Support of anti-Castro forces without leading to retaliation
by the USSR or the west.” .

And I call your attention further to the proposed three
studies by the Attorney Gencral on the following page, which
include as study (a) a listing of measures which would
take following a contingancy such as death of Castro or
shooring down of the U-2.

The committee has had lots of instances of language such
as elimination of the Castro regime.

Now, (a). did you take the position reflected there?

(b), does what you say there, to the best of your
recollection, include assassinations as a tactic? If not,
why not?

Mr. McNamara. This is tho first time I can recall secin;
this memo in many years, and first let me get cloar on the
date. 1 can't believe this date is correct, April 23, '63?

Mr. Schwarz. Well it does fit with some other Rundy
documents we looked at this morning, so T am sure it is
correct.

too read it.

The reason { mentioned it, you s Item A is reference
to the shooting down of U~2. There had been a U-2 shot down
about this period. This is one of the reasons I questioned
whether the date is correct.

not the three listed on page 2 under the heading the Attorne;

any of those as suggesting or authorizing preparation of
plans for the assassination of Castro. I do interpret thom

of the U.S. to weaken the Castro Government and ultimately
see its replacement by a non-Castro regime, presumably
Democratic non-Comniunistic roqimo, I think that was the
desire of the frasident at the time and the basic objectivi

of the program.

Mr. Schwarz. One of the studies proposed, as you say,
was a list of measures we would take following contingency
such as the death of Castro. “Asaume, if you will, with me,
as is the fact demonstrated by the recrod this morning --
that in this period of time there were a number of such
studies, culminating, incidentially, in one that said it
would not improve the position of the United States. But
do you know of any other country where stidies were mado of

what would happen if a particular leader died?

studies of that kind. There were. At tha time the governments
of many parts of the world were unstable, there were frequent

“changes. I remember {n connection with the then Congo,

The Chairman. That completes Mr. Schwarz's questions.
Mr. Smothers, do you have any questions?
Mr. Smothers. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
First, Mr. McNamara, do you recall a General by the
of Mr. Richard Goodwin?
Mr. McNamara. Yos, I do.
Mr, Smothers. In what capacity did you know him?
Mr. McNamara. Woll, in the carly period of the Kennedy

Administration he was assigned to the White flouss., I wos

going tu say to the Office of the Assistant for National

Security Affairs. I am not exactly certain of that. wut in
any event he was assigned to the White House. Then followin)
that assignment he was assigned to the State Department and
in both capacities my associates and I expect I had contact
with him.

Mr. Smothers. Was your contact with him oxtensive
enough to form an opinion regarding hia reputation in the
government at that time?

hr. Me awra. Well, 1 have been lead to respond to
one question on reputation, gentlemen, 1 am not going to
respond to any more.

Mr. Smothers. We will come back to that, Mr. Secretar

bo you recall a Cuban Task Forcé Chaired at one tine

Paul Nitze?

TOP SECRET



Mr. McNamara. No sir, I don't. I am not suggesting
he didn't chair one but I don't recall it.

Mr. Smothers. Do you recall an investigative effort
out of the White House after the Bay of Pigs?

Mr. McNamara. Well, I recall after the Bay of Pigs

because with hindsight so many of us {n senior positions

recognized it asa serious error, that President Kennedy

askod General Taylor, who was rotired out of the military

service at tho time, to come out of retirement and join with

the then Attorney General and perhaps others -- I am not
clear as to’whether there were others or not -- to consider
what mintakes had been made and how we-could prevent making
similar mistakes in the future.

That group carried out the study after which my
recollection is that a special group to consider counter-
insurgency was set up, and that was directed by General
Taylor, I believe, and carried on out of the White House.

Mr. Smothers. May we go, please, to Tab P of the
Mctamara Book, and this would be Exhibit --

Mr. Di Genova, Séven.

Mr. Smothers, let's enter it as Exhibit 7.

Mr. Smothers, Appearing at Tab P ip an interview with
Mr. Richard Goodwin, concluded by members of this staff on
May 27, 1978, and I ask, please, to go to Paragraph number
1 headed Assassination.

Roading from number paragraph one, McNamara Exhibit 7,
wa find thase words: "In general, Goodwin had not heard
much spacific talk of assassination although it would not
have surprised him if it had gono on. He mentioned one
specific instance in which he heard talk of assassinating
Castro. After the Bay of Piqs and the Task Force was
established, first chaired by Paul Nitze, then by Goodwin
in his capacity as White House Staff Officer. At the meat
of that Taks Force." Is this document, before the witness?

Mr. McNamara. Yea, Lt ia.

bring to your mind any new recollections of any discussions
of assassination regarding Castro?

Mr. McNamara. No, it does not. I didn't see this
document until perhaps two or three hours ago when your
Counsel showed it to me.

I don't quite understand, since I mot twice with the
committee staff, it wasn't shown to me until today. If have
no recollaction of it, it is 14 years ago, and it sounds
extramoly unlikely to me. T know one thing. I didn't normally
attend that group. I am not saying I didn't attend, if
Goodwin said t did that day, I don't know what day he is
talking about. lle doesn't show any date.

Mr. Smothers. We don't either at this point.

Mr. McNamara. It just sounds so loose. I am not
prepared to accept it as a reliable representation of what

went on at the time.

Mr. Smothers. Well, wa know that Mr. Goodwin was not
a member of Special Group Augmented. We further know he
was not at the August iuth meeting. diam wuccy. Ne furtl..:
know that his recollection as the question was raised did not
i come from the August 10th meeting.
Without regard to how clear that memory is, this app.
| to be another incident of at least the memory of a discussion
; about getting rid of Castro, and in this instance appears to
be attributed to you.
Mr. McNamara. Well --
Mr. Smothers. I am just talking here now about a meatin;
which he chaired and which you apparently came in and left.
Tt am asking merely is ‘there any present recollection in your
mind of such a session?

Mr. McNamara. I have no recollection and I am not éven
clear what year you think the meeting was held. |
Mr. Smothers. Might we leave that?

Mr. McNamara. May I ask a few questions? This memo
on was not brought to my attention before 1 came here today
and I hadn't thought about it.

First, when do you think the meeting occurred?

Me. Smothers. Mr. Goodwin will be back before this
committee, Mr. Secretary, and perhaps we will have a cleare:
picture at that time,

Mr. McNamara. Secondly, as to getting rid of Castro, !

think there is no question bit if that is what you are asking
| me about -- let me make a statement if 1 may, sir.

As to getting rid of Castro, if I am asked about that,
it is clear enough that we were anxious to get rid of the

i Castro government. No question in my mind about that.

Now, as to executive action. Mr. Delin of the
Rockefeller Commission asked me sometime this spring whether [
was familiar with the term Executive Action. To the best of
my recollection I am not familiar with the term. I didn't know
then and I don't know now what it moant, although I am told --
I guess I was told by Belin and perhapa alno by members of
your staff that Executive Action had something to do with
assassination capabilities that wore begun or established in
the 1950's and carried over into the 1960's. 1 know no more
about it than what I have been told by either Belin or member:
of your staff and I have absolutely no recollection of this
meeting.

Mr. Smothers. Mr. Secretary, your answer satisfies me
at this point and I would Tike to move on to another matter.

Mr. Schwarz. Could 1 state for the record why we didn:
show you that until today? "

Mr. McNamara. Surely.

Mr. Schwarz. I told you when we did firat meet that 1:

-addition to the Harvey matter there was another purgon who

we thought would say you had raised the subject. I also

told you I didn't want to tell you about that until we had
an opportunity to put the person under oath.
Mr. McNamara, Suroly,

Mr. Schwarz. As we then had to put Mr. Harvey under

‘| oath. WE had thought we would have an opportunity to put Mr.
i

Goodwin under oath on this matter but he is coming back on Cuba
and, therefore, I decided to show it to you even though we
hadn't reached that point

Mr. McNamara. I am grateful to you for showing me it

1 wish I had been able to think about it earlier.

Mr. Smothers. Can I take you back to the period when
Mr, Roswell Gilpatric served as your deputy in the Depart-
ment of Defense?

Mr. McNamara. Sure.

Mr. Smothers. Could you give the committee some infor-
mation or some feeling for the relationship between you and
Mr. Gilpatric?

Mr. McNamara. Yes, yos.

Mr. Smothers. Was it a close working relationship?

Mr. McNamara. It was very close indeed, We acted
more ag partners than as Secretary and Deputy. That is why
safd earlier that although Mr. Gilpatric was a member of th:
$4/12 organization and Special Group and presumably of the“
GOOSE committee, whatever it was called, T don't believe

that anything important was authorized or approved or

Mr. Smothers. Did he report to you regularly on the
MONGOOSE sessions -~ did he keep you up to date?

Mr. McNamara. I don't want to speak specifically about

| MONGOOSE because I don't recall MONGOOSF, but he reported to
ma ragularly about everything he was doing.

Mr. Smothers. Was he fairly meticulous about the di.
charge of the responsibility?

“Mr. Mctlamara, If he were active in MONOOOSE I have no
reason to believe he didn't report to me.

Mr. Smothers. And, of course, he was particularly
meticulous in fulfilling his function and keeping you up to
date?

Mr. McNamara. Yes, sir.

Mr. Smothers. low many years have you known Mr. Gilpatri-!

Mr. McNamara. 15, 14.

Mr. Smothers. To the best of your knowledge, what
of memory did Mr. Gilpatric have?

Mr. Mctamara. Again you will have to determine that

Mr. Smothers. You talked to him about things that hav:
appeared or happened sometime ayo, including the Lansdale

situation you have related to us, Is his memory good,

TOP SECRET



Mr. McNamara. I don't want to characterize his memory.
Mr. Smothers. Mr. Secretary, is {t you have no

impression of it?

Mr. McNamara. I don't wish to give a personal opinion

‘ of other people's capacity. Mr. Gilpatric I know from

the record has testified before you. You are qualified to

| appraise his memory.

Mr. Smothers, Without being disrespectful, I think
this is a porfectly legitimate question and I fo desire a
response to it,

Mr. McNamara. I can tell you that he is in a position
where his performance depends on his memory and his per~
formance {s highly regarded by his peers.

Mr. Smothers. Well, again you have been in a position
to assess his powers or recollection, and this isa
question of some importance to this committee and
if you can make that assessment I would like to have it.

Mr. McNamara. Well, you are pressing me to do things
am not qualified for and I don't wish to pretend to this

committee I am in a position to appraise Ros Gilpatric’s

memory. 1 can tell you I am in a position to appraise his

1 am not trying to evade a question, but I don't think
that I should mislead this committee am to what I know and
what I don't know.

Mr. Smothers. I think. your statement that you are not
qualified to answer is fine.

You mentioned earlier that you had upon learning of
some of General Lansdale's commonts spoken with Mr. Gilpatric,
amongst others -~

Mr. McNamara. Yes, sir.

Mr. Smothers.--zegarding the job that General Lansdale

performed while at the Pentagon at the time that he was re-

» ported to have been working for you?

fir, McNamara, No, sir, I didn't. report that. I, stated
1 asked Mr. Gilpatric whom General Lansdale was working for
at that time,

hr, Smothers. When did this conversation occur, approxt-
mately?

Mr. McHamara. Let me refer to my notes a second and t
can give you the exact date. I believe it was May 30.

Yes, May 30.

Mr. Smothers, If you could, Mr, Secretary, this is
again an important detail for us -- could you recant nat <
versation?’ Do. you racall what the nature of the conversation

betwoen you and Mr, Gilpatric was?

TOP SECRET

H
:

Mr. McNamara. I will relate what I related earlier.
That on May 30 in connection with my inquir. to determine
exactly who General Lansdale was working for at the tine of

August 1962, I called Maxwell Taylor, Ros Gilpatric and

| General Lansdale himself, and during my conversation with Mr.

| Gilpatric I asked him specifically whom Lansdale was working

for in August °62 and Mr. Gilpatric stated that he was not
working for oither himself, that is Gilpatric, or me in

August '62, but rather for the committee that was dealing with

t
' the MONGOOSE operaticn.

Mr. Smothers. Did he olaborate further on General Len.
dale's duties? Did you touch on that at all?

Mr.McNamara. My notes don't indicate so and I don't re-
call that he did.

Mr. Smothers. Did you have any further discussions
of Lansdale, per se? In this conversation?

Mr. McNamara. Let me say I don't want to evade your
question. 1 am not sure this came up with Gilpatric.
1 don't think at the time. If what you arc driving at am I
aware there is a note somo place in the record that indicate:
Gilpatric and I didn’t think much of Lansdale? 1 am aware ot
that but I don't think Gilpatric told me that.

Mr.. Smothers. That is not my purpose, Mr. Secretary.
I am sorry at this moment 1 can't. share that purpose with

you.

TOP SECRET

Page 61


Mr. McNamara, I can't refresh my memory any more than
|
j, 1 have as to what Gilpatric said.

| Mr. Smothers. Let's not make it a tradeoff. My
concern is that, going back to that 30 May conversation, you
recall you said this guy Lanedale, who did he work for.
Mr. McNamara. That is right.
Mr. Smothers. And again Mr. Gilpatric said to you what,
| as best you can recall?
Mr. McNamara. I will refer to my notes again. 1
would like to be precise on this. Gilpatric said that tn

August of ‘62 Lansdale was not working for either Gilpatric

or McNamara, he was working for a committee that had somethin:

to do with MONGOOSE, or what I know called MONGOOSE. He
said I think Cuba covert action.

Mr. Smothers. Cuba covert action?

Mr. McNamara. Covert operation, something like that.

Mr. Smothers. You had also testified earlier that you
had had a conversation with several other persons i: an
effort to put together the circumstances surrounding this
August affair?

Mr. McNamara. That 18 correct.

Mr. Smothers. And you mentioned General Taylor, Mr.
hundy, and Mr. Rusk. Again recognizing the purpose is not
have you testify or reveal any confidence, I wonder if you

coule recant briefly for the committce the substance of the

TOP SECRET

discussions?

Mr. McNamara. Mr. Chairman, I don't wish to involve
others. I don't wish to be unresponsive to your committee. I
will be happy to report what my notes indicate. I don't wish
to indicate they are complete.

The Chairman. That is fine.

Mr. McNamara. Max Taylor said, one, after receiving his
| pay of Pigs report the President established a special group
‘ with Max as chairman to oversee tho government's count

insurgency programa. The special group ant up special group
MONGOOSE to oversee the Cuban counterinsurgency activitich,
infiltration of intelligence groups and low level sabotage.

Three, Lansdale was not an assistant to McNamara but war
Program Manager of the Special Croup-MONGOOSE.

Four, Max served as Chairmanof the Special Group)
Special Group MONGOOSE; and what he and I would call the
303 Committee, which was a later name for what was then
Se opeely called 54/12.

Five, Max has no recollection of ever hearing the word
assassination mentioned in connection with any of these ac-
tivities, :

Mr. Smothers. Do you have the date of this conversati

Mr. McNamara. May 30.

1 have given you previously the essence of my conversa-

tion with Lansdale also on May 30, and my conversation with

TOP SECRET

HW 50955 DocId:32423461 Page 63


Gilpatric on May 30, and I spoke to Dean Rusk on June 9, who

stated that (a) at no time did anyone recommend ass: ination

to him: (b), at no time did his representatives on the 303

"Committee -- and I think he would have included his represen~
tatives on Special Group as well -- mention to him that the
committee had considered ination.

(ce), he has no recollection c€ assassinations being
k discussed at August 10 *62 meeting and he believes he would
have recall it if there had been a serious discussion of it.

Mr. Smothers. And the date of your conversation with
Mr. Bundy?

Mr. McNamara. 1 am sorry, I don't know that IT have
notes of that. Let ma check. «

1 have talked to him soveral times. He is president
of the Ford Foundation. I ama trustee of it and wehave had
frequent conversations primarily about Ford Foundation busi-
ness, but I think interjected in that have been discussions
of this and I frankly don't have notes [ can give you.

Mr. Smothers. Mr. McNamara, in Jour conversation, your
most recent conversation with Mr. Gilpatric was when?

Mr. McNamara. 1 think I talked to him after he had
teatified before this committee, whenever that was.

vr. Smothers, You also talked to him just before his
testimony, didn't you?

Mr. McNamara. Yer, he had dinner with me and my wie

the night before he testified.
Mr. Smothers. | Didyou spend much time talking about the i
subject of this investigation?
Mr. McNamara. | Well, I am sure wo talked about it. I
| don't know how much time. I got home about 7:30 at night and
he was with us for dinner, my wife and I and him, and I took
him back to his hotel around ten. My wife was with us much of
the time and I am sure we didn't talk about it while she was
there, becausc I haven't wanted her to dwell on this subject.
And after that I am sure we did talk about it.

Mr. Smothers. Did you show him the 1967 McCone memoran-

but, wait a minute -- I was going to say I don't think I

had papers with me that night.Let me think.

Let me refresh my memory now of dates.

1 didn't receive the '67 McCone memorandum until -- it
was mailed on June 25. When did Mr. Gilpatric testify? What
was the date?

Hr. Smothers, July 8. So you would have been with his
on the evening of July 7?

Mr. Mctamara. All right, [ probably did show it to
him because the memo was in my possession at the time and i
think 1 took this folder home with me that night and I

probably did show it to hin.

Mr. McNamara. If I showed it to him I must have.

Mr. Smothers. Do you have any present recollection of

| that discussion?

Mr. McNamara. 1 am not completely clear. 1 think I
must have said to him that 1 was deeply disturbed about the
problem of my on position with the press because T have

| been following these press clippings rather closely, ad 1
{ indicated to you earlier, and there has been a series of
misstatements about my activities, including such
a one as an indication that I wrote the memor to the CIA

when the memo which you have is written by Lansdale, and McCon+

remembered me raising the quustion of elimination of Castro
whan MeCone said he didn't, and the memo indicates the memo of
my conversation, which I probably also showed Mr. Gilpatric
indicates he did not remember me raising the issue.

So, I probably showed both the memo of my conversation
with McCone and McCone's memo of April '67 to Mr. Gilpatric.

Mr. Smothers. To the best of your recollection did
that memo in your discussions refresh Mr. Gilpatric's recollw
tion regarding the events of Auquat 10th?

Mr. McNamara. Frankly 1 don't want to comment, wish te
comment whether it did or didn't. 7 don't remember whether

it did.

Mr. Smothers. To be sure I understand your answer,
are you saying you do not remember or do you not wish to

Mr. McNamara. The stenographer can read what I said.
I think I said I don't remember. In any case, that i# what
I wish to say, I don't remember.

Mr. Smothers. You do not remember Mr. Gilpatric's
response or recollection? :

Mr. McNamara. No. Your question was did my showing him
these papers refreah his memory, and frankly I don't know
whether it refreshed his memory or not.

‘wre Smother. What, if anything, did he say after you
had shown him these papers?

Mr. McNamara. Well, you are asking me details that
I just can't remember. 1 am not trying to hold anything back

I should do as far the press is concerned. This ia my

concern.

I hava told you that press 111 over the world has me
responsible for consideration if not authorizing assassination
of Castro and this is a completely untenable position for me,
I cannot continue effectively in my present position as long

8 thin impression lasts.

So, 1 have been talking to Roa and to others about what
to do. Thin in not the responsibility of the committee, you
didn’t cauac ‘it, but it ds a serious problem for me and I am

‘the Chairman, We understand,

Mr. McNamara. It is that which I was talking to Ros’
about. In the course of it J showed him the McCone papers, [

said, McCone said something quite different,and I don't
remember the conversation in detail but I am sure that was the

Mr. Smothers, I havo‘no further questions.
Senator Schwoiker. I had asked earlier, I should say
I asked, Mr. Secretary, and several Senators had asked your
understanding about if assassination were feasible, if the
President did or didn't know about it. I got one impression
from your answer. I have here your interview, I guess, of
two days ago, July 9, by Mr. Joseph E. diGenova of the commit:
staff, and 1 would like to read just a paragraph from this

| it was done without our knowledge. I don't believe that these
things could have been going on without those at the top
knowing it. 1 might not have known about it but not others
at the top."
Ie that an accurate quote for what you told the
committoo staff a couple days ago?
Mr. Mctamara. I don't think the last sentence carrios
the connotation I would have wished to imply. 1 think what

1 said, T will repeat now, because it dows make me uneasy, it

in going to make you uneasy.

Senator Schweiker. Uneasy can quite reconcile with

what you told us about half an hour ago.

”

Mr. Mctamara. What I have said here and what I said
a half hour ago is completely consistent. ;

Senator Schweiker. I think you said a little while ago ~~
we can check the record to see -- you couldn't conceive someth:1
like this could go on in terms of the CTA, In terms of the Ur
aident being an any way involved, and that only covert action

an J recall, you said something to the effect that you under

stood the covert action probably did go all the way to the te:
you are sure (f assasainations occurred they did not a0
al] the way to the top. tam fairly certain, you can check

the record, you said that.

TOP SECRET

HW 50955 Docld:32423461 Page 90


This is, as I aco it, quite a little different approach

Mc. McNamara. Let me both refer to what I said half
an hour ago and if you don't think I am referring to st
correctly check the record, then also Int me refer to this.

A half hour ago I don't believe we were talking about the
president. What I was discussing was the control by senior of-
{icdals of the Administration of the CIA and I stated that

' 1 Believed that there were no major actions undertaken by

CIA that were not properly authorized by senior officials.

Now, 1 did not mean to imply by that every major

action taken by CIA was authorived by the Prasident, 1 thins

I very carefully used the term nenior officials, and T mean’
particularly the members of tho 54/12 committua, » vb tnrow *
them'T meant myself and Secretary Rusk.

1 did ‘not mean to imply the President himself parti-
cipated in a review of or authorization of major actions
of CIA.

Now, I state then that, having said that, I was faced
with a dilewna of the kind you are when you tell me that
asgannination attempts have been carried out by CIA, and 1
aaid: 1 have no daowledge of it besauae f belteved rhat T

what thia implies but I don't wish to say today that I might
not have known of assassination attempts but others at the

don't believe it for several ressons.

In the first place, T believe that if that had
been carried on in CI and if anybody in the government had

closely associated with control of the CIA.

you recommended Lansdale. . And in late ‘61, and I can only

Lansdale to the job without asking me would I recommend him

Senator Schweiker. | Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
That is all.
The Chairman, I think since this quention has arisen
we should put the full three paragraphs in the record.
Senator Schweiker. Which three?
The Chairman, | Which read as follows, These are fron
_ the notes of the interview, the earlier interview with Mr.
McNamara which took place on July 10, 1975.
It is a memorandum to Fritz Schwartz and Curtis Smothers
von the subject of Presidential approval. The notes read:
“As far as Presidential approval for assassination att
which we indicated to him had in fact been made against Castt
he said: ‘It makes me uneasy to say it. Tf all these thing

were going on, assassination, T can't belleve that the tor
officials didn't know about it. [t is unlikely that it was

without our knowledge. I don't heliove that these things cou:

not have known about it, but not others at the top.'

“He doos not remember. any requests for arms from in-

surgents. Such a request, however, would have gone through the
5412 Committee. ~'We were hysterical about Castro at the time

| of the pay of Pigs and thereafter.’ And there was pressure
from JFK and RFK to do something about Castro. ‘But I don't
believe wo contemplated assassination. Wo aid, however,
contemplate overthrow.‘

snelther Bissell nor Helms, ho said, would have circum=
vented McCone and gone to RFK or JFK to act approval for plotn.
‘thatta the least like of all explanations tf plots actually
occurred.’ Moreover, he cannot beliove that "Dick Helmr
would have kept McCone in the dark about any such plots.

No matter what you think, Dick Helms in an honorable quy.'”
well, I think that ought to go in the record.

The fact is, Mr. McNamara. that Dick Helms testified
pefore this committee he did keep McCone in the dark and we
know that the CI was heavily enqaged 19 assassination
attempts. Whether or not it was So authorized is another
eee

The tinal trony of all we know is that one such
apaaapination weapon was passed for the purpose of. assassinat
ing Castro on the very day, indeed, the very hour President
Kennedy was assassinatec in Dallas.

end nash: If there are no further questions.

Senator Baker. One brief question that I think will
Hl produce only a brief answer.

Mr. McNamara, are you acquainted with

column of 3 March 1967, alleging assassination plots against
Castro?
Mr. McNamara. No, Senator Baker, this 1s something thet
don't recall. Tt quite clearly was the article that led
mr, McCone to subsequently dictate that mamo of whatever it wan,

April of '67, but T have not been a reader of Mr. P rson's or

concurred ‘in by the Board of National Estimates or by the USIB.

2. At Seeretary Rusk's request, General Lansdale gave a brief
explanation of the four possible courses of action outlined in recent
papers. He then summarized progress to date by saying that during
Phase I, now coupleted, an intensive intelligence look has been
taken at Cuba, that we have learned a great deal, but that we do not

4. Me. Rusk emphasized the destrabiltty of attampting to
Create a split between Castro and old-Line Communists. ile pointed
out that auch a split would be bound to be beneficial to U.S.
Anteresta no matter which way the balance of power swung, In this
Eeneral connection, it was hard for him to visualize a valid pretext
for U.S, military intervention in Cuba under any circumstances
currently foreseen, However, should reasonably viable restetance
develop to the extent for example that some provinces might oppose
the Havana Government, thon the U.S, might desire to give support
Go such provinctal officials. :

In resporing to the above, Hr. MeCone pointed out chat at
the moment the previouslyscited (rictions batween Castro and the
old-ling Communists have been resolved in Castro's aver, and no
Aeaue curcantly existe. There has additionally been at loast a
tewporary rapprochement between Fidel and Moacow, te indicated that
this of course imty be temporary, Me sald that there has been some
succeas in recruiting Cuban officials abroad to work fur the U.S.,
and that there have beon some defections,

3. The discussion then turned to the objectives of the
MONGOOSE program, Mr, McNamara questioned whether we cannot separate
the bullding up of-agent assets within Cuba from actions that would
hurt the U.S. In the eyes of world uplaién, This led to the suge
gestion by General Taylor that we should consider changing the
over-all objective from one of overthrowing the Castro rugime to one
of causing tts visible fallure.

In this context Mr. McCone then presented an alternate
plan (called hereafter the “CIA vartant") to the stepped-up Course B
described by General Lansdale, which he vaid had been prepared as a
result of the conclusion that stepped-up I would not in fact result
in the overthrow of Castro, Me emphastzed that the stepped-up plan
should not be undertaken unless the U.S. ts prepared to accept
ateributability for the necessary actions, including the eventual
wae of U.S, military force. Hr. McCone sald that a stepped-up B will
Fisk favitios an uprising, which might result tn a Mungary-type blood
bath £f unsupported. Kot only would the U.S, be blawd, but there
would alse Wh auiue level in che press and eventually a situation
vould be created which would coqutre futervent fon,

On the other hand, the CIA variant now proposed would, bn
Nr. MeCone's view, aveld’ all of these dangues because iC would tot
Juvite an uprining. Ayala he repeated his view that the US. might,
however, face a stronger Cuba tn the future.

YW 50955 Docld:32423461 Page 101


6. The principal monbers of the Special Group felt, after
some discussion, that the CLA variant should be davaloped further
for consideration at next Thursday's mooting of the Special Croup.
Mr. McCone was agked to stress economic sabotage, and to emphasize
measures to foment a Castroroldiina Coumunist split. It was
emphasized that any aciions under this yiun must be a0 designed us
to avoid major attribution to the U.S.

7, General Lemnitzer.told the Croup that the Navy doos not
wah Guantanamo used as 4 bave for operational activities, as
suggested by CLA. Me sald that the other Chiefs have net yot given
an opinion on th(s but he thought that they would agree with the
Navy, as ho himself doca, The view ts that this base is tov important
to the U.S, and too vulnerable to Cuban prossure to take the chance
of provoking Cuban reaction, Tho State representatives agroed with
this view.

8. He. Bundy suggested that, a hard look be taken at the
poss{billty of support to aulected Cuban extles on a wtrictly
“dlecugaged" Laele; in other words, should thoy by given covert
Hinanctal and matertal aupport, with the fdva of seeing what they
could generate on their own,

9. He, Rusk sungested that continued pressure should be
placed on Castro by keuping diiterest in the prisoner tssue alive.

10, Action to be taken:

CIA to prepare a new version of its variant plan, in
accordance with the above-sunmarized discussion. This should be
ready by Wesnesday, August 15th.

In response to the above, Mr. McCone pointed out that at

old-line Communists have been resolved tn Castro's favor, and no
fesue currently extoto, There has additionally buen at lonst a
tewporary rapprochement between Fidel and Moscow, ile indicated that

3. The discunsion then turned Lo the objectives of the

the building of agent asnets within Cuba from actions that would
hurt the U.S. in the eyes of world opinion, This led to the sug-
gestion by General Taylor that we should consider changing the
over-all objective from one of overthrowing the Castro regime to one
of causing its visible failure,

In this context Hr. McCone then presented an alternate
plan (called hereafter the “CIA variant") to the stepped-up Course B
described by General Lansdale, which he unid had been prepared as a
result of the conclusion that stepped-up Bb would not tn fact result
in overthrow of Castro. He emphasized that the stepped-up plan
should not be undertaken unless the U.S. ts prepared to accept
altributability fur the necessary actions, including the eventual
use of U.S. wilitary force. Hr. McCone said that a steppedeup B vil

bath 4f unsupported. Kot only would the U.S, be blawed, but there
would also be w hi; noise level in the press and eventually & situation

On Che other hand, the CIA varlant now proposed would, tn
Hr. MeCune's view, avoid all of these dangers beetuse it would ne

huwever, Gace a stronger Cuba in the future



6. The principal members of the Special Group felt, after

Hr. McCone was asked to stress economic sabotage, and to emphaaize
measures to foment a Castro-oldlina Communist split. Te was
vaphastzed that any acttons under this yian must be so designed os
to avoid major attribution to the U.S.

2. General Lemnitzer'told the Group that the Navy doos not

SECK

TO: The Director

FROM: John A. McCone

1, No memorandum can be located covering tho August 10, 1962
meeting; however, it ia highly probable that one exists,
: 2. Meetings of August 8 or 9, 1962, in the JCS Operations Room
(Pentagon) and August 10, 1962, in Secretary Rusk's Conference Room
were for the purpose of considering staff proposals for Phase lof opera=
tion MONGOOSE. This operation was under the direction of General
Lansdale, with Wm. Harvey handling CLA participation (under FitzGerald),
At ona of these moetings -- probably the mecting in the JCS Room «+1
rocall a suggestion being made to liquidate top people in the Castro
regime, including Castro. I took immediate excaption to this suggestion,
stating that the subject was completely out of bounds as far as the USG
and CIA were concerned and tha idea should not be discussed nor should
itappear in any papere, as the USG could not consider much actions on
moral or ethical grounds.

3. Immediately after the meeting, I called on Sacretary McNamara
personally and re-cinphasized my ponition, in which he heartily agreed.
1 did this because operation MONGOOSE -- an inter-de>artmental affair --
was under the operational control of DOD through the JCS,
~ 4, Atno time did the suggestion receive serious consideration
by the Special Group (augmented) nor by any individual responsible for

policy.

5. Through the years the Cuban problom was discussed in terms
such as “dispose of Castro," “remove Castro," "knock off Castro," etc.,
and this meant the overthrow of the Communist Government in Cuba and
t%e replacing of it with a democratic regune, Terms such as the above
appear in many -workimy papeT», memoranda for the record, otc., and, as
stated, all refer to a change in the Cuban Government,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director (Plans)

SUBJECT 3 Operation MONGOOSE

1, Action, None. This memorandum is for your Information.

:
2, Reference is made to our conversation on 13 August 1962,

Soncerning the memorandum of that date from General Lansdale,

Attached is a copy of this memorandum, excised from which are

four words in the second line of the penultimate Paragraph on

Page 1. These four words were "including liquidation of leaders."

3. The question of assassination, particularly of Fidel Castro,
was brought up by Secretary McNamara at tho meeting of the
Special Group (Augmented) in Secretary Rusk's oificw oni Lo August,
It was the obvious consensus at that ecting, in answer toa
comment by Mr. Ed Murrow, that this is not a subject which
has been made a matter of official record. [ took careful notes on
the comments at this meeting on this point, and the Special Group
(Augmented) is not expecting any written comments or study on
this point, =

4. Upon receipt of the attached memorandum, I called
Lansdale's office and, in his absence, pointed out to Frank Hand
the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this type of comment in
writing in such a document. Ladvised Frank Mand that, as far
ae CLA was concerned, we would write no document pertaining to
this and woule participair im mo'npen meeting discussing it.
letrongly urged Hand to recommend to Lansdale that he excise
the phrase in question from all copies of this mernorandum, ins
cluding those disseminated to State, Defense, and USIA, Shortly
thereafter, Lansdale called back and left the Mivesage that
ho agreed and that he had done go,
