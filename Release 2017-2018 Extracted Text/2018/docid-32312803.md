The,case involving|LINO PEREZ GOMBz,) the initial’ S| {
details of which were set out iff the reference eletype,

suggests the possibility that some measures might be initiated 7

to uncover ofihen persons utilized by the CIS, not known to the \
FBI.

(raned Sis a professional man, an exile in the vs. CSS
from Cuba where a sentence hangs over his head because of
involvement in anti-CASTRO activities inside Cuba. Most
importantly, his wife is still in Cuba in jail, offering an
excellent hostage. situation for exploitation by*the CIS.

Perhaps though, the hostage situation could be the
avenue which the FBI could utilize in ap effort to identify t
persons being utilized by CIS, such as (PEREZ. Presently known cs}
anti-CASTRO groups with their somewhat diminished membership
could be scrutinized in an effort to identify persons in
A Npserois hostage situation. However, care would have to be

exercised in any such inquiry, possibly limiting inquiry to
ery reliable sources within the organization contacted to
avoid exposing the Bureau's interest. Wa

Another group offering an avenue of approach to
the problem is the presently arriving Cuban exiles, some of
whom are likely to be suspected CIS agents. The NYO is not
aware of the actual operation vis-a-vis interviews of incoming
refugees, although aware that there is a heavy volume of
traffic probably necessitating cursory interviews upon arrival.
It is not known whether information is solicited regarding
immediate relatives being held as political prisoners in Cuba.
