ALL FBI INFORMATION CONTAINED

TRAY. TO CUBA - 8 USC 1185 (b) HEREIN (S UNC £0
eZ Penal

Pursuant to the conversation between Mr. W. R. Wannal of
your Rureau and Mr. John H. Davitt of this Division, there follows
a listing of individuals who have allegedly traveled to Cuba
without bearing a valid passport. Information concerning their
travel has been made available to us through Federal Bureau of
Investigation investigative reports and memoranda.

Representative Francis E. Walter, Chairman of the House
Committee on Un-American Activities, recently requested this
Department to make available to his Committee information con-
cerning persons who have traveled to Cuba in apparent defiance
of the State Department's travel ban. You may recall this subject
was commented upon by the President at a recent press conference.
In considering what information can be revealed to the Committee
without compromising confidential sources or interfering with
spending or contemplated investigations, we have tentatively con-
cluded that we should not make available to the Committee at this
time the names of any persons whose travel is currintly being
investigated by the Bureau or whom we anticipate requesting you
‘to investigate. Likewise, we do not now plan to furnish the
Committee the name of any person where the only source of infor-
mation as to his travel was confidential.

However, we are considering the feasibility of furnishing
Committee names, and certain identifying data, in all cases
ere no investigation is pending or contemplated and where the
source of information as to the travel is not specifically
identified as being confidential. Information in this category
has come to the Bureau, in the main, from friends and. relatives
- of the subjects, from domestic and foreign steamship lines, and

from statements of the subjects to the Immigration and Naturali
zation Service, to the Swiss Legation in Havana, Cuba, and befor
public forums. . Where the name of a traveler is to be furnished
the Committee we will not supply the identity of any sources.
