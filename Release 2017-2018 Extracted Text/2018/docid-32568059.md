JECT:

TRAVEL TO CUBA - 8 USC 1185 (b)

ALL FBI INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

Pursuant to the conversation between Mr. W. R. Wannal of

your Bureau and Mr. John H. Davitt of this Division,

there follows

a listing of individuals who have allegedly traveled to Cuba

a valid passport. Information concerning their

travel has been made available to us through Federal Bureau of

Investigation investigative reports and memoranda.

Representative Francis L. Walter, Chairman of the House

Committee on Un-American Activities, recently requested this

Department to make available to his Committee information con-

cerning persons who have traveled to Cuba in apparent defiance

of the State Department's travel ban. You may recall this subject

was commented upon by the President at a recent press conference.

In considering what information can be revealed to the Committee

without compromising confidential sources or interfering with

pending or contemplated investigations, we have tentatively con-

cluded

that we should not make available to the Committee at this

time the names of any persons whose travel is currintly being

investigated by the Bureau or whom we anticipate requesting you

to investigate. Likewise, ve do not now plan to furnish the

the name of any person where the only source of infor

mation as to his travel was confidential.

However, we

are considering the feasibility of furnishing

tho Committee names,

and certain identifying data, in all cases

where no investigation is pending or contemplated

and where the

source of information as to the travel is not specifically

identified as being confidential.

Information in this category

has come to the Bureau,

in the main, from friends and relatives

of the subjects, from domestic and

foreign steamship lines, and

from statements

of the subjects to the Immigration and Naturali-

zation Service, to the Swiss Legation in Havana,

Cuba, and before

public forums.

Where the name of a traveler is

to be furnished

the Committee we will not supply the identity

of any sources.
