OSA- 30151, 20 September 1966

LIEMPTY/LIMITED/LILYRIC photo coverage was of

value in late 1966 in assessing the motivatation and

access agent to Stanialaus

Sergeyevich SILNIKOV

Soviet Embassy

Administrative officer in September, 1966.

AEBURBLE

Photographic coverage of the target installations by

LIEMPTY In early

1967 aided in the identification of

an unknown

Soviet intelligence officer who assisted in

the training of a double agent being handled by the

FBI.

AEGINMICK

In early 1967 during the initial phases of a double

agent case under FBI control,

the LIENPTY/LIMITED/

LICALLA photographic surveillance activities

furnished useful evidence.

The LIEUPTY project verified

the agent's contact with two. Soviet officials, enabled

their identification and established the fact of their

KGB

membership.

24 November 1967

MEMORANDUN FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

LIENPTY Photo Surveillance Project Contribution

to Soviet Operations Program

1. This rather unique operation has unquestionably

made a major contribution to the

increasingly effective

Sov Ops program of the Mexico Station:

On the positive

side its principal value lies in the identification of

the Mexican and third national contacts of the Soviets,

from which we must select and develop the "access

agents" so vital to our operations

against the Soviet

human target.

LIEMPTY also provides us with a much

cleaner picture of inner relationships

and activity

patterns within the Soriet mission itself, which in

turn

facilitates effective targetting.

The CE value of

an LIBNITY type project as a monitor of real ind

potential agent contacts of the Soviets, is of course

obvious.

It is important to note that LIEMPTY is nos,

as might be the case in

Stations of lesser overall

capability, a simple case of photography (or observation)

for the record.

Rather it is an important facet of a

concerted high priority effort to get at and recruit

individual Soviets.
