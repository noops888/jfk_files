a silent outboard motor if the surf was high.
Mr. Baron. The people involved in manning those crafts
would not necessarily be employees of the Station directly?

They might be agents, even non-paid agents?

Mr. Halley. No, they were not paid. For instance, they

am only using this as an example. Let us say we had the ABC
Shipping Company. That shipping company: was a subsidiary of
the Station, if you will,and the ABC Shipping Company ran
maybe one LCI and maybe two or three smaller boats which it
could deck load and that company might have fifty or seventy-
five employees, as an example, all Cubans, maybe some of them
was Nicaraguans or Costa Ricans as most of these vessels -- I
would have to go and look at each vessel.

Does that give you a feel for the ee of the problem?

Mr. Baron. How many such companies would have been in
existence at that time, companies operating as CIA proprietaries
or companies in cover and supplying the JMWAVE Station with
personnel or with equipment?

Mr, Halley. We are talking about all of these companies,

they probably & I distinguish between

. tl
companies that were set up simply to provide cover as opposed
to companies that were proprietaries. You know, these terms

mean different things to me. The nature of the Agency's

involvement in each is different. I am having a little
trouble --

Mr. Baron. Could you explain what different categories of
companies you were receiving help from at that point, and about
how many of each there might have been?

Mr. Halley. I do not think I could.do that. We are

companies that we used during that

| period of time. Some of them might simply have been a company

set up and registered and run out of some attorney's
office. It simply provided back stopping for the ownership of
the small boat. ,

Everything has to be owned by somebody, it has to have a
Coast Guard registration, you know, ae like that. Even if
I had access to the files to answer your! question, it would
take me weeks to pull all that together Lo give you an answer.
I don't think there is an overview statement.

Mr. Baron. Would it be fair to say, that you had coopera-

tion on a grand scale from all kinds of people in private

| enterprise.in the Miami area, or in Southern Florida?

My. Halley. I think it would be fair to say that we had
extensive cooperation — I do not like your word "grand" -- that
we had extensive cooperation from the civilian sector in

Florida, in the state of Florida, to facilitate the conduct of

this clandestine mission.

Mr. Baron. Did you also have extensive cooperation from

Mr. Baron. Back to the structure of the relationships
between yourself as Chief of Station at JMWAVE and any operatives
or employees who worked underneath you at that Station, would
it be fair to say that any activities run out of the Station

branches. Each branch was organized alo g functional lines.

Let me give you an example. ‘There was a Foreign Intelligence

| So they had agents in Cuba that wore reporting foreign
: intelligence to them so they had collection assets that were

| work at a downstream point when FitzGerald came in with a
ouple of groups -- in other words, they had contact with
irtime. I had no contact with the artime group as a general

have contact with. So they were working! with these kinds of

The Task Force also specialized in much more economic

activity than I did. That is a question of looking at such

Mr. Baron. In terms of paramilitary operations, if an

assassination operation had been run by Task Force W, would
you have assumed as Chief of Station in Miami you would have
been aware of such an operation?

Mr. Halley. No, I do not assume that.

Mr. Baron. Would it not have been sound managerial
practice to let you know that there was an operation that might
have been run through Florida into Cuba?

Mr. Halley. No.

You know, the Agency is a highly compartmented mechanism.

are asking me was I aware of all these Plena you know, with

Mr. Halley. No, I did not.

Mr. Baron. How did you gather your impression that that

of whatever my question was at the time, |because these cases

keep coming up. You know, there must have been some inquiry
at the time that necessitated my looking at the folder or
discussing it with my staff and so on.

Mr. Baron. As far as you knew, what was the objective of
the contact with Artime?

Mr. Halley. You mean the CIA contact with Artime?

Mr. Baron. Yes,

Mr. Halley. As a concept, the Artime thing was looked at
as another track, an approach to the overall Cuban problem to
see if they could sort of do it on their own. If they could
simply be given, you know, X number of dollars, some equipment,

some guidance, and give them an opportunity to find a Cuban

solution to what was a Cuban problem. That was also, you know,

And once it was set

up, and I did what I was supposed to do, which was to train

of it and got an appraisal of it as to what they thought had

occurred.
Mr. Baron. Had you heard at any point that Artime was

Castro?

Mr. Halley. No, not for the specific purpose of assassina-
ting Castro.

purpose including the intelligence gathering?

could not expect that it would, given the thousands of these
things that come across my dssk.

recollection from you, then I will go back over these two,

Mr. Halley. During my period, the weapons were issued

essentially as self-protection for the people who were living

in the bush. Secondly, to be used in a military operation at

such time as we got the whole package together. Thirdly, they

were to be used for self-protection if they conducted raids,

Mr. Baron. What was that program?

Mr. Halley. That was a program involving a Cuban emigre

group that was used as an operational support mechanism to
support the Miami Station.

Mr. Baron. What kind of support aia they provide?

Mr. Halley. They were interviewers of refugees who came
out of Cuba. They provided translator personnel to translate
the Spanish language publications that were of interast to us.
They provided information on the ener activitias
that were going on in the Cuban exile community.

Mr. Baron. Did they provide support for paramilitary
operations against Cuba?

Mr. Halley. They might have identified people whom they

theught we should interview or look to or see if they would

| fit into other paramilitary programs. In other words, they

had the contacts in the Cuban community. Say we had a require-
ment for a diesel engineer. We would say to the AGP organiza-
tion, we would say we are looking for a Cuban who is a diesel
engineer who has a first engine's license, and they would go
through all of their contacts until they would come up with

not used as paramilitary operatives, at jeast insofar as they
