Mr. Muldoon contacted Agency employee

on 22 May 1974.

Mr. Muldoon told Mr. McTighe

that he was nominal Vice President of a Washington-based

firm called "Security Consultants

International."

Mr. McTighe with a report containing the essential data he

che essential data sented

met on 17 and 20 May 1974 in Washington, D.C.

According

to Mr. Muldoon, WER BELL had hopes of establishing gaming

casinos, hotel and other tourist facilities in Abaco catering

to the U. S. tourist crowd. As a consequence of some run-in

with Prime Minister Pindling of the Bahamas, however, WER BELL

is apparently persona non grata in the Bahamas; hence his

ambitions appeared to be contingent on Abacan independence.

Mr. Muldoon reported that at least on two occasions WER BELL

made a concerted effort to involve persons formerly affiliated

support of

its independence.

On several occasions, WER BELL introduced

Mr. Muldoon and Mr°3[

as active Agency officials, implying

that either the Agency or the United States Government

supported

the aims of the FOA.

WER bell also proposed to Messrs. Muldoon

and

in separate conversations that they conduct a study,

involving a visit to Abaco, to determine the feasibility of

Abaco's independence in political

and economic terms.

The

study was to include interviews with citizens of Abaco prior

to an alleged "plebiscite" on independence to take place in

Abaco on 28 June 19743 In default of the collaboration of

either Muldoon or|

Mackem, a former Agency

According to WER BELL's file, Mackem later in 1974 contacted

the Agency in an attempt to get an official policy on the

activities of the FOA.

Mackem was informed that the case

comes under FBl jurisdiction, that this Agency has no official

involvement, and

Ta that action ocha

all information we had on the matter hac

been made available to the FBI. He was advised at that time

to report his contacts and any information he had to the FBI.

1. Un 24 March 19/5, Mr.

assigned to

SE/PCH, reported that during the week of 9. March 1975, he

talked with Mr. Wesley Dyckman.

Mr. Dyckman is a former Agency

employee employed by the Drug Enforcement Agency. According

to Dyckman, former Agency employee Walter Mackem was employed

in the Washington area as a private investigator.

He is also

involved with

a paramilitary activity funded by some unnamed

British source,

is supposedly involved in the paramilitary training of forces

who would participate in this adventure.

According to Dyckman,

the paramilitary training supposedly was to take place in

Georgia, where

WER BELL is based.

8. On 31 August 1974, Mr.

met with Mr. K. Michael

Absher, who at that time was AC/E/GC,

and told him that

WER BELL was leaving

for Athens on 31

Augustzto sell arms to

the Greek Government. WER BELL wanted

to be his

advisor in this venture and to go to Athens.03.

WER BELL that he would check with CIA before giving Kim an answer.

WER BELL asked

to see if the Agency was in favor of

such an arms deal or not.

Mr. Absher strongly advised against

getting involved in this dealogl

told Mr. Absher

that he understood and agreed not to get involved.

said that WER BELL would probably call him from Athens and he

would give WER BELL a final negative reply.

9. On 22 July 1974, the FBI reported that WER BELL may

be in possession of a one-line note from former CIA Director.

William Colby stemming from a chance meeting with the Director

at an OSS alumni dinner, reading something like "Good to see

you again."

This note was apparently used by WER BELL to

suggest that he and Mr. Colby were good friends. This infor-

mation was passed on to Mr. Colby on 9 August 1974.

10.

According to reporting from several Stations, WER BELL

and Arthur L. Smith (a cohort of WER BELL's) were in

several

Central American countries during August and early September

1962.

Their principal activity appeared to be contacting

officials of the governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and

El Salvador for the purpose of obtaining recognition of a

de facto Cuban Government in exile called the "United

Organization for the Liberation of Cuba."

In discussions with

Nicaraguan Government representatives,

WER BELL claimed the

proposed Cuban Government in exile had the support of 90

separate Cuban exile organizations and 186,000 Cuban exiles.

VER BELL offered a representative of the Nicaraguan Government

$100,000 to obtain

that government's recognition of the Cuban

Government in exile. The group claimed to have its headquarters

at 1025 Connecticut Avenue

uatemala, smith claimed that the group had a man in the

Jepartment of State in Washington, D.C., whom they pay $6,000

per year "to keep them advised."

11. In December 1965 WER BELL contacted

a Miami DCD

asset and told him that he and six Cuban exiles in the U.S.

had organized a group, including approximately 20 Cubans

inside Cuba, to perform a commando operation in Cuba during

early January 1966., Their primary mission was the assassination

of Fidel Castro, with the secondary mission of blowing up the

generators that

supply electricity to Havana, Cuba.

at the time, stated that he was trying to get a "green light"

from ClA to proceed with the mission, and inferred that the

mission would be called off if such approval was not obtained.

12. On 7 February 1966 the Miami office of the FBI

reported that WER BELL had been in contact with various news

agencies concerning an alleged plan to assassinate Fidel Castro,

and reportedly also had discussed the plan with Mr. Richard

Phillips, Public Affairs Officer, Department of State, Washington,

WER BELL claimed to have a

group of some 500 men infiltrated

into Cuba and said that they were ready for action to overthrow

the regime immediately following the assassination of Castro.

According to the FBI, WeR BeLL gave the impression that he is

acquainted with many

high government officials, both in the U.s.

and other countries, and implied that his assassination plan

had been approved by CIA.

13. According to a memorandum in WER BELL's file, on 7

February 1968, one Bruce Arman Baker

telephoned an employee

of this Agency and said he had been in contact with WER BELL.

Mr. Baker said that WER BELL was in the weapons manufacturing

business and delivered them by air throughout the world.

Mr. Baker said that he understood that WER BELL does this for

Mr. Baker said that he understood from WER BELL that he

would have to get a CIA security clearance to fly for WER BELL.

Baker said that he was afraid that his past smuggling record

might keep him from getting a CIA clearance.

in early 1969 when he went to Thailand representing himself

as Vice President of Sionics, Atlanta, Georgia.

He described

himself as a counterinsurgency expert,

had a variety of weapons

to display, claimed to be a retired colonel, and introduced

himself at

a local nightclub as Chief of CIA in Thailand.

WER BELL attempted

to sell arms to

15. WER BELL was also the subject of two memorandum

signed by Lawrence R. Houston. Mr. Houston, answering a

request from Joseph J. Liebling, Deputy Assistant Secretary

of Defense, on 23 February 1971, denied WER BELL's alleged

affiliation with the CIA.

On 28 October 1971, Mr. Houston

wrote Mr. David H. Henretta, Jr., of the Industrial Security

Clearance Review Division, to return notarized Interrogatories

previously sent by Mr. Henretta.
