A. Identification.

Mexico City, Mexico -- Political Action, See C, below for other

countries which may become involved.

B. Objectives.

‘To support and sustain a long-established, proved, anti-Communist ae
front organization in Mexico. To encourage the expansion of the group's i
presext efforts in provincial Mexico, and, to some extent, in other
countries. To obtain a measure of significant control over the
organization through this continued funding. To guide the group in
increasingly more efficient methods of fighting Communism and fostering
pro-western programs, such as the Alliance for Progress. To :

accomplish the following objectives in the Related Mission Directive:

C. Background.
LIHUFF (Identity A) was founded in 1953 under the auspices of a ‘i
grocp of Mexican bankers, industrialists, and merchants to spread the (
principles af free enterprise and private initiative. Since its founding,
the group has arranged a number of meetings and congresses designed
to exglore the dangers of Communism (particularly in its economic
aspezs) and hyper-nationzlism. It has also financed the publication of
pamzhlets, bulletins on economic matters, and books. The director of
this grocs (LIHUFE-2) received support from LIHUFF-l and the business
firm which LIHUFF-I headed in Mexico until 31 December 1962 when this

comgany decided to give up its franchise in Mexico.

fn Fune 1960 LIHUFF-l1 visited the ODACID Political Counselor and
requested an ODACID contact with LIHUFF~2's organization, Subsequently,
Chie ODACID Mexico, asked the COS, KUBARK Mexico, to explore the
possibifity of giving financial help to the group headed by LIHUFF-2. In
mid-August 1962 (HMMS-2530 RYBAT), Oliver G, GALBOND advised the
Mexico Station that the group had been receiving partial financial aid
from a group of PBPRIME business corporations (solicited by Mr. Heury
He®and, now deceased) znd that KUBARK Headquarters had also provided
some fimancial assistance through this channel, After the death of :

Mr, Holland, it was recommended that the funding be handled through
the Mexico Station, Specifically, this was to help pay for the publication
(Identity B). The local ODACID Chief was consulted. He replied that he
thought LIHUFF~2 was one of the few economists in Mexico fighting
Communism, The ODACID Chief also aid that everything possible
should be done to support the LIHUFF publication (HMMT=3023 RYBAT
1926, 30 August 1962). i

The LIHUFF organization has its offices in Mexico City, with
associated offices in Salvador and Guatemala, and working contacts in
the provinces of Mexico and in several capital cities of Latin America.

LIHUFF devotes its efforts to selling the free enterprise system as
an economic way of life and in defending at every turn individual liberty
or freedom. In Mexico this type of organization is rather unique, ae the
trend in Mexico is towards more government intervention.

LIHUFF maintains an excellent library of source materials on
economics and free enterprise, which is open to interested researchers.
LIHUFF publishes regularly a considerable amount of materials,
including the monthly publication (Identity B), See Enclosure 5 for
samples of LIHUFF publications.

The group is extremely active in the student field, in the provinces
as well as in the capital. It supports student publicati has organized
a national student group (Identity C); and engages in militant student
political action.

LIHUFF also prepares and sends out to provincial newspapers
editorials featuring anti-Communist themes. In the last four years
LIHUFF has collected 65 loose-leaf binders filled with editorial clips
authored in the LIHUFF office. LIHUFF also sponsors a training course
at which interested groups (of 15 to 20 persons) are indoctrinated,

LIHUFF-2, Director of LIHUFF, has shown complete dedication

to his program, The members of LIHUFF, especially the students,
have demonstrated courage and conipetence in a variety of operations.

cut-out and operational adviser to LIHUFF-2, the Director of the group.
LIHUFF-1 worked for KUBARK in Panama from 1947 until April 1949
when he returned to Mexico. He was in contact socially with members
of the Mexico Station and in November 1962 was hired for the above
work, Biographical data is being forwarded via separate dispatch, He
is contacted by Willard C, CURTIS or Michael C, CHOADEN, Training
is not required aince LIHUFF~1 has been in intelligence work from his
service with PBPRIME military intelligence during WWI. He was
engaged to work for PBPRIME military intelligence in Mexico until :
recently, He knows that he is working for KUBARK. HMMW-11040 of ae
25 October 1942 granted OA for LIHUFF-1.

LIHUFF-2 is a 46 year old Mexican lawyer. He is also a well known
economist who directs an economic research organization in Mexico and
other Latin American countries. He is met by LIHUFF-]. LIHUFF-2
probably suspects that funds may come to him from ODYOKE; however,
cover used is that the money is from private basiness groups. He was |
granted an OA on 26 October 1962 (HMMW-11089 of 9 November 1962).

2, Mechanisms,

a, The principal officers of the Identity A group are listed in
Appendix I (separate cover enclosure No, 3), Other details of the A
organization are included in C. Background above. |

b. The LIHUFF organization frequently and regularly makes
press placements in all of Mexico City's leading newspapers, Its
editorial features are also regularly accepted by provincial publications,
Radio and television placement is on an irregular basis.

(1) General promganda and political actions of LINUFF
will be influenced and guidedty the Station for its benefit,

(2) LIHUFF student operations have already been
utilized (often in coordination with other Station student assets).

_

(3) The LIHUFF editorial service for provincial news=
papers has been used by the Station.

(4) The press~placement capabilities of LIHUFF in-
capital city newspapers, which is considerable, has been used, This
will be taken advantage of by the Station for KUBARK purposes. :

(5) LIHUFF's international connections, especially his :
associated offices in Salvador and Guatemala, will be exploited, i

(6) The Station will call on LIHUFF to fill research needs.

E. Security Evaluation,

The LIHUFF organization is funded through a cut~out in such a
manner that KUBARK participation is concealed, It is not connected in
any way with any other KUBARK operation.

F. Coordination,

All coordination with other PBPRIME elements will be handled by
COS Mexico as such situations arise. For the present there are none.
In the past, ODACID Chief Mexico asked COS Mexico to assist the group
-financially, Also, the operational use of LIHUFF-1 was cleared with
PBPRIME military intelligence when it was learned that they also had an
interest in using him in clandestine operations, They are not using him
at the pre.ent time. i

G. Costs,

1, It is requested that the following estimates be approved for use
in the LIHUFF project for the period 1 May 1963 through 30 April 1964;

FY 1963 FY 1964

LIHUFF-1 Salary $1,000, $ 5,000,
Identity publication 2, 400. 12,000,
Identity student organization 1, 600, 8, 000,
Total $5,000, $25,000,

Station Mexico proposes to pay only a portion of the LINUFF operation.
It is not intended that this partial support will make LIHUFF a completely
controlled Station asset. It will make it responsive to Station guidance.
The organization receives funds from private groups but the Station does
not know the amounts or all the donors and it is unlikely that we will ~
know these exactly. The Station, however, will be alert for the future
possibility that the LINUFF may begin to operate solely on Station funds,
Should this occur, steps will be taken to place the organization under

oe complete, classic control,

Since the Director of the group is a Mexican national, he could continue
living and working in Mexico in the event of emergency anti-ODYOKE
situations; however, he probably would not outright attack his own govern=
ment. It is likely that the group locally might lose its effectiveness or
cease to function in Mexico. However, a change in the Mexican political
