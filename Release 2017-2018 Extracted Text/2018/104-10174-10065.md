Concerning the prohleus which Log tas with hia colleagues

IIHAC01-1 ran not able to offer specific exasples. In at least 3

Instances LOG spoke to I-l that the perchelocical atmospher within

the Sov Sahassy Is horrible and depressing. Led stated thet there wae

not a single perion in the Enbassy in waich one can confide; everybody

in ready to cut otherones throat just to adrance; li trere le nothing

the colleagues can pin against a person they start intriguing roping

that one might lose his terper and coumit monethine stupid which

mould be sufficient to horr the persor involred: if ones aska for

the only of keeping out of troubles, concluded ics.

With regard to the statenent that ICS was commiting errore

by exterting pressure on other people I-l stated that he reported

LoGs renewed attempt to recruit liqüel Angel: In doing so IOG abandoned

Valentin LOGINOr

Edad aproximada de 13-45 años, aunque spareita menos. Fisicamente

de complexión atletica, alto. Juega muy bien al tenis. Recientemente

quedo en segundo lugar en el campeonato del D.F. que tuvo lugar

en el Clul francia, donde practica este deporte. Cuida alchisimo

su condicion fisica y mas que nada su apariencia. En este seatido

es muy vanidoso, Muy pocos amigos saben que tiene una bija de

16-17 años. Cuando le preguntan si tjene hijos hable solo de su

hijo de il años de edad. Le da pena presentar a su mujer, que es

muy amable y buena, porque se ve de mis edad que el. No fuma, toma

muy poco, aunque cuando la ocasion requiere de tomar mucho agucente

y siempre se le ve sereno. Es muy anable en el trato.

Nunca trata

de imponer sus ideas; pero siempre pendiente de convencer por las

buenas, a sus con trie tes fundo venque no puede hacer 1o altimo,

rompe diplomaticamente los relaciones amistosas con el sujeto

En sus ideas es de la escuela estalinista: solo cuenta lo Union

Sovletiea y la altima, linea a seguir del Partido.

Eso quiere decir

que no tlene Ideas propias. Sigue ildelisinamente la "linea" porque

sabe nuy bien que es la anica forms rápida y eficaz de escalar en

su carrera. Le gusta muchisimo la vida buena, tipo occidental,

aunque antes se dejaria cortar un brazo que confesarselo asi aisno.

Es muy ambicioso y se ve que tiene problenas con sus conpañeros de

trabajo. Hable despectivamente de ellos. No le gusta nada la idea

de tener que permanecer en l'osed los dos años que vienen.

nie

que haria lo posible que al transcurrir esos años lo mandaran de

preferencia otra vez a sexico. Su ilustoa eas grande es trabajar

en sspaja, duora i los españoles. La foma de ser de los mejicanos

no lo gusta, Por eso si quiere regresar, quiere decdr que prefiero

cualquier lugar donde vivir, menos Rusia, Creo que precisarenie

porque ya tiere que partir en jullo, es por lo que ultinanente esta

cometiendo erTores, Quiere hacer lilrites a cono de lugar, presionando

a la gente de te que antes Janas bacía. El dia 3 de mayo 10 41

en cuaularios y sublondo que po no quiero trabajar para el. me

Insistio, llesando a demo

coleolo de preguntar si podiamos

abordar

mi aluano. Johe, sin siguiera preguntar por la personalidad y forma de

pensar de John. Do los 15 miautos que estuvimos juntos no hablo mis

que de eso. Cuando yo le dije que ya le tabla dicho antes que no

me gustaba esa clase de trabajo, ne contesto que él creja que lo

que me passba es que tenta miedo. La forma mis inocente de hacerme

picar! A continuacion, me invito a comer el dia & para seguir

•hablando de lo mismo En el fondo creo que todo eso revela cierta

Inocencia y muchas ganas de progresar, para llevar una vida muy

diferente a lo que llevan los clúdadanos soviéticos: Creo que

quiere dejar una grand impresion a sus jefes para no quedar trabajando

Indefinidomente en el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Mosca.

No sé hasta que sunto aus untalones pueda gutarlo: a proscesar

incluso por medio de atropellar victimas. Como persona y en condiciones

normales me parece bueno, generoso y fiel amigo. Sin embargo la

verdad es que nunca 10 llegue a conocer muy bien, en parte posiblemeate

porque casi desde el principio sentia instintivamente que querta

algó de st, muy aparte de nuestra unistad y en parte porque con todo

y la confianza que llego a tener conmigo jamas se descubrio por

completo, ni mucho menos. Es extreniadamente calteloso.

Rajuriendo: Il Impresion es qué es una buera

persona, de buenos

santiatentos, pero que una vez ecido en "ese trabajo," por razones

que desconocesos, hace

todo lo posible por destacas.

Embassy and contacted cos..

Subject apparently has known!

and had asked

to whom he could talk in the Ebassy about

a delicate matter.

Thad recommended COS, identifying bim

only as a First Secretary.

2.

Subject identitied himself as an insurance Salesman who

18 in

Mexico as a tourist and who apparently hopes to do some.

business here.

He is of Italian origin and apparently has lived

1n Texas and California.

-At the present time,

he is

Telephone number 15

Subject's story was that he bas been in contact with

Valentin LOGINOV (2-11,712): (he showed COS LOGINOV's card) and;

as a matter of fact,

has hnd no less than 12 contacts with his.

He is scheduled to have dinner with LOGINOV tonight: (20 June) at

2000 hours but he would not say where as he was afraid that COS

would contact the CIA people and survelt bim

He is also scheduled

to have dinner witb LOGINOV on 25 June.-

In the past;

they have

had dinner at such places as la Cava and the other Tecali Restaurant.

4.

Subject

refused to say very much about the nature of bis

contact with LOGINO%.

His reason for contacting COS was to get a

copy of the latest Embassy phone directory, which LOGINoV had

asked bin for.

he wanted to bring it to LOGINOV so that LOGINOv.

would do things for bin. He did not say exactly what LoGINoy

could do

for him except that LOGINOV had tavited him to visit the

Sowiet. Union.

LeGINov has also &lyon him several bottles of vodka.

He was not worried about

what LOGINOY could get out of bim because,

was just an insurance salesmon.

In other words, he

seened to be enjoying playing games wito LOsINOV and was not

particularly

ready to cooperate

with us. cos saad that he would

have to contact the "proper people" to see about the phone, book.

Subject asked COS to do that and said that he would call cos ac

1800 bours on 20 June to get

the anster

He also said that it the

"proper people" vere interested, they could contact him at the

address

phone number siven above.

when Subject calls at 1800 hourg, he will be told that

COS has gutten

in

touch

with

the

"proper

people" and that a

representative of these people will call Subject

on 23 June.

As

lor the phone book, COS will say that this is entirely out

of

his hands and that

the man who contacts Subject on 23. June w1ll

presumably deal with that.

6.

My plan at present is to have Bruce E.

FERNALD (P) call

Subject on

June

and

attempt to get as much of r debrieling as

possible without being hostile of aggressive.

i an. looking at the

long-range possibilities here because, unless there are unexpected

developments, it is probably too late to use this against LeGINOv,

However, I Subject has really been cultivated so asstduously by

LOGINOV; the chances are that LOGINOV will turn him over to his

successor.

assuning

that Subject contirues to show the promise that

he has apparently shown thus tar.

Iwant FERNALD to get as much as

he can out of Subject without either frightening Subject away from

LOGINCV or ruining the possibility of future cooperation against

LOGINOV's successor®

As for the phone hook, I have no intention

of

passing it, at least without knowing a lot more about wat is going

on•

Subject can be

told and can

pass on to LOGINOV. that this

is a

tightly controlled publication and that it will not be very easy to

come by (that is, unless he manages to steal one on his own).

Tale meet was held infleu of. the one scheduled for hey 14

which Ia2 postponed by phone. I*l nos ot the pick up place 10 minutes

before the scheduled time but I was there still earlier and

I observed

nothing suspicious in terms of stakeouts or surveillance. The meet lasted

75 mino NEXT NIET: Tednesday lay 28 at the same pick up place.

2.

As we ret: I'l stoted that he cancelled the last week meet

becaure he was seized by one of hia nervous crisle of hysteria follored

by depression (dio). He innediately added that ke prepared for re nothing

because in bis condition he was not able to do any work.

3..

In the restaurant he kept on describing what effect the nervous

crisis das on him and he added that he still felt depreseed. During: his

description he did not indulge in dramatizing the matter.

I asked him what happened to the lunch he was supposed to have

with LOGINOV and he repeated what he told me by phone on lay 8 and added

that LOGINOV was to

call hin but ald not do it. He added that if LoGINoY

had called during

the past & days the phone would de,anewered only if

to wife ras home. I told him that this fact was a reason for him to

he knew nothing ebout feinsi, except, that hie rife gave a birth to a

child during his absence and he added that if ValueD had returned be

6.

Speaking about ferel he recalled the fact that cerole Hirsa,

an Ecuadorian Girl of 22 approx. returred to kerico and she will be

takins an latesive course of Russien (ron I-l. He stated that he spoke

to KARTASUl about this girl, she was here and vorked with the Olympte

concittee ae an interpreter; arder the Olymptes she went to scuador and

now she returned bere; she came with her mother who found her an epartment

In Rio Elta where they had a worming up party on Fridey key 9; her

father te a vell to do phisician in Quito, Ecuador; she bas no permit

to rork in lexico which neans that her father will pay the expenses of

her stat heres in vlew of his nervous crisis he did not keep in touch

wIth her, but he belteres that her motter had returned to Quito by now:

LOGINOV knows her fron some of the parties Ill and hie friends were

elving during the Olympies or briefly after them.

He forgot to tell me that he was with Andrea CARANO (P-13,546)

after abe returned fron her trip to the us end Canade and she told him

that she definitely broke with CHERNISH (P-13,042) by telling him that

the had d boy friend about whom she is serious and who is a jealous types

ke (C) 16 welleone to come to her (parents) hose when be wishes, but

I asked Lui was it possible that LOGINOV, who according to bim

win driving hard to antaba achieve some succese before be leaves, night

have attenpted to rectuit Juan Tuld AlVARS, director of the lensuage

school on Tiher, during the past 2 roathe. Il stated that he doubted

that JId would even want to see LOGINOV becayse ICC in rang instances

lenored Jas requests through I-l to pase by the school, I-l went on

Val in private. I repeated that all I wanted to do was

make it clear to him that I held him in great esteem as

a person, valued his friendshin, was not interested in

assisting his

Val works mornings only. Gloria mentioned that

val is in the embassy only in the morning. This was

in response to my statement that. I had tried to call

the embassy and talk to Val to find out what had hap

assets. He does not want to be seen with us because

we would lose

our value to him. He told Gloria that

they should confine their contacts to the French

Club. This seems to confirm the suspicion that he

belleves that this-is a secure place to meet people.

It la possible that he checked with his colleagues

the economic. He seemed disgusted, and said Spruce

wasn't worth anything.

Val then sald that he wanted me to know that ha

was prepared to pay a lot of money for any information

I might obtain for him. I said I'd talk to Spruce about

it and see if he had anything to sedl so that I could

take my commission. I added that Spruce would probably

faint or tremble with terror this pleased Val greatly.

I then asked Val if the Americans had ever offered

him any money for his information. Ile averted my eyes

SUPJECT: Valentin Laguinov

DATE OF INFCRIATIONS February 1, 1969, 1200 hours.

PLACE ACQUIRED: French Club

Interest in Arerican School. Val asked me 1f I

could recall the address of the American school. He will

call me for xx 1t. He wants to have his son Dmitri par-

tielpite in some activities with the children at the

#Chool in order to learn English. Dmitri finishes

school at the Russian embassy at 1400 hours. val hopes

that maybo there are some afterschool activities such

as football for Dmitri.

COMMENT

This may be just val's Inate stucidity. Maybe he

really couldn't find the American Stbool in the tele

phone directory.

Perhaps Val already knows of some after-school activity

of which I am unaware. Mayke he already knows that someone b

child is there, someone he wants to meet. Perhaps he wants

an excuse to wander about the school, meeting people.

Perhaps Val couldn't care less abous the school. Per-

haps he 1s hoping for

an excuse

to call me, suggesting our

chiddren practice English together. Perhaps he is preparing

the ground for to go to soncone else he already has in mind

to explain that there is no convenient program of after-

school

actlvities for Dmitit. He might ask that person to

agree to hava Dmittt play with his children.

It just occured to me that for the first time in many

months Valentin, spoke Russian to me.

While I was playing

tennis he shouted to me in Russian,

"You really are playing

with your left now". And later had a head-ache,.

*YOu. look tired", When I

answered that I was and that I

He looked

raise the question of the Solet Invasion of the CSSR.

SARATOV staunchly

dofended the Soviet and Warsaw Pact occupation claiming that 1t was a

necessary move because of the increasing aggressiveness of the West

Germans and that the avowed purpose of West German truculence was to put

pressure on both the CSSR and Fast Cermany In hopes of reunifying Germany.

SARATOV did not become enotional ovor his defense, but loft little doubt

that he wholeheartedly approved of the Soviet move into the CSSR. Neither

In short, Ill felt that the evening went off snoothly and as the LIROBBINS

departed SARATOV walked them down the steps and solicitously inquired of

I/l as to whether they (SARATOV's) had entertained properly and 1f all

had boen satisfied with the SARATOV's production. Ill found this vaguely

out of keeping with SARATOV's personality and somewhat gauche. I/l noted

that the SAPITOV apertment was modern and well-kept giving every evidence

Consular Corps. Visit to Veracruz

The undersigned visited Veracruz on 9 and 10 November

together with other members of the Consular Corps on

an

official visit to that city.

Although the Cubans were

scheduled to attend and official diplomas proclaiming them

guests of the City of Veracruz were prepared, none of them

showed up, including Lino

SALAcAR Chia,

who is stationed in

Veracruz

The Czechs,

East Germans,

and Poles for a number

of reasons also failed to go on this trip.

Thus, the only

Communist representative was Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV,

with whon the undersigned had plenty of opportunity to talk.

It seems that LOGINOV, at least for public consumption,

considers the undersigned "his friend." LOGINOV was accompa-

nied by his wife.

2.

The following were the main points of interest

discussed by LOGINOV:

The Soviet appeared very anxious to get.

the undersigned's opinion on a subject to which

he

kept going back time and again during the visit:

the position

of the Richard N. NIXON aduinistration

vis-a-vis Communist China.

Specifically, what

• LOGINOV wanted to know was what the chances are

that the NIXON administration night attempt to bring

about a rapprochement between Communist China and

the United States.

LOGINOV approached this topic

fron various directions, and the undersigned had

the distinct impression that be had received i

speciiic query on

this subject.

At one point,

LOGINOV stressed the importance of Communist China

to his country,

"indicating that his government is

becoming increasingly concerned

with developments

there.

b.

Connected with the above was LOGISOV's

concern for peace in Vietnam.• For

the first time

that the undersigned can

remeber, a Soviet stated

that the United States

and his country had "a

common interest of utmost importance" in bringing

peace to Vietnam. That the Soviet interest may

be connected with their concern about Communist

•China was indicated by LOGINOV when the latter

Indicated that peace should be obtained in Vietnar

as a way to keep out the Chinese Communists.

This did not prevent LOGINOV from making the usual

noises in favor of the National Liberation Front

and the Vietcong, blasting away at South Vietnamese

militarism.

C.

While talking about the Middle

East,

LOGINOV said that the Soviet Union was

in the

Mediterranean to stay

and fully intended to give

such support to the Arab nations in that area as

to someday

"get rid of Israel."

LOGINOV specifically

stated,

"The

Jews have it coming to them, and the

day of

reckoning is coming."

curious

the undersigned was

to know whether this was prompted on

LOGINOV's part by a dislike of the Israelis of an

anti-Semitic feeling.

LOGINOV was quite blunt änd

categorically stated

that he for one

"hated' all

Jews,

and did not hide his profound anti-Semitism.

LOGINOV added that Jews are parasites who have

little nationalism other than that gencrated by the

Zionist cause.

He implied that those Jows left in

the Soviet Union are foreigners who have done little

to help the Soviet cause.

The undersigned pointed.

out that anti-Semitism has been a long Russian

tradition,

dating. back to before the Revolution,

and deplored this obvious discrimination.

He added

that this reminded him of the anti-Semitism of the

party which

not so long ago made mass murder of

Jews a matter of national policy.

d. It took LOGINOV about one day to bring. up

the Sucesos para Todos article.

The undersigned

Jokingly asked him whether this was a Soviet or

cubas sponsored Joke,

saying that runor had it that

Sucesos was financed by both the Soviets and the

Cubans.

LOGINOV denied this, saying that the staff

of Sucesos could not be put by any stretch of

imagination into the category of "Communists." He

then point-blank asked the undersigned whether he

belonged to the organization mentioned in the

article.

The undersigned laughingly answered that

if such trashy publications as Sucesos were belfeved

by

anyone "of course he belonged to that organization."

LOGINOV

laughed and made a few more noises about how

Sucesos obtained the undersigned's name.

The latter

replied that his name was probably selected at

random from stolen pages of the Embassy directory

or other such document.

'He added that if LOGINOV

had wanted

his phone number he would have been glad

to have given

it to him rather than see it appear

in Sucesos.

€ .

The discussion the undersigned had with

LOGINOV in Guadalajard about the XGB was apparently

not forgotten by the Soviet,

for the latter pulled

out of his purse a copy of the stamp commemorating

Some KGB anniversary that the undersigned had

mentioned to him.

The undersigned has no idea uf

the reasons for this gesture.

One of the topics

which seems to embarrass LOGINOV the most is

the

number of visas he signs at

the Soviet Embassy.

Whenever LOGINOV gets a little too pointed in

his

provocations;

the undersigned raises

this susject,

with LOGINOV invariably giving a little laugh and

no answer.

LOGINOV Indicated that he was. aware that

the undersigned had net with Jiri SVESTKA at the

time of the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia

and asked for his opinion of SVESTkA ad a long lunch

The undersigned

made no bones about the fact that he

He said he had found him to be "nuy

belonged to the

very small minority of his country

which had volcomed Soviet intervention.

The unde

siderable trouble with Czechoslovakla and pointed

out that this serious error had tarnished the causo

Soviet Union.

He said, for esample, that

the Soviet interventin was very unpopular in Mexico.

This seemed to draw a little blood from LOGINOV,

he abruptly interrupted the

undersigned and asked,

"Where is it popular?"

The next meeting will be arranred by telophone:

?. LOCINOY. Not hearing from LOGINOV after their telephone

conversation on 10. May, 'Subject called him on 30 or 31 May.

Subject told LOGINOV he couldn't remember who was supposed to

call whom about setting a date for the LOGINOVS visit to

Subject's home, and he just wanted to check to see that they

hadn't gotten their sienal crossed. LOGINOV said that it wasn't

that he was waiting for Subject to call, but simply that a free

date hadn't opened up yet. LOGINOV said that it didn't look as

though he was solne to be able to set to subject's home for.

the next couple of weeks, but that he be definitely wanted to

take Subject up on his invitation and would call him lust as

soon as he definitely knew he would have a free Saturday or Sunday

him there. Subfect said that DAIMA hag tried to be friendly

with him for several years and has many times inyited Subject and

his wife to his home. Subject said he has never liked DALMA,

however, and has always found a say out of the invitations.

One reason he didn't like DALMA, Subject said, was that he alway

spelled to have something good to say about Communist Hungary.

About nine months aRo, DALlA took a trip to Hungary, and whenever

Subject has seen him since then, ho has made a point of tolling

Subjoet how good conditions are in Hunsary and how happy everyone

Is there. Subject said he thought we should therefore have the

fellow's name in our files.

S0 BESABER'S PERSONAL LIFE. In late March, Subject told me

abort a woman he had met on a business trip to New York earlier

In the month. Her name is Vella SANCHSZ Belmont, Mexican eitisen,

age approximately 33. Subject happened to sit next to her on the.

flicht to New York, struck up a conversation, and ultimtely

spent a few nights with her in New York.

6. Subject told me that Vella was once married to an

American singer, but had been divorced and subsequently become

the mistross of Jultan RODRIGUSZ Adame, a former Mexican

Secretary of Agriculture (under LOPEZ Mateos) and currently the

President of the International Cotton Association. Subject said

that through RODRIGUEZ Adame, Velia had gotten to know many of

the top poople in the PRI and had becone particularly friendly with

the wife of Alfonso MARTINE? Dominzues, the new head of the

PRI. Subject said that Vella had become fairly wealthy as the

breaking up his family and his marrlage with a woman whom he

claimed to still love and who was tolerant to the point that

Subject was able to have both her and all the routine extra

that this certainly woulda't be the case with Vella, who would

probably poison him if ho even looked at another woman. After

battine this around for sume time, Subject finally said he

that czechoslovaria vould inve bacone a Communist power had

the soviet armies not occupied the country by the end of the

War.

svesTid said that there was to doubt about this, thet

the

coming of the Conmunist regime is Czechoslovakin had

been inevitable because of the historical and social bickgroad

of: he Czechs. The undersigned expressed horror at & staterezt

liko this, which did not take into consideration the fact

that such anti-Communists as Jan MASARI and Eduard BEVES

were

the fathers of the Czech scate..

SVESTKA then went on to

say-that indeed neither MASARYK n02' BENES had been Communist,

but

that neither had any deep knovledge of the inborn desires

of the Czech people.

The undersigned told him that this

was enough to make both NASARYK and BENES turn over in their

graves.

He pointed

out that there had been a violent exchange,

uccording to the Mexican press,

between the Czech and Soviet

papers over MASARYK, with the Russians

saying that SARYK

had participated in an attompt to kill Nikolai LENIN.

CHERISH

said that this was a pack of lies,

that he had reviered the

Soviet press foi that period and found nothin; about MASARYK.

This was quickly endorsed by SVESTKA.

When the undersigned

once more stated his belief that people who had known better

would take the first opportunity to overthrow Communisa,

both

CHERNYSH and SVESTKA started speaking at the same time.

The

undersigned pointed out that

the Russian people had never

krown anything other than a curb or personal freedom and very.

strong central government, but the Czechs,

the Poles, the

Hungarians,

and others had known disfazontly. Such people

thirsty for personal freedoms and direct control over

¿neir destiny.

When CHERNYSH said he doubted this, the under

signod r'eminded him

that it was Russian tanks that

had crushed

the students and workers'

revolt in Hungary in 1956.

He also

pointed to the recent quiet but radical revolution which had

taken place in Czechoslovakia, saying that, for example,

che

day after the right to strike ned been re-established practi

cally all workers struck to protest 20 years of mismanagement,

poor housing,

and lack of freedor.

to the Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas.

J1r1

The undersigned had several little discussions with

SVESTKA, Czech Consul and krown intelligence officer.

When

he casually reminded SVESTKA that Czechoslovakla was an

industrial power before World War I and that Czech products

flooded

Western Europe,

SVESTKA, sharply commented that his

country was

'St111

an industrial power.

When the undersigned

mentioned that MASARY was very popular in the United states,

SVESTKA

countered

that that was no doubt because he had lived

as an exile in the United States. SVESTKA cut short a remark

by the undersigned about the effort currently being

made to

throw light

on MASARYK's death by saying, "There is no doubt

that he committed suicide."

SVESTKA showed himself on this

occasion & rival of LOGINOY as far as provocátions are

concerned. After the undersigned answered comments on the

Negro problem and forthcoming urban terrorism and guerrilla

warfare in the United States, SVESTKA mentioned the "overt

letter' to the American Ambassador which appeared in various

local newspapers.

He hinted that the incident

in tho opon

Ambassador FREFMAN, but also indicative of the superiority

complex of the United States.

At one point, when Valentin

LOGINOV had Joined in the discussion, the undersigned retorted

that the min who had written the article was a fourth-class

writer without a dime who somehow had found the thousands of

pesos nocossary to place his editorial.

when the Czech and

the Russian Inughed, the undersigned continued that if the

Soviet. Union wanted to give money to the Nexican Communist

Party to oninge in such shenanigans to amuse the local members

of sociallet countries, it was fine with the Americans,

as

this is Just about all

it could hope to achieve.

SV ESTKA

and LOGINOV naturally denied that their countries lad anything

to do with tho Mexican Communist Party, not to sponk of the

over? lettor on the Ambassador.

The undersigned, tongue in

cheek. thon pointed out that he was glad to tell them for

their information that a Communist Party did exist in Mexico.

Perhaps the most interesting.

reaction of SVESTKA came towards

the end of the party just before

the undersigned left.

During a discussion which included SVESTKA, LOGINOV,

one'of

the soviet

military attaches (a tall colonel with white hair),

another Russian, and a youngish, short, and chubby member of

the Mexican

Foroign Ministry the undersigned expressed a

thought that the two systems of government, the capitalist and

the

sovlot,

were gradually inching closer together.

When

SVESTKA allowed himself to doubt it with a nasty little laugh

the undersigned naturally could not resist telling him to

have a look at what was going on in his country.

The reaction

of SVESTKA was both immediate and noticeable.

le sort of

straightened out, Jerked his bead back,

opened his mouth,

dropped the ashes of his cigar on the floor, and obviöusly

bit his tongue as he said nothing.

From the above and from

the fact that SVESTKA plans to drive to the next Consular

Association meeting in Guadalajara with his Soviet colleagues,

the undersigned feels that SVESTKA is not only & lackey of the

ex-NOVOTNY regime,

but very probably in the employ of the

Soviet KGB.

He seems to be inseparable from LOGINOV and has

lately mouthed

the same provocations in the same techniques,

showing himself more and more aggressive, a thing which he

was not a year ago.

Among other nasty little remarks mude by LOGINOV,

including reforences to the open letter against the Ambassador,

the

war in Viotnam, the Negro problem, the difficult finanetal

position

of the dollar, et cotera, was a reference to this

Stntion. LOGINOV at one point asked the undersigned where

he worked (not the first time he has asked this).

The under

signed told him that he worked in the Consular General's

Office:

LOGINOV then said,

"What about the fifth floor?"

The undersigned told him that the fifth floor comprised both

the Anbassador'a Office and the Political Section.

LOGINOV

went on

to say something like,

"'I know about the Ambassador,

but what about the other offices, those occupied by WOFIRM?"

Tho undersigned let that one go

by as LOGINOV had obviously

found it very funny.

He procceded to pay back the Soviets a

little Inter by counting on his fingers the number of visas

issued at the Soviet Embassy each yenr, the number of cultural

oxchanges handlod by the Embassy staff,- and "all tho work

done for trade promotion with Mexico:" - The undersigned felt

tha

the Soviets probably lssued some five visas a month,

11

thae many, had about ten cultural exchanges a year, and had

practically no trade with the Mexicans.

What, thon, he asked,

were

the 40 odd "diplomats" in the Soviet Embassy doing in

Moxico?

LOGINOV laughed,

but he laughed green and promptly

broke off this conversation.

4.

The undersigned had no opportunity to talk at any

length

with Ambassador HANUS, who was very busy it the

reception. The Ambassador, howver, greeted him warmly and

gave him

a prolonged bear hug as he left.

The undersigned

had no talk with the Cubans except a few words which he

exchanged with Sergio MARTINEZ, whom be had not met before.

1615-1630. The nest meeting will be arraneed by telephone.

2. LOGINOY. subject reported that LOGENOV called him at

his factory in Cuernavaça on Friday, 3 May. LOGINOV said he

had some visitors who would like to buy a fen things to take

back

with them to Russia and asked. 1f 1t would be convenient 1f

name Of "IGOROVA, " MIGANOVA, " Or sorething similar. LOGINOY

Introduced her as a soneroial representative, but did not

elaborate..

(D) A second Russian woman whose name subject couldn't

course). Subject and the fow Russians then left together,

at the same time, and the four Russians sat aghast in their car

and watched. LOQINOV acted extremely sorry and did his best to

console Mrs. BESABER and Subject. Mrs. BESABER recovered quickly,

however, and soon had all the adults seated in the living room.

Subject served the first round of drinks, and within a half hour

everyone was at least reasonably relaxed azain.

So LOGINOY was the only one who did not take an alcohollo

drink. He wore dark sunglasses all afternoon and explained that:

and patiently translated for the two Russian women, neither of

whom spoke Spanish or English. The conversation was generally

dull, however, and nothing even mildly controversial was

discussed. The Russians finally loft about 1700.

6. In the course of the conversation, Mrs. BASABER asked

LOGINOV when they were ever going to get together to play tennia.

(Nºs. BESABER had of course previously Invited LOGINOV to play

tennis with her sometime at the home of a retired American

gentlenan in Cuernavaca (1.0•,

who was a

Rood friend and who had an exceptionally good court.

LOGINOV

replied that he still wanted very much to play, but that it was

always a question of time for him.. "hy didn't LOGINOV come down

to Cuernavaca next Saturday morning (1l May)?" Subject interjected.

He (LOGINOV) and Mrs. BFSABER cou)d play tennis in the morning while

Subject was working, and then they could all spend the afternoon

at home relaxine. LOGINOV replied that that sounded great, but

asked what he was goine to do with his wife and child. Mrs.

BESABER answared that of course they expected him to bring Mrs.

LOGINOV and the child with him. LOGINOY said that rould be

soment, but he nas afraid that his schedulo was such that ho

?. Subject said he waited until Friday morning, 10 Mav,

to hear from LOGINOY, and when LOGINOV didn't call, he called

LOGINOV (confirmed by LIENOT). LOGINOV, according to Subject,

said he was afraid he was not roine to be able to make it, after

all, because the Mayor of Moscow was visiting Mexico and he would

be tied up with the Mayor on Saturday. Subject said he suggested

that perhaps they could make it for the following Saturday, then

LOGINOV replied that he thought he might be able to make it then,

but, again, ho couldn't say for sure just then. "But anyway, "

LOGINOV added, "we're goirn to be seeing each other more often

because weive (1.0., the Soviet Embassy) taken a house on Calle

friendly, open personality and a good sense of hunor. Politically,

he is pro-American to the point that he mgnifles our strengths

and positive qualities and tende to minimize or overlook negative

factors in our socioty. Subject knows I am with the Political

Section of the Embassy and that I have been in the Soviet Union®

We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and

Comuunism

several times, and he has always come out a strong

anti-Communist. He has one brother and two asters living in

che United States. The brother is married to an American and

lives In Virginia, where he is in the construction business.

load go there on the

J0th, because I want to attend courses in English.

This week I'll be busy."

"Ok, until the next then."

6. From this conversation, It appeared that CAZIYEY was

probably talking about subject, since:

(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North

American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had

GAZIYEV In one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted

with GAZIYÉY after class, and that GAZIYEY had once given Subject

an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although

Subject told me he had not gone):

(b) Subject had gotten marrled that month,

(c) subfect had just returned to Mexico with his bride,

(d) Subject and his wife were looking for an apartment.

(a) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800

to teach evening Spanish classes.

7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had

considered using Subject as an access agent against GAZIYEV,

but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless

there was evidence that his relatlonship with GAZIYEV was

developing into something more than occasional chats between

classes.. I did not soo much potential in approaching Subject

before this with onerdo the idea of having his doliberatoly

cultivato a frlendahly With GAZIYEY, aS I SOlE SubjoCE MaD lIving

---

## Page 206

206

such a busy, and hoctle life that I would set very little out

of him. Prior to his marriago, he was kooping such a hectic

schedule between his Institute and private classes

that he

nasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing

problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health

problems Increased after his marriage and his taking of the

Job with the American School (although he gave up most of his

private classes)•

8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's

relationg ulth the Sovlots look much more Interesting, I attempted

to find out what I could about then from Subject.. For a number

of reasons, however--including my, going to the States in June

we were not able to got together, until li July. On that date

I took Subject to a belated "bachelor's lunch" at a little

Spanish restaurant downtow. .

9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.

I as certain that 1f given the opportunity, Subject would

voluntarily tell me 1f his relationship with GAZIYEV had

devaloped any further. When I casually brought the conversation

around to GAZITEY, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV

was still studying it the Institute and that he still occasionally

chatted with him in the halls or over a cup

of coffee in one

of the near by coffee shops during the 20-minute break betweer

the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed

talking with GAZIYEY, as he was A simpatico, interosting guy,

as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that

they never talked pollules. In roply to an offhand question

about whether he had not any other sovlets through GAZIYEV, subjoct

## Page 207

207

said that he had not. My inclination wad to belleve Subject, and

I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOCINOV had been

talking about someone else over the phone or that they had

never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about subject.

10.. On 1 November 1967, I ran Into Subject and his brother

Javier In Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a

quick lunch and insisted that I Join them for a eup of coffee.

As soon as wi sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and

would like my advice, He said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation

to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet

Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience,.

he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black

list" at the U.S. Embassy If he went. He said that he had

tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to

ask my advice, but had been told I was out of town. (I was in

El Paso from 2529 October.) He stated that if he had not been

able to reach me in the next day of two, he was going to simply

walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security

department" about his predicament. What did I think he should

do?

1l. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the

MoS. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice

other than to toll him that it

was entirely his own business

whether he went to the Sovlet reception or note Besides, I

asked, what made subject think hia name would be put on a

"black list" 1f he went. Subject replied that he didn't know

how the U.S. Embassy did 1t, but "everyone knew the U.S.

the Soviet Babassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Babassy

rafused to give him any advice, at least it nould muke a record

of his visit and anyone who has ever interested nould hig

heart was in the right place.. He slaply did not want and couldn't

afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Enbassy, he said.

After all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the

States to study sometime, and they might ever vant to go to

the States to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very

serious, I became more serlous myself and told him that just so

he wouldn't worry, Ild write a send to the proper Embassy

department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had

told me ha planned to attend a Soviet Embassy reception, but

wished the U.S. Embassy to know he has doing it solely out of

curiosity and was in no way in symathy with the Soviet Union.

Subject seened greatly relleved and thanked me very much.

12-

Seizing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given Subject the

Invitation, I asked 1f Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject

replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as CAZIYY was

now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on kis

own initlative, that he had also been to GAZIYEV's apartent

twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said

that the first time he went to GAZIEY'& was shortly before he

(Subject) got married (Subject in vas married about mid-april

• 1967) and the second time was shortly after his mrriage, as he

and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS".. Subject finisned

eating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had

his brother with him, I didn't try to question his any further,

• but decided to male and have a second do at hia alone asochor

time•

13. My wife and I entertained Subject and his wife at our

horus on 27 Novender, but the evening was not

meant to and did

not afford an opportunity to discuss the Soviets any furthere

Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the

7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by

assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he

felt it was simply safer to stay away foon the Soviet Embassy

altogether.

At my suggestion, we agreed to get together for

lunch sometime in the near future.

..Ilo For various reasons, including the poor state of

Subject's health when I called him one day in January, wa did

not get together for the lunch until 7 March. This time, I

played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested

In anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet

he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.

Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisffed he answered

wy questions to the best of his ability. It seeued to me, and

still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject

had not told me on ll July what he subsequently told me on

1. November (1.0o, that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and

on one occasion had not another Soviet there. This was that

he felt sorewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting

the other soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too

hard (which I didn's on ll July), he felt more comfortable

Ignoring 1t. The roason he so readily mentioned the tro visies

and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he vas

genuinely concerned not to "get duto any trouble" with the U.s.

Embassy over attending the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to

Impress me with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and

felt obliged to completely clear the record by mentioning the

visits to GAZIYEV's home and meeting the other Soviet there.

15. Subject stated that

GAZIYEY had invited him to his

apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) wont to

Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place

about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find

only GAZIYEY and his wife in the apartment, but that a third

person was there when Subject arrived. Subject sald GAZIYEV

Introduced the third person as Valentin "something " When I

asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject Immediately reacted

and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description

of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV: GAZIYEV stated thit LOGINOV was

with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and

described JOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening

started off very casually, with LOGINOV expressing interest.

In the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.

LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most

of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to got

a cortificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject 1f

he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to

start with, otc.. Subject replied that herd be happy to, although

It didn't seem to him that LOCINOV needed much instruction 1a.

Spanish. LOCINOY simply lnughed this off, and it has agreed

LOGINGY would drop around to the Institute sometimi soon.

LOGINOY, who took the load

evening, thon began to ask Subject questions which left subject

with "no doubt" that he (LOGINOV) vas trying to fool Subject out

on hla political vious: Subject sald that he couldn't remember

most of LOGINOV's questiong, but he did recall that LOGINOV

began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if ho didn't

find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spaniah

than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory

remarks about the extent of American Influence in Mexico, Subject

said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOY's purpose became so

blatantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation

and told LOGINOV that before they went any farther, he thought

LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was

"100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely

no sympathy with Coumunism. (While this sounds awfully blunt

and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good

In my eyes, the fact of the matter 1s that Subject does tend to

be at* a bit blunt at times, and knowing his Ideological leanings,.

I would not. put it past him to have said exactly this. Subject

said that LOGINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the

conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject

coimented that he had a pretty good idea of what the soviets were

up to in Mexico. When LOGINOY asked what Subject meant, Subject

related the story he once told me about having been in Veracruz

a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually of virtually put

under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOY that "everyone knew

, the ship was

loaded with Communist propaganda."

16. After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politica

were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.

---

## Page 212

212

Subject said that LOGINOY seemed somewhat Irritated with him, but

on the viole kept his composure very woll and treatod Subject

politely for the two hours of less subjoct remained. As Subject

wag leaving, LOCINOV again said hold come by the Inatitute to

see Subject in the near future, 'but he never did. One day in

Jato 1967 subject saw LOGINOY at the gas station on the corner

of Tacubaya and Juanacatian, and LOGINOY greated Subject by

name. However; they did not converse with each other.

17° Subject said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically.

rolated part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred

to the evening again. However, a few weeks after Subject

roturned to Moxico witli his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and hia

wife over to dinner (this wuld place the second dinner in

abouc mid-May) • This time GAZIYEY and his wife were the only

others present, and the evening passed without any reference

to polities. Subject saated that he still occasionally goes

across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEV between

evening classes at the Institute, but that be has not. been.

to GAZIYEY 's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his

home. •

18. Although Subject was very aware that LoGINOV's purpose.

In meeting him was to assess his exploitability, he did not seem

to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for

IOGINOY and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I

spelled this out for Subject

and also Informed him that LOGINOV

was an exceptionally capable Soviet Intelligence officer. I

also explained that 1t was very possible GAZIYEV was using tie

Institute to spot other candidates for Interviews with Sorlot

## Page 213

213

intelligence officers, and questioned Subjoct about GAZIYEV s

activities and contacts at the Institute. luwever, Subject said

that as far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself

at the Institute and did not have any particudar frionds there

whom Subjoct knew about. Subjoct said he would keep his eyes

open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would

let me know 1f he came onto anything interesting. Subject also

offered to "play up tO* GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance

11 I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions

of appreciation.

19. The question that remains unansvered after all this 18g

of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV were talking about Subject

ove= the phone on 24 April 1967. According to Subject, the

dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while

LOGINOY did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took

place about mid-lay. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the

truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV

told GAZIYEV on 24 April he wisied to discuss with GAZIYEV

concerned how to handle Subjeet in the light of the LOGINOV

Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on

24 April, It would appear that it was firally docided that

GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife

over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase

the memory of the firat dinnere

PEIKHODKO sald that the koxican Govormont had

turned it down. Specifically SALVAT sad told the Sovlets that

the tourist exchange between the Soviet Union and lexico was

so insignificant that it did not Justify a reciprocal exchange

of touriat offices (Comment: Evidentally the Mexicans used

the reciprocity issue to deny the Soviet requeat.)

PRIKHODIO also said that Oleg NECHIPORENKO (P-7442)

would arrive in Mexico in October and that he would have a

Job in the Embassy, not in the consulate.

While PRIKHODKO was in Subject's office, Senador

ECHEVARRIA, the brother of the Secretary of Gobernacion came

in and Subject introduced them.

Finally, PRIKHODKO mentioned that YATSKOV would •

2. Subject had not seen or talked with CHAYKHOY or any

other Soviet since he and CHNYKHOV were out together on the evening

of 4 August. At that time, CHNYKHOV suggested that he and Subject

have dinner together the next time Subject was in Mexico City.

Subject agreed

and told CHMYKHOV he'd call him the next time

he was in toNn.

Due to Subject's tight schedules on his visits

to Mexico City, however, it wasn't until 28 September that he called

CHNYKHOV, When Subject called the Embassy, however, he was told

CHMYKHOV wasn't in.

He therefore asked for LOGINOV, who proved

to be in. LOGINOV immediately recognized Subject's voice and

sounded very pleased to hear from him.. He stated that he had

had a wonderful holiday in the USSR (he returned on 27 August),

but was now swamped with work. He added that he had planned to

call Subject as soon as he got things under control. Subject

thereupon said that he was actually calling for CHNYKHOV, because

he didn't think LOGINOV had returned to Mexico yet. LOGINOV replied

that CHNYKHOV wasn't in just then, but they'd both very much like

to visit Subject in Cuernavaca. Subject said that heid like. to

Christas card from LOGINOV.

"ith my agreement, Subject sent

inoxpensive gifts along with Christmas cards to LCGINOV and

COIKHOV, but they weren't delivered until the week of 15

Jaruary. Subjet explained that before Christmas, he assigned

his salesman the job of delivering a score of Christmas gifts,

i-cluding LOGINOV'S and CHYKHOVIS, around town, but shortly.

after Christmas, found that the salesman had not delivered any

o them. This discovery caused Subject to fire the salesman,

wico had been

increasingly derelict in performing his job over

the past few months and who, Subject had recently learned, had

begun taking

dope.

Subject consequently wrote "better-late-than-

Policeman Recruited by LOGINOV

1.

In reviewing LOGINOV's SPR which WEENING has just

completed, I note that LOGINOV recruited this policeman

1579 months

ago and that his first requirement was on the

BOESTROM couple,

At that time we gave LITEMPO 8 traces on

LOGINOV saying that he was a dangerous KGB officer.

LITEMPO 8 subsequently mentioned that the case was continued

and that be, himsolf, was directing it.

If you think that LITEMPO-ß will cooperate, I would

1lke to know the following about this case:

(a) Is it still active?

(b) Did the policeman pass into to LOGINOV

on the BOESTROM couple?

If so, what?

Was

(c) What type of requirements has LOGINOV

siven to the policeman?

Are any Americans

Involved?

(d)

lave any other Soviets been involved fith

this. case?

no date 0 to man do i to stunes

As a basis for discussing this case you could mention

that ve are especially concerned about LOGINOV because he

specialisos in U3 operations:

he tried to recruft a chauffor

at

the Ebaosy and irted to develop a female Foreign Service

officer (true):

You might also any he

,1o running a senattive

case into the US (false).

Thus many of his requests to the

policeman may be in

support of American operations although

thia would

not necessarily be apparent.

Therefore we would

CANG was a member of the Chinese Emb staff here, because he did not find

hie name in the diplomatio 110t. Further, he told 5 that he wan doing a

good Job, which he appreciated, but he muet be very cautious because the

Chinese are clever people and extremely suspiolous.

In reply to S'question LOG stated that"for anyone of them (sor

Emb off101al) rould neet with FANG, because that it too dangerous. S que-

ried what was dangerous about it and LOG atated that there was alwaya

a chance that they (TANG and IOG or another sor) might be seen together

and that would he very bad. & went on to tells that it would be his

Job to develop friendly relatione with TANG ot posalbly another Chinese

offiotal and slowly obtain from him the info LOG and bie embassy needed

pay him very well for that job. & commented that he had belleved that

what he was doing he did out of personal friendahip with I00 and not

for money. IOG smiled at d'otatement and added that in addition to meney

they (Sovs) enable E to travel to fov Union and have a vacation on the

Blaok $ea.

While & wae thinking whether to say something or keep quiet, Iot

told him that the next time he went to TaNg he should limit his conv

S had no intention to sily the talk about money and he told bia

that the publlshing of the artiole about dat Ohina may end la a blind alley

11 TANG does not supply at least a hail a page of advertieing. LOG did

not want that to happen and he told 's that he (LOG) would give him

IN 1,000 - 11 the printing of the article should be held because of lael

of advertising. $ brought to LOGe attention that half of page of advertising

money as a price of keeping the door open to the Chinese Emb for &. To

put some coating on the pill'& added that he would try to obtain an ade

of two from Ohinese restaurants, but he daoubted that the owners would

be Interested in advertising In a magazine which 1s far from being well

known. Juat the idea that 3 conteplated going to thinese rostaurante

pleased LOG's ear.

10.

IOG was Interested in the status of the Presidential race and

& told bim that it narrowed down to four candedates and that all the

Indicatione were in the direotion that EOHRYARRIA was to be the offioial

Before he left, Subject was invited by NECHIPURENKO (P 7442) to

celebrate the latter's birthday (which happens to be & Jusy).

Subject

tried to beg oif but NECHIPORENKO refused to taku no for an

ar.swer

and actually

came to Subject's apartment with KOSTIKOV to bria

Subject to NECHIPORENKO's apartent.

Since NECHIPORSin's wife was

away, three ziris fron the Planitsky Chorus were awalsing che tnroe

men.

Considerable drinking was done and Subject saij it was obvious

wby they had asked him since the third girl needed a partner. Hor nano

•as Nina BUCHAROVA.

Subject said that all of the girls were quite

attractim ard "available for anything."

Subject said that he under-

stood that most of the girls in the Chorus fit this category and tbat

they would simply wait until their housemother uns asleep before

going out and getting some action.

Subject and NECHIPORESKO actually have a good personal relntionship.

#7 continued

Subject Delieves that NECHIPORENKO Is very intelligent:

He speaks

the best Spanish

of any of the Soviets known to Subjeet and due

to

this facility as well as his looks, can pass for a Mexican.

subject

believes

that NLCHIPORENKO was given the task of cultivating and

attempting to re-recruite him aftor LOGINOY falled.

subject had

some inter-sting comments about LOGINOV (P-11,7.12) which seem to

Jive with etbor comments which have been made

about him.

LOGINOV

had spparently originally bees given the task of re-recruiting

Subject. When he failed, he felt rebuffed and las since been very

cool towards Subject.

Subject believes that LOGINOV either has or

thinks he

has been given bad marks by his superiors for having

fatled with Subject. -LOGINOV is probably jealous or NECHIPORENKO who

has at least managed to retain Subject's friendship.

Subject

says

that LOGINOV is not dumb and that he uses his good looks to great

advantage particularly with women.

Subject has recently had some dealings with IVANOV (P=1612) who

is furious for the following reason:

Formerly Soriots leaving Mexico

would take KIM or Sabena to Europe where they would pick up Aeroflot

the following day.

KLi and Sabena would pay overnight hotel costs.

Now, however,

Soviets are picking up Aeroflot in New York.

Because of scheduling, however,

they still must spend at least one

night in New York.

The airlines will not pay this and IVANOV wanted

Subject to cover it.

Subject refused for the very sound reason that

1t did not make sense for him to pay $20 for selling a $127 ticket

from which his profit was only $9.

IVANOV became furious and Sibject

yelded by agreeing to pay for IVA'OV's accommodations and he said he

would do it for those becoming as friendly, such as NECHIPORENKO, but

he would not do it as a general rule.

While Subject was away;

however, his wife went overboard aud got IVANOV four rooms (for two

people)...

Now Sibject is furious.

31 July Subject was visited by PRIKHODKO (P-2270) who came

in carrying a copy of Pravda or Izvestiya.

Subject quoter the old

"There is no truth in. Pravda and no

news in Izvestlys," and

PRIKHODKO got mad claiming Subject was acting very unfriendly by

making anti-Soviet propaganda.

PRIKHODKO was very serious.

probably as good and as

accurate a thumbnail sketch on PRIKHODKO that

we are. likely to get. PRIKHODKO,

who sald that he was leaving in

Septeuber, had visited Subject to find out what Subject knew about

a congress of Jewish intellectuals which is to be held in mid-September

in Bogota to discuss the Jewish problem in the Soviet Union.

ranted to know whe was going from Mexico.

Subject told PRIKHODKO that

he had not heard of the congress but would check into it.

He dic check

with someonw ai the Israeliac Enbassy ire tas for:itled to learn

that word had gotten out since at this time knowledge of the congress

is confidential.

Subject told

me that he

would tell PRIKHODKO that

had been unable to learn anything, reasoning that to tell hin about

It would get him involved

with

further requirements and would te working

against the

best caterests of the Jews. I told Subject that I

agreed corpletely.

Subject said that the Sputnik group which was due in June never

did get lexican visas

their trip hos been cancelled.

On the other

a delegation of about a dozen Soviets Is due In Augus: for a

Congress of eye, ear,

and throat specialists, and still another

Since these are official

Versaillee, 100 exclaimed that for heavene sake he did not anything like

thats he wanted thie to be entirely on private and personal barle without

political elemente lavolved, to show the 11lm at Versailles would be

stupid, 1t would just enable the Imperialiste to blast in the papera

that the Sova were getting Involved in internal politioal matters of

Mexico, In view of the coning Preaidential electione this could be blown

up into a eoandal.. Il remarked that he saw no differene in showing the

11ln in the OPlentro or In the Centro Asturiano ad LOG wanted originally.

LoG explained at lengto the difference and I-I promieed to have another

talk. with MUNOZ•

6. i

Il told that LoG that guite croently he saw in the prees some

thing written to the offoot that there are presently in the USeR 4 types

of detention ( concentration) camps and he wondered whether that was

an Indication that the freedom in the USSi wan being trimmed agein. LOG

statod that "thia was pure imperiallet propaganda". He went on to say.

that in the USSR the cafes are full of people and that one can hear them

oven oritisiring the government. He added that in his opinion there 1e

too suoh (denasiado mucho) freedon in the USSR and other Sociallet countries

Il Stalin was alive 1t could not happen that while the people in America

ore opendy protesting egainst the war in Vietnam and against imperialiam

a Sociallat country as Ozecho rizes 1ts people in favor of American and

West Gernan empiriallen. "Too much freedon in the USºR results w1za at111

more freedon in other Sociallet countrion; this 18 no longer Irgedom, 1t

1o a chameful botraial of Sooiallen, I hope that it will de realisad soon

that Stalln was right", eaid IOG.

•At thie point Ios norked in a hint to Inl that he should do

sosething for the Socialiat cause. II sounded his old tune aying that

he eaw nothing he could do and added that now when 10G opened him the

door to the Amerioan Intelligence service through Viotor RANOS (acqually

working for the Iconomist Intelilence Unit, S.A., Reforna 116 - 801 B)

he would find out rould they pay hin well and If they would he would

work for then, booaung anyway the sovs nover fave him anything. Then Loc

anked hia what the hell he was spocking about, Int stated that he vau

m Joking and LoG cormented that Int had never done anything to held

the sor effort and consequently, they were not ablo to pay min anytialas.

IOG told In] he had no Intention of keeping Il away from bie house,

but he wanted hits to know that olnce the time BROVKIS was hore certain.

things had changed, previously the Sov Sabagey waa payles the rent for

the opte of their mofflelale and now the offloiale have to pay the rent

from theis salary. Connequently, LOt livea in a mall, nodeat apt and he

does not feel that 1t 1a adequate for receiving people. In commented

that Ioct otatement made hin feel bad because he belleved that they were

friende and that formalitieo were not necessary among them. LoG counter

noted seat by saying that I-l and his wife were invited to bia apt on

Yed July 30, but he did not want Inl to be surprised to see in shat kind

of apt a Sov Dipl offloials was living. Il thanked for the invitation

and olated that 1t was impossible to him to come before 2090 hra on ved

wan willing to pay 8 in terun of thourande of Dollarn, Altor the dust

of verbage battled Ioc told & that he should try to feel out taNg was

he willing to speak about the military strogth of led Obina. I0G e

plained to s that prosently the sove

were completely in dark as to the

military strength and operational organisation of the Red Ohinese armys

they have no way of acquiring the info beoause even if they had friende

in Red Obina none of them dared to maintain contaot with Sor offiolalo

nor officials of other Socialiet countries which are known to be on the

Sov olde, Nat Ohina has many spies in Red Ohins and they are well iniced

on all aspeots of developmente in Red Obina, 1t 10 possible that TANG

woul! be willing to rake arrangementa with his government for exobange

of inlo, especially, military into botween the USSR and the kep. of Ohina

and this would be benefiolary to the USS& and the USA. LOG went on to

toll & that he sbould think in terme of using RUDIAN for getting to

needed, the expenses will taken care of by I:00, because money 1e no:

problem.

Then, LoG stated that & should arrange sorething to enable L0G

to meet RUDIAN 1n a amall, family type, olrole. 8 was cought by surprise

and told ICd that he told him that he and RUDIAN were quite often seeing

enob other. I0d stated that he knew RUDIAN well and was in may instances

w1th RUDIAN at receptione and otner formal sooial funotione, but he never

had an oportunity to be with RUDIAl in friendly and untornal circumetances.

arrangement was in the faut that RUDIAN often, sometime even twice 1a a

hia vieite in advance more. than an hour or two before he comes.

reception: 1) to determine LOGINOV's replacement, and 2) to

meet the Cubans present, if any. On the first count

was successful. Oleg Naksimovich NECHIPORENKO was formally

introduced to the crowd as LOGINOV's replacement by

sir. KAZANiSEY,

the Soviet Charge. On the

second count

was not

successful, The only Cuban present that he recognized from

mug photos was Rafael MIRABAL Fernandez, who quite obvlously

avoided any contact with

rather furtively staying on

the other side of the room at all times. In all,

talked to some nine Soviet 'Embassy officials that he could

recognize from the mug book and had somewhat extensive con-

versation with three, LOGINOV; KAZAITSEY, the Chargé; and

said that he is from Siberia, and in answer to al

friendliest people of the soviet union. SARATOV obviously

likes to brag about having been stationed previously in

Washington.

Chinese restaurant, and Rockefeller Contor Music Hall.

10. Somewhat after the despedida ceremony, SISTONE noted

the Chargé, Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV, alone and intro-

duced himself. From a distance KAZANTSEV looks extremely

young for his high position; closor up he looks a little older.

KAZANTSEV was extremely affable when he learned that SISTONS

was a new member of the Cuerpo Consular. He said he is a

member of an equivalent organization among the diplomats and

in that context knows

quite well. He snid

he was extremely privileged a couple of nights previously to

be able to shake Astrouaut ARMSTRONG's hand and talk to him. l

He thinks the space program a wonderful adventure for both our

countries, and he mentioned the current negotiations between

the American Atomic Energy Commission and its Russian equivalent

in working

out the rules for use of peaceful nuclear energy.

While affable, KAZAVTSEV does not impart any feeling of

sincerity whatsoever. He seems transparently cynical, and

reminds one of a second-rate American politician. After the

above conversation and when SISTONE was talking to a Mexican

airport official,. for some reason KAZANTSEV reapproached

MEMDRANDUN FOR: Chiof SB

* Chief, CUBA

SUBJECT

8 Relationshio Betveen AEDIEHARD and Gloria PINTO

1.

In response to & conversation between Chief, 5B, and the under-

signed, LIREALM] was questioned Indetail on 25 Septeaber concerning

the relationship which exits between AEDIZHARD and Glorla PINTO wich a

view covard possible embarrassment of ASDISHARD bafore his superioro.

--2.

LIREALM-} ANd his wife both belleve (but have no proof) that

it is

probable that Gloria PINTO is having or has had an affair wich

AEDIERARD.

Both LIREALM and his wife are close friends of the PINTO's

and know that Glorla 1a strongly attracted to AEDIEHARD who la boch

physically and Intellectually superlor to her busband. Due to Gloria's

continued friendship with AEDIEHARD at the French Club and ocher places,

LIREILY-I feels sure that Glorta's Husband, Pepe, does not yet know of

the affair.

3.

LIREALM-I characterized Pepe PINTO as: sweet, alow victed and

below average in intelligence..

He la a physictan specializing la lung dia-

orders, born in the Canary Islands. He considers hinself a Spanlard with

the Charactertatic Spanish lack of respect for women.

He atteupts

to

cigitiy control Glorla's activities while, according to Gloria, having

an many affairs himself as he can.

Gloria greatly resents Pepe's attitude

coward her.

Pepa is basically defensive and would not want anyone to know

1$ Clorla were having an affair with another man.

He would probably deny

it df anyone said so, even 1f he were aware of 1E.

He wouid take it out on

cloria, however, and would probably beat her and restrict her novements even

nore closely.

4."

In view of the above, It would certainly appear that there would be

nothing to gain, and perhaps such to lode, by any atcempt at exposing jer

supposed affair wich AbDIsHArD.

since she now appears to bo la cootact with

SHEVCHENKO, iuch better to hope for beiter developments in thia case.

It was agreed

yeare and, to the contrary; It 18 more Ilkely that he would be still more

of posalbilities a to how a pitch could be corried out.

My views and thoughtn on this subject will be based on the posdible

be said in the following paras.

As far go I know we are lacking adequately solid facts in which

Ing material which we could use to exert a desired pressure on A.

I am Inclined to belleve that we are in a position to make a

serious attempt to obtain a "pressure argument" through the use of exloting

It war essential that the person who arrived here see

A; because that rill strangthen S' position in the deal.

I mentioned the platinum deal because it would give

some common ground to the new person heing introduced

on the sone, but some other story might be ae good.

•. The new person abowing up under the platinum deal

or any other pretext would be a case officer of oure.

I feel that such a pereon should at firet sight show

that he was a Yankee, that he be versed in platinum

or what ever the pretext may be and that he should be

a Russian language speaker. I am inclined to believe

that after some business. talk and after creating an

atroopher of mutual understanding there would be no

problem for the case officer to start speaking Russian.

Il A takes this fact in good mood and the business

conversation continues in Russian, s would be in a

position to excuse himself as a person who was no longer

needed. It 1s almost impossible to anticipate what

would be As reaction to the fact that s wanted to leave.

If insisted that S stay, me will have to accept 1t.

Nevertbeless, S will be inatructed to "go to the bathraom"

for a maile and the case officer will have to use this

opportunity to drop his cover and go on with hie job.

He will have in bie pocket a reel of tape to counteract.

Ab emphatie refusal (which we must anticipate ).

I. It may be sentioned that s will not have to know

anything about the existance of the tape and as far

as the case officer la concerned S may have to be

satisfied with the explanation that the o. o. was the

paychologist who dealded that he wanted to neet A in

person. Of coursens

đo may not bear out thin cover, but

that will be at the stage of dezerapuerts when we

could not care lesa.

the things turp out right orwrong, but s will be left

only with guesses as to what transpired between the

case officer and A in Russian.

It is the fate of any offloer making the pitch to lie

be burned if the exgersice ende in anything: less than

a success. Therefore, it would be worthwhile considering

to get a suitable laguage speaker case officer from

Egs for this purpose.

6.

I am aware of the fact that dant the above discussed scheme has

a quite certain weakness in as mich as it ia built on and around an untested

asset as S 18. Neverthelesa, in terns of security and protection uf Agency/

**** Station assets the scheme is advantageous, which le selfevident.

7.

It should be assumed that s might come up with some objections

when it comes to introducing another person to A from fear that he would

deal himself out of the game and terminate his usefulnees to us. I do

not consider it difficult to put him at ease.

9. Suparvisor's corments (continued)

3. If he had luen looking for me, it could be

that ho has been asted to stop in where val failed.

That is, as an american friend, I never invited val

to my home. He never met other Americans through

me. Note.

however, that he never invited me to

home either- though he did invito us frequently to

various events which were under the auspices of the

Soviet embassy. de did not but raroly accept, One

such occasion

was the Mosco. circus.

4e If he had been looking for mo, it could be

that he wants to assure his acceptanco by our tennig

group where Gloria Finto is a possible target. Oleg

has gotten to Glorla, but I, the American who 19

somewhat and sometimes hostile to soviets,

considered a stumbling block. Perhaps he, Oleg,

try to Icach all the other members of the group in

dividually so that an invitation by Gloria to one of

our functions will meet with general acceptance.

SCENARIO OF CONTACT

I arrived about 0900 and took an instructor.

About 0950 Olegk arrived to play with and 1n-

structor on the adjoining court. He made no effort to

greet me. He had been pointed out to me by val, but

I had not been pointed out to him do my knowledge

though it is certain that Oleg and jVal muat have

discussed the "players" in thoir"game" and counted

me as possibly on the other team. That 18, 1 an sure

that val has pointed me out to oleg, but olog would

not have wanted to achnowledge this

•At 1000 my hour was up and I told my instructor

I

was throughT did not want to continue for another

hour. As I was paying my instructor I noticed that

Oleg was paying his. It is very unusual and possibly

even had form to take an instructor for less than

half-an-hour. I am suggesting that he wanted to be

free to contrive an accidental meeting with me.

I set a course

for one of the several gates

from the courts we were using. I could see

that oleg

had headed for the same gate (this could have been

perfectly natural) and at a speed which after some

thrty yards would bring him to the gate at the same

moment as I (this was not entirely natural)

Since I had an excuse to greet him, having had

pointed out in front of Pepe Pinto

the preceding

week, I did so. I saked said Good Norning and asked

1f kal were here. He lookod very pleased (1 kehought

possibly rolloved) when I took tha Indtlative and

recognized him.

Oleg said thit val had not arrived es far as

he knew. I said I lid been

training to get roady for

Val. I wanted ny rovenge for last week.

Oleg scomed

amused by this and immediately asked

ono hour. 01gg Nor 6-3, 6-1.

Oleg is

and excellent game for soneone who has played for

only two years (if this is true). He has enosmous

muscular thighs. It oscapes me what sport would

Oleg is pleasant. Speaks excellent Spanish. Has

Intelligent, but less extroverted than val.

Oleg asked if I were with the American Embassy.

I have my own business", It was then

I answered"no" if I know another "Bill" who is in

that he asked

I left at this point. Oleg stayed on to play

HEMORANDUM FOR THE. RECORD

6 September 1969

FROM

CUBA/PBELEMENT 1O

SUBJECT; Recent and Proposed Contact Betueen LIREALM-1 and ABDIÉHARD

1. : At the 5 September 1969 meetlog between LIREALM) and Aadrew E.

PELLEMENT, the folloting Information was received from and discussed with

"stationa

FRAQUERI

after

LIREALM-I, following Sention advice tehtant the the recent

Incident where AEDIEHARD

approached LIREALM-I wich an offer to pay LIREALM-I

for any Inforuacion he could obtain from the U.S. Embsesy, has avoided

contact with AEDIEHARD at the French Club, LIREALM-l's wife, an almost

dally vialtor to che Club, has been asked by LIRALM-I to note AEDIERARD'g

activities and associates and report anything Interesting to LIREALM*l.

b.

MrS. LIREALM recently told LIREALM-L that for a number of

consecutive Seturdays, ALDIEHARD had brought a young lady, whom MRs LIREALM

50108 49874

ter?

rovsation

Chinks to be German,

to the Club as his guest.

Mrs. LIREALM did not attempt

to determine the identity of the female, but reported the information to

her husband.

She has noted no other items of interest in AEDIEHARD'®

pattern of aceivities at the club.

He has not seemed to single out any

Individual as a tennis partner, nor la be frequently seen socializing wich

anyone in particular while at the Club.

7pt he tree

2.

LIREALM-I was advised that the Station had learned that MEDIEHARD

will not return to MHHARSH immediately as originally thought, but he will

probably renalu in Mexico for another five mouths. LIREALM-I was told chat

this informcion was not yet public krowledge, but the Station would like

LIREALM-] to confiro this if possible. This led to a general diacussion of

LIREALM-l's assoclation with AEDIEHARD alace the recent Incident. LIREALM-I

was instructed that lt was not the Station's wish that he avoid contact with

AEDIEHARD, bue rather that he not single out AEDIEHARD for special attention

or closely court his friendship.

It lo the writer"s optoion that a cufficient

Elme has

elapsed alace the last incident for LIREALM"I to again renew some

association with AEDIEHARD, and a particularly opportune caance to do so 1ợ

avallable:

LIREALM-I and AEDIEHARD both belong (as has previously been reported)

to a group

of teants enthusleste at the Club who take turns entertaining each

other in their homes:

To date, all the members of this group have given partles

except LIRALY!.

NES. LIREALM, following theincident and thiaking that AEDIEHARD

W09 -8000

to depart, has stated chat she did not want to have AIDIERARD in her

hose since

he represents a governuent do opposed to the principles of her govero"

ment. etc.

Based on InnIraND'e extension in Mexico and the face that the LIREALis

one their

frionds a party, LIREALM was Instructed to plan a party for the group

and to Include AEDIEHARD

and his wife in the group invited.

At the party.

LIREALM"*

should not focug

an undue amount of attention on AEDIENARD, but

should

take advancage of the opporcualty to coney their general erlendahly and let che

asiter, more or less, take des own head fros chere.

As a firas step la chio

general direction, LIRALMOl plIar to ko lo che Club over the wookand of 6-g

september as clas shea ¡EDIEHAD uoually playa conndo to de loade say hollo.

A second reason why soch LIREAM-! and bia vife plan to go co che

Club Is to see if chey

can identify the new "girl-friend" of AEDIEHARD..

LIREALM"I saya he almost alwsys carries his camera with him when he goes to

the club and frequently takes pictures of his wife and their frlendo. Under

this pretexs, he will try and take a plcture of the girl friend 1f the oppor

cunity presents Itself where fe will not come to the attention of AEDIEHARD.

LIREALM-1 1s preparing a written teport 1a sona greater datail

concerning AEDIEHARD and his relacionship with him since the Inellent.

He "

been verbally reported to C/s& and he is in accord wich the plen for the party.

LAces in the Enbassy ((now)), I went to the reception on the Red Army Day, but

since I didn't have an invitation, they didn't let me in, even chough CHERNYSH

and NECHIPORENKO triod to help us. As you see, my brother, times change, In

our days, too when you were hare, everything was simpler and I would say even

"Parisien package" approximately in February. It would be nice to have a son,

since Me are not 80ing to produce more children. But 18 1t 18 a girl, chat ioo

I am studying English and French serlously, In 2-1 years my wife and 1

want to move to Spain. I have had enough of Mexico. I have been living here

for l4 years. On the other hand, vich she knouledge of languages, one can ear

a botcer living sa Spain. You know yourself that life 18 much happier la Europo.

1. As requested in Reference, Station queried INBREED as to

why they had Inciuded Valentin Sergeyovich LOGINOV (201-0285112)

in their Itst of Soviets who had been PNG'd of expelled from

various countrles in the past five years.

2.

In INBREED's reply to our query,

they stated that in the

periodic "Das Beste" there was an extract from the Reader'g Digest

of 1 January 1972, Of a bookatitled "Moscow's Attack on Mexico" by

John Barron.

Fron this article it was learned that the KGB cfficer

LOGINOV met secrotly with Mexican students it the time of the

student demonstrations in Mexico in 1968;

In March 1971,

when

five Soviet officials were PNG"d from Mexico, it was bolleved that

Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOY was among those

ousted.

3.

Upon learning that LOGINOV served in the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City as Third Secretary/Vice Counsel from August 1965

to October 1969,

INBREED has now advised the Station that LOGINOV's

name as erroneously appeared in their list of soviets who had

been PNG°d.

for some time. Sne did not know where the contects were actually made.

Once she and LOGINOV encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the

Cine Mod theater, a Mexican Army Colonel, who was introduced to her by

LOGINOV as "Col. Sersio." In this instance LOGINOV did not excuse hinself

to have a private conversation with the Mexican. "Col. Sergio" was de-

visitors stayed at the Hotel Virrayas or in tuo other hotels near the

Soviet Embassy (she couldn't remenber nsses). She did not know whether the

Soviets had eny sort of special entangeront or contrets in these hotels.

officer, at : me point during the evening, had a private conversation with

of any of the lexicans she net on these occasions, and of course there is

no way of knowing whether such private conversations were operational

stopped their conversation.

PROGRESS REPORT

Subject

• LIBACON-I

Perlod Covered: January 30 to August 14, 1969

I. LIBACON-I was recrulted by Saruol J. KARTASUK on January

30 and.

was handled by him until March 26.

During this perlod

they held nine ops meetings.

2.

Bruce H. FERNALD took over LIBACON-t on March 26 and

bacted hem to august 14,

when he turned do!i.

¿vor to Douglas F.

MITMANSON.

During this perlod 16 ops mootisy. were held.

3.

After a fine recruitment jul KART:SUK also

accomplisi as tra

difticult task

of craverting LIBACONd's sgreement to vare 10s

KARTASUK personally Into a regular rorking arrangement.

Of the nine meetings KARTASUK held with LIBAcoN-1,

actually only six wero working meetings.

Info was obtained on

LIBACON-l's personal background as well

as his ops potentinl

LIBACON-1 was SGSWIRLED with jatisfactory results.

Further,

LIBACON- 1

was motivated to work for us and he was

mentally prepared

to accept another handler.:

During this period the condition which

LIBACON-l had placed on his agreement to work for us was respecind

(1.e.g

that he would not be asked to report on his personal friends

rich as Sienlards, his students, or Nexicans to whom he ps

620: lonally rttached).

LIBACON-I did complete for KarlAves.&

1511ne writien report on AEDIEHARD.

FERNALD

encountered no problems in getting along with ad

handling LIBiCON-l, whom he got accustomed to following instruct.ong

and to sibmitting reports in writing.

LIBACON-l's Initial attitudo was. that he had igreed ie work,

or more accurately,

to nssist

us in our work against ASKICK, but he

was

deteruined to keep hinself away foem evorybody and everything

associated with AEKICK.

Re did nut see AEDIEHARD fOr are

than

was decistvuly turning down everything ABDIEARD asked

and shen they met ace dentally in & resort, LIBICOX-1

wont yo for 29. to accept a lunchees appointment with AfDIEHARD, and

then

a day before it was to take place he postponed it indefinitely.

FERNALD succeeded in convincing LIBACONal that he sbould

maintain sociul or friendly personal contact with EDIBIRD and his

dolleagues and that he could do it without either giving in to his

or their demands, or at the other oxtreme, without sajing no to

everything they

mention ot ook for.

"LIBACON-1 followed instructions

and went to AFDIEVARD'S

why he had not called

him for ten sects.

The result was that LIBACON~1 had two luncheon

meetings with ALIEHARD

in July, and on August 8 LIBACON I and his

wife wore dinner guests of ALIENARD and his wife at their apartment.

The ABDIEHARDs agreed to come to LIBACON-l's place for a Inrewoll

dinner in September and in the meanwhile LIBACON-1 and AEDIEHARD

will meet, for & luncheon on. August 29.

FERNALD insisted from the beginning of his handling. of

LIBACON-] that the lattor prepare bio sketches on the BOHARSHers

ho know personally and on Spanlards who had Iived in the USSR.

LIBACON prepared bio sketches,

which are actually personality

assessments, on AEDIEllARD,

From the above it can be seen that LIBACON-1 has developor

• Into a person who has confidence in us, and

he accepts without

reservation that te know what we are doing.

In analyzing.LIBACON-l's written

reports it can easily

he ascribes it to the fact that he grew

To conclude: Although LIBACON 1 has his problems,

there

are restricted to the area which does not affoct his rellability,

dependability and loyalty to us and our cause.

It is folt that

LIBACON I will be still more productive and easier developed when

handled by a case officer speaking Russian;i.e., the language of

his formative years.

5. THIS ACTION ON THE PART OF LIREALM IS IN PERFECT HARMONY

WITH ACHIEVING OBJECTIVE NUMBER ONE: PROTECTING AND MAINTAINING

LIREALM'S COVER. HOPEFULLY IT WOULD SET STAGE FOR CONTINUING

CONTACT WITH AEDIEHARD ON PROFITABLE BASIS SO THAT WE CAN PROFES-

SIONALLY ASSESS THIS SOVIET WHICH FULFILLS THE SECOND OBJECTIVE.

WE EVALUATE LIREALM'S REPORTING ON HIS SOVIET CONTACTS AS ACCURATE,

LUCID, AND USEFUL. THE RECENT BAC

LIREALM IS POSITIVE STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION. HOWEVER, SHOULD

AEDIEHARD PERSIST WITH HIS GAMES PLAYING WE HAVE NOT CLOSED DOOR

IN STATION MESSAGES. THUS THIS OPTION STILL VALID.

6. APART FROM SEEKING TO OBTAIN ABOVE OBJECTIVES BY TAKING
