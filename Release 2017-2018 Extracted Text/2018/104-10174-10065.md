suBsECr : Celebration of Polish National ‘Day,

22 July 1969

1, The undersigned attended the celebration of the

Polish national day at the Polish Residence on Insurgentes
Sur on 22 July 1969. The following points were the most
significant:

a. The only Soviet the undersigned could

identify was Col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREV,.
the. Soviet Military Attache. Someone the under—
signed's wife talked to mentioned the presence of
the Soviet Consul, but thts certainly was neither
‘Valentin LOGINOV nor Yuriy CHERNYSH, and the
undersigned cid not met that person.

b. Whether the Cubans were invited or not,

they were not in attendance,

¢. JiP1 SVESTKA, of the Czech mibassy, was

there. Per SB Section briefing, the undersigned
mentioned hia departure and told SVESTKA that at
least he would remain in Mexico. SVESTKA said that
this would not be the case, that he.is scheduled
to leave within 15 days for Czechostovakia. The
undersigned then mentioned a conversation with his
Czech friend in which the latter told him that he
expected to stay in Mexico for quite a while longer.
SVESTKA denied eyer having said this, pointing

out that he was glad to return homé. The under=
signed made no further comments.

SECRET
ed

d. The ex-Haitian Ambassador, Julio Jean
PIERRE-AUDAIN, was geen by the undersigned but
left before he could talk to him. In view of the
foct that PIERRE-AUDAIN ceased to be Ambassador
of Haiti @ long time ago,.the undersigned feels
that.his presence at the Polish national day -
cel ‘ations: has some Significance. ‘He remembers
that: PIERRE-AUDAIN was also present at.the cele-—
bration of the Czech oational day. this year. In
other Words, the Communists have made it a point

~ to maintain contact with him, probably in view of
the fact that PIERRE-AUDAIN may return to Haiti if
something happens to DUVALIER and may secure a
position of some importance in his country.

2, The President of the Consular Association, VOURVOULIAS,
told the undersigned that: he would contact LOGINOV at the
Soviet Embassy to see. whether ‘thé latter would agree to a

~ Joint celebration of both the undersigned's and LOGINOV's

departureéa in a party to be held for both of them at.the sane
time. LOGINOV ia not scheduled to leave Mexico unti
September 1969, a departure postponed from the original
6 ule of late July or early August. a

Before leaving the party LOGINOV stated that he. would

and they met next Fridey at the Tecali. Restausant.

The conv at the Tecali 9a to an extent dealing with
the theme of friendship and understanding with an
added emphasis that if there was understanding and,
consequently, friendsehip between the U.S. and Soviet
Union ve vould be living in a. much better world.
Subject ctated his agreement with LOGs views. In a’
further part. of the conv LOGINOV was interested in
knowing whether Subject haa many friends in Mexico"
Subject clains to have stated that he had many good
friends here, (NOT%: It is quite likely that he
bragged about the nurber of influential friedds he had
here). At the end LOGINCY told Subject that he would

that he vould like to meet LIOVAL-1. SOURCE: stated.that LIOVAL was not
only a student who pays hie lesaons but was alro a. g00a friend of Source.

Then LOGINOY became quite blunt snd sgressive : he outright. demanded that -

LIBACOH introduce him to LIOVAL. LIBACON tried. to reason out with LOGINOY.
that. by meeting LIOVAL he would achieve nothing because LIOVAL wae

who is attached to hie way of life and could not care lees about Soctalian.

Repeat description: of LIOVANe personality ag he ase .

by. meeting LIOVAL. It i8 anticipated that LOGINOV
may be brief end say that thie would be his problem
and that all EXLAED LIBACON had to do is to arrange
for an introduction.

TIRACON will insists that he does not went to get
involved "in that kind of business", especially,
becaure it was clear to him that even 1f LOCINOV
achieves nothing, he lost nothing, but LIRACON ie
@ sure loser because he would lore 4. feiend and
poeeibly get tagged as a Sov spy.

If LOGIscy e688 not break off his insisting at this
point, LIBACOW will state ‘that he would agree on a

in LIBACCNS company, but no introduction of LOGINOY

Meche!and san Luis Potosie I asked Gloria if
she ware qoing to San Duis Potosi this year for the
Holy Week tennis tournaments. She said that shé had
planned to do so but was unable to find some one to
go with her.at the last moment, Pepe did not want to”
go, and would not let her go by herself unless accom
panied by several ther women or by Meche. Meche re~
fused to. go saying she would have no fuh if with her

she was annoyed #ith Pepe. She deplores his Jatin
attitude about the double standards She has been
prohibttted to take several brief trips to various
cities in Nexico to see friends and family, she is
ndt.Weicoma to accompany Pépe on his trips. Yet he
will s60n take another month off to travel either
to. Europe or. to South #merica. Gloria said that she
has been waiting all these years for her children to
gtow up Oo that she cpuld go with Pepe on his trips.
Now that ahey are grown up, she finds that she still a

is expectedc.to stay home,

Gloria watched carefully. Gloria ‘must account for
her. time very carefully to-Pepe during the day. And

under no circumstaicés can she stay out after dark.
Pepe apparently. disapproves of Gloria working for me.
He does not like the idea that she will be visiting
businessmen throughout the city both in their offices
and homes. He has expressed his disapproval, but
Gloria has chosen to ignore it. é

ae : Discussion of val. Having completed our -business
I raised. the matter of Val. I reminded her that I had
explained to her some time ago that I was annoyed with’
Val's treatment of mé in public, namely his flagrant
attempts to recruit me in the presence of mutual friends.
I told her tha € I still hadn't had a chance to talk to.
val in private. I reseated that all I wanted to do was
make it clear: to him-that I held him in great esteem as
a person, valued his friendshin,.was not interested in
assisting ‘his government, and wanted him to stop jeo=

. pardizing our fttendship with his offensive approaches,
whether subtle. and implied or direct, and coarse..

: : I told Gloria that I had planned to’ have. lunch
d with'Val ‘today. I enjoy val's companys. rarely have @ .
aise chance to chat quitelys don't like to eat luach by ‘|
ci myselfy and looked forward to explaining to val my
position before he completely destroyed any chance
for us to continue as friends.

Not aware of accident to Dmitri. I told Gloria
that Val had excused himself from our lunch date due -
to an accident to his son. She did not know of any
accident other than the dog bite the previous wééks

Gloria said that his declining my invitation
might have been an afterthought. That he did not want
to hurt my hy being seen with ma in a public place.



_.Mexicans". #

Avoids "hurting" his friends. Gloria then told me
that Jal never accented an invitation to have coffee with
her or rene or to dine out. He explained to her that it
could hurt her to ba seen with him, She gave an exam le
of when she was “Anvited to the ballet with val and a-~~
group of friends.

After the ballet, Peve and Gloria invited val to
join them for dinner. val declined. Pepe and Glorda.
went to the Hoyo 19. Shortly after they. arrived, Val
and a larae number of embassy officers also arrived.
Val steered. them away from Pepe and Gloria. Shortly
afterwards a.main arrived, sat at a remote table. and
took notes while watching the Soviets.

+ Val works mornings only. Gloria mentioned that
val is in the embassy only in the morning, This was

in response to my Statement that I had tried to call
the embassy and talk to val to find out what had hap~
pened to Dmitri, but since h¢e was out, I would’call

4n the afternoon. She added that he of course vorks

in the afternoon, but outside the embassy. I said “try-
ing to buy gringos". She said-"trying to convince

COMMENTS 7 i

_It seems to me highly unlikely that val is 7
really concerned about the welfare of his friends
geen with him. It seems quite clear that he con~
siders Gloria and Pepe, and perhaps me, as potential ©
assets, He does not want to be seen with us because
we would lose our value to hi. He told Gloria that
they should confine their contacts to the. French
Club. This seems td confirm the suspicion that. he
believes that thts-is a secure’ place to feet people.

It 4s possible that he checked with his colleagues | ~
arid they were of the opinion that my choice of the
Liave de Oro for lunch was too public, exposed. us
to toe many Americans. . :

I feel that Gloria has served a very useful
purpose in this matter. If she is working for Val,
which I doubt, she is in a position: to seo that my
business is indeed legitimate, ‘time-consuming, and
with considerable financial potential. “Further,
she is in a position to relay to val my unwillingness
to coonevate with him and his governemtn and my threat
to take the matter to the embassy if his harrassment
continues. ,

13 November 1968 -

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/IC/SB

VIA :
C/ic pier
SUBJECT. : @onsular Corps Visit to Veracruz 7
1, The undersigned visited Veracruz on 9 and 10 Novenber .

together with other members of the Consular Corps on an
official visit toe that city. ‘Although the Cubans were ;
scheduled to attend and official diplomas proclaiming them ° -
guests of the City of Veracruz were prepared, none of them
Showed up, including Lino SALAZAR Chia, who is stationed in f
Veracruz. The Czechs, East Germans, and Poles for a number

of reasons also failed to go on this trip. Thus, the only
Communist representative was Valentin Sergéyevich LOGINOV, *. ~
with whom the undersigned had plenty of opportunity to talk.

It seems that LOGINOV, at least for public consumption,
considers the undersigned "his friend." LOGINOV was’ accompa--

nied by his wife,

2, The following were the main points of interest
discussed. by LOGINOV:

a. The Soviet appeared very anxious to get :
the undersigned's opinion on a subject to which he re
kept going back time and again during the visit:
the position of the. Richard H. NIXON administration
vis-a-vis Communist China, Specifically, what

that the NIXON administration might attempt to bring
about a rapproéchement between Communist China and
the United States. LOGINOV approached this topic a
from various directions, and the undersigned had oe
the distinct impression that he had received a

speciric query on this subject. At one point,

LOGINOV stressed the importance of Communist China

to his country, “indicating that bis. government is
becoming increasingly concerned with developments

there. ‘ Es :

Poa



SECRET

-2-

b. Connected with the above was LOGINOV's
concern for peace in Vietnam... For the first time
| that the undersigned can remeber, a Soviet stated
| that the United States and his country had "a
{ common interest of utmost importance" in bringing
peace to Vietnam, That the Soviet interest may
:be connected with their concern about Communist
| “China was indicated by LOGINOV when the latter
| indicated that peace. should be obtained in Vietnar
as a way to keep out the Chinese Communists.

This did not prevent LOGINOV from making the usual
noises in favor of the National Liberation Front
and the Vietcong, blasting away at South Vietnamese
nilitarism.

¢. While talking about the Middle East,
LOGINOV said that the Soviet Union was in the
Mediterranean to stay and fully intended .to give
such support to the Arab nations in that area as
to someday "get rid of Israel." LOGINOV specifically
stated, "The Jews have it coming to them, and the
day of reckoning is coming." The undersigned was
curious to -know whether this was prompted on
LOGINOV'S part by a-dislike of the Israclis or an
anti-Semitic feeling. LOGINOV was quite blunt and
categorically stated that he for one "hated all
Jews," and ‘did not hide-his profound anti-Semitism.
LOGINOV ‘added that Jews are parasites who have
little natYonalism other than that generated by the
Zionist cause, lic implied that those Jews left in
the Soviet Union are foreigners who.have done little
to help the Soviet cause. The undersigned pointed .
out that anti-Semitism has been a long Russian
tradition, dating back to before the Revolution,

. + and deplored this obvious discrimination. He added
that this reminded him of the anti-Semitism of the
party which not so.long ago made mass murder of
Jews a matter of national policy. — :

qd. It took LOGINOV about one day to bring. up
the Sucesos ‘para Todos article. The undersigned
jokingly asked him whether this was a Soviet or
Cuban sponsored joke, saying that rumor had it that
Sucesos was financed by both the Soviets and the

SECRET



}
H

- ~

SECRET

=3-

.Cubans. LOGINOV denied this, saying that the staff

of Sucesos could not be put by any stretch of the
imagination into the category of "Communists." He.
then point-ilank asked the undersigned whether he
belonged to the organization mentioned in the
article. The undersigned laughingly answered that
if ‘such trashy publications as Sticesos were believed
by anyone "of course he belonged to that organization.
LOGINOV laughed and made a few more noises about how
Sucesos obtained the undersigned's name. The latter
replied that his name was probably selected at
random from stolen pages of the mnbassy directory
or other such document. ‘He added that if LOGINOV
had wanted his phone number he would have been glad
to have given it to him rather than see it appear
in Suceses.

e. The discussion the undersigned had with
LOGINOY in Guadalajara about the KGB was apparently
not forgotten by the Soviet, for the latter pulled
out of his purse a copy of the stamp commemorating
some KGB anniversary that the undersigned had
mentioned to him. The undersigned has no idea of
the reasons for this gesture. One of the topics
which seems to embarrass LOGINOV the most is the
humber of visas he signs at the Soviet Embassy.
Whenever LOGINOV gets a littlé too pointed in his. |
provocations, the undersigned raises this subject, |
with LOGINOV invariably giving a little laugh and:
no. answer. i

f. LOGINOV indicated that he. was. aware tha’
the ‘undersigned had met with Jiri SVESTKA at the i
time of the Soviet intervention. in- Czechoslovakia. :
and asked for his opinion of SVESTKA, The undersigned
made no bones about the fact that he had a long lunch
with thé Czech. He said he had found him to be ‘muy
de la izquierda," adding that unfortunately SVESTKA |
belonged to the very small minority of his country
which had wolcomed Soviet intervention. The under~*
signed predicted that the Soviets would have con= /
siderable trouble with Czechoslovakia and pointed
out that this serious error had tarnished the cause |

|

of the Soviet Union, Ne said, for example, that

the Soviet interventiea was very unpopular in Mexico.
This seemed to draw a little blood from LOGINOV, as
he abruptly interrupted the aera ees and asked,

“Where. is it popular?"

Like this, which did not take. into consideration the fact °
that. such anti-Communists as Jan MASARYK and Eduard BENES
were the fathers of the Czech state. SVESTKA then went on to
say,that indeed neither NASARYX nor BENES had been Comaunist,
put that neither had any deep knowledge of the inborn desires
ef the Czech people. ‘The undersigned told him that this
was enough to make both MASARYX and BENES turn over in their
graves. He pointed out that there nad been a violent exchange,
according to the Mexican press, between the Czech and Soviet .
papers over MASARYK, with the Russians saying that MASARYK
had participated in an attempt to kill Nikolai LENIN, CHERNYSH
said that this was-a pack of lies, that he had reviewed the
Soviet press for that period and found nothing about MASARYK.
This was quickly endorsed by. SVESTKA. When the undersigned
once more stated his belief that people who had known better
would take the first opportunity to overthrow Communism, both
CHERNYSH and SVESTKA started speaking at the same time. . The
undersigned pointed out that the Russian people had never
‘anything other than a curb on personal freedom and very
ng ¢entral government, but the.Czecas, the Poles, the .
Hangarians, and. others had known diffezeatiy. Such people
were thirsty for personal freedcus and direct control over
ineir destiny, When CHERNYSH said he doubted this, the uader-
signed reminded him that it was Russian tanks that had crushed
the students and workers' revolt in iungary in 1956. He also
pointed to the recent guiet but radical revolution which had
taken place in Czechoslovakia, saying that, for example, vhe
day after the right to strike'had been re-established practi-,
cally all Workers-struck to protest 20 years of mismanagement,
poor housi: and lack of freedom. From that point on SVESTKA

in Polanco, where’ the undersigned estimated that the crowd

numbered at t_150 people. The only other Americans
present were head of thé Political
Section, and ifr. David N. WIESLEY, Honorary Consul of Iceland.

The undersigned was a little bit surprised to see Rodolphe
BABOUN, the new Haitian Acting Ambassador, in attendance with
a colored Haitian. BABOUN, as a matter of fact, spoke briefly
to the Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas.

i :
2s The undersigned had several little discussions with’
diri. SVESTKA, Czech Consul and known intelligence officer.
When he casually reniinded SVESTKA that Czechoslovakia was an
industrial. power before World War I-and that Czech products
flooded Western Europe, SVESTKA sharply commented that his
country wad still an industrial power. When the undersigned
mentioned that MASARYK was very popular in the United States,
SVESTKA counte¥ed that that was no doubt because he had lived
as an exile in the United States. . SVESTKA cut short a remark
by the undersigned about the. effort currently being made to
throw light on MASARYK's death by saying, "There is no doubt
that he committed siiicide." SVESTKA showed himself on this
eccdsion a rival of LOGINOV as far as provocations are
- coacerned. After the undersigned answered comments on. the
Negro problem and forthcoming urban terrorism and guerrilla
arfare in-the United States, SVESTKA mentioned the “overt
letter" to ‘the American Ambassador which appeared in various
» local newspapers. He hinted that the incident “described” EE

7 SECRET

Po t7Id



in tho opon letter was not only a blunder on the. part of
Ambassador FREEMAN, but also indicative of the superiority
complex of ‘the United States. At one point, when Valentin
LOGINOV had joined in the discussion, the undersigned retorted
“that the min who had written the article was a fourth-class.
‘riter without a diméwho somehow had found the thousands. of ie
Pesos nocossary to placé his editorial. | When the Czech and
the Russian laughed, the undersigned continued that. if the.
Soviet. union wanted to give money to the Mexican Communist
Party to ongage in such shenanigans ‘to amuse the local members
of socialist countries, it was fine with the Américans, as
this is just about all it could hope to achieve. SVESTKA

and LOGINOV naturally denied ‘that their countries had anything
to do with tho Mexican Communist Party, not to speak of the
overt letter on the Ambassador, The undersigned, tongue in
cheek, thon pointed out that he was glad to tell them for
their information that a Communist Party did exist in Mexico.
Perhaps the most interesting réaction of SVESTKA came towards
the end of tho:party just before the undersigned left. iz
During a discussion which included SVESTKA, LOGINOV, one ‘of
the Soviet military attaches (a tall colonel with white hair),
another Russian, and a-youngish, stort, and chubby member of
the Mexican Foreign Ministry the undersigned expressed a
thoucht that the two systems of government, the capitalist and ~
the soviet, were gradually inching.closer together. When
SVESTKA allowed himself to-doubt it with a nasty little laugh
the undersigned naturally could not resist telling him to
have a look at what was Soing on in his country. The reaction
of SVESTKA Was both immediate and noticeable. He sort of
straightened out, jerked his head back, opened his mouth,
dropped tho ashes of his cigar on the floor, and obviously
- bit his tongue as he said nothing. From the above-and from.
the fact that SVESTKA. plans to drive to the next Consular
Association meeting in Guadalajara with his Soviet colleagues,
the undersigned feels that SVFSTKA isnot only a lackey of the
€X-NOVOTNY regime, but very Probably in the employ of the
_ Soviet KGB. He ‘seems to be inseparable from LOGINOV and has
lately, mouthed the same provocations in the same techniques,
showing himself more and more aggressive, a thing which he
was not a year ago.

3. Among other nasty little remarks made by LOGINOV,.
including references to tho open letter against the Ambassador,

_the war in“Vietnam, the Negro problem, the difficult financial

-position of ‘the dollar, et cetera, was a reference to this
Station LOGINOV. at one point asked the undersigned where _
he worked (not the. first time he hasaeked this),~ The under=
signed told him ‘that he worked .in the: Consular General's
Office. . LOGINOV then said, "What about the fifth. floor?"

The undersigned told him that the fifth floor comprised both
the- Ambassador's Office and the Political Section. LOGINOV
went on to say something like, '"I know about the Ambassador,
but what about the other offices, those occupied: by WOFIRM?”
The undersigned let that one go by as LOGINOV had obviously
found it very funny. fie proceeded to pay back the Soviets a
littte later by counting on his fingers the number of visas
issued at the Soviet Embassy each year, the number of cultural
exchanges handled by the Embassy, staff,--and:"all tho work
done for trade promotion with Mexico." ~The undersigned felt -
tha ‘the Soviets probably issued some five visas.a month, if
thac many, had about ten cultural exchanges a year, and had
practically no trade with the Mexicans. What, thon, he asked,
were the 40 odd "diplomats" in the Soviet Embassy doing in
Mexico? LOGINOV laughed, but he laughed green and promptly
broke off. this conversation.

4. The undersigned had no opportunity to talk at any
length with Ambassador HANUS, who was very busy at the
reception. --The Ambassador, how.ver, greeted him warmly and
gave him a prolonged bear hug as he left. The undersigned
had no talk with the Cubans except a few words which he
exchanged with Sergio MARTINEZ, whom he, had not met before.

2 LOGINOV. Subject reported that LOGINOV called hin at.
his factory in Cuernavaca on Friday, 3 yay. LOGINOV said he

had some visitors who would like to buy a few things to take

i. back with them to Russia and asked. if it would be convenient if
he brought them down to Subjéct's factory on saturday afternoon,

{c) The son of one of the above two women. He appeared :
to be about 12 years old, - ‘ :
4e LUGINOV and his three companions shopped for about an
hour while Subject worked in his office, and in the end bought

450«500 pesos worth of merchandise (at wholesale prices, of
course). Subject.and the four Russians then left together,
got into their respective cars, and drove to. Subject's home with
Sub Jeet. leading the way. When they were. driving into Subject's
driveway, Subject, in View of his wife pb two children and the
four Russians, accidentally ran over and broke the back of one
of the BESABERS! beloved dachshunds. Chaos reigned for the :
next ten minutes as Subject went into the house, got his pistol, -
and returned and shot the dom while the children screamed, Mrs.
BESABER tried to suppress her ow tears and shoo away the children
at the same time, and the four Russians sat aghast in their car
and: watched. LOGINOV acted extremely sorry and did his best to
console Mrs. BESABER and Subject, Mrs. BSSABER recovered quickly,
however, and sooa had all the adults seated in the living room.
Subject served the first round of drinks, and within a half hour
everyone was at least reasonably relaxed azains i sreeiente
5. LOGINOV was the only one who did not take an alcoholic
drink, He wore dark sunglasses all afternoon and explained that:
he had to stay away from liquor because he was taking antibiotics
for an eve infection, Despite this ailment and inability to
take o drink, LOGINOV was nevertheless more sociable and friendly.
than Subject had ever seen hime He also struck Subject as being



_ was going to have to hold off on a definite anawer until later

mors relaxed than in the paste He brourht the BRSABERS. two
bottles of vodka and two cans of caviar, asked why Subject
hadn't called or visited him at the Embassy, addressed Subject. diveereseece
only as "tu" (where he had formerly mixed “tus” and "usteds”
with Subject). enthusiastically toured the BESABERS* new house,
and patiently translated for the two Russian women, aeither of
who spoke Spanish or English. The conversation was generally
dull, however, and. nothing éven. mildly controversial was
discussed. The Russians finally left about 1700.

6. In the course of the conversation, Mrs. BFSABER asked
LOGINOV when they were ever going to get together to play tennta.

: (Mrs. BESABER had of course previously invited LOGINOY to play

tennis with her sometime at the home of a retired American | oH

gentleman in Cuernavaca (deesy who was &
good friend and who had an exceptionally good court.) LOGINOV

replied that he still wanted very, much to play, but that it was
always a question of time for him. "why didn't LOGINOY come down
to Cuernavaca next Saturday morning {11 Mcy)?* Subject interjected.’
He (10cTKO¥) and Mrs. BRSABER cou)d play tennis in the morning while
Subject! wag working» and then they could all spend the afternoon
at home relaxints LOGINOV replied that that sounded great, but
asked what he" was going to do with his wife and child. Mrse
BESABER’ angwared that of course they éxpected him to bring Mra.
LOGINOV:and-the child with him. LOGINOV said that vould be

very intee and he'd like to accept the invitation right at that
ponent, but he eas afraid that -his schedule was such that ho

call you?* Well, replied LOGINOV, why didn't they leave it that
if he didn't hear from Subject, he would call Subject, and
vice versas Subject agreed. if

7. Subject said he waited until Friday morning, 10 May,
to hear from LOGINOV, and when LOGINOV didn't call, he calied
LOGINOV (confirmed by LIENVOY). LOGINOV,. according to Subject,
said he was afraid he was not going to be able to make it, after ;
all, because the Mayor of Moscow was. visiting Mexico. and he would)
be tied up with the Mayor on Saturday. Subject said he suggested |
that perhaps they could make it for the following Saturday, then, |
LOGINOV replied that he thought he might be able to make it then, |
but, again, he couldn't say for sure just then. “But anyway,” |
LOGINOV added, “we're going to be seeing each other more often
because we've (ee., the Soviet Embassy) taken a house on Calle
Umbolt (in Cuernavaca) for the summer, and I'l) be coming down
to Cuernavaca every weekend.” Subject expresséd pleasure at
this and said that he'd expect to hear from LOGINOV sometime

BEVEEP called Subject in Cuernavaca about 14,00

on 10 May. He said he wanted to tell Subject that a Polish musical

Group was about to open at Bellas Artes and. would be playing sone.
of Subject's geandfatherts music. (Subject's paternal grandfather

was a pupil of Franz Liszt and, according to Subject, is generally

regarded in ‘Poland as the second greatest Polish composer next
to Chopin.) BEWERP asked if Subject was goirg to be in Mexico :
City the following week and if he'd have time to accompany
BEXFEP to Dellas Artes for a perforzance. Subject said that
unfortunately, he wouldn't be able to Re, but suggested that



REWEEF bring the musicians te his home in Cuernavaca for an
afternoon. BEVEEP said he wasn't sure if they could work it
into their schedule, but ne'd check anc ict Subject know if thoy

he is pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths

and positive qualities and tends to minimize or overlook negative

i We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and
Communism several times, and he has always come out a strong

: she United States. The brother is married to an American and

| . : : lives im Virginia, where he is in the construction business.

One of the sisters is also married to an American aad lives in
Californi: (I believe San Francisco}. The second sister is
married to a Polish immigrant and lives with him in Chicago.

The sister in C"1ifornia is a naturalized American citisen, The

brother and the sister in Chicago are not.

5+ Om 2h April 1967, LIEWOY reported the following call
from OAZIYEV ‘to LOGINOV:
‘ GAZ: "I saw him, he arrived yesterday.”



o>

LOG: "Excellent, Then I'd like to see you to discuss
certain thinga.”

GAZ "Then I can come there tomorrow?”

LOG: "No, better Wednesday."

GAZ: "All right. He usually comes there at 6 o'clock.

H He got married and came here with his wife. Now

t they look for an apartment. I'11 go there on the

E 10th, because I want to attend courses in English.
This week -I'll be busy.” L

"L0G "OK, until the next then.” | :
6. From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEV was

probably talking about Subject, since: i
(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North : |

American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had

GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted

with GAZIYEV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject

an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although

Subject told me he had not gone).
(b) Subject hed gotten married that months
(c) Subject had just returned to Mexico. with his brides
(d) Subject and his wife were looking for an apartments
(e) subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800
to teach evening Spanish classes.

_ 7s Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had
considered using Subject as.an access agent against GAZIYEV,
but had decided not to approach Subject on the patter unless
there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV was
developing into something more than occasional chats between
classes. I did not see much potential in approaching Subject

before this with tnezade the idea of having him deliberately
cultivate a friendship with GAZIYEV, as I felt Subject waa living



A such a busy and hectie life that I would get very little out
of hin. Prior to his marriage, he was ‘koeping such a hectic
schedule between his Institute and private classes that he
i wasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing :
: problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health :
problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the
_ Job with the American School (although he gave up most of his

private classes). - :
8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject 's

relations with the Soviets look much more interesting, I attempted
to find out what I could about then from Subject... For a number

of reasons, -however--including ny going to the States in June--
a were not able to get together until 12 July. On that date
I took Subject to a belated “bachelor's lunch" at_a little
Spanish restaurant downtowns :

9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.
aay I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would

around to GAZIYEV, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV ..”

was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally
0 chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one
Pan of the. near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between
i 5 | the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed
| “ talking with GAZITEV, as he was a simpatico, interesting guy,

as well as an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that
they never talked politics. In reply to an offhind question
about whether he had aet any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject



‘do?

said that he had not. My inclination waa to believe Subject, and
I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been
talking about someone else over the phone or that they had

never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about Subjects
10.. Onl N,venber 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother

"Javier in Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a

quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffee.
As. soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had ‘a problem and
would like my advices He said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation
to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet
Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience,
he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black
list" at the U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had
tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to
ask my advice, but had been told I was out of tom. (I was in
El Paso from 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been
able to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply
walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security

department" about his predicament. what. did I think he should

11, I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the
U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice
other than to tell him that; it was entirely his ow business
whether he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I
asked, what made Subject thi ie name would be put on a
"black list" ag he wente Subject replied that he didn't know

how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew" the U.S»
Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went in and out of


the Soviet Bnbassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Eebassy
7 refused to give him any advice, at least it would make a record
cf of his visit and anyone who ws ever interested would his
heart was in the right place. He. simply did not want and couldn't
afford to get into any trouble with the U.S, Bnbassy, he said.
after ali, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the
int “States to study sometime, and they might even want to go to
the States to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very

‘

I became more serious myself and told him that just so ©

‘serious,
he wouldn't worry, I'd write a mete to the proper Enbassy
‘ department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had z
oe told me he planned to attend a Soviet-Eubassy reception, but
: q __ wished the U.S, Bubassy to know he vas doing it solely out of
a :
ee curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Unions
a Subject seemed greatly relieved and thanked me very much.
liga - 12. Seizing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given Subject. the
: invitation, I asked if Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject
rat ss ‘peplied that yes, he still saw him ee ant GAZIYSY was
tot now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on his
eee reece own’ initiative, that he. had also been to GAZIYEV's. apartrent
Ba twice and — another Soviet there on one occasion. He said |
j that the first time he went to GAZIEV's was shortly before he
ii i (subject) got married (sinject #? was married about mid-April
ant 1967) and the second time was shortly after his mrriage, as he
‘and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS'. .Subject finished |

eating about this time, and since he was ina hurry and had

his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,
but decided to wait and have a second go at him alone another

assurances that thers ‘was no reagon for him not to Bo, he

Played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested
in anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet

he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.
Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisffed he answered
my questions to the best of his ability. It seewed to me, and>
still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject
had not told me on 11 duly what he subsequently told me on

l November (i.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and

on one occasion had met another Soviet theré). This was that

| | i he felt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting

the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too

4 hard (which I didntt on 12 July), he felt more comfortable
ignoring it. The reason he so readily mentioned the two visits
and the other Soviet on 1 November was, I think, that he was

Embassy over attending the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to
impress me with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and
{ felt obliged to completely clear the record by mentioning tho
| visits to GAZIYEV's home and meeting the other Soviet thera. :
15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his
- apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) went to
/ Chicago.to get married. -This means that the dinner took place
about tild-Mareh 1967, Subject said he had expected to find
i only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third
i i Person was there when Subject arrived. Subject said GAZIYEV
introduced the third person as Valentin "something." when I
asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject immediately reacted
and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject'’s description
of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV:. GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was
with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and
described KOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening
started off very casually, with LOGINOVY expressing interest :
in the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.
LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most
of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get
a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject af
“he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to
start with, ete, Subject replied that he'd be happy to, ‘although
| ey it didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed’ much instruction in
Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed
4 ; LOGIMOV would drop around to the Institute sometime soon.

LOGINOV, wno took the lead in the conversation most of, the
evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subject
1



with "no doubt" that he (LOGINCY) waa trying to feol Subject out
on his political views. Subject said that he couldn't remember

: most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV
began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't
find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish
than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory

i | romarks about the extent of Amrican influence in Mexico. Subject

) said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so

' platantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation

and told LOGINOV that before they went any farthor, he thought

LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was

"100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely

no sympathy with Communism, (While this sounds awfully blunt

| and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good
ie my eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to

be &8* a bit blunt at times, and knowing his ideological leanings,.
:I would not. put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subject
‘ said that LOGINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the
: conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject
‘ commented that he had a pretty good idea of vhat the Soviets were
up'to in Mexico. When LOGINOY asked what Subject meant, Subject
,Felated the story he once told me about having been in Veracruz
a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put
_under arrest there. Subject told LOGINoy that “everyone knew
the ship was loaded with Commnist propaganda.”

16, After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politics {

|

were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.

Sudject said that LOGINOY seemed somewhat irritated with him, but
on the wiole kept his composure very well and treatod Subject
politely for the two hours or less Subjoct remained. As Subject
was leaving, LOGINOV again said he'd come by the Institute to

‘late "1967" Subject saw LOGINOV at the gas station on the corner
of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOV greeted Subject by

nate. However, they did not converse with each other.

17.° Subject. said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically.
related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred
to the evening again. However, a few weeks after Subject
returned to Moxico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and his
wife over to dinner {this would place the second dinner in
about nid-May), This time GAZIYEV and his wife were the only
pthers present, and the evening passed without any reference
to politics. Subject stated that he still occasionally goes
across the street fora cup of coffee with GAZIYEV betweem
eVening classes at the Institute, but that he has: not. been
to GAZIYEV! s apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his
home. :

18, Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose
in meeting him was ‘to assess his exploitability, he did not seem
to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for
LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I
spelled this out for Subject’ and also informed him that LOGINOV.
was an exceptionally capable Soviet intelligence officer. I
also explained that it was very possible CAZIYEV was using the
Institute to spot other candidates for interviews with Soviet

intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV's

activities and contacts at the Institute. iivwever, Subject said

that as far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself
at the Institute and did not have any particudar friends there
whom Subject knew about, Subject said he would keep his eyes
however, and. would
let me know af he came onto anything interesting. Subject also
offered to "play up to” GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance

afer wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions

of appreciation.
196 The question that remains unanswered after all this is,

of courses, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV were talking about Subject

over the phone on 2 April 1967. According to Subject, the
dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in Narch 1967, while
LOGE NOV did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took

GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife

Subject's office to announce that he was back from home i

tourist office, PRIKHODKO said that the Mexican Government had :
turned it down. Specifically SALVAT had told the Soviets that :
the tourist exchange between the Soviet Union and Mexico was
1 go insignificant that it did not justify a reciprocal exchange
ij of tourist offices (Comment: . Kvidentally the Mexicans used

the reciprocity issue to deny the Soviet request.)

about willing to be friends but refusing to help the Soviets

1. In reviewing LOGINOV’s SPR which WEENING has ‘just

1938 months ago and that his first requirement was on the _
BOESTROM couple, At that time we gave LITEMPO~8 traces on
LOGINOV saying that he was a dangerous KGB officer,
LITEMPO-8 subsequently mentioned that the case was continued

and that be, himself, was directing it. -/

23. If you think that LITEMPO-8 will. cooperdte, I would
like to know the-following about ba case;

(a) Is it still active?

(b) Did the policeman pass info to LOGINOV.
‘on the BOESTROM couple? If so, what? Was
there any follow-up?

(c). What type of requireneits has LOGINOV
given to the policeman? Are any Americans
involved?

(a) Have any other Soviets been involved dith

TANG wae a member of the Chinese Im staff here, dbecauee he did not find
hie name in the diplomatic liet. Further, he told § that he waa doing a
good job, which he appreciated, but he must be very cautious because the
Chinese are clever people and extremely suspicious.

6. “Ta reply to S'question LOG stated that™fcr anyone of them (Sov
Emb offioial)would meet with TANG, because that it too dengerous. § quee
ried what was dangerous about it and LOG steted that there was always

@ chance that they (TANG and LOS or another Sov) might be seen together
and that would be very bad. 5 went On to tell S that it would be his

job to develop friendly relatione with TANG ot possibly another Chinese
offioial and slowly obtain from him the info LOG and bis embassy needed,
LOG will guide him ae to how to go about it and if they show confidence
in § he will have it made and Sove (‘L0G used the expression: VE ) would
pay him very well for that job. £ commented that he had believed that
what he wae doing he did out of personal friendship with LOG and not

for money. LOG emiled at §' statement and added that in addition to meney
they (Sovs) enable & to travel to Eov Union and heve a vacation on the
Bleok Sea. :

7. While § was thinking whether to say something or keep quiet, LOG
told him that the next. time he went to TANG he should limit hie conv

to the publishing of the article about Net Ohina and if neéded 4 deny
that he had any cohtaot with his Sov friend (0G) since he met TANG, §*
job ie to win. TAGE confidence and that is a slow process with the
Chinese. Then, in anewer to LOGB queation 8 stated that there were to
Mexicans ( @ woman end a man ) working at the Chinese Emb. 10¢ told him
to got their nemee and eddrensee. § commented that thie wae not sa simple —
an it sounded, beonuse one cannot juet.ask a person what wae his name
Bnd address. LOG commented that even thie wae a matter which eannot be
Fushed: firet get their nazes and lator obtain the addresay 4

8, Thore wos another thing § should dot find out how pony Chinese
live in Mexico Oity and detersined Ghichonee were the tnfluentiolone and
@eong the latterones deteraine whieh aro the oot influential; he can
etart working on thie by dropping 4A & better Chinese restaurant and
trying to develop acso Bequaintancoa; it oan de aveumed that thooe who

ueuallu fafluential. & agreed with LOG and oxpested LOG to tell him that |
he would pay for the vie!ting of Ohinese resteurante, but LOG kept

quiet.

9. & naa no. intention to skip the talk about money and he told hin
that the publishing of the artiele about Sat Ohina may end in a blind alley
if TANG doés not supply at least a half a page of advertising. LOG 4ié

not want that to happen and he told 6 that he (L0G) would give him

KY 1,000.- if the printing of the article should be held because of lack
of advertising. S brought to LOG’ attention that half of page of advertising
‘brings to Pierre (RUDIAN) 1,500.- pesos. L0G felt that he would pay that
money @8 8 price of keeping the door open to the Chinese Emb for §. To
put eome coating on the pill §-added that he would try to obtain an ad
or two from Ohinese restaurants, but he daoubted ‘that the owners would
be intereated in advertising in a magazine which is far from being well |
known. Just the idea that § conteplated going to Ohinese restaurants
plessed 106G's ear.

10. 109 was interested in the status of the Presidential race and |
8 told him that it narrowed down to four candédates and that all the |
indicatione were in the direction that ECHZVARRIA was to be the official |
PRI candidate. § believed that by Aug 20 he would know the name of the
candidate. In reply to L0G'a question S stated that the candidate will

be publically known Sept. 15-20,

ll. LOG wanted to give more time to be positive of the name of the
Presidential candidate and he decided that their next (business) meet would
de on dug 25 at the same rine and place. 106 immediately added that he

did not forget that 9 virthdey wae on dug 15 and that he believed that

it would be the best if they calabrated together in Guautla on Baa Aug 16.
LOG added that on that day his wife and son would be with him in Cuautle
and § should bring along Josephine; Log will bring a bottle of *Russien®
champaign and pic-nic style food; there will be bottle of Vodka for

Subject bad been in Evrore and Israel icr several weeks since’
our last meeting. Nothing of particular interest developed on this
trip. +

Before he left,°Subject was invited by NECHIPGRENRO (P-7442) to
celebrate the latter's birthday (which happens to be 4 Juay). Subject
tried to beg off but NECHIPORENKO refused to take no for an answer
and actuaily came to Subject's apartment with KOSTIKOV to bring |,
Subject to NECHIPORENKO'’S apartment. Since NECHIPOASNKO's wife
away, three ziris from the Pianitsky Chorus were awaixing che :tarce
men, Considerable drinking was done and Subject said it was obvious
why they had asked him since the third girl needed a partner, Her oamo
was Nina BUCHARGVA. Subject said that all of the girls were quite
attractive and “available for anything." Subject said that he: under-
stood that most of the girls in the Chorus fit this category and that
they would simply wait until their housemother was asleep before
going out and getting some action, <¢ H

Subject and NECHIPORENKO actually have a good personal relationship.

Subject solved a mystery Of vhero OLATETNER wan during his recent
visit. Subject had ret GESTHTNEN at tho airport and had vine and
dined his sanity during eoat of ‘the Cine that GrSTUT.nR van here. No
wonder GEITETNLA had ao tine for LIEW TYeS or anybody else,

#7 continued .
Subiect DelToves that NECHIPORENKO is’ very intelligent, He speaks
je best Spa Soviets known to Subject and due to
Y 83 well’as his looks, can pass for a Mexican, Subject
XCHIPORENKO was given the task of cultivating and
attemptirg to re-recruite hin aftor LOGINOY failed. Subject had
Some interesting comments about LOGINOY {P-11,712) which seem to
_ dive with crber com ents which have been made about him, LOGINOV
had Spparently originally been given the task of re-recruiting
Subject.- When he failed, he felt rebuffed nnd has since been very
cool towards Subject. Subject believes that LOGINOV either has or
thinks he has -been given bad marks by his superiors for having
failed with Subject, =LOGINOV is Probably jealous or NECIHIPORENKO who
has at least managed to retain Subject's friendship, Subject says

-—_that"LOGINOV is act dumb and that he uses his good looks to great

Advantage Particularly with women,

. Subject has recently had some dealings with IVANOV (P-1612) who
is furious for the following reason: Formerly Soviots leaving Mexico
Would take KLM or Sabena to Eutope where they would pick up Aeroflot
the following day. KLM and Sabena: would pay overnight hotel costs,
Now, however, the Soviets are Picking up Aeroflot in New York,
Because of Scheduling, however, they still must spend at least one
night in New York. Thé airlines will not pay this and IVANOV wanted
Subject to cover it, Subject refused for the very sound reason that
At did not make sénse for him to pay $20 for selling a $127 ticket

[from which his profit was only $9, IVANOV became furious and Subject
* ylelded by. agreeing to pay for -IVANOV's accommodations and he said he
would do it for those becoming as friendly, such as NECHIPORENKO, but
he would not do it as a general rule, While Subject was away,
however, his wife went overboard aud got IVANOV four rooms ~(for two
People), Now Subject is furious.

On 31 July Subject’ was visited by PRIKHODKO (P-2270) who came
in carrying a. copy of Pravda or Izvestiya, Subject quoted the old
saw, "There is no truth in Pravda and 10 news in Izvestiyz," and
PRIKHODKO got mad claiming Subject was acting very unfriendly by
making anti-Soviet propaganda, PRIKHODKO wos. very serious. This is
Probably as good and as accurate a thvmbnail sketch on PRIKHODKO that
we arevlikely to get. PRIKHODKO, Who s2id that he was leaving in
Septeyber, had visited Subject to find vut what Subject knew about
@ congress of Jewish intellectuals which is to be held in mid-September

in Bogota to discuss the Jewish problem in the Soviet Union, PRIKHODKO ~

wanted to know whe was going from Mexico. Subject told PRIKHODKO that
he had not heard 3f the congress but world check into it. He did check
with someonw ai the Israeliac Enbassy ure was dorrified to learn

that word had gotten our since at this time knowledge of the congress
is confidential. Subject told me that he would tell PRIKHODKO that

he had been unable to le-rn anything, reasoning that to te] hia about

At would get him involved with further requirements and would te working _

against the best ‘interests of the Jews, I told Subject that I
agreed completely, _

Subject said-that the Sputnik §Broup which was due in June never
did get Mexican visas aad their trip-hos been cancelled, On the other
hand, a delegation of about a dozen Soviets is due in August for a
Congress of eye, ear, nose, and throat S5pectalists, and still another
group of a dozen. is due in Septomber for a congress of soll mechanics,
Since these are official delegates as opposed to tho sputnik group who
vere tourists, they will-bave no troublo getting Noxtcan visas,

2. On Priday Aug 1 at 1400 bre $ celled on OWIN@USIZE TANG, Minieter
Oounselek of tha Neat Chinese Emb at his office, The purpose of the
eall was to explain that the magazine La Mision goes to press the latest
on the 18th of the month and it wae too late to have anything published
on Net, Obina. In accordance with the instruotion § received from Pierre
RUDIAN, 8 told TANG that in publiching euch articles the magazine writes
then sogording the wishes of the embassy of the country about which
they are written, Because embassies pay only the subscription, they
usually eee to it that at least a halt of page of advertising ia in-
eluded in the same issue. .
Se TANG expreased pes p nor taaed for such a pestis and stated that
he wae intereated in hevPHBTAR"ERtiole on the Republic of Ohina and
probably one on ChiensXax-Shek and that he would ree to it that a proper
amount of ads be purchased.
4. TANG went on to ask which eutsaries are subscribers of the
mogesine and which use it for publishing articles, 5 stated that precticale
ly all enbsaesics are subsoribers add almost all of them had their erticlea
published at one tise or the other. TANG, apparently, wae not estiafied
with this anewer and he asked point fig blane was the gov Embassy @ sub=
soribor,
a

than 8 anewnved affirmatively. TANR aeked 8 did he know onybody



; gale

\ cet tee
in.the Sov Embassy, 8 stated tuat ue was on friendly terme with an
official of the Sov Embassy. TANG commented that thie wae vinsual, decauee
Sove saké- frends with nobody. § stated again that he had no other way
of calling hie relation with the.Sov official than a personal friendship.
In reply to TAG queation § etated that he prefered not to mention the
nese of bis Sov friend and. TANG asked what position did ae Sov friend
have. & replied that an far as he knew the Sov offietal wae quite bigh up
(G40). TANG continued his questioning: what was the nature of § relation-
ship with the Sov, wae it a bisiness type relationship; how often dé they
see eaoh other; where da they meet. S stated that he never transacted
any busines with the Sov and they meet about twice a month for a dinner
or lunch in varioue resteurante. § added that the Sov plays tennie every
week~end and that he (2) sonetine goes to watoh him playing (Note: the
latter statement ie not true). TANG asked did 8 play tennis and he an-
swered negatively.
6. At thie point 8 asked wae he interested in: meeting hie Sov friend
end TANG stated that be waa. Then, 8 asked tek¢ TANG whet should he say
to his Sov friend. TANG commented that thie was a good question and he
told $ that he would think about it. Consequently, he asked 8 could he
pass by on Nonday or Tuesday (Aug 4 or 5 ) and S said he would.
Te Tu reply to Fe question & stated that he intended to tell L0G
exactly what tranpired on his meet with TANG and that he planned
visiting TAN on: Monaday so that he would be able to tell LOO did TAND-
decide to meet LOG.
8. FP told § that he was going too far in pleasing LCG and. was
getting in a deeper and deeper mess by retting involved with the Nat
Ghineses it was obvious from the attitued of Kr. TANG that he read him
through and wae taking his time to findScould he benifit. something out
of the whole scheme. Therefore, 5 shoald aleo take it easy and not
Tush to see TANG on Monday, 1.¢. before seeing LOG; further, he chould
stick to hie previous decision that it waa rather dangeroue to be
weeting with L6s often. :
9. $ felt that LOG would prese for a moet wath § se soon as porsible
once he got to know that TANG had opened the poseibdlity of wanting to
pect with LOG. F considered thie to be poerible and iepredsed on 8 that

it wae up to him to etall.
10.
on account of his aesceciation with LOG. F replied that he was trying to
inatruot him how to keep out. of troubles and it appeared that 5 did not
care much about whet F was telling him. ¢ reacted quite strénily to Fe
statement by eaying that F wae wrong, or at lenet incorrectly interpreted
8 attitude: ae fer ‘ae he (S) is concerned tz he ia willing to discontinue
meeting with LOG immediately, if we tell him to do eo. F answered that

if we wanted him to drop LOG we would had told him to do it, Nevertheless,
$ as an American is certainly avare of the fact that the US Service and,
consequently, the US security is getting nothing out of S collaboratton
with LOG; in view of the fact that-LOG will remain here only about 2 nthe
more we felt it would be. the best to leave the matter take 15 nortiel
cogree end find itsnatural ends we were and continue to be interested

in keepin}iBut of trouble, but to achieve this tte moet important thing
was that he carry out our instruction as he received it; we badly need EE
that 9 fullbeartedly comply with our instructions if §' assooiation

with the KGB (sic) continues after the departure of LOG wo would probably
be willing to continue our relationshir with S only if we were able to
count on his eineerety and complete complying with every inetruction he
‘peceive from us. § atated that itwee clear to him thet he could

pay
if he got himself in trouble by acting

not count om any help. fron ue
on hie own . F left it at that.
ll. Ae the working part of the meet ended about 1040 hre 9 stated
that he wea broke and did not anticipate to be ina petter financial
condition for two additional monthe. & turned this theme one way and the
other untsi he came out with the requort for abouts
that he would look into the matter and we left the Thy Le Olud and
started walking. 8,@ne obviourly fearing thet tho meet would wrhk up
“and he’ would go home without any acney, apAB complained that the place
( the INf) wae good for writing purposes. but the food wae louay (true)
and no‘drinks were served and that if he wag not broke he would hed
invited P to a brandy. P reacted by offoring a brandy. Oree at the bar

lation of about 20 pages of Russian text into to Spanish ard that he

was sent by LOG and he asked him who waa the pereon. LOG stated thet he
did not know. the person and aince it wae a matter of translation he (L0G)
sent him to L-1 hoping that he may earn some money by making the translation
I~l asked LOG did he know that RAMOS epoke come Rusedan which he leerned
at the IIORM. LOG stated that he wes not aware of that fact. L-1 will
make the traslation if he oan handle the terminoxogy dealing with economy.

5. Inl told LCG that he spoke to ¥, YUNOZ about the Sov fils and
that MUNOZ wae pleased with the offer. Due to the fact that UNOS ie
presently undergoing @ treatment he was not able to make arrangementa
for showing of the film. In reply to LOG's question I-] stated that
HUNOZ wanted to show the film in the Communist Party Centro (gio) at
eveasraen



-2- ATTAGNENT 2 1

Versailles, L0G exclaimed that for Meavens sake he did not anything like
that; he wanted this to be entirely on private and personal besie without
political elements involved; to show the film at Vereailles would be
stupid, it would just enable the imperialists to blast in the papers
that the Sova were getting involved in internal political matters of
Mexicoy in view of the coming Presidential elections this could bé blown
up into @ ecandal..L-l remarked that he saw no difference in showing the
film in the OPCentro or in the Centro Asturiano ae LOG wented originally.

LOG explained at length the difference and IL-1 promised to have another

talk with NUNOZ. 7 ;
6." IL-l told that LOG: that quite recently he saw in the prees some
thing written to the effeot that there ere presently in the USSR 4 types
of detention ( concentration ) camps end he wondered whether that wae
an indication that the freedom in the USSR wae being trimmed again. LOG
etated that "this was pure imperialist propaganda". He went on tu say
that in the USSR the cefea are full of people and that one can hear them
even oritisiging the government. He added that in hie opinion there is
too such. {demasiado mucho) freedon in the USSR and other Socialist countries!
If Stalin was alive it could not happen that while the people in America
ere openly protesting egainst the war in Vietnam and against imperialien
@ Socialist country as Ozecho rizes its people in favor of American and
West Gernam empirjalion. "Too mich freedom in the USSR results with still
more freedom in other Socialist countries; this is no longer freedom, it
ie a shameful detraial of Socialism; I hope that it will ve realised soon
that Stalin wee right", eaid Lod.

Te At thie point LOG worked in a hint to I~1 that he should do
something for the Socialist cause. IL-1 sounded his old tune saying that
he eaw nothing he could do snd added that now when LOC opened him the
door to the American Intelligence Service through Viotor RAKOS (actually
working for She Zconomist Inteliigence Unit, S.A., Reforma 116 - 801 B)

- he would find out vould they pay him well and if they would he would

work for them, becaurs anyway the Sove never gave him anything. When LOG

i

, asked him what the hell he was speaking about, lel stated thet he vas

&m joking and LOG eormented that I~l1 hed never done anything to help

the Sov effort and consequently, they were not able to pay him anything.

Keet with LOGINOV (P11,712¥on July 16 at SrPe-Paris

1. The meet was prearranged and it lasted about two hours. The pre#:
viously used procedure wae followed: S and LOG met in front of the ree
etaurant and they entered it together. As usually, LOG wae sharp in ap-
pearing at on the spot.

TEZIR HEXT MEET: On Aug 4 at Samborns Insurgentes-Tarquena at

2000 bre.
2. Qourse of the eet. =

LOG asked § why he did not come "to play tennis with bim” at
the Franch Olut on July 12. 8 explained that he was not. feeling well
and that he did not recover completely from the flu which he had ell
week, 5 added that. only for the reason of keeping the word given to a
friend (L0G) he came to this meet. Nice words by LOG who concluded that
he brought 8 2 bottles of Votka which can be used ae " a medioine” for
colde and similar disconforte.
3. As 1t could be expected after such an opening of the meet LOG
wae interested was 8 able to accomplish something for him. 8 told him that
he had done what he promised snd gave LOG the written report which L0G
read. When he finished the redding LOG remarked that 8 did not eign the
report, When 8 said that he was willing to do it right there, 100 eaid
that. it wae not necessary and that he was only joking.
be LOG spent considerable amount of time in questioning 8 ebout
the reasone, consequences whick the cancellation of PEMEX contract(e)
with eome US 012 companies. At sertain. point the questions lecked clarity
and 8 asked LOG poiat blane what wae he driving at. LOo stated that &
should reolize that the USSR is the second largest producor of oii in |
the world (#10) and that he wae interested in finding out wan it possible
for the USER to step in where the Asoricane kicked out (aic). S told LOG |
that it wae diffioult to go gore erong than LOG woo in hie thinking,

$e LOG commented that the USSR wae very much interested in ete
ing strong economic interchange, especially trade, with Mexico a ‘were
not finding the right atmosprere ner proper respouse in Mexico. He asked

8 what, in hie opinion,. eould or should be done to overcome thie situation.
8S anewered that ne bolteved that the Sovs ought to change their mentality i
if they wented to trade with Xexico, naimly, in the field of trade they
should forget about Socialism and adapt the Capitalistic mentality: to
trade with Mexico S0vs would have to establish industrial plante here

and to do it Mexicene must have 51 per cent ohare in each case, which
meane the controling atook; in reality this does not mean that Nexicans
would invest 51 perGent of the value....cere

6. L0G went to the other item of the written report and he ssked

8 how he went about in contacting Ohin-Heien TANG, counselor of the

Nat Chinese Bab. 6 told him about posing ae @ reporter for the sagazine

La Kieion and going there on reccommendation of Pierre RUDIAN ( See
FERNALD's previous contact report). 8 edded that in the Sept iseue of the
magazine there would be an article desling with Nat China and the

Peiking © Moecow coflict and if needed another artciole on Ohing-Kai Shek
would be published. L0G told S that he was pleased with the manner in
whigh 8 handled the task he gave him. LOG did not disouss the contents

of this part of S's report and he questioned § about CHTANG: he wanted

to know was 8 in @ position to keep this scquaintance alive and develop

it in to @ sort of friendly inforwal.relationship; he (L0G) knew TANG from
some formal diplomatie gatherings and he liked the person. 8 believed that
he wae able to keep alive the established acquaintance and was not able

to guese as to bew far te would be able to develop it. LOG suggested

that 6 do not allow too mich time to pace until his next vieit to TAN.

8 said that he eculd call an TANG on Pri July 25 to explain him that

he 4i@ net succeed in getting the article in the Aug issue of the magazine
and will publish it in Bept issue; at the same time S will make it known
that ho wee interested in gotting the matosial for an article on Ohiang-kai
fhesk which should keep the doors open for another vieit.... § was in

_ eacb other. LOG stated that he knew RUDIAK well and was in may instances

“Se

to bring his relationship with TANG to a point that L0G could meet TASG
ine friendly unofficial manner. LOG concluded that for such a job he
was willing to pay 8 in terme of thourands of Dollars, After the dust
of verbage sattled LOG..told 8 that he should try to feel cut TANG was
he willing to speak about the military stregth of Red Ohina. LOG ex~
Plained to S that presently the Sova were completely in dark as to the
nllitery strength and operational organisation of the Red Chinese army;
they have no way of acquiring the info because even if they had friende
in Red Ohina none of them dared to maintain contact with Sov officials
nor offioials of other Socialist countries which are known to be on the
Sov side; Net Ohina has many spies in Red Ohina and they are woll infced
on all aspects of developments in Red Ohina: it ie poseible that TANG
would be willing to make arrangemente with hie government for exchange
of info, especially, military info between the USSR and the ep. of Ohina
and this would be beneficiary to the USSR and the USA. LOG went on to
tell 6 that he should think in terme of using RUDIAN for getting to
meet TANG out of hie embassy: be that a party or whatever might be |
needed, the expenses will taken care of by LOG, because money is noi
problem.

Tr. Then, LOG stated that § should arrange something to enable LOG
to meet RUDIAN in a emall, family type, circle. 8 wae cought by surprise
and told L6G that he told him that he and RUDIAN were quite often seeing

with RUDIAN et Teoeptione and other formal social functions, but he er
had an oportunity to be with RUDIAN in friendly and unforms1 circumstances.
8 commented that the only problem he found. in trying to make such an:
arrangement was in the fact that RUDIAN often, sometime even twice in a
week, drops in to eeé 8 at his (Josephine's) apt but he never announces

hie vieite in advance more. than an hour or two before he comes. i i

8. 10G asked & what happened to the US Eb phone directory; ‘asa the.
girl (friend of S) return, 8 anewored that he did not have the slightest
idea what was going on, "because in his condition (of health) he did joven |
go to check dia the girl return",

9. LOG wae proposing that they meet in the course of the next week
bus S told hia that he felt that they were nesting too often and in view



‘| will limit their. regular peraonal meets to twice per conth. He went on

- whe

of his atatus of a tourist it may be asseumbed that the Gobernacion carry
out epot checks on him; if he was to be eeen by the Sebernacion or Security
agente in company of LOG it is prety certain that they would take hia
-——in-and ioterrogate him; he thinke that this can be avoided if they do not |
see each other so often. | :
10. LOG agreed with S' reasoning and added that he himself realised
“that they were getting together too often and he aleo cannot be 100 per
cent sure that he is not tailed come-tine. Therefore, he will out a plan
by which they will be able to see each other whenever 1¢ is needed and

| to tell $ that he would pick up an aprepriate spot on which 8 will place
". @ chalk eign when he needs to se LOG urgently; LOG will paes by the place
H every morning and if he see the sign he will erase it which will assure

{ § that he und retood his request and they would then meet the same evening
at a place (restaurant) which they would select only for this purpose.

&0G concluded by stating that this wae the general idea and that he would
work out the details which he will explain to 8 on their next meat which
they would hold in two weeke, i.e. August 4. :

nh. $3 commented that.the plan looked good and if LOG was sure that
it would work then there was no need for them to meet more than one a
month. LOG stated that 2 meets per month were needed in spite of the
fact that he was positive that his system was dependable. :

12. § told LOG that he did not spend any of tha MH 400.— he gave
bim for the purpose of establishing contact with an officiel of the
Bat Ohinese Bmb end consequently wanted to return the money. LOG told
him to keep it for himself and that hw would give him money, ae much ae
needed, if he had an oportunity to entertain TANG.

“13. There was some pnconsequential talk and LOG told 8 to cose
H to the Prench Olub any Saturday and that he would teach him to play
| tennis. LOG expleined that he wae going to the club every Saturday |
about 1000 hret 5 will be allowed to enter if he says that LOG was
waiting for hin. ‘

unimportant, He said this daily resume which he sends home

by Telex takes him about two or three hours. He said he is i

separate from the Embassy and prefers it that way. SARATOV

claimed to have traveled around Mexico quite a bit. He seemed

visited the Yucatan since being stationed here, but that, as

a tourist, he had seen the ruins there some years ago. SARATOV Bee

said that he is from Siberia, and in answer to a

SUBJECT Relationship Between AEDIENARD end Gloria PINTO

1, _In response to « conversation between Chief, SB, and the under-
‘signed, LIREALM-1 was questioned intietatl on, 25 Septecber concerning
the relationship which exixts between AEDIZHARD and Gloria PINTO with @
view toward possible embarrassment of AEDIEHARD before his superiors,

-2,  LIREALM*1 atid his wife both believe (but have no proof) that
~.it-is probable that Glorta PINTO is having or has had an affair with
AEDIERARD, Both LIREALM and his wife are close friends of the PINTO's
snd know that Gloria {# strongly attracted to AEDIEHARD whe {3 both
physically and intellectually superior to her busband, fue to Gloria's
continued friendship vith AEDIEHARD at the French Club and other placés,
LIREALM=1 feels sure that Gloria's susband, Pepe, does not yet know of

the dffeir. 7

3. _LIRBALM=1 characterized Pepe PINTO as; avect, slow-witted and : i

below average in intelligence, ‘He is a physician specializing in lung dis-

orders,’ bora in the Canary Islands, He considers himself a Spaniard with

the @haracteristic spanish lack of respect for women, He attempts to

tigutiy control Gloria's activities while, according to Gloria, having

aa many affairs himself as he cau, Gloria gseatly resents Pépe's attitude
- toward her, Pepe is basically defensive and vould.not vant anyone to knov

if Gloria were having.an effair vith another man, He vould probably deny

it 4£ anyona said so, even if he were aware of it, Re wculd take it out on

Gloria, however, and would probably beat her and restrict her movensate even

more closely,

«4a In view of the aboves it would certainly appear that there would be
nothing to gain, and perhaps such to logse, by any attempt at exposing her
supposed affair with ABDIKHASD. Since she now appears to be {a contact with

is more to this invitation than meets the eye and that the KGB will |

be going all out to recruit him, I think Subject may be right and
I think ho should probably find a good excuse for not going.

Subject states that ho had complained to KAZANTSEV (P-880) about
the shoddy treatment he had been getting from LOGINOV (P-11,712),
Never before had hg beon forced to "stand in line’ for Soviet visas !
for his clients, In the pxst, he had boen able to sent passports
to the Soviet Embassy any day--nevoer mind the office hours--and get
the passports back with yisa the samo day... Subject, says that Ech Dawes

been uncooperative (meaning that he had refused to let LOGINOV :
recruit him), Subject. says. unequivocally that LOGINOV is leaving
PCS by tho end of October and that jhe is not being replaced by a
newcomer, Subject WnderStands thatNECHIPORINKO, who in a former tour
bad worked in the Consular Section, will take over as Chief of the

Consular Section when LOGINOV leaves, :
i

Subject says that KAZANTSEV is about to leave (in fact, Subject
thought KAZANTSEV had already loft} and that both a replacement for
hin and a@ now ambassador were on the way, I told Subject that as
far as I knew, KAZANTSEV was to be replaged by another concierge Come pee
who would be Charge, but Subject insisted that an ambassador had
bean named and would be coming soon, He did not know who the

ambassador would be,

Nw Foes
Subject remarked that both IVANOV and -NINITOSOY hind left and he
said that NIITOROY was, he thought, a very decent person,

Subject said that PRIKHODXO (P-2270) had come to see him to say
goodbye. PRIKHODKO had said, almost with tears in his oyes, that
Subject had been a very good friend and that he tould never forget
him. Ho invited Subject and wife to cone visit hin in Moscow,

Then when Subject asked PRIKUCDXO for address, PRIKHODKO herned

and hawed and said that ho dida’t really have an address yet but

nent of

the Ministry of Forefen Affairs, Subject recarked that PRIKHCDXO

was undoubtedly boing Sincere, but when you cane right dow to it,
he wag just am henned in and afraid as anything of the others,
Subfect said that 4t vas a real tragedy that the Soviet aysten

made such robots out of good powple,

Memorandum . isbestenbssuastese
TO: RIZZUTO through ARCHBOL!

From: FERNALD

Subject: ABDIEHARD (P211,712) * Thoughts Ro poesibility of Pitching His

1 Assuming it was agreed thet A should be pitnched before his POS
| departure, because there are no indications that he would be more suacept=
i ible asker to an approach~later. when he comes to a new post abroad in few

* yeare and, to the contrary, it ie more likely thet he would be still more
5 : daring, more selfconfident and more determined to advance ané solidify

hie position within the KGB, I wish to add some views of mine to the list

of possibilities aa to how a pitch could be carried out.
| 2. My views and thoughts on this subject will be based on the postible
| use of existing assets and means. I am fully aware that there will be
: plenty of room for improvements, additione and modifications of what will
pe said in the following peras.
Be As far as I know we are lacking adequately solid facts in which
we could put our teeth, i.e. we do not wocatecnos posses worthwhile mention-

ing materiel which we could use to exert a desired pressure on A.

i he I am inclined to believe thet we are ina position to make 4
i serious attempt to obtain a "pressure argument" through the use of existing
agsete which are targeted against A and that it can be done without taking

. sn undue risk,

i

os 5. Ae a nove in this direction I wae thinking in terns of having
« recorded a meet for which we would prepare To be more
specific I have in mind a situation along the following 1inas:



370

;
g

de should go to such a meet with experession of
a person who ie in exceptionally good mood, because
of a bugineas success and he wae given a subetantial
advence on his commission: After A and have
their routine two drinks, will state to A that
he would piok up the tab for the evening ( after being
treated by A so many times ) but he would want to
celebrate the occasion. It would be desirable that A
agrees. on 6 drink or two to please S, but even if that
does not take place, it ie enticipated that A would
want to accompany S£ ih hie good humors. What ever
ve the case, the situation lends itself to a free
talking, eritioal gommenting and some bitching, juét
tu play it big. Jt will bé up to us. to prepare S as
to how to run the cenvereation to get out of A a few
statements which he would not like hie superiors to
know abouts

ad.

€ may requert e meet with A under tho pretext that
that the people interested in the platinum doal sont
to € their specialist, who would like to clear sone


“37

-~3-
questions before opening the Jetter of dredit and that
it. war essential that the person who arrived here see
A, because that will strangthen S' position in the deal.
I mentioned the. platinum deal because it would give
some common ground to the Hew person being introduced
- on the scene, but some other story might be ae good.

e. The new person showing up under the platinum deal
or any other pretext would be a case officer of ours.

a Russian language speaker. I am inclined to believe

problem for the case officer to start speaking Russian.

3. If he had teen looking for me, it could be
that he has been asked to step in where val failed.
That is, as an American friend, I never invéted val
: to my home. He never met other Americans through
: ma. Note, however, that he never invited me to his
+ home either-=though he did invite us frequently to

various evonts which were under the auspices of the
Soviet embassy. We did net but rarely accept, One
such-occasion was the Moscow circus. H

4. If he had been looking for me, it could be
that he wants to assure his acceptance by our tennis
group where Gloria Finto isa possible target. Oleg
has gotten to Gloria, but I, the American who is
somewhat and Sometimes hostile to soviets, might, be
considered a stumbling block. Perhaps he, Oleg, will
> . try to reach all the other members of the group in-
dividually so that an invitation by Gloria to one of ‘
our functions will meet with general acccptances

SCENARIO OF CONTACT
Y arrived about 0300 and took an instructor, ,

About 0950 Oleg arrived to play with and in-
structor on the adjoining court. He made no effort to
grect me. He had been pointed out to me by val, but
ec I had not been pointed out to him do my knowledge=~

: though it is certain that Oleg and jval must have
discussed the "players" in thoir"game" and counted ,
me as possibly on the other team, That is, I am sure~
that Val has pointed. me out to Oleg, but Oleg would
not have wanted to acknowledge this.

EE ee a‘ At 1000 my hour was up and I told my instructor
7 I was through--I did not want to continue for another
hour. As I was paying my instructor T noticed that
Oleg was paying his, It is very unusual and possibly
even had form to take an instructor for less than
hhalf-an-hour. I am suggesting that he wanted to be
free to contrive an accidental meeting with mee

g I set a course for one of the several gates
. . from the courts we vere using, I could see that Oleg
had headed for the sama gate (this could have been
perfectly natural) and at a speed Which after some
thirty yards would bring him to the gate at the same
moment as I (this was not entirely natural).

Since I had an excuse to greet him, having had
him pointed out in front of Pepe Pinto the preceding
: week, I did so. I Rukx2 said Good Morning and asked
if Kal were hore. He looked very pleased (I kthoughe
possibly relieved) when I took the initiative and

recognized hime

Oleg said that Val had not. arrived ts far as -
he know, I said I had been training to get ready for
val. I waited my revenge for last weeXs

Oleg seemed amused: by this and immediately asked
4£ I would like to play with him since Val was not
here. I agreed. We found @ court and played for about

ona hour. Olgg won 6-3, 6-4.

Oleg is very athletic in appearance and played
and excellent game for someone who has played for
only two years (if this is true). He has enormous
muscular thighs. It escapes mo what sport would
produce this, other than weightiiftings Weightlifting
4s out Since his upper torso, though muscular, is far
less develop

likely to produce his particular kind of developments

Oleg is pleasant. Speaks excellent Spanish. Has
not mado any political comments (yet!). Seems more
intelligent, but less extroverted than Val.

Oleg asked if I were with the Aworican Bubassys
I answered"no, I have my own business", It was then
that he asked if I. knoew another "Bill® who is in
private business aa who £3 has an army rank. Oleg
shui loasejoxs thought the other person was a major.”

I left at this point. Oleg stayed on to play

SUBJECT; Recent and Proposed Contact Between LIREALM"1 and AEDIEWARD

‘LEBEALM™. re) poe '

i fev ¢

| a. LIREALM+1, following Seation advice tekdacing the the recent | MS

imeident where AEDIEHARD approached LIREALM=1 with an offer to pay LIREAHM-l Shee

for any information he could obtain from the U.S. Embassy, has avoided AoW yeh

contact with AEDIEHARD at the French Club, LIREALM-1's wife, ac almost ‘/%,

daily visitor to the Club, has been asked by LIREALM“L to note AEDIEHARD's we, wy

activities and associates and report anything interesting to LIREALM-1. fa f we i
Ab J

b. Mrs. LIREALM recently told LIREALM-1 that for a number of Mon Caan)
[consecutive Saturdays; AEDIEHARD hed brought a young lady, whom MRs LIREZALM ra
thinks co be Getsan, to the Club ae his guest. Mrs. LIRSALM did not attempt

to determine the identity of the femele, but reported the information to

her husband, She has noted no other items of interest in AEDIEHARD's

pattern ef ettivities at the Club. He has not seemed to single out any we

individual as a tennis partner, nor ia be frequently seen socializing vith Ww

anyone in particular while at the Club. ay ie ba

_ 2. LEREALMs1 vas advised that the Station had learned that, AEDIEHARD \'Y") co’ 74
will not return to MIHARSH iumediategy as originally thought, but tie will wie
‘probably remain in Mexico for another five-months. LIREALN*1 was told that

thie information was-.dot yet public knowledge, but the Station would like

LIREALM=1 to confirm this if possible, This led to a general discussion of :
LIREALM*1's, association with AEDIEHARD since the recent incident, LIREALM-1

was instructed that it was not the Station's wish that he avoid contact with
AEDIEHARD, but rather that he oot single out AEDIEHARD for special attention

or closely court his friendship. It i the writer's opinion that a euffictent

time has elepsed. since the last incident for LIREALM-1 to again renew some
associstion with AEDIEHARD, and a particiilerly opportune chance to do so is
available: LIREALM-1 end AEDIEHARD both belong (as has previousiy been reported)
to a group of teanis enthystests at the Club who take turns entertaining each

other in their howes, To date, all the members of this group hawe given parties
except LIREALM-1. dre. LIREALM, following theincident and thinking that AEDIEHARD
was soon to depart, has stated that she lid mot want to have AZDIERARD in her

hoae since he repregents a governsent 00 opposed to the principles of her govern~
ment, etc. Based oa AEDIFRARD's extension in Mexico and the fact that the LIREALM's
owe their frtonds a party, LIREALM was inetructed to plan a party for the group

‘and to include AEDIERARD and his vife {n the group invited, At the party,

LIREALM-12 should sot focus an undue acount of attention on AEDIENARD, but should
take advantage of the opportunity to renew their goneral friendshiy and let the
matter, sore or less, take its own head from there. Ae a firet step in this
general direction, LIREALH"1 plans to xo to the Club over the weekénd of 6-7

3. A second reason why hoth LIREAMN-1 and his wife plan to go to the
Club 4s to see if they can identify the new "girl-friend” of AEDIEHARD.

this pretext, he vill try and take a picture of the girl friend Lf the oppor- ra
tunity presents itself where i€ will not come to the attention of AEDIEHARD.

1. As requested in Reference, Station queried INBREED as to
why they had included Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-0285412}
in their list of Soviets who had been PNG'd or expelled from
various countries in the past five years. :

2. In INBREED's reply to our query, they stated that in the
periodic "Das Beste" there was an extract from the Reader's Digest
of 1 January 1972, of h boolatitled "Moscow's Attack on Mexico" by
John Barron, From this article it was learned that the KGB cfficer

. LOGINOV met secretly with Mexican students at the time of the
student demonstrations in Mexico in 1968; In March 1971, when
five Soviet officials were PNG'd from Mexico, it was believed that
Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV was among those ousted.

i

3. Upon learning that LOGINOV served in the Soviet Embassy

im Mexico City as Third Secretary/Vice Counsel from August 1965
to October 1969, INBREED has now advised the Station that LOGINOV's
name ama crroneously appeared in their list of Soviets who had

that he usually left his seat ebout 2309 hours and went out to the lobby
for gone: tine. She did not knov vhere the contests were setually made.
Once she and LOGINOV encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the
Cine Mod theater, a Mexican Aruy Colonel, who was introduced to her by i
LOCINGV as “Col. Sergio." In this instonce LCGINOY did not excuse hinself

to have @ private conversation with’ the Mexican. "Col. Sergio" was de-

Sergio" appeared to be about 25 years old end vas introduced as his wife

(«hich AEMIURIFF doubted tecouse, es she put it, he didn't treat her as

one would a wife, but rather as a cistress). AEMIDRIFF knew nothing tore

about this Mexican and never sew hin again.

Oa another occasion, LOGINGY and AEMIDRIFF met an Anerican in

they had in the police here. She said she had also overheard KoLexyaxov,
EAKULIN, AND CESYKHOY telx etout how many good police contacts the Soviets

AEAIDRIFF could give concerned ,

have. However, eech spe

when the Soviets vented te get sonething through Aduana; when some Soviet

vas missing ond police cooperation was needed; getting edvance notice when ie
sone deconstration hostile’ to the Soviets was about to take place, ete.

She was not able to recall eny hints that Soviets had operational contacts

in the polices agents rezerting on vhat the police were doing; assets vho

assisted’ Soviets operatinzally in sexe way. However, ADMIDRIFF thought

the Sovicts ‘protebly have such essets.

of any of the Mexicans she met on these occasions, and of course there is

Subject : LIBACON-1 i
Poriod Covered: January 30 to August 14, 1969

30 and was handled by him until March 26, During this period

- they held nine ops meetings.

3. After a fine recruitment jot KARTSUX also accomplisi 2d te
difticult task of converting LIBACON~-!'s agreement to wore foe
KARTASUK personally “into a regular working arrangement.

a. Of the nine meetings KARTASUK held with LIBACON-1,
actually only six were working meetings, Info was obtained on
LIBACON=1'S personal background as well as his ops potential,

LIBACON-1 was SGSWIRLED with satisfactory results. Further, :
for us and he was mentally prepared

to accept another handler, During this period the condition which
LIBACON-1 had placed on his agreement to work for us was respected
(ive., that he would not be asked to report on his personal friends
ech ag Syeniards, his students, or Nexicans. to whom he ‘wis
tionally vttached), LIBACON-1 did complete for KANTASLK.a
15-line wr'tten report on AED IEHARD, .

5, FERNALD encountered no problems in getting along with a:d
handling LIBACON-1, whom he got accustomed to following instruct.ons

and to sybmitting reports in writing.

6G, LIBACON-1's initial attitude was that he
or more accurately, to.assist us in our work against AEKICK, but he
was deternined to keep hinself away frem everybody and everything
associated with AEKICK, Pe dtd net seo AEDIEHARD for ‘avre than

7. FERNALD succeeded in convincing LIBACON=1 that he should
Maintain social or friendly personal contact with AFDIENARD ‘and his.
Solléagues and that he could do it without either giving in to his

’ Or their demands, or at the.other extreme, without saying no to

everything they vention or ask for. LIBACON~1 followed instructions
and went to AFDIEVARD's office to ask him why he had not. called

him for ten wecac, he result was that LIBACOX-1 had two luncheon
meetings with ALDIEHARD in July, and on August 8 LIBACON=1 and his
wife were dinner guests of AEDIEHARD and his wife at their apartment,
The -AEDIEHARDS agreed to come to LIBACON~L's place for a farewell

‘dinner in September and ia the meanwhile LIBACON-1 and AEDIEHARD

will meet,for a luncheon on August 29,

8. FERNALD insisted from tho beginning of his handling of
LIBACON=1 that the latter prepare bio sketches on the MHHARSHers
he know personally and on Spanjards who had lived in the USSR.
LIBACON-1 prepared bio sketches, which are actually personality
assessuents, on AEDIEHARD, IDENTITY A, IDENTITY B, IDENTITY C, and
IDENTITY D. The latter two reports showed that he would also report
on two Spaniards who are close friends of his, ia spite of his
earlier con ivas, Further, FERNALD instructed LIBACON-1 to contact
® good friend of his (IDENTITY E) when the lsrte: returned from a
longer trip to Czechoslovakia, LIBACON~1 carvied out the assignnent
well and reported (orally) about IDSNTITY S's observations, impressions
and conclusions concerning What he sev aw? heard curing his stry it.
bis country, IDENTITY FE is also 2 good personal friend ot LIBACON-?.

>. From the aboye it can be seen that LIBACON-1 has developoa
inte 4 person who has confidence in us, and. he bauaeechad without
reservation that we know what we are doing. i:

10, In analyzing. LIBACON-1's written reports it can easily
be soen that LIBACON-1 takes his assignneats seriously and when he
makes a statement about 2a person he is scrupulous about drawing
enly ‘that conclusion which can be corroborated with facts. UIBACCN=1
it equally rious and reliable. when he reports about his nestirge |
ast AEDIEM ‘D: He first. reports the course of the aeetiig and
reports AELJCIARD's statements..verbatim, as much as pissibly, Then,
he uses b*~ srea knowledge and the knowledge of the person to relay,
the act.al meaning of the statements, FERNALD not only believes.
that LIBACON-L's reporting. is reliable, but he also feels that ore
can deperd or, LIBACON-1 to use his knowledge of the area and people
to sepa.a.e the appearance and verbiage from the facts, be they

good cr vid.

ae An assessment of the moral and political reliability of
LIBACON-1, from the point cf view of his work and activity on our
hehal?.can only be favorable, Thy same cannot be said when ore
views his p.recsal life. In this field ho has many problems, which,
goverisiv cyenying, are a result cy the fact that while he is
intellectually mature (or at leas. adequately mature for bia age),

SECRET



PSs

whon 1t comes to emotions he acts like a teon-ager, LIBACON~1
4s aware of this fact and he ascribes it to the fact that he grew
under conditions of regimentation and moral terror; and when he
* found himself in a world in which people live free and there are
no restrictions on personal activities, as long ar they do not
violate the laws of the country, he remained prsscssed by the desire
to enjoy this freedom, Fortunately, hi:. personal immaturity 7 ;
affects his work for us only to the extent that he occasionally t
-may. not complete an assessuent;, but when he does do a job he does. A
.,, it very well, : if
12, To conclude: Although LIBACON~1 has his picbisas!
there are restricted to the area. which docs not affect his reliability, ‘
at dependability and loyalty to us and our cause, It is felt that 1
LIBACON@-1. will be still more productive and easier developed when ce
handled by a case officer speaking Russian;i,e., the language of G +
his formative years,

WITH ACHIEVING OBJECTIVE NUMBER ONE: PROTECTING AND MAINTAINING
