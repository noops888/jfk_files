that you had in mind.was not that Maurice Bishop?

Mr. Goldsmich. Getting back to Mr. Bishop, when was the

first time you saw him to the best of your memory?

I would think about the early Sixties.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were you ever formally introduced to him?

Mr. Eiderigo No.

Mx. Goldsmith. And from the time that you first saw him

in the early Sixties until the last time that you saw him,:

which I believe you said would have been about 1969 or 1970,

approximately how many tines did you actually see this man?

Mr. Hidalgo! It would not have been that late because ir.

late 1964 or early 1965 I left the Cuban operations and went t

another country of interest, so in those times, say 1950 to

1964, it might have been two or three times.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it fair to say in light of your last

comment that once you stopped working in Cuban operations, you

left that particular area, you no longer saw Mt. Bishop?

Mr. Elidaigo It I did, it would be just in the hallway

and I don't think so. I was now in another pait of the agency

but I don't know that.

Mr. Goldsmich. Is it possible that the name Maurice

Biship may have been an alias?

Mr. [lidalgo] Very possible.

Mx. Goldsmith. Why do you say that?

Mr. Hidalgo] Because others in the agency thought chat

they knew me by X name and they called me by that name when in

fact it was not.

Mr. Goldsmith. So the use of aliases even at agency

headquarters was not at all uncommon, is that true, to your

Knowledge?

Mr. Goldsmith.. At this time I would like to show you an

exhibit, I believe it is JrK Exhibit No: 104, and I vould like

to ask you. to examine that and to tell the committee whether s

recognize that individual.

Mr.

• I don'i believe so, sir.

Mt. Goldsmith. Thank you. You can put that aside now.

Did you know an individual named Antonio Veciana Blanc?

Mr.

• Now this name sounds familiar to me in my

Cuban operation, I don't know where. It may have been with

literally hundreds - hundreds - of tie Cubans.

MI. Goldsmith. Did Mr. Bishop have any involvement in t

affairs of the brigade? By brigade I am not referring to the

Bay of pigs operation.

MI.

I don't know if he did.: I was not aware

evexyone. He might very well have been involved in this thin:

Mr. Goldsmith. Getting back to Mt. Bishop, when was the

first time you saw him to the best of your memory?

Mr.

I would think about the early Sixties.

Mr. Goldsmith. Were you ever formally introduced to him:

ME.

NO.

Mr. Goldsmith. And from the time that you firsc saw him

in the early Sixties until the last time that you saw him,

which I believe you said would have baen about 1969 ox 1970,

approximately how many times did you actually see this man?

Mr.

.. It would not have been that late because ir

Late 1964 or early 1965 I left the Cuban operations and want t

another country of interest, so in those times, say 1250 to

1964, it might have been two or three times.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it fair to say in light of your last

comnent that once you stopped working in Cuban operations, you

left that particular area, you no longer saw Mi. Bishop?

MI.

If I did, it would be just in the hallway

and I don't think so. I was now in another pait of the agency

during your stay at the agency on at loast two or thice occa-

sions you saw an individual whom you knew to be Maurice Bishop:

MI.

Whom someone told me, "That is Maurice

Bishop."

•. Mr. Goldsmith. Mx. Chairnan, I have no further questions

at this time. I may have a few, follow-up questions. If the

cormittee has questions, I will yield at this time.

MI. Preyer. All right.

Mt. Fithian.

Mr. Fithian. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Do you get any feel for whether other people that you get

to see just casually at the CIA are - I don't know how to put

this -- higher or lower on the pecking order?

Mt.

Pardon?

• Mx. Fithian. Do you have a feel for an individual that

you see casually over at the agency as to whether or not they

are higher up in the structure?

MI.

A feeling? =

Mr. Fithian. Xes.

You mean when I was working at the agency

Yes, I think i know what you are trying to

I would say he was a higher grade than I wa

MI:

Of course I was not a very high grade.

Mr. rithian. That is the only question I had, Mt. Chair-

inars.

Mr. Preyer. Was your office in tangley in the CIA head-

quarters?

MI.

• Yes. At the time I was in headquarters.

That is where I went.

MI. Preyer. And Dave Phillips' office was also there?

yes, six.

And i: Maurice Bishop's office was not on

the same floor as yours in langley?

Mt.

I don't know.

It was a very large floor

and there were many people on the floor that had nothing to

do with what I had to do.

Mr. Pteyer. Did Bishop have some relationship in his

appearance and age to Phillips?

MI.

Again I cannot recall Bishop's appearance

at all.

Mr. Preyer. Do you recall more on the name when people

said, "That is Maurice Bishop"?

Mk. Goldsmith.

I have a few more questions for you, Me.

Do you know whether David Phillips Knew Maurica Bisho

I don'" know that. He may have known h

Mx.-

but I don't know that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Is it possible that the nana Maurice

Biship may have been an alias?

MI.

Very possible.

Mx. Goldsmith. Why do you say that?

• Because others in the agency thought th

they knew me by X name and they called me by that name whe

fact it was not.

Mr. Goldsmith. So the use af aliases even at agency

headquarters was not at all unconnon, is that true, to you

knowledge?

Mx.

That is true.
