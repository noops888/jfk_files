SECRET-EYES ONLY.

Kennedy,

March 12, 1964

Mad-

I must say I think Ferguson is right, and

far better from standpoint US-Moroccan

relations just to let matter crift away. Am 1

correct in deducing that main reason Mrs. Kennedy

wants publicity is because King seportedly took

this villa away from somebody to give lo her.

If this in case, King will no doubt and some

other way to avoid returning villa.

Mra. Kennedy le also protected because

if house matter ever becomes public again, she

has of cousse already declined it.

It you agres, I'd ltise to clue Rabat

SOOneSt, tO poor Fergle doesa's give word to

press before we reprieve him.
