Re requirements in DIRA75OS, L-9 reperted as

follows:
In asmuch as Ranon SINOBAS Casado, Cuban First Sec,

handles all matters with Foreign Office, ip difficult for him get’ any

one thing was clear and that the fact that the Mexican Government was
confiscating propaganda at the airport, In additim, he said thst: on

3 aug at the airport ,. Salavador DE LA TORRE Callejas, Cuban professor,
showed him a letter which was signed by Raul ROA and addressed to the
Mexican Arb in Brazil requesting that DS LA TORRE begiven a Mex‘can
visa. The Mexican Amb refused to honor RAS request and DE lA TORRE
came, into Mexico without a visa, DE LA TORRE was furlous, of course,

but I-9 was abdke to arrange his departure for Havana Without ary ceeuee
-L-9 said that about 8 menths ago Pres, LOPEZ Mateos told Elvira VARGAS, |

aN this, Lg added that the Embassy officials believe that LOPEZ is ©

they talked about a possible defection inhis mse. 9 delieves that

he was recalled because.of this mistrust.

Tuesday,d did not have the other requirements in mind and so I had to
leave them until another time. ,

L.9 provided fol info re Cuban Embassy dips and con~

that the U.S, should not overlook this mm, a friend of his. It is L-9's
opinion that although AZCUE an extreme leftist he is not sympathetic,
7 at least ostensibly, with the Soviet cause, L-9 said that recently

AZCUE defended tha U,8, position MKKK in a d&scussion with Ana Maria

BLANCO, Ambassadérial gecretary. L-9 ad d that AZCUE 1s a very intell-

L.9 said that BLANCO brags about being a member of

Antonio MELLA group in Cuba, He considews her an out and out Gommunist,

When queried re security precaubicns in tne “mbassy, L-9 satd that ro-
cently BLANCO told him that the Xa#M ribbon in her new electric type-
witter was made of paper and that it was necessary because the printing
30682 remaing on the ribbon and this would be serious ‘seourlty problem,

L-9 does not know BOCANESRA but by description XXKXIS given the per-

tact with LITAIN-2 and AMSTET-1 - Bota mn suspect her of being 2)

BOCANEGRA is a Mexican,

nano INOBAS Casado ~ £9 dislikes SINCBAS intensely, He considera
him to be @ man with littd@a on the ball but trying his best to play

the big shot by "taking over” all important contatts { Foreign Office

Mexico aa the Charge 2 Diaihitves,. but. that Terdsa PROENZA told & LECHUGA

_o'when she heard this thiat she would leave the “mtaasy if DAVID cane to

take over. Charge Job, 9 believes ‘that LECHUGA listened to PROENZA

and fearing that he might lose her, decided to hold off on DAVID, L-9

XHAMIE XSEKX said that PROENZA is a good friend of Juan MARINELLO and

that XXXO00EX is is possible that PROENZA would leave Mexico to wonk

for him in Cuba, As roted preivously, L.9 respects PROENZA greatly

and feels that LECHUGA would bé making a mistake if he lets her get

aways
fob if anybody 18 to get it,

L-9 said that PROENZA believes that she should be given Chargo's

Le9 aaid that Maria ASO SOLO was at the Cuban Embassy on

—____—. .

the 26 of July- celebration.

L-9 gave me a copy of the book Antologia de los Novelistas

Cubanos on this date, At the previous mtg I told L.9 tiat £ would very

much like to have a copy of this book which I saw in his library, He |

said he would try and get me a copy, wnich he did, The book was pube

lished at the Imprenta Nacional in 1960, EXxXXXEXGX
I drove La9 to KXdt Avenida Avila Camacho, where he was
the

going to join the Bemily CUEVAS, fnu for dinner, He said that /CUEVAS

family, a very wealthy Mexican family, was very close to nim, in fact,

he said they are probably his best friends, It is believed that G¥se Luis

UEVAS, a leftist painter, 1s a MMi member of this family.
=~

ALthough I tried to get L-9 to make a future mtg date, he

refused saying he wanted to rest up after his latest ordeal, i.e. getting

list of Mexican supportHérs,

but he didn't even accept this. He

I suggested that be call me in about a week
