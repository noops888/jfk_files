CRC received request from Artime's prospective mother-in-law for back salary
due Artime for period of imprésonment. CRC records show that although Artiime MRR
delegate to FRD at approx $400/month untill few months before invasion during
which he in direct contact with CIA. Evidently Artime only member brigade for
whom no prior finan arrangements made. CRC proposes settle matter with payment
$3500 which equivalent basic brigade salary of $175 (martially illegéble)
for 20 months without allowance since Artime's parents not dependent. Artime
accepted $250 bonus frum CRC with considerable reluctance and told WAVE he prefers
decline back salary for political reasons.... To atoid criticism Artime not treated
fairly WAVE autbortizing CRC offer check for back salary but elso instructing
ARTIME decline on basis his acceptancd would create misunderstnadings. As equity
WAVE covert payments to Artime will be generous.

On Jan 22, writer met with Artime and Roberto Perez San Roman in Washington, D.C.
They were in D.C. to see the Attorney General and hopefully, Mr. Cottrell of
the State Dept. Both Artime and Preez stated that they regarded Robert Kennedy's
recent interviews with the press concenring the Bay of Pigs to be prompted by
internal U.S. political considerati ons. Both men, without solicitation, volunteered
the opinion that the Agency had suffered gravely for the Byy of Pigs, and they
stated that the Agency, in the persons of the Agency personnel whom they knew, was
not responsible for the failure. Artime stressed respect with which he viewed
the majority of Agency personnel with whom he had dealt.
...."From a long-range Agency viewpoint, it would appear that our interests nofw
are parallel, and he may be expected to wokr with us as long as they remain parallel."
