MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Bogelio CISNEROS

Subject was called at his Miami hone on 7 Hay 1965,

by the undersigned using the alias Albert Antonelli.

CISNEROS had attempted to contact his former case officer.

Alfonso Rodriguez, the day before, but failed.

Briefly, for the readers

not familiar with bis

name ,

Rogelio CISNEROS was a

former leader in the Junta

Revolucionaria (June), organized and directed by Manuel

RAY Rivero.

1964, in difference to RAY'S

leadersnip and organizational qualities, CISNEROS resigned

from the JUkE.

3.

In an effort to keep him out of our hair,

as he's

been on YUBARK's payroll since 1960:

we proposed that he

prepare a study on the Cuban secondary education system

before and alter Fidel Castro.

All arrangement for payment

were made through a third party. He was paid

sum of

$1200 for eight-typewritten pages - double spaced, a

project any non-Cuban could have written in less time

and expense.

In November 1964 CISNEROS asked for an additional

$650 for the study

so that he could enroll at the

University of Michigan's intensive inglish language course:

He was denied the additional sun, but went to the University

anway. He began the course in January 1965.

CISNEROS has now completed the course and has

retursed to his bome and family in Hiami.

Re feels that

with this new ability to speal and understand English,

he is better equipped

to continue the anti-Castro effort.

6. CISNEROS stated that while at the University be

became acquainted

with some young Dominicans and reportedly

he developed a good rapport with the men.

He wondered out

loud

if any use could

be made of the friendship in view of

the

activities in Santo Domingo.

The undersigned listened

attentively, but made no effort to educe further information

on

this subject.

7.

CISNEROS, as a recent "graduate",

is interested in

a job and implied

that he would like to work for KUBARK.

The undersirned indicated to him that jobs were scarce. but

that his interest in employment will be passed along

"my superiors".

The undersigned closed the conversation by

pronising that he would call during the week of 10 May and

convey any message received from

"upstairs".

B.

RECOYMENDATION: Unless the readers feel there may be

some value to CISNEROS' Dominican contacts. this writer opines

that we should not get involved with CISNEROS again, and that

he should be told there is

no work available for him at the

present, but should something open-up in the future we will

certainly keep him in mind.

Reason:

After his resignation

in September 1964 CISNEROS wanted Al Burt, Miami Herald

reporter; to do a news story on RAY pointing up the following

facts:

That RAY was a tool of the U. S. State

Department and received $25.000 per month from the

U. S. Government.

• (CISNEROS reportedly said that he

could doucment all facets of RAY's funding.)

b.

That RAY knows his failure to infiltrate

Cuba embarrassed his State Department friends,

but

State will continue to back him as their betrayed

revolution thesis

can be tied only to RAY's star

and as this theme has been sold to the United

states

Government at policy levels,

despite the

objection of KUBARK,

State has no

alternative but to

back RAY.

CISNEROS did not go through with this plan, but he will always

use this as a peg to blackmail. We have no obligation to

place CISNEROS on the KUBARK payrolls, either directly or

indirectly.

He is undoubtedly

witting of KLBARK's financial

role in RAY's aborted attempts to infiltrate Cuba, but

payments to RAY are untraceable. It is doubtfull that an
