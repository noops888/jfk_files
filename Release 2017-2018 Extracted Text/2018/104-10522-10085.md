Since ve had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI TC72 - para 37 above)

ve bave not requested Mexi gor to take y any action againat Silvia except to maintain

Increased surveillance of her activitles.

Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he had any

specific concrete evidence that sbe vas about to leave for Cube.

We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurats,

It 1s quite possible, and even probable, that contra-

dictory statements oade by Echeverria are explained by desire of COM to play dows Importance

of OSWALD visit hers, Marl Iine st111 L8 thri OSKALD visit related solely to vian question.

Consistent with this Echeverrla stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only Intarested in finding

Such fabrications are not usually done for money,

/ We do not think 1t.s

remarkable colacidence that both DORIICOS and ALVARADO talk about money paid to OSWALD:

For one thing, pay for an assassin is a factor which Immediately rises in the mind of

the perlod she now finds out that OSKALD was here in Mexi prior to the

assassination.

vas lavited by a Mexi secretary in the Cub Enh whose husband 18 a cousin of the GARRO

family (Horacio DIRAN????). At the party, she saw three Gringos, art drlnking. not mixtog,

and more or less just standing around together like

"three bumps on a log". They were so

obviously. out of place, she asked soneone In the Cub. Inb about them and was told that "they

were just passing as through". She claims that on socount of the way these three gringos

stood out she took a good long loos at then as did her daughter. When assassination occurred

and OSHALD's picture was spread into the newspapers, both Blens and her daughter immediately

said that he was ore of the three gringos "without a doubt" ai the party.

Note covering 'ebove meno to COS: Do you want me to send the fist of this to Hqs? COS wrote,

Yes, but we should follow up firet.

Flannery then wrote: Nothing further.

DIE 56876 (Ref: MEXI 1191 - para 397 above) Hqs has no evidence that Sove have advance copy

of photo.. Coum sources assure us its copy of photo furnished by the FBI has also been

altered to black out the background. At present the annex is scheduled for release around

mid Nor. / Considered opinion here is that Sor action per ref would seem to be a logical CI

step as & precautionary measure on basis ci published coom report. That a thorough

i security survey should be done at this time either on Sov Emb's own loftlative or as request

froa Moscou is not at all surprisine, independently of any specifice contained in Com report.

MEMO TO FBI fIon WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll Info he

allegedly received from a vell known Cubin solentist and acquaintance on 23 Nov-63, but which

he had forgotten to report.

The release of the Warren Corm Report reminded bim of the inc1-

dent. / The scientist said be bad been at the Havana airport on

afternoon of 22 Nov 63 wben

at 1700 hrs an aircraft with Mexi markings landed and parked at far side of the fleld.

Iwo men, whom be recognized as Cuban & "zangsters" alighted, entered rear entrance of

administration bidg and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures.

His

curlosity was arowed, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had Just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, via TIjuana and Nex1 City. The plane had boon forced to land at Tijuana dus

to ongine trouble.

By combining the date, the origin of the fllubt, and the known repatation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved in assassination..

He speculated that OSWALD had acted In the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubane had been

In Dallas to organize or overine the operation.

He told the source that he had been greatly

distressed by what he bad seen and teard and had to telll someone about 1t. He then cautioned

source not to tell anyone else about. it of they would man both be shot by the Cubana. /

The source has passed away since fuminhing above info, thus making any follow-up on
