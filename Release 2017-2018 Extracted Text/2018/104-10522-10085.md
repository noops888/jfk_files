to request visa to transit Cuba because he was going to dium go to Moscow
vie Habana, Consul Busebio AZCUB told OSWALD that he would have to
consult his government, that the paper work required 10 to 12 days.
OSWALD, because of his irritable character, became annoyed with AZCUB
and left the office slamming the door, On 28 Sept OSWALD went to the
Consul General of ths Sov Union to request a visa for Russia. He said

in helping his case, that his wife was a Sov citizen; that he was a
militant Communist and had lived three yrs in Russia. OSWALD told the
Sov Consul that he could verify this quickly by calling his wife who was
at that tins in New Orleans in @ hotel. The Sov Consul said he would
have to consult with his government end that ordinarily a case like this
would teks from three to four months. OSWALD egain bacume annoyed as he
bad the day before in the Cuban Embassy and left the office very mad,
OSWALD returned to Texas on 5 Oct- vin the border of Nusvo Laredo, Tamps.

thay let him enter (Ruby entering Jail where OSWALD was), Julieta says
be (Ruby) was there fron the first day, thet he began to mix with the
police and. newspapermn. It was perfectly plannad, indeed some of the
police probably are of the sama organization because Ruby mukxtuexgen
feirtioixtkaxebomxbtexmberts aimed the gun at his’ chest (CSWALD's).
Cecilia agrees, the picture is evidence of that because the police

did not move to try to get in or anything for within a question of
seconds there should have been a reaction. Julieta hopes they will
continue the investigation; at least Kennedy's brother has sent a special
agent. Cecilia says everything sbout it is strange as the paper stated
they found this character (Ruby) drinking Coca Cola on the second floor
and they just left him there. Julieta adda that from the @ vary first
everything was absurd, that be was a-Communist. Cacilia says this type
(OSWALD) ‘could not be nuts because the whole thing was ao perfectly
plenned and that ia evident since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy.

» Julieta believes that. this 1a all dona by extreme rightiste planned from

Julieta adde that she hopes they will wake up a little with this business
and pay attention to what has happened because it is evident. it is all a
conspiracy of rightist groupe and military men. She adds that in a very”
obvious way this individual (OSWALD) pretended he was a Communist to.
prepare the groundvork. Cecilia believes that he even purposely married
the Russian girl. Julieta comments that all was very well prepared,
step by step to blame the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD's
death) everything 18 more compli¢ated and they couldn't continue (the
investigation) and even the Dallas police aaid thet with the death of
OSWALD the case was closed, but the FBI answered immediately that it was

not closed, thet on the contrary, they had to open an investigation and
also the Senate will name a comission to investigate, and Julieta hopes
they won't be alarmed at whatever may be turned up. She adds that each
time more details a confirm that OSWALD was a Fascist and this business of
trying to join an anti-Castro organization and later poke his nose into

‘the Fair Play for Cuba surely ell of this was made up by the Dallas police.

Likewise she indicates that all the speeches given try to imply that he

_COSWALD) was a fanatic; also RIXON spoke to the peoples of the Nation to

stop this tendency toward violence and hate, Cecilia is tghed, that.

and, if things cae cut, that she hopes the public will be shaken up

so that they will stop this tendency toward Fasciss. Julieta continues
that at the beginning she thought it waa caused by racial trouble but

now she thinks it ig something more than that; it is a national thing
well planned and that OSWALD was not just acting spontancously. Cecilia
agrees, indeed it was a perfect shot with exact calculation and could not
have been done spontaneously, Julieta says that his (QSWALD's) death

was evidently to shut him up and they had better not sey now that Ruby
was at the moment emotional (when he shot OSWALD) because Ruby is the
type who could never be pictured asa great patriot since he has @
criminal record. Cecilia believes that Johnson (Pres.) and all those
people are paying attention to the strength in this. Julieta is sure

of this and adds that the news (press) was rediculous in respect to
OSWALD in that be went to marry a Russian, leter was photographed with the
Dally Worker; with the Communist newspaper in one hand and a Troskyist
one in the other hand; thus everything was very well prepared to blame
the leftists; indeed this has always been the way they have done it,
commit the terrorist acts and then try to make it appear that the acts
were done by the Communiste; that has always been the tactic and only

the people that have no iden about politics can swallow thoae things,

She ‘adds that this 1s very dangerous, indeed when they are able to assassinate
a president like Fennedy, imagine how strong they sre in the United S*ates.-

OLERVY will be advised, Since my cable of yesterday (MEXI 7072 - pera 97 above) there have

een three principal devslopments: 1) Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1639 hre lest evening called
DORTICOS of Cuba. In this conversation, which like the first is taped, LORTICOS expressed —
continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had interrogated Silvia about money.

2) ALVARADO, the Hic, was questioned by CAS officer until two a.m, this morning, This
officer was impressed by ALVARADO who hes offered make himeclf available as a witness and
who is now hiding in place provided by CAS. We cannot muarantee ALVARADC's safety. Wealth
of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities involved with OSWALD in Cub Emb:

ig striking, 3) At 1215 bre Mexi tine 27 Nov., CAS officer was admised by phone by
ECHEVERRIA thet be had rearrested Silvia today because he learned she was attempting to
leave Mexi for Habeos. However, Echeverria later told LEGAT thet he had decided to rearrest
Silvia to avoid any possibility Bbhe might escapt to Cuba and later be uneveailabls as a
witness, Since we had received'no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI 7¢72 -. para 97 above)
we have not requested Mexi gov to take g any action against Silvia except to maintain
increased surveillance of her activities, Echeverria later denied to LEGAT thet he had any
specific concrete evidence that she was about to leave for Cuba. We do not now know which

Echeverria statesents are sccurate, It is quite possible, and even probable, that contra-
dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play dows importance

of OSWALD visit hers. . Maxi line still is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question,

. Consistent with this Echeverria stated to LECAT that DORTICOS only interested in finding
. Oat whether Mexd authorities tried to pay a story from Silvia.

This ia cbviouply inerorrsat

Mexi préss has easy access, Possiblity of habeas corpus cannot be discounted. 4) We

heave as yet found no trace‘of the red headed Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him, 5) Ia addition to questions raised in yesterday's telegram

Washington should urgently coneider feasibility of recussting Mexi authorities to arrest

for interrogation; Eusebio AZCUE; Luisa CALDZRON and Alfredo MIRABAL. The two men are

Cuban retionals and Cuban consular officers, Luisa CALCERON is a de secretary in Cuban

consulate here. In this connection article II of Consular Convention between U. S. and Mexi

exempts from arrest “Consular officers, national of the state by which they are appointed,

and not eagaged in any private occupation for gain" except "when charged with the commission

of an act designated by. local legislation es crime other then misdemeenor and subjecting

ticket salesman and dispatcher for Transportes Frontera, advised that he prepared most of
the handwriting on the 2 Cet 63 manifest on which che name "OSWLD" and destination "Lered”
appear opposite Seat No. 4. He stated thet he did not write the "CSWLD" reservation info
and it was his opinion that the reservation hed teen made and the info recoraed by the
barsage bandler, Lucio Lor A DO is quite certain at the present time that the
individual designated on the list as “OSWLD" did not purchase a tic and did not travel
on the trip relating to that manifest, No tioxnet number was recorded for that person, and
@ search of the cotpany's records in Monterrey had failed to locate a ticket stub which
was net otherwise accounted for in connection with that particular trip. / The notations
by ALVARADO of "9 Lareds, 7 Monterrey” reflected that he had reported by radio to the
Monterrey offices of the conpany that the bus had departed with nine “paying” passengers
for Laredo and seven “paying” passe: tined for Monterrey. Listed under
Passengers" were “OS#LD" with no tient r, indicating he aia not travel; "Angel PEREZ"

and had not boarded the bus; and “Wicolas GCNZALEZ" Seat No, 10, listed as having traveled
on @ pass to Torreon. /.../ ALVARADO and Gilberto LOZANO stated that the notations on

the Lacs of the manifest referred to advances of funds made by ALVARADO to LOZANO from the
cash for repairs, parts or other vequirerents, Thay related that the passenger Lista

are not kept as a permanent record, and, when the canifest was looted in the "trash"

at the request of investigators of the Mexi Presidential Staff, the Blanks at the tope-

of the form had not been filled in as to time, destination, trip number, bus number, and
date, but they had completed these blanks from their personal knowledg® in order to make
that data clear to the investisators. They also had listed the nantes of the drivers on the

OSWALD, ¢te......they could offer no explanation as to how Mexican authorities had arrived

but pointed out that after the name was located on the manifest, they had riot been given
an opportunity of revieving, analyzing or checking out the data thereon. / Lucio LOPEZ
Medina, baggage and freisht handler at Transportes, related that he often-assists the
ticket salesman by recording reservetions and is quite certain that he wrote the "OSWLD”

‘at 1700 hres an aircraft with Mexi markings landed and parked at far side of the field.

: Two men, whom he recognized as Cuban @ “gangsters” alighted, entered rear entrance of

“ pdministration bidg and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures. His
curiosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had Just arrived from
Dallas, Texas, vis, Tijuana and Mexi City. Tie plane had been forced to land at Tijuana dus

‘ to engine trouble, By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

: ‘of the two man, he theorized that the two men must have been involved in assassination. .
He speculated that OSWALD had acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been
in Dallas to organize. or oversee the operation. He told the source that he had teen greatly
distreased by what he bad seen and keard and hed to tell] someone about it. He then cautioned
source not to tell anyone else about it or they would mm both be shot by the Cubans. /

FEMORARDUM OF comvensarton, )is Dec 65) between Elena GARRO de Paz and Charles Thomas, Political
Officer:

On 25 Dec Elena discussed her alleged encounter with OSWALD, Also present were
Thoms' wife, and Elena's deughter, Blenita. Further info was given subsequently on 9 Jan 66.
During this latter conversation, Elena admitted she nad gone to AmEmb on ean earlier occasion
with her daughter and mother-in-law and talked to two Emb officers (presumably from LECAT) about
this matter. She said since the Exb officers did not give much credence to anything they saia,
they did not bother to give a very complete story. The following info supplements and in
sone instances corrects that given in the memo of Dec 10, / 1. Lydia, Horacio, and Ruben
DURAN’ are all cousins of Elena. Silvia is married to Horacio, a weak’ ran, who was converted
to’ Cormuniss by Ricardo GUERRA. Elena has nothing to do with Silvia whom she detests and
considers @ whore. Ruben was born ia U.S. and served in U.S. srmy during war. ..,Party wae
held at home of Ruben, / Elena believes date of party was 2 or 3 Sept 63, few days before
visit of Sov astronaut, Gagarin, but is not sure of date.../ At she party OSWALD wore a black
sweater, He tended to be silent and stared at the floor. ‘wo young American companicns,

cone was very tall and slender and hed long blond hair mtx which hung across forehead, gaunt
face and long protruding chin; other was tall, short light brown bair,..All three were
obviously Americens and did not mix or dance with other people. ‘The three were friends,
because Elena saw them by chance the next day walking down the street together. / Although
Elena bad returned from Europe in June or July, she had already met Eusebio AZCUE and mows
positively he was at party. On another occasion (not clear whether before or after the party
in question), she attended a party where she saw Eusebio AZCUE; Emilio CARBALLIDO; and a Latin
American negro man with red hair. (These last 2 were not at tne DURAN party es waa stated,

in' the 10 Dec meno.) CAREALLIDO and AZCUE, with others, were in heated discussion on that
occasion about Kennedy and they came’ to conclusion that the only solution was to kill him.
Blena said CARBALLIDO is kmow as a Castro agent; he had been to.Red China, Sov Union, and
many times to Cuba.. Pollowing assaseination he epent a year in Cuba, then got @ job teaching
at Rutgers Universidy through Dr. Jose VASQUEZ Amaral, formerly with Rockeféller

oundation
in B.Y. and who ie now a f professor at Rutgers. The day after assassination, Elenita

encountered Sra. de AZCUZ in Sanborna. On seeing her, Sra. d¢ AZCUE burried out of store.
AZCUB waa called back to Habana after assassination and his wite followed shortly...

sequently wrote Zlenita several love letters. She turned these in to the Amer Emb.

Ricardo GUEAPA and wife Rosario CASTELLAMOS were supposed to come to party but declined to
coms when they learned she (Zlena) would be there. / On Sat., 2% Hov 63, Elena's brother
drove her and Eleaiga to Cub Enb at 3 pm. Her brother was embarrassed by their behavior

and drove a block up the atreet to wait for them efter letting them out. The two women then
went inside gate and shouled “essassin™ and other insults. Later that day @ friend, Manuel
CALVILLO took them to smll hotel for safety.,,..Since Elena could not remember nam of hotel,
she took Thomas to the part of towa where she remembered it to be - Vermont Hotel,

Calle Vermont 29, one and « half blocks west of Insurgentes just south of Viaducto. Elena
said hotel ie owned by somzone from San Luis Potosi and used by businessmen from that area.
She and Blenita did not register. CALVILLO registered them as relatives or friende of his
from San Luis Potosi, They stayed there until the following Fridey and hardly left their room.
/ Elena and Zlenita sew newspapers with OSWALD's picture and Imew they had sean him at party.
When CALVILLO viaited them at hotel, she told him she wanted to report to Amor Emb what she
imew about OSWALD's coanections with local communists and with AZCUZ. CALYILLO said she
shouldn't go because the Amer Emb was full of Communist spied. When she returned to ber howe

the latter was terrified because of OSWALD's presence at the DURAN party. . Sra. de GUERRERA

plot for money. About 2 acnths after assassination, Sr. (or Sra.?) de GUERRERO vas called in
by two communists, whom a she refuses to identify, and was warned with threats never to reveal
to anyone that she had been to a party with OSWALD, She remained so terrified that she would

tion, Emilio CARRALLIDO, took DURANS to Jalapa, Veracruz end kept them out of the way for a
