Following set forth in view Philadelphia contemplated

interview with ALLEN:

on 5/12/61, PSI JOSE M. NOUEL Y SIMPSON, whose

identity must be protected, advised SA C. GRAHAM HURST and SA

CHARLES W. EDMISTON that he is only able to furnish info of a

personal knowledge of events that occurred in the Dominican

Republic (DR) during 1958 and prior to that time.

He stated

In about 1953, the Fair opened in Cludad Trujillo, D..R. which

included exhibition buildings and amustment park.

Amusement

park was called Coney Island.

As PSI recalls, man named

HAMMOND Or HANNA, from Atlantic City, N. J. who rented and

sold circus equipment,

a man named BUCKY ALLEN, and JOE MANGONE,

brought the ferriswheel and other amusement equipment to D. R.

and sold it to govt.

These three men then leased Coney Island

from the govt. for $9,000.00 a month.

This Included gambling casinos which had black jack,

roulette and other games of chance.

Gambling casinos were

subsequently leased out by these men to several different

people at different times. HAMMOND, after a short time,

disassociated himself from ALLEN and MANGONE.

ALLEN and MANGONE continued to lease Coney Island

unt1l about 1957 when MANGONE left the business.

PSI

said

MANGONE pulled out because of small profits in Coney Island

operation which were not enough for two people.

MANGONE did

operate an amusement park at NW 79th St. and 27th Ave., Miami

and at present lives in an apartment building on south

end of

Miami Beach.

PSI said ALLEN did live in Allentown, Pa. and subsequently

in trailer park on 89th St., Miami; although he heard more

recently ALLEN livesTin Miami shores.

PSI said neither ALLEN nor MANGONE spent all of their

time in D.R. operating Coney Island, but they had as their

manager who operated for them a man

known to PSI as NORMAN (LNU).

PSI believes NORMAN still runs Coney Island for ALLeN. He

describee NORMAN (LNU) as white male, age 50-55, 5'10"

, 200 Ibs.,

heavy build, wore tourtoise shell glasses, had big hands and

big head, considers roustabout person.

NORMAN had 7 or 8 Americans working under him and

15 - 20 D.R. Nationals who cleaned up the grounds.

PSI Is not familiar with name NORMAN FROMKIN and

cannot say if NORMAN (LNU) is identical with FROMKIN.

PSI

believes NORMAN still is in D.R. and ALLEN travels most of the

time with a carnival or circus, name unknown to PsI.

Photo of ANGELO BRUNO was identified by PSI as a man

whose name he did not know who he saw one time in D.R. with

ALIEN and MANGONE in about 1957, and about the same time MANGONE

pulled out of the Coney Island operation.

PSI, at that time,

attempted to learn BRUNO's name from ALLEN and MANGONE, but

met with no success.

PSI said that even without his knowing the degree of

association between ALLEN and MANGONE and BRUNO, it was quite

apparent that BRUNO made the decisions in conversations between

the three of them during the brief time PSI had occasion to

be in their presence.

These decisions had to do with the

operation of Coney Island.

PSI has heard at present there is

little or no business at Coney Island because of lack of tourist

trade and also native children have long ago become tired of the

fair.

PSI stated there were always slot machines in casinos

In D.R. but he heard in the past year slot machines are on every

street corner and in every store.

PSI heard these machines

were put there by ALLEN and VIRGILIO ALVAREZ PINA, aka. "Cucho",

who i's Secretary of the Interior in D.R.

Miami has in dictation a report which sets forth in

detail ALLEN's contact with Miami FBI In 2/60,

at which time

he advised as a matter of info, of two shipments of slot machines

he was sending to D.R. addressed to Secretary of State, Minister

of Interior and Communications.

Subsequently, independent info

received on 3/14/60, that some slot machines destined for D.R.

were at Miami International Airport.

Investigation located 14

slot machines being sent to "Secretarie de estado Interio y

Cultas, Coney Island, Ciudad Trujillo, D. R. " with consignor

as Triangle Distributors, 15 Olney St., Providence, Rhode Island.
