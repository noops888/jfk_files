This material arrived attached

to a dispatch from

thought you might want to index

Richard Case NAGELL as a

crank because he is mentally

deranged. He was the sole

"survivor of an air crash of a

military craft in ca. 1956 and

suffered brain damage. He

has claimed CIA employment

but was never connected with

the Agency.
