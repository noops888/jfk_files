G-It is the bosic reaction § those trying to grazple with the
problea that the Agency nore appropriately should be cooperating with
with the F.d and the SSCT, organizations touni to adhere to certain
handling procedures in dealigg with classified inforzation, ex vhose
interests are more compatible with the linitations irnosed on CIA in
relation to domestic matters involving lav enforvexent.. It is felt
entirely appropriate that Sonator Hert be reninled of the difficulties
that CIA has in reviewing/and processing its docuwents for transmittal
outside the Agency to other goverrnent. agencies, in classified forn, and
how this is conminded when an agency such as. ie Dade County police are
involved’ Having becone involved in reviewing the problen, ond now
appreciating the nature of the problen, it is proposed that the ensvers-

“that can be msde to Section € of paregraph 3 of the request te offered

as noted, <Dipehding on the 0GC opinion on release of the nares of

However, the intent should be to direct the Dede County police to tha
