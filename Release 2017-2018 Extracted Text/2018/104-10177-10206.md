MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORL

SUBJECT: Joseph Raymond Merola

1, On 23 October, Mr. Robert Starling of DCD called to say that
Matthew McVane (phonetic), a DCD officer wno is stationed in Miami
i Florida, had received a telephone cali from a San Diego attorney saying
i : that he was mailing 2 Subpoena to him. The attorney, E. Mac Amos, Jr.,
: _ is « member of the iaw firm of Holt, Rhodes and Hollywood at 1010 ‘Second.
Avenue, San Diego, California 92101, telephone No. (AG 714) 238-1712.
- Mr. Amos advised Mr. McVane that the subpoena was for his appearance .
| on. behalf of Mx. Merola who was on trial in San Diego. ae

£2. .Mre Starliag indicated that the charges against Merola kad
‘something to do with exporting airplane parts without a license. I called
iMrz.Clyde Bryant, Office. of Munitions Control, Department of State, to
jetermine if this prosecution was related to 22 U.S.C. 1934. ~Mr. Bryant
‘ealled back and said that Merola was one 2f seven defendants being tried
“on criminal fraud charges for having engaged in 2 flimflam operation
‘against the Salvadorian. government.‘ The scheme was.to establish a ae
facility in Salvador to assemble and s-rvice helicopters." The group had
“Sassembled a collection of Army surplus parts for helicopters and was in
“the process of shigping them without an export license and they were
seized by U.S-iCustoms officers on 21 February 1974. Mr, Bryant
., indicated that the Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Diégo in charge of
“the prosecution was a Mr. Robert Thaller, telepkone No. (AC 714) 293-5668.
_Mr.. Bryant also indicated that an individual by the name of Henry Maier- ~~”
“/hoffer was also one of the defendants and it was Mr. Bryant's recollection
that Maierhoffer had some previous connection with CIA, °

“3. I called Mr; Starling and reported this information to him and

he. said that, Mr. Merola was a real operator in the Miami area, always
involved in some scheme to buy and sell weagons but that he had volua-
teered information to the DCD Office, some of which was useful. [ asked >:
Mr. Starling to have:Mr. McVane call me when he got the subpoena but

that he would not have to go unless they furnished the travel funds.
