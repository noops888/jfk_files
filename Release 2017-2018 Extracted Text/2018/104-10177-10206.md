MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Joseph Raymond Merola

Matthew MeVane (phonetic), a DCD officer wno is sationed in Miami.

Florida, had received a telaphone call from a San Diego attorney eayina

that he was mailing à subpoena to him.

The atoriey, E. Mac Amos, Jr..

is a menter of the law firm of Holt, Rhodes and Hollywood at 1010 Second

• Mr: Amos advised Mr. MeVane tha! the subpoena was for his appearance

Mr. Starling indicated that the charges against Merola kad

someching to do with exporting airplane parts without a license.

I called

Mr:. Clyde Bryant, Offico of Munitions Control, Department of State, to

determine if this prosecution was related to 22 U.S.C. 1934.-Mr. Bryant

called back and said that Merola was one of seven defendants being tried

on criminal fraud charges for having engaged in a flimflam operation

¿ against the Salvadorian government. The scheme was to establish a

facility in Salvador to assemble and sirvice helicopters. The group had

assembled a collection of Army surplus parts for helicopters and was in

the process of shipping them without an export license and they were

seized by U.S:'Custons officers on 21 February 1974. Mr. Bryant

indicated that the Assistant U.S. Attorney in San Diego in charge of

the prosecution was a Mr. Robert Thaller, telephone No. (AC 714) 293-5663.

Mr.. Bryant also indicated that an individual by the name of Henry Maler

hodier was also one of the defendants and it was ir. Bryant's recollection

i that Maierhoffer had some previous connection with CLA:

3.

I called Mr. Starling and reported this information to hirs and

he said that Mr. Merola was a real operator in the Miami area, always.

involved in some scheme to buy and seil weapons but that he had volun

teered information to the DCD Office, some of which was useful. I asked

Mr. Starling to have:Mr. McVare call me when be got the subpoena but

that he would not have to go unless they furnished the travel funds.
