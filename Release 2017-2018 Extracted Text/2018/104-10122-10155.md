who is believed identical to the above aaned individual.

A raview of cited file disclosed no evidence that : :
Walter L. Fitzpatrick had been employed by the Agency  , are
in the fall of 1965. The Office of Security file re-
flects that the first Agency interest in. Walter.L. aeeeretiec
Fitzpatrick occurred in February 1965 when he became = *
of interest to the Central Cover Staff in connection’.

with his employment as, the Office Manager for Robert A. é
Hat Associates in Washiugtqn, D.C. The Ceatral Cover i
Staff interest in Walter L.. Fitzpatrick centered on his

being the ostensible supervisor of an Agency employee

utilizing the cover of Robert A. Naheu Associates. The .. a
Central Cover Staff canceled their interest in Fitzpatrick —
in August 1963. -.

Walter L. Fitzpatrick became of interast to the
Agency again circa January 1973 when the Domestic Con-
tact Service requested the Office of Security to conduct os
security checks on Mr. Fitzpatrick. The resuits of the
security checks were reported to the Douestic Contact-
Service on il July’ 1973; however, the file does not
refloct the reason for the Domestic Contact Service
request, nor whether Nr. Fitzpatrick was ever actually
‘contacted or utilized by the Donestic Contact Service.
Hith the exception of the above Agency interest, the . _
Office of Socurity file does not reflect any other
relationshia or association between the Agency or
Walter L. Fitzpatrick.
