CONTACT REPORT:

PERSONS PRESENT: AMLASH/1, Matthew H, ONTRICH, (alias
Nicholas Sansen)

TIME & PLACE: 22 November 1963, Charlie Gray's Apt.,
Paris, France

1. AMLASH/1 planned return, and held reservations on Cubana
from Prague to Havana on 28 November 1963. He planned depart Paris
on 25 or 27 November for Prague on Czech Airlines but still did
not have reservations. He was asked to inform Mr, Roberto (Bob
Owen) when reservations confirmed.

2, AMLASH/1 stated he was returning to Cuba fully determined
to pursue his plans to initiate a coup against AMTHUG. Subject was \
pleased to read a copy of President Kennedy's 18 November speech }
in Miami and was even more pleased to hear that Mr. Clark (DAINOLD)
had helped prepare the President's speech. ONTRICH reiterated
the assurances given by DAINOLD of full U.S. support if a real
coup against the AMTHUG regime is successful.

3. AMLASH/1 continued to insist that as long as AMTHUG is
around the number of individuals knowledgeable of a coup against
the regime must be kept to an absolute minimum. The individuals in
whom AMLASH/1 has the most confidence and whom he believes can be
trusted in the initial stages of the operation if it is necessary
to cut other individuals in are:

a. Cmdte, Efigenio Amajeiras Delgado

b, AMTRUNK/10

€. Jose Naranjo Morales, Mayor of Havana.

d, Jose Assef, former sub-Sec. Ministry of Interior and

presently Assistant to Naranjo, Municipality of Havana.

AMLASH/1 feels that once AMTHUG is removed, the following officers
can be counted on to support the coup:

a. Cmdte. Raul Diaz-Arguelles Garcia

b. Nieves Brothers

c. Capt. Fausto Lopez Miranda

4 d, Capt. Juan Nuiry Sanchez who is a close friend and
can influence stand of Capt. Felipe Guerra Matos.
M Once coup appears successful, AMLASH/1 feels the following officers
i will fall in line:
i . a. Gmdte. Juan Alm@dja Bosque
i b. Cmdte. Faure Chomon Mediavilla (must check
H Chomon thoroughly to determine extent and depth
i of his ideological feelings toward Marxism, AMLASH/1L
{ is not completely sure of him at this point).
c. Gustavo Arcos Berghes, Amb. to Belgium.
| d, Enrique Rodriguez- Loech&,” Amb. fo. Morocco
i e. Cmdte. Antonio Castell’
Although it has never been confirmed to AMLASH/1 that KUBARK is
in contact with AMTRUNK/10, AMLASH/1 again mentioned as he had
several times in the past meatiened his concern for the security
AMTRUNK/1O, and his feeling if AMICE/14 continueg to contact
himjinside Cuba we rin the risk of losing him.
4, AMLASH/1 asked for the following items to be included in
1 a cache inside Cuba: 20 hand grenades, 2 high power rifles
with scopes and approximately 20 lbs, C- -4 and related equipment.
AMLASH/1 suggested best place for cache was finca managed by
AMTRUNK/1O.
| - 5. Since he was returning via Prague AMLASH/1 did not
| désire to carry any incriminating material with him. In order to
provide him time to establish his normal pattern once he returned
to Havana, it was agreed his S/W material would not be sent to
i him until sometime between 5-15 January 1964, AMLASH/1 suggested
| and C/O agreed he should not engage in any activity which may
draw suspicion to him for at least a month. During December he
planned attending the various anniversary functions coming due
during this month and again speaking in Santa Clara as he has done
each year in the past on the anniversary date of the battle of
Santa Clara. He also felt this would give him an opportunity to
check the pulse of his friends in that city.Don Roberto (Bob Owen)
arranged the attached plan for the S/W delivery which if needed

1, Cosmunications problem and training: -

AMLASH sensitive this point but believe he will see need good, rapid
H commo if we to provide support he needa,
| Beat solution to como problem would be:

8. Olive AMIASH two weeks of intensive como training on AR-48 so that.
he will be knowledgeable cnough to train tifa om comme operator inside PERUMEN.
(We realize AMLASH personally will not maintain a satieiuctory comno link, therefore,
we feel boat solution ts for him to find a trusted person to do it for him, Best
poustbility appears te be his foraer secretary whom he claims to trust.)

tb, AMLASH already trained in S/w but wrote only two letters in one year.
One letter was never received, Extra carbons and developer pills are in brown
envelope in safe marked “AMLASII/1 SW Carbons and Pills.” (AMLASH/1 may also be
able to train the above redio communicator and use her or him as case may be to
write his 3/W messages.)

@, Xf and when the training can be given a trainer will cone to do

2. If the opportunity presents itself it would be helpful to have more
of the following information before cur final period of briefings and discussions

Proposed address for delivery of S/W material

tee epee era

Residence of Ernestina ("Ene") ACOSTA

Located at top fleor, modern apartment buildin: at corner of|
streets in Havana. See sketche i

Friend said that it is a *casa de Imespedes"# "Ene" thus is one of
‘everal young wonen vio live in the apartment. Everybody is “de
contianza” according to our friend but he doesn't seem to know the
fanes of the other inhabitants and cannot say vhether or net there
are any other apartments on the[  |flocr. He, does not know whether
or not there is an elevators

‘The telephone at the apartment if) Anyone may answers ineluding
"Ene".

oo) oe

SEne* is a pharmaciste

Proposed time of delivery of S/W material
During the first two weeks of Janusrye ,

Proposed method of delivery.
Person to deliver (or obviously someone working with that person) calls

preferably about 0800 hours, and asks for "Ene". The

conversation should then go approximately as followss

our *lamo para saber si conseguistes 1a medicina -
evil BARS" to para mama."

(*Ene® (4f conditions are right for delivery)
S54, pasa por aqui para entregartela."
(iff conditions are not right for delivery)

€No, no la tengo todavia. Vuelve a llamar eoccccee™

If the answer is affirmative, our person goes dnmediately to the buildings

It seems best that our person gO to the apartment where "Zne" is and for
her to be waiting there at the door. An alternative, which can be
established by the person telephoning, can be to make delivery in the
entrance to the ‘building. However, that entrance is visible clearly

from the streste

On delivering the S/W material, our person simply hands the envelope
(preferably one with the name of a nedicAl lab or the medical faculty)

to "Bnet".
