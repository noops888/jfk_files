CONTACT REPORT:

PERSONS PRESENT:

TIME & PLACE:

AMLASH/1, Matthew H. ONTPICH, (alias

Nicholas Sanson)

22 November 1963, Charlie Gray's Apt.,

Paris, France

1. AMLASH/1 planned return, and held reservations on Cubana

from Prague to Havana on 28 November 1963. He planned depart Paris

on 25 or 27 November for Prague on Czech Airlines but still did

not have reservations. He was asked to inform Mr. Roberto (Bob

Owen) when reservations confirmed.

2. AMLASH/1 stated he was returning to Cuba fully determined

to pursue his plans to initiate a coup against AMTHUG. Subject was

pleased to read a copy of President Kennedy's 18 November speech

in Miami and was even more pleased to hear that Mr. Clark (DAINOLD)

had helped prepare the President's speech. ONTRICH reiterated

the assurances given by DAINOLD of full U.S. support if a real

coup against the AMTHUG regime is successful.

3. AMLASH/1 continued to insist that as long as AMTHUG is

around the number of individuals knowledgeable of a coup against

the regime must be kept to an absolute minimum. The individuals in

whom AMLASH/1 has the most confidence and whom he believes can be

trusted in the initial stages of the operation if it is necessary

to cut other individuals in are:

a. Codte. Efigenio Amejeiras Delgado

b. AMTRUNK/10

c.

Jose Naranjo Morales, Mayor of Havana.

d. Jose Assef, former sub-Sec. Ministry of Interior and

presently Assistant to Naranjo, Municipality of Havana.

AMLASH/1 feels that once AMTHUG is removed, the following officers

can be counted on to support the coup:

a. Codte. Raul Diaz-Arguelles Garcia

b. Nieves Brothers

c. Capt. Fausto Lopez Miranda

d. Capt. Juan Nuiry Sanchez who is a close friend and

can influence stand of Capt. Felipe Guerra Matos.

Once coup appears successful, AMLASH/1 feels the following officers

will fall in line:

a. Omdte. Juan Almedia Bosque

b. Cmdte. Faure Chomon Mediavilla (must check

Chomon thoroughly to determine extent and depth

of his ideological feelings toward Marxism. AMLASH/1

is not completely sure of him at this point).

c. Gustavo Arcos Berghes, Amb. to Belgium.

d. Enrique Rodriguez-Loech&, Amb. to Morocco

e. Codte. Antonio Castell'

Although it has never been confirmed to AMLASH/1 that KUBARK is

in contact with ASTRUNK/10, AMLASH/1 again mentioned as he had

several times in the past mantioned his concern for the security

Of MTRYNK/10, and his feeling 1f AMICE/14 continues to contact

him/inside Cuba we run the risk of losing him.

4. AMLASH/1 asked for the following items to be included in

a cache inside Cuba: 20 hand grenades, ? high power rifles

with scopes and approximately 20 lbs. C-4 and related equipment.

AMLASH/l suggested best place for cache was finca managed by

AMTRUNK/10.

5. Since he was returning via Prague AMLASH/1 did not

desire to carry any incriminating material with him. In order to

provide him time to establish his normal pattern once he returned

to Havana, it was agreed his S/W material would not be sent to

him until sometime between 5-15 January 1964. AMLASH/1 suggested

and C/O agreed he should not engage in any activity which may

draw suspicion to him for at least a month. During December he

planned attending the various anniversary functions coming due

during this month

and again speaking in Santa Clara as he has done

each year in the past on the anniversary date of the battle of

Santa Clara. He also felt this would give him an opportunity to

check the pulse of his friends in that city. Don Roberto (Bob Owen)

arranged the attached plan for the S/W delivery which if needed

still be ured, but OTATCH arranged the folloring chonge with

1ld3l/1 in case the porson making the delivery does not icalie

perconal contact with Bincating Acost:.

"¿oposei ddress for dolivery of 5/: metoria: # 56638

romains the some, tiar urd cutes of delivery the sire.

b.

Alternate mottod of cellurry:

A letter containing the S/i aterin is placed in Ernestina's

mailhog in the building. Once the lotter in placed in the

mailbor, the person makirg the dcliver; onlie Cane", it 30-3?119

giving the nane "Luis", le talls hor that le sort the redicino

for her nother over to ter, "In te trade la pedicina pora tu

inama"

The envelope should preferably have on it the name

of a medical lab, and the S/! pille should be in a small

envelope, also containing the name of the medical lab.

(One in Moxico is fine).

The lotter to "Ene" should simply state "enclosed is

the medicine you requested I get for jou, signed "buis".

Letters signed "Luis" will be written on the S/ü carbon,

and indicate resupply of S/ü mtericl.

Letters signed "Tepe" will contain an Sir message.

MILASH1 hesitated when asked if he was

sure there were mil-

boxes in the building, but then answered he was sure there vere.

Il by any chance there are no mailboxes in the building, the

inchvicual maling delivery should simply call "üne" and tell acr

he has the medicine for her and tell her where to pick it up.

6.

ANLASH/l's Ops thinking appeared much less fossy than before.

He is now also including in his planning the necessity for taking

over the lavana radio station in the early stages in order to broad-

cast his appeal for support.

7. when coming out of the meeting the C/O and d'Lisil1 vere

informed of the assassination of President jennedy. AL15H/1 was

visibly moved over the news. He asked the question "why do such things

happen to good people?"

8..

AMLASH/1 was given $350.00 for personal expenses. l

1, Comunications problem and training:

AMIASH sensitive this point but belleve he will see noed good, rapid

commo if we to provide support he needa.

Beat solution to commo problem would be:

•. Oive AMLA3H tws weaks of intenaire commo training on AR 48 so that.

he 911l be knowledgeable enough to train hia on ocano operator inside PaRUMsY.

(We realize ANLASH personally will not mintain a satleinotory commo link, therefore,

we feel boat solution is for him to find a trusted person to do lt for him. Best

poustbility appears to be his foraer secretary shon he claima to trust.)

D. AMIASH already trained in 3/W but wrote only two letters in one yeur.

One lotter was never received. Extra carbons and developer pille are in brown

envelope In safe marked "AMLASI/1, SW Carbons and P1lls." (AMLASH/1 may also be

able to train the above radio coamunicator and use her or him as case may be to

write his 3/W messages.)

0, If and shen the training can be given a trainer will come to do

the job.

2. If the opportunity presents itself 1t would be helpful to have more

Proposed address for delivery of S/l material

Residence of Ernestina ("Ene*) ACOSTA

Located at top fl00r, modern apartment buildiny at corner of

streets in Havana.

See sketche

Friend said that it is a "casa de huespedes"*

"Ene" thus is one of

several young women who live in the apartment.

Everybody 1a

"de

conflanza" according to our friend but he doesn't seem to know the

names of the other inhabitants and cannot say whether or not there

are any other apartments on thel

floor•

He, does not know whether

or not there is an elevator.

The telephone at the apartment 1:l

Anyone way answer, Including

"Ene"o

The address is a

of the Unit. of Havana.

"Ene" 1s & pharmacisto

Proposed time of delivery of S/W material

During the first two weeks of January.

Proposed nethod of delivery.

Person to deliver (or obviously someone working with that person) calle

preferably about 0800 hours, and asks for "Ene", The

conversation should then go approxinately as follows:

"Llano para saber si conseguistes la medicina

pars mama."

("'Ene"

(1f conditions are right for delivery)

"S1, pasa por qqui para entregartela.*

(116 conditions are not right for delivery)

¿No, no la tengo todavia. Vuelve a Ilamar.

If the answer is affirmative, our person goes immediately to the building.

It seems best that our person go to the apartment where "Ene" Is and for

ber to be waiting there at the door. An alternative, which can be

established by the person telephoning, can be to make delivery in the

entrance to

the building. However, that entrance is visible clearly

trom the street.

On delivering the S/l material, our person simply hands the envelope

(preferably one with the nane of a medical lab or the medical faculty)

to "Bne".
