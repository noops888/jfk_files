MEMO FOR FILE i Not

SUBJECT 3 LA Division File Search

1. Inet with Bill Sturbitts and Chris Hopkins for about an
hour this afternoon to review the statua of the La task force gn the
Cuban ops files. Essentially the original 900 files have been reviewed,
plus some 300 files to which the material in the 900 files led. Chris
was reminded in the course of this of a sensitive operation that de
never had access to at the time she was in Gihah ops, ZRKNICK. It was
an intercept of a Cuhan OWVL and provides names of a variety of CUIS
types and what they were reporting, Some 12 boxes of this material
have bien searched, and there remain two larg boxes bf carded material
that requires meticulous review; based on the earlier search referebces
in this maternal suggests other materials to be checked,
2. Items found to date add but marginally to what is known
already. We talled about how to present it for the final report. I -
envishoned separate ya ckages covered with a brief description or explanati on,
which would be used for writing a final report with some attachments, but
the fist set of packages or bundles being held for the record of the
research, Documents with any referebce to assassination were pulled;
they may contain condolences, but nothing operational. Some few itens
are intrig ing but not of substantive meaning that can yet be identified.
Samples of problems, not all stemming from these materials:
ae Reference was made to a latter in 1962 from a Cuban requesting.
the addressee in thé US about assassinations. &hm-attespt ‘is-béing:made
be identifyethe persons, nut at present it is an inteiguing but not

very meaningful iten.



b. There are some gaps in the files at the "critical
perood," which they think reflects documents taken from the
file to serve other resear-h purposes at fhe time of the Warren
Comakssion inquiry; the transcripts, for instance, are not there,
though known to exist elsewhere.

ce I mentioned the speculation in 0/S about Frank Sturgis”
making mention of Juan Orta's role prior to our having released
anything on this outside the agency, and what it might mean
about who knew what re Trafficante, etc. Sturbitts said that
Orta's daughter has asked the Agency for the mss. of a book or diary
done by Orta during his taking haven in the Mexican embassy in
Havana. Orta came ow; of Havana and someone itetohitth..and::tobk the

ubssesendingiitito Miami, where the CA people took pooseesions

A search for the mss has been fruitless to date

remenbers its existence, but noti:its contents| may:

know, but he has retired, The diary may contain very significant

mayerial, but Sturbitts recalls large burnings of paper when the
station changed from a large to small one; it ‘could have gone up in
the flames then. A search for the mss continues.
3. By and large, the projest is moving to a conclusion, When
LA finishes, we can assemble what has been found, which seems not to be all
that much, and a final sumary can be undertaken. In terms of what has
Ymen found to date it would seem that we have little to add to what ,e
already Imo. i
