For the benefit of Philadelphia, PG 545-C, who has furnished
considerable information concerning subjects! legitimate
enterprises particularly real estate transactions involving
SAM MANNARINO, advised during 2/58 that SAM MANNARINO during :
early 1957 mentioned he had purchased a hunting lodge surrounded
py 200 acres of land. At the time PG 545-C understood

/ MANNARINO to say the lodge was located in Somerset.County, P.
and extensive investigation has been conducted to date in an

effort to identify the hunting ‘lodge since several sources al
| v - here believe the lodge would be an excellent hide-out for '

PG.. 92-228
PG 92-236

during 12/57 to-avoid being served with a subpoena before

a Federal Grand Jury in the Southern District of New York
inquiring into the significance of the conference of
hoodlums at Apalachin, New York, 11/14/57. As a matter of
information, Senator JOHN MC CLELLAN, Chairman of the U.S.
Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor
or Management Field, has issued statements to the press that
he corisiders GABRIEL MANNARINO one of the most important
witnesses yet to be heard by the committee. Since MANNARINO's
disappearance from New Kensington in 12/57 various reports
have been received that MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding
out together, 2 i

In connection with efforts to identify the location of the
hunting lodge PG 545-C on 10/28/58 learned through JACK
KRUPA, a New Kensington, Pa., councilman and life-long friend
and hunting companion of the MANNARINO brothers,.that SAM
MANNARINO's hunting’ lodge is not located in-Somerset County,
Pa., but.is actually a twenty room farm house generally
referred to as a hunting lodge surrounded by approximately .
200 acres of densely wooded land in Pennsylvania near the
Pennsylvania-Maryland border approximately a fifteen minute
drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland. . PG 545-C
was unable to obtain any additional identifying information
pecause of the likelihood of arising KRUPA's suspicions.

‘Examination of available maps of the area indicate that

the hunting lodge must be located in Franklin County
probably in the general vicinity of Waynesboro and
Greencastle, Pa.

PG 545-C also recalled that he was in SAM MANNARINO's office
at the Ken Iron and Steel Company, New Kensington, during
12/57, when the press and radio carried the first accounts
of MANNARINO being called before the. Federal Grand Jury

in New York. Informant stated that while he was at the
office Deputy Marshals were attempting to locate GABRIEL
MANNARINO when his brother SAM recéived a phone call from
GABRIEL MANNARINO and hurriedly told him "They are trying
to serve you with a subpoena, take off for the brush."

PG. 545-C said that in view of MANNARINO's prolonged

‘disappearance. it seems’ logical to assume that if SAM

MANNARINO's remarks were interpreted literally his
advice "take off for the brush" could have been his subtle

way of telling GABRIEL to hide .outsiat the hunting lodge.

With respect to background. information concerning the lodge

or farm house near the Maryland border’ PG 545-C pointed :
out that KRUPA who has been a'frequent- visitor to the location
told. him that. SAM MANNARINO has: several four wheel
drive.trucks and other heavy equipment parked on the

property that’ are used from time to time by some of the

local’ residents. Informant said that according to KRUPA

the general area is thickly populated with whiskey

stills and that local game wardens are reluctant to

enter the.area.apparently because’ some of them have been
mistaken for ATU Agents and fired upon by moonshiners.

PG 545=-C.also developed from KRUPA that occasionally ‘while

on hunting trips with SAM MANNARINO they would stay ina hotel
in-a nearby town (possibly Waynesboro) instead of sleeping :
over night at the farm house.
Philadelphia through Recorder.of Deeds for Franklin County,
Pa.,. attempt to.identify the 200 acres of land and hunting
lodge owned by SAM.MANNARINO. The property is probably
recorded in MANNARINO's name, however, if county records

‘fail to disclose desired information check names of the

followingswho in the past. have been used as legitimate business
fronts. by MANNARINO: : . :

ROSE -MANNARINO (wife)

VICTOR and MINNIE CARLUCCI (son-in-law and daughter)
GENEVIEVE MORENO (SAM MANNARINO's private secretary)
KATHLEEN MORENO (secretary's: daughter)

If property, recorded in. Franklin County records obtain
prief legal description, volume and page number where
recorded and examine Pennsylvania Transfer Tax Stamps

attached to: deed in order that sale price may be
computed.

PG 92-236 :

In addition Philadelphia at Waynesboro, Pa., and vicinity
near the Maryland border display photos of GABRIEL MANNARINO
and JOHN. LA ROCCA to game wardens, reliable police officers
and sources to locate the hunting lodge and determine whether
MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding out at. that location or
have peen. there in the past six to ten months.

Should the lodge be located extreme caution should be used
