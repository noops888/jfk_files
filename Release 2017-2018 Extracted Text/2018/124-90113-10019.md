Mr. HARRY M. EDELSTEIN,

Assistant Solicitor, Public Lands

Department of the Interior, has been acquainted with Mr.

WASSERMAN since he came to the Interior Department. He said that their

socially on a few occasions.

He has no knowledge of any organizations of

which Mr. WASSERMAN might be a member, and stated that he considers

the employee to be a very conventional person who is absorbed in his vork

Mr. EDELSTEIN concluded by stating that he would be very

surprised if the employee were tied up in any way with any organigation.

his wife,

FRANCES, are on Intimate terms with HARPY DEXTER WHITE and his wife,

ANNE, subjects in a Soviet expionage conspiracy in Washington, D. C. and Nev

York City during the early 1940's; also that he 1s a close associate of known

Communists and pro-Soviet sympathizers. He corresponds frequently with

MICHAEL E. NAIGIES, suspected espionage agent in New York City. In a pre-

vious investigation of Mr. EDELSTEIN 1t was also determined that EDELSTEIN

and his wife were members of the Washington Bookshop, the United American-

Spanish Aid Connittee, and that MI. EDELSTEIN was listed as a member of the

National Lawyers Guild and a contact of Commonwealth College in Mena, Arkansas.

The records of the Circuit Court at Polk County, Mena, Arkansas,

reflect that on January 29, 1941, criminal proceedings were instituted against

Commonwealth College, charging that the college had displeyed an illegal emblem,

the hammer and sickle, had failed to display the American flag, and had taught

anarchy. On January 30, 1941 the College was found guilty as charged and

judgment entered by the court in favor of the state of Arkansas.

In Addition,

the Court ordered the certificate of incorporation of the college to be can-

celled.

In the previous investigation of Mr. EELSTEIN 1t was also

determined that Mrs. EDELSTEIN is listed as a member of the Washington

Committee for Democratic Action, the American Peace Mobilization, and

the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties.

The Washington

Bookshop, the Washington Committee for Democratic Action, and the National

Federation for Constitutional Liberties are organizations declared by the

Attorney General to fall within the purview of Executive Order 9835.
