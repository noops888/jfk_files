1, During JKLANCE'S most. recent! attempt ‘to contact
ANETROPIA-1 via AMMNUG-1, it became readily apparent that
the cover story AMNUG-1 utilized with his immediate
superior was unsatisfactory from two points: First, it
did not permit us the operational flexibility so necessary.
in an approach of this sort and secondly, if AMMUG~1 had
not returned when he did, -his job security would have been
jeopardized, 7

2, To correct, the above deficiency, has |
arranged the following with the Miami Field CEH FO):
In the future, if we again utilize ANMUG-1 to approach a
PBRUNEN official, we will ask that the MFO arrange to have
one of their représentatives from their Headquarters ° :
component contact tie approprinte senior official of
AMMUG-1's company. ‘This senior official will in turn
nétify AMNUG-1's immediate stiperior that AMMUG-1 is to be
permitted to travel on matters of importance to the
Department of Defense,

3. Transmitted under separate cover is a copy of
a memorandum wo received from the MFO concerning the above
arrangements,

it of U.S. InimigraWion Official to AMMUG-1

INES

ACTION. REQUIRED: None, FYI only.

During the'undersigned's most recent meeting with
AMMUG-1, the agent stated that a Mr. Rex M. Griffin, an
investigator of the U.S, Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS) had visited him on 13 April 1971. According to ANMUG-1,
the purpose of Griffin's visit was to inquire into AMMUG-1's
present welfare and to determine his relationship to

Mr. Rodino, (COMMENT: Mr. Rodino is the sponsor of

HR. #2076 which will expedite AMMUG-1's application for U.S.
citizenship by waiving the standard waiting period.) When asked
about his relationship with Mr, Rodino, AiIMUG-1 simply explained
that Mr. Rodino was a friend of his from Washington,

: 2. Griffin explained that the reason that he wanted to
talk to AMMUG-1 personally, was the fact that nearly all of the
information surrounding ANMUG-1 was held in INS% office in
Washington, He added that the information that was held by the
Miami office was closely held and access to the files was
severely restricted, During his visit, Griffin asked AMMUG-1 if
he noticed any unusual interest in his comings and goings, to
which ANMUG-1 replied negatively.

i 3. In view of above, believe it reasonable to assume that
Griffin suspects that JKLANCE is somehow involved with AMMUG-1.
This position is concurred in by Station Officer who maintains

liaison with the Miami office of the INS,

4.  AMMUG~1 characterized Mr, Griffin's visit as being
very pleasant and commented that he was “muy amable"., In sum,
there does not appear to be any need for intervention on
AMMUG-1's behalf or on that of the Station. If the need does
arise, we will promptly, inform Headquarters,

approached (at our behest) during the Pan American games
which were held in Puerto Rico in 1966, He commented that
FRANCO dismissed AMMUG-1's initial approach out of hand
stating that he was a Marxist-Leninist. . According to AMMUG-1,
while a follow-up was Supposed to be made in Caguas, Puerto
Rico, the staff officer who was accompanying AMMUG-1 decided
against it,
