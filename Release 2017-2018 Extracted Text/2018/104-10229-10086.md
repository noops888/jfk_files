‘Project AMBUD

UFGA 18908, 4 December 1964

1. Headquarters regrets that it has not been possible to
reply to reference sooner, The delay has resulted from the
need to review carcfully the files on this activity. It is
apparent from previous correspondence that approval to terminate
subsidy. -payments will have to be obtained ‘from higher authority -
which not yet been done,

‘| 2. You may rest assured that Headquarters sympathizes
wth your point of view in the matter and: will endeavor to take

“action if appropriate authority can be obtained, However, this
is likely tobe a slow process and you are requested to continue
the program until euch time as you are advised to the contrary.

3. The second reference cited in ref dispatch is apparently
in error, Please forward the correct reference which Headquarters
might have located if the files on this case were not so sadly

deficient,
