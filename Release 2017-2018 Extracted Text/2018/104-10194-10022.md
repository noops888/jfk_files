Mr. Hidalgo is an experienced and vell qualified operations

Hidalgo, Balmes N.

sir. Hidalgo 1s a gregarious uncomplicated person, renerally

pleasant,

and. gencrous in his: instincts-but not.entircly without

his guixotic sider and one whose natural Latin emotionality has

been intensified by a life of experiences outside the norm, eg.

years as a CP penetration, air crashes, war wounds, etc.

This officer is aware that his intellectul background and

medical dcbilities

are. obstructions to.his. advance.

Understandably,

he has developed outside interests, apparchtly as compensation.

Expectedly, his attitudes at times so reflect.

In sum, Ar. Hidalgo serves i satisfactory function on the

Desk and no doubt could continuc to perform so

indefinitely,

but in view of his limitations in a desk-bound

situation and the medical restiictions, both of which

will

. continue to inhilit his advance in his present component, this

supervisor endorses fir. Hidalgo's desire to be considcred for

transfer to another component, namely OTR (specifically covert

training), where his attributes would likely conc more directly

into play.

le has the opcrational cxpordence, competency in &

regardless of the

the grading officer finds much to

several times during the first part of 1966 but these absences

were

for a limited period. From my observation, his health has not

presented a serious problem to the performance of his duties.

Several

times during the absence of Mr. Tsikerdanos in the year

1966 Hir. Hidalgo was the acting desk officer.

His performance was

sost satisfactory, and his supervision of the other desk employees,

albeit for a limited period, was fully satisfactory.

Mr.

Hidalgo's fluent knowledge of Cuban Spanish, his loss 30 M

experience in DD/P Cuban operations, and his broad knowledge of Cuba

(people, geography, customs, etc.) made him a particularly usalth a

versatile operations officer during his assigiment in the WH/SA

counterintelligence operations section.

As indicated in Section B

(epecific duties) he perforned a wide variety of duties.

Mr. Hidalgo approached and performed his assignments with enthusiasm,

keeness,

dedication, and promptness. He displayed a partioular talent for

conducting debriefings, and it was in this type activity that he performed best.

He also writes well which added to his debriefing capability as well as to

his performance as a Headquarters desk operations officer in writing cables,

Mr. Hidalgo performed most of his duties with i minimum of supervision.

In a few instances, however, he had a tendency (in his eagerness and desire

to get the job done well) to become impatient with the slow and dellberate

pace of progress which is sometimes necessary in operational activities.

• In these few instances, Mr. Hidalgo's work required supervision by a

senior operations officer.

COMMENTS OF REVIEMINO OFFICIAL

Mr. Hidalgo is a sound operations officer with native fluency in Spanish.

impatience is with administrative delays rather than with operational problems

which he understands fully and handles well. He has had problems with his

health but these largely have been overcome and in the past 9 months have not

impeded, his operational usefulness.
