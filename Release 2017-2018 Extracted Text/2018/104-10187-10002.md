1; Attached herewith Is’a sterilized copy of the Memorandum
of. Agreement executed with LIMOUSINE on 3 february 1965. Three
Sign ad-and-dated copies are retained in Station files. Both
LIMOUSINE and his wife appeared and sighed the agreement,

“Robert L. EASBY acting: for. OOYOKE, ‘It will be noted that the final
terms were somewhat more favorable than Heedquarters had authorized.

2. Station had emple opportunity to study the plans and they
were so ideal: from both the ‘operational and living standpoint that
_no changes were required. Bulging can therefore begin almost at
once; and ‘the forecast for completion Is‘stI!l about | July.

Consideration had-been given Inthe Station to Installing
a ‘ansmitters In. the: two lower apartments In
“vlewof their probable’ attract lvéness to FJSTEAL personnel.
It Is -Station's:view. that given LIMOUSINE's close Involvement with
RUBARK on a@ number of matters It would be well nelther to have. too
much FUSTEAL Interest aroused In‘ the building nor to give them the
opportunity to observe the pattern of LIFEUO/6 at such slose range.

4, With reference to paragraph. 5 of the memorandum, Station will
_ probably. decide. to. have LIFEUD/6- draw-up a-normal-contract with
LIMOUSINE and pay him his rent,:which will be passed by LIMOUSINE to

Station. at regular Intervals. The question of how to route an
apparently normal ‘transaction around LIMOUSINE 's bookkeeper has not

yet been resolved. : . o

©" ya1955 KUBARK purchased the LIMITED propéety (215 0. setres of and

renovatiors to accoimodate KUBARK operational: requirements.
” Bécauie af ite ides) location directly acrods the street from the

“"YBSR Bobassy, this”property which. wae for sale vas purchased so KUBARK could

establish control over this specific piece of property at that time. Yor
reasons of security, legal title for LIMITED wasvested in agent LIMOUSINE
vho-acted as thé cut-out vehicle. A stetewent of trust is on file at the
Btation in which LIMOUSINE acknowledges KUBARK's true ownership of the —-
property.  LIMITAD bas been used operationally with outstanding success and
presumably without compromise, and it is WH's intention to continue using

ite

a It recently developed that part of the LDQTED house crumbled, and
all the house vas found to’te in.a oimilar state of disrepair. Repairs and
Maited remodelling, tovever costly, did not seem to be econoaically
feasible, and in addition certain other operational and security considerations
Seewed to dictate the need for a new kind of structure--a higher building so
our angle of aurvélllonce ‘coiild-be improved, and the addition of a commercial
interest on the ground level to provide a daily flow of people (auch as a
bank, retail store, etc.) Srection of a comercial building is vithin the
soning restrictions of the district.

‘The cost for nev konstruction of a suitable building has been
estimated upwards.of $55,000, Although-the property io located in a slowly
deteriorating district, nonetheless. the proposition is bankeble. With land
included (appraiced at: $14,500 to $15,000), a local bank is willing to loon
80g of new construction cost vf “$55,000.

LIMOUSINE vould not venture into such’a:construction program on his
ovn decount at this tice. He voulg, hovever, follow through with it as sn
accosmodetion to KUBARK if the. terms were equitable. Accordingly, he has
indicated he will be‘'willing to~put up 20f of the construction cust froo his
own funds, borrow the remaining 50$, and then offered to pay KUBARK
180,600 pesés or $14,448 (appraised value by bank) for the 215 sq metres of
land. Nothing vould be paid for the old building, since little, 1f anything,
could be realized fro the sale of the old building and the cost of rezing it
would far exceed the:sale of the salvage materiols.

2B 7 fu

Bince much of LIMOUSINE's cash funds would be tied up in financing

the new constniction, he effered to effect payment to KUBARK at the rate of
4,300 peaca or $344.00 per month over @ 3} year period with the first payment
commencing 3 years after coapletion of coastruction or July 1905. LDXOUBINE
would execute # non-intéerest and unsecured. note for the land. Ho vould ensure
KUBARK tenancy retention Fights to rental of third floor spartment ot the rate.
