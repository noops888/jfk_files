CHANGES®

Operational As noted in the previous Request for Project Renewel,

tho formor LIMITED property was cold to Lecusus, wo as per forcal aree

ment with the Station, desolished the old structure and cons-ructed a new

edifice.

While it was tritially corte plated to place the LITTED

(ITE:"its -band?) perconnel in the ned building and to retain the cone,

equal division of workload between LILYUC and LITTED, it was later

aculued to nove the present LILYLIC basehouse personnel (LICTIYs-13, -14,

-26 and -27) Into the new baso instead, alons with the following ancillary

modificationo s

An Increase in the hours of both the photographic and phyoical surveillance

hours) durine the weekdays and to here the LinITED bace provide

photographic and physical curveillance coverage fron 1600-1930 hours

oi Weekdays and from 00201300 hours Or weekends, These changes were

dictated by the fóllowing considerations:

1.

The new IDicuSIn building offers a vuch better vantose polt

for both photographic and phycieel surveillanco than doos the

present comples nich houses the LILyIC and LINITED hases.

Thererore,

tho Station felt that the personnel occupying this

new base should be those porseseins the highest technleal skill.

and also those able to provide tre sost thorough and complete

coverase.

since the llllled bere now has only one traired

operator wille the LILYNIC bacchouse has three, the LILyuc grou

and

a revlison of working hours was indicated.

Because it was apparent that the coverase of the LIliCK

Inctallation sould de a lon: ra-re esd continuing requiresent,

the station desired to stali the row base viti perconnel of loni

rene potential, LInpry-o, sou alrost to yeers old, does not

3. Fliallo, the cocial end pirancial status of the illinic

Attached herewith ls a sterilized copy of the Memorandur

of Agreement executed with LIMOUSINE on 3 February 190% Both

Three

signed and dated coples are retalned In Statlon flles.

LIMOUSINE and his wife appeared and sighed the agreement, with

Robert L. EASBY acting for. O0YOKE. It will be noted that the final

torms were somewhat more favorable than

Headquarters had authorized.

Station had ample opportunity

so deat orom doen le operatica adving standpoint that

no e, and we forecasted compling can therefore be inalyo

begin almost at

Consideration had been given In the Station to installing

line-feed switchable transmitters In the two lower apartments in

probable etcract/veness to FUSTEAL personnel. However,

it Is Station's vlew that given LIMOUSINE's close Involvement with

of matters It would be well nelther to have too

nuch FJSTEAL Interest aroused in the bullding nor to give them the

opportunity to observe the sattern of LIFEUD/6 at such close range.

With reference to paragraph.5 of the memorandum, Station will

probably decide to have LIFEUD/6 draw up a normal contract with

LIMOUSINE and pay him his rent, which will be

passed by LIMOUSINE to

Station at regular Intervals.

The question of how to route an

apparently normal transaction around LIMOUSINE's bookkeeper has not

yet been resolved.

ATDE ANNOTRE

BUBICT Sole of LUTED Property to LINOUBINE

In 1959 KUnAR purchased the LDUTiD property (215 0g. notres of lond

and house) 1n Mexico City for 812,000 and then spent $3,500 for repgars an

renovations to secormodate KUBARS operational requiremento.

Because of Ita Ides? Loontion directly across the street Pron the

UBSR Sobassy, thia property which was for sale was purchased so KUBARK could

establish.control over this specific plece of property at that time.. For

restone of security, legal title for LAMITED wasveated in agent LACUSIN

who acted as tho cut-out vehicle.. A stateuent of trust is on file at thi

station in which LINOUBINE acknowledges XUBARK's true ownerahip of the

property.

"LIAITED bad been unid oporationally uita outataming success and

prèsumably sithout compromise, and 1t 1e WE's Intention to continue using

1t o

It recently developed that part of the IDITED houe crumbled, and

all the house was found

to be in a olnilar state of disrepali. Repaire and

Limited remodelling,

bovever costly, did not seem to be econoacally

feasible, and in addition cortain other operational and security considerations

scened to dictate the need for a sey kind of structure a higher building so

our angle of survelilance could be improved, and the addition of a commercial

Interest on the ground level to provide a dally flou of people (auch as a

bans, retail store, etc.) frection of a comercial building is vitin the

zoning restrictions of the dietriet.

The cost for new construction of a suitable bullding has been

estimated upwarde. of $55,000

Although. the property in located In a slovly

deteriorting district,

nonetheless the proposition in bankable. Hith land

Includod (appraiced at: $14,500 to $15,000), a local bank 10 v1111ng 80 1000

8oß of the new construction cost ue 855,000.

IDIOUSINE vould not venture Into such a construction progras on his

own account at this time. He would, however,

follow through with 1t 8s an

accommodation to KUBARi 1l the terma vere egulable. Accordingly, he baa

Indicated be will be willing to put up 20% of the conatruction cust from bie

own finds, borrow the remaining 80%, and then offered to pay KUMARK

180,600 penis or $14,448 (appraised value by bank) for the 215 8q matres of

land.

Nothing would be paid for the old building, alnce iittle, of anything,

could be realised fron the sale of the old bullding and the cost of ruzing it

would far erceed the sale of the salvage enterialo.

Since

much of lIMOUSINE's cash funds would be tied up in financing

tbe new contriction, he effered to effect payment to KUlARK at the rate of

4,300 penod or $344.00 per month over a 3ä year period with the firet paywent

commencing 3 years after coopletion of construction or July 1905. IDOLBINE

would execute a non-intérest and unsecured note for the land. do would ensure

CUBARK tenancy retention rigato to rental of third floor apartment at the rate.

of $2,300 pesos per month with AlBARK reserving theright. to cancel any time.

The apertment vould be built o KUEARK'@ reoulmamenta.
