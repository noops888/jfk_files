Concerning associates in New York City, informant
said that although ROSSELLI was with ORMENTO when they iast
met, ROSSELLI was never a close associate of ORMENTO, Instead,
in New York City, ROSSELLI was close to FRANK COSTELLO, THOMAS
LUCHESE , and VITO GENOVESE prior to the time VITO GENOVESE
pecame “boss of bosses".

Informant related the following story that
occurred while both were inmates in Atlanta, approximately
1S46-1947:

Informant said on one occasion, he told TOSSELLI that
he had a girl friend in New York City who was close to him but
since she only earned $40-$50.00 per week could not afford to
see him in Atlanta. Unbeknown to informant, ROSSELLI then
approached PETE DI PALERMO, also known as Petie Beck, brother
of JOSEPH and CHARLIE DI PALERMO, who was being discharged
from Atlanta Penitentiary and instructed that PETIE see THOMAS
LUCHESE and have LUCHESE give this girl money. Informant said
sometime thereafter this girl friend visited him in Atlanta
and explained that she had been given $300.00 and was receiving
$50.00 per week from informant's "friends".

. Informant recalled that on one occasion during this
period, ROSSELLI had told him that WILILIE MORETTI, also

oe

known as Willie Moore, characterized as "an Eastern representative

for the RICCA family and ROSETTI's contact man, was "blowing
his top" and was telling people of his association with
ROSELLI, which upset ROSSELLI. Informant said a few years
subsequent to this, WILLIE MORETTI was murdered by an
ANASTASIA “soldier", JOHN ROBILOTTO, also known as Johnny
Roberts, who himself was subsequently murdered during the
period when ANASTASIA and his “underboss", TOMMY RAVA were
killed.

Informant said he recalled that ROSELLI was also
closely associated with MIKE COPPOLA in Miami, Florida, as
well as "FAT TONY" SALERNO, Informant said that ROSSELLI was
also close with the MASSI (ph) brothers who wield considerable
LCN power in Cleveland, Ohio, and with JOHNNY MITCHELL, true
name unknown, who was an LCN. member from Chicago, but now
resides in Miami. Informant stated that the attorney previously
mentioned by him is definitely JOSEPH BULGER and was certain of
the fact that ROSSELLI on more than one occasion had advised
him that BULGER was an LON "soldier" from Kansas City.
