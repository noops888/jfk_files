In a letter dated 29 July 1965 to the president of the Movimiento

Miami, the Puerto Rico delegation of tho MDC set forth its
views on what it considered a "conspiracy of silence” against -
Christian Democracy, It felt that the movement was being
harmed by deliberate distortion of facts, and that. the cam-
paign was intensified by. Chilean President Eduardo Frei ;
Montalva's trip through Europe. The delegation took exception ©
to statements, about Cuba made by Frei, whom they considered
ill-informed, The delegation did not feel that public state~
ments should be made on this matter, but warned that Cubans
should be alert concerning Frei, The delegation suggested

that Frei should be censured by the national executive com~ |

According to the letter, “the national executive committee of

Since Frei's. inaiiguration in. Novenbér 1964, the MDC has been »
inquiring ‘about..the.Chilean Government's attitude toward

plexity of-the internal situation in Chile and because he
vould not act unilaterally in hemispheric mattéers,. They.
claim that the statements attributed to Frei concerning Cuba
are loose quotations from ‘speeches, intended for internal

by the préss,' The letter continued, that it was not advisable |
to take a public stand against the statements attributed to

Froi as that would lead-to a public debate with’ the PDC and
as a result. would place other parties of the Christian
Democrat Orgiinization of America (ODCA) in a position of
having to support one or the other. :

The letter said that the MDC must gather documentation on what
Frei has said and written concerning Cuba, and assigned this
task to the Puerto Rico delegation, This documentation could
be studied at the noxt national congress, and from this
documentation it might be possible to develop a good defense
for Christian Democracy and the MDC, It warned that this
problem must be bandied with self-control and without enotion,

Even though the MDC does not: like Frei's position, he is the

first Christian Democrat to. be elected president in, the
‘continues.

to gain in stature internationally, Also, he shows respect
‘and sympathy toward the MDC, He is a responsible person and
is not pro-Communist nor does he sympathize with the regime
of Fidel Castro Ruz. It would be a disservice to Cuba and to
the MDC if a split were provoked between the MDC and the PDC

pereanally.. On the contrary, the solution to
the problem is a rapprochement because the MDC has faith in
the PDC to understand the MDC's viewpoints when they are 7
presented clearly. .

In a letter dated 24 August 1965 to the president of the MDC,
Enrique Villareal do la Concepcion, MDC delegate in Chile,
said that he had received notice from Laureano Batista Falla,
secretary of delegations of the MDC, that he (Villareal)
would not represent ‘the MDC at the ODCA meeting in Venezuela
from 12 to 14 August because he worked in thé international
department of the PDC. He said that he had decided to resign
from the MDC and continue his work in Chile and his work for
the Latin American Confederation of Christian Sindicalists.

A member of a group of Cuban emigres trained in the techniques

ports since 1961.

The Ninth Congress of the Movimiento Democrata Cristiano (upc,
Christinn Deyocratic Movement) was held in Miami from 27 to 29
August 1965." There. was little enthusiasm at the Congress: as a
result of the dissatisfaction of the MDC with the Christian *
Democratic moverent in Latin America, and the fact that an in=
creasing number of members of the MDC identify themselves with,
and support the foreign policy of, the United States,

It was decided at the Congress that the National Executive will
be elected for a one-year term, starting with the election of
February 1966. -The National Executive elected at the Congress
for the period fron September 1965 to February 1966 is composed
of the following: | 7

A° young Cuban @xile who has beon‘trainod in information colloction,
His past reporting has beon accurate but lecks depth. This
information was obtaincd from a member of the KDC,

On 8 April 1965, Otto Hoyer, foreign relations secretary of tho
Chilean Christian Democratic Party, arrivod in Miami, Florida,

for a ono-day interview with mombers of tho. national exccutive
committee of the Hovimiento Democrata Cristiano (MC, Christian
Democratic Movement), Juan Manucl Salvat Roque, leador of the
Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE, Students" Revolutionary
Directoratc), was present for the intervicw, Coyer had just

spont more than 30 days touring Central Amorican eountries in an
effort to make direct contact with Christian Democratic Partios

in that area.

After his. introduction, Boyor bricfly ¢cscribed the history of
the Chilean Party from the day it was foundod 30 years ago until
ite riso to power in 1964 with tho election to tho presidency of

Eduardo Freie

During the course of tho interview, Loycr entertained polite but
energetic questions fron various members of the MDC, When he was
asked why President Frei wanted to ve ‘commercial relations with
the Communist countries, Loyer attempted to explain that tho
decision was not based on idoology but on economics, Ho said that
Chile has a great neod for hard currency und that if. the United |
States can maintain commercial relations with the Communist
countries; why can Chilo not do so algo. One of the HDC members
remarked that by going to such an cxtrene, the Chileans were H
bohaving like “Bnglishmen,” and that it was immoral to establish H
relations based on such excuses.

Boyer wag then asked if he bolieved in the solidarity of
Christian democracy. Ho said that ho did but added that to
him the solidarity of Christian democracy in Latin America was

\ ‘i
The dolesation from:New York, composed of Cuarione Diaz Martinez

and Victor Batista Falla, did not arrive uotil 21 February.

iuiberto Perez Herrera prescited the report of tho Puerto Rican
delecation, the highlights of which were as follows:

a, The activities of the MDC, delegation in Puerto Rico de=

| creased. considerably during the past six nonths, This,

‘he claimed, was due to the problens of the Christian”
Democrats in Chile and to ‘the position talen by Eduardo _
-Frei, President. of Chile,

b,..The public activities of the MDC, such as the celebration
of the anniversary of Jose lartils birthday and the houage
paid tp the Venezuéian portworkers for their boycott of
ships trading with Cuba, as well as the caupaign in favor
of a Cuban Government in Lxile, had holped to overcore much
of tho stagnation of the HDC in Puerto Rico,

c,. The Puerto Rican delegation differs from the Miami delegation
in that it is made up of Cuban exiles of a higher financial
standing tlian that of the averago Cuban oxile residing in
Miomwi, The wembers of the Puorto Rican delegation contribute
one percent of tioir incoue to the ycC,

d, ‘The MDC is concerned over the. penetration of the Conuunist
._Party in. the university and other centers of higher learning
“and some of the terrorist activities of the Communists.

The MDC is also concerned over the attitude of the press
regarding the terrorist activities and feels that the. press

has pro~Communist leanings,

Later in the same session Perez spcke of the great value of
the Juventud Democrata Cristiana (JDC, Christian Democratic
Youth) of Cuba in Puerto lico and gave high praise to Monteliu
and Patterson. However; when there vas a discussion in the
Congross ubcut outlawing the Communist Party in a free Cuba,
tlonteliu and Patterson said the Party should be recognized
as-a logal party and should be allowed to engage in public
activities, When certain members of the Miawd delegation
opposed this, Honteliu and Patterson accused the Miani dole~

gation of being fascist.

The report of the Mexican delegation was presented by Carmen
de Guzman and included the following points:

a. The Mexican delegation has 42 members, Nelations between

the different groups of Cuban exiles in Mexico are cordial;

- patriotic and public events are usually celebrated jointly.

b, The delegation 4s developing a plan for the establishment
of radio courses about Christian Democratic doctrine,
Similar to those already established in Colombia and ‘
Vonduras, As a result of. arrangonents wade by the ‘fexican.
delegation, it was possible to have a two-hour weel:ly .
course on Christian economic doctrine given at the School
of Economy of the University of Hexico, where a three-
hour. course in i#arxisu is now being given,

c. Popular feeling in iexico, regarding the Cuban cause is favor~

ablo except auong teachers and educators; this group is

deeply penetrated by the Communist Party, Some favorable
change in the attitude of the press has been noted, especially
