Summary.

Correspondence between the MDC in Miami and the MDC

delogation in Puerto Rico, and a letter from Enrique Villareal

de la Concepcion, MDC roprosentative in Chile, indicated a

difforence of opinion within the organization concerning the

MDC's views regarding tho Chilean Christian Democratic Party

and Eduardo Frei Montalva, President of Chile.

It felt that the novement was belng

agreed

with

tbe Puerto Rico delegation's concern about

the

hostility toward the MDC in the press,

and in political and

roligious circles, which it said was

more intense in Miami

than in Puerto RiCO.

Cho letter pointed out, however united

thore has been a noticeable chango in the attitude of

States Goverment officials toward the MDC; that the MDC is

treated with more respect and consideration. This was

attributed to the growing importance of Christian Democracy

in Intornational relations,

duo to Frei's triumph and his

/ policy of

"hemisporte transcendence."

According to the letter, the national executive committee of

the MDC has been

observing Frei's

actions with, growing alarm.

claim that the staterents attributed to Frol concerning Cuba

are loose quotations from speeches, intended for

consumption which are exaggerated

or quoted out of contert

by the press.

The letter continued.

that it was not advisable

to take a publie stand against the statements attributed to

Frol as that would lead to a public debate with the PDC and

as a result would place other parties of the Christian

Denocrat Organization of America (ODCA) in a position of

having to support one or the other.

The letter said that the MDC must gather documentation on what

Frel has said and written concerning Cuba, and assigned this

to the Puerto Rico delegation.

documentation could

be studied at the next national congress, and from this

documentation it might be possible to develop a good defense

for Christian Democracy and the MDC.
