of planning, of approvals, or of teeeenee etna: ‘The few written
records that do exist are either largely tangential to the pain
events or vere put on paper from menory years afterward. Willies
Sarvey has retaized skeletal notes of his activities during the
years in question, and they are our best cource of dates. Dr.
Edvard Gunn, of the Office of. Medical Services, has & record of
whos he net ent when acd czyptic references to the subjects discussed.

because they give dates of neetings, the substances of which may be

inferzed froa collatere} information. :

For the most part, though, we have kad to rely on information

mong the vartous accounts, but most of thes can be resolved by
collating the inforzation furnicked by all of the identifiable
participants in a particular plan and by then checking it egaiast
specific dates’that can be fired with fair certainty. We believe

thet this reccastruction of vhat happened and of the thinking
associated with {t fs reasouably sound. If there are significant .
inaccuractes in the report, they are most likely to occur in faulty

through O'Connell that the operation ves off--even if something

Willieg Harvey, Catef of FI/D, was triefed in Febrvary 1961
(vy authority of Richard Bissell) on ptase ore of the gambling
syndicate operation.” That briefing vas in connection with a sensitive
operation that Bissell had assigned to Esrvey. Earvey describes it
thus: Early in the Kennedy aduinictration, Bissell called him in to

discuss vbat Barvey refers to as an Executive Action Capability; L.e.)

@ general stand-by capability to carry out assassinations vhen required.

Harvey's motes quote Bissell as cayins, “Ske White House has twice
urged me to create such a capability." Bissell recalls d'scussirg

the question of developing a general capability vith Harvey. He

mentioned the Edvards/gambling syndicate operation against castro
in that context, but he nov thinks that the operation was over by
then and that reference to it was in ters of a past operation as a
case in point. Te vas on this baste that Harvey arranged to be
briefed by Réverds. Harvey's fixing of the date as February vas only
. efter review of ewcnts both preceding the briefing and folloving tt.
He saya nov that 1t might have been/esrly as late Jemary or as late
as Varch 1961. : .
After sone discussion of the probleas involved fa developing an
Executive Action Capability, Bissell placed Barvey in charge of the
effort. Harvey seys that Bissell had already discussed certain aspects

If the inforzation given the Bureau is as limited as the records,

‘ and our faformation {ndicate, then the Bureau has not been informed,
as the Attorney General was, that the Agency was tizst unvitting and
thea a reluctant accessory after the fact. It vould be surprising,

though, if the Bureau does not now knov the whole story of the Las

Vegas bugging incident. Whether the Bureau may now think that CIA was
less than candid about the bugging incident (ae distinguished fron tke

sensitive assassination operation) is a question for speculation.

Avgust_ 1 te:

What is available to the press is undoubtedly available to the
” Bureau. In fact, some indication of the extent of the Bureau's
Imowledge is found in a feature story in the Chicago Sun-Tizes of
16 August 1963, with a Washington date line, under the banner lead:

* "GIA SOUGHT GIANCAHA HELP FOR CUBA SPYTHG"
” ghe article cites “Justice Department sourced’ as expressing the belief
‘that Giancena never did any spying at all for the CIA. He merely
pretended to go along with the CIA: EE

“in the hope that the Justice Department's drive to put hin
behind bars might be sloved - or at least affected - by his
ruse of co-operetion with enother govercment ageacy."

‘The story places the period of the relationship from 1959 to:



13-00000

“cone tize in 1960, lexg tefore the eborcive revel
nw sion at the Bay of Pigs in April, 1951."

Tee neuspayer then gives the followlag version of the bugging incident:

"

“an equally bizarre episode months later gave the
Justice Department its first clue to Glancana's
negotiations with the CIA. E

“The figures in this incident vere e cale night-
club entertainer ard Giancaza‘s girl friend,
Phyliis McGuire, one of the singing McOuire
sisters.

"At the tine, in Giancena's opinion, the entertainer
vas overly uttentive to Miss McGuire.

"At Las Vegas, Nev., in 1961, sheriff's police
seized a provler in the entertaizer's hotel suite.
Yor hours, the intruder refused to identify himself
or say he vas rifling the entertainer's rooms.

- 7
Cian “Persistent questioning by sheriff's deputies, siisitte

according to federal authorities, led to an if .

admission by the provler that ke vas on the

* payroll of a private detective agency in Florida.

“Florida authorities sought an explanation of the ieee Oa
Aineident from the operator of the detective agency.

At first, the operutor refused to discuss the

watter. Pisally, hovever, he told favestigators

to get in touch vith the CIA. A

far “The inquiry then shifted frou Florida to Washington
: and revealed Glancara's negotiations with CIA, H
it was disclosed. u : 7 ; '

"Goverment sources reported Thursday that the
private investigator's mission in the Las Vegas
suite of the entertainer wes another riddle of the
Giencana caper with the CIA. Neither CIA nor the
Florida detective Agency ever has offered an
explanation of what the investigator was doing in

2 At about the tise of the Donovan-Castro negotiations for the

releese of the Bay of Pigs prisoners a plan was devised to have
Donovea present & contantaated sxin diving suit to castro as a gift.
me Castro was know to be a skin diving eathusiast. We cannot put @

Precise cate ca this scheme. Desmond FitzGerald told us of it as if

it bad originated after ke took over the Cuba tasx force in January

1963. Samvel Balpera said that it began undar Wilitom Tarvey and ;

that he, Ealpern, briefed FitzGerald oa it. Esrvey states positively ‘

that he never heard of it. i - \

According to Sidney Gottlieb, this schene progressed to the -

"point of actually buying a diving sult and readying it for delivery.

The technique involved dusting the inside of the suit with a fungus
that vould produce a disabling and chronte skin disease (Madura foot)

* ena contaminating the breathing apparatus with tubercle bacillt.

Gottlieb does not eaenber what came of the scheme or vhat happened

_ to the scuba mult. San Halpern, vii wis ta oa the schene, at first : i
said the plan was dropped because Lt was obvicusly impracticable. :
He later recalled that the plan was ebandoned because it was overtaken

by events: Donovan had elresdy given Castro a skin diving cult on his

own initiative. The schene ray have been nentioned to Mike Miskovsky,

Bocby-tranped Sea Shell

Sone tine 12 1953, date uncertain but p: ably carly in the
year, Desrond FitzGerald, then Chief, SAS, originated @ schexe for
doing avay with Castro by reaas of an explosives-rigged sea shel.
The idea vas to take an unusually spectacular sea ‘chell that outa .
be certain to catch Castro's eye, load 1+ with an explosive triggered
to blow vhea the shell vas lifted, and submerge 1t in an area viere
Castro often vent skin diving.

Des bougat two books on Caribbean Mollusca. The scheme vas soon
found to be impracticable. None of the shells that might conceivably
be found in the Caribbean area was both spectacular exough to be sure
of attracticg attention and large enough to hold the needed volime
of explosive. The widget subsarine that vould have had to be used
in emplacement of the shell has tco short un operating range for such
an operation.

FitzGerald states that he, Sam Halpern, and Bruce Cheever had
several sessions at vhich they explored this possibility, but that no

one else was ever brought in on the talks. Ealpern believes that he
had conversations with TSD on feasibility asd using a hypothetical —
case. Ee does not xesenber with vhoa ke my have spoken. We are
unable to identify any others who nev of the schene at the time it

was beirg coasidered.

mF " ais seems cleariy to point the finger at Roselli as the ulticate

aie source of the information oa the cenbling syadicate plot and to
coafim Morgan as Pearson's source.
ee

We can test the accuracy of this assimption ageiast analysis ve

had done earlier in an effort to identify the lizely source of

Pearson's story. Ca we opposite page is a listing of persons
definitely known *> be witting of certsin key facts nov in Pearson's
Possession. The list includes CIA officers vio nev more than one
of the kay facts, plus oll inom outeiders. ‘These vere our
conclusions: * : . :

a. If Drew Pearson has a single source, and if Pearson's
: famediate source 1s the ultinate source of the leak, and if

7 pron

coupartzentation was not violated, then Bill Earvey exerges
as the Likely candidate. - He wis the ouly persoa ve found in

the course of this inguiry vho knev all four of the key facts
at fhe tine the Pearson colums appeared. We preferred not to

" to lesk it avcidentally. Further, if he vere the source, ve
could expect Pearson's story to be cucpletely a=curate, because ©

Earvey knew the truth. :

bit b. If we ruled out Zarvey as the source, then it apzeured ——-
that there oust be at least tvo ultizate gources of leaks. ‘The
State Departrent meeting was not known to any of the other

participants in the operation--aszuming that Harvey did not

mention it to any of thes. Therefore, Lt is quite possible
that the leak on the State Department meeting bas come frou
soweone who bas no direct knoviedge of the gambling syndicate
~ operation but does know of the meeting.

oN

c. From the standpoint of who-lnev-what, the next most i
Mxely source of the origiral leak is Jotm Roselli. He is, in — |
fact, the only person vith direct an? continuous participation
throughout both phases of the ganbling syndicate operation. He
introduced Maheu to Sam Glancena as the firot step in getting

vo

the operation under way, and he vas the one vho made the final ~ ‘

everything that went on with the gengsters, with Orta, acd vith
