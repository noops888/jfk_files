REF: ODACID Ciudad Trujitlo Despatch Ko. 53, dated July 23, 1955, and its
attachnent Menorant=n of July. 13, 1956, concerning Semtor Rolando
MASFERRER and his newspaper TMezpo en Cubs

1e Chief of Station invites Headquarters‘ close scrutiny of the
we awl eee wees, Guuavur muisnao BADrsaNex OF Cuba and his
newepaper Tieapo en Cuba.

2. The impression (CS has derived of Semtor Zolanio Masferrer fran
referenced reports is that there is a strong possibility that he is a "Trojan
Eorse" for the extrene left and probably the Communists, despite the fact that
his trouble-saiing periodical (subsidised by the Cctan Goverment) my be *
"a heavy user of USIS mterial*.

3. Where acd when was opportunist Rolando Masferrer winking t to risk his
career for an "ideal"? According to reference it was as a Commmist fighting
for the so-called "Loyalist" cause in Spain. Does it necessarily mean any
thing that Masferrer now *zrofesses aiti—Comunism with a‘vengeance"? Is
Masferrer_a broad-ninded, levol-headsd, and judicicis "whig?? Certainly be
does not appear to be such fron the account of hin siven in reference. He
would appeer to ce anything but a weli-talanced, cocservative, Republican (in
the technical and non-partisan sense of the word).

4. Masferrer appears to COS to be a Jacobin, a demagog, a tyrant, and
aa extrenist—snd probably a Leftist extrenist—who is attenpting to sway the -
course of BATISTA's policies.

5. It 4s of Saportance to note that'as of 13 dcly 1956 St was roported
4n reference that Hasferrer “currently 19 attempting to gain’ control of Cuban
labor®, Were Senitor Masferrer to obtain such control, 003 feels he would be
& definite danger in Cuba and possibly in the Caribbean,

6. Wore COS convinced that Hasferrer 1s nerely an opportunist, he would
not have bothered to write this dispateh. COS is of the studied opinion that
Masferrer has adopted the anti-Coummist line sclely for the purpose of staying

fon the battleground

on the battleground until it suits his purposes to desert the anti—Commmist

cause at the most critical moment possible. Until anti-Coammism becaxe

popular about 1950 and 1951, Semtor Masferrer, as indicated by reference,

enjoyed reviling the United States, its people, and its policies. :

7. What are Generalissino TRUJILLO's attitudes toward Masferrer, Batista,
and Cuba? Trujillo's thought processes lea~ him to the pailosophy that "if
you re not with us you are against us". Since Trujillo's line, sixply, is
thie: Catholicism, nationalisa, aryanism, conscrvatisn, hispsnicisa, tradi~
tionalien, anti-Commnism, and cooperation, generally, with a United States
which recognises the scvereigxt7 end culture of hispanic-inerican mttona,
Trujillo rescnts Batista's tolerating the enemies of his ideal, Trujiilo has
hoped to enlist Batista iu the "Concert of the Caribbean" and to have him
squelch the Dominican exiles and che Camunists. If Trujillo did attespt t

antiCommunism ara possibly hoped to use him as an infleence upon latista's

: policies. It is hard to believe that Generalissimo. Trujillo would be likely

: to team up with a Carlos PRIO Socarras. Is there definite evidence tat he
has in the past?

8, Possibly Trujillo bluniered in nis approach to Masferrer. He often
blunders because he is susceptible to flattery ih regard to nis grand schemes.
Could it be possible that Masferrer initiated the Trujille action through his
adopting the anti-Communist position? That position attract- Trujillo like
a bee to honey. Trujillo, lize Bolivar, leves the role of a Jefenier of America.
Despite his many weaimesses, ie is often sincere in taking ewt jpositi
Some persons call it aegalomnia. However, megalomania in atself is not abays
ted. It can be used to advantage by a United States seeking unity, peace,

” and cooperation on its southern marches. Trujillo has zany faults, but he is
@ partisan of order and he hates chaos. Trujillo hates leftism because it
brings chaos and mics the tesk of conscientious leaders, at tines, inpossible.
