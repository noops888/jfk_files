KUSFERRER and his nerspaper Ileapo en Cribe

Lo The Chief of Station Invites Headquarters' close scrutin of the

newspaper Tienpo en Cuba.

The Impression US bas derived of Senator Zolando Masferrer fron

referenced reports is that there is a strong possibility that be 19 a "Trojan

Sorse" for the extrene left and probably the Committs, despite the fact that

his trouble raiding periodical (subsidised by the Caban Coverment) usy be

"a heavy user of USIS material".

Where ard when vas opportunist Rolando Hasferrer willing to risk his

carer for an riesli? iccording to reference it iig as a Coumnist fighting

for the so-called "Loyalist" cause in Spain. Does it necessarily men ary

thing that Masferrer now "professes anti-Communisn with a vengeanca"? Is

Nasferrer & broad-ninded, levol-headst, and judicing hig? Certainly be

does not appear to be such tron the account of bim given in reference.

rouid apper to so anything but a wali-balanced,

cosservative, Republican (In

the technical and non-partisan sense of the word).

A. Masterrer appear- to COS to be a Jacobin, a desagog, a tyrant, and

no extrenist and probably a leftist extrenist iho is astempting to sway the

course of BArISta's policies.

It 1s of importanco to note that as of 13 july 1956 1t ras gyport ed

In reference that Hasferrer "eurrently is attempting to gain control of Caban

labor".

Were Semitor Masterrer to obtain such control, COS feels he would be

a dafinite danger 1n Cuba and possibly in the Caribbean.

Wore COs convinced that Hasferrer is herely an opportunist, he would

not have bothered to write this dispatch.

COS 1s of the studied opinion that

Masferrer has adopted the anti-Coumnist. Iine solely for the purpose of staying

Il Trujillo did atreapt to

policies. It Is hard to bellere that Generalissimo. Irujillo would be likely

to team up with a Carlos PRIO Socarras. Is there definite evidence tat he

has in the past?

8.

Possibly Irujillo blundered in nis approach to Fasferrer. Ee often

blunders because he is suscepzible to flattery in regard to his grand schemes.

Could It be possible that Masferrer initiated the Trujillo action through his

adopting thr anti-founist position? That position attrae: - Irujillo 11ke

a bee to honey. Trujillo, like Bolivar, lores the role of a defenier of America.

Despite his many veinesses, ie is oiten sincere in taxing sui pusicini.

Some persons call it megalonania.

However, megaloania in Itself 1s not allays

ode. It can be used to advantage by a United States seeking unity, peace,

and cooperation on its southern narches. Trujillo has sany faults, but he is

& partisan of order and he hates chaos.

Trujillo hates leftism because it

brings chaos and mies the tsk of conscientious leaders, at times, inpossible.
