THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter IL, CSHB 70-1-1, 27 October 1966

1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those eatenories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and *
CL investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence bas accumulated.

2 THE 201 SYSTEM

‘The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, Le. 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that
individual,

b. The 201 Dossier: thé official file containing the 201 opening form (Form
“ 831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, ie., per-
sonal history, current status, and prospects. *

c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of
2.201 file, This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

a. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lincs will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated. : :

e. Ol Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-
sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual
with organizations or activities of operational interest. Of codes cover intelli-
gence and sccurity service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or
suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest. There are two cutegories of OL
codes for use Ly components:

(1) general OI codes (Attachment 4)
(2) OF codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services
or other specific organizations.

A component may request an OI code be established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management
Officer.

‘A201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An OI code may be assigned
when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see
paragraph 3) below) by filling in Bo 19 or 2 code may be assigned or added
at a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

‘The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201
personalities by OI codes. For example, if an OI code has been opened for the
security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members
‘of that service. .

£. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on
or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers

exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER
a. General

‘The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-
ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates
& master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing
‘of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be
opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter Il of this
handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information
will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are oj on
persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-
sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those
persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals
are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff
employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

persons who are only of local interest to a field station of Headquarters desk
and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO
records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-
ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose
names appear in incoming dispatches. These’ are listed in Attachment 2 201
dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

(2) Subjects of provisional operational approval and Sissy ap-
proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested
for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera
tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests 201 opening.

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than
denied area countries, in close association with stalf personnel.

4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

* (5) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals inforination in five ©

or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/
ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).

b. Requesting 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out t and submitting
2 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-
tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the
master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-
ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample
201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field
station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-
quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after the
subfect’s name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening,
is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by
placing 201- after the term “File” on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN
will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-
bility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of
201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

(5) Occupation. oe sie :
‘These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,
a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the
Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be
produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915
and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the
United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.
Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with 2n
OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other than AA and those
with no OI code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that
persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also
that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific
as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupstion code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one”

‘occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice
some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters, bricklayers, painters, mechanics
