THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-1; 27 October 1968

1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in.

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various calegories of information abut them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those calmories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2 THE 201 SYSTE.!

The principal features of the 201 system are:

& The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1231567, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form

831) and all biograpbic reporting on and references to the individnal, ie, per-

sonal history, current states, and prospects.

c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of

& 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference lor the Main Indes and

stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved for special listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be mored up and the ref-

erence consolidated

3 OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

=. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-

ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Croup. An opening creates

& master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing

of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISC. 201 dossiers may be

opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapier Il of this

handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information

will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on

persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-

sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those

persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals

are reguested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on staff

coployees, staff agents and most catezories of coniraci employees. Files on

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO

records system and are to be maintained by shat unit. Some destis lery require

ments on ISC for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose

names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Altachment 2 201

dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-

proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested

for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-

tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities; bonafide diplomats of other than

denied area countries, in close association with stalf personnel.

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

(5) Persons on whom a Sain Inder search reveals inforination in five

or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from ISN/

ISR (opened only by IP/RVS).

b. Requesting & 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting

a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-

tenance Section (IP/R.MS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the

master 201 record and 201 machine listings

and to register the assign-

ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of saliple

201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 20l's. A field

station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-

quarters file or cross-reterence box on the dispatch form and/or alter the

subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening

is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by

placing 201- after the term "File" on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN

vill open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the respons

ility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified o

201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

a Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the dest olficer. le requires

discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the

simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it will therefore take

place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be done

periodically. A 201 dussier heing forwarded to Central Files for relention should

be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, le., exact copy (5) of a document.

(2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for

the opening.

(3) All abstract slips.

(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

(5) The disseminated version of positive intelligence information it

a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number

then must be transferred to the firse page of the ras report.

(8) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch

cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations or comments,

(7) Record copy documents which only repeat substantive information

contained in other documents in the file; authorization fur destruction is

by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier

fonvarded to Central Files; the document must be doingraded for setention

in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized

officer in the originating office or the Records Olficer having jurisdiction

over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification

authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained

at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be remored, retained

in a desk TS file or forvarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a

cross-reference sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the location

of the IS document

(9) Deferred documents (see 5b(2)).

b. Maintenance Procedures

(1) All material in a 201 dossier will be filed in document date order.

• (2) Deferred documents will not be filed in a 201 dossier. If they are

to be retained in the dossier they should be sent to IP/RNS for classification

into that 201.

(3) Field index cards (held by some desks) and area desk cards may

be retained in the 201 as part of a consolidation procedure. These cards

should be mounted on a full-size sheet of paper for filing in the 201.

(4) A 201 dossier previously opened on a person who becomes a staff

employee and which contains Record Copy documents will be restricted to

the ISG/DIP unless the desk retains the restriction. The dossier should be

closed if there are no Record Copy documents in it

(5) A 201 opened in pseudonym should be consolidated into the true

name 201 if one exists or converted lo the true name.

(6) Field and duplicate (shados) 201 files no longer of active interest

should be incorporated into the official 201 after the duplicate material

has been purged by the desk officer and the remaining information classified

to that 201 by she Analysis Section (IP/AN).

(7) Any document with a predecessor organization cover sheet or an

OPC (Office o! Policy Coordination) cover sheep from the Archives and

Disposition Section (IP/ARD) must be returmed to IP/ARD for processing

to the 201.

containing substantive or derogatory information on the subject of the 201

should be sent to IP/AN to be classified officially into the 201 file.

(9) An attachment which should be separated from its basic document

for inclusion in a 201 personality dossier will be forsarded with the basic

document to IP/AY for processing into the 201.

All standard listings are cumuntive; previous editions inust be elestroyed

upon recript of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremsly

sensitise compilations of information and must be given every possible saleguard.

b. Y'on-Standard Listings

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:

(1) Country of location

(2) OI codes (organization and/or intelligence affiliation)

(3) Citizenship

(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)

(5) Occupation.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have ben assigned the

Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

procluced of all persons who sere bom in Germany between the years 1915

and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the Ol code AA

Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

O1 code AA. Those personalities with an Ol code other than AA and those

with no OI code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigaed an OI code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specifie

as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation rede for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice

some trade or manual occupation, i.e, carpenters, bricklayers, painters, mechanics

and elestricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this category

will be includer in the printout. These non-standard listings may be sorted

..(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords:
