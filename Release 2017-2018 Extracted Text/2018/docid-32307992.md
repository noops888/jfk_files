Re Buairtel to Miami, 9/7/67.

The Bureau points out, in reairtel, as to certain

discrepancies contained in information furnished by the

captioned informant. One of these is the fact that PAUL

VARIO was identified by the informant as one of those in

attendance at meetings held in presence of the informant

in New York.

Bureau refer to Miani airtel under captioned

matter dated 8/21/67, page 3, paragraph 1. Thenin it 1a

stated by the informant chat VARIO had at one time been a

member of the BONANNO faully, but was shifted to the LUCHESE

family and was made a "captain" by LUCHESE.

caption A cost NeSe A CONSTER a a 9/6/ in one

was ze-interviewed concerning that information fumished

on 9/4/67, relating to his trip to N. Y.

Informant stated

that this trip was not to be coustrued as a "nesting" with

all persons in attendance at the same time. He states that

any misconception would have been his fault, that he was

"ummoned" to New York by PAUL VARIO for a two-fold purpose,

number one being to re-finance informant for monetary set-

backe ineurred during recent court trials, and number two, to

bring informant up to date as to recent occuzzences in the

LCN, particulazly with regard to the BONANNO fantly. The

situation with that regard was furnished to the Bureau and

New York in the airtel mentioned above.

The informant insists that the iniciation ceremony

ascribed to LCN membership by other acmitted Lal nembeze was

not the case in his situation and re-iterates that this

ceremony, although in existance at one time, was not given

to him, and at the time of his admission, according to the

informant, the ceremony was passe'.

Regarding execution squads set up by BONANNO

throughout the country as set forth in Miami airtel to Bureau

8/21/67, the informant has no further details relating to

this at this time, however, he did explain that he had learned

during his trip to New York that these people had been "paid

off" by the other factions to disclaim their loyalty to

BONANNO to the point that they were no longer considered a

threat, at least as was related to the informant by VARIO.

In connection with the development of this informant,

as has been noted through experience with informants in

general, a complete picture of information furnished is

generally gained through a series of interviews and is particularly

true in this case.

This informant is not of a nature to be

"grilled" at length at any one confrontation. The interview

wich him usually lasts no longer than an hour at a sitting

and sone times less. At this stage of his development, the

informant retains a certain reticence towazd conterences

with law enforcement personnel. It is expected that, with

proper development of confidence between Agent and informant,

these natural barziers will dissolve.

The next interview with the informant is scheduled

for about the end of this week, at which time some of the

questions put forth by the Bureau in rebuairtel will be

attempted to be resolved.

The above-captioned source should be intervieved in

detail regarding his knowledge of La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

activity in an effort to obtain olaritying data with respect

to information he has previously furnished regarding this

underworld organtzation.

This source has reported that he was "made" a member

of the Bonanno "fanily" approximately 20 years ago, bowever, he

stated there was no initiation cerenony involved in connection

with his induction. It is noted that his account of beconing

a member of the Bonanno #family" substantially differe fron

that furnished by other bureau sources who are members of the

Bonanno "Zanily." These sources have advised there was a

fornal ceremony at the time they becane full-fledged members.

The Bureau's experience in connection with the

development of member-informants in UCh discloses that gone o1

those sources are initially reluctant to provide intimate

details of their initiation, however, with additional well-

planned interviews, these source have furnished couplete

intornation regarding the speeifie circunstances existing when

they becane members of LCN:

Miant airtel to the Bureau and New York dated 9/5/67,

entitled "La Cosa Nostra, Al = Conspiracy" advises the

informant furnished inforation regarding an LCN neeting which

he attended on Long Island, New York. This source reported

approximately 13 members of the Bonanno and Gambino "fanilies"

were in attendance. Among those he identified were Paul Vario

and Carmine Tramuntl. It is noted Bureau sources have

previously reported these two individuals are members of the

Luchese "fanily." The informant should be pressed for full

details regarding this meeting, including its exact location

and identity of all in attendance.

MM 1231-C-TE has also stated that Joe Bonaano

maintained "execution squads" throughout the country and

specifically in Los Angeles, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Chicago,

and elsewhere, The informant should be interviewed in detail

concerning this situation in an effort to obtain complete

details.

It is recognized that the informant, as a veteran

hoodlum, has an exceptional potential to assist the Bureau.

Intervows with him should be aimed at obtaining very precise

Information regarding his knowledge and possible involvenent

in LCH activity.

In reporting the results of the interview of MY 3231-C-TK

concerning this matter, designate copies for Bureau file 92-6054,

"La Cosa Nostra, AR + Conspiracy," and the New York Office.
