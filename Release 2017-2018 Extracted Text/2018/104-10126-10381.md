SUBJECT : The Photo of an Unidentified Individual in the Warren
Commission Report: A Factual Chronological Survey

REFERENCE: Memorandum by David W. Belin to Mr. £. Harry Knoche,
15 April 1975 (Attachment, A)

1. Reference memorandum suggests it would be appropriate to
reconsider full disclosure at this time of the circumstances and factual
data relative to the Subject. The purpose of this survey is to permit a

realistic evaluation of the suggestion.

Background

2. This examination and summary of the record concerns a cropped

photograph considered by the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy (hereinafter cited as the Warren Commission) and

1
introduced into evidence as Odum Exhibit No. 1. The photograph

(together with others of the same individual) originated from a highly

CIA and Mexican security authoritie$§ against the Soviet and Cuban

Embassies in Mexico City.
hon

, 3. Under the extraordinary press of effort to develop information
on the assassin and the assassination, copies of the photograph were
made available by CIA's Mexico Station Chief on the afternoon of
22 November to the local FBI representative, and later that day,
asserted ly on the decision of the Ambassador, copies were conveyed by
an FBI representative by a special flight carried out by the U.S. Naval
Attache to the Dallas office of the FBI for possible use in the ongoing
investigation. One photograph, cropped by the FBI, tas shown to
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD (Lee Harvey OSWALD's mother) in Dallas on the
evening of 23 November 1963 by FBI Agent Bardwell D. ODUM.

4. The Warren Commission's report describes the sequence of events
at pp. 364-365 and 667 (Attachment B) which ultimately resulted in
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped
photo of Jack RUBY the day before he murdered her son. (A further
complication compounding this erroneous conclysion was the fact that.
when she had been shown a copy of the same photograph in her appearance
before the Commission, it had been cropped by the FBI in Washington in

a slightly different manner.)

vividly than this one the difficulties that beset simple truth in the

politicized, rigidly deterministic interpretive climate that has been
nurtured by the media over the past decade about the Kennedy Assassina-
tion. The phdfograph, acknowledged nov not to be RUBY, has continued to
preoccupy “specialists” and has become the centerpiece of another
hypothesis that holds OSWALD to have been "franed" by the use of a

double in his activity in Mexico City.

Lee Harvey OSWALD - Reporting on Mexico City Sta:

6. Although in no way related to Lee Harvey OSWALD or his stay in
Mexico City from the morning of 27 September 1963 totthe*morning of
2 October 1963, at least one set of photographs of the unidentified man
originated during OSWALD's stay there. It is important, therefore, to
an understanding of the acquisition and handling of the photographs by
the Mexico Station to review what the Station ascertained and did with

the information it developed about OSWALD in Mexico City, together with

Headquarters action on that information.

7. From all credible evidence known to this time (sone, incidentally,
added since the exhaustively unique work of tHe Warren Commission),
Lee Harvey OSWALD spent four (4) full days and two (2) partial days--

7 about 116 hours in all-~in Mexico City from about 10:00 a.m. 27 September

2 This is the thrust of the article "The CIA and the Man Who Nas Not

1963 to about 8:30 a.m. 2 October 1963. His place of residence was a
small commercial traveler hotel, not frequented by "gringos”--the

Hotel Conpfercito--where he was registered under alias. Exhaustive and
detailed interviews and interrogation by the Mexican authorities and
the’ FBI, after the assassination, established that in the recollection of

all hotel personnel he left early and returned late each day of his stay.

8. Assuming, and allowing for the fact of late arrival and early
departure; that he slept one-third of the time of his stay (38 or 39
hours), there remain some 78 hours of activity to be accounted for.
Overall, CIA's information can account solely for very brief periods
during 27, 28 September and 1 October. AT] coverage by CIA during the
| entire period was technical. The Station had no live source (living

| agent) coverage either unilateral or from-Mexican liaison.

9. It should be noted that OSWALD was in no sense "under investi-

i gation." None of the facts of his defection and stay in the USSR and
return to the U.S., 1959 - 1962, were known to Mexico Station files
before 10 October 1963, when the bare bones of his biography were

! - forwarded by Headquarters in response to a Station cabled report of
8 October which had forwarded, on a routine basis, what appeared to be

f a contact by an Anerican for a visa to Cuba in transit to the USSR. This
was indicated and deduced from technically acquired information on
1 October, which was the first and only occasion in which OSWALD

identified himself (partially) by true name,

10. At no time during his stay in Mexico City did the CIA acquire
a photo of OSWALD. A careful review of all coverage, voice intercept,
as well as photographic, of both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies was
conducted by the Station on 22 and 23 November 1963 after the assassina-
tion, going back to materials from August 1963. It is, therefore, firm
that there was no CIA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his
Mexico trip or stay in Mexico City. Moreover, although it had made a
cabled request on 15 October, the Mexico Station had no photo of OSWALD
in its records, nor did it receive one fron Headquarters--which did not

have one either--before 22 November 1963.

11. Eepitg Fis intensive review of voice intercept transcripts
by the monitor and other personnel on the basis of the 1 October inter~
cept--which had been reported to Headquarters and disseminated to the
interested members of the intelligence community (as an ex-Marine OSWALD
was a Navy and FBI case under the Delimitations Agreement, and potentially
of interest to the Department of State)--turned up matches based on
content with materials intercepted on 27 and 28 September 1963. These
matches were reported to Headquarters on 23 November 1963. Analysis
based on voice comparison (except for what could be recalled by the
i monitor--and this was not an insignificant element because of the

memorably poor Russian. spoke by OSWALD) could not be made because the

tapes, in accordance with the normal practice, had been erased and re-used.

12. It must be stressed that the voice intercept and photographic
coverage was not (and normally is not) processed in “real time." The
means of acqugsition and the volume of the information precludes anything
but the spot reporting of items judged by the monitor to be of more than
ordinary interest and, therefore, noted in summary logs. Full texts of
selected items require consultation of the tape and either a full tran-
scription or full translation or both. Photo coverage tends ‘to become
available in quantity lots which requires scanning and selection on a
rapid and accelerated basis in four or five day “peaks.” One of the
"triggers" that normally operates to focus and accelerate more speedy
review and reporting of this kind of raw intelligence is the mention of
aname. This was precisely what occurred in the second of two conversa-
tions on 1 October with the Soviet Embassy, during which the speaker said
he was "Lee OSWALD." It was this information reported by the Station to-

Headquarters in its first indication on OSWALD on 8 October 1963.

13, The Mexico Station did one more thing in its 8 October report
on Lee OSWALO based on its 1 October voice intercepts: it coupled the
data with descriptive information it had acquired from & sensitive
collateral source--a photograph of a male individual, apparently an
American, who was observed entering the Soviet Embassy on 1 October.
The Station reported this detail on the 8th as a matter of coincident
fact. The Station did not assert or suggest that the data deduced from

the photo was in fact OSWALD, or indeed, was in any way related to OSWALD.

Lee Harvey OSWALD - CIA Coverage of City Stay

14. One additional element of background must be stipulatéd now as
the final préMondition to understanding the relevance (or irrelevance)
of the photo of the unknown individual placed in the chain of evidence
on 23 November in Dallas by FBI Agent Bardwell ODUM: what was the
totality of CIA Mexico's coverage of OSWALD's activity as of the after-

noon of the 23rd when all available coverage had been checked?

15. “The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as follows:

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1605 hours Mexico City time.

Silvia DURAN, a Mexican national, a local employee of the Cuban
Embassy, Consular section, a receptionist, speaks with an unknown
male at the Soviet Embassy. Silvia DURAN tells the man that the
American citizen was there, the one who wants a visa for Cuba on
his way to the Soviet Union, and he wants to know with whom he was
talking there because she (Silvia DURAN) had sent him to the Soviet
Embassy saying that if they accepted him and gave Rim a visa, then
the Cubans (Embassy) would also give hima visa without further
paper work, only advising Immigration in Cuba. The American, she
says, wants to know with whon he had talked there because he says
he was told there would be no problem. The man in the Soviet

Embassy says to wait a moment. A different Soviet speaks, and

Silvia DURAN explains the same thing to him. This man says to
leave a name and telephone number and says he will call back.
Silvia DURAN gives the telephone 11-28-47 (Cuban Consulate).

She also takes advantage of the conversation and states she has
moved and wants to advise the Soviet Embassy of her change of
address so that she can receive the Soviet Embassy's Bulletin.

The man says to call KOUKHARENKO to give Her new address , then he
asks the name of the Consul or Cultural Attaché, Silvia DURAN says
the name is Teresa PROENZA and the telephone number is 14-13-26.

The man says thanks. : >

b. 27 September 1963 (Friday), 1626 hours Mexico City time.

An unidentified male, a Soviet, calls the Cuban Consulate, asks
Silvia DURAN if the American had been there. Silvia DURAN says he
is there now. The Soviet says the Anerican showed papers from the
Consulate in Washington, that he wants to go to the Soviet Union
and be there for-a long time with his wife, who is Russian, but
the answer has not come from Washington in respect to this problem,
and according to this procedure it takes four or five months, but
without having permission fron the Soviet Union they should ask, or
better said, they cannot issue a visa there without asking Washing-
ton. However, according to this man, he showed a letter indicating
he was a member of an organization in favor of Cuba,and that the

Cubans said that they cannot issue a visa without his having a visa

for the Soviet Union, and now he (the Soviet) does not know what to
do with him (the American), because they have to waft for an answer
from Wastington.

Silvia DURAN agrees the same problen exists with the Cubans,

that the problem with him (the American) is that he does not know
anyone in Cuba and therefore if that is true it will be difficult
for him to get a visa for Cuba, because he was thinking of proces -
sing his visa (for the Soviet Union), because he knew it would

in Cuba, and from there go to the Soviet Union. The Soviet said
the thing is that if his wife right now were in Mashington she
would receive her visa right now, or permission, from the Soviet
Union, to return to her country, she is going to receive her visa in
Washington but having this visa, she could communicate to any place
this permission, for example here or any place she could receive it
(visa or permission), but right now they do not have them.

Silvia DURAN says certainly and they cannot give a letter either
because they do not know if the visa will be approyed. The Soviet
says he cannot give a letter or recommendation either because he
does not know him (the American) and asks to be excused for

bothering her. Silvia DURAN says that is all right and many thanks.

asks the American in English what does he want?; The American says

American says I was just now at your Embassy and they took my

The ‘same person who phoned a day or so ago and spoke in broken
Russian speaks to OBYEDKOV (a Soviet Embassy guard). He says:
This is Lee OSWALD speaking. I was at your place last Saturday and
spoké to a consul, and they said that they would send a telegram to

I don't remember the name of that consul. OBYEDKOV says: ‘KOSTIKOV.

17. Summing up, we can state, or by free interpretation reasonably
infer from the intercept evidence, that OSWALD made or could have made
the Fol lowing "contacts with the Cuban and Soviet official establishments

in Mexico City.
‘

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday). After arrival and check-in to
his hotel, OSWALD went first to the Cuban Embassy where he talked
with Mrs. Silvia DURAN. The time of his first Cuban Embassy visit
is unknown. The time of his second Cuban Embassy visit was about
1600 hours (i.e., just before closing). Sometime between the two
Cuban Embassy visits, at Mrs. DURAN's indication, hé must have
visited the Soviet Embassy. We have no indi catio® vhothe talked

intercepts a - e above, but others for the 27th and one for 3 October
that seemed to have relevance. These have not been included in this
summary because they appear, on review, to be excludable fron the OSWALD
matter on logical or substantive grounds, or both, bearing in mind that
the Soviet Embassy received many calls pertaining to visa matters.

. On the 27th at 1037 hours the Soviet Embassy received a call fron
an unknown individual speaking Spanish who said he wanted visas to go to
Odessa.’ He was told the Consul was not in and to call back at 1130.
OSWALD is: known to have arrived at the Flecha Roja bus terminal on bus
#516 at circa 1000 hours on the 27th. It was, therefore, possible for
him to have made this call. But granting this, it is unreasonable to
believe the calls were OSWALD's for the following reasons:

a. The caller wanted visas, and specifically for Odessa.
OSWALD was seeking a visa and never in any context did he specify
the Black Sea port of Odessa as a destination.

There was no photographic coverage of OSWALD's entries
into either the Cuban. or Soviet Embassies on the 27th. The lack of
coveragewon the Cuban installation is explainable: the camera,
based on the recollection of officers still in service in Head-
quarters, was down on the 27th because of mechanical malfunction,
which was in course of correction. Why OSWALD was missed in his
probable entry to the Soviet installation:on the 27th is not yet

explained; but no technical operation of that kind is infallible.

b. 28 September 1963 (Saturday). [Note: Both the Cuban and

Soviet Embassies were closed to the public on Saturdays. Photo-

graphic coverage was normally suspended Saturdays and Sundays.]

b. The call was directed to the correct Soviet consular
number: 15-60-55. On 1 October, OSWALD first called the wrong
number, 15-69-87 (the MA's number), and had to redirect his call to
the correct number, 15-60-55. It seems unlikely he would have made
what would have been his initial call, on Friday the 27th, to the
correct number, and called the incorrect number on 1 October.

c. There is every reason to believe from the context of the
intercepts, para 15, a-e above, that OSWALD's first destination
after arrival and check-in to his hotel, was a visit to the Cuban
Embassy.

d. The use of the Spanish language would exclude OSWALD unless
he made use of an intermediary, which seems unlikely from what is

known of his modus operandi.

On 3 October at 1539 hours an individual speaking broken Spanish,
then English, called the Soviet Embassy and asked for a visa. The Soviet
respondent says: Call on the other phone. ‘The requestor says: I'm

OSHALD, notwithstanding the holiday schedule, went on Saturday

a Consu?” He apparently could not recall his new Texas address.
At circa 1151 hours he went to the Cuban Enbassy--his third entry-~
where he had registered it in his visa application the day
previously. He secured the address from Mrs. DURAN and she called
the Soviet Consulate presumably to permit him to give them the
address over the phone. Instead, the Soviet with whom OSWALD spoke
over Hrs. DURAN's telephone invited OSWALD to come back in person,
and he safd he would inmediately. Presumably, thereupon OSWALD went

looking for a visa to go to Russia. The Soviet says: Please call on the
telephone of the Consul, 15-60-55.° The requestor says: One moment
please, I'1] have to get a pencil to write the number down. They issue
the visa there? The Soviet: That depends on your conversation. I don't
know about this business. The requestor asks for the number again. The
Soviet gives him the number and tells him to ask for the Consul of the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico. “

The relevance of this intercept to OSWALD is excludable on three
grounds:

a. The use of broken Spanish. OSWALD throughout used broken
Russian or English. He had no competance in Spanish to handle a
conversation of this kind.

b. The substance of the request indicates a visa request in
the first stages of initiation. OSWALD had developed his matter

with the Cubans and the Soviets the previous Saturday to a point
well beyond the stage indicated by the substance of this call.

c. 29 September 1963 (Sunday). No activity registered.

j 30 September 1963 (Monday). No activity registered.

(It is known that OSWALD reserved space this date on a Mexico City-

Loredo bus, departing 2 October 1963 at 0830 hours.)

e. 1 October 1963 (Tuesday). OSWALD made at least two calls,

at. 1031 and 1045 hours, to the Soviet Embassy. He identified himself
twice during the second call when he talked with OBYEDKOV--a guard-~
and referred to his talk on Saturday, probably with KOSTIKOV.: ‘There
was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on 1 October; if the follou-
ing reasoning is correct, that was as it should os From the context
an of the two calls, there would have been no reason for him to go to
the Embassy. His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of
the USSR Embassy in Washington. His two calls on 1 October were
concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.
Under those circumstances, it is unreasonable to believe OSWALD

would have gone to the Soviet Embassy on that date.

18. The camera at about mid-day registered the entry into the

Soviet Embassy of a white-shirted individual who, in the opinion of the

c. OSWALD had left Mexico City, based on all the credible
evidence, the early morning of the previous day, 2 October, and
could not have made this local call.

only person--a non-Latin, and possibly an Anerican--who entered the Soviet

identification data derived from the voice intercept and the descriptive
dat derived fron the photograph, the Station réported the two elements

as separate facts in its cable to Headquarters on, 8 October.

19. The Station's action was not unusual:and really amouhited to an

whether the Embassy had received any news con=
cerning a telegram which had been sent to
Washington. The Anerican was described as
approximately 35 years old, with an athletic
build, about 6 feet tall, with a "receding"

hairline.

(2) It is believed that OSWALD may be identical
*to Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD, born on 18 October 1939
in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine
who defected to the Soviet Union in Octobér 1959

22. Although the reaction of the Headquarters desk was “by the
book" and in good time, there were a number of errors in this advisory
to the departments which, on the record, were concerned with the OSWALD

case:

a. OSHALD's middle name was misgiven: “Henry” for Harvey.
The reason for this mistake is sinplicity itself. The sheet opening
the File on OSHALD on 9 December 1960 had been erroneously inscribed
“CSHALD,"Lee Henry." That sheet--unchanged except for the notation of

the error--is still the first sheet in the OSWALD file.

b. His wife's maiden name was misspelled: “PUSAKOVA" for PRUSAKOVA..

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

Headquarters canmunications throughout the month). More important was:

¢. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with
@ concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual
observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to
Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive fact. The Station's qualification,
“appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The Anerican."

There can be no question that this misreading of the Mexico Station report
was an analyst's error which escaped detection in the coordination before
release: the descriptive details attributed to OSWALD were so far off the
mark as to be immediately recognizable as such by the recipients in Head~
quarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had photos of OSWALD. (In partial
explanation, if not exculpation, be it recalled that as of that moment CIA

had no photograph of OSWALD in Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

23. Confirmation of this judgment is provided by the contents of
the cable composed by the same analyst and sent as of 22092 time (two

hours later) to Mexico Station, referencing its 8 October cable:

description should have been sufficient, in view of the incongruities
with the details deduced from the photo of the unidentified male, to
keep these two matters apart as investigative facts: But things did not

25. Mexico Station on 15 October 1963 asked Headquarters to

“please pouch a photo of OSWALD." Headquarters electrically delivered

to the Department of the Navy the following message on 24 October 1963.
“Lee Henry [sic] OSWALD. . .

26. Within its limitations and capabilities, Mexico Station had

all it gould to comply with Headquarters instructions:

a. Headquarters had been alerted, and in turn those agencies
with an investigative or policy interest in OSWALD as an Anerican
in the United States had been alerted, both in Washington and in

the field. .

b. Mexico Station had no further contacts by OSWALD to report
because--as it was ultimately ascertained--he had left Mexico City

on 2 October. 10°

c. OSWALD was not an Agency investigative responsibility, in
any case. Even with a photograph, it would have taken very special
efforts, triggered by the other interested U.S. agencies, to have
made a positive identification in view of OSHALD's hotel registra-

tion under alias.

There the matter rested until mid-day 22 November 1963.

28, “it is clear that Mexico Station had forgotten that according
to its own communication the unidentified male in the photo was of

“apparent age 35" and that the accurate description of OSWALD forwarded

1 October who could be identical."

29. The Station meanwhile had begun an exhaustive and accelerated
review of all its technical and photographic intelligence. A dispatch
was prepared in accordance with the indication given in th cable of
22 November, cited in paragraph. 25 above. The dispatch noted that

Attached were eight photographs: four (of which two were marked

(unmarked on reverse) showing the individual in a black shirt. It
would seem to be logical that the word "sets" was probably onitted from

paragraph two of the dispatch between the words "two" and "photographs."

30. That the Station was working under forced draft is clearly

apparent from the text of the dispatch, which tacked on“a material fact

as a postscript. That fact was reported simultaneously by cable to

Headquarters at 0053Z time, 23 November:

telephone with the Western Hemisphere Chief of Division, Mr. J. C. KING,
and secured permission to give copies of the photographs of the uniden-

33. What happened next is best reflected in a personal note by the
Chief of Station to the WH Division Chief, mailed to the latter from
Dallas, together with copies of the photographs, by the“tegal Attaches

“Mexico Station is reviewing all available photos

reported the results of its effort to review al] available coverage:

"Complete recheck of photos of all visitors to

39. With this communication the matter of the “unidentified

conviction, at first latent, then expressed, that the photographed
individual might be identical with OSWALD. This applies especially to
the Station, though at a certain point even Headquarters moved no

non-performance. It was a critical failure, for example, that no photo

41. Special Agent of the FBI, Bardwell D. ODUM, on 23 November

Enbassy in Mexico City on 4 Octéber 1963, two days after OSMALD had

43. at this point, for the record, the total available photo

coverage of the unidentified individual numbers twelve (12) photographs:

a. Five (5) taken on 1 October 1963, entering and exiting the
Soviet Embassy. He is garbed in a white shirt and light-colored

(khaki-2) trousers.

b. Five (5) taken on 4 October 1963 in front of the Soviet
Embassy. He is garbed in a dark, open, button-down, shirt with a

high-neckline undershirt showing and dark trousers.

c. Two (2) taken on 15 October 1963 in front of the Cuban

Embassy. He is wearing a dark, collarless T-shirt or light sweater.

The negatives of all of these are extent and are now held in Headquarters

as integral parts of the OSWALD and related file holdings.

44. The result of ODUM's display of the Photograph--to repeat, a
+ cropped version of one of those noted under paragraph 43b, above--was
Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a picture of
her son's killer, Jack RUBY, a day before he perpetrated the deed! Again
the Warren Commission Report (pp. 364-365, 367) exhaustively disposes
of this erroneous charge and requires no repetition here. A complica-

ting fact developed along the way was Mrs. OSWALD's (correct) observation,

when she finally admitted before the Commission that the ODUM photograph
was not RUBY, was that the photo had been cropped differently from the
one she had Béen shown in Dallas. Inspector HALLEY's cropped version of
the ODUM photograph became Conmission Exhibit 237 (see Hearings,

Vol! XVI, p. 638). :

45. The net effect of the developments in the hearings of the
Commission was. to require the admission of the ‘cropped photograph into
evidence in a chain of depositions beginning with ODUM, including the
FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed the photograph used by
the Commission in Washington), and Richard HELMS, who deposed for. the
originator. These documents speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearings, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other senior Agency officers strongly
advised against the publication of the photograph in any form on the
grounds that the Soviets would be immediately alerted to the existence
of a useful and continuing U.S. intelligence operation, and the opera-
tion would go down the drain. There were repeated cablgs exchanged on

* this point between Headquarters and Mexico Station during the summer
of 1964, in particular fron 23 September to 15 October 1964 when the

Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

47. In acceding to the Commission's request for a deposition,

Mr. HELMS, then the Deputy Director for Plans, replied affirmatively to

confidential and productive operation. In
addition, it could be embarrassing to the indivi-
sdual “involved who as far as the Agency is aware
had no connection with Lee Harvey OSWALD or the

assassination of President KENNEDY." $8

‘ 48. In this instance the needs of the Commission prevailed over
the DCI's statutory obligation to protect sources and methods. The
"Unidentified Individual" remains to this day unidentified and there is
no credible evidence up to this time to rebut the assertion made by
Mr. HELMS in the concluding sentence of his memorandum to Mr. RANKIN on
23 June 1964. And the operation did, as predicted, go down the drain.
Within a week of the public appearance of the Odum Exhibit No. 1 and

! + Commission Exhibit 237, members of the Soviet -Embassy began systematic
efforts to survey the surrounding buildings, ostensibly for rental
space, but clearly their inquiries were directed to spotting possible
camera sites. The operation was continued in any case. Within a year
it had become almost totally unproductive in coverage on Americans in
contact with the Embassy--a clear sign that. this category of visitor

-i was being warned away bythe Soviets themselves.

Phase III: The “Unidentified Man" Photographs, 1964 - 1975

49. As,Gould be foreseen, there has been persistent pressure by
critics of the Warren Commission Report to exploit Odum Exhibit No. 1
ands Commission Exhibit No. 237 for partisan interpretive purposes. A
considerable correspondence has accumulated since the end of 1964 in
which the Agency has attempted to be responsive to these requests and,
simultaneously, has tried to satisfy what has been its sole interest
fron the inception of the matter: to protect the method of acquisition
of the photograph and the foreign liaison relationship which made the

rr)

acquisition possible.

50. Following are highlights from the correspondence during the

current phase.

a. On 16 May 1967, over the signature of the General Counsel
of the Agency, Lawrence R. HOUSTON, CIA voluntarily submitted a
statement about the photograph to Judge BAGERT of the Criminal
District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louisiana.
The response dealt affirmatively with the contents of the subpoena
that had been delivered to the United States Marshall in. the District
of Columbia, despite the fact that the subpoena could not be
executed because of the lack of jurisdiction.

Mr. HOUSTON proferred on Agency behalf categoric assur-

ances to the court regarding the inaccuracy of statements and

‘inferences made by Mr. GARRISON in New Orleans about the photograph
of the unidentified individual. The following is extracted from

Mr. HOUSTON's memorandum.

+ "Because of the publicity which has surrounded the
Orleans Parish Grand Jury proceedings, we have
recently carried out an exhaustive search of the
files of the Central Intelligence Agency for any
“picture of Lee Harvey OSWALD taken in Mexico. As
a result of this search, I can state categorically
that the files of this Agency do not contain, “and
never have contained, any such picture of
Lee Harvey OSWALD taken in Mexico and that we have

no information whatsoever that any such photograph

ever existed. To the best of our knowledge and
information, therefore, there is no such photograph.
Furthermore, the photograph which is printed in the
Warren Commission Report, Exhibit No. 237 in Volume
XVI, never contained more than one figure, and the
figure in the photograph depicts an individual who,
to our knowledge, has not been identified. The
circumstances of the filing of this photograph with
the Warren Commission are set forth in affidavits

of any photograph that answers in any way the
desgription of the one we understand was requested

in the subpoena.

"I hope you will accept this information in this
form in the spirit of cooperation in which it is

proferred.”

b.. The Agency has repeatedly serviced requests about the
identify of the unknown individual from Mr, Emory L. BROWN, Jr.,
Route #4, Box 82, Squankum Road, Farmingdale, New Jérsey. The last
ra exchange of correspondence in our record covered the period

j 4 - 17 April 1970.

c. Detailed inquiries on the unidentified individual were
received on 1 and 24 November 1971, to which the Agency responded
on 15 November and 14 December, respectively, from

Mr. Paul L. HOCH, 1735 Highland Place #2, Berkeley, California.

FBI's declassification of Commission Document No. 556. On 8 April
1971, Mr. FENSTERWALD was invited to the Agency for a discussion
with théGeneral Counsel, Mr. HOUSTON, of his question about the
photograph of the unknown individual. Two other photographs of
the unidentified individual, in addition to the photograph
depicted in the two Commission exhibits, were shown to him at that
time. It is a matter of more than ordinary interest to note that
on this occasion Mr. FENSTERWALD, who was accompanied by his
partner, Mr. William OHLHAUSEN, told Mr. HOUSTON and another
representative of the Agency in attendance that_he Knew who ‘the
unidentified man was. The following is extracted from Mr. HOUSTON's

tte Memorandum of Record, 8 April 1971:

"3. Mr. FENSTERWALD came to my office this
morning with his partner, William G. OHLHAUSEN,
looked at the other photographs, and told us he

serving a prison term somewhere in the United

. States and admitted that he had known OSNALD, but
Mr. FENSTERWALD said there was nothing to indicate
any connection between the man in the photographs

and the assassination of President KENNEDY.

this time, as he said enough people had suffered

say he was sure we had a file on the man. He
asked if he could have the photographs, and I
asked how he could use them. He said he did
not know and finally agreed that for the time
being he would not press his request. . . .

The whole meeting was extremely friendly and

they thanked us for our response."

The following is extracted from the Memorandum of Record

i o9
by the other CIA man present, Mr. Arthur E. DOOLEY.

‘ “Mr. FENSTERWALD said he knew who the person
i was and had spoken to him; that the man was too
! nervous to come forth on his own. FENSTERWALD
would not give the man's name but said he is an
American, serving a prison term in this country
on a criminal charge, and that he had met OSWALD
in Mexico. I asked whether the prisoner had any
. conspiratorial relationship with OSWALD.

: FENSTERWALD replied he did not know the answer
as he had not interviewed the man as yet. We
reiterated that we did not know who the man

Mr. FENSTERWALD made no reference in his subsequent

of the "Unidentified Individual," though the claim, if true, would
be of direct evidential interest and possibly permit us to assert
with finality what we believe has been the fact from the beginning:

the "Unidentified Man" has nothing to do with the OSWALD case at all.
