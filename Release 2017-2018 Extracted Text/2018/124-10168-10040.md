Dear Mr. Hoover: ae (41-5) ‘aaleg - on

We have completed our review of domestic positive intelligence
collection dered by your letter of 11 Maxch 1970. We warmly
welcome periodic reexamination by our two agencies of the implemen.

which you proposed, ! concur also with your comments that there is
a need for close coordi of our efforts in the field of positive and
counterintelligence coliection. To be most effective, l agree that it
is essential for s Agency, together with your Bureau, to conduct a
aly of clandestine collection activity, The product is
nportance to the national security and to the United States
ntelligence Community, Therefore we endorse your proposal for a
reexamination and bespeak your desires as to how this might be
conducted.

H With regard to the 1966 set of ground rules, which you sent to ih
i the then Director, Vice Admiral William F, Raborn, Jr., the compe~
y tent work of our respective representatives did, in fact, produce an

°
() effective and realistic agreement. Iwelcorne your statement that no
major problems have been encountered since its adoption.

I feel strongly that there are other related subjects, of similar
importance to the national security, which warrant periodic reexamina-
‘tion since they have a direct bearing on domestic clandestine collection

of positive intelligence. REC 8 = * ois

_ that the following subjects are desexving of your personal consideration:

‘As a result of our review, engendered by your letter, I believe

‘Audio coverige provides timely ©
intelligence of inestimabie. worth to U.S. officials. for
policy planning, early warning, and accurate guidance’
necessary for the improvement-of operational and collec-
tion activity here and abroad. Audio coverage is unique

| production because it-is.readily subject to local cross-.

checking and evaluation which is far more difficult and
costly to achieve abroad, Further, such coverage is on
targets which affect directly the national interests.

For several years your Bureau had been recep-

which cannot be duplicated by any other U.S. agency.

On 2 October 1969 two-related requests for audio «
coverage were submitted by this Agency pertaining to
positive intelligence targets, one of whom had KGB connec-
tions. (I refer to the case of @RUEEMERRMEand GRRREEE
(RRESESAQ.) Your Bureau replied that henceforth the
Agency should refer all such cases directly to the Attorney
General for approval. G

It is suggested that the question of audio coverage
beireopened between representatives of your Bureau and
this Agency. I would welcome your thoughts and observa-~
tions on this subject.

I wish to assure you that I believe that this sensitive
type of collection should be implemented under rigid and
stringent controls, This is absolutcly necessary in order to
maintain the highest standard of security both in instituting
the coverage and for the exploitation of the product. (An
excellent example of this is demonstrated in your effective
and secure production of SCOPE. ) JS) z

(4) Courses in Positive Intelligence Requirements and
Reporting, Since the collection and reporting of positive
foreign intelligence is, as you say, only incidental to your
‘main internal security and counterintelligence responsibili-
ties, I realize that your personnel are somewhat at a dis-
advantage in carrying out the evaluating and reporting
processes necessary for the conduct of positive intelligence.

[growing sophistication and increased capabilities of hostile
intelligence services, it is suggested that CIA and FBI
experts in this field meet as required at our respective
Headquarters, the Washington and New York Field Offices,
in order to keep abreast of new developments, modus
operandi, operational tasks, and diverse missions of
opposition services. I know that you will agree with me
that‘no opportunities for improvement should be over-

services who are charged with undermining the security
of the United States. These sessions should also provide
an opportunity to explore and devise new means to pene-
trate and neutralize these inimical forces.

(6) Live Bloc Sources. The record of our coopera~
tion and coordination to exploit live penetrations and defec-
tors from Bloc sources proves the success of our mutual
effort, : :

' I believe that there is room for substantial improve-
ment in achieving a more uniform and efficient exploitation
of the positive intelligence potential of certain of these
Sensitive sources. I would invite your thoughts on how we
may better coordinate requirements for these sources and
establish a more thorough evaluation of their positive
intelligence production before it is given general dissemina-
tion within the Government. Our review would suggest that
there are good reasons for consultation to explore ‘the
development of higher quality live sources, for example

feel confident that both agencies have adequately exploited

the full potential of this field, and would urge that this
subject be explored by our respective representatives

(8) New Left and Racial Matters. There is already
a substantial exchange of information in this field. Limi-
tations of manpower raise a serious question as to whether
both agencies can keep pace with future unpredictable
developments, The increasingly close connection between
these forces in the United States and hostile elements
abroad has been well established by both of our agencies.

I feel it would be in our mutual interest to determine how
we can lest enmplov more wisely our linited nm,
knowing that this problem, which embraces bombings,
hijacking, assassination, and the demeaning of law enforce-
ment officers, is international in scope.

(9) Relations with Domestic Field Offices and Legal
Attaches. Ido not feel that there are any serious conflicts -
in this area but there may be room for improving the quality
of liaison in order to expand positive intelligence collection.

» |Given the changing situations both here and abroad, periodic
re-examination of field relations could assist both agencies
to make mutually-agreed adjustments,

Mr, Hoover, I wish to assure you that I value highly your personal
judgment in affairs bearing on the national security. I know that your
experience is derived from a unique lifetime of dedicated service to our
country. In this spirit,’ 1 welcome sincerely your observations on the

In June, 1957, our Phoonix Office presented a
problem concerning the Bureau's handling of informants -
on the Hesican border. These informants were operating
inside Mexico. The problem was predicated on situaticns
which might arise as the result of CIA's endeavors to
develop informants who already were being handled by the
Bureau, It was pointed out that CIA logically could
come in contact with such sources and could make approaches
for recruitment, It was recommended and approved that
in order to protect our coverage in the border area, a
valuable, trusted, and reliable confidential source would
continue to be utilized even if he were contaced by CIA.
Our policy was that we would not identify our sources to
