Re: Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-16
(Oswald Pre-Assassination Files)

Dear John:

Under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44
U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994), the Review Board has the authority.to “direct.a -
Government office to . . . investigate the facts surrounding, additional information [and]
records... .” Section 7()(1)(C)(ii). Pursuant to this authority, the Review Board is
seeking to resolve in a complete and comprehensive manner certain questions related to
files on Lee Harvey Oswald that CLA may have held prior to the assassination of
President Kennedy. Accordingly, we request that CIA provide complete and
comprehensive answers to the questions identified below.

On May 12, 1992, Director Robert M. Gates testified to the Senate Committee on
Governmental Affairs regarding CIA‘s records on Oswald prior to the assassination.
Mr. Gates testified that “[p]rior to President Kennedy’s assassination, CIA held only a
small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 34 documents amounting to 124
pages..... ”” (The Assassination Materials Disclosure Act of 1972: Hearing Before the
Committee on Governmental Affairs, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 52 (1992) (emphasis added)
(copy enclosed). It is the Review Board’s current understanding, however, that at the
time of the assassination, CIA held at least three separate files (including soft files) on
Lee Harvey Oswald: a 201 file (201-289248), an HTLINGUAL file, and an Office of

Security file.’ We have identified references to one or more other possible Oswald files
including possible soft files designated as follows: CI/SI, CI/SIG, CI/LSN, and
CS/LSN.

1. Please identify, as specifically as possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald
at the time of the assassination of President Kennedy.

2. Other than for the 201-289248 file on Oswald, please explain when each
Oswald file was opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and the
documents that were in the file at the time of the assassination.

3. For the 201-289248 file on Oswald, please identify which records (and the
total number that) were in the file at the time of the assassination.

4, To the extent that Counterintelligence and the Office of Security
maintained pre-assassination files on Oswald, please explain why those
offices maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination. In
answering this question, please make appropriate references to the
Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB) and to any other materials
(including organizational charts) that would help explain the -
jurisdictional and organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.

For each question, please explain the basis for the answer and the sources (records or
persons) whom you consulted to answer the question. To the extent that you are not
able to answer a question completely, please so indicate and provide the best reasonable
answer. If, during the course of your research, you learn that any record relating to a
pre-assassination file or record has been destroyed, please provide us with all available
information related to the destruction of the records or files. .

These queries should be interpreted in their broadest reasonable sense. To the extent
that you question whether certain responses may be within the scope of our request,
please let us know and we can advise you whether we would wish to include it. We
anticipate that the responses to these questions will be referenced in CLA‘s Final
Compliance Statement.

‘One Office of Security file on Oswald (or relating to Oswald) may have been
numbered 351-164. In addition, Margaret Stevens may have held an Office of Security
“MS-" file on Oswald.

denied, you say postponed. I am curious as to how long the post-
ponement will be. Will it be until the national security or privacy
are no longer threatened? Do we want'to require a mandatory
review every two years?

Going along, some of the language is fairly broad. We had the
exchange here a few moments ago about an intelligence agent.
Then there is another section that gives us an exception—“an in-
telligence method which is currently utilized, or reasonably expect-
ed to be utilized.” .

.The one that troubles me most, although I know there is a
reason for it, but I just am concerned about the doors it may open,
is “. .. an invasion of privacy of a livi person, whether that
person is identified in the material or not.” I am concerned about
that being used ‘as a ground for requesting postponement of disclo-

Unfortunately, and for reasons that'I do not know, what we are
dealing with is a mass of material that is not indexed, is uncatalo-
ighly disorgani: all of which makes the review

process more difficult. The material contains everything from the
most sensitive intelligence sources to the most mundane news clip-

Pp

"These records include documents that CIA had in’ its files before
the assassination, a large number of records that CIA received
later as routine disseminations from other agencies, as well as the
reports, correspondence, and other papers that CIA prepared in the
course of the assassination investigations. I should emphasize that

these records were assembled into the present collection as a result

of specific inquiries received from the Warren Commission or the -

House Select Committee on Assassinations.

Prior to President Kennedy’s assassination, CIA held only a
small file on Lee Harvey Oswald that consisted of 84 documents
amounting to 124 pages, some of which originated with the FBI,
the State Department, the Navy, and newspaper clippings. Only 11
of these documents originated -within CIA. I have brought along a
copy of Oswald’s file as it existed before ihe assassination so that
you can see firsthand how slender it was at the time. As I have
already noted, we have declassified the CIA documents in this file
with quite minimal deletions and we are providing them to the Na-
tional Archives. : : :

The records in this file dealt with Oswald’s defection to the
Soviet Union in 1959 and his activities after his return in 1962. By
contrast, it was only after the assassination that CIA accumulated
the rest of the material on Oswald, some 38,000 pages, most of
which CIA received from other agencies after November 22, 1963.

The Committee*has asked about documents in our possession
generated by other agencies. In fact, much of the material held by

TA originated with other agencies or- departments. For example,
in the 17 boxes of Oswald records, approximately 40 percent of the
documents originated with the FBI and about 20 percent originated:
from the State Department or elsewhere.

Our staff is still going through the-material compiled at the re-
quest of the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee
on Assassinations, which includes 68 boxes of poper ‘records and
one box that contains 73 reels of microfilm. microfilms, in
part, overlap material in other parts of the collection. ‘We estimate
that within the 63 boxes of paper records, approximately 27 per-
cent originated with a variety of other U.S::Government agencies,
private organizations, arid foreign and American press. :

Although our documents do include many documents from othe:
agencies, we nonetheless have a substantial collection of CIA docu-
ments that will require considerable effort to review, and as I said
earlier, at my direction, this review for declassification is ‘now un-

derway. a :
A preliminary survey of these files has provided us some indica-
tions of what they contain, Although the records cover a wide vari-
ety of topics, they principally focus on CIA activities concerning
Cuba and Castro, Oswald's defection to the Soviet Union, and Os-
wald’s subsequent activities-in Mexico City and New Orleans. They
also include a large number of name traces requested by the s

believe these actions attest to the seriousness of our intent to
getty these papers declassified and released, and to open what re-
mains classified to outside non-governmental review. It is against
this background that in response to the Committee's request, I cite
our few technical reservations about the mechanism established by
the joint resolution to achieve this same regult. I intend to address
only intelligence community concerns. I will defer to the Depart-
ment of Justice on any additional problems posed by the joint reso-
lution. - . . : .

First, vesting in an outside body-the determination as to whether
CIA materials related to the assassination can be released to the
public is inconsistent with my own statutory responsibility for the
protection of intelligence sources and methods. .

Second, I am concerned that the joint resolution contains no pro-
vision requiring security clearances or secure document han
by the assassination materials review board or its staff. .

Third, I am concerned that the joint resolution does not provide
the Agency with the opportunity to object to. the release.of CIA in-
formation contained in documents o ted by Congress or the
Warren Commission. Under the joint resolution, documents origi-
nated by these entities can be released directly by the executive di-
rector of the assassination materials review board without any
review by the President or other Executive Branch agencies.

Fourth, the joint resolution provision for a 80-day period for
agencies or departments to appeal decisions by the executive direc-
tor to release information may not provide sufficient time for
meaningful review of what could prove to be a large volume of ma-
terial at one time. . .

Fifth, and finally, Section 6 of the joint-resolution, which. out-
lines the grounds for postponement of public release of a document,
makes no provision for postponing release. of documents that may
contain Executive privilege or deliberative process, attorney-client,
or attorney work product information. le such privileges could
be waived in the public interest and, in fact, are not likely to arise
with respect to factual information directly related to the JFK as-
sassination, they would be unavailable under the joint resolution in

rare case they might be n . .

eres are the technical problems that I believe can be solved and
that will, in fact, expedite the release of documents bearing on the
assassination of President Kennedy. But, again, whatever the
future course of this legislation, CIA is proceeding even now to
review for declassification the relevant documents under its cone
trol. Further, we will cooperate fully with ‘any mechanism estab-
Ushed by the Congress and the President to declassify all o:
Mr. Chairman, let me close with a comment on why I am person-
ally committed to getting these documents out. Like all Americans
old. enough to remember that terrible day in 1963, and as several
members of the Committee have alluded to, I also remember where
I was and what I was doing.

55

I was a college student at William and Mary, and I can remem-
ber how the word spread-like wild fire between classes of that hor-
rible event. I made my way to Washington that weekend and stood
at the intersection of Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues,
where I waited for hours to watch the President's funeral cortege. I
will never forget it. é

I entered public service less than three years later, heeding

i nt Kennedy's inaugural call, a call I think many in my gen:
eration heard. He said then, “Now, the trumpet summons us again,
not as a call to bear. arms, though arms we need, not as a call to
battle, though in battle we are, but as a call to bear the burden of
a long. ht. struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, pa-
tient in tribulation, a struggle against jibe common enemies of
man——tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.”

‘Mr. Chairman, the only thing more horrifying to me than the as-
sassination itself is the insidious, perverse notion that elements of
the American Government, that my own ency, had some part in
it. T am determined personally to make public or to expose to disin-
terested eyes every relevant scrap of paper in CIA’s ession, in
the hope of helping to dispel this corrosive suspicion. With or with-
out legislation, I intend to proceed. I believe I owe that to his
memory,

you.

public access to CIA documents of historical importance. Two months ago, I an-

former Soviet Union that are 10 years old or older. In addition to the systematic

While.I expect a | amount of the material can be declassified under our pro-

Agency employees. These files contain fitness reporte, (performance evaluations),
medical evaluations and credit checks on individual CIA officers, Although irrele-
vant to the question of who killed President Kennedy, these and other personal] doc-
uments ultimately ended up in the sequestered collection of documents. I do not be-
lieve that the benefit to the Public of disclosure of this information outweighs the
clear privacy interest of the individuals in keeping the information confidential.
Similar privacy concerns exist with documents containing derogatory information
on particular individuals where the information is based on Gossip and rumor. Our
files also contain the names of individuals who provided us intelligence information
on & promise of confidentiality. We would not disclose their names in breach of such
a promise, Where we cannot disclose such information to the public, the Agency will

If legislation is hot passed by the Congress and signed by the President re; arding
the J] pers, to enhance public confidence and provide reassurance that CIA has
not held back any information relevant to the assassination, 1 will appoint a panel
of distinguished Americans from outside of Government to examine w tever docu.
ments we have redacted or kept classified. They would then issue an unclassified
public report on their. fin .

The effort required to declassify the documents related to the assassination of
President Kennedy will be daunting. However, it is an important program and I am
Personally committed to making it work. Even in a time of dim ing resources
within the Intelligence Community, I have allocation of 15 full-time positions to
expand the History Staff and to form the Historical Review Group that will review
the JFK documents and other documents of historical interest.

I believe these actions attest to the seriousness of our intent to get these Papers
declassified ‘and released, and to open what remains classified to outside, non-gov-
ernmental review, It'is against this und that, in response to this Commit-
tee’s request, I cite our technical reservations about the mechanism established by

oe ne Bescone Thank you, Mr, Chairman. I am pleased to appear
before you to testify about FBI investigative records relating to the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. I applaud this process
and your efforts. It is fundamental that Government exist to meet
the needs of its citizens, An examination of these issues is directly
related to satisfying the intense interest and concern of our citizens
about the circumstances surrounding that tragic event some 29
venom th i I favor
t, I would like to state emphatically that I fa’

maxenusn “sieclosure, consistent with the law and the legitimate
need to protect certain small but highly sensitive categories of in-
formation. I can assure you that the FBI will work cooperatively
through the Department of Justice with both the Senate and the
House to develop a comprehensive approach to these importan

issues. ; :
" As ‘you know, the Government has conducted a number of re-
views of the assassination. The Warren Commission, the House As
sassinations Committee, and the Church Committee all conduct 4
reviews that I believe can be best categorized as exhaustive. 3 is
my understanding that the FBI provided massive amounts of inf or:
mation to those entities to help ensure that they accompl
their missions. Once again, we desire to be as helpful as we are
able.

Immediately following the shooting of President Kennedy, the
FBI media e caaseive investigation. An intense effort was made. Re
lated investigations were conducted and much information was ex-
changed, as Director Gates has noted, between the various agen-
cies. As is the case with. all major investigations, thousands of

of documents were created to record the results of these ef-
orts and to facilitate the investigations. .

Many different kinds of information were recorded in the FBI
files. The results of thousands of interviews of witnesses, other ine
dividuals with possible helpful knowledge, and contacts with confi-
dential informants were.memorialized. Communications between
the FBI headquarters and our field offices, and vice versa, were in-
cluded, as were communications between the FBI and other agen
cies. Forensic reports were recorded. In all, FBI files relating to the

59

assassination contained over 499,000 pages of documents, with a
few more pages added every time the FBI follows up on a new alle-
gation or a new issue arises.

r Congress amended the Freedom of Information Act in 1974,
the FBI began receiving requests for information relating to the as-
sassination. By 1978, four years later, over 200,000 pages of materi-
al processed and made available to the public through the
FBI's public reading room. Many authors, journalists, historians,
and others have visited and revisited these materials, which
remain. available today as a valuable source of historic information.

I would like to briefly describe to the Committee a breakdown of
FBI records relating in’ some way to the assassination. The FBI has
four core files that relate directly to the investigation of the assas-
sination. Our cooperation with the Warren Commission and the in-
vestigation of Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby—those are the
four core files. There are a proximately 499,000 pages in these
files, 263,000 of which are duplicate pages that were cross-filed,

agency records, and some FBI records that have not been
P. pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.

Approximately 228,000 pages, or 94 percent of the records we
have processed, have already been released to the public. In addi-
tion, the FBI has several other much smaller files as a result of
other directly related investigations, such as the investigation of
Marina Oswald, and these files comprise approximately 22,000
pages, 13,000 of which are duplicate, third agency, or unprocessed
pages. Pity eight percent of these pages processed pursuant to the
Freedom of Information Act have been released to the public.

Of the pages available in the FBI reading room on the main floor
at FBI headquarters, approximately 189,000 pages, or 94 percent,
are available in their entiret; . The remaining 12,000 pages in the
reading room reflect some degree of redaction. The information
that has not been disclosed or that has been redacted to some
degree falls within the exemptions that are enumerated in the
Freedom of Information Act and the protections of the Privacy Act.

This includes information that, one, is classified on the basis of
national security; two, would disclose the identities of individuals
who specifically requested confidentiality; three, would disclose the
identities of confidential informants or sources; four, is highly per-
sonal information about individuals; or, five, originated with other
Government agencies and those agencies specifically requested that
the information not be released based upon exemptions applicable
to those particular agencies.

While I strongly favor maximum disclosure under the law, there
are certain types of information that are particularly critical to
successful law enforcement investigations and national security; for
example, information that is properly and appropriately classified,
information that would identify confidential sources, and informa.
tion that would disclose sensitive investigative techniques or the
types of information the disclosure of which could negatively
impact upon our ability to fulfill our mission. Information in FBI
files that has not been disclosed publicly falls largely within these
descriptions of information.

In any case, I believe it is extremel healthy for the country to
have these issues aired and to be resolved. The public interest dic-

SUBJECT: Request No. CIA~-16 from JFK Board
REFERENCE: CSI 97-062 dated 31 January 1997

1. (U) The Office of Personnel Security has researched
this request from the Assassination Records Review Board
relating to the existence of pre-assassination files on Lee
Harvey Oswald.

2. (U) In response to the specific questions listed
in Mr. Marwell’s letter to the Historical Review Group, the
following responses are provided to those three questions
pertaining to the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These
responses are the best reasonable answers based on available
information. Please note OPS was known as the Office of
Security prior to 1 October 1994.

Question 1: (U) Please identify, as specifically as
possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time
of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: (U) At the time of the assassination, the
Office of Security (OS) held two files which contained
information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A file entitled Defectors
File (#0341008) contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald,

and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A‘hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.

(U) In your request specific mention is made of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search of
Oswald’s name did not produce an index reference to any of
these files.

(U) Attached is all of the available information
regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL files. This
information was retrieved fronf__ sido the
Information Management. Branch/Records| ‘Control Section and
from a review of general office administrative files.

Question 2: (U) Other than for the 201-289248 file
on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was
opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and
the documents that were in the file at the time of the
assassination.

Response: (U) As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have
been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

(U0) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
that involved opening incomi and_outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, (China and South
America. In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with
subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and
SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of
mail with the acquired information referred to the
Directorate of Operations.

(U) The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
défecting to other countries and information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This compilation of information was received from press
clippings, Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal
Bureau of. Investigation, the Department of State, and the
various armed services. The pre-assassination documents
located in this file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as
the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer
printout of defectors which reflected limited biographic

from the actual Defectors File; notations within the
Defectors File show the Defector Machine Listing as
permanently charged to the Security Analysis Group of OS.

Question 4: (U) To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
Maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.

Response: (U) It is believed that OS holdings on Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel.to Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of
documents on this person increased, a separate file was
created to be the repository of information on the alleged
American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors
File that a separate file exists on Oswald.

(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.

requesting confirmation that the security support files of
the HTLINGUAL project are not the subject of a current
litigation, investigation, or other inquiry that would
preclude their destruction pursuant to normal guidelines for

Destroy Questionable Records: 141C's for
MHCHAOS and HTLINGUAL Projects, from
IMS/MPG/TIRMB, dated 18 December 1989

1. The referenced request seeks concurrence for the
destruction of MHCHAOS and HTLINGUAL files in accordance with
routine records destruction schedules approved by the National
Archivist. Subject to the qualifications set forth below, the
proposed destruction can proceed without legal objection.

2. -On several occasions over the past 12 years, DO/IMS has
proposed that the Agency identify and destroy MHCHAOS and
HTLINGUAL records in accordance with routine records
destruction schedules. The major reason not to do so has been
the existence of litigation that has necessitated retention of
those records. With the settlement of the National Lawyers‘
Guild litigation, a major obstacle to routine records
destruction appears to have been eliminated.

3. That case alone, however, does not govern the records
retention or_destruction of MHCHAOS or HTLINGUAL files. In
addition, destruction may proceed only in accordance with the
records disposition authorization provided by the Archivist on.
17 March 1978. (dob Nos. NC1-263-77-18 and NC1-263-78-1). The
approval given by the Archivist is subject to essentially the
following conditions: (1) files and documents that are the
objects of FOIA and Privacy Act requests, or those involved in
any other litigation, are not to be destroyed; (2) files that
document the initiation, implementation, and termination of the
projects, and other files on U.S. persons of foreign.
intelligence or counterintelligence value which the Agency is
required to maintain, are not to be destroyed; (3) no disposal
will occur prior to review and concurrence of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence. ‘ .

4. In reviewing the materials you have provided, I have
been able to conclude that then SSCI Chairman, Birch Bayh, in
several separate letters dated 6 April 1978, informed the DCI
that the Committee had no objection ta tha implementation of
the records disposal lists approved by the Archivist. In my


13-00000

we :

view, therefore, condition number (3) haa been satisfied.
Accordingly, with the exception of the case of
United States, there appear to be ‘no ongoing court cases

_f@lating te MHCHAOS or HTLINGUAL files that necessitate the

retention of those materials. All HTLINGUAL materials relating

- to Leo T. Hurwitz, therefore, should be retained. In addition,

any records pertaining to Dr. Sidney M. Peck ( )
should be retained. I am not aware of any other matters that
would require retention of the files at the present time, but
you should contact the Agency's FOIA Coordinator to determine
if there are any outstanding FOIA or Privacy Act requests
‘relating to MHCHAOS or HTLINGUAL that should not be destroyed.
If so, materisis should be retained in accordance with the
requirements of the Records Disposal List. Finally, of course,
information that the Agency must maintain that is of foreign
intelligence value also should not be destroyed. -

4. I would also point ‘out that the terms of the National
Lawyers Guild settlement require that all agencies of the
Federal Government, including the CIA, shall not use, release
or disclose, within or outside the Government, certain
information relating to the National Lawyers Guild and its
subunits. Accordingly, if there is CIA information derived.

- from the FBI's investigation relating to the National Lawyers'

Guild, Agency records, files or indices must be appropriately
marked so as to permit implementation of the settlement
agreement. This means that, to the axtent MHCHAOS records are
not isolated but are contained in other Agency files, some
means of ensuring that the information is not disseminated must
je made.

5. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any
questions.

a. Response to Request: CIA has to provide an official
response that will become a part of the public record. The
response should be a releasable version of your memorandum of
27 February 1997; according to the classification markings, most
of the text is unclassified. I recommend that you send me an
annotated copy indicating what can be released. I will prepare
the response and coordinate it with you. Also please review the
attachments to the memorandum for possible release. The JFK
Board may consider documentation of the destruction of
potentially relevant files as assassination records. HRG will
handle any additional coordination (OGC, DO, etc.) required.

b. Transfer of Oswald’s OS File(#0351164): The original
Office of Security subject file on Oswald currently held by the
Office of Personnel Security should be transferred to the
Historical Review Group. The file will be incorporated into the
Agency‘s JFK Assassination Collection and reviewed for release
under the JFK Act of 1992. Most documents in this file will
probably be duplicates of documents in the HSCA sequestered
matexial held by HRG, however, under the JFK law all “Oswald”
fil ate considered assassination records. The ARRB staff has
asked for access to the file when practical.

Chief, Information nagement Branch

SUBJECT: OSWALD, LEE HARVEY
AIN: 0351164

1. The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31
January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center fdr the Study
of Intelligence (HRG/CSI), via tthe Directorate of
Administration/Information Review Office, with researching pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was,
generated by the John F. Kennedy. Boarats-desire to review and
declassify relevant material. the results of this réview were
forwarded to the WkG/CSI°on 27 February 1997.

2. During the Informa:ion Management Branch’ s
(IMB)xesearch in response to “he. above tasking it was noted that
Volume V of the Oswald files as’ not on the shelf where Volumes
I-IV and VI-VII were located. , search of the entire area where
the volumes had been maintainey failed to locate Volume V. The
IMB Files Section was subsequeyt ly charged with conducting an

page prior to being turned over to HRG/CSI and another attempt
was Thade to locate Volume V or %o locate persons who might know
what happened to it. Volume V was not located nor were any
persons located who were knowleageable of its status.

4. During the complete review of the Oswald files no
“time gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall
ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume V
had been consolidated into other volumes or that Volume V never
existed, but that a numbering errer resulted in what should have
been Volume V being labeled as Volume VI. The use of Roman
numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this
error to occur.

Dear Dr. Gunn: ee ols

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records
No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files) and
No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)

This is a partial response to the ARRB‘s referent
request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had
on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is believed the following comments
and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of
Security questions. The DO response is pending.

1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum
containing information from the Agency's Office of Personnel
Security which provides details about the files it had on
Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they
were created. These. include the Office of Security file on
Oswald, a.general file on Americans who had defected to
another country and information about HTLINGUAL files

2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977
memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which
explains the numbering of that Office’s file on Oswald. In
particular, it explains why the “missing” volume V may never
have existed.

3. An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald
Security file and the file on American defectors.

4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and
those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRB
staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will
be processed according to current release guidelines.

If you have any questions about this response, please

advise.
Sincerely,

J. Barry Harrelson

22 December 1997

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. Pursuant to ARRB “Resquet No. CIA-16,the Office of
Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre-
assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The following
responses are provided to those questions which pertain to
the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are
the best reasonable answers based on available information.
Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to
1 October 1994.

Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as
possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time
of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: At the time of the assassination, the Office
of Security (OS) held two files which contained information
on Lee Harvey Oswald. One file entitled “Defectors File”
(#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and
the second file was Office of Security subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.

2. Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0077826. (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search
of Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any
of these files. Attached is all of the available
information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL
files. This information was retrieved from the Information
Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review
ef general office administrative files.


13-00000

Question 2: For other than the 201-289248 file on
Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the
purpose for the. opening of the file, and the documents that
were in the file at the time of the assassination.

Response: As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been
destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

3.  HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project
involving the opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to
and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South
America. In the Office of Security this project was known
as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER,
INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER. The Office of Security actually
conducted the opening and monitoring of mail with the
acquired information being referred to the Directorate of
Operations.

4. The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa
1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens
defecting to other countries and information regarding
foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.
This file contained information was from press clippings,
Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed
services. The pre-assassination documents located in this
file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959
entitled “U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at
15”

b. Department of State memorandum dated 25 Gctober
1960 with attached list of American “defectors”
from May 1959 to October 1960

¢. Memorandum for Chief/Security Research Staff dated
31 October 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject:
American Defectors


13-00000

d. Memorandum for Deputy Director of Security dated
1 November 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject:
American Defectors

e. Handwritten chart of defectors dated 26 August
1961

f. Defector outline prepared in October 1961 listing
known defectors to the USSR, Red- China, Cuba, and
United Arab Republic.

5. The index reference to the Defectors File
identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as
the Defector, Machine Listing. This listing was a computer
printout of defectors and provided limited biographic data
on each name. This listing was maintained separately from
the actual Defectors File; notations within the Defectors
File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently
charged to the Security Analysis Group of the Office of
Security. Efforts to locate this listing or determine its
disposition have been unsuccessful.

6. Information regarding the purpose of “the Defectors
File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.
An employee of this Office was, recalls the Defector Machine
Listing as being approximately one and one-half inches thick
and in two parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical ,
index of defector names with assigned numbers. The second
part listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and
contained the limited biographic data on each name.

7. The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald
(#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file
was created as a separate repository for the numerous press
clippings and reports received from other government
agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR
and his activities following his return to the’ United
States. The first volume of this file appears to have been
preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents
contained in this file are as follows: Ee

a. Department of State telegram #1304 from Moscow
dated 31 October 1959

b. The Washington Post press clipping dated
1 November 1959 entitled “Ex-Marine Asks Soviet
Citizenship”

Question 4: To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.

Response: It is believed that OS holdings on ,Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of


documents increased, a separate file was created to be the
repository of information on the alleged American defector.
There is a notation in the Defectors File that a separate
file exists on Oswald.

9. Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.

10. The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the
component responsible for collecting, developing, and
evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to
detect and/or. prevent penetration of the Agency's
organization, employees, and activities by foreign or
domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted
research in connection with employee loyalty cases and
maintained records identifying personalities, environments,
and personal traits of individuals who had been of
counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained
liaison with various government agencies in connection with
counterintelligence activities and coordinated the
counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using
organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported
directly to the office of the Director of Security.

11. A representataive of the Office of Personnel
Security /Management Staff was queried regarding the mission
and functions of SRS during the pre-assassination time
period. He made inquiries relating to the above request,
and the OPS/Information Management Officer retrieved retired
policy records for review. The information on the mission
and function of SRS was retrieved from the archived Office
of Security administrative and historical files as well as a
review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens.

DO Response to Board Request CIA - 16

Oswald Pre-Assassination Files

The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO
xecords to determine if there were any additional files
containing pre-assassination records relating to
Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald
201 which appeared. to be a file inventory. The
document identified CI Staff as the file custodian.

CcIc has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were
incorporated into the 201.

Prior té establishing a 201, any documents received
would have been placed in an operational interest file.
We found no reference to the existence of an
operational file. If such a file had existed, however,
it might not have been registered in the central index.
It was standard procedures that upon opening a 201, the
documents from an interest file would be transferred to
the 201. ie :

Given that Oswald was a subject of the HTLINGUAL
operation, it is reasonable to believe that there was a
file on him. We destroyed all of the HTLINGUAL files
under court order, and no record was made of what files
existed. We did not review all of the DO record system
to destroy all copies of matérial which may have been
derived from HTLINGUAL material. We know, for
instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items related to
Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection

In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the
information we are aware of that we had prior to the
assassination.
