MEMCRANDUM FOR: Mr. J. Lee Rankin

SUBJECT: © Anonymous Telephone Calls to United States
Embassy in Canberra, Australia, Relative to
Planned Assassination of President Kennedy

1, I refer again to paragraph two of your memorandum,
dated 12 February 1964, relative to disseminations to the Secret
Service made by CIA.

2. On 24 November 1963, CIA received from the Department
of the Navy a copy of a cable from the Naval Attache in Canberra,
Australia (IN 67327, Top Secret, later downgraded to Secret},
reporting « telephone convereation the previous day with an
anonymous individual who had described himself as a Polish
chauffeur for the Soviet Embassy in that city. This individual,
while discuseing several matters of intelligence interest, touched
on the possibility that the Soviet Government had financed the
asaassination of President Kennedy. Reference was made in this
cable to the receipt of a similar anonymous telephone call on
15 October 1962.

3. Upon receipt of this cable from Navy CIA took the
following action:

a. Gabled to Canberra asking full details of the
telephone conversation of 23 November and the call made
on 15 October 1962. It should be noted that CIA had not
previously known of the 1962 telephone call.
