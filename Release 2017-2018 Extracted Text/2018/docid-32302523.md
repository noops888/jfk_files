On 5/12/61, PCI JIM KELLY, aka, and PG 612-C, both engaged in

numbers racket activities

in New Kensington, Pa., advised

as follows:

Since the article appeared in Pittsburgh newspapers concerning

the Government's intention to have all investigative agencies

cooperate in an attempt to combat organized crime, word has

been passed around in New Kensington gambling circles each

person so engaged should be particularly alert for the presence

of strangers who could be federal agents. Each numbers writer,

horse bookie and sports bookie has been cautioned not to accept

business from people with whom they are not already acquainted

and they are not to accept any telephone wagers unless they

are absolutely certain of the identity of the person calling.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
