SUBJECT: Response to ARRB Questions / Requests
REFERENCE: Memo dtd 6 March 1995 to Ellie Neiman re ARRB Initial Review of Oswald

201 File

1. In response to ARRB the DO has the following answers and /or comments to the
specific questions raised by Mr. Gunn during his review of the OSWALD 20! file.

a. RYBAT- The sensitivity indicator RYBAT is used on correspondence
whenever, in the judgment of the originator and releasing officer, the correspondence
concerns sensitive operational or administrative matters. When used RYBAT will appear
on the slug line along with other pertinent action indicators or cryptonyms to ensure the
protection of sensitive text information.

b. CISIG - the "I'' In SIG stands for " investigations "' and appears in the
Birch O'Neal testimony and also in CSI No. 70-1 dtd 2 March 1955 [ a copy attached
herewith] ; this particular document was released in full in Reel 48 folder 18 of the JFK
microfilm holdings.

c. VR - Indicates that a"’ vital records" copy of the cable message was
provided to the cable secretariat archives for its use in the necessary microfilming of the
message at a later date - this automatic dissemination to VR ensures a good microfilm
image copy for records storage.

d. D-200-5-41 - The ''D"' indicates a processing code used by the records
analyst to place a cross referenced copy of the same document into a particular file other
than the main file . The file number 200-5-41 is the official GPFLOOR file\-all documents
originally assigned to this file have been reclassified to other subject files . The GPFLOOR
file was closéd out with the last document filed dated 26 August 1968 [see JFK Reel 48
folder 29 for a listing of documents processed from this file].

‘: e. SLUG LINE - The crypts released elsewhere in the text of a message are
always protected in the slug line along with other indicators as a method to preclude
reconstitution of DO files; for the release of the crypts in the slug line could build
sufficient information to reconstruct sensitive operational information the DO is trying to
protect.

. f. DO/WH Organizational Chart - [see attached CSI No 70-1 dtd 27 May
1955 and updates written in from cable chrono information ]- the second attachment dtd 5
July 1978 authored by the CIA History Staff answers the original request for this
information.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Norbert Shephanek, PCS / LOC

SUBJECT : Organization Chart for the Deputy Directorate
for Plans (DDP), 1963

REFERENCE : Telecon from N. Shephanek to J. Pfeiffer,
30 June 1978, same subject. esssians

1. In response to your telephone call of 30 June 1978,
History Staff was unable to locate any single chart which
showed the organization of the Deputy Directorate for Plans
as of 1963. We did find a complete set of charts for the
individual Staff Elements, the Functional Divisions, and the
Geographic Area Divisions of the DDP as of 25 February 1963.

2. . Based on the organization charts for these individual
components (including the Office of the DDP), History Staff
has prepared a chart which is believed to be an accurate
reflection of the DDP organization as of 25 February 1963.

3. If you require further details concerning the organ-
ization of the individual components as of the date noted

above, please let me know.
