Details: (U) On 3/28/1997, the ARRB formally advised the FBI,Of

the 'ARRB made determinations.

Re :

(U) 62-HQ-1029205, 05/21/1997

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting

the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular

information, and classified information related to sources and

foreign relations as listed above.

However, the ARRB supports

the position that the information

ordered disclosed is relevant

and

significant to the assassination.

They opine the pertinence

and importance to the assassination outweigh any current harm to

the individuals or the FBI's/United States Government's foreign

relations, informants or operational aspects. At our request,

the ARRB agreed to reconsider their decision on two of the 58

documents at their April meeting; therefore, they are not

addressed in this memorandum.

(U)

The JEKTE will continue to advise CID, NSD and OGC

of the ARRB decisions.

However, due to the narrowed scope of

appeal issues, NSD and CID recommendations will only be sought

for significant matters, none of which are documented in this

memorandum.

If you have questions, please contact Pauline E.

Battle at extension 9299, Carol L. Keeley at extension 9494, or

Carl Valentine at extension 9476.
