Re: (U) 62-HQ-1029205, 05/21/1997

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting
the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular
information, and classified information related to sources and
foreign relations as listed above. However, the ARRB supports
the position that the information ordered disclosed is relevant
and significant to the assassination. They opine the pertinence
and importance to the assassination outweigh any current harm to
the individuals ‘or the FBI's/United States Government's foreign
relations, informants or operational aspects. At our request,
the ARRB agreed to reconsider their decision on two of the 58
documents at their April meeting; therefore, they are not
addressed in this memorandum.

i (U) The JFKTF will continue to advise CID, NSD and OGC
of the ARRB decisions. However, due to the narrowed scope of
appeal issues, NSD and CID recommendations will only be sought
for significant matters, none of which are documented in this
memorandum. If you have questions, please contact Pauline E.
Battle at extension 9299, Carol L. Keeley at extension 9494, or
Carl Valentine at extension 9476.
