hot received any answer.

"In it, I spoke about the telegram which you

sent me and i believe that you have not received it yet.

"You must not think that when there are some

delays in getting my letters for reasons beyond my

control that it means that I have forgotten you.

"I still have not lost hope of finding a solu-

Secret writing text:

"Dear IRMA:

"I received your telegram, also the previous

one which you sent me to ask for the $800.00. I

already wrote to you several days ago in connection

with that.

Tell me whether you want that money in

order to come here and whether there is not going

co be blackmail, as they did with you before, anc

as they also did with me.

I do not say this

you because of distrust,

for you should understand

that for me a good friend is worth much more, and

if getting to know you will cost a hundred and some

odd dollars, this would be very cheap.

So, as you

see, it is not a matter of distrust,

but that we do

not

want to be taken for fools.

is not only the

Communists who have profited from this revolution, but

also many clever people who are moving around us.

believe that I shall be able to get the money for you

and I will let you know as soon as possible.

I am

going to see if I can do some good little job to

resolve the problem and if I have to go to some

other place (?) to work for several weeks to get the

noney so that i can send it to you,

I shall do so, but

I want to help you as a good triend.

"IRMA, do not bother

asking MANOLO GARCIA about

the letters which he has seni me, since I turned them

over to CONTE AGUERO and he has read them. I trust

MANOLO and believed that he will not tell me anything

which is not true. He sends some rather good information,

although they say worse things about Cuba here. It is

about the Russians in

Cuba, etc.

However, you hardly

ever tell us much. The people here are very hopeful

that there will be an internal uprising on the Island.

What do you think about this?

Tell us something about

that;

We

know very little here.

"I have to give you some information which

I want you to check well for me. CHINEA spoke

with the wife of ARMESTOY and she told him that

ARMESTOY had been killed in Havana.

Later, from

some friends of ARVESTOY we learned that he tried

to rent a car in order to go and get his wife, and

that he became suspicious and when they came

to pick

him up, he had a fight with the police.

"REYNALDO, one of the coordinators of the MRR

in Matanzas whom I met in Havana when CHINEA was there,

told us this. REYNALDO came from Cuba about a month

ago and I believe that it was ARMESTOY who brought

him.

He tells me that ARMESTOY was very happy and

that a few days before leaving for Cuba, he called

his wife on the phone and told her that

he was going

to see her in a few days.

If what REYNALDO says 18

ARMESTOY was crazy to do that.

and thought that he had already forgotten us for

The poor man,

when

he did not call us, we believed that he was in New York.

get busy and tell me what you know

about this,

and make any corrections, if necessary"
