(C)1 have been able to determine that OTS currently uses the slug “AQUATIC to indicate that action needs to be taken.
Because the word is in current aperational use, we request that it be protected. The slug (AQUATIC* often appears with "TI ECHS,”
which indicates that the cable contains technical information. If the latter also appears in the cable, please protect it as well.

(C} | had requested a copy of the cable that uses the slug {AQUATIC.” | would like the opportunity to review it in order to
determine if there is any DS&T information in the document that needs protection in addition to the slug.
