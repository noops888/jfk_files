Long to Gebhardt Memo
Re: Alleged tapping of telephone of
U. S. Senator Howard Baker

Gibson advised that during the course of a normal
jworking day two or three men usually enter and work in the
{sub-leased SCI space. They stay during the course of an
lentire day without leaving the space and do not séem to
}conduct business in a normal manner. An unidentified
jfriend of Gibson's overheard individuals in the space,
‘allegedly leased by DEA, discussing "tapes." Based on the
above information and based on Gibson's experience with
wiretapping while employed with the Cobb County, Georgia,

Sheriff's Office, Gibson believes a wiretapping operation
was being conducted in the space allegedly sub-leased by
DEA fram SCI.

Since it appeared that an ongoing CIA operation
was being compromised and th the CIA sh d be aware,
our Atlanta Office perpen atlanta S)
(Covert) and.informed him of @ apove on™7/11/74.

On 7/12/74, Gibson furnished the following:

Directly above Suite 1109, rented by SCI at
1028 Connecticut Avenue, is a suite located on the
twelfth floor, which is utilized as an efficiency apartment.
It is connected to Suite 1109 on the floor. below by stairway.
Gibson said the twelfth floor space is actually the space
sub-leased to Conein and that telephone number 785-4514 is
installed in that space. Conein sub-leased this apartment
in March, 1974, and was still being used by ae as of
1/5/74.

Regarding the information above concerning the
alleged overhearing of discussions concerning "tapes," by
alleged DEA employees, Gibson advised this information
was furnished to him by Mr. Steve Van Cleave, a personal
friend of Gibson's and a private investigator from

tof Georgia. Van Cleave told Gibson that he ‘
visited SCI offices on a recent unrecalled date. Van Cleave
was told by Werbell that van Cleave could not stay in the
offices at that time as Werbell was consulting with a
client. . Van Cleave told Gibson he then went to the twelfth
floor entryway to SCI offices, the space sub-leased by
Conein, and overheard a conversation through the door
