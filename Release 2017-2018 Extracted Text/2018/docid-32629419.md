THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE NATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION CENTER.

1. A STUDY OF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY OF 17, 30 AND 31 JAN 1963

AND 1 FEB 63 REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF SOVIET-CONSTRUCTED VERTICAL

WELLS IN AREA BETWEEN 22-37N 83-21W AND 22-57N 83-10W. QUALITY

OF PHOTOGRAPHY RAN FROM FAIR TO GOOD WHILE WEATHER CONDITIONS

RANGED FROM CLEAR TO SCATTERED CLOUDS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT

DIAMETER OF THESE WELLS (THREE TO FOUR METERS) AND CAMOUFLAGE

NETTING, COULD PREVENT IDENTIFICATION OF SUCH WELLS ON PHOTGRAPHY

UTILIZED. HOWEVER, NO MILITARY ACTIVITY OR GROUND SPOIL ORDINARILY

ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TYPE CONSTRUCTION WAS OBSERVED.

2. NO INDICATIONS OF MILITARY ACTIVITY OR MATERIEL STORAGE WERE

FOUND AT BUENAVISTA MINE (22-55N 83-D2W). PROBABLE ORE PROCESSING
