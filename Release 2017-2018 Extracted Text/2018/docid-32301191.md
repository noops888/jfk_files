on ‘12/18/61, PG 615-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III &

as follows: i

In his opinion, the raid at the Mannarino gambling casino - ‘fh

horse room in New. Kensington, Pa., on August 24, 1961, by IRS,

Pittsburgh, was ill-advised, shortsighted and poorly planned. \

Memorandum

ro - : DIRECTOR, FBI (92-2914)(92-2918) pare: 18/3760.

ix : SAC, PITTSBURGH (92-236)(92-228)

For two years, PG 615-C has been attempting to obtain increasing ®
petter information about the Mannarinos, their illegal,.
activities, their associates and their future plans. He

has done this without any thought of, or desire for monetary
compensation, simply-because of his firm conviction that

the MANNARINO "strangle-hola" on all phases of life and
activity in the New Kensington area had to be broken.

In spite of the obvious dangers.to his professional reputation
and personal safety, he commenced a process of infiltration
due to his belief that such things cannot be left to

“somebody else.”

By frequenting gambling establishments, PG 615-C met many
of the MANNARTNO employees, and by performing small favors
for them, professional and otherwise, he became friendly
with most of “them and the confidant of some of them.
They furnished considerable’ information, some more valuable
than others, but a compendium of their bits of information
was forming a gradually clearing picture of the entire |
MANNARINO operation.”

Being careful

to make his personal contacts with them casual and seemingly

innocuous, ,PG 615-C was slowly accomplishing his plan to

have: the MANNARINOS, after doing their normal check on
him, accept him.into that group of prominent, local business
and professional people with whom they associate on a

social basis.

in the Wew Kensington area that there is very little

Rees ae Office.

PG 615-C is certain, in his own mind, that .the "big guys”

will once again escape indictment and that the most that EE

In view of the above, PCI HERBERT LEE RAY, RD#3,- Leechburg,
Pa., GABRIEL. MANNARINO's neighbor, was contacted on 12/18/61,
by SA FORSYTH, and PCI RAY was asked why he had furnished

so little information in recent months. PCI RAY advised:

Prior to the “Federal raid on the MANNARINO gambling joint
in New Kensington. towards the end of summer,” 1961, he
observed some activity around GABRIEL MANNARINO's cottage

near Leechburg. While there were never any groups of visitors,

except for one family-type outdoor picnic, occasionally _
individuals.would visit the cottage. Also, GABRIEL
MANNARINO was observed to leave the house almost daily at
varying hours. Since "the raid," GABRIEL MANNARINO

has developed what amounts almost to a predictable pattern.
He leaves the: cottage on most days shortly before noon,
always alone, and he returns to stay at about eight o'clock
in the evening. Visitors are extremely rare and never stay
more than a few minutes. PCI has not ‘been able to obtain
any information of recognizable pertinence and, therefore,
has not contacted SA FORSYTH.

on 12/18/61, PCI ANTHONY JOHN WISE, JR., Pittsburgh, Pa.,
employed as Manager of the MANNARINO-owned Ken Iron ‘and
Steel Co:, New Kensington, was asked by SA FORSYTH why he
has not been furnishing and pertinent information during
the recent past, and he advised:

Even before the "Government raid” in: New Kensington in
August 1961, he was not taken into the confidence of the
MANNARINOS as’ regards anything but their scrap metals and
gas well businesses. They put him in charge of these two
ventures because of his education and prior experience.
However, on occasion he overheard: conversations involving
some of their other interests and observed them meet some
of their:associates and/or employees. Since the. raid, he
has not seen GABRIEL MANNARINO more than three times and
understands that GABRIEL MANNARINO is spending most of his
time at his cottage near Leechburg, Pa., while SAM MANNARINO
spends the largest portion of each day at his restaurant,
The Bonfire, “located a few miles from Leechburg." From
what he has been able to observe and learn, SAM MANNARINO

-and GABRIEL MANNARINO see very little of each other or of

their erstwhile associates. PCI does not feel that he can

obe for information from either, MANNARINO without arousing
Bret suspicions. because it has ‘pet ARE habit to observe
and listen but not to ask questions.

on 12/19/61, PG.612-C,, who,is an experienced numbers writer
in the MANNARINO operation iMnNew Kensington, was asked about
the dearth of pertinent information being received, and
informant advised:

The town (New Kensington) has been closed down almost
completely, as regards gambling, since the "Federal raid
last summer" and since the commencement of the FGJ inquiry.
Besides the numbers racket, which is down in volume by at
least half, there are only three card games in the city,
only one of whichis operating on any given night. Horse
bets, sports bets and dice games have been eliminated,
allegedly by orders of. the MANNARINOS. : Men who have been
for years employed in one phase or another of the MANNARINO
gambling set-ups are now loafing about town, and their
principal topics of discussion concern the FGJ hearings,
their belief that the newly-elected reform administration
in New Kensington will not allow resumption of open gambling,
and their "fears" concerning their own futures. With
regard to the numbers racket, elaborate security measures
have been put into effect, and only those possessing the
Federal Wagering Tax Stampcare permitted to participate.
In view of these facts,. pertinent information has been scarce
. and unreliable. ;

Spot surveillances at residences, legitimate business sites
and at known hangouts during the past four months have been
wholly unproductive and tend to substantiate the comments of
the above mentioned informants.

Due to the situation created by the IRS raid on August eu,

1961, and the resultant FGJ probe, as it affects receipt

py the Pittsburgh Office of positive information concerning

the MANNARINOS and their activities, the Pittsburgh office

has found it impossible to comply fully with Bureau instructions
concerning submission of a daily teletype summary of pertinent
developments.

As matters now stand, the, only readily discernible method
of collecting current positive information concerning either
MANNARINO is by establishing highly. confidential sources.
