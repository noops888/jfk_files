SUBJECT: Philip Burnett Franklin Agee

1. NAME OF OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE: Elsie l. Scaletti

2. PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT:

I knew Phil during the entire time he was in

Branch I at Headquarters, and during his tour in

Mexico.

• We came to Mexico PCS at the same time.

This means I knew him from 1965 until he resigned.

In Headquarters our relationship was

limited to

business in the office,

and that was not very

frequent. We sat in different rooms.

He handled SE

matters. I did the routing of all Branch

correspondence which meant I decided what he was to

see--this was anything affecting Soviet/Satellite/

Chinese matters.

My main areas of responsibility

were in

the support field.

Even though we were both

processing out at the same time, we did not exchange

stories much.

However, since / traveled as a

"Tourist" and was not therefore allowed to bring

anything into Mexico,

Phil offered to have some of

my things packed with his household effects since

he said he owned hardly anything. One day my husband

and I took some boxes of things over to his apartment

before work.

I do not remember the name of the

apartment development in Virginia, but

it was the

garden type. His apartment was nice-- fairly new

but sparsely furnished. He helped us unload the things

aid take them upstairs. Then we parted. I seem to recal:

ile had some trouble with his car that morning and we

dropped him off at a repair shop on the way to the

office.

At this time, in Washington, Phil was very

pleasant, was nice to work with.

He did not appear

to be pushy, even though hedid everything he could

to get the Mexican assignment.

At this time, despite

his

family problems,

he did not appear to let these

affect iris work. At

least from my position he seemed

to get his work done,

not to procrastinate, not to

take a

lot of time off. Fron the gossip I heard?

was anxious to get any assignme..t

was sympathetic toward him also, and was happy to be

able to help Phil at this particular time.

In Mexico when Prites Houseirold effects arrived

he let me know; and

as I recall, ne brought them over

to my rouse and we unloaded them into our apartment.

We did not go and pick them up.

In

thanks,

quasi was

Conversation was light. During dinner, as I recall,

we talked about business in Mexico, and he mentioned

his father was in the dry cleaning

business, and

he thought he might be interested in bringing into

Mexico some used dry cleaning equipment which

is worth

nothing in the United States, and set up some dry

cleaning establishments in Mexico.: The discussion

was merely in generalities--nothing specific as to

timetable or even if Phil were serious about this.

About a week later Phil brought his car over and

my husband helped him work on his car--adjusting it

to the altitude. This must have been around September

1907.

Shortly thereafter, when Laura B. UTSTINE was

in Mexico TDY (she worked in WH/l and also knew Phil

at Headquarters), Phil had my husband, me,

and UTSTINE

over to his apartment (on Insurgentes

sur just off the

Viaducto) for dinner. It was a huge apartment,

sparsely

furnished. We had an

enjoyable evening, very

conversation. Talked mostly

about Mexico. At this time

he showed us he had several

bedrooms (forget.how many)

and hopefully his sons would be able to visit him.

Juring his tour in Mexico I only saw Phil in the

station occasionally--and then lust in passinain the

Once after I heard about Phil's having kidnaj ec

his boys,

I thought I saw them (can't remember why l

I never saw

phil in the Embassy proper nor at

any Embassy functions I was tourist and did not

circulate in the Embassy).

During his tour

Phil remained pleasant

but was certainl hate find to talk to.. After Phil

resigned I saw him once. After John PROBERT arrived

as COS, I saw

He has had a difficult

would be to BKTRUST's

disadvantage now for

the two to meet. For this reason,

and to assess

ex-LIADLIB-s present state of mind, Headquarters

sent someone to talk with LIADLIB. in the spring

of 1972.

At that time he still seemed bitter

against BKTRUST.
