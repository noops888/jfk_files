NAME OF OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE: _Elsie 1. Scaletti
PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT:

1 knew Phil during the entire time he was in
Branch | at Headquarters, and during his tour in
Mexico. We came to Mexico PCS at the same time.

This means {| knew him from 1965 until he resigned.

in Headquarters our relationship was limited to
business in the office, and that. was"‘not very:-
frequent. We sat in different rooms. He handled SB
matters. 1 did the routing of all Branch
correspondence which meant | decided what he was to
see--this was anything affecting Soviet/Satellite/
Chinese matters.. My main..areas of responsibility
were in the support field. Even though we were both
processing out at the same time, we did not exchange
stories much. However, since | traveled as a
"Tourist" and was not therefore allowed to bring
anything into Mexico, Phil offered to have some of
my things packed with his household effects since

he said he owned hardly anything. .One day my husband
and {| took sone boxes of things over to his apartment
before work. {| do not remember the name of the
apartment development in Virginia, ‘but it was the
garden type. His apartment was nice--fairly new

but sparsely furnished. He helped usi),unload the things
aid take them upstairs. Then we parted. | seem to recal
ine had some trouble wita his car that morning and we
dropped him off at a repair shop on the way to the
office. :

At this time, in Washington, Phil was very
pleasant, was nice to work with, He did not appear
to be pushy, even though hedid everything he could
to get the Mexican assignment. At this time, desoite
his family problems, he did not appear to let these
affect inis work. At least from my position he seemed
to get his work done, not to procrastinate, not to
take a lot of time off. From the gossip | heard,
he was separated, and was anxious to get any assignmest
overseas. When the possioility of this Olympic job
opened up in Mexico he grabbed it. As | recalls C/WH/1
was sympathetic toward him also, and was happy to be
able to nelp Phil at this particular time.

In Mexico wien PATT*s nouseirold effects arrived
he let me know; and as 1 recall, ne brought them over
to my iijouse and we unloaded them into our apartment.
We did not go and pick them up. In thanks, we
invited him over to supper one evening. (Willard C.
CURTIS had given permission for individual officers
to have Phil over to dinner if no outsiders were
present and prior permission was obtained.) 1 think
1 got permission fron the DCOS at that time. There
were only the three of us (Phil, my husband, ‘and
myself--no maid, no other invited.guests) There was
no discussion of office. My husband knew Phil was with
BKTRUST and was working on the Olympics in Mexico.
Conversation was light. During dinner, as t recall,
we talked about business in Mexico, and he mentioned,
his father was in the dry-cleaning business, and
he thought he might be interested in’ bringing into
Mexico some used dry cleaning equipment which is worth
nothing in the United States, and set up some dry
cleaning establishments in Mexico.. The discussion
was merely in generalities--nothing specific as to
timetable or even if Phil were sertous about this.

About a week later Phil brought his car over and
my husband helped him work on his car--adjusting it
to the altitude, This must have been around September
1987. :

Shortly thereafter, when Laura B. UTSTINE was
in Mexico TDY (she worked in WH/1] and also knew Phil
at Headquarters), Phil had my husband, me, and UTSTINE
over to his apartment (on Insurgentes Sur just off the
Viaducto) for dinner, bt was @ huge. apartment, sparse ky
furnished. We had an enjoyable evening, very light
conversation. Talked mostly about Mexico, At this time
he showed us he nad several bedrooms (forget how many)
and hopefully his sons would be able to visit him.

During his tour in Mexico | only saw Phil in the
Station oceasionally--and then just in passingin the
halls. Once after | heard about Phil's having kidnapec
his boys, | thought | saw them (can't remember why |
thought they were his) in front of the Embassy with a
maid. | never saw Phil in the Embassy proper nor at
any Embassy functions (1 was tourist and did not
circulate in the Embassy).

During his toug in Mexico, Phil remained pleasant
but was certainlves fiud to talk to. After Phil
resigned | saw him once. After John PROBERT arrived
as COS, | saw Phil along the side of the Embassy.

We Just greeted: euch other. he said he heard. PRODERT
was coming to Mexico and asked if he were here, He
wanted to call and say bello. | said yes. 1
immediately informed PROBERT, and suggested tie
latter; read Phil's file at tie Station as it was
my understanding there was sone propiem about his |
resignation, but did not know all the details.
(This was true as personnel matters in the Station
were kept very close by the front office.) 1 do
not know if, when, or how many times .PROBERT might
have met wita Phil. At this time Poil looked neat
and well kept, as | recall.

3. SUBJECT'S KNOWLEDGE OF SCALETTI, PROJECTS, OR
OPERATIONS IN WHICH SCALETTI PARTICIPATED

a). Phil could definitely identify me as a long-
time BKTRUST employee

b). Phil probably knew that Mexico was my first overseas,
assignment, and possibly..that 1 had a medical
hold before. He knew | had spent “many years"
in Branch 1, and was privy to almost everything
going on at tne Mexico City Station. He
knew | was assigned to Mexico under tourist
cover but worked inside the Embassy. He knew
my husband was here “as a professor at the Universit
of the Americas, and that he did not work for BKTRUS

c). In Headquarters Phil knew | handled mo: tlyjthe

He support projects olus such extras as LI INKland
o% (LBGLOBE PA. LILINKInad closed down either
just as OND Branch, or just before.
However, G = INDER, formerly with Linky")

was assigned to the Branci then, and talked with
Phil about Mexico, and possibly about LKLINK)*U
remember keeping the(LPGLOBE material very close,
doin my own safe, and | do not think Phil knew of
oz CLPBLOBE (LIREALM was then in Mexico undeg. (LPBLOBE),
but may have learned of, (LPBLOBE program afd LIREALM
through Ex-LIADLIB (see paragraph 4).

In Mexico City Phil knew | was in the Cuban section,
and privy to all operations being run against the
Cuban target. He did not know of operations in
particular except possibly LIARM-1 (now terminated)
who we hoped to use against the Cuban olympic
target. The Cuban Section tried to talk with Phil
many times about the Cuban ge legat lone to the .
: Olympics, but as | recall, C/Cuba only succeeded in

GETTING Phil to cone to our end of the hall

a couple of times. | was not in on the
discussions between C/Cuba (Raymond F. FRADYER)
and Phil, but 1 believe they were mainly held
to see who Phil aad met who might be useful
against the Cuban target. |. know we thought at
the time Phil was spending almost full time on his
overt activities and the §B target, and he gave

with LIADLIB-1 who was pressing.to get overseas
as mucn as Pinil, for different reasons. Ex- |

- LIADLIB-1 was @ much more pusty individual, less

exoerienced operationally (rignt out of tre JOT
program) .and out to benefit nimself entirely-~
mucn more so than: Phil 24 LLADLIB-1 went out
constantly, ‘talking of ideas (for nimself),

also quite open in nis bragging ne had been hired

as a GS-13 (I think it was) and did not have to go
up tueuranks. This might heve irritated Pail who
was still a 12. Ex-LIADLIB came to Mexico PCS about
the same time Pnil and | came. Although | rememoer
no close friendsni. detween Ex-LIADLIB and Phil

on the desk, the fact they sat together, were

poth processing out for Mexico, would have meant
they nad something in common. Also, LIADLIB was then
nandling all the projects for CP and leftist
penetration operations for tie Station and Base
(Monterrey). Phil would have more than casual
interest in sone of these as sone were being handled

in the field by Hower’ R. BENJAYA, an old Frigad of

Ex-LIADLIB ever met socially in Mexico or not.

1 am quite certain their work paths never crossed,
LIADLIB is still in Mexico. He has had a difficult
time since his "resignation" getting a job,
keeping a job, and making ends meet. It probably
would be to BKTRUST's disadvantage now for

the two to meet. For this reason, and to assess
ex-LIADLIB-s present state of mind, Headquarters +
sent soneone to talk with LIADLIB-1 in the spring
of 1972. At that time he still seemed bitter
against BKTRUST. :

Other than wishing to make special mention of
EX-LIADLIB-1, | know of no Agency personnel

other than those in WH/1 and. the’ Mexico City Statio
whom. he knew.

OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL

1 know of none except the Olympic Attache in Mexico
under whom Agee worked fron July 1967 until the
end of the Olympics.
