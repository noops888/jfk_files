at his residence.

In adaition, the following investigaion

has been conducted at the residence of ALEX in order for

this office to be furnished with current and valuable

information concerning the day to day activity of ALEX:

In view of the fact that ALEX has all his mail

addressed to him at his mother's residence in Evergreen

Park, Illinois, and since he visits there at least once

or twice a week, constant contact is maintained with

the following sources:

Sergeant MICHAEL A. SERRITELLA

who. knows

him very well, and enjoys a certain amount of his

confidence and who lives two blocks. from ALEX's mother

in Evergreen Park.

Sergeant SERRITELLA has agreed to,

and does, frequently drive past ALEX's mother's house

to observe the activity there.

Contact has also been

maintained with two of the neighbors who reside across

the street from ALEX's mother:

Mr. and Mrs. JOSEPH

VINCENT and HENRY TORBERG.

The following contacts have been made in

attempts to insure that the activities and associates

of ALEX at his residence are made known to this office:

On February 27, 1958, GEORGE HIRSCHEL, the

garage attendant who works days at the garage where the

subject keeps cars which he uses, advised that "RYAN",

the alias used by ALEX at his residence, does not keep

his

car in the garage where HIRScHeL works (at subject's

residence), and that even if "RYAN" did keep the car

there, HIRsCHEL would not advise about it.

He was

very belligerent and non-cooperative.

On about March 10, 1958,

the elevator operator at the

subjectis residence, 4300

North Marine Drive, who worked the 4:00 PM to midnight

shift, furnished information concerning "RYAN" and was

most cooperative until June, when he was fired by the

management for refusing to perform extra duties for

which he was not paid. [

cooperative source, but also took his association with

fact that he became intoxicated and did not report to

work for a

three week period.

During the time he

cooperated with this office, he furnished substantial

Information concerning AlEX, including identifying

information regarding the chauffeur-bodyguard of ALEX,

"BUTCH" LADON, the cars LADON drove, taxi numbers, and

he also furnished information about

the comings and

goings of ALEX and his wife and their visitors, although

not on the large scale that

was able to.

On May 20, 1950, THOMAS MC GANN, 2222 Giddings,

an elevator operator on the 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM shift

at 4300 North Marine Drive, was contacted by SA ROEMer.

He furnished some information regarding ALEX, but not

He was contacted once or twice a week from

May 20, 1958, until July 22, 1958.

During that time,

ALEX and his

wife were not at their residence, due to

the fact that ALEX was evading a subpoena of the Senate

Rackets Committee. During that time, MC GANN advised

that he had not seen ALEX or his wife, but on each

contact he promised that as soon as he observed that

ALEX or his wife had returned to their residence, he

would immediately so advise this office.

He gave no

indication that he would not fully cooperate with this

office in that matter. This continued until July 22,

1958, when independent information was received that

and his wife had returned to Chicago.

He was

contacted that date and he advised that he had not seen

either of them but again promised that as soon as he

did, he would immediately contact SA ROEMER telephonically..

On the evening of July 22, 1958, after Mrs. ALEX had

been observed at her residence by SA ROEMER, MC GANN

was recontacted by the agent.

He advised again that he

had not observed either ALEX or his wife,

and then

stated that he was "not going to talk" to the agent

any more.

When asked for a clarification of his attitude

and the reason for his apparent change of mind, MC. GANN

would only say that he did not want to be "found inan

alley some night."

He stated that it was SA ROEMER' s

job to keep in touch with ALEX and not his, and that

such was what SA ROEMER got paid for, not him.. MC GANN

was most adamant in his refusal to agree to a recontact

or to furnish any information whatsoever regarding ALEX.

He has not been recontacted since July 22, 1958.

On July 30, 1958, JOSEPH MEREHAUT, 4628 North

Dover, elevator operator on the 4:00 PM to midnight

shift, was contacted.

He agreed to furnish information

regarding ALEX and did so on that occasion. He was

most cooperative on that occasion and noted that it was

a civic reponsibility to cooperate with an organization

like the fBl, and that he knew his identity would be

fully protected. He agreed to recontact by SA ROEMER,

but stated that he did not remain in his rented room

only to sleep,

and that he had no phone there.

He

suggested that he be recontacted on the following

advised that MEREHAUT

eats at their residence on each

wednesday night, and that they will attempt to "pump"

him and then furnish any information which they can obtain

regarding ALEX to SA ROEMER. They were requested to

do so.

On August 8, 1958, WILLIAM HOPKINS, 901

Lawrence,

elevator

operator on the 8:00 AM to

4:00 PM shift, was contacted at his residence (as

above). HOPKINS advised that although

he has worked at 4300 North Marine Drive for four

years, it is just recently that he has become an elevator

operator, formerly having been a garage attendant in

the lower level of the garage. It is noted that ALEX

keeps the cars he uses in the upper level which is

attended by HIRSCHEL,

HOPKINS advised that he

knows "RYAN" and his wife as tenants at 4300 North

Marine Drive, but that he has not

seen them in the past

or three months there.

It is noted that ALEX

and his wife have been absent therefrom from the first

part of May to date except for three or four days

and this would account for HOPKINS' failure to observe

them.

As in the case with the above interviewees,

HOPKINS was advised that any contact with the FBI. and

any information which he furnishes would be kept strictly

confidential, and that there

is no way for ALEX to learn

of it unless

through HOPKINS.

He was advised not to

mention his contact with this office to anyone.

HOPKINS

agreed to keep his eyes and ears open for ALEX and his

wife, and to report any information of possible interest

regarding them to this office.

He furnished his phone

EDgewater 4-4427, and

stated that he could be

contacted at any time after 4:30 PM.

Contact with A. C. JAWAREK and Mr. NEWBERGER,

However,

they have been of very little assistance.

They continue

to point out that they are not in a position to know

of ALEX's comings or goings, his activities, his

associates, or anything else which may be of assistance

The only information they havé ever

furnished has been that ALEX, as RYAN, continues to pay

rent for an apartment there.

When ALEX was being sought

by this office as a missing witness of the Senate

Rackets Committee, they advised only that someone,

unknown to them and in their absence, paid ALEX's rent

every month by dropping cash in an envelope on their

desk. They have advised that they are unable to find

ALEXUs application for the apartment which he executed

when he moved in.

They have also advised that they do

not know whether ALEX keeps a car in the garage stall

which he pays rent on. In summation,

they profess

cooperation but have never gone out of their way to

obtain any information and it is suspected that they

could furnish more if so inclined.

Concerning WILLIAM HOPKINS, abOvE, It is

reported herein that RAY LONGTREE,

who is now under

development as a PCI, advised that he knows that ALEX

pays HOPKINS to report visits of FBI Agents to the

Murray Hill Apartments, and that it was HOPKINS who

told MAREHAUT that he had better not cooperate with

the FBI.
