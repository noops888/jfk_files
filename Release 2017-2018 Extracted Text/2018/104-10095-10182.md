SPOT REPORT

SUBJECT:

Willem Oltmans and

DATE:

29 August 1977

George de Mohrenschildt

REFERENCE: UPI Press Tickler

DESCRIPTION: (FYI)

1. According to an article in the 1 April 1977 Washington Star,

George de Mohrenschildt, who had befriended the Oswalds in 1962, had

attempted suicide four times in 1976. As a result he was committed for

mental care to the Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas in the fall of

1976.

He was released on 30 December 1976.

In early January 1976, according to Willem Oltmans, a Dutch

journalist working for Dutch television, who had known de Mohrenschildt since

at least 1967 and perhaps earlier, de Mohrenschildt told Oltmans that he

was writing a book entitled I'm a Patsy, I'm a Patsy. It purports to tell

the whole story of the conspiracy and, according to Oltmans, described how

de Mohrenschildt considered himself responsible for Oswald's actions. The

book has not been published and the manuscript is apparently in the hands of

de Mohrenschildt's lawyer, Pat S. Russell of Dallas. Oltmans is cited in a

Washington Star article of 31 March 1977 as stating that de Mohrenschildt

had once said that "'I only made up the story (about Oswald) because every-

body makes a million dollars off the Kennedy assassination, and I haven't

3. In early March 1977, Willem Oltmans appeared before the House

Assassinations Committee to tell about de Mohrenschildt's decision to tell

his version of the Kennedy murder.. It was this appearance before Committee

staffers that prompted the panel to send Gaeton Fonzi, an investigator, to

Palm Beach in an attempt to question de Mohrenschildt.

Fonzi located where

de Mohrenschildt was staying in Palm Beach but was unable to see de

Mohrenschildt. The latter shot himself with a 20-gauge shotgun on

29 March 1977, in the home of Mrs. Charles Tilton, III, a relative by

marriage, about six hours before the interview was to take place.:

Understanding (MOU) was introduced by the Director and

after several exchanges, Mr. Blakey noted that he felt

these agreements could be worked out by September. Both the

such a problem.

discuss the NDA and MOU.
