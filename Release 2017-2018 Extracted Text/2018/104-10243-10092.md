MEMORANDUM FOR FHE RECORD ud

SUBJECT: Relations with Manolo RAY and the LiRP

1, For background see my memorandum of 1é May !961, rezorting on
my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto
BETANCOURT. As will be noted in that memorandum, ano!o promised to
come us wits a prospectus within approximately ten days! time, alter. con-
sulting with hie leaders in Cuba.

2. On} Jone (961 Mr. Barnes called me to say that Sr. Goodwin had

been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT who asked for immediate financlal - ¢

suppert for certain activities of the MAP which would run arounc $1), Cou
dollare. Mr. Barnes asked me to contact BETANCOURT for the pur ;ose of
aecertaining what the {unde were to be used for, exactly how much needed, ete.
Tcalled BETANCOURY and he told me that I should get these details from

CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying at room 539 at the wasbington Hotel. o

I called Eugenio and made a data for aie and Zay DuBois (Ray Adams ts me
meme he uses with Rey and Cisneros) to call upon him. ‘ve called on CISNEROS:
at approximately 1835 boure I Juno, and be informer: us that he had urgent :
need for pesos for use in support of his saboisge and underground activities

in Cuba. He said. bis people were absolucly without funds, needed money for: *
ying expenses, transportation, parchare of sabotage 2G) for
couriers, and for assisting people co get out of prison, He saidtharitwas = 5
Row possible for people to buy their way out of prison by bribing one of the
meny ‘communist lewyors and judges, ‘He thought that 4u, Cov or 60, Lot
would meet immediate needs and that sore sort of arrangement should be made.
to receive funds ~ 3G, 00 monthly or theresbouts - on a fixed and permanent
basic.

H
pase his plea along to the interested people, 1 reminded him that we had acked |
dim and Manolo to prezare a plan for consideration and that we were still
waiting for that plan, 1 said I personally doubted that anything could be dene

until the plan was received from RAY. He-said Manolo was planning to. come to.
Washington on the afternoon of - June with the plan, but chat he himself was

3. We made no commitment to Eugenio other than to eay that we would

money slresdy in Cuba - dollars would be delivered to owners of the pesos who tf

ere in Miami). I told him I would call him in the morning to let him know how

things stood.

4. Idiecuseed our meeting with CISNEROS with Tracy Barnes on the
moraling of 2 June. It was Tracy's opinion, in which I heartily concur, that
we should put ‘out no money whatscever until ve have had a'chance to examine
Manolo's plan and to study just what resercussions or ran:ifications there
would be, policy-wise and otherwise, toa decision to assist the MRP
enilaterally; that is, owside the Council and presumably without MIRO's J
Knowledge or consent. Since RAY has withdrawn his grous from the Council i
with a grea: deal of fanfare, it is most unlikely that MIRO would look xindly cates
Stance to RAY, eevecially since he fecls he has a rather firm
promise from the President to deal only through MIRO. 7

5. RAY, upon arrivel in Washington, will presumably take his plan (along
with BETANCOURT) directly to Mr. Goodwin and I would algo preaume that
Goodwin will pase it down to Tracy and Tvacy to us. Ray DuBoie, wio hae
been Manolo's case olficer, is standing by in tbe event he should be needed.

6. I personally feel very strongly thet we should do ndthing to suszort the ~~
plan, whatever it is, until wo have received from the White House and the
Departmeat clear-cut, unequivocal policy guidance on the overall plan. Ialso : |
feel that now is the time, if'we are so ing to eupport the MRP unilaterally, to
insert # non-official cut out into the operation. I would recommend that con-
olderation Le given to using Mr. harry Pieper. (a #AVE contract employee) H
em skis job, Harry i aiiy sulied, has a good business head, H
fluent In Spanieh (lived <8 years in Cuba), is cleared, followa directions,
completely bonest and tremendously conscientious.. It would be harder to
find a better person.

1. Also, 1 would like to point out the security riske inherent in any arrange-
mente with the RAY-BETANCOURT-CISNEROS trio. These fellows have had
easy access to the White House and to the Depart=ent, are notorious for their t
“planned leaks”, will probably presume all the Department officials they deal
with are privy to the arrangement, and before we know it the whole exile
community will be well aware that we are providing financial and material
Support to the RAY group. [am not arguing against providing such support,
but am merely pointing out the real potential for embarrassment to us if the
matier fe not handled with the greatest of precautions, I feel they have become | :
too closely identified with U, S, -offictaldom, including ruyself, and that the : i
Plausible denial aspects, to date at ieast, are almost non-existent. 7 i
