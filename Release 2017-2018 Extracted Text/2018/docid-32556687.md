Dear Sir:

As you know, since the letter of your Office of February

1959;

the

above named

person was held under control each year when he came

to switzerland for his winter-holidays. In this letter he was

described as a well-known gangster in the United-states and as a

member of the Chicago crime syndicate. For this reason, your

services asked for a discreet check of his activities and contacts

while in Switzerland. With letter of April 22, 1959, your office

sent us a photograph of this man in order to facilitate searches.

With letter of May 12, 1959,

we received from your Office subject's

fingerprints, taken in USA under

Vr. 4244200 and under the name of

Alex Gus.

With letter of January 7,

sent to your office copy of a

letter handwritten by ALEX and

addressed to Baur-au-Lac Hotel in

Zurich.

we forwarded to your office a

M nunher D074551, issued in Onteago dr 3/21/65 (date of birth

April 1, 1916).

With letter of January

17,.1964,

we informed you that AlEX had:

telephon contacts with nr. 312 GA 38675 in Evergreen Park/Ill.

(this number appears again in subsequent letters of our office).

We sent you also 2 photographs taken at the Schlosshotel in

Pontresina, showing Alick and FUEGuR Dietgard, as well as a copy

of the note of

arrival at the said hotel filled in by Alex.

• forwarded to your oilice a

de? at lette holes and sue men arrit at tich apart.

With letter of January 14, 1965,

we sent to you another copy of

hotel control note filled in by ALEX at the Schlosshotel in

Pontresina.

DuE to your various regughts or searchestand control of Alia

stays and contaota in Switzerland, the zurich Police proposed

an interdiotion of entry in Switzerland against AhiX who, on the

"base of the informations received from USA, must be considered

an undesirable foreigner. Therefore, a respective interdicuion

entry was pronounged against Alut da February 3, 1965 meTer

Federal Office dealing with foreigners. This measure was now sea

to ALEX on his

return to Chicago (letter of Chicago Police dated"

March 16, 1965). Subsequently, AlEX appealed against this order of

interdiction of

entry, pretending that the banished person was not

identical with him.

On the base of the examination of hotel note copies,

passpont copy

and the photographe mentioned above, the Swiss Federal Office

dealing with Foreigners comes to the assumption that

the person

who was the subject of your requests and the interdiction of

entry

Into Switzerland may be two different persons. Due to these facts,

ALEX will be allowed to enter Switzerland on a further visit at

Therefore, we ask you to kindly let have made a new check in your

country, on the base and by comparison the documents sent by you

(photograph and fingerprints) and the pieces sent by us (copies of

hotel notes, copy of passport with photograph and photographs

taken in Zurich and Pontresina) in order to establish whether we

are in front of two different persons named ALEX Gus, forwarding

us the results of this enquiry at your earliest convenience.

Very truly yours,
