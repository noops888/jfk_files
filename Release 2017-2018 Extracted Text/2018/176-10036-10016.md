TIMÉ: OF THE MID- (PRTN GARBLED BEING SERVICED) ARE READY TO PARTICIPATE

IN CASE OF FIGHTING (FIELD COMMENT: SEE

FOR A

PREVIOUS REPORT ON NUMBERS OF MERCENARIES IN ELISABETHVILLE).

40 MILITARY SUPPLIES

ARE NOW BEING SENT TO ELISABETHVILLE

FROM SAKANIA, INSTEAD OF KIPUSHI WHICH WAS THE PORT FROM WHICH

SUPPLIES WERE DISTRIBUTED UNTIL RECENTLY, WHERE A NEW SUPPLY

• BASE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. GOODS ARE TRANSPORTED IN TRUCKS OVER

SECONDARY ROADS TO AVOID UN SURVEILLANCE.

5• APART FROM THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A STRONG MILITARY

INSIDE THE COMMUNES IS BECOMING HIGHLY EMBARASSING TO THE KATANGA

CLASH REGULARLY WITH POLICE WHO HAVE BEEN ORDERED TO BE STRICT

AND ARE TRYING TO KEEP ORDER.

6. SEVERAL HUNDRED GENDARMES ACCUSED OF ROBBERIES AND

SERIOUS INDISCIPLINE HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY AND RETURNES BOR

TO THEIR VILLAGES DURING THE PAST MONTH. HOWEVER, MORE TROUBLE IS

EXPECTED IN KASENGA IN SOUTHEAST KATANGA WHERE THE GARRISON IS

ABUSING CIVILIANS. GENERAL NORBERT MUKE AND CHIEF OF STAFF MICHEL
