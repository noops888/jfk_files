In each case when you initiate any inquiry or investigation of a visiting

Soviet-bloc national, you should obtain from the local Domestic Contact

Service the nature and extent of CIA interest and all pertinent information

which CIA has gained or may acquire in the future relating to our internal

security responsibilities. If you feel that CIA activity conflicts with

Bureau objectives, you should so advise the Seat of Government, clearly

UBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CIA

Reference is made to my letter of 3/2/70. I made the

statement, "Unfortunately., CIA also belleres that in the past

we did not always act in a forthright manner, and the Agency

undoubtedly could present a list of grievances." It is my

understanding that you want such grievances identified.

There

1s enclosed herewith"a list of cases of situations which arose

over the years.

Based upon a review of files and my, personal recollectio=

this list would be representative of matters which CIA could use

for making charges such as: not being forthright, not playing

Ialrly and squarely, not cooperating, not being of assistance,

not recognizing the need for concrete FBI contributions to the

foreign intelligence effort.

What CIA may have compiled over the :

years is unknown.

What situations are known to CIA and have not

come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am

thinking of leaks including distorted information which may bave

been passed to CIA from ex-Bureau employees and CIA informants

and sources;

It should be clearly emphasized that there is no

indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking

any find of a showdown or controntation with the ril. contrary,

to what some people may believe,

the relationship between the

two agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite

the problems which have arisen from time to time. I am confident

that a thorough and impartial examination will conclusively

support the foregoing.

In order that there may not'be any misunderstanding, it

Is important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an

extensive list of justified grievances.

We can also produce an'

excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably

CIA could do the same.

There are ingredients for continuing

conflict and there is also adequate machinery for maintaining

sound working relations and producing badly needed intolligence

dnformation.

Interested Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment

on the attached material if me analyzed very briefly the role

of the Bureau liaison Agent. A liaison Agent can be a simple

mail courier or be can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confront

any problem of issue with another-gency, very often working with

very limited infornation. It is expected that the Bureau Agent

be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various

conditions.

He must be alert for pitfalls and express himself

In a most judicious and prudent manner but always making certain

that the Bureau position is well fortified.

In evaluating the attached and my encounters with CIA,

st should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were

easy to handle because the Agent had f. Edgar Hoover behind bin.

However, when an Agent struck at-an official on one day and

solicited his cooperation the next day, it did require some

resourceful action. It is believed that other liaison Agents

regularly encounter similar situations. On numerous occasions

INVOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE

• CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

(1) MOCASE. (THE BORIS MORROS CASE)

This was a sensitive Soviet-espionage case

which originated in 1943 and terminated for the most

part in 1957..

The case had many wide foreiga ramifi

cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly

11] be, one of the most important. and involved cases

of Soviet operations in this country and abroad. We

did not disseminate any iniormation of significance

In this case until 1954. On various occasions whea

the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu

ments with CIA officials, they have seen fit to raise

this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to

cooperate with the Agency.

The position taken by CIA

was that it should have been advised regarding the

Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,

claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity

to develop more infornation of significance, identify

Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for

recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. He did

not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the

!

extreme sensitivity of the case.

We actually did not

permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to

the HOCASE until 1957.

In 1957, CIA complained that it certainly had

every right to have received the information earlier

because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA

the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the

Hith regard to dealing with the french, we

took the position that we would cover the leads

through

our Legal Attaches wherever possible and to furnish

leads to CIA in those countries where we did not have

Legal Attaches. CIA maintained that since we were on

record that our Legal Attaches do not handle operations

abroad, the Bureau had an obligation to levy those French

leads on CIA or at least coordinate with the Agency

before going to the French.

It is to be noted that in any argument relating

to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA will fall back on the

responsibilities placed on the Agency under the provisions

of. the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation

of the foregoing through National Security Council Direc

tives. CIA will maintain that' it is incumbent upon the

Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security

Act of 1947 and the Directives. The Agency would argue

that in the BOCASE. these were

ignored by the Bureau.

(3) THE ABEI, CASE

Although CIA has not raised the point for

several years, the prevailing attitude was; and probably

still exists, that the FBI did not play it square with

CIA in the abel case by not making certain that the

Agency fas given the proper recognition for 1ts contri-

butions.

CIA feels 'that in the first place, there would

not have been any U. S. access or availability to the

source in this case,

because CIA took

the full responsibility for moving NAME from PLACE

to the U. S. in 1957. CIA claims it took the risk and

responsibility of doing this after the Bureau declined

to become involved in any operation designed to transport

NAME

to the.U. S.

It should be noted that NAME

was an alcoholic and that his first contacts with CIA

In PLACE raised questions concerning NAME

stability.

After NAME arrived in the U. S., we

arranged access to him for a period, the purpose of

which was to obtain a complete story of his intell1-

fence activities in the U.S. and we were particularly

Interested in identifying all of his associates, es

pecially the man who later was identified as Rudolph

Abel.

After a short handling period in the U. Sog-he

dropped NAME because he became a problem.

It was

an extremely critical situation because we had not yet

vas a most fortunate arrangement as far as CIA was con.

cerned, because this adjustment

gave us the time to work

led tö the apprehension of Abel. The Agency has main-

tained that it was largely responsible for making

absolutely certain that NAME

CIA has- also referred to

FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS

On occasions in the 1950's,

CIA complained that

given excellent treatment on the tour but, nevertheless,

mary. of the risitors left most disappointed because they

had not had any contact with any Bureau officials. CIA

felt that contact with Bureau officials had very significant

benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of

the FBI's worldwide reputation.

CIA also pointed out that

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,

they were left with the suspicion that there was some kind

of friction between the FBI and CIA.. In 1956, we had a

clear-cut policy to the effect that tours for

such visi

tors would be of a restrictive nature in that such

visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the

public and nothing more. CIA ras so laformed but

periodically indicated

that our policy prevented the

Agency from truly enhancing U. S. interests abroad.

CIA never lodged an official complaint.

It should beemphasized that for the past several

years there would not be any basis for any forma complaint

• 1given to such officiais by

¡other officials and Supervisors in the Domestic Intelligence

(12) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL -

In YEAR the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused

our Legal Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert

Intelligence activity "of a nature which I believe

exceeds his terms of reference."

The Ambassador further

Indicated that CIA was unhappy over the Legal Attache's

activities and the Agency allegedly had told the Ambassador

that the legal Attache had disseminated information from

& source who was a fabricator or a provocator..

This

situation arose as a result of the Legal Attaches

operation of an informant in Brazil. Some of the

Information that he received from the informant was

of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who

was being touted as a Presidential candidate. CIA

asked for the identity of the informant and we told

the Agency that the person could not be identified

because he did not wish that his identity be disclosed.

This case is being cited because CIA may have evidence

that we had been operational in Brazil, had not coordi

nated pursuant to Directives, and that the matter was

further aggravated because of the alleged unreliability

of the information.

Honorable Richard Helms.

Director

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Helms:*

As I am gure you will agree, the need for close

coordination of thefintelligence-gathering ans/counter-

Intelligence

efforts of the FBI and the Central Intelligence

Agency (CIA) is self-evident. This matter. is one which

requires a continuing analysis to assure that both agencies

have established working agreements whereby we can most

• effectively realize positive results with a minimum of

duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of the CIA to consider coordina

•tion of our. mutual efforts in the collection of positive

intelligence in the United States. Ag a result of these

conferences, a set of ground rules was drawn.up and agreed

to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted

In my letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director

Vice Admiral William F. Reborn, JI. A copy of the agreeirent

is enclosed for your information. ' This agreement has proven

generally effective and no major problems have been

encountered since

Its adoption in the areas it covers.

s. . The FBI has primary responsibility with regard to

matters involving the internal security of the United States

as well as for conducting counterintelligance operations in

this country. While this Bureau does not have any statutory

responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign

intelligence, I have always recognized that the potential

for the development of such intelligence in this country 1s

considerable.

The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort

to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.

=: Intelligence agencies, Including the CIA, and policy making

officials of the Government. While these efforts have,

of course, been incidental to our main Internal security

and counterintelligence responsibilities, we have on a

selective basis developed sources, both live and technical,

providing coverage at key foreign establishments in the

United States. The product of this coverage has been furnished

on a regular basis to the CIA and other interested agencies

and officials of the Guverimeni.

I know that you will share my bellef that this

matter requires a periodic reexamination to assure that the

national security interests continue.to be served in the

most effective and complete manner possible. After reviewing

this matter, Including the attached 1966 agreement, I Would

welcome any observationg you may desire to make.

Sincerely yours,

• *. Edgar Hoover
