Robert S. Anson, author of "They've Killed the
President! The Search for the Murderers of John F, Kennedy,"
offered a critical appraisal of Lee Harvey Oswald's travel
through Western Europe prior to his appearance in Moscow
on October 16, 1959. Anson expressed particular concern
over the issuance of a Soviet tourist visa in Helsinki,
Finland to Oswald prior to his entry into the Soviet Union.
Anson wrote that "/o 7n Monday, October 12, Oswald went
to the Soviet Consulate and applied for a visa. It was
granted two days later.” (Anson, p. eee concluded:

Oswald also managed to secure a Soviet
visa in record time. The CIA told the
Commission that under ordinary circum-
stances obtaining a visa in Finland

took one or two weeks; Oswald got his
in two days. (Ibid., p. 160)* ~—

* Anson was referring to the Warren Commission Report where it
is stated: oad

The Department. of State has advised the Commission
that it has some information that in 1959 it usually
took an American tourist in Helsinki 1 to 2 weeks to

\ obtain a visa, and that it has other information that
the normal waiting period during the past 5 years has
been a week or less. According to the Department's
information, the waiting period has always varied. fre-
quently and widely, with one confirmed instance in 1963
of a visa routinely issued in less than 24 hours. The
Central Intelligence Agency has indicated (continued)

Thus, the issue has arisen whether Oswald's receipt
of a Soviet visa prior to his entry into the Soviet Union
was an “odd happening" as Anson characterized it; circum-
stantial evidence tending to show that Oswald had received
special assistance in order to enter the Soviet Union.
During the course of its investigation the Warren Commission
shared Anson's concerns.: In a letter to the CIA dated May
25, 1964 J. Lee Rankin inqudéred about the apparent speed
with whitch Oswald's Soviét visa was issued:.. Rankin noted
that he had recently spoken with Abraham Chayes of the
State Department who Sorectaoaet the time Oswald received

an
his visa to enter Russia from the Soviet Embassy pt Helsinki,

-at least one week ordinarily transpired between the time

of a tourist's application for a visa and the issuance of

* (continued from previous page)
that visas during the 1964 tourist season were being granted
in about 5 to 7 days.

This information from the Department of State and the Central
Intelligence Agency thus suggests that Oswald's wait for a
visa may have been shorter than usual but not beyond the
range of possible variation. The prompt issuance of Oswald's
visa may have been merely the result of normal procedures,
due in part to the fact that the summer rush had ended.

It might also mean that Oswald was unusually urgent in his
demands that his visa be issued promptly. Oswald himself
told officials at the American Embassy in Moscow on October
31, when he appeared to renounce his citizenship, that he had
said nothing to the Soviets about defecting until he arrived
in Moscow. In any event, the Commission has found nothing

approximately one month prior to Oswald's appearance at’
the Soviet Embassy, the Committee has found that the available
evidence tends to support the conclusion that “Oswald's
tourist visa within two to four days after his appearance
at the Soviet Consulate, were somewhat suspect, does not
warrant the belief that Oswald's travel into the Soviet
Union was assisted by others, particularly the Soviets.
However, the possibility of assistance cannot be dismissed
due to Golub's probable connection with the KGB and the

confirm that Oswald's visa was handled in a manner similar

to that of the two American students who“had entered the
