1. The Government of Honduras (GO) recently obtained a US$12 willion Joan
from the Central sserican Bank of Econoxic Integration for the expansion
of the Azucarera del Sur sugar mili located in Choluteca, Boxduras. In
addition, the GOH bas purchased two sugar mills, one in Brazil and the

with che aid of foreign tecimicians. Also, another sugar mill is to be
built in the comtry at a cost of US$20 million; hovever, the Japanese
Mitsubishi enterprise vill be the wajor stockholder, while Bozduren private
‘businessmen will hold a minority-interest. This is part-of an expansion
and wcdernization program by the GOH with hopes of obtaining a larger
share of the world's sugar market.

2. The GO fs somewhat concerned vith the infiltration through Mexico and
Guatemala of Comenist agitators and guerrilla training personel. These
- guerrillas, mostly Cubans who remained in the country after they had
‘arrived allegedly to assist the GOH following Hurricane Fifi, ate causing
growing concern as a result of sever2] uprisings and invasion of private
Janis by peasants in several parts of the country. The Cubans, vho stayed
in the comery following Hurricare Fifi and others who bave arrived
‘elandestinely since that tine, reportedly are training leftist militants.
and syapathizers among the Horduran peasants. The agitators. and guerrilla
dnstructors are taxing advantage of growing unemploynenr and the overall 4 -

CONTROLLED DISSEM

Businessmen in Honduras have reported that the eccnomfe and political
situation in the country, currently inasad state of affairs, is bound
te become worse as a result of the indifference being exhibited by
President Osvaldo Lopez Arellano. On the economic side, the private
business sector is quite concerned about an expected government move
to nationalize. the fishing industry. . Some foreiza firms already are
pulling out of the country and moving to nearby countries like
Nicaragua and £1 Salvador. Oa the political side, President Lopez
has failed to name a permanent foreign minister since Novenber 1974,
vhen Cesar Batres occupied that post. Ricardo 4. Pineda is performing
those dutieson an interim basis.. The President also has undermined
Honduran youth by giving in to the demands of the leftist-controlled
labor unions. He gives businessmen the impression that he does not
now such about government; consequently, the sitcation in the country
has become very unstable.

Appesently, the regime in Honduras wants to emulate the current
Peruvian Government in failing to even consider elections at all.

In fact, the government, which is controlled by tse military, has
three pro-left ministers in the cabinet. They are Manuel Acosta
Bonilla, Secretary of State for Finance; Guatama Fonseca Zuniga,
Secretary of State for Labor and Social Security, and Manlio Martinez
Cantor, Executive Secretary, Planning Board. At one time, Acosta was
the private secretary of the Mexican leftist leaier Vicente Lombardo
Toledano, so he has been thoroughly indoctrinated along Marxist lines.

Maracto Hay Fosaa ia the present director of Agrarian Before fs Wm ehat
He is inefricient and lacks some of the necessary qualifications for that
position. In spite of hinsbeing.a.lavyer by-profession,.he is not astute,
is caly of everage intelligence, is far frou decisive, and frequently
yacillates when called upon to sake decisions. He is, hovever, extremely
anti-Cocmunist. His deputy director. is Roberto Oliva. He is no asset.
He hag.no.outgoing personality whatsoever, and in Lact, he is rether
innocuous. ‘Que thing that-can be said in his favor is that he is reparted
te be s goed engineer. _

‘The previoss Agrarian Refors director was Rigoberto Sandoval. He is an
ely capable layer, very sagacicus, intelligent and he displayed
great foresight in that position. His present and future course of life
is worth observing closely because a possibility does exist
be-a candidate-for an important political position in the not too distant
foture. To date Sandoval has not meiitioned which political position be
plans to seck. ‘Another reasen for observing him is that he is exceedingly

anti-US.

Jf Sandoval does decide to seek a political office, it would sost probably
be General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who would. sponsor hin.

Enrly in October 1972 a US isporter-exporter received 4 very plossant
letter frou Rigoberto Sandoval. By the tone of the letter one
Would judge that a close relationship hay existed between then for ose
time, “Sandoval stated that he was in Italy working for the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and that for the present
his stay: there-was: for.an indefinite period. .He enclosed a long list of
itens which -he requested the US icporter-exporter to send to hin icmediately:
4f at all possible. The list consisted costly of furniture, household i
, electrical appliances, etc. {

‘2. For over five years I have been in close contact with Hondurana of
different backgrounds and social position. Never before have 7 seen the
anti-American sentiment which is sweeping Honduras at the present time.
‘The feeling is not only evident among student end labor organizations,
but among sectors of what is considered to be the best informed and

educatéd individuals in the country. Most of them are convinced -

that the US has the influence to exert diplomatic pre: sures on El Sal- i
‘yedor in order to settle the pending border dispute, but has failed
to do #0. ‘They see the US Government as favoring El Salvador.

conversations with several government officials they emphatically
stated thet Honduras was not going to open the Pan American Highway to
Selvadoran traffic. This is the attitude of almost everybody that T
talked vith. This single issue has served to unite the country like
never before. There is a new feeling of patriotiem which wes lacking
before the conflict with El Salvador.

3. ‘The campaign against Salvadoran products has resulted in an incentive . {
for Honduran investors. I have had several inquiries from Honduran
businesenen who are interested in establishing production facilities for
consuzer articles vhich were normally imported from £1 Salvador.

These individuals are eager to invest end establish factories in order
to f111 the deowad for products which were imported from El Selvador. i

4. Honduras has been purchasing arms end ammunition frow Portuguese and }
Belgian sources. Sone of this erasment has arrived in the country, = |
According to a military informant wost of the armament has not been
delivered, but is expected in the country before the end of the yeer.

Selected Honduran army officers have attended special courses at on amy

the munber of candidates sent since early 1972 has not only. been increased
Dut also each has been ordered to specialize in any one ef the br. ches of

qhe army gives an outward appearance of being in gympathy with the present

In private conversations sone speak of him in a derogatory manner, espec~
dally yoong officers.

A man who coutinnes to wield a sreat deal of power in Wonduras is Ricerdo
Zuniga Augustinus, Minister of Government and Justices also leader of the
Nationalist Party. quniga's ability to continue wielding power is due to
bis being a very clever, ‘astute, wealthy man. He always knows exactly
thet he wants, and does not hesitate to utilize his personal character-
istics and his wealth in obtaining his objectives.

Zunigats present ambition for continued power has forced hia to feign
being a firm constitutioualist. That is, he is claiming loud and clear
that comitnents made between the government and political parties must
not only be respected but must also be adhered tos ‘Zuniga does not clain
this because he really believes this to be a noral obligation, or because
he is a fervent democrats The fundamental zeason is that he knows he is
the recognized leader of the Nationalist Party, 66 well as having becone

Therefore, he calculates that through these ‘vo parties he can protract

the power he has today.

today relations betsien General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano and Zuniga are not
