DCD Case 63307

2

The new military regime in Honduras currently is holding talks with

Venezuela and hopes to sign an ecoronie agreement in the very near

future.

Mith that samind, the Goverment of Honduras (GOH) recently

sent a high level concission to Venezuela headed 35 Captain Armando

Sen Martis, Secretary of Sante for Iconary and Comerce and by Altorney

Antonio Jose Cuello i mJid discussions wich high rancing Venezuelan

Coverient officials. Prior to the raiks, the GOH recently sold to

Venezuela 25 million linear feet of lumber at a total cost of US$S

#dilion. The COY bopes to reach an agreement by vhici Venezuela would

buy Honduran agricultural products for an unspecified nix of cash and

petroleu products.

In addition, Venezuela would support a new agri

cultural production plan to be implemented in the very near future by

Fernando Montes, Bonduran Secretary of State for Agriculture.

Despite reports that Chief Executive Colonel Juan Alberto Melçar Castro

bas unquestioned authority, Honduran willtary sources have indicated

• that Marlo Maldonado, Agrartan Reforz Chief; Lleutenant Colonel Mario

• Tonseca, Director of

che Military Academy, and Lieuzenant Colonel Juan

Ramon Holina Cisneros, Commander of the First Artillery Battalion are

the real "power behind the chrone."

These officers, who profess a

strong nationalist ideolog, are interested simply

in the general welfare

of the Honduran people, and they are maintalning a "vatchdog" attitude

to insure that no one, especially people in positions of power, uses

such positions for his oun personal venefit.

These officers are mezbers

of the fiational Defense Council (IDC), which also includes the commandere

of all major military units in the country.

Naldonado, Fonseca, and

Molina appear tó be the "first mong equals" in the 15 member NDC.

. Businessmen in Honduras have reported that the eccuonde and political

situacion in the country, currently inasad state of affairs, is bound

te become worse as a result of the indifference being exhibited by

Picaldent Oswaldo Lopez Arellano.

On the economic side,

the private

business sector is quite concerned about an expected goverument move

to nationalize. the fishing industry. Some foreign firms already are

pulling out of the country and moving to nearby suntries like

Nicaragua and El Salvador.

On

the political side, President Lopez

has failed to name a permanent foreign minister since November 1974,

when Cesar Batres occupied that post.

Ricardo A Pineda is performing

chose duties on an Interin basis. The President also has undermined

Honduran youth by giving in to the demands of che leftist-controlled

labor unions. He gives businessmen che impressin that he does not

know such about government; consequently, the siration in the country

has become very unstable.

Zi Appecently, che regime in Bonduras wants to emulate the current

Peruvian Government in failing to even consider elections at all.

In fact, the government, which is controlled by tie military, has

three pro left ministers in the cabinet.

They are Manuel Acosta

Bonilla, Secretary of State for Finance; Guatama Fonseca Zuniga,

Secretary of State for Labor and Social Security, and Manlio Martinez

Cantor, Executive Secretary, Planning Board. At sue time, Acosta was

the private secretary of che Mexican leftist leader Vicente Lombardo

Toledano, so he has been choroughly Indoctrinated along Marilat lines.

(this report was developed by an Aruy representative assigned to the

office of preparation. l

Horacio loya Posas is the present director of Agrarian Reform in Honduras.

He is Inetticient and lacks some of the becessary qualifications for that

position. In spite of hie being a lawyer by profession, he is not astate,

1s my of orege irtelligence, is far fron decisive, and fraguently

vacillates when called pon to make decisions. He 18, however, extremiy

anti Commist. His deputy director is Roberto Oliva. He is no asset.

He has no artgoing personality whatsoever, and in fact, he is ruther

Annochors -

One thing that can be said in his favor in that he is reported

to be a geed engineer.

•2o: The previous Agrarian Reform director vas Rigoberto Sandoval. He le an

extremely capable lawyer, very sagacicus, intelligent and he displayed

great foresight in that position.

His present and future course of life

fe worth observing closely because a possibility does exist that be may

be a candidate-for an important political position la the not too distant

future.

To date Sandoval has not mentioned which political poaltion he

Plane to seek. Another reason for observing him la that be is exceedingly

ant: 03.

S. If Sandoval does decide to seek a political office, it would mont probably

be Ceneral Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who would sponsor him.

Early in October 1972 US importer exporter received a very plensant

parsonil letter fron Rigoberto Sandoval.

By the tone of the letter one

would judge that a close relationship has existed between then for som

time Sandoval stated that he was in Italy working for the Food and Agri-

calture Organization of the United Nations (FAD), and that for the preient

his stay there was for an Indefinite period... He enclosed a long list of

itene which he requested the US asporter-expurter to send to his lovediately

11 at all possible.

The list consisted costly of furniture, household

furiahings, electrical appliances, etc.

Honduran. merchants, industrialists and some of the

people have been urging

he revival of the Central American Common Mazkot (CACH) • To all intente

and purposes it has been practically non-existent. Salvadorians and

Cuatemalans have also expressed the same rinsire.

..20

In-early October 1972, these urgings were taken into consideration by

• the

Secretaryship of Central American Econonie Integration (SIEC1) (Secretaria

Permanente de Integracion Economica Centro Americana). SIECA appointed a

president, and a board of directors was selected. Eduardo Ortes Colindres,

a llonduran lawyer was narco president.

Coural Semon of Nicaragua and

Ceneral. Osvaldo Lopez Arellano approved the appointment of Eduardo Ortes

Colindres so much that they offered to aid him in revitalizing the CACH.

The board is composed of members from Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaraguag

• Costa Rica and Honduras. They are authorized to represent their countries

in all matters pertaining to the CiC.

2, It is interesting to note that in spite of Honduras having informally re

tired from the CACH, not only is the president a Honduran,

but so is the

president. of the Central American dank of Economic Integration (BCLE),

with headquarters in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

The fact that General Samoza

of Nicaragua and General Lopez Arellano of Honduras have volunteered their

assistance to Eduardo Ortes Colindres has led most of the Central Americans

to believe that the CACH can once again be made active.

it would indeed be nost beneficial to the Central American countries

concerned.

Labor is better organized in the northern part of Honduras than anywhere

else in that country.. It has a headquarters in every city where adminis-

trative activities are conducted and where sectings of union lenders are

held. So far meetings have not taken place at work centers.

Transactions between Labor and the government are carried nut by labor

delegates Celio Gorzalez, through the Ministry of Labor, never directly.

Labor, as such, does not subscribe. to any one particular political party.

The Marxist theories do not appear to appeal to Labor Unions.

many ut their members do seen to be leaning towards the Liberal Party®

On the surface Labor Unions' actions in Honduras appear to be denagogic

at tines®

They make demands on the government, industry and businesses

in spite of their knowing that their demands may prove to be harmful to

the economy of their country.

It would be rather unfair to always hold

the Honduran Union Leaders responsible for this demagogise, because

frequently the union members thenselves are guilty of pressuring their

leaders to execute some specific demand, even though they hud already

been sarned of the possible haraful effects.

1. Presideat Oswaldo Lopez Arellano is interested in a secord tern.

This opin

Lon 1s pased on a growing consensus anong Congressmen, Forduran business

leaders and the cilitary that Lopez desires to renain in oifice for another

tera. Te thinking in these jorduran circles is that ie lack of disclairers

by Lopez is, in itself, a strong indication os his "eonsimuiseo" plans. Ap

prosizately ten czys ago Herman rascua, zarager of the lational Railroad,

headguartered in San Pedro Saia, Lad a Ciscussion With we President during

which Pascua passed the renari that he would like to renain with the railroad

as long as Lopez remained in office.. Lopez sade no specific rejoinder to

this but Pascua left the President's office with the dissinct ingression that

Lopez Nodid rua for reelection.

Lopez would probably be reelected with relative ease. me opposition Liberal

Party is civiced internally and lacks bors an elfective ce didate and the

capital necessary to offer a serious challerge.

,. The power and influence of Ricardo Zuniga has declined rastically in recent

sonths.

Inis is not due to any sicific act but more to a growing realization

by President Lopez of Zuniga's dishonesty, assision for zoner and his in

abilisy to get along with sose government oisicials and orcairent military

officers. President Lopez was particularly cistayed at Zuniga's hardling of

Honduran pronagarda during the recent Honduran/El Salvadoran border war.

Lopez allegedly felt that the irvective against El Salvador often mirrored

the type used by Cuban Cosmunist.

Miguel andonie Ferrandez, a seis appointed presidential candidate, is as

honesty sincere and well respected man. There is a suali group of roughly

ten Arab and Jcwish businesssen in San Pedro. Sula know as the "econosic

madia" because they control so such of Horduran business'activity, mis

group has taken rote of the candidacy of Femandez and bas been inpressed

by his honesty and sincerity.. They will not support his however, because

they feel he lacks the political experience and popular base for a successful

campaign.

.Jo For over five years I have been in close contact with Hondurana of

different backgrounda and social position.

Never before have i seen che

anti-American sentiment which is sweeping Honduras at the present time.

The feeling is not only evident among student and labor organizations,

,but among sectors of what is considered to be the best informed and

educated individuals in the country.

Most of them are convinced

that the US bas the Influence to exert diplomatie pressures on El Sal-

vador in order to settle the pending border dispute, but has failed

to do so. They see the US Government as favoring El Salvador.

During conversationa with several government officials they emphatically

stated that Honduras was not going to open

the Pan American Highway to

Salvadoran traffic.

This is the artitude of almost everybody that I

talked with. Thia single issue has served to unite the country like

never before.

There is a new feeling of pacriotian which was lacking

before the conflict wich el Salvador.

3. The campaign againse Salvadoran products bas resulted in an incentive

For Honduran investore.

I bave had several inquiries from Honduran

businessmen who are interested in establishing production facilities for

consuner articles which were normally imported from El Salvador.

These individuals are eager to invest and establish factories in order

to fill the demad for producte which were imported from El Salvador.

Honduras has been purchasing arms and armunition from Portuguese and

Belgina sources. Some of this armament has arrived in the country.

According to a military informent most of the armament has not been

delivered, but le expected in the country before the end of the year.

."Z. During early August 1969 a close business associate net with Colonel (fnu)

Coreccolii (phonetic) and members of the Honduran Army General Staff. Colonel

Coreccolli and members of the Staff were alarmed by the continuing reports of

arms and ammunition stockpiling by El Salvador.

These individuale were of the

opinion that the armament of the Honduran Arned Forces was inferior to that of

El Salvador.

During the meeting Colonel Coreccolli inquired about the possibility of a legal

• or illegal purchase of approxizately 2500 M-1 rifles and an undetermined amount

of .30 caliber ammunition fron US sources. He explained that the weapons were

needed to arm personnel with prior military service in case of a renewal of

hostilities with El Salvador.

These individuals were considered to be z re

-serve for the Honduran Armed Forces.

3. My associate explained to Colonel Coreccolli that under the circumstances the

US Government would not issue an export permit for the armaments.

for il=

. Legal sources my associate disclaimed knowledge of any. He also considered

the transportation problem.

Colonel Coreccolli stated that if acquired the

weapons could be smuggled aboard a Honduran refrigeration ship which was an

chored in the Miami River at that time. Following this Colonel Coreccolli

closed the meeting indicating that he was going to explore other possibilities.

Following the meeting my associate had a conversation with Rigoberto Sandoval

a member of the Planification Board. Upon being informed of the meeting, Sandoval

warned my associate to be careful in any dealings with Colonel Coreccolli, since

he was known as a corrupt government official, a "thief". Sandoval stated that :

thie was the opinion of President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who distrusted Corec-

colli.

A few days later my associate learned that Ricardo Zunisa, Minister of

the Presidency, has been given the task of purchasing arne and ammunition for

Honduras.

Hauricio Hernandez, wealthy oner of a lumber mill in Honduras, risited the is

during the firet. part of August 1969.

He told me that he was going to purchase:

tiro "combat aircraft" for the Honduran Government.

He did not specify the type

nor the source of the aircraft.

About a week later I had a telephone conver

sation with Hernandez, during which he told me that he had been

"guccesstul" in

-bis purchasing mission. He did rot give any detaile.

Their primary interest seems to be the construction and repair of roads

throughout the Republic. In conversation vith a liaison officer between

and the lack of cooperation by the Public Works Office. He told me that

In most instances the requeste made by the army for the use of additional

transportation or utilization of existing equiment are disregarded by

minor officiala. This creates problens requiring the action of higher

officials, who are given the impression that the army is the originator of

these problems.

Considering the available resources and facilities of the country the

arned forces are vell trained and disciplined. During the latter part of

1967 President Anastacio Somoza and & group of other Niceriguan dignitaries

waited Fonduras.

Several groups under Coomnist Influence desonstrated

against the visit. I had the opportunity to observe the developnent of

the deconstration, frou a meeting to a riot, from a vantage poiat.. Despite

the fact that the aruy riot control troops were stoned and abused they

vere disciplined enough to prevent wbat could have been a serious incident.

They did not attack or fire at the sob, as vould have been the desire of

the leaders, who Incidentally alvays reanined behind the nob and utilized

other people to direct ard incite the demonstrators.

The troops and juntor

officers who vere present during the deconstration were highly praised by

the responsible elements of the society.

zuniga's ability to continue wielding power is due to

his being a very clever, astute, wealtiny man.

He always knows exactly

what he ants, and does not hesitate to utilize his personal character-

istics and his wealth in obtaining his objectives.

Zuniga's present ambition for continued power has forced him to feign

being a firm constitutionalist.

That is, he is claiming loud and clear

that comitments made between the goverment and political parties must

not only be respected but must also be adhered to.

this because he really believes this to be a moral obligation, or because

he is a fervent democrat; The fundamental reason ie that he knows he is

the recognized leader of the Nationalist Party, as well as having become

influential in the Liberal Party. He believes these parties are the ones

sustaining the present regime of President Ramon Ernesto Cruz in power.

Therefore, he calculates that through these two parties he can protract

Foday relations betwen General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano and Zuniga are not

as cordial as they were previously. However, one must not be led to be

leve that this situation is unrepairable because if Zuniga needed Lopez

Arellano's help, or vice versa, the former pleasant r ationship would

be hastily nursed back to life.

Jo. My work takes me to the rural areas In Honduras where I have opportunity

-to talk with the peasants.

It is my considered opinion, based on per-

sondl obcervations, that the peasants in the rural areas are bitter and

disgusted with theis lot.: They have little or no faith left in anyone.

Economically,

thel condition in second onty to Haits, In conparison with

the countries in the Caribbean.

The prices of staples compare with

There is little econoade developent in the country end almost complete

Jack of initiative and vigor. Seldon is a run found in Government or

Industry who is not aflicted with the two major vices among this cecent

of the population: wine and vonen. The econonic Inactivity at tines

appears to be the result of indifference, other times the result of

Intentloal delays by Communist infiltrators in Governent. As an ex-

anple of this "lack of initiative" I Will enke reference to the road in

the Olancho ared.

The loan for this 110 Illopeters of road was approved

In October 1963. The road is badly needed to nove agricultural products

from t316 region, to provide employuent for hundreds of needy people,

and to provide the only access for the construction of & US$ 20 million

pulp and parer plant in the area.. Until the sunner of 1957, these funda

remined Idle. Preliatnary studies were not even mede. With luck, '

principal and interest are due to start.
