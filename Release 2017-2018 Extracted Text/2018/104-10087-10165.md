well beyond what has been released to the publ.

be borne in mind in making a decision on Mr. Belin's

question. To remove any question in anybody's mind about

our good faith in this matter, the narrative is backed up

by copies of actual documentation from our files. It

seems to me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or

his representative review the documentation that'backs up

the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into

the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi-

cal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest

developments in thg matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate fefategce to individual items. [NB: There
