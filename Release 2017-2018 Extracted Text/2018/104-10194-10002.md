MEMORANDUM FOR: éagsstatsmmenerses

THROUGH : Chief, CSB, Frankfurt

SUBJEC?P : Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization

Retirement and Disability System
REFERENCE : Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1965

1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Ketirement
and Disability System ‘and have been so designated effective 25 Beptember 1966,

2, Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons,
the regulation governing this retirement system gives the Individual the right to appeal such
fa determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this
technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of-your right to appeal» An-
appeal with reasons- therefore must be teceived in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of
this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may
have in eonncction with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced
Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.

4. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the
benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which
an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he
would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the policy
decision has been made ‘that a participant in the Organization System who would receive @
higher annuity under the Civit Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-
ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus,
you should not anticipate tlits contingency. as a factor In deelding whether you regard your
designation as a participant adverse to your best interests,

To ; Harold F. Swenson

SUBJECT: TDY in the Dominican Republic

Most of you who went down to the Dominican Republic
departed with so much speed.and so little ceremony that
there was no time to explain the importance and urgency
of your assignments. Now that you have served there
during the crisis, the importance of the task needs no
embellishment from us, but you should know that the con=
tribution of the augmented Station was decisive in shaping
the policies and actions of the government and in avoiding
several major mistakes, For weeks after the April revolu-
tion, our Station reporting was literally the only source
of information that the United States had on the role of
Communism among the rebel forces and on conditions outside ©

the capital,
_Many fine things were done in the Station and in the
hinterland by all of you. Manning the check~points under

fire, flying to remote and hostile villages, moving tons
of supplies through the gauntlet of the communications

‘line, toiling over midnight reports, and keeping open our

country's only commo link ~= all these things were common-
Place. The dedication, discipline, and routine of our
personnel placed them in a class apart.

To the sense of pride and accomplishment you must
already feel, I want to add the gratitude and admiration

of the DDP and of the Agency.

until the last few days of the period coverg, in the rating, Mr.
Swenson performed the duties of CI-Staff Chief for’ WH7@uba. © This
Staff has since been combined with another branch and part of its
functions transferred to JMWAVE-as part of a plan worked out by Mr.
Swenson and Chicf, JMWAVE, This ‘consolidation program has resulted
in a significant saving in manpower without loss of operational
efficiency. Mr. Swenson's performance in his new duties as ‘Special
Assistant to the Deputy Chief, WH for Cuba, for planning has just
begun and it is not possible to rate him on these, Mr, Swenson's
performance ‘as Supervisor of the CI Staff continued to be marked by
high ability and aggressiveness throughout the period, He is an
effective leader who obtains good work from his personnel. His unit
was marked by'a high morale and good organization, During this period
Mr, Swenson has personally directed and participated in the remotiva-
tion of a previously disappointing CI asset who was also trained and
dispatched into Cuba, This agent began communicating shortly after
his return to Cuba {ndicating the success of the operation, Mr.
Swenson has also been personally responsible for a variety of other
operational activities including the preparation of a "white book"
concernitig Cuban intelligence and subversive activities in Latin
America which is being made available to various governments. Mr.
Swenson carricd out a number of briefings of high level foreign
officials concerning these matters in a highly effective manner,

During much of the reporting period, Nr, Swenson has ‘been on
TDY overseas attempting to recruit members of the Cubans ‘Intelligence
Service, In these cndeavors he has had noteworthy success. Also
during this period Mr, Swenson and his staff developed the first
comprehensive picture of the Cuban intelligence structure and
Sreanizational details, These results were due to Mr. Swenson’s
drive, experience, and ability. As stated in my previous report
on Mr. Swenson, "he is impatient with colleagues and collaborators
Qhom he feels do not measure up to his own high standards." This
Gontinues to lead to personal friction and detracts from his many .
capabilities, I bolieve he is best suited as a senior high-level
operations officer or tho chief of a small active station rather

than as a staff officer.

He handles funds and manpower prudently.
