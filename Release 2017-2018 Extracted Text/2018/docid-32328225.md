PROSECUTIVE POSSIBILITIES

As previously reported FRANK J. KIERNAN, Special
Attorney, Department of Justice, advised that the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) had obtained information that TRISCARO
received income during 1960 which the IRS believed would not
be reported by TRISCARO on his 1960 Income Tax Return.
Mr. KIERNAN had expressed the view that in view of the IRS
investigation it might be adviseable to hold in abeyance any
investigation into the financial affairs of TRISCARO until
IRS had definitely resolved its potential case.

As reported, Mr. KIERNAN advised on May 16, 1961,
that he had been informed by ELDON MYERS, Chief, Intelligence
Unit, Cleveland, that the Income Tax Return of TRISCARO had
not been located, indicating that TRISCARO may have been
permitted to file a delayed return or that the return had
been filed but not yet processed, At that time Mr. KIERNAN
expressed the view he did not feel that the matter should be
held in abeyance indefinitely and that if the IRS matter is
not resolved in the near future any additional investigation
which might uncover violations of Federal law on the part of
TRISCARO should be pursued.

Mr. KIERNAN advised on June 26, 1961, that as yet
IRS had not located the 1960 Income Tax Return of TRISCARO

and due to this, it had not been established whether or not
TRISCARO had failed to declare certain income received dur-
ing the fiscal year 1960, Mr, KIERNAN suggested that inves-
tigation by the FBI of any potentially productive leads

should be pursued as the status of the IRS is still indefinite.

On July 14, 1961, Mr. KIERNAN stated that the IRS
investigation of TRISCARO concerned principally certain checks
on which TRISCARO's endorsement appears. One of these is a
$10,000 check dated August 21, 1959, drawn on the ac@ount of
Servicios Internacionales, S. A., D. BARTONE, President, at
