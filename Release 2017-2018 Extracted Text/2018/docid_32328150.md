had decided to sell their rights to this concession. He stated it

appeared this decision was brought about by the edict of the Nevada

State Gambling Board requiring a separation of

LANSKY advised that

while the combination would have to sell their concession rights in

a poor market, nonetheless they had

made a substantial profit on

their initial

investment in the casino during the first two years of

operation and they would not suffer any loss.

LANSKY stated he was certain the selling agreement would

have to be acceptable to the Hotel Nacional; in that the caliber and

reputation of the individuals buying the concession will have to meet

with the hotel's approval. JACK LANSKY stated the question of whether

or not he would remain in. Cuba and operate the casino would depend upon

the identity of the individuals who bought the concession.

LANSKY stated the combination had yet not opened the

Stardust, a new gambling casino in Las Vegas which had been built by

them because of difficulty in obtaining a license for the Stardust

until such time as they have sold their interests in Cuba.

LANSKY stated the edict of the Nevada State Gambling Board

requiring a separation of interests was strictly a political maneuver

directed in the main at CLIFF JONES, former..

Lieutenant Governor of

Nevada, and that while the decision

would, of course, affect JONES,

who has just recently invested a substantial.

amount of money in the

Hotel Havana-Hilton, it was also affecting other individuals with

to do with Nevada state

politics. He stated that JONES, prior to buying an interest in the

gambling casino in the Havana-Hilton, had discussed the matter with the

Governor of Nevada to insure there would be no difficulty and had been

assured he would have no problem. LANSKY stated that subsequently,

however, JONES, a Democrat, had thrown his support behind other

Democrats in the forthcoming Nevada elections in November and as a

result, the present incumbent, a Republican, had sent the word down

to the Nevada State Gambling Board to "put the squeeze", on JONES.

the Hotel Nacional, advised that TOM McGINTY was in Havana for the

purpose of discussing the problems that had arisén in connection with

ownership of the casino because of the recent edict of the Nevada state

Gaming Board. Mr. Kelley indicated that MC GINTY had said that SAM

TUCKER would

SAMUEL LAWRENCE, BRATT, a former associate of theSLANSKYS in gambling

operations in. Broward County.

On June 13, 1958, PCI Arthur Newman mentioned

that he

believed the present

interest holders in the Nacional casino would

be given plenty of time by the Nevada Gaming Board to effect the

sale of their interests.

Source said he did not believe JACK LANSKY

would leave the casino unless there was a very radical change in

ownership.

Source believed there would not be any actual change in

ownership but just a change in faces in Havana.

On June 18, 1958, Thomas Kelley, mentioned above, advised

that SAM TUCKER had received permission from the Nevada State Gaming

Board to take whatever time was necessary to dispose of the interest

he had in the casino at the Hotel Nacional. Kelley was of the opinion

that TUCKER might attempt to delay taking action on selling his

interest in the casino until the November elections in Nevada in

order to see whether the present incumbents might lose out thereby

resolving his problem.

ORIENTAL PARK RACE TRACK Havaru, Luba

Information was previously furnished Legat, Havana, that

an individual known as "JOCKEY" DENNIS, a former con man

a had purchased

an interest in the gambling casino at the Jockey Club at

the Oriental

Park Race Track.

On May. 29, 1958, HAV-31 advised that this individual

had died on that date of pleurisy.

On June 16, 1958, PCI Pedro P. Tapia (conceal) verified

the fact

that "JOCKEY" DENNIS had died.

This source stated that

~GEORGE LEVINE, FBI No. 382915, continues to operate the Oriental

Park Race Track as well as

casinos at the track.

Source said

thät the track is losing about $5,000 a week but that LEVINE appears

to have unlimited resources. Source noted that the profit at the

casinos is not sufficient to offset the losses at the track.

GENERAL INFORMATION

Sources have advised that there has been a recent improve-

ment in tourism in Havana with the resultant slight increase in

activity in the casinos. At present, only two casinos are reported

to be breaking even or better.

These

are the casinos at the Hotel

Capri and the Havana-Hilton.

Sources feel, however, if the political

situation remains reasonably quiet that all the casinos will

eventually be showing a profit.

Kelley said this

hotel is to be constructed in the near future and will have a gambling

casino. He stated it will ostensibly be financed by Compania Cubana

de Aviacion and that President Fulgencio Batista willhhave an interest

in the operation.

Mr. Kelley said that LIPSKY and SCHWARTZ indicated

they will operate the gambling casino and that Senator KENNETH JOHNSON

of Nevada will have an interest in the casino operation. Mr. Kelley..

said that while he had not previously known LIPSKY, he recalled having

met SCHWARTZ on several occasions many years ago in New York City.

Kelley said at that time SCHWARTZ was considered to be a "right-hand

man" for FRANK COSTELLO.

Isla de Pinos (Isle of Pines); Cuba.

This advertisement indicated

that a large hotel-motel and gambling casino would be constructed on

the Isle of Pines.

On June 5, 1958, JACK LANSKY advised that the

publicity about a new hotel and gambling casino to be constructed

on the Isle of Pines was simply a land-selling promotion on the part

of the Mayor of Havana, JUSTO LUIS POZO, who has substantial property

interest there. LANSKY stated that tourism is and has always been
