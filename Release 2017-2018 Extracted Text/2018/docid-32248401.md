neither by civilian nor military personnel, concerning IHO or.

any of his associates or any investigation concerning the assas-

sination of President Kennedy•

flight nor does he recall issuing any such order. He believes

very strongly that if any such flight or order had come to his

attention he would have remembered it.

During our conversation

the General excused himself and

went to his

basement and then returned with a flight log book.

After fingering through his book he stated that he did have a

personnel plane assigned to him. He described the plane as

being a V-5-54-P model airplane Service #90392. He also

stated that when this plane was not being used by him it was

not unusual for the plane to be used to fly other missions,

without his knowledge. He repeated that he had no knowledge

of any flights to Japan concerning LHo nor did he sign any orders

directing any such flight. The General did state that it was

very possible that orders could have come down from Naval head-

quarters in Washington, ordering such a flight and he might not

know anything about it.

When asked about the official log book for this plane,

in an effort to verify all flights by this plane, the General

indicated that the official flight logs for any military air

craft remain with the plane. When theplane was permanently

deactivated, it is his belief that the log book and the offi-

cial records concerning the plane would have been sent to either

Marine Operations or to the Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington,

D:C. He also stated that he did not know if the plane was

still active or not.

A: Roberts Interview

In reviewing the General's flight log book, it was

noted that the General had no flights between June 1963

and January 1964. The General further disclosed that he only

kept flight log records of flights he went on.

During the conversation, General Roberts indicated that

he had in his basement about twelve flight log books he had

kept over the years.

General Carson A. Roberts was very cooperative and in-

dicated that he was willing to assist this Committee in any

way he could. ' If it became necessary for him to be subpoenaed

to Washington he would appear.
