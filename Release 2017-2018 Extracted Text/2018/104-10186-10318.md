Headquarters Comment.

The following Information, as

reported

by source during a debrifing, reveals the misuse of official

documentation and procedures by tho General Directorate of

Intelligence: (Direccion Goneral do Inteligencia - DGI).

Use of Altored and Fraudulent Documents by Cuban Intelligence

1. Cubans and other Latin American nationals operating for the General

Directorato of Intelligence (Direccion General de Intoligencia

DGI) of the Cuban Ministry of Intorlor are issued Cuban passports

in allas by

tho Cuban Foreign Ministry.

These passports are.

considered legal in all respects by Cuban authoritles.

agents also use valid passports of a number of Latin American

countries in which false entries are provided by Cuban intelligence

The docunents used by non-Cubans operating undor

IS auspices are intended to bide all traces of their travel into

and out of Cuba.

Cuban Diplomatic Passports

2.

Cuban diplomatic passports are issued in alias to IS staff per-

sonnel, consisting exclusively of Cuban nationals.

never issued in aliens operating as agents of Is.

There are

over 300 staff employees,

according to Source, all of whom are

oligible to receive Cuban diplomatic passports in allas.

Istilo over 100 staff employees are estimated by Source to have

boon documented in this way.

digit serial numbers.

theory was based on the fact

that his ordinary passport issued in altas bore a five-digit

number while the bond-fice passport issued to his wifo bore

a'six-digit number.

This premise is in direct contradiction

with a study of the numbering system found to be in use on

Cuban ordinary passports.

A pattern in numbering is found,

with occasional discrepancies, in which a new set of acces-

Shon numberg is used each year.

Thus, serial numbers will

Bona-fide Visas, Vaccination Certificates, and Passages

11.

Diplomatic visas for use in Cuban diplomatic passports in allas

are applied for directly by the Cuban Foreign Ministry

forcign mission concerned in Havana.

In Source's case appli

cation was first nade in March 1964 for a Chilcan visa and

later for a Mexican visa, even though no travci to Chilo was

contemplated.

The reason for this was awareness by Cuban

authorities of scxican suspicion of Cuban diplomale personnel.

The Cuban authoritics believed the Mexican Embassy in Havana

would be less suspicious of a passport containing a visa from

another Latin Amorican country.

12.

13.

Passage bookings and international vaccination certificatcs

for use by staff employces and agents using Cuban allas pass-

ports are also obtained through the Cuban Foreign Ministry.

Vaccinatlon certificates are obtained from the Instituto

Cubano de Amistad con 10s Pueblos (ICAP).

IS personiel's

passages are always booked on Cubana Airlines because such

fares are payabic in Cuban pesos.

No passages are booked on

possible, the pages of the passports bearing this entry with

blank pages from valid passports from the

Source also believes that

in 1961 the travel

pattern of a few prospeceive agents procceding to Cuba

may have

been modified, thus decreasing slightly the number entering

through lexico.

To conceal the agent's travel when leaving Cuba, he is providd

for the first log of the journey with a Cuban ordinary passport

in alias.

The route of travel is from lavana to Prague.

Croch

authorities collect these passports upon

landing in Prague.

Source does not snow what disposition is made of the Cuban

passports by the Crochs, but he asserts that they are never

returned to the agent.
