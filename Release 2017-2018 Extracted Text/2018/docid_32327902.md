tion indicated SANDOMINGO was SCALIA's mistress, and, although

• shot

during an

argument. HAV-32 informed that considerable political influence

had been exerted to obtain SCALIA's immediate release and that

he was set free under $25,000 bond. Source said that SCALIA

was placed under the protection of Lt. Colonel IRENALDO GARCIA

XBAEZ, the Head of the Cuban Army Military Intelligence Service ChE/

and son of Chief of Police PILAR GARCIA GARCIA. Hav-32/ informed-

that representatives of GARCIA BAEZ had "gotten to" MARTA SANDO-

MINGO MACHADO and that she claimed to have shot herself. Source

said that the superintendent in charge of the apartment building

where SANDOMINGO had been shot had been threatened by representa-

tives of GARCIA BAEZ to "keep his mouth shut." Source stated

for the Cuban newspaper "El Crisol"

written an article inti-

mating that SCALIA was linked with

the Mafia.

judicial authorities, there was no doubt that it would mysteriously

disappear in the immediate future. Source noted that for that

reason he had managed to clandestinely obtain the revolver and

had arranged to have two test shots fired from the weapon.
