EVENTS LEADING TO RECRUITMENT

first came to the official atten-
tion oF the Office of Security (0S) on 9 September 1955,
when (Executive Officer. 0S) forwarded a
lett Written by to (Chief, Personnel
Security Division, 0S), who in turn directed the letter
to James W. McCord [Security Research Staff of the Office
of Security (SRS)]. How obtained the letter
is unknown, inasmuch as the name of the addrésseéé was

deleted in the letter. However, the letter was rec
in the Executive Registry under tves| of The
letter is dated 27 April 1955, gives address an
telephone number, and advised that he was working
on an index of the Dai vr for the years 1953-1945

“and thought that perhaps you might be interested in
specific information that I am likely to find."

On 10° September 1955, James W. McCord contacted
in Flushing, New York. At that time, explained the
nature or rne index of the Daily Worker foe pelea Ata:
1945, by stating that he was preparing the index under a
grant from the American Legion Americanism Committee,

h ’ Lee Pennington (a forner employee of the FBI).

started the index in November 1954, stated

he contacted the major government agencies in Washington

to ascertain what information in the Daily Worker would

“be of most interest to them, and in addition, contacted
a couple of Congressional Committees which McCord surmised

were the House Committee on Un-Ameri tivities and the
Senate Internal Security Committee. estimated it

would take = ac a half years to complete the index. At

that time, was receiving part-time clerical assis-
tance from the Women's Auxili the American Legion
Post in Flushing, New York. (Pe fatse indicated an in-
terest in Agency employment after finishing the index.

The results of McCord's interview with were
brought to the attention of Robert Bannerman, Deputy Direc-
tor of Security, by 21 November 1955, when Bannerman opined
that "this may be valuable."

McCord met next with in Washington, D. C., for
two days, ending on 1 December 1955. By that time,
had indexed 150,000 names of the Daily Worker covering

January 1954 through June 1936. stated that the
FBI in New York City and the American egion_were already
making "extensive use" of the index cards. stated

that one of his purposes being in Washington was to secure
financing for the index cor nuation. He stated that his
$5000 a year grant from the American Legion Americanism
Committee would expire at the end of December 1955, and

if negotiations with that body were unsuccessful, he would
attempt to secure financing from the Senate and House Inves-
tigating Committees. stated that the FBI has indi-
cated the strongest desire that he continue the indexing
but that in his discussion with Mr. DeLoach (Cartha DeLoach,
an FBI senior official), no indication of forthcoming finan-
cial support from the Bureau for this work was indicated.

In recording this contact with McCord opined:

“YT think it is obvious that the index
which is working on would be of con-
_ siderable value io the ty Ottice and
@ to CIA, particularly since the Communist
Party membership and activities during the
1934-40 period were for the most part very
open and extensively advertised in the Daily
Worker. An example of how open their activi-
ties were is indicated in the fact that
Elizabeth Bentley's name was. mentioned in
a 1935 issue of the Daily Worker at a time
rior to her going underground and acquiring
a RIS (Russian Intelligence Service) mission.
Jf the Daily Worker thus bears a record of
(Communist) Party activities of an indi-
vidual such as Bentley, who later became
so prominent in RIS activities in the
United States, then the possibility always
exists that the names of persons later con-
nected with OSS (Office of Strategic Services)
and other governmental activity may also be
mentioned in the 1934-40 Daily Worker issues,
which have heretofcre never been indexed by
any government agency.

: "Because of the obvious value of

: having access to such an index, the writer
(McCord) recommends that we encourage the |
continuation of index project in
any way in which We are able to further
such work,"

(There is no objective evidence in the file other than
the above to suoport [-]eontention that he was given
encouragement by Mr. DeLoach of the FBI to continue the pro-
ject.)

The above was brought to the attention of
(Chief, Counterintelligence Branch, SRS), who
in turn brought the matter to the attention of Colonel
Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security, circa early
December 1955.

Via_a memorandum dated 19 December 1955, McCord
informed of the receipt of additional correspon-
dence from and McCord included a rehash of the
metter including statements:

can encourage the continuation of the
project, at least until the index is
completed up through 1940, which would
take about another year of work by
The index has considerable potential CE
(counter espionage) value to this Office,
for one thing, by virtue of the fact that
there will be numerous heretofore unidenti-
fied Communists' names turn up in the
index, some of whom went underground
during the World War Il years. The

index may give us the one clue neces~

sary to detect any such penetration
existing within this Agency. The value

in protecting the Agency thereby is of
course inestimable. The continuation

of the project would have other merits,
which we have discussed previously."

McCord recommended tha

tance with a number of the well-known ex-Communist Party
key functionaries, such as Louis Budenz, as well as a
personal acquaintance with tt eads and research people
in all of the Federal Congressional Committees, and State
Investigating Committees in New York State.

McCord was next in contact with on 27 December
1955, receiving an account of pertinent points retrieved
by from the indexing project. In addition,
“stated he had discussed the indexing project with
(an ex-FBI penetration of the CPUSA), who had a
continuing interest in the project and had indicated he
would be wiliing to help get a job in the newspaper
field should the project be terminated. also com-
mented that he had had lengthy political discussions with
(one-time Communist) in recent years, and
was in contact with a few weeks before.

Speculation on identity of Private Individual

When McCord's 27 December contact with was
brought to the attention of Bannerman, he directed
to "Explore with Jim Angleton (CI Staff) the po
getting about two months' expenses for subject
in the meantime we can complete our clearance of him and
try to make out a project. We should also make a survey

of his work to be certain a project is justified."

in turn, directed McCord to talk to (CI Staff)
about the matter.

In the interim, on 21 December 1955, completed
a Personal History Stat t (and a report of medical his-
tory) reflecting he had en employed since November 1954

As a result, McCord scheduled National Agency Checks in

On 17 January 1956, McCord informed receiving
his OK, that intended to place an article in the
monthly newsle "Political Research" published by an

organization affiliated with the NTS (anti-Soviet Russian
emigree organization). The article was to announce
indexing project and solicit funds.

4 27 January 1956, McCord informed
(Chief, SRS), Bannerman and Colonel Edwards of the
Tesults of a meeting he had that day discussing

indexing project with and fect

of the project should = forthcoming, and evidenced
interest in for after completion

of the project. Both Bannerman and Colonel Edwards evi-
: denced interest in Agency funding of the project, the latter
o asking for figures as to cost.

= ’ McCord was next in direct contact with in Flushing,
New York, on 29 January 1956, obtaining highlights of security
interest developed from the indexing.

By 6 February 1956, figures were produced showing that
$13,500 would cover one year continuation of the indexing,
$7,000 for $3,000 for a clerk typist; and $3,000 for
part-time help and supplies. On this date, Gaynor noted he
‘would like to see this project completed if at all possible."

By the first week of March 1956, "front office" verbal
approval had been given for OS funding of the project, labeled
Operation Recall, concurrent with a meeting between McCord
and and arrangements were made for transporting the
completed portion of the index to Washington, D. C. McCord
estimated the value of the index at that time as being be-
tween $15,000 to $25,000 in labor alone. During this week,
favorable National Agency Name Checks were concluded on
and Colonel Edwards and Colonel White had approved using
Security Office funds to total $10,000 in all, to continue
Wiley's indexing for one additional year. The partially
completed index was turned over to the Agency on 8 March 1956.

It was made clear to that CIA‘was pur-

chasing the end product of his work and that he was not

now a CIA employee. However, McCord did advise that
he would attempt to secure Agency employment for him at the

conclusion of the project; and that in the coming year

should work on the indexing, continue regular contact with
his sources of information in New York City - keeping the
Agency advised of anything that may be pertinent to our
areas of interest, and finally, build a cover story which
would enable to contact and interview various ex-
Communists and ex-Soviet agents in the New York area.

_ On 21 June 1957, Chief! SRS, re-
quested the Director of Security for authorization to con-
tinue the Daily Worker indexing project for one year which
had yielded approximately 590,000 names in the index. On

requested and received, such authorization for circa
$10,000 from the Deputy Director of Support.

@ : CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP - July 1959

On 1 July 1959, this Agency entered into contract
with as an independent contractor, at the salary
rate of $9,100 per annum, with additional compensation
in the amount of 5% of the above sum, to be paid in
quarterly installments, representing the Government's
contribution toward Wiley's choice of programs for insur-
ance, retirement, medical and health. The contract speci-
fied that he would be reimbursed for operational travel
as directed by OS, and for other approved operational
expenses, subject to accounting applicable with Govern-
ment regulations.

The annual compensation was subsequently increased
on 1 July 1960 to $9,900 per annum and on 1 July 1961 to
$10,500 per annum, plus additional 5% as noted above.
Salary has remained at the latter level to the date of
his termination. The contract was to run for an inde-
finite neriod, and could be terminated without notice in

several years after the Contract was signed, officers of
SRS continued to pay his salary either in cash or

through bank money ord@rs. In 1964 payments of salary
were made by the Office of Finance directly into his bank
account in New York City.

From 1959 to the present time, SRS obtained a copy
of each year's Federal Income Tax Return, and on at least

two occasions, was given a personal briefing on the
management of the Agency funds, vis-a-vis income from his
self-established firm, , by Agency
Finance Officers. In ecause of his failure to

comply with the SRS's instructions to furnish complete
details on his claimed expenses, the regular payment of
"operational" expenses was terminated, necessitating that
he reduce expenses which were not reimburseable from the
firm's income.

CUBA TRIP, ARREST AND DETENTION, 1960

Veuniis (hue!

(There is no conclusive evidence such as formal memo-
randa in the file to indicate that this Agency initiated
action to send to Cuba, However, inferences from
routing slips, Wémoranda and expense voucher Payments would
indicate that this trip was for CIA, Contrary to inferences
by SRS officers, there is indication, again such as a
formal memorandum, in the files that he, under CIA
instruction, courted arres detention so that he could
find out information about the three staff employees tho
were imprisoned there, This does not Preclude that there
might not be written notes of such a plan huried in other
files. The best indicator is comment on a
routing slip to CIA Cover Employee dated 2 February 1970,
"His (Wiley's) imprisonment in Cuba Was an operation on
behalf of FE-TSD-OS-DCI-DDP.1)

@ : stated that the actual arrest came about in the
* following way. He stated that he had talked with a young
man from the United States. The young Cuban whoiwas obvi-

ously violently pro-Castro and also had talked with a young
man from the United States. The young Cuban had been telling
that everything was fine in Cuba and that it was not
a police state and he was conducting his discussion with
this young Cuban in more or less routine reported style
when all of a sudden a poli fficer with two others moved
to the table where he was 5s g and stated that they wanted
to talk to outside, asked the ranking officer
who he was and was told that he was the Chief of the Public
Relations of the Youth Congress. However, after some argu-

repay the $1,000 advance for the China trip, but keep it
until he is assured of complete outside financing for the
Algiers trip. He would, as in the past, utilize this
fund to cover any deficit for his own travel costs; not

His most important contact is with Manuel Artime, one
of the leaders of the Cuban invasion force, who has just
been released by Castro. further noted

The plan, as follows, was presented in an undated mano7

"During the week of February and on 7 and

8 March

1963, extensive discussions were held with

concerning matters which are set out in de-

Chief/SRS and representatives of SRS that the pro-
posed plan which follows is the most sound, logical,
and secure method of obtaining the desired results:

NQBJECT - To place a skilled and controlled

D. C., which will have normal, routine, and ready

income adequate to be in Washington (ostensibly
@ from his own efforts); he must have a valid rea-
: son for being in Washington; he must have high
d capacity to produce; he must-have a strong secu-
rity sense; and he must have unquestioned loyalty.

"PROPOSED SOLUTI

"a. SOURCE - Source to be used is
fits in nearly every particular to the elements set
out in the 'Problem" above.

"b. METHOD OF SOLUTION:

"1, Source will begin at once to write
articles of importance, aiming at the placing
of these articles in national magazines, partie-
ularly magazines of the type of Life, Look,
Readers Digest, McCalls, Argosy, etc. Source

has numerous valid ideas for these articles and

already some interest has been shown

writings by Editors of the aforementioned type

magazines. Source will slowly divorce himself

from his numerous activities in New York City,
akoe

ma ing only strong anterest in his Cuben
: connections. Sovrce will need approximately
three months to write these articles and to sell

them, It is Source's intention that these articles
carry his by-line, which is a basic element to
building prestige necessary for Source's future
activity. Source is convinced he can handle this
successfully.

"Note: Heretofore Source has, under instruction,
kept the use of his name to an absolute minimum for
obvious reasons. This requirement will now be
lifted.

"2, At the same time Source will prepare
brochures for a lecture tour to be given by
Source during the Fall and early Winter, basically
on Cuba and Latin America. Already Source has
drafted brochures and he will have professional
guidance in this matter.

aa ‘Note: Source is an excellent lecturer. He
hi ppeared before public forums many times and

has a high capacity in this area. This
lecture tour, details of which will be set
out below, is considered of key importance
to the basic problem.

"3, Starting on or about the first of
July, Source will make an extensive tour of
Central and South America as a free lance re-
porter/writer/photographer, using his credentials
from the World News Analysis. Entree basically
will be provided using numerous Cuban contacts
Source has obtained throughout Latin and South
American countries. This trip will take probably
the most of July, August, and part of September
and is regarded as essential for back up, for
prestige, for area knowledge, and for lecture
material.

"Note: , Source is known to have excellent
Cuban antitCastro connections which will be sharpened
for use on this tour. (Source has been in every
area of the world except Latin and South America.)

and prepare for the aforementioned lecture tour.
© (It should be noted that there is no lecture

activity during the Summer months.) After pre-
paration, Source will proceed to make a lecture

tour covering all parts of the United States and
addressing all types of audiences. Source's

lecture tour will be run through the sponsorship of
the Babcock Agency of Virginia Beach, Virginia. This
Agency, which handles among others the important
members of the National Review Staff, will be
handled on a direct commission basis taking a usual
ten percent fee. In addition, through other organi-
zations Source will.arrange lectures on his own which
is routine and which will not conflict in any way
with the Babcock Agency interest. Source antici-

New York City.

Source (spreadhis name before the public),
@ and it will give him the necessary oppor-

tunity to conduct the following business:

As Source makes his lecture tour he will
attempt, by direct contact and through al-
ready established channels, to determine
whether or not he can set up for the basic
plan (a) a daily column, (b) a newsletter,

(c) a radio spot news broadcast. The lecture
tour, of course, will place Source in given
areas and it would be completely logical for
him to talk to local editors and radio station
owners and managers while in the area. He will
be backed up by the fact that he is lecturing
and that he is a writer because of the pre-
viously mentioned articles.

"d. Upon his return to New York City on or about
the first of the year 1964, Source will then be
able to make a definitive statement as to whether
or not he can conduct on a continuing basis and
on an economically sound basis (a) a daily column;
(b) a weekly newsletter; or (c) a radio newscast
enna

"Note: Source has evolved an idea of making
@ short newscasts which he believes can be peddled
is on a spot basis to various local radio chains,
perhaps weekly. This idea, which is novel, ap-
pears to have a great deal of merit.

"e. After Source and SRS staff have had a chance
to analyze the total result, a decision will then
be reached as to the feasibility of moving Source
to Washington. If the results of the above set
out plans indicate that Source can logically appear
in Washington, he will then, for a period of about
30 to 60 days while operating either his column,
newsletter or radio broadcast bureau, shuttle back
and forth between New York and Washington obviously
seeking news. He will let it be known to his friends
in the newspaper and writing business that the pres-
sure of his work is such that he will need some
office space in Washington at which time, more or

downtown location a combination business office
and living quarters, possibly at some such place
‘ as the 1028 Connecticut Avenue Building.

"“£. After. this test, Source will 'discover' that
‘he can best operate out of Washington and he will
then establish an office and purchase a house or
other accommodations and bring his family to Wash-
ington.

"g. At this point Source will be operating on

his own as a news gatherer. He will be established
as such and he will have access to the various
press conferences and other news making areas in
Washington and he will by necessity mingle with

the local newsmen and radio people.

"COMMENTS:

"The main question concerning the above plan was
whether or not this could be accomplished in a shorter
time guaranteeing soundness, logic, and security. Many
cy approaches were studied and for the reasons set out be-
pr low they were discarded as not workable or unsound. pe-

As far as we can now determine, there

is no suitable cover organization in Washington
\that would cover the movement of the Source into
iWashington, explain his presence there, and give
‘him a required freedom of movement in the area of
‘interest. We have no totally controlled newspaper
property, news bureau, or radio bureau in Washing-
ton, nor do we have any organization where Source
could be planted without creating a questionable
situation.

would do as a cover for bringing Source into

"4. Could Source obtain employment on a
Congressional Committee on either side of the
Hill which would give him access to the areas
of interest? :

"Source has exceptional connections on the
Hill and it is believed that through these con-
nections he might obtain some type of assign-
ment on a temporary basis or perhaps on a regular
basis. However, in the opinion of the SRS staff
this is exceptionally hazardous and if it became
known through some misfortune, it would be of
enormous embarrassment to Agency officials. In
addition, Source might well obtain employment
with the Congressional Committee, but his work
might be too limiting to permit him to move about
and it might well preclude any opportunity he had
of making contact with the local press. Further-
more, most Committee assignments, investigative or
otherwise, generally follow a 9 to 5 routine on
the Hill and free lancing and freedom of movement

are not easily obtained in Congressional Committees.

It is regarded as impossible to place Source on a
Congressional Committee if the employing Senator
or Congressman was ta be informed even in a most
nominal way of Scurce's mission.

"S. Can the basic plan be telescoped on a
shorter basis?

"This is considered questionable by those
who have worked in this area for some time. If
we shorten the approach, we would obviously cut
down on our Source's background and prestige,
particularly in an area where stature is neces-
sary. The articles using Source's by-line, if
they are successful, would be very important and
would serve as a basis for everything that would
follow. The South American trip is needed and
Source would have at the present time the best
possible chance for success based on his Cuban
contacts which are very strong at the present
time. A possibility also exists on such a trip
that Source might be fortunate enough to achieve
an important newspaper scoop which, of course,
would build prestige and quite conceivably place

his name prominently in the public eye. The
lecture tour, of course, is essential not only
for prestige purposes, but to make the necessary
survey to determine the best possible media for
Source if and when he ultimately moves to Wash-
ington.

"The long range proposal set out above ap-
pears to be the most secure and most logical way
into the target. If it is necessary to go after
a shorter method or a more direct approach, every
effort can be aimed at this. However, it is pos-
sible that a long range plan as set out above
might be used successfully in combination with a
shorter more direct plan unless the shorter plan
would result in the blowing of the Source pre-
maturely."

that it was hopeful his throat ail-
ment would soon clear which would
make it possible for him to visit
Washington within the next week or
two.

“It would seem prudent to me,
prior to Subject's pending visit,
that we prepare something akin to
an agreement or letter of instruc-
tion which would clearly indicate
to Subject that assignments to him,
whether oral or not, would eventually
be followed up by written confirma-
tion of such assignment. Such a
letter of understanding or agree-
ment would, it seems to me, serve
to protect Subject as well as the
Agency in the event of any further
problem or incident which might
involve Subject. For example,
many of Subject's activities may
be construed as domestic political
action and as such could be identi-
fied as an Agency contractual em-
ployee. From time to time, as you

. and may assume that such advice and
acknowledgement on our part would be
Agency approval for his activities.
While such is not the case, it is
believed that we should formalize
this part of our contract with him
so that he knows that his personal
activities, regardless of area, are
not construed as an extension of
Agency plans or programs. At the
same time, Subject can be assured
of our continuing interest in him
as a "standby" asset.

"Should you have any questions
concerning this subject, I would be
pleased to discuss them further."

Understanding, dated 29 April, signed by with an
indicated copy given to stating:

i PERSONAL ACTIVITY

Since 1966, specific assignments for OS have
been at a minimum, whereas his personal activities have
increased, Much of his personal activity has been or
might be construed as having been domestic political action.
In 1970, his name was placed as a candidate for U.S. Repre-
sentative from the 15th district of New Jersey, but he
failed to receive the nomination. However, in‘1972, he
did campaign as an Independent candidate: for the U.S. Senate
in New Jersey. He received approximately one per cent of the
ballots cast in the election won by Senator Clifford P. Case.

He has been active in and frequently the prime mover
in a number of organizations of conservative or right-wing
persuasion. As such, he has earned considerable reputation
as a capable coordinator and organizer through actions in
support of "pro-American" and conservative causes. The
parades, receptions, petition gathering, demonstrations
and other publicity making ventures in which he has par-

iu pated have run the ¢ t ef support tor the kenuoiic
@ of Vietnam, U.S. war policies, strong national defense pos-
ture, the Nationalist Chinese, U.S. prisoners in foreign

lands and anti-bussing for integration.

Among these organizations with which he has been pro-
minently identified are: :

Parents and Taxpayers: an organization opposing bussing
for integration. He was doing public relations for this group
as early as 1964 and has been periodically involved in this
activity with this and other organizations to date.

Free China Support Group and The Committee of 1,000,000:
these organizations are pro-Nationalist China and actively
opposed the U.S. recognition of the Peoples Republic of China.

Young Americans for Freedom: a conservatively oriented
youth group.

Committee to Unite America: as a member in 1971, he
was active in its efforts aimed at lowering the level of
public hostility toward government policies.

National Committee for Responsible Patriotism (NCRP):
as its Executive Director and one of its foundens in 1967,
he has been its principal member and has been involved
with managing its office, raising funds, and charting its
activities. Operating principally with volunteers and
donated funds, Wiley, who has occasionally received some
private remuneration for his services, has organized
numerous parades, receptions, motorcades, banquets and
programs. He has arranged publicity and made a number
of media appearances. In connection with these and other
activities he has had close contact with labor leaders,
the military and the White House. In April 1973,! Wiley
received a signed commendation from President Nixon in
recognition of his efforts, which states:

@ 1 TERMINATION

During the course of the reorganization of the Office
of Security, it was decided that the Security Research
Staff would be abolished. This decision led to the prepa-
ration of a memorandum for the Director of Security from
the Chief, Security Staff, dated 1 June 1973, captioned
"Request for Director of Security Assessment Regarding
Continuance of Functions and Possible Replacement." The
last paragraph of this memorandum stated:

"For immediate planning purposes, to
fulfill the early deadline already established,
it would be appreciated if you would review the
attached outlines of existing functions and in-
dicate your desires regarding thé function (con-
tinue, continue with low priority, discontinue)
and where you wish any retained functions to be
2ced in the reorganization structure. In the
ce, T have attempted to indi
_ the more likeiy options for this to facilitate

your assessment."

On 4 June 1973, the Director of Security indicated
that "Special Access Sources" should
continue on a low priority and be transferred to the Opera-
tional Support Branch.

On 8 June Hogs cannon iaae (SRS), in a memorandum
to the Chairman, Clearance Division Implementation Committee,
OS/PSI, reorganization subject "Research Branch, Clearance
Division, OS/DD/PSI, Implementation" noted that Special
Access Source had been approved to be continued,
but on a low priority basis and transferred to the Opera-
tional Support Branch.

Shortly after the implementation of the reorganization
of the Office of Security on 1 August 1973, Td

CONTACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS ' WITH

JAMES McCORD

i
James McCord was the first renteseutativelye the Office
of Security to have contact with and was undoubtedly
the driving force behind the A y's funding of the Daily
Worker index. McCord was primary case officer from
1956 through January 1962 an uring this period, guided and

was more or less responsible for direction and con-
trol,

The nature of McCord's contacts with after 1962
are not exactly known since McCord left SRS in January 1962
for other positions within the Office of Security. The files
do, however, contain the following information which indicate
some contact between McCord and after 1969. The exact
nature of these contacts is not definitely known, especially
those in May - June 1969; however, the presumption is that
at the direction of McCord may have reported on and
photographed anti-Viet Nam War demonstrations in Washington,
B. C., during t d and gave the results of his wosk to

McCord who re CIA on 31 August 1970.

have a close association with Pennington without; elaborating
as to specific details. For example: On March 1967,
prepared a report which states as follows - "In dealing wit
Don (Sweaney) and Lee (Pennington), both of whom know of my
connection, I avoid any talk of my company activities.

At one time, both knew some of my work because we received

cooperation from them on certain projects. However, since

Don went to his present job there has been little contact.

I talk to Don as I do to everyone else. I ignore any
questions or statements with double meanings, surreptitious
glances, etc. This is because of two reasons - need-to-know
rule and Don is seldom out of earshot of fellow workers. No
one overhearing us will learn anything I don't want them to
know.

"Since the recent exposure of company activities is
the chief topic of discussion, and especially since I am
considered by many as an ‘expert’ on one of the projects,
there is little way of avoiding the subject without arousing
suspicion. I have always taken the same stand, that of a
critic - but with qualifications - regarding the area of
my knowledge. Under the circumstances, it would be quite

impossible to take any ether position. i

"During my discussion with Don, the only company
business that was mentioned was the project with which
everyone knows I am familiar. It is, therefore, obvious
that I could not have said what was reported. I would
suggest that someone other than the original source talk
to Don. I would also urge that both Don and Lee be reminded
not to mention, under any circumstances, their knowledge of
me."

DONALD SWEANY

: knowledge of and association with Sweany is
not from the files, nor is there any
reference to any such association in the Office of Security
file on Donald Sweany. However, it can be presumed, based
upon their mutual association with Lee Pennington at the
American Legion, that they probably have known each other

since 1954. Other than comment concerning Penning-
, ton and Sweany, previously mentioned, there is nothing else
* from concerning Sweany.

i

HOWARD HUNT

There is nothing in the files to indicate any
contact or association with Howard Hunt. Sometime prior to
24 August 1970 and probably between the fall of 1969 and
April 1970, provided SRS with a manuscript entitled
"Give Us This Day," which was circulating amongst some New
York publishers none of whom wished to publish it because
of its controversial nature, i.e. Bay of Pigs operation.
The writer of the manuscript was ‘later identified as Howard
Hunt. The exact details concerning this incident are not
available in the files.

EEE on this theme, on 19 June 1973, called
of SRS to say that he had in his hands a copy
of Howard Hunt's manuscript "Give Us This Day." was
advised that he had probably forgotten but that we ha had
access to it several yea ago when Hunt submitted it to
a different publisher. reportedly had made it
@ available at that time). said that he believed that
this publisher was going to take advantage of the recent

‘i publicity (meaning Watergate apparently) and, of course,
bring it out under Hunt's true name. was told that
we (SRS) had no interest in his copy and that he could
return it to the contact who made it available to him.
There was no further discussion on the matter.
