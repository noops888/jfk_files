Tegucigalpa Station asset assigned to monitor certain Honduran

ham radio operators of interest to the Station, reported the

following, most unusual, conversation. On 14 June Mexico came

ham radio operator named Alfonso, call letters XRIWA. Cuban

Station told Alfonso to contact a famous band leader named

Antonio Maria Romero and kept referring to 'El Corsario Negro."

The Cuban station instructed Alfonso that once he contacted

Romero he should have him record 'Tres Lindas Cubanas."
