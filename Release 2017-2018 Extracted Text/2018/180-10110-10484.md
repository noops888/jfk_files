ADDENDUM TO FOOTNOTE # 614 OF "LEE HARVEY OSWALD, THE CIA

AND MEXICO CITY.

Some controversy has arisen in regard to the question

of whether the tapes existed at the time of the assass-

ination due to a memorandum from J. Edgar Hoover to the

head of the Secret Service which said:

The Central Intelligence Agency advised that

on October 1, 1963, an extremely sensitive

source had reported that an individual iden-

tified himself as Lee Oswald, who contacted the

Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring as to

any messages.

Special Agents of this Bureau,

who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas,

Texas, have observed photographs of the indi-

vidual referred to akove and have listened to

a recording of his voice.

These Special Agents

are of the opinion that the above-referred-to

individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald.

(Memorandum from Hoover to James J. Rowley, 11/23/63,

pp. 4-5.) The HSCA has determined that this statement

was probably based on ancther FBI memorandum which said:

Inasmuch as the Dallas Agents who listened to the

tape of the conversation allegedly of Oswald

from the Cuban Embassy to the Russian Embassy in

Mexico and examined the photographs of the visitor

to the Embassy in Mexico and were of the opinion

hat neither the tape nor the photograph pertainec

to. Oswald, I requested Shanklin to immediatel

send a photograph of Oswald to our Legal Attache.

• (Memorandum from Belmont to Tolson, 11/23/63, p. l. Mr.

Belmont was reporting the results of a conversation with

the Special Agent in Charge in Dallas, Gordon Shanklin,

that occured at 11:50 A.N.)

ADDENDUM: Page TWo.

Later that same day SAC Shanklin informed the Director

that the tape of Oswald's voice had been erased: "It

should be noted that the actual tape from which this

transcript was made has been erased." (Teletype from

SAC Dallas to Director, # 232220, 7:30 P.M. CST, 11/23/63.

Emphasis in the original.)

The confusion about whether or not there was a tape

apparently continued for several days after the SAC in

Dallas informed the Director that such a tape did not

exist. On 11/25/63 the FBI Legat in Mexico City sent a

Cablegram to the director which said:

There appears to be some confusion in that no

tapes were taken to [allas but only typewritten

transcripts supplied by CIA, the tapes not being

available because they had been erased.

(Cablegram #. 182 & 183, F. 2.)

The FBI was asked to explain the paragraph from the

Hoover memorandum quoted above. It responded:

The paragraph appearing on pages 4 and 5 of the

leterhead memorandum, which is quoted in your

(FBI) request of March 17, 1978, contains some

incorrect informatior

regarding a tape recording

of the voice of an irdividual who identified him-

self as Lee Oswald.

of the FBI indicates that this Bureau received

information derived from transcripts of tape

recordings furnished by another government

agency which conducts intelligence type inves-

The transcripts indicated that on

September

28, 1963, and October 1, 1963, the

voice of

an individual identifying himself as

Lee Oswald was recorded by the other govern

ment agency conducting intelligence type inves-

tigations. Additionally, this government agency

provided the FBI with photographs of an individ-

graphs being taken by said agency on October 1,

1963.

recording purporting to contain Lee Harvey

by the Committee recalled listening to any tape recording

purporting to contain a corversation involving Oswald.

Differences Between the Warren Commission

Investigation of Lee Harvey Oswald's

Activities

in

Mexico City and the House

Select Committee on Assassination's

Investigation.

The approach taken by this Committee's investigation

differs from that of the Warren Commission primarily

in terms of scope. The Warren Commission and the

investigative

agencies

at its disposal went to

great lengths to establish Oswald's travel to and

from Mexico, but devoted minimal effort to

evaluating Oswald's contacts with the Cuban and

Soviet Consulates. It is

the conclusion of this

Committee that the Warren Commission correctly

established that Oswald hae traveled to Mexico

City. Hence, this Committee has chosen not to

reinvestigate Oswald's travel to and from Mexico City.

Instead, the Committee's approach has been to focus

narrowly an Oswald's contarts with. the Soviet and

Cuban dipTomatic missions. n Mexico City and on

Oswald's activities in Mexico City outside of the

Soviet and Cuban installations.

The Warren

Report limited

its discussion of

Oswald's contacts with the Soviet and Cuban diplomatic

missions to information obtained from Sylvia Duran

and the Cuban Government. 1,

At one point in the Report the Commission referred

to other information:

By far the most important confirmation

of Senora Duran's testimony, however, has been

supplied by confidentia

sources of extremely high

reliability available to the United States in

Mexico.

The information from these sources

establishes that her testimony was truthful and

accurate in all materia

respects.

The identities

of these sources cannot be disclosed without

destroying their future usefulness to the

United States.2/

The Warren Commission d'd not print anything in

the twenty-six

its statement that Silvia luran's testimony was.

In an attempt to answer the questions posed by

Lee Harvey Oswald's visit to Mexico City in September

and October of 1963, the House Select Committee on

Assassinations has pursued the following investigative

i procedure:

i) Conducted extensive interviews, depositions,

and executive session hearings involving

Central Intelligence Agency personnel;

2) Interviewed Cuban c tizens who could have

knowledge of Oswald's sojourn

in Mexico;

3) Intarviewed Mexican citizens who could have.

knowledge of Oswald s activites and

essociations while le was in Mexico;

of the

Central Intelligence Agency and the

Federal Bureau of Investigation that

pertain to Oswald ald Mexico City.

Other evidence from the ClA

that the ClA's photo-surveillance

obtained a photograph of Lee Harvey

Oswald entering either or both the

denies that such a photograph exists.

Hence, the dispostion of this photograph

The reader should be advised at the outset

that the first section following is technical in

nature and may not appear cirectly relevant at

first blush. But the report is cumulative in nature.

The specific, detailed analyses of the standard

operating procedures in the first section are .

necessary to, and form a partial basis for, the

reconstruction of the Mexico City Station's

handling of the Oswald case. There are many gaps

left by the documentary and testimonial evidence

concerning the manner in which the ClA's Mexico

City Station and Headquarters reacted to Oswald's

presence in Mexico City. A knowledge of the

way in which the Mexico City Station operated and

the procedures involved in those surveillance

operations which detected Oswald is valuable in

filling the gaps of the specific case which is the

subject of this report.

Introduction

The Mexico City Station of the Central

Intelligence Agency maintained photographic

surveillance on the cuban diplomatic. compound during

September and. October of 1963.3/ The purpose of

this operation was to get identifiable photographs of

al1 individuals who visited the Cuban diplomatic

compound. 4/

Physical Positioning of Surveillance

Bases and Targets

The Cuban diplomatic compound covered one

city block in Mexico City between Tacubaya, Francisco

Marquez and Zamora Streets. The entrance to the Cuban

Embassy was located on the corner of Tacubaya and

Francisco Marquez. 5/ Next to this entrance on

Francisco Marquez Street was another entrance for

automobiles.6/ The entrance to the Cuban Consulate,

entrance to the Consulate from a second window in the

same third floor apartment. 10/

3. Objectives of Operation and Scope of

Coverage Provided

One CIA, officer, who claimed to have had a

marginal role in this surveillance operation, remembers

that they had trouble covering both the Cuban

Embassy entrance and the Consulate entrance. 1l/. "The

Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipment

using a pulse camera which frequently developed

mechanical difficulties."ll Two former CIA employees

who were in Mexico City in 1963 remembered that there

were two cameras

was covered along, with the Embassy entrance. 15/ Mr.

Phillips was not absolutely sure of his recollection,

but thought that it was possible that the Embassy

entrance had been covered ty a manned photographic base

and the Consulate entrance was covered by a pulse

camera. 16/

The CIA staff technician who serviced the

cameras and trained the agents at the CIA photographic

base that covered the Cubar. compound was interviewed

by the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The

technician stated that he had set up the cameras in

the photographic base at the inception of an

operation

30 September 1963.25/ The fispatch reports that on

23 September 1963 the agent who ran the Cuban

photographic basehouse called the technician into the

basehouse to discuss the layout of the Cuban

Consulate. 26/ The entrance to the Cuban Consulate had

been closed in 1961 due to narassment and stink

had once again opened its door to the public. Prior

to this

reopening of the Consulate door, the photography

agent had limited his coverage to the main Embassy

with a 30-power eyepiece.

The dispatch reported,

however, from the position he had to cover the main gate,

he could not cover the newly reopened Consulate

entrance. 29/ The base agent told the technician that at

that time, approximately seventy percent of all the

visitors to the Cuban compound were using the Embassy

entrance and the remainder ised the Consulate entrance. 30/

HMMA- 22307, paragraph 5, 6.311. It says that the

VLS-2 triggering device had been performing well with

little false triggering. The 500 mm lens was

replaced with a 6-inch lens so as to obtain wider

coverage of the Consulate door. 381 During the first

two weeks that the pulse camera was in operation,

the VLS-2 triggered the camera anytime that anyone

entered or. left the Consulate door. This dual

photography used an excessive amount of film, so the

The cable apologizes for tie delay in sending the

The cable suggests that

Headquarters retain possession

of the negatives and inforns Headquarters that

the

basis. 53/

A transmittal manifest is "unaccountable." 541

That means that the document and the material it

This dispatch is intended to familiarize

Headquarters with

the details of the Pulse

Camera operation in Mexico City, which was

mounted

in December 1963 and is targeted

against the (Cuban) Embassy and Consulate. 59/

The dispatch goes on to report that a technician from

Headquarters brought a pulse camera to Mexico City in

mid-December 1963, installed and tested it, and

instructed the technician resident in Mexico City and

the base agent in the use and maintenance of the camera. 60/

On the basis of HMMA-22307, HMMA-22433 and MEXI

9940, the Committee believes that it is probable that

the pulse camera was in operation on the days that

Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate. This

Committee requested the photographs produced by the

pulse camera by the project's cryptonym on 22 June 1978.

said, in part:

First, while admittedly there are contra-

dictions in the Agency's written records,

these records nevertheless suggest that an

Therefore, the committee reiterates its

request of May 2, including but not limited to

But the first pulse camera vas set up on Friday,

September 27, 1963. The documents do not specify the

days that the original cameras functioned. HMMA-22307

says:

(The base agent) was requested to test

the Robot Star Camera for four days and the

K-100 for another four days. 76/

HMMA-22433 says:

(The base agent) used the K-100 with a 152 mm

the 27th (the day it was installed), the 28th (a

The photographs from the manual camera were

routinely shown to a peneiration agent in the Cuban

Embassy for identification purposes. 101 After this

agent left the employment of the Cuban Embassy in

1965, the photographs were sent to the JMWAVE

Station in Miami, Florida or review by Cuban

defectors such as AMMUG/1.102/

The disposition of the pulse camera photographs

in general, beyond the fact that as of 1965, and

possibly earlier, the prodiction was routinely sent

to Headquarters, is unknow. 103/ The CIA denies

that the pulse camera was functioning during the time

Oswald was in Mexico. 104/ If the Committee's belief

that the pulse camera was functioning on the days that

Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate is correct, then

the ultimate disposition of the photographs produced

on those days

remains a mystery.

Photographic Surveillance Operations Aimed at

the Soviet Diplomatic Compound

1. Introduction

The Mexico City CIA Station maintained

photographic surveillance on the Soviet diplomatic

compound in Mexico City in 1963. Three photographic

sites, or bases, were used in this operation. 105/

The primary objective of the operation was to photograph

people who visited the Sov et Embassy. 106/ The

operation, generally, covered the main gate of

the Soviet. compound between 900 and 1800 (or dark)

on weekdays and from 900 tr 1400 on Saturdays. 107/

There were three bases which provided photn-

in 1963.109/ One of the bases overlooked the enclosed

garden or "backyard"

' area of the Soviet Embassy. 110/

The other two bases, of primary concern to this

Committee, covered the entrance to the Soviet

compound. Ill/ The primary base, LIMITED, was.

directly across the street intersection from the min

Soviet Embassy gate; the secondary, or "back-up,"

LILYRIC base was across the street and down a little

way from the main Embassy gate. 112/

3. Objectives of liperation and Scope of

Coverage Provided

The purpose of thi: operation has also been

described as being to obtin photographs of soviet

officials and their families; all foreigners

(non-Latins) who visited the Embassy; and cars with

foreign license plates.113/ One of the

main purposes

of the photographic bases that covered the Embassy gate

was to obtain a photograpn of every "foreigner," or

non-Latin, in contact with the Soviet Embassy. 114/

This was done in an attempt to identify possible

My understanding of that was that it was to

be used

to identify those people who might

be working for the soviets as espionage

agents who were U.S. citizens who went down

there driving a car with a U.S. license

the photographic bases and actually took the

photographs had an "uncanny ability" to pick out

foreigners.116/

The House Select Conmittee on Assassinations

the scope of the photographic

coverage on the main gate of the soviet Embassy. At

a minimum, the Embassy was probably covered by the

photographic operations during office hours. "The

Given the somewhat uneven nature of the coverage

maintained by LIMITED, 131/ the House Select Committee

on Assassinations staff asked whether the two bases

were run in conjunction so

as to provide more

comprehensive coverage.. Tromas Keenan, the project's

case officer, did not remember that this was the case.

He did

remember that both tases operated at the same

time so as to get the most complete coverage possible. 132/

Mr. Keenan was not sure whether there was routine

coverage of the Soviet Embissy on weekends. 133/ He

said that it was possible that there was routine

coverage on Saturday mornirgs. 134/

An examination of the project

file maintained

by the CIA on

the photographic coverage of the soviet

Embassy does not bear out Nr. Keenan's assertion

that the two bases duplicated efforts.. In fact, the

project file confirmed that the bases complemented each

other rather than duplicated efforts. This was the

The Station. feels that it would be helpful

to summarize at this time information

previously reported to Headquarters (see

paragraph 3, reference B) concerning the photo

basehouses

under this project and thereby

give Headquarters an updated frame of

reference

in which to view the roles of the

various basehouses.

The LIMITED and LILYRIC basehouses

provide coverage of front of the LIMERICK

installation.

Although on the surface it may

appear that these to basehouses provide

duplicate take,

this is not the case.

• It has

been the Station's experience in running the

unilateral LIEMPTY operation that a 0900 to

evening workday, which would be required of

a single basehouse in order to cover the

LIMERICK target effectively, is just too long

for any pair of agerts to remain effective.

This is especially true when it is considered

that these basehouse operators. are essentially

unsupervised during their workday.

It would

also be impossible ior a single base-house to

provide the kind of coverage this station needs

on the target insta lation, especially during

the peak hours of artivity, namely late

morning and.early. a ternoon.

For these

reasons, the LILYRIl; basehouse generally

operates from 0900 :o 1400 or 1500 weekdays.

LIMITED operates from 1200 to 1800 or dark

as the daily situacion dictates on weekdays,

and 0900 to 1400

on Saturdays.

(These hours

are subject to chane to fit

Station

needs.)

Special coverage fo Sunday is arranged on a

need basis; however, past experience

has shown

regular coverage of

Saturday afternoons and

Sundays is not rewarding.

during the peak activity hours of the LIMERICK

target.

Although even this arrangement is not

completely airtight, anything less than this

would present unacceptable gaps in the coverage.

It must also be considered that without

two basehouses covering the front of the

target installation, any illness, personal

problem or vacation

for operators of one

basehouse would terninate Station coverage...

It is the Station's opinion that as. long as

the LIMERICK installation is a prime target of

the Station, it will be necessary to maintain

the present

three bisehouses.

To eliminate

any

one of the three would create a gap in the

4. Procedure and Timing Involved in Processing

Production from the Operation

The CIA photographic bases were manned by at

least one agent who took photographs and kept a log

sheet of people entering and leaving the Embassy and

of the photographs that he took. 146/ The film

remained in the camera until the whole role

was

often

exposed, wh Classticatiok

After the assassination of John Kennedy, this

procedure was changed and tre film was cleared from

the camera on a daily basis. 148/

The CIA contract agent outside of the United

States Embassy who was in charge of the photographic

bases was Ramon-Joseph Alvarez Durant. 149/ Alvarez

picked up the film, prior to the assassination, from

the photo bases three times a week. 150/ Alvarez

then took the film to his brother-in-law, who worked

at night, to develop it. The brother-in-law also

printed the film into eight-by-ten contact prints. 151/

After the film was developed and printed, Alvarez

turned over the negatives and contact

prints to

Thomas Keenan. 152/

production if Mr. Keenan was not available. 153/ Mr.

5. Responsibility for the Operation

There is some controversy as to who had

overall responsibility for this project. Ms. Good-

pasture testified that the responsibility was Mr.

Keenan's. 156/ Mr. Keenan, according to Ms. Good-

pasture, made all the decisions and had all the

responsibility involved in the operation. 157/ Mr.

Keenan was the most junior Operations Officer in

the Mexico City Station in 1963, and claims that his

role in the operation was largely limited to legwork. 158/

Ms. Goodpasture testified that her role in the

operation was limited to acting as an alternate

Case Officer, internal rousing of the production,

and review of the photographs to insure the maintenance

of technical quality in the operation. 159/ Ann

Goodpasture's annual Fitnes Report for the period

1 January 1963 to 31 December 1963 specifies her

duties in regard to this operation. The fitness

Coordination of Photographic and Electronic

Surveillance Operations

The Mexico City Station employed an operating

procedure whereby the functioning of the photographic

base and the electronic intercept base could be

coordinated. If the listering post monitor heard

something that would lead tim to believe that there

was someone at one of the Embassies that should be

photographed, he would alert the ClA technician in

the listening post who would then alert Ann Good-

pasture. 181/ Ms. Goodpasture could then alert

Thomas Keenan who would then notify the photographic

base. 182/ The reporting to Headquarters of information

generated by the photograptic surveillance operation

and the electronic operation was also coordinated. 183/

The station was able to go back to the photographic

chronological file to chect for photographs of

people that were picked up on the tap operation when

the transcripts were revieved. 184/ It was a matter

of routine to check the photographic production when

A review of the transcripts produced by this

to this Committee from three Cuban lines:

14-42-37,

14-13-26, and 25-09-14.207' It is noted that the last

telephone line was not listed in the monthly reports. 208/

a fifteen-year hiatus, in placing: this tap in 1963.214/

telephone was tapped in 1944.

that the tapes were held fur two weeks in the station

before they were erased and sent back to Arehart

Thomas Keenan spent a lot of time in the Station

(c) English Language Conversations

There are some indications that English

language conversations were transcribed at the

listening post. The Tab F Draft says:

Reels which contained Russian or a language

other than Spanish or English were taken to

another location Tother than the listening

posty for translation and typing. 251/

Goodpasture's notes say:

Those transcripts which

had Russian or another

language

besides

Spanish

or English went out of the

(of the"

conversatiors on the reel) was typed.

These reels were talen to another location where

would have to be taien to another location

to be

picked up the day after the date on which

it

occurred was in the Spanish language, normally. 253/

This statement in the original. Mexican report given

to the CIA in Mexico after the assassination would

tend to add credence to Ms. Tarasoff's

recollection that Oswald mentioned to the Soviets

that he had also tried to elicit aid from the Cubans. 347/

At least one other CIA official who was in Mexico

also remembers that Oswalc indicated in his

discussions with the soviet Embassy that he hoped

to receive assistance with the expenses of his trip. 348/

Daniel Stanley Wation, a retired CIA employee

who was Deputy Chief of

he Mexico City Station from

1967

told the Hoise Select Committee on •

Assassinations staff that he had seen a file on Oswal

in Mexico City that contained only one or two intercept

transcripts and surveillance photographs of Oswald. 349/

Mr. Watson also told HSCA staff investigators that Win

Scott had a private personal safe in which he maintained

especially sensitive materials.350/ According to

Mr. Watson, these materials were removed from the safe.

by Mr. Scott contained in these materials lend

circumstantial support for Ms. Tarasoff's testimony.

One of these pertains to

Lee Harvey. Oswald and what I know (emphasis

he arrived in Mexico, his contacts by

telephone and his visits to both the soviet

and Cuban Embassies and his requests for

assistance from thee two Embassies in trying

he cited a promise

from the Soviet Embissy in Washington that they

would notify their imbassy in Mexico of

Oswald's plan to as: them for assistance. 353/

In his unpublished manuscript, Scott refers to a

conversation in which Oswald gave the Soviet Embassy

"his name very slowly and carefully. "354/ Although

an hour or two, Ms. Scaleti had

located the photograph of swald visiting the soviet

Embassy in Mexico City. 379' Mr. Agee went on to

say:

I don't know, don't recall in factghow she

had been able to re:oncile or how they were

able to reconcile in Mexico City the photo-

graph with the name, unless someone had

known the face.

Because the problem with

these observation posts is that you can get

a lot of photographs from them, but to find

out the exact identity of the people is not

always an easy thing to do. And it may be

that as they were listening to the telephones

•of the Soviet Embassy, and also the Cuban

Embassy, that she remembered the name Oswalde

or Lee Harvey Oswald from the telephone tap,

if in fact he had identified himself over the

telephone, and tried to make an appointment

with the consul or whoever.

And then they

were able somehow to reconcile the telephone

conversation with the photograph that was

taken from the observation post the same day

or more or less whenever the appointment was

made.

On the other hand it may be that this

photograph had not been identified until the

time of the assassination but that she had

heard or recalled

perhaps either reading the

transcript from the telephone tapping or

getting a condensed

report perhaps a weekly

report or something of the take from the

telephone tap that she remembered the name

, Lee Harvey Oswald and then went back into

the files of all the photographs and looked

d. HSCA Investigation of the possibility that

the Mexico City Photosurveillance Operation

Produced a Photogr.iph of Lee Harvey Oswald

(1) Introduction

This Committee has conducted a general investigation

into the CIA's photographic surveillance operations in

in addition to the.

Mexico City in 1963 as wellis a specific investigation

into the allegations mentioned above. 444/

In an attempt to dete: mine whether the CIA's Mexico

City photographic bases did, in fact, photograph Oswald,

this Committee requested the CIA to make available to

the HSCA the production of these bases. 445/. The CIA

has in part responded to thi:; request. 446/ However,

the production from LILYRIC; the second base

that

covered

the Soviet Embassy entrance, and the pulse camera that

covered the Cuban Consulate intrance, has not been made

available for review.

447/ the Agency's withholding of

certain production materials from the photographic bases

has prevented the Committee from determining whether a

photograph

of Lee Harvey Oswild was taken by these photo-

surveillance operations.

Also in the course of its general investigation

into the CIA's surveillance operations in Mexico City

City, or worked in 1963 at CIA Headquarters in support

of Mexican operations. They iniformly testified that

the Station had not obtained a photograph of Oswald from

the photosurveillance operations in Mexico City. 448/

(2) Investigation of the Allegations

Ms. Elsie Scaleti worked on the Mexico Desk in

1963. 449/ Ms. Scaleti couli not recall her particular

responsibilities while she was assigned to the Mexico

Desk. 450/ She told the HSCA that she would have been

doing routine case officer work which would have involved

name traces, projects, budgets, et cetera. 451/ She

could not recall any specifis projects

that she worked on

and she stated

that the case officers on the desk would

not have had

specific titles such as. "Chief of Support

Operations." 452/ She stated that the work of the Desk

was assigned to the case officers by project and that

work that was levied that was not part of an assigned

project would have been done by anyone on the desk who

happened to be available. 453/

After the assassination the ClA's Mexico City Station

passed copies of seven of the above listed conversations to

the U. S. Embassy Legal Attache. 471/

The 9/27/ 10:30 and the

9/27 1:25 calls listed above are not included in this

dissemination. 472/ The cover memorandum states:

Attached are photostatic copies of transcripts

of

all conversations from technical operations

of this offisg which are possibly pertinent in

this case.

The HSCA has not beel able to determine why the 9/27

10:30 and 9/27 1:25 calls were not included in this memorandum.

While the 1:25 call could bi: considered unrelated, it is

unlikely that the same would apply to the 10:30 call since

the 9/27 10:37 call is inciuded in the memorandum.

At the bottom of eact attachment page to the Scott

memorandum, a summary of the conversation is provided. 474/

The Station questioned the relevancy of only one of the seven

calls presented in the mmorandum. The summary of the 10/3

call says:

states that he is seeking e visa, not that he is. checking on

an application already made. The majority of the evidence

indicates that Lee Harvey (swald could not speak Spanish. 476/

In light of Delgado's assertions, it is possible that

Oswald had at least a limited knowledge of Spanish. It should

true in light of Delgado's allegations and the 9/27 10:30,

9/27 10:37 and 9/27 1:25 calls which were also in Spanish. 473/

The record reflects that Oswald had the phone numbers

of both the Soviet Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache in

his notebook. 479/

It can not be determined when Oswald

entered the numbers in the lotebook. Since Oswald had previously

called the Consulate it is likely that he had the number prior

to 3 October.. It is also clear that Oswald knew that the

Consulate was responsible for issuing visas due to his prior

dealings with the Soviet and Cuban. Consulates. Thus, it is

probable that the 10/3 convursation did not pertain to Oswald.

Reconstruction of the ClA Mexico City Station and Headquarters

•Actions Prior to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

A .

Introduction--CIA Interest in and Liaison with FBI

Regarding American Citizens in Contact with Soviet

Bloc Embassies in Mexico City.

The Central Intelligence Agency has claimed that no

investigation of Oswald was made in Mexico prior to the

assassination of President Kennedy. For this reason, the

Agency claimed, the fact that Oswald was seeking a

visa and that he had also been to the Cuban Embassy was

not discovered until after the assassination:

It was not until 22 November 1963, when the

Station initiated a review of all transcripts

of telephone calls to the soviet Embassy that

the Station learned that Oswald's call to the

Soviet Embassy on 1 (ctober 1963: was in con-

bassy in an attempt lo obtain a visa allowing

him to transit Cuba.

Inasmuch as Oswald wis not an investigative

responsibility of the CIA and because the

Agency had not received an official request from

those agencies havin! investigative responsibili-

ty requesting the Aguney to obtain further in-

formation, the Station did nothing other than

ask Headquarters on

•5 October for a photograph

of. Oswald. 497/

Neither of the above assertions. is accurate. An

analysis of the information available will show that the

first assertion of the abov! quote, that the Station did

not learn of Oswald's contait with the Cuban Consulate and

A cable reporting Lee Oswald's contact with the

Soviet Embassy was written and sent to Headquarters by

Ms. Manell on

10/8/63. Various reasons have been ad-

vanced to explain the seven day delay in sending this

cable. David Phillips explained the delay by saying

that Mr. Manell. was too busy to be bothered by something

of such a routine nature. 5161. Phillipa, stated:

Mr. Manellwas a busy

man, sometimes

pro

crastinating. His wife was working for

him, and on one or tho occasions I spoke

to Mr. Manell kiddingly saying, hey, where

is the cable about this fellow, or something

like that, or maybe to his wife.

I am not

sure.

In

any event, what happened a few

days passed and Mrs. Manel prepared a

message-- she was working for her husband,

and as I recall it,ste typed it herself,

but 1 am not positive on that point, but

in any event, she prepared the cable

and took it to Mr. Minell at which time he

signed off on it.

Diring that process, it ong

did come to me, also to sign offa because

it spoke about Cuban matters, and then went 517

to the Chief of Station and was released. 577/

A blind CIA memorandom entitled "Delay in sending

the first cable about Oswale" was located in a soft file

on the Unidentified Man photograph. This memorandum as-

serts that Dave Phillips."d' dn't know what he was talking

about." The memorandum's aisertion is correct. Mr. Manel

with the soviet Embassy. 518/ Mr. Phillips did not sign

off on that cable. 519/ The cable did not mention any-

thing about the Cuban Consulate or Oswald's contact with

porary duty assignment in Washington, D.C., and Miami,

Florida, from at least late September

to October 9,

1963. 522/

The blind memorandum referred to above regarding

the delay offers another explanation for the seven

day lapse before sending the cable. After explaining

that the photoproduction would not have arrived at the

Station until Monday, 7 October, the memorandum says:

A name trace could hive been requested on

the basis of the name alone but that wasn't

the way Win Scott ran

that Station.

He

wanted the photographic coverage tied in

with the telephone coverage...sometimes

there was a U.S. automobile license num-

It was also pait of the

game of justifying project by the nume

ber of dispatches, cubles or reports pro-

duced. 523/

In all likelihood the delay in sending this ini-

tial cable was due to a comination of factors.

Mr. Manell

testified that, in fact, he was not too concerned with the

task and left it to his wif:.

The only action 1 took was the action my

wife took, was to send the cable to Wash-

ington summarizing the information we had

on Oswald and his contact with the Embassy...

We also asked

our headquarters for a trace

of an American. That was routine. 524/

The delay could also have been partially due to the wait

for the photo-production. Ms. Goodpasture did check the

photographs and did add a paragraph to the cable concern-

ing a photogarph. 5251

Another reason that the cable was delayed was

that there was some question within the station about who

It was just a

little, not

argument, but a discussion about, well,

"you do

handle it I don't want to do it, you

and I had to

do it. 526/

The reason that the responsibility would have

lain with the soviet Section is obviously because the

American was in contact with the soviet Embassy. Ms.

Goodpasture also had a potential basis for responsibility

because she was

responsible for liaison functions with

the Legal Attache, Army, Nayy and Air Force on routine

couter-espionage cases. 527/ She also assisted the

Chief of Station and Deputy Chief of Station on these

cases as they occurred. 528,

The primary reason for the delay was most likely

a combination of the respon: ibility dispute and the

routine nature of the case is perceived by the ClA-of-

ficers at that time.

Important or significant information was usually

sent to Headquarters by cable as opposed to the slower dis-

patch which was sent to Headquarters by diplomatic courier.

Cables were sent if the information was

of such a

nature that it had to be acted

on within a day or a day and half. or two

days. Dispatches took so long that you

really could not take any kind of opera-

tional action predicated on dispatch. 530/

Mr. Manell, the Chief of the Soviet Section in

Mexico City recalled that the criterion for a cable as

opposed to a dispatch was the perishability of the informa-

tion being transmittedy:

The normal criterion would be the urgency

attached to that information, the perish-

ability of the information, not its im-

portance necessarily.

The perishability

was the criterion...If it was something

that concerned an

event that was going to

happen in the two or three days you did

not want to use a medium which was going

to take a week to get to Washington. 531/

Hence, it is possible that Oswald's contact

was

reported by cable because it was considered significant

by the Mexico Station; but this interpretation is not

supported by the weight of the testimony.

Two other. criteria for reporting by cable were

pointed out: information corcerning Soviets, Cubans and

Americans.

fairly routine. 534/ The tegimony indicates that the

not. 535/. The Station had instructions to report Ameri-

This committee cannot be certain that other "U A'M"s

1963. 561/ The cable, as wa: routine, went to the

Mexico Desk for action. 562/ The person who handled

the case for the Mexico Desk was Elsie Scaleti. 563/

Ms. Scaleti initially considured the information

routine. 564/ She took the routine steps of request-

ing a name trace. 565/ From the name trace she learned

that there was a 201 file on a Lee Henry Oswald but

that it was restricted to a branch of the Agency known

as "CI/SIG." 566/ The custodian of Oswald's file,

in October 1963, was Ann Eli:abeth Goldsborough Egerter

of the Counter-Intelligence/special Investigations

Group. This group's purpose and interest in Oswald

is detailed in another section

of ths final report deal-

ing with whether or not lee swald was an agent or asset

of the Central Intelligene Agency. 567/

Ms. Scaleti went to Mi. Egerter and asked

_to

see Lee Oswald's file which vas provided to her by Ms.

Egerter. 568/ Once the information from the Oswald 201

and the information in the cable from Mexico. City was

combined, the Oswald contact took on more significance:

Q: Now,

once the information...had been

obtained by you, did that in any way

increase the significance of Oswald's

contact with the Soviet Embassy?.

the Soviet Embassy would lead one to

there was a possib lity he really was

Ms. Egerter remembers that the cable from Mexico

City caused a lot of excitement. She was shown the 10/9

cable.

Q: Is this the cable :hat cause the excitement?

A: Yes, one of them.

Q: Why was excitement caused by this cable?

A: "Contact with Kostikov."

Q: What is the significance of the contact with

Kostikov?

A: I think we considered him a KGB man.

Q: Any other reason for the excitement?

A: He had to be up to something bad to be so an-

that is the way l felt. 570/

to the Mexican Desk where it reamined until the time of

The teltype which Ms.icaleti wrote was sent to

the Department. of State, the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation and the Department of the Navy. 571/ This tele-

type says:

1. On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive

source in Mexico reported that an American

male, who identified himself as Lee Oswald,

contäcted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City inquiring whether the Embassy had

re-

ceived any news concerning a telegram

which had been sent to Washington.

The

American was described as approximately 35

years old, with an atheletic build, about

six

feet tall, with a receding hairline.

2. It is believed thet Oswald may be identical

to Lee Henry Oswald, born on 18 October

1939 in New Orlears, Lousiana, a former U.S.

Marine who defected

to the Soviet Union in

October 1959 and

ater made arrangements

through the United States Embassy in Moscow

to return to the united States with his Rus-

sian wife, Marina Nikolaevna Pusakova, and

their child.

3. The information in Paragraph One is being

disseminated to your representative

Any furthe information received is

being made availa le to the Immigration and

Naturalization Service. 578/

documents are the dissimilar descriptions of Oswald. The

Ms. Egerter testified that he could not explain why the

there was a rule that prevented the Agency from dissem-

of Oswald which. was from information furnished to the

Agency by the State Department could not be included in

Scaleti that the information in the second paragraph of

the teletype was from the !tate Department sources and

to State, FBI and lavy, we did not, and 1

would not normally even today, provide

those investigativ: agencies with the

physical description of Lee Henry Oswald

as we thought it to be then.

We provided them only with our intelli-

gence, not with Stite Department intelli-

gence which gave tie stuff out about the

audio and the possible physical descrip-.

tion.

The wording here in paragraph l on

our teletype... is vorded that the American

was described. As I told your man from

your committee earlier, it possibly would

have been better, although it did not occur

to me at the time and this is the way those

things were written in those times, to say

that an American described as this

could

possibly be identifiable and qualified

but the normal procedure in 1963 was to

provide to the other government agencies

information and intelligence from our

sources.

Q: Were you aware when you sent out the cable

and the teletype that you were giving differ-

ent descriptions?

A: Yes.

I assume I was. I don't remember now.

Ms. Scale:i was shown the 10/9

cable on that occasion she sated that she would not have

taken the description of the ndividual in paragraph two

to be a description of Oswall. 584/ The description

discrepancy was specifically pointed out to Ms. Bustos

and she was specifically queitioned on that point.. The

report of that interview says:

We next

pointed out to Ms. Scaletti the

fact that the response to Mexico had a

correct description of Oswald and the dis-

semination had an incorrect one.

She said

that the info in the first paragraph of the

dissemination came from MEXI 6453 and that

explained the incorrect description.

We

pointed out to her the fact that she had the

correct description and that had already

told us that she did not associate the de-

scription in 6453 with Oswald, and that she

had said that the cable and teletype had been

prepared simultaneously by. three knowledgable

people.

She said, first, that the correct

description would not have been put in the

dissemination because it came from the file

review.

I pointed out that all of the infor-

mation

in the second paragraph of the dissemina-

tion was from the file review.

She responded

that they had not been sure that the "Lee Os-

wald" referred to in 6453 was the same as

"Lee

Henry Oswald" on whon they had a file, hence

they would not have tad included a description

from 6453 that she did not think was connected

to Oswald.

She said that it had obviously

been a

mistake that coesn't matter now,

cause she was not sure that either applied to

the Embassy in Mexico.

585/

The second point of interest that is illustrated

by the 10/10 cable and teletype is the inference that can

be made from reviewing paragraph 3 of the teletype, para-

graph 5 of the cable, and Thomas Karamessines signing

off on the cable, that the ClA was asking for, and pro-

mising, a further investigation of Oswald without a speci-

Herbert shanell,

1ehe chief of the Soviet Section in Mexico City

recognized such a routine irvestigative responsibility as

part of the normal course of his duties. He stated :

One of our responsib: lities was to assist

the FBI in identifying people who might be-

come Soviet agents, particularly in America. 586/

Late

As a matter of fact, the Chief of the Branch of

the ClA responsible for the Mexican operations at Head-

quarters thought this was one of the Mexico City Station's

strongest and most successfil areas of endeavor.

They (Americans) wer: detected

enough so

that J. Edgar Hoover used to glow every

time that he thought of the Mexico City

Station.

This was one of our outstanding

areas of cooperation with the FBI. 587/

The request for further investigation and dis-

semination contained in paragraph 5. of the 10/10 cable to

Mexico was the reason that. the cable was sent to the

Assistant Deputy Director of Plans for release. 588/

The Chief of the Mexico Branch was

questioned extensively

on this point:

A: Well, it went up to Mr. Karamessines be-

cause

it involved disseminating information

on an

American citizen to the U.S. government

agencies, you see. At that time--probably

still--the CIA die not investigate or pass

around informatior on American citizens un-

less it were requested to by another govern-

ment agency, either in that particular case

or by some standard operating procedure.

In other words, tle CIA,, seeing an American

abroad, observing an American abroad, observ-

ing an American abroad engaging in some

skullduggery, woud inform the responsible

U.S. agency here ind sit and wait for instruc-

tions before doing anything further.

In

this case, we were passing on information

to other U.S. government agencies in Mexico

City and this probably went to other places

in Washington as well.

Q: This particular information was disseminated

to other agencies without a request of any

such .agency.

Is that correct?

A: Yes.

Q: This fit into the other category of cases

where disseminations were made?

A: Disseminations

would be made to other interested

agencies, and any information we came across

had action taken to follow up to take investi-

gative steps. Dissemination would only be taken

if another agency requested it, either specifically

in that case, or unless it were a part of standard

operating procedure, which would have been agreed

upon with another agelcy.

Q: Was

any follow-up action contemplated byalthe

10/10) cable?

A: Yes.

"Please keep Heidquarters advised of any

further contacts or for positive identification

•of Oswald. "

Q: That would be considered follow-up?

A: Yes:

They were instricted to stay alert and report

any further evidence of thisman's presence.

it.

Q: Mr. Karamessines had io sign off on it because

follow-up action was :ontemplated?

A: With regard to a U.S. citizen abroad.

Q: For purposes: of clarification, I think you said

that there were two situations where Mr. Karamessines

would have to sign off.

One would be where another

agency requested the lissemination?

A: Yes.

No--not the question of the dissemination.

It is a question of overational action being taken.

Q: A request for operational action. What is the second

example?

Q: Would the Agency itself decide to take operational

action?

would not require Mr. Karamessines approval at all.

or an agreement, with the FBI that any activities

by Americans around the Soviet or Cuban Embassy

up on by the Agency,

Was that agreement in writing?

A: I do not know.

It probably was in writing

some-

where.

It antedated my tenure, and the agreement

was not in the files.

It would have been

in the

files of the DDP or of the Cl Staff. 5891

The Chief of the Mexico Branch hence believes that

further

investigation of Oshald was requested by CIA;

Headquarters

without the prior expression of interest

from another government agercy with "investigative respon-

sibility. " This request for "operational activity" concern-

ing an American

abroad is ailvanced as the reason for the

Assistant Deputy Director o: Plans signing off on the

cable. Even though the cable was brought to Karamessines'

attention

and he did sign off on it, Mr. Scelso told this

Committee that that was not necessary due to a standing

agreement with the FBl under which the CIA had agreed to

investigate Americans in Mexico in contact with the Soviet

Embassy without any specific request from another agency. 590/

This recollection is corroborated by other testimony and

documents. 591/ Elsie Scaleti also recalled that it would

not have been necessary, in 1963, to bring such a request

for operational action to the ADDP's attention. 592/

attention did not have to do with the request for operational

action, but because Oswald's contact was considered impor-

tant enough to merit his attention:

Q: Why would someone as righ up in the organiza-

tion as Karamessines

ask to be the releasing

officer of this particular cable?

A: I can only surmise now that I might have thought

or what several of us

might have thought at

the time, that since it

involved somebody of

this nature who had tried to renounce his citi-

zenship, who was in the Soviet Union, married

to a Soviet, got out with a Soviet wife pre-

sumably, which is very strange, and now the con-

tact with the Soviets, we could

have a security,

a major security problem.

This was one way of

informing him

and getting attention at the

higher level. 593/

Even though the CIA denies such an agreement (if it

was in writing) that covered the ClA's investigation of

American citizens in Mexico, this Committee is certain,

on the basis of the above detailed evidence, that such

an agreement existed, either formally or informally. 594/

Hence, the assertion in the 1977 IG report that "Oswald

was not an investigative responsibility of the CIA" 595/

is seemingly inaccurate and misleading.

This Committee has attempted to determine what

actions, if any, were taken by the ClA's Mexico City Sta-

tion after Headquarters responded to the initial report

of Oswald's contacts with the Soviet Embassy. In this

respect, two assertions of the

'77 IGR are important:

1) that it was not discovered that Oswald was seeking a

visa to Russia. and that he hid also been in contact with

the Cuban Embassy until Noveliber 22, 1963; and 2) that

the Station did "nothing other than

ask Headquarters

on 15 October for a photograph of Oswald" because no

other government agency had mide an official request for

further information. 596/ "t has already been shown

that the "official request" :hat the Agency claims was

CIA Headquarters requested'a follow-up on the information

that the Oswald matter, afte the name trace, was done

at Headquarters, was considered to be fairly significant

by the Headquarters officials involved. In this regard,

it should be pointed out that Headquarters communicated

its concern to Mexico by requesting in paragraph 5 of

making an official request for further action. Hence,

the excuse offered for the c'aimed lack of action by the

Mexico Station is invalid and the question becomes 1) whe

ther or not that Station did any follow-up; 2) whether

they did discover additional information about Oswald

"prior to the assassination; 3) whether that information,

if any, was reported in an a:curate and expeditious man-

in Lee Harvey Oswald's Mexico City "p" file along with

the Station routing slip. There are several interesting

aspects to this copy of the cable and there is evidence

that provides indications of the Stations' actions and

the

timing of those actions.

There are several marginal notations on this docu-

notation wa: made by Win Scott when he

Scott knew, at the time the cable was received, that Lee

Oswald's middle name was not "Henry." David Phillips

was questioned about that possibility:

Q: Do you have

any reason to believe that when

this cable was received in October of 1963 Mr.

Scott knew that cable's reference to Lee

Harvey Oswald was incorrect?

A: No, I don't recall that, but reading this ob-

viously at whatever time

he wrote that "sic"

on there he felt it was incorrect or he would

not have spotlighted it that way.

But I don't

have any recollection. I don't have any re-

collection that we knew before this cable came

back down that it was Lee Harvey Oswald. 599/

The explanation most often advanced was that Mr.

Scott often used the symbols "Sic" and "aka" interchang-

eably and that all he was indicating here was that the

"Lee Oswald" from the taps was also tobe indexed

and

filed under the additional name "Lee Henry Oswald."

interchanged or used interchangeably the words,

the letters "aka"

and "sic" interchangeably

that?

Barbara Manell noted that the dis-

Oswald's Mexico "p". file was opened on or about 15 Octo-

of Oswald's contact with the Soviet Embassy in the eyes

of the Mexico City Station just as the name trace results

A: Oh, yes, sure, it did. The fact that he had that

kind of background.

Sure, he became someone of

considerable operational interest.

Again, there

was nothing other thun operational interest.

Q: In all liklihood tha: cable would have prompted

the people at the stition

to ,90 back and look at

the earlier transcripts?

A: Yes, I would think so. 6101

This committee believes that Station personnel did,

between October 11 and October 15, go back and recheck

the transcripts and connect the important substantive

calls to Oswald. Under nornal operating procedures a

tape of Oswald's calls to the Soviet Embassy should not

have been erased until 16 O:tober, 4 to 5 days after

the case took on added significance. 61l/ The one trans-

cript of the call on 10/1/63 that had definitely been

linked to Oswald prior to riceipt of the 10/11 cable bore

a reference to an earlier conversation by a man who

spoke broken Russian, the tuxt of the 10/1 call allowed

that the prior call had probably occurred on September 28,

1963. 612/ It should have been possible at that point

to compare the tapes to see if they were in fact the same

caller. Indeed, a notation made by Ann Goodpasture on a

newspaper article in 1964 suggests that this was the case.

The notes says:

The caller from the Cuban Embassy was uniden-

The cable traffic after the assassination confuses

this point rather than clarifies it. This will be dealt

with

in more detail in a subsequent section. An examina-

tion of documents in Lee Harvey Oswald's Mexico City Sta-

tion P file and

the cable traffic from Mexico City to

that at least one tape of (swald's voice existed as late

Assuming that the 10/1/63 call in which

an individual

identifies himself as "Lee Oswald" was handled in an ex-

been in the station by the following day at the latest. 615/

If the tape had been held for the normal two-week reten-

October. The tape from the 9/28/63 conversation would

have probably been in the : tation by the first or second

October.

An examination of he documents does not clarify

this question but rather add: confusion to the issue.

Several documents and cables deal with the tapes and

a voice comparison of the re:orded conversations. In

Oswald's "p" file there is a newspaper clipping of an

article from the 21 October 1964 Washington Post. The

article, by Robert S. Allen ind Paul Scott, is entitled

"CIA Withheld Vital Intelligence from Warren Commission."

One paragraph

from that arti:le says:

The investigators also are trying to determine

why the ClA in its preassassination report to

the State Department on Oswald's trip to Mexico

City gave details only of the defector's visit.

to the Russian Embassy

and not the Cuban Embassy.

The CIA did not report the

latter visit until after

Kennedy's assassination in

Dallas.

• Next to that paragraph Ann Goodpasture wrote:

The caller from the Cuban Embassy was unidenti

fied until HQ sent traces on Oswald and voices

compared by (Tarasoff). 617/

That statement is very clear in saying that a voice

comparison was

made. The cable traffic that went from

Mexico to CIA. Headquarters after the assassination is

not so clear.

On 23 November, the CIA leadquarters asked the

Mexico City Station to

send he full transcripts of 0s-

wald's conversations and "or ginal tapes if available"

to Headquarters as

soon as possible by a special courier. 618/

On that same day, Ann Goodpa:ture sent a cable to Head-

quarters reporting the 9/28/3 conversation. That cable

said, in part, "Station unable compare voice as first

one,

that Oswald had

seen requesting a visa,

if it had been sent to ClA headquarters, would

his case prior. to the assassination have been

'handled

in any. different manner?

A: It would have been in the case of dissemina-.

tion of information asout him,

but I do not

think that any operational action would have

taken to apprehend hin or to contact him or

to try to force him bick to the United States.

Q:

•How would the dissemination have been

treated differently?

A: Well, it simply means that we would have dis-

seminated any additional information that we

got. 657/

It- cannot

be determined vith exactitude whether or

not this additional information about Oswald was reported

to Headquarters. In all likelihood it was not. The Chief

of the Mexico Desk was asked whether or not the Station

was ever criticized for this failure to report in the

face of a specific request to do so by CIA Headquarters.

He splied:

No.

We were

trying to follow the Soviets and

all the satellites ard the Cubans.

At the same

was to attempt to recruit Russians, Cubans and

handling of the Oswald cast prior to the assassination

can best be summed up in Dive Phillips! response

he was asked how he would haracterize that handling:

Mr. Scott was not the only person in the Mexico Station

Oswald. Mr. Manell testified on this pointy:

Q: As of the day of the assassination, you

thought that there was still a

possibility

that there was a photograph of Oswald?

A: Indeed. As I recall, we tried to get that

photograph to

headquarters as fast as we

could.

As it

turned out it wasn't neces-

sary to send it. But Eat was our intention. 6601

The photograph was sent to Dallas where Special Agent.

Odum of the FBI showed it to Mrs. Marguerite Oswald on

23 November 1963. 661/ Mrs. Oswald would later claim

it was a photograph of Jack Ruby, 662/ beginning a peried

of controversy and uncertainty about this photograph that

has continued to this day. The interaction of the Warren

Commission and the ClA on this: question is detailed

in another section of this resort. On 23 November Mexico

informed Headquarters that "at obvious photos sent to Dallas

were not iden with Lee Oswald." 663/ Since the time of

the assassination, this man has been identified as Yuriy

Ivanovich Moskalev, a Soviet ‹GB officer. The identifica-

several CIA officers in Mexico. 665/

B. Reporting of information concerning Lee Harvey

Oswald from the electronic intercept operation

aimed at the Soviet Embassy

The first cable that Mexico sent to Headquarters

after the

assassination referred Headquarters to the

cable traffic conferning Oswald that had occurred prior

to the assassination. 666/ Headquarters replied that

they had also noted the "cornection." 667!

The cable traffic on the day of the assassination,

and the early traffic from the following day, deal al-

most exclusively with the plotograph of the person who

later became known as the Mixico Mystery Man. . The

first cable 6681 obviously referred to the October 1

contact and brought it to Headquarters' attention by

referring Headquarters to M:XI 6453. The first cable

that specifically refers to the transcripts occurred

on the following day. Headquarters cabled Mexiço that

it was important that the station review all transcripts

on to instruct the station

to send the full transcripts and original tapes to Head-

if the original tapes are still available. 671/

that is the case then it merely shifts the question. This

may indicate that the CIA Headquarters was aware of the

inference is that they were aware of those visits at least

by the day after the assassination.

though witnesses generally denied

that there was telephone communication between Mexico

City and Headquarters at the time of the assassination,

there is strong evidence that there was such communica-

of the substantive Oswald conversations to Headquarters

by cable. Logically, one would expect that since the

circumstantial evidence indicates that these conversa-

tions

were linked to Oswald. prior to the assassination,

that they would all have been reported in one cable,.es-

pecially in light of the request from Headquarters in

DIR 84886. 675/ At this point, according to the files

and records made available to the HSCA staff by the ClA,

tape of the conversation on he Ist of October was re-

tion at that time, that possibility is highly unlikely. 6831

In view of what is now krown about the standard

operating procedures and about the Station's actions

prior to the assassination, the Station's confusing and.

somewhat contradictory reporting after the assassination

is strange. 684/ It is possible that these confusions

and contradictions arose out of the crisis atmosphere

at the station and the rush to report information. This

Committee has not found any solid evidence that there

were

sinister qualities in the reporting after the

assassination.

He was in Mexico City from 22 September to 1

This report will be referred to in some cases in this dis-

was simplified in order "not to risk losing

In addition to the tel phone surveillance main-

surveillance was not directed at the Soviet diplomatic

not to destroy

any of the Soviet tapes from this opera-

A note written by Ann Good-

pasture in 1963

seems to sonfirm Arehart's assumption

that the tapes were retained at the station.

(The Soviet tap operation) people just keep bring-

ing in the reels to me (the ones I give them are not

labeled so they don't necessarily know which ones

return.) The storage problem is one for us and as

the reels come in with transcriptions, I store them.

When we can erase them, I'll take off the labels

and send them back out.

Cuban tapes were retainer for thirty days because he

maintained them in the special rack: (Arehart Interview,

probably not correct insofar as the Cuban tapes are con-

a.M.o

the following call occured. • A woman named Silvia

named Guillermo Ruiz.

Ruiz tells her that he has

not

yet been

able to reach the consul and because of that

he has not called her.

Silvia tells him that "we"

have no time for that and

asks him for the consul's

phone number.: Ruiz respords by asking her not to get

annoyed and he wants to know if Silvia wishes to speak

to the Consul personally.

Silvia responds that she

does.

Ruiz says that the number is 11-28-47. Silvia

says that is fine and the conversation ends. (CIA

transcript from Cuban Embassy,

9/27/63.) It cannot be

determined whether this caller was indeed Silvia Duran or

if she subsequently callec the Consul since Duran's of-

fice phone was not tapped.. The tap was on the telephone

used by Ruiz.

the above detailed allegations, it is im

portant to distinguish between the allegation that a

photograph was found at headquarters as opposed to the

assertion that a photograph was found in Mexico City.

It is also important to remember that these allegations

are what can be termed "grapevine stores."

There was

a photograph found in Mexico City of a man that was

thought possibly to be Oswalc.

This photograph and

the circumstances surrounding it will be dealt with in

a subsequent section.

Ms. Arne Goodpasture of the

Mexico City Station found

this photograph. (See below.)

In the absence of any evidence otherwise Note: The

Watson

allegation says there was a photo in Mexico City in the

mid-60's; not that it was found there--it is most

likely that the grapevine strries about a photo being

found in Mexico arise from M::. Goodpasture's report-

ing

the photo of the man who has since become known as

the Mexico mystery man in the same cable that reported

Oswald's visit to the Soviet Embassy..

(see below.)

The findings of this Committe regarding the general

Mexico City surveillance operations are presented in

Section II, A and B above.

In summary i

this Committee

found that there were three photographic surveillance

bases (four cameras) that may have photographed Lee

Harvey Oswald in September and October of 1963.

This

was determined from analysis of.

project files for these

operations and the testimony of CIA officials.

wald's photo may have been sent to Headguarters.

This

examination also reveale no evidence that a photograph

of Oswald was sent to CIl. Headquarters.

This Committee

did find that there were several types of communications

between Headquarters

and field stations that were treated

as non-record material.

Because of the non-record nature

of these communications, it was not possible to review.

478/ If one assumes that Oswald could not speak any Spanish

then only two conclusions about the first three calls

of 9/27/63 are possible: 1) either these calls do not

pertain to Oswald, or 2) they do pertain to Oswald

but were made by someone other than Lee Harvey Oswald.

This second possible conclusion will be addressed in

a more detailed fashion in subsequent sections due to

its ramifications vis a vis Oswald's activities and pos-

sible associates as opposed to the substance of the in-

formation available to the CIA Station prior to the

assassination.

Investigation that may hare been in existence in 1963.

(Letter to Breckinridge, 1/20/78.)

The CIA responded

"that there are not now, or were there any, agreements

between the CIA and FBI: 0: other U.S. government agen-

cies concerning CIA respo sibility to report on contacts

of U.s. cutizens with Comnunist Embassies or officials...

The CIA under operative legislation has a counterintelli-

gence responsibility for counterintelligence cases

but it is notamatter of agreement with other agencies nor

does it concern simple contacts of Americans abroad with

Communist Embassies or officials." (Memorandum to

The connection of this photo-

graph to Oswald by including the description in the

cable that reported Oswald's contact. with the Soviet Em-

bassy has created more confusion and controversy: than

perhaps any other CIA related issue stemming from as-

sassination.

Consequently, this Committee has made an

attempt to determine the circumstances surrounding the

mistaken linkäge of this photograph to Oswald as well

as the consequences of that mistake.

"gave his name very slowly and distinctly."

(Foul. Foe

Manuscript, p. 267.) If Oswald used his middle name at

that time it would explain why Scott wrote "sic." by

"Henry."

But it should be noted that Oswald's name

does not come up in any of the transcripts made available

by the CIA until 10/1/63, and Oswald's middle name is

not given in that transcript. It is possible that

there is one additional transcript, possibly of the con-

versation that Scott, or page 267

of his manuscript,

refers

to as Oswald's "jirst contact,"which, if in exis-

this Committee that it is his belief that the tapes were

probably still in existence at the time of the assas-

sination. (HSCA Depositicn of John Scelso, 5/16/78,

tapes did not exist at the time of the assassination.

679/ HSCA staff have wondered wether or not the Mexico City

Station was entirely forthcoming of their own will

with Headquarters.

This speculation was based on three

pieces of information.

The first is the report in

MEXI 7024 that Headquarters had all the available in-

formation.

The second i: a note from Win Scott on the

Routing and Record Sheet for MEXI 7033 which says:

I had a call from Washington ( John Scelso) at

1620 hours on 23/xI.

I told John Scelso

at

1630 hours (our time) on 23/XI that this would

be on route to him.

The third is

a cable reporting that on the 23rd Win

Scott had an urgent call to see the President of

Mexico. The cable reports that Scott expected the

President to express his condolences over the assas-

sination but "developed hat (Mexican agent) had

located call to Soviet Elbassy of Lee Oswald

made on 28 September.

Bolieve fact that (President

of Mexico) aware of this contact (from our joint

operation)

da:a to COS is important."

(MEXI 7023, 11/23/63, paras. 2 and 3)

The Committee declines to speculate that the Mexico City

Station was possibly considering not reporting all

the information availabl:tothem. It was considered

that this may have been contemplated in order to pro-

tect themselves from a charge about their failure to

report the information prior to the assassination.

The discovery that the Mexicans were also aware of

the conversations would have made holding back the

transcripts perilous in that the Mexicans.could have

revealed their existence to the detriment of the

Station. Hence, the full report followed very shortly

after the meeting between the Mexican President and

Win Scott, and immediately after Scott discussed the

situation with his nominal superior in Washington

by telephone.

Scott's superior was asked about this.

He said that he did not remember the substance of

his telephone call to Wir Scott on the 23rd.

(HSCA

Deposition of John Scelsc, 5/16/78, p. 88)

"I do

not have any idea why (I called).

I may have been

ordered to call him on ary number of things." (Ibid..

p. 87.)

He was also asked about Scott's meeting

with the Mexican Presidert.

You get a psychological question. The Chief

•of Station is called in to speak to the Presi-

dent of Mexico.

There had been a big fight

when the new Ambassador got there--no, it wasn't

that.

It was a very peculiar situation in Mexi-

co whereby the Mexicar. President's primary con-

tact with the U.s. government was through our

Chief of Station rather than through the Ambas

sadors.

This caused 10 great problem with the

then-Ambassador whose name I have forgotten.

Q: Thomas Mann?

A: Yes.

He was a ver!' fine guy and recognized

the usefulness of this arrangement. The next

Ambassador, MI. Freeman, tried to cut Win

Scott out of contart with the President of

Mexico, whereupon the President of Mexico

called in Win Scoti: and said, "I want you to

send a cable to thr: White House telling them

I am not going to deal with

this jackass, I

want to deal only with you."

So, the result was. eventually, Winston

Scott and Ambassador. Freeman went to the

White House and talked to President Johnson

and straightened the whole thing out in favor

of Winston Scott.

agencies--FBI, CIA, Secret Service, etc. --were asked to.

investigate the assassinaticn.. When the Central Intelli

gence Agency's Mexico City itation remembered that Lee

Harvey Oswald had visited Mexico City during late Septem-

ber and early October, it reviewed the electronic surveil-

lance files and found eviderce of phone calls to the so-

viet Embassy made September 27th, September 28th, and

October Ist, that could have been made by Oswald. 685/

Review of the electroic surveillance files also produced

telephone calls on September 27, 1963. between the Russian

Consul and Silvia Duran, a secretary at the Cuban consu-

late, where Oswald was discussed. 686/ In addition,

the Mexico City Station found a September 28, 1963 phone

call from Silvia Duran to the Soviet Consulate where Silvia

Duran stated that there was an American citizen at the

cuban Consulate who had prevfously visited the Soviet con-

sulate. 587/ A final phone call was made on October i, 1963

that the assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald, she

ascertained that it was the same man who ap-

Lee Harvey Oswald Visited the Cuban Consulate three

times on September 27, 1963, not twice as the Warren Com-

mission previously reported. 712/ Oswald first visited

the Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m., requesting

an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final destina-

tion. 713/ He showed her some documents, then

left to

obtain photographs needed for his application. 714/

Oswald returned at approximately 1:00 p.m. with

four photographs. 715/ Ms. Tirado typed the application

Oswald showed her documents he had brought: his Russian

labor card, marriage certificate with the name of his

Russian wife, his American Communist Party membership card

and his "Fair Play for Cuba' membership card. 1171

Ms. Tirado found Lee Marvey Oswald's behavior suspi-

at the Cuban Consulate when he applied for a visa and

had dated him on several occasions. 143/ Duran admitted

that she had had intimate relations with Oswald, but in-

when the latter was in Mexico is

probably

new, but adds little to the Oswald case.

Second, the Mexican police did not report

the extent of the Duran-Oswald relationship

to this Station. 749/

In the chronology of the Mexico City investigation

of Oswald, Raymond Rocca notes: "Why didn't Mexico

police give us all info?" I50/. This was not the first

report of such a relationship between Oswald and Duran.

Elena. Garro had reported the same information to Charles

Thomas in 1965: 751/

That the Mexican government did not disclose all

the

information in its possession to American authorities

raises one of three possibilities:

1) the Mexican government did not want to disclose

that one of its citizens had had intimate rela-

tions with the assassin of John Kennedy; or

2) Silvia Duran was a Mexican penetration agent

in the Cuban Consulate and the Mexican govern-

ment. was protecting its informant by minimizing

her relationship with Oswald; or

3) they forgot, i.e., a pure and simple mistake.

Intelligence

Since the publication of the Warren Commission

Report in September 1964, critics have written about the

possibility that silvia Duran was an intelligence agent

for either the Americans, Mexicans or Cubans.

1) Was Silvia Duran in agent, asset or source

for Mexican or American intelligence?

In an effort to resolve this question, the House

Select Committee on Assassinations reviewed the United

States investigative agencies' files on Silvia Duran. 752/

The Committee found no evidence in this file review that

Silvia Duran was either an American or Mexican Intelli

gence agent.

In addition, the Comnittee has interviewed most

of the Mexico City. Station imployees about the possibility.

Orly David Phillips, Chief of Covert Action and the Cuban

Section in che Mexico City itation in 1963, a position

which made hin very knowledleatie, considered that Duran

was possibly an agent or

source.

at the Cuban Embassy." 754/ Mr. Phillips stated that

he had first heard Duran's name from the telephone

intercept transcripts. 755/ But Mr. Phillips asserted

that the CIA had no interest in Ms. Duran because "she

wasn't friendly with anyone." 756/ Mr. Phillips had

previously mentioned the CIl Mexico City Station's in-

terest in recruiting a former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico

named Lechuga. 757/ Mr. Phillips was shown a memorandum

written by W. David Slawson of the Warren Commission staff

regarding a trip to Mexico sy Warren Commission staff

members which said:

Mr. Scott's (Chief of the CIA Station in Mexi-

co City) narrative disclosed that the ClA's

action immediately after the assassination con-

sisted basically of alerting all its confiden-

tial

sources of information

throughout Mexico

to immediately channel all information into

their headquarters,

and of compiling as.com-

plete dossiers as possible on Oswald and every-

one else throughout Mexico who at that time

the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald...

This meant especially Silvia Duran, who because

she had previously been having an affair with

Lechuda, the former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico

and presently the Cuban representative at the

United Nations, had previously been of substan-

tial interest to the ClA... 753/

that. "No one let me in

Mr. Phillips added that he doubted that Duran would

have been pitched because the Station could not identify

any of her weaknesses. The Committee staff members then

told Mr. Phillips about the reporting on file concerning

Ms. Duran from one of the Station's penetration agents,

LITAMIL/9, at the Cuban Embassy. At one point LITAMIL/9

had reported to his case officer that all that would

have to be done to recruit Ms. Duran was to get a blonde,

blue-eyed American in bed with her: 761/ With this, Mr.

Phillips said that it did indeed sound as if the Station

had targeted Ms. Duran for recruitment, that the Station's

interest had been substantial, and that the weaknesses

and means had been identified. 762/ Mr. Phillips

pointed out, however, that because Duran had been targeted

did not necessarily mean that she had been pitched. 763/

In addition, he stated that he had never heard that Duran

had been pitched. 764/

Mr. Phillips did state that he would expect that

Ms.. Duran's file at the ClA would be "very thick" because

of all the telephone intercepts that concerned her and

the substantial interest that the Station had in her. 765/

He stated that much of the naterial in her file should

predate the assassination. 765/ Mr. Phillips stated that

of 1975 dealing

stated that he believed that Ms. Duran may

the Mexicans. 171/ Mr. Neiscuir could not recall why he

(2) was Silvia Duran a Cuban intelligence agent?

the files that would indicate that Ms. Duran was associated

with Cuban intelligence.

In addition, the HSCA interviewed most of the Mexi

worked for Cuban intelligence. Only Barney Hidalgo, a

the possibility to be likely. 175/ Mr. Hidalgo, professing

the argument between Azcue ind the individual occurred

during this visit. 1088/

Ms. Duran stated tha: Oswald's third and last

visit occurred in the late ifternoon after. working hours

on the 27th. 1089/ This visit is confirmed by the CIA's

tap on the Soviet Consulate. 1090/

In addition to the a leged Oswald visits to the

Consulates, there were other telephonic contacts that may

have been between Oswald, or an imposter, and the consu-

lates. 1091/

Several deta'ls about Oswald's visits to

the Cuban Consulate, and telephonic contacts with both

Consulates suggest that the individual involved may not

have been Oswald..

Silvia Duran's description of Oswald did not

Azcue's description of Oswald was similar. to Silvia

Duran's, but more detailed. 1094/ Perhaps the most re-

markable thing about these descriptions is their simi-

Another possible incication that an imposter may

Soviet Consulate and

identified himself as "Lee Os-

wald." 1101/ This man also stated that he had been at

the Consulate on Saturday, the 28th. 1102/ The transla-

tor noted that this was the same man who had called the

Consulate "a day or so ago" and had spoken in broken

Russian. 1103/: From this information, and possibly a

voice comparison 1104/, the 9/28 caller was identified

Oswald. 1105/ The problem with assuming that the

caller on 9/28 and 10/1 was Oswald is that Oswald spoke

fluent Russian. 1106/ Gran:ed, Ms. Duran's denial.of

the Saturday visit and the proficiency of the caller's

Russian is not sufficient elidence to conclude that the

person who visited the Cuba, Consulate on Saturday and

who called the Soviet Consulate on Saturday and on Octo-

ber Ist was an imposter. Yut the information is suffi-

cient

to question the assumition that it was Oswald,

especially in light of Azcuu's and Duran's descriptions

and Elena Garro de Paz' allegation.

The Committee notes he possibility, but does not

conclude, that the missing production from the pulse

camera and the LILYRIC base has something to do with tha

possibilizy that someone impersonated Oswald in Mexico.

Three calls that also occurred early on September

27, 1963 may have been by al imposter: At approximately

10:30 a.m. a man called thè Soviet Military Attache

looking for a visa to Odessi and was referred to the So-

viet Consulate. 1108/ At 11:37 a.m. a man called the

Soviet Consulate and asked or a visa to Odessa. 1109/

He was told to call back at 11:00. 1110/ At 1:25 p.m.

a man called the Soviet Embussy and was told the Consul

would return between 4:00 pm.. and 5:00 p.m. that day.

While only the calle's requests for a visa to

Russia 1112/ (Odessa) conne:t these calls to Oswald,

the HSCA believes that they do fit logically into a time

sequence created by what is known from testimony and the

electronic intercepts about his actions on that day.

For example, the following is a reasonable possible

chronology of Oswald's actions on 9/27/63 based on analy-

sis of the available eviden:e. Oswald probably arrived

in Mexico around 10:00 a.m. on September 27. 1113/ By

10:30 Oswald had time to arrive at the Hotel del Comercio

and to place a cail to the soviet Military attache ano

referred him to the Consul. 17144. The military atcache

also gave the cailer directions to the Consuiate. 1l151

possibility cannot be dismissed.

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in

Mexico City?

When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey

Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

The Commission undertook an intensive investi-

gation to determine Oswald's purpose and acti-

vitres on this journey, with specific reference

to reports that Oswald was an agent of the Cuba.

or Soviet Governments.. As a result of its investi-

gation, the Commission believes that it has been

able to reconstruct and explain most of Oswald's

actions during this time.

By Saturday, September 23, 1963, Lee Harvey

Oswald nad

failed to obtain

visas as boti

the Cuban and Soviet Embassies.

From Sunday,

Subsequent to the Warren Commission's Report,

the allegations of Elena Garro 1132/ and Oscar Contreras

Lartigue 1133/ came to the attention of the United

States investigative agencies. The main allegation of

both these people, that they met Lee Harvey Oswald

in Mexico City, remains to this day without direct corro-

boration. Yet the Committee feels that it cannot dis-

miss these allegations without giving them any considera-

tion.

It is entirely possible that Oswald did spend some of

his time during this weekend sightseeing and making

his travel arrangements. It is also entirely possible

that, after his failure to obtain his visas on Saturday,

September 28, that Oswald did not give up completely

and did attend a party where he would have come into

contact with

the Cuban Consular officials and, later,

sought help from pro-Castro students.

It is entirely possible that Ruben Duran had a

"twist party" on September 30, or October 1 1138/ as

Elena Garro has'

claimed. Ruben, Horacio, Lydia and Silvia

Duran all admitted that they frequently had twist par-

whether or not guards were posted outside of Elena's

Oswald's relationship with Silvia Duran was more exten-

this point but denied that she had had an affair with

This denial is not consistent with evidence of her reputa-

Elena Garro had created a cisturbance at the Cuban Embassy

her allegations were handled in an irresponsible manner

Appendix 5: Biography: Elena Garro De Paz

Elena Garro de Paz wis born of Spanish parents in

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917. (Al1 information in

this section culled from Biography Data form prepared by

Charles Thomas.) Ms. Garr, attended the National Autonomous

University of Mexico and liter did graduate work at Berkley

in California and at the University of Paris. In 1963,

Elena had long been marries to Octavio Paz, a career

diplomat who is also one of Mexico's finest poets and leading

intellectuals. When Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador

to India, the couple separated by mutual consent. Elena's

daughter, also named Elena, has always resided with her

mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life

in Europe she had a ratner un-Mexican objectivity about her

native land and had a reputation for being one of its more

articulate detractors.

At the same time, Elena was considered

emotionally committed to many aspects of Mexican life and

made an

important contributior to its artistic deveiooment

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las Romas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.

Ms. Garro's short stories re collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porenir,. "a

splendid success." Critic: have said of her: "For Elena

Garro, there is no frontie: between reality and fantasy;

in any case, the latter is a second reality--perhaps more

intense--to which one may penetrate without passport or

forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of a literature

fired with passion, flavor and life.". Many people who

knew Elena have asserted that the frontier between reality

and fantasy is also difficult for her to distinguish in

real life. (Biography Cata Form on Elena Garra de Paza

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sinse of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tenled on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her importait social, literacy, and political

connections rendered her fairly immune from serious cunter-

country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.
