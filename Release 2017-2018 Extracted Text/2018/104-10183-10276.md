V11. Evaluation

PrOm AMIUG-I's assessment of Subject, basod on personal

knowledge and observation, it sould appear that Subject

would not be a too difficult target to hit. However,

some of his personal characteristics which bave made him

& handling problen for the DGI sould presumably sake hia

a handling problea for us.

His failure to perfor for

the DOI since October 1903 might mitigato against our

use of bin which would inclute, presumably, resumption of

als s/y channel.

Nonetheless, ALlUG-l's clala that Subject

is a maber of the Central Committee of the POLS (nevs to

us) makes his an operutional target for that reason slone.
