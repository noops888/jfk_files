Interview:

On May 8, 1978 Clarence Day and I (Surell Brady).

interviewed Larry Huff at his home.

Present also during the

interview was Huff's wife, Gloria Deane Huff.

Huff stated that he served in the U.S. Marine Corps

from 1949 to 1970. In 1963 he was stationed at Camp Smith in

Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. He was assigned as a navigator.

Soon

after the assassination of President Kennedy, Huff says he

received orders to fly a group of CID investigators to Atsugi,

Japan to investigate Lee Harvey Oswald. Huff' says all orders

were received from the office of Lt. Gen. Carson A. Roberts at

Camp Smith. Huff says that except in emergency situations the

orders from Roberts' office were written, and he believed these

flight orders were also written. (He explained that the orders

originated from Roberts' office, but that Roberts did not partici

pate in the actual flight. He also surmised that the original

orders for such an investigation came from Washington.) Roberts

command was of the First Marine Brigade for the Pacific Fleet

Interview: Larry Huff

Huff stated that he left Hawaii on the ordered flight

on 12/14/63. He said there were approximately 12 investigators

present on the flight. They landed at Tagikawa, just outside

Atsugi. Huff stated that was the nearest available landing

place. Huff said he did not know the names of any of the

investigators and he did not usually fly with them. He could

not remember exactly who the other crew members were. However,

he stated that Chief Warrant Officer Morgan was pilot of the

plane.

He said the other crewmen he usually flew with were

Roy Gibson, a navigator (he was later transferred to Area Intercept

Operations), Ralph K. Fall, a radioman (he was junior to Huff.

and still there when Huff left), a man named Hall who was assigned

radioman (Huff cannot remember his first name), and a

sergeant named Edwards (first name not recalled). Huff said

that the chief mechanic at the base in Hawaii was Tom Allen

(wife Dorothy), present address 2661 D Orange. Avenue, Costa

Mesa, California, phone (714) 646-1066. Huff stated that no

Naval Intelligence personnel were present on the flight.

He identifies the plane.as a C-54, serial number 50855.

He stated that the plane on the return flight was a VC 54-P,

serial number 90392. He said the latter plane was the "personal"

plane of Lt. Gen. Roberts; the other plane was also normally

used by his crew on transport work for Roberts' outfit.

Huff said that after leaving the investigators in Japan

he returned to Camp Smith, Hawaii on 12/22/63, leaving the

team at Atsugi.

Huff said that at the time of the assassination he

was at El Toro Marine Base in California.

on 11/23/63 he

talked with a fellow navigator at El Toro, George Moffitt,

who said he had been ordered to take a crew to Dallas to

investigate the assassination there.

Huff believes Moffitt's

group left for Dallas on that same day 11/23/63 or on 12/7/63.

Huff said he is sure Moffitt's team actually went to Dallas;

Moffitt may not have gone along, but he was responsible for

arranging the navigators for the flight. He said Moffitt is

retired and lives presently at 2530 South Cowell, Santa Ana,

California, phone (714) 545-8830.

Huff returned to Japan to pick the team of investigators

up on

1/31/64. He said he knew that they were investigating

Oswald the entire time they were in Japan. On that return

flight Captain Cruse was pilot of the plane. Huff said that

on the return flight the investigators allowed him to see the

report they had prepared. He said it was typewritten in final

form and consisted of about 20 pages. He said he looked it

over for about 30 minutes. He said it was classified "For

Marine Corps Eyes Only". Huff said he had been granted a Top

Secret clearance previously. Huff said that the report seemed

to consist of interviews of persons; he recalled the conclusion

to be that Oswald was not capable of committing the assassination.

Huff said it was known openly among the crew that the

purpose of the flight was to investigate Lee Harvey Oswald

after the assassination. He said he doesn't know why the

report was

never made known during an investigation of the

assassination. He said he was under no restriction or secrecy

agreement about the investigation other than his security

clearance.

He has never heard the report mentioned since.

(Mrs. Huff volunteered that when she was living in

Fontana, California at the time of the assassination, and

before she married Huff, she read an article about the series

of investigations that were taking place, and she thought the

article mentioned that the Marine Corps had also undertaken

its own investigation. She believed she saw the article in a

San

Bernadino, California newspaper.)

Huff said the military would have records of the flights

of the planes involved. He stated master logs are maintained

of all military aircraft by the Chief of Naval Operations. In

Washington those records would be kept by the Pentagon Air Arm.

Huff said that his work at the time normally consisted

of transporting military teams throughout the Far East. He had

received a secret clearance and most of his work was classified

(He stated that transport movements were normally always classified.)

Huff said that after Roberts left in about Dec. 1963 he continued

as navigator under Gen. Kulak.

Huff stated that he was stationed at Iwakuni in Japan

in 1958. He said a lot of classified work went on at Iwakuni.

He believes there was only one outfit at Iwakuni which was

not engaged in classified work. He said he was aware that

U-2 work was going on at Atsugi. That work was supposedly

classified, but only the east side of the base at Atsugi was

classified and off-limits to people who didn't have secret

clearance. Huff stated he was at El Toro in California when

"Gary Powers' plane was shot down. He does not remember any

talk about how the soviets got enough information to shoot

the U-2 down. Huff recalls.: that most of the military conversa-

tion was about why Powers didn't commit suicide as they believed

he had been instructed to do in case he was captured.

Huff said that he and his crews were provided with false

passports in case they were shot down or captured. Some of the

biographic data in the passports they were issued was deliberately

false.

Huff stated that it was his impression that Oswald would

not necessarily have had to have a top secret clearance to work

at Atsugi even though the U-2 was housed there.

Huff entered the military on 8/11/49. He retired with

an honorable discharge on 7/1/70; at the time of his retirement

he had the rank of Master Sargeant E-8.
