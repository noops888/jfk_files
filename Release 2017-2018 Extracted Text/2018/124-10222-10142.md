Rdce Obreros Revélucionario Cubanos (FORC, Front of Revolutionary
y ‘Cuban Workers)! claimed that the following exile groups were
pgconniving to take action against Cuba within the next few months:
Bethe Junta Revolucionaria Cubana (JURE, .Cuban jolutionary Junta);
the Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for
@KRevolutionary Recovery) ; theYEjercito, Rebeldé Chit Rebel Army) ;
and the "Alliance" of the Movimiento Revolucionario Popular (MRP,
ionary Movement), the Segundo Frente Nacional del
, Second National Front of the Escambray, and

JURE, the ER, and the "Alliance" were planning to enter Cuba to_
prepare the groundwork for internal insurrection, while the MRR
was to carry .out diversionary hit-and-run attacks on the Cuban‘
coasts. Meanwhile, the FORC was building up its own clandestine
organizatio:
sabotage and ow-downs in Cuban industries, thus paving the ‘way
for an eventual general strike. FORC claims to have the support
of the Confederacion de Trabajadores Venezolanos (CTY, Venezuelan
Workers’ Co eratio and of the Confederacion Lat_.oamericana
