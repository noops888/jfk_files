BURKE advised that he knew very little concerning
the background of subject and only knows that he was a gangster
and hoodlum because he was so informed by JOHN TEETER,
the husband of CHRISTINE MC GUIRE. During his association
with the subject, BURKE claimed that he never ‘met any of
his associates and never learned anything about his activities. W

BURKE further related that generally subject attempts
to appear as a legitimate businessman and no type of
illegitimate .activity was ever disclosed. wy

About Christmas, 1960, BURKE said he recalled

that GIANCANA was in New York City and that on one
occasions he chauffeured him while he went shopping,

| however, he advised he did not know the exact places he

i went inammuch as subject wo if get out of the car at a

y particular intersection and, nfermed BURKE to wait there
until he returned. Because of traffic conditions he would
have to drive around the block and usually the subject. would
be waiting for him. On this particular shppping tour, BURKE
has no knowledge of any specific item which subject purchased
either for himself or for PHYLLIS MC GUIRE.

Recently according to BURKE, subject gave PHYLLIS
a new 1961 Cadillac White Convertible. He Added that he
has no direct knowledge of this but that it was heresay
information most likely, He said,he heard this either
from PHYLLIS' sisters or their husbands. \\

BURKE advised that in a general way he is familiar
with PHYLESS' jewelry collection and as far as he knows.
“subject only gave her a very expensive set of earrings
or necklace. Again he claimed that he was not able to
determine the value of any particular pieces jewelry
but heard that the gift was expensive either from the
sisters or their husbands,

BURKE never knew subject in the past year to
have given PHYLLIS any kind of a mink or fur coat. He
added that he knows the sisters have identical fur pieces.\

While in New York City BURKE advised that subject
has stayed overnight in PHYLLIS' apartment andthe only
other place he stayed to his knowledge while In New York
City was at the Hotel Plaza. However, he added he has no
knowledge whether subject used his true name or an alias
while registered at this Hotel. (\

: BURKE said that while in conversation with the
subject in December, 1960, subject mentioned that he
Yad been in Miami. He claimed he never knows subject's
definite plans for travel but was of the opinion that. he
returned to Chicago each time after leaving the various
cities. \ - ci !

On Sunday, 7/23/61, BURKE advised that he went
to the Seaside Hotel, Atlantic City, New Jersey, in order
to drive the station wagon back to New York City. As far
as he knew PHYLLIS was going to drive her new car, however,
he doubts that PHYLLIS would drive this distance and
even though he does not have definite knowledge, he is of
the opinion that subject drove PHYLLIS back to New York
City and most likely is still in the city. In the event,
subject 1s in New York City BURKE is of the opinion
that he will be either staying at PHYLLIS! apartment or
at the Plaza Hotel. He added that “most likely he will be
in contact with PHYLLIS and that he will attempt to '
discreetly aseertain subject's current whereabouts.\)

said he has been very expensively dressed and he recalls
he wears very expensive shoes,however, he has never seen

said that the McGuire Sisters when they go out together in
New York City will visit the Waldorf Room, Basin Street East,
Little Club, Hotel Plaza, Ghambotg, Four Seasons, and the
Forum of the Seven Caesers.: Formerly they also frequently
visited the King Henry V Restaurant but because of an
dineident there in the recent past, they do not go there
anymore. According to BURKE, CHRISTINE and DOROTHY MC GUIRE
also go to the theater but PHYLLIS does not go inasmuch as
she does not like the theater shows. W

Sea BURKE advised that PHYLLIS will be going to

Hass. in the near future but as yet he does notimow the exact .
date, He added that he believes the sisters' next show

Will be on the Ed Sullivan Program and that immediately
afterward they will leave for an engagement in London. Ww

with the McGuire Sisters, In viewof this, a PCI case
will be opened in the, New York Office. He added that he
will cooperate in every way possible with the. FBI and
positively will not inform PHYLLIS or any members of her
family that he has been contacted by the FBI. W

During the late part of the afternoon on.7/25/61,
BURKE telephonically advised SA-DURKIN that. he had just
received a phone call from PHYLLIS who informed him to drive
her car to her residence. He said that most likely she
wanted him to do something and that the car was not for
her personal use. \\

wanted him to fix her air conditioner in her apartment and
