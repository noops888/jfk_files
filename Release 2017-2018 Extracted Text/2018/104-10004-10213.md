MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT. : Discussion with Warren Commission Stalf Member

REFERENCE: Letter from J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the

President's Commission, to Mr. Richard Helme

dased 3 July 1964

wilh thE Aproval o C/SR and the DDP, I met with Mr. W.

David Slawson of lie staff of the President's Commission on the

Assassination of President Kennedy at 1400 hoars on sis date in

the Commission"s offices at 200 Maryland Aveque, N.E., Washington,

D.C. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies

in material provided the Commission by ClA and i, te Departmert of

State which were called to our attention in a lesteI from the General

Counsel of the Commission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964.

2. By way al introduction, Mr. Slawson said lhat in the portion of the

Commission's report that he was writing, he mould hare to deal with the

question of whetter or not the OSWALDs" departure from the USSR - and

the circumstances (i.e. timing) of that departare - sere unusual or

suspicious in any nay. He expressed his belief that ley probably sere

ot and cited Sornet relaxation in such matters in Le post- Stalin era

lowever, he marted tu be sure in his oun mird that our information wa

not in conflict sith that which the Commissior sad received from State

since all of that information would remain in lee records of the

Commission.

3. After stating my belief that there was to real disagreement or

inconsistency betseen the information from ClA and that from State, 1

expressed the vies that the matter resolved itself into three questions:

a. Do the Sovies authorities normally permit Soviet

cilizens married tu forcign nationals to emigrate from the

Soviet Union to the homelands of their spouses?

b.: Do they normally permit such Soviet cilizens to

accompany (i.e. depart simultaneously with) their spousea

from the Soviet Union?

c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get

Soviet exit visas ior such a purpose (time lapse from application

to granting of visas)?

1. Concerning the firet two questions (3à and 3b above) I printed out.

that we had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Sovie: citizens

being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only

with the larger question of Sovicts married to foreigners being allowed

to emigrate without reference to whether or not they left simultar usly

with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson commented

that this explanation was most helplul ard he rercad what both se and

State had said in that light.

5. By way of further explanation. I said that the statements in

pragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being

permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were bared on a

review of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans.. In only four of

chese cases did a Soviet wife leave he USSR in the company of her foreign

husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the

remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit is 80

categorize them. I added that although State's information began by

ciling the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the

American Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December

1963, it did not indicate how many of tbese visas were for Soviet citizens

who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed

information for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of ibese

whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreige spouse.

16. In response lo

6.

In response to a question from Mr. Slauson I stated that most

of the 26 cases upon shich ve based our slatements involved foreign

students, exchange leachers and other relalively transient persons.

and while a number of cares have certain points is common, they bear

little similarity to the OSWALD case in that nome imvolved a defector who

married prior to repatriating. I noted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April

1964 memorandum to tre Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson

indicated that hg was now satisfied on this matter.

Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to

process exit visas for Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals

(question 3c above), I stated that, in my opinion, the information

provided by State (in the third enclosure to MI. Meeker"s letter)

substantially corresponded to the viess expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7

of our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson

asked if it would be possible to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum

of 6 April by providing : statistical breakdoun of the cases on shich our

statements were based. I indicated that this could be done.

8. At this point M5, Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion

he felt that the question al possible inconsistencies had been resolved.

However, he asked that de send a brief written reply to the Commission's

letter of 3 july 1964 embodying the substance of what I had said concerning

the baris for statements included in pur 6 April 196% memorandum. (This

would include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed

to C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet

visa applications. ]

9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he iould be sending parts of his report

dealing with the Soviet intelligence services to CIA for checking as to

their accuracy. He did not say when this would occar.

10. After concluding the meeting with Mr. Slawsor, I read Volume 52

of the transcript of testimony before the Commission.

Tas included the

reinterview of Marina OSWALD.

See 201-234750 on Tenara S. KÜSGUOVA.

On his second trip to the USSR in Jamary 1959, Philip Robert

NIELSON

was given an INTURIST Interpreter/guide named

Tamara Stepenovna KUNGUiOVA, A ronance developed between them and NIELSON

became doterined to marry her, unich hé finally did in the spring of 1962.

Mis family did everything in their pover to discourage this romance and John

Hanes of the State Deptartment received letter froM HIELSON's father re

affair Not seeking help but advice on what to do.

NIELSON later received letter fron his father in fall 1960 giving in

details the contents of a conversation father had had uith John Hanes of State®

Koumoos cabotata

Henes stated that:

a All American-Soviet marriages had turned out to be unsuccessful.

b. The Soviets never let one of their netionals out of the country under

such circumstances unless the person had been recruited as a spy.

c.The Soviets will probably not given NIELSON a visa (he tried unauccess

fully all summer and fall 1960 and in 1961 to get Sor visa).

With regard to the marlage of a Soviet to a forelgner, fors

ACRSENKO(who werried a Britiah diplount in the 191010) has this

to say: "pat of the vonen who bave married foreignere must have agreed

at one time of another to carry out some cort of spy work for the Sovlote.

Otherise, they would not have been given permiation to marry foreigners,

" for even the marriage certificato has to be losued by the secret polloa."

Nora, herself, was recruited by State Security through coereion and orly

allosed to leave the country by agreeing to work for Sumint State Security.

Thia she sevor as heraune,

ince out of the country, she broke completely with

the Soviets ard it is presuned that she has furnished Information on

see.

that organization to the Brltish Servises. (*I Spled for Stalin, by

Nora Murray).

Petr DERYABIN, Stato Security officer who defected in 1954, has this

to say about the Soviet women who have contact with or who marry foreigners:

Sovlet woren associating with foreign men will be recrulted by State Security

when the association is first beguy, or after it has developed, or when plans

for marriage have been made. " Even if only 5% of these women are 100%

loyal State Security workers, and the others work leas loyally, lt 1s still

corsidered a worthwhile operation. No woran known to be antl-Sovlet would

ever be given a visa to leave the country, even 1f she were married to an

ambassador The Soviets Instruct all persons in this category to make rewarka

againat the Soviet Union when abroad, but these rerarks are not to be too strong,

nor are they made for publication"by press or radio."

In the carly 1960%s, when anyoung American was thinking of carrying an

INTURIST gulde, his father contacts a knowledgeable official of the State

Jepartment who made the following remarks:

lo All Arerican-Soviet marriages had turned out to be unsuccesful
