On 3/10/65, RUTH furnished information regarding the
student demonstration planned for later that day at the U. S.
Court House, Buffalo, the purpose of which was to protest the
treatment of Negroes in Selma, Alabama. RUTH advised that there
was no public advertising regarding the demonstration, but the
information was being passed by word of mouth. One student
remarked that he had already made up fifty posters for the
demonstration. Shortly after 12:00 noon, on 3/10/65, RUTH
advised telephonically that five SUNYAB students left the
rathskeller of Norton Union with placards destined for the
U. S. Court House.

On 3/11/65, RUTH stated that during the morning he
visited the student book shop located on Main Street across from
SUNYAB. He found on sale there "Workers World" and "Militant,"
but no copies of "Progressive Labor." A male employee in the
book shop in response to RUTH's question, said he knew of no
newspaper named "Free Student" (This is the organ of the May end
Movement ).
