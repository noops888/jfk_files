writer in Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/12/75 he had asked a question
as to how long after the assassination of King did the telephone
surveillance continue on the King residence. On 5/12/75 the

- weiter responded it was his recollection this: coverage continued
until a short time subsequent to the assassination. Following

continuation of the telephone surveillance from the former
residence to the latter one was not authorized. Secondly,

kitchen floor.

Q. Kitchen floor?

“A, Yes,

“Q. What surreptitious entry was made in respect to the King
residence or SCLC headquarters?

“A. During the period I was concerned with these cases there
vas none..

"a. Supposing an Agent wanted some item from either location

to use against King or SCLC, Would he not have made a surreptitious

entry to obtain it?

ta, No such entry was made at any time to my knowledge. I say
this very firmly because the Bureau policy before the late
1950s concerning such a technique had changed.

Yq. (By.Jack Smith) What do you mean by saying this policy

had changed?
“AL During my period with the Bureau, from the beginning, such
activity had to be approved by the Bureau, With reference to
the period of ent the policy had changed¥to the extent that
obtaining authority, was virtually impossible.

SCLC? i

‘a, To determine possible communist influence of King and SCLC.

hq. If, as you state, you did not develop information that King

.waS a communist, was not this investigation in vain?

“A. Not in my opinion. It is correct it did not establish that

King was a CP member. It did establish that he was in contact

with individuals then having past or present CP affiliation which

was the objective of the investigation, S<t /7*M HE of oh _

‘Q. Do you remember during 1963 King alleged that Bureau Agents

KAW ~King connections believed to have been involved in an earlier

‘

A. It is not my recollection.that they did.
“Q. What about a Klan organization?

‘A. I did at various times handle investigations concerning

individual Klan members. I“did not handle the Klan as an

Matter.

I feel compelled to apologize if I appear particularly
dense as to the utilization of this phrase COINTELPRO. If it
was.a program operating over a period of years the only explanation

“4h |
I can offer at this moment is that conceiably some field offices }
other than Atlanta were, lad therein. If this was the

case, Atlanta may well have been included therein subsequent

to my departure.

“Q. (John Bailey) When the telephone surveillance was discontinued
on the King residence and on SCLC who took care of that.

XA. Ido not know.

iA a Following a few very general concluding comments

wher _ by Seidel, the writer was given the opportunity to make a

understanding that the procedures of this Committee provided for

a witness to subsequently have opportunity to review the transcript
thereof, and that the writer would like to avail himself of
this opportunity. Inquiry was:made as to whether this could be

accomplished via registered or certified mailto preclude umnecessary

Concurrence to pass the 2/26/70 letter, with Secret

Leon F. Schwartz from Walter Elder, CIA on 6/10/75. The response

Bureau and this was based on the fact that no Agent would have
any reason whatsoever to make such a statement sinee we had

Towards the end of the article it reports that
MC KEVITT had received an official denial from "a Washington source"
;that any of the official agencies which have been named in
connection with the RIHA case actually had any knowledge of
where RIHA is now. , The source, according to the article which
MC KEVITT refused to identify, also said RIHA was not involved
in espionage of any sort and that none of these agencies
ave ever told anyone in Boulder, Denver, or elsewhere that
RIHA was alive and well.

The article points out the most frequently mentioned
agencies have been the FBI, CIA, Military Intelligence agencies
and the U. S. INS. -

Also enclosed is an article which appeared in the

On 2/10/70, SAC Werner, Denver, demanded that Mike

and that subject, in fact, was alright. Todorovich refused
to do so, The Director instructed that we protest to CIA ,

On 2-17-70, Liaison Agent Dapich vigorously protested
‘Todorovich's actions to CIA, charging the Agency with impeding
our inquiry. He pointed out that Todorovich's stubborn refusal
to divulge the identity of the Bureau Agent involved was unac~

‘attributed to our Agent. As a result of Papich’s protest, a
CIA official telephoned Todorovich and demanded that he divulge
the identity of the Agent. ‘todorovich refused and stated that
he considered this a matter of personal honor and that unless
' there was reason to believe Bureau operations were being
‘adversely effected, he would not make the identification, —-

The Honorable J. Edgar Hoover

i Dear Mr. Hoover: 7 iit ie

Mr. Papich has orally informed me that you wish to have the
identity of the FBI agent who was the source of certain information _
communicated to an employee of this Agency, Mr, Michael 1% orovich,
This information regarding the disappearance of one Thomas t Riha was ce
in turn passed to Dr. Joseph Smiley, then President of Col i
University, Boulder, Colorado, now President of a university in El
Paso, Texas, and to the District Attorney of Denver, Mr. James
McKevitt. In view of your personal interest in this matter, I instructed
Mr. Todoroyich to report to me in person. tN

7

Ihave reviewed this complicated case in detail with Mr. Todorovich
Sener and have requested him to reveal the identity of his source. As a point
a) of honor and personal integrity, Mr. Todorovich was adamant that he
q could not disclose the identity of his source, Under further pressure
“from me, Mr. Todorovich maintained his position, stating that in de-
| fense of it he was prepared to submit his resignation immediately.
| . .
Mr. Todorovich éxplained that the Riha/Galya Tannenbaum cases
had been given extensive news coverage, much of it being sensational
“in nature. He stressed that there was embarrassing public speculation
as to the possible involvement of the CIA and the FBI in Riha's
disappearance,

The purpose of Mr. Todorovich's conference with the District
Attorney of Denver was to solicit his good offices to remove pres-
sures and the possible serving of a subpoena on Dr. Joseph Smiley.
He also sought to orient the District Attorney properly so that he
would not continue to have an erroneous impression of the roles of
the CIA and the FBI, thereby eliminating further adverse publicity,

Mr. Todorovich affirms that before going to District Attorney
McKevitt he called upon the FBI Special Agent in Charge, Mr. Scott
Werner, and sought to coordinate with him our respective interests,
He also solicited Mr. Werner to accompany him to the District
Attorney.

Mr. Todorovich states that Mr. Werner refused absolutely to
cooperate in this matter. Instead, Mr. Werner engaged in an oral
exchange during which he remarked that our representative in
Boulder was "lying" and then proceeded to challenge the veracity of
Mx. Todorovich. Subsequently, Mr. Todorovich conferred with
the District Attorney alone. He was successful in persuading the
District Attorney to make a favorable public statement which had
the effect of putting this issue regarding Dr. Smiley and other rumors
to rest as far as the public was concerned.

Ihave carefully reviewed the statements of Mr. Todorovich,
I feel that poor judgment was employed in passing the information in
question to Dr. Smiley and later to the District Attorney. This should
only have been done with specific FBI approval. I wish to assure you
that I do not condone violations of the third agency rule, and 1am
taking steps to impress once again this elementary fact upon all Agency
officials.

While the following is not pertinent to your request, my review
of this case suggests the advisability of a re-examination of Riha's
disappearance and past activities and, necessarily, the Tannenbaum
case. Briefly, since 1958 we have commuricated to your Bureau
significant information which relates to Riha's involvement with
Czech and Soviet intelligence services, when he was behind the Iron
Curtain. Jattach for your information and convenience copies of
pertinent reports regarding this aspect of the case,

LIhope sincerely that this recent incident will not impair our
mutual efforts in making certain that we have not overlooked factors
possibly having a significant bearing on U.S, intelligence and internal
security interests, I shall pursue this matter through our respective
liaison offices,

In closing, Mr, Hoover, 1 I wish to si state that this s Agency can only,
fully perform its ad ties in the furtherance. “of the national security when
it has the closest coordination and teamwork with the Federal Bureau “Of

/ Investigation. Furthermore, it is necessary that we continue to con-

duct our business in an ‘atmosphere of mutual ‘Tespect. I trust that we
f can coordinate’ closely any future developments or actions in these cases,
in order to prevent the airing in public of conflicts or differences between
the two agencies. I feel strongly that there are representatives of the
news media who are eager to exploit alleged differences on a national
scale, Disturbing as this experience has been, I wish to thank you in
the interests of our common cause for having communicated with me

1, The January 1970 receipt of information from
your Bureau that Mrs, Ruth Ann COOK,. Thomas RIHA's
mother, had mention org of kr sonts work for CIA
in letters to the SAC, Denver, taaied us to verify the fact
RIHA has never been employed or used operationally by
this Agency.

2. In 1958 and 1959 you were provided information
that RIHA, when transitting Prague en route to Moscow,
was contacted by Czech Intelligence and asked to remain in
the CSR. Later in 1958 Czech Intelligence introduced RIHA
to the KGB in Moscow and our source reported RIHA accepted
certain privileges from the KGB while asserting he would not
become a spy for the Soviets. Details reported by our source
about RIHA's KGB contacts did not emerge during a 1960 FBI
interview of RIHA. J

3, This indication that RIHA may not have been truthful i
in 1960, when added to our current knowledge about KGB interest
in recruiting American exchange students and RIHA's 1968 ¢ rip

-to the USSR, suggests the circumstances of RIHA'S: ‘disappearance

might be re-evaluated. This Agency is reopening its file on this
case in view of the information disclosed in the attachments.

SUBJECT : RIHA, Thomas

1. The following report concerning an attempt by a
member of Czech Intelligence to effect the repatriation of
Subject, a naturalized American East-West Exchange student,
to his country of origin was recently submitted by a source -
of this office. ae

2. Source first became acquainted with Subject during: naaee
the past year at The Russian Research Center, Harvard University.
On 10 September 1958 he ran into Subject by chance at the SAS
office in Vienna as the two boarded a SAS flight to Copenhagen
5 via Duesseldorf. During the trip Subject disclosed the
4 following to source which has been supplemented from
information from our files.

3. RIHA, who was born in Prague, Czechosiovakia
17 April 1929, is one of the twenty American students
selected for the East-West Exchange Program and will be
studying in the USSR for the 1958-59 academic year. Files
in this Agency indicate that RIHA arrived in the U. ot on
‘15 July 1947 and became a citizen in 1952.

: 4. Our source informed UL that-RINA-HEE-BORS- ES Prague,
7 June of this year, to see his father and other relatives. His
father and mother are divorced and according to information
7 in our files, his mother is listed as Mrs. Ruth A,-COOK.
i address: 2023 Etna Street, Berkeley ey california
: : connie amen TN en aR :
5. RIHA told owr source that when he arrived in Prague
he was put into a Government hotel for three days before he
was allowed to stay with his relatives and friends. During
this time, and perhaps later, RIHA was accompanied through
the city by a guide whom he described as a "Government
Official" name unknown, who attempted to effect Subject's
repatriation to Czechoslovakia. RIHA told our source that
this man has set up an appointment (date and address unknown)
to meet him in Moscow to taik further. :

6. Subject told our source that this "Government
| Official" did not mention Czech Intelligence or Security
' Forces as such and that he (RIHA) is. not too worried
concerning this contact. RIHA apparently feels that it
is the price he must pay in order to study in the Soviet
Union and once he gets deeply into his studies in Moscow

“~"~~he feels that he can plead that he is too busy with his

academic work to have contact with any officials. Our

source also stated that RIHA is in some kind of correspondence
with the Czech official. We have no description or name for
the Czech official.

1. Reference is made to our CS CI 3/751,690 of

Intelligence to effect Subject's repatriation while the
latter was in Prague in June of 1958 visiting relatives
en route to study in Moscow during 1958-59 as an East-West
Exchange Student. The following report describes further
action taken by the KGB in Moscow to cuitivate Subject, and
was recently submitted by a sensitive and reliable source.

2. Sometime in December 1958, Subject again met the
Creech Official wlio had ivied to have Subject repatriate to
the CSR in Prague last summer. According to our source, it
was apparently an accidental meeting at a Moscow railroad
station as the Czech was returning to Prague. The Czech was
delighted to see Subject, and introduced him to a Soviet
official. This Soviet identified himself only by a first
name and a telephone number, both unknown to our source,

The Soviet described his work as being in the American
Section of the MVD.

3. This Soviet Official has been cultivating Subject
(trying to see him as often as possible, sometimes twice a
week) since their introduction in December, by offering such
blandishments as trips in a chauffered private limousine
into forbidden areas outside Moscow, tickets to any enter-
tainment, access to material from previously inaccessible
archives, the use of private country villas and all the
"beautiful, interesting and intelligent girls" he might want.
Subject has further “been promised the opportunity of returning
to the Soviet Union for as long as he wants at any future
date. He would have to pay only his way over there; his
expenses and return trip to the US would be paid by the
Soviets.

4. Subject has taken: advantage of this offer to take
several trips for sightseeing into forbidden areas around
Moscow in a private car with the Soviet Official, and has
also taken up a few offers for entertainment. Subject visited
one of these villas, but refused the girls on the ground that
he wants a woman to like him for himself, and not because she
has been told to do so. The Soviet answered that "some of
them will really learn to like you for yourself, as well as
work for us," but Subject still declined to get involved.
However, Subject has recently been taken up by a Soviet girl
who had previously tried to seduce another American student
and subsequently blurted out that she was put onto the latter
American by the MVD, which she has also told Subject. Subject
is reported to be responding warmly to her approaches although
he has flatly told her he doesn't trust her nor any Russian
completely. He claims he enjoys her company but will not
have a serious affair with her, and suspects she may be tied
up with the other women offered him by the Soviet Official.

5. In his reiationsiip with the Soviet Official, o
is reportedly aware that he is playing a risky game, and is
only utilizing the situation for the comfort and convenience
it brings him. He has told the Soviet frankly that he cannot
be wom over ideologically. Subject says he feels that the
Soviets' interest in him is to cultivate him as a scholar of
possible future importance to insure that he will always be
sympathetic to the Soviet Union. Subject has reportedly told
several other American students of his relationship with the
Soviet Official in order to cover himself "in case anything
happened",

6. This Soviet Official has evinced an interest to
Subject in many of the American Exchange students, with the
explanation that some would undoubtedly be back in Moscow
within two years as Diplomats and that since this is his
area of responsibility, he wants to know as much as possible
about them. The Soviet indicated that he was quite aware of
the pattern of the American Exchange students' trips to the
US Embassy and what they do in the university buildings, but
is not so sure of their activities around the city. To
demonstrate to Subject his knowledge about the American
students, the Soviet Official mentioned an affair going on
within the American group of which Subject had been unaware.
The Soviet's information turned out to be true.

_HW 55020 DocId:32989606 Page 69 Ht



7. Subject was described by a reliable source, who
knows him from group social gatherings at Harvard, as mature
and socially vivacious with a warm personality. Subject is
a clever and humorous conversationalist who likes to be
surrounded by people, make new acquaintances, and develop
friendships. Subject's patriotic motivation was not known
to our source, but the latter felt that Subject was completely
“Americanized" in manners and interests. Our source wouid
guess that Subject has courage.

8. It is requested that no further dissemination be
made of this information without prior clearance from this
office. It is further requested that such clearance be
obtained if Subject is to be contacted by you either before
or after his return to the United States.

SUBJECT: RIHA, Thomas .

1. Reference is made to our CSCI 3/751,690 of 27 October
1958, and our CSCI 3/754,303 of 14 April 1959 in which are re-
ported the attempt by Czech Intelligence to induce Subject, a
Czech-born naturalized American, to repatriate to Czechoslovakia,
and the further cultivation of Subject by the KGB in Moscow
where Subject is an Exchange Student during 1958-59. The
following report describes further action by the KGB to recruit
Subject, and his adamant refusal of any such offer. This latest
information was recently received from RIHA by a sensitive
and reliable source. a :

2. During April 1959, the Soviet Ofticiar-who-said- he——
was from the American Section of the MVD (sic) and who had been
cultivating Subject, allegedly asked the~lattér to make complete
and regular reports on Michael Martin*LUIHER,“one of the other
American Exchange Students at Moscow‘University. Subject was
asked to spend as much time as possible with LUTHER, and to
report where he goes, what he does and with whom he associates.
If Subject were to do this reporting, the Soviet Official
said he would make available certain material from Archives
which Subject has been unable to get permission to use although
research in this material is vital to his having a successful
year academically in Moscow.

3. Subject alleges he flatly refused this "deal", saying
that if he ever got mixed up in such a dirty business, it would
be for his own side and not for the Communists. The Soviet
Official then told Subject he should engage in such observation
and reporting to the Soviets to lose some ‘naivete" about how
the United States is exploiting the Cultural Exchange Program
for intelligence purposes. To back up this assertion, the |
Soviet Official told Subject about a "spy nest where spies deposit. |
things for one another" which he said had recently been uncovered
near a university entrance frequented by still another American
student, Walte EMENS, who, the Soviet implied, was not engaged
in academic work only while studying at Moscow University.



Subject reportedly again adamantly refused to cooperate with
the Soviet Official. ee ae ie

has now reportedly been alienated by-her-widependable personality :

left, or soon be leaving, for Prague to join her husband.

MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING

A PEBERESSESEEEPS

At 4:35 p.m., today I telephonically contacted ASAC
Morley, Denver, and advised him that an article concerning the
Riha case had appeared in the Sunday News (New York) 4-3~70.
This article was a general rehashing of the Riha case.

I told him that the Bureau desired that SAC Werner
contact the District Attorney to determine the developments
of his investigation in this case and also determine what |.
conclusions had been reached. Morley said this would be done. |

Morley was asked if Detiver: had information concerning
a professor who had gone to El Paso, Texas, or New Orleans,
Louisiana, and he advised this probably referred to
Dr. Joseph Smiley, former President at Colorado University
who was there when Riha disappeared. He said that Smiley
is now President of the University of Texas, at El Paso, Texas.
He said Denver had no information that Dr. Smiley has any
current information concerning this matter.

: SAC Werner called at 5:30 p.m., today to advise-
that he had been unable to get in touch with the District
Attorney but also was following up on this and would contact
the District Attorney today and get in a teletype tonight.

SUBJECT: THOMAS RIHA

MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING i 7

Pursuant to Director's request Denver District Attorney

James "Mike" McKevitt interviewed 5/5/70 as to investigation of
Riha, Czechoslovak-born, naturalized, former professor of Russian
history at Colorado University, who departed Denver area 3/69
without notifying friends, associates or estranged wife. His
disappearance has been glamorized and spiced up in newspaper
articles by references to Galya Tannenbaum, his paramour. NcKevitt
stated investigation at standstill, all leads being exhausted. He
i \ feels Tannenbaum may have killed subject since bad feeling developed
| between them prior to his disappearance due to her forging checks

on his account. Further, Tannenbaum probably a nymphomaniac who
had constant sexual affairs with Riha and used this as a club over
his head to prevent disclosure of forgeries. In MeKevitt's opinion
Riha is dead since he was close to his friends and if alive would

| conta act them. Investigation indicates Riha abnormal in his sexual
ideSives aid Could not leave women alons., Pessibility exists one f

of these involvements may have resulted in his death,

Dr, Joseph Smiley, former President, Colorado University,
}where subject, "einpLoyed, is now President, University of Texas,
{EL Paso, Texas. Smiley after subject's disappearance stated subject
was alive andvell. When challenged by MeKevitt to disclose basis
\eor statement he refused and appealed to CIA, his source, for help.
Bureau vigorously refuted CIA's claim that Bureau Agent was original
tsource for statement. _ As result McKevitt publicly announced
statement was not true and resulted from "honest mistake." No
indication Smiley has any facts to contribute concerning subject's
tcurrent whereabouts or basis for “his disappearance. Since
er conducted no investigation into Riha's disappearance, ice, interview
y

‘of ‘Smiley could result in impression Bureau entering case. However,
if Director so desires, El Paso will be instructed to interview
Wr. Smiley. Bureau files show subject attended Moscow University

IN THE STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING

_ OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL INPELLIGENCE AGENCY:

.he contacted a source in the CIA Office at Denver since

» possess, SMILEY was aware that the CIA had interviewed
RIJA following a trip by RIJA to the Soviet Union. The

was to state nothing and that he would be recontacted,

After leaving Boulder, SMILEY was advised by
Dean WILLIAU E, BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences,
University of Colorado, Boulder, that a letter was
received by the University purportedly written by RIJA
in which he stated that he would not be returning to
the University. BRIGGS advised SUNILEY that in his
opinion, the letter was a forgery, since the signature
did not compare with that of RIJA, :

-After the disappearance, SMILEY began, receiving
a@ great many inquiries from the news media and he was
pressed for a statement regarding his knowledge of RIJA
and whether or not he was alive.

THE FOLLOWING WAS FURNISHED BY DR, SMILEY

THAT JT WAS FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE FBI AND NO?
FOR DISSEMINATION TO ANY OUTSIDZ AGENCY SINCE HE WAS
BREAKING A CONFIDENCE WITH AN ASSOCIATE IN THE DENYER

Being hounded by the press for a statement,

he, SMILEY, was formerly a member of the Office of Naval
Intelligence, thinking that perhaps that agency could
assist him off the record with any information it might

CIA source subsequently told Dr. SMILEY to merely advise -
the press that he had information to the effect that

RIJA was “alive and well". This information was subsequently
released by Dr, SHNILEY to the student press at the University
of Colorado, and it appeared in print.

: When the Office of: the District Attorney in
Denver instituted investigation into the disappearance
of RIJA, SMILEY was contacted by the DA's Office regarding

the source of his statenent, Dr, SMILEY again contacted
the Denver CIA Office source and was advised that he

Sone days later, the CIA sovrce recontacted
him and told hin that he would be receiving an inquiry -
.from the Office of the DA in the forn of a statereont,
and that he should agree With ‘the statement even thouga
4t “was not quite the truth", SMILEY did not question


these instructions, since he felt that CIA knew what
should be done ia this type of case. He received a
+ telephone call from the DA's Office and a statement
was read to him to the effect that the information
: which he had received and made public to the effect
i. that RIJA was alive and well was in error. SHILEY
i. told the caller that he agreed with the statement and
nothing further came of this.

Dr, SMILEY does not know what part, if any,
“~~~-the CIA has in’ this case, but since ho, SMILEY, is
himself a former intelligence agent he did not feel
that he had the right to question something which
might be of vital importance to his country. —

‘ DR, SUILEY REQUESTED THAT NO HINT’ OR
“INFERENCE BE GIVEN TO THE CIA WHICH WOULD INDICATE
‘THAT HE HAS REVEALED TO THE FBI HIS CONTACTS REGARDING
THIS MATTER WITH THE DENVER OFFICE OF THE CIA.

He stated that though he has no evidence to
substantiate his belief, he cannot get it out of his
mind that RIJA may have been a double agent for the
Boviuts or the Czccheslovaks. He is aware that one
rs; TANNENBAUM, a wonan indicted for a number of frauds
and a suspect in two arsenic poisonings, is considered

iaaeeet @ suspect in the disappearance of RIJA, He never knew
RIJA to be associated with any such woman, but stated
that he was not acquainted with the personal life of
RIJA who was sonewhat of a "loner",

.  RIJA, when he joined the staff of the University
of Colorado, was single but in 8/68, an individual came
to visit RIJA ostensibly for the purpose of arranging
@ marriage between RIJA and the man's sister, The
intended bride was a Czechoslovakian girl who was born in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, and this "brother~in-law" was

- entertained by a member and colleague of RIJA in the
History Departrent. This individual indicated to SMILEY
that although the “brother-in-law” supposadly did not
speak any English, and had RIJA translate every statement ]
into Czech, it was apparent from the gestures anc ex epres ssilons |
of the "pro ther-in- law" that he understood more than he |

: let on. ree weeks after the visit of this man, the woran

7 who became Mrs. RIJA cane to Boulder, Colorado, whera ste

and RIJA were married. The marriage resulted in divorce

a short time later and the girl reportedly returned to

“-€he East Coast: from whence she.camé. ... -..... «+

‘Dr. SUILEY indicated that he has no further
information regarding this matter, but that Dean WILLIAM E,
BRIGGS, College of Arts and Sciences, University of
Colorado, Boulder, should be in possession of the letter

* purportedly written from.Canada by RIJA, and may be in
& position to assist in answering any question the Bureau
might have regarding RIJA's association with the University
of Colorado, since BRIGGS would have possession of these
records. He stated BRIGGS is a trusted confidant of his
and Dr. SMILEY's name should be used as an introduction
should the Bureau desire any information of BRIGGS.

Hay, 1972, ona of the principal questions raise! by Mr, Cray
vas ceneerning the jurisdictional authority of the PUI to
vonduet Intellinence oz sceuurity investigations. He commented
that in Kay, 1972, 0 conference vas held at Quantico, Virginia,
invelving a number of Euraau exceutives avd that during this
eonfercnea the question of ju¢isdictional authority vas
diseusser, Tollowing the conference, a spacial team vas set
up to discuss this subject, includinz Ne. frnstron: and formex
Speetal {rent Thoras Smith of the Intelligence Bivision.
Aceordiny to ir. Armstrong, it vas felt that it vould be
appropriate to develop a nov set of guidelines and not to
rely on priov statutes and Fresidential orders, aArnstrony
cecalled that after several meetinys of this group, Theras Smith
prepared a document consisting of 43 pages vhich was complated
approximately six veeks after the group vas created, Armstrong;
reenlled that the Jocument vac received in the Acting Director's
vfflee anc vas discussed at one of the regular afternoon
staf? conferences, At that time it tas agreed that the document
vas reod but that the timing vas not thought te be appropriate.
The thought was expressed that it vould be held in abeyance
until after the coming elections. It vas i, drmetrong's
belief that the matter might have been discussed betyeen
Attorney General Kleindienst and lr. Grays and it vas decided
not to push tha matter until after the elections. Mr. Armstrong
reealled advising tk. Smith of the location of the document and
the faet that it was being held in abeyanee until after the
elections,

the mattor of the above deoument did not ecma up
asoin until shortly before the confirmation hearings concern,

Ee. drmetxong commented that he doubted the wisdom of making
such o broad statement.

Shortly after Mr. Gray's statenant vas made,
information cane to Lr. Armstrong's attention vhich caused hin
to prepare a momorandum to lit. Cray indicating the possibility
of the existence of files in Mr. Hoover's office. Armotecong

he believed that the original of the menovandum vas retumoed

Attached is a proposed memorandum to the Attorney vid
General with a letterhead memorandum attached enclosing a copy ° J
of a memorandum J. H. Gale to Mr. Tolson dated July 30, 1964, :
captioned "Investigation of Ku ‘Kiux Klan and other Hate Groups. bs (V oy,
It appears that we are proposing to give the copy of the Gale
memorandum to the Senate Select Committee in response to their te
request by letter dated May 14, 1975, for a memorandum preparegf by, Nin tf
\

Gale relative to the subject matter of the 1964 memorandum. Yer

My reading of the memorandum revealed that it is a ness
deliberative document which quotes personal views of Mr. Sullivan,
Mr. Rosen, Mr. Belmont, and Mr. Gale. I am concerned that the
release of such a memorandum containing not only the personal views of
Bureau officials, but also identifying them by name could have an impact
on individuals in the future who may be asked to furnish their opinions
concerning policy matters in the FBI. As indicated by the Attorney General
in his speech in New York, it is essential that the Executive Branch have a
degree of privacy concerning policy discussions and expressions of
personal views by officials in order for the Executive to function properly.

I do recognize that we may not be able to resist giving the
Committee access to material documents that bear on particular issues
under investigation, however, I do recoumnend that when we are required
to produce deliberative documents, the names and other identifying data
relating Cae furnishing views be deleted.

Former Special Agent Richard H. Davis of the Peers or
Atlanta Office telephonically contacted SA Paul V. Daly of this
Division on 6-4-75 at which time he explained that he had been_
contacted. by Michael Epstein of captioned Committee at which time
Epstein requested that Davis make himself available for interview in
either Atlanta, Georgia, or travel to Washington, D. C. Davis informed

Epstein that he would have to obtain Bureau approval prior to submitting
to interview inasmuch as he had to obtain a release from his employment

secrecy agreement. V Va

Mr. Davis informed SA Daly that he was reluctant.
to agree to being interviewed by captioned Committee concerning his
activities as an Agent. It was pointed out to Mr. Davis that the
decision as to whether to agree to interview was his, but he was
advised that captioned Committee has subpoena power and might attempt
to force him to furnish information through the use of a subpoena.
He was informed that the Bureau was cooperating withScaptioned Committee
and their inquiry into FBI operations.

It was explained to Mr. Davis that if he desired to
allow himself to be interviewed, the Bureau would make available
an employee at his request to be available but not present during
interview. He was also advised that this Agent would not represent
him as private counsel. Mr. Davis was advised that the Bureau's
concern was not of matters of historical fact but rather testimony
might be required which could impair the Bureau's efforts to discharge
its responsibilities. It was. also explained that the Bureau representative
would assist him in making determination whether his response to a
particular question would ifdentify confidential informants, impair on-
going investigations, divulge information derived from other Government
agencies or foreign sources or expose sensitive investigative technique

and, therefore, a response should not be given. if

y Reference is made to Bureau letter to The peeks (a
General 6/20/75 captioned "United States Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC)," forwarding

letterhead memorandum for approval and forwarding to SSC. (

The Director asked if we have any amplification of we
this instruction (to submit items with unusual twist or
concerning prominent personalities for dissemination to the
President under the INLET Program) or do we know of any
submission responsive to this which illustrates interpretation?

There has been no amplification of this instruction,
nor any submission under INLET of an item on prominent
personalities that would show the interpretation of this
point,

With respect to the observation that this matter
should cause a congressional furor, it is noted that INLET
has already been afforded considerable publicity, beginning
in February, 1973, after an office memorandum on the subject
reached the news media, This publicity is why the Senate
Committee asked for documents on INLET, The White House and
Senator Bob Packwood inquired about the Program, A detailed
defense of INLET appeared in the Congressional Record,

By way of background, the INLET instruction that has
received the most publicity--items with an unusual twist or
concerning prominent personalities--was recalled by the author
of the INLET Program initiating letter as having been
specifically dictated by then Assistant Director W. C. a) jie

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY

While we cannot say exactly what former Assistant
Director W. C, Sullivan had in mind when he added the
instruction about items with an unusual twist, we can
speculate with a hypothetical example.

If we learned that a trusted assistant to an
important government official--an official who had taken
a “hard line" with respect to dealings with the Soviet Union,
for example--was under development by Soviet intelligence,
this would be an unusual twist to an item of intelligence
interest to the President involving a prominent person,

In such a hypothetical case, we would, of course,
advise the government official involved, and The Attorney
General and the President. We would have done this under
INLET and we would still disseminate this type of data.
INLET was only a vehicle for special dissemination.

For information.

I. FOUNDING

The Black Panther Party, with head-
quarters in Oakland, California, was
founded in 1966 by two Oakland Negroes
— Huey Percy Newton and Bobby George
Seale — both at that time at Merritt Col-
lege in Oakland. The name and symbol
of the new party were taken from the
Lowndes County Freedom Organization,
an Alabama political party known infor-
mally in 1965 as the Black Panther Party.

From the writings of communists,
revolutionaries, and black militants,
Newton and Seale allegedly selected
ideas around which they could build a
revolutionary frame that suited the needs
of their party. Influential writings in-
cluded those of Mao Tse-tung, Chinese Communist
leader; Frantz Fanon, West Indian psychiatrist who
advocated violence for Algerian nationalists;
Emesto ‘/Che’’ Guevara, one-time lieutenant of
Cuba’s Fidel Castro and a principal architect of 20th
century guerrilla warfare; Malcolm X, American black
nationalist who advocated violence to obtain Negro
“4reedom’’; and W. E. B. DuBois, Negro educator who
became a member of the Communist Party, USA, at
the age of 93.

The organization was at first called the Black
Panther Party for Self-Defense; however, the ‘<Self-
Defense’”’ was removed in 1968 in an effort to project
a more politically oriented image to prospective
sympathizers and supporters.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

HUEY PERCY NEWTON

BOBBY GEORGE SEALE:

As head of the new Black Panther Party, Newton assumed the title Minister of
Defense, and Seale was named Chairman. When questioned about the membership
of their organization, Newton and Seale gave the since oft-repeated reply: ‘Those

who know don’t say. Those who say don’t know.’””

The militancy of the group,

however, had an immediate appeal to the discontented, restless youth of Oakland’s

ghettos.

Il. BLACK PANTHER OBJECTIVES

The Black Panther Party “Platform and Program’ is repeated in each issue of
the official Party publication, The Black Panther.

October 1966

Black Panther Party
Platform and Program

What We Want
What We Believe

Ne:

1. We want freedom. We want power to determine the destiny of our
Black Community.

We believe that black people will not be free until we are able to deter-
mine our destiny.

2. We want full employment for our people.

We believe that the federal government is responsible and obligated to
give every man employment or a guaranteed income. We believe that if
the white American businessmen will not give full employment, then the
means of production should be taken from the businessmen and placed in
the community so that the people of the community can organize and em-
ploy all of its people and give a high standard of living.

55020 DocId:32989606 Page 126



3. We want an end to the robbery by the CAPITALIST of our Black
Community.

We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are
demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and. two mules. Forty acres
and two mules was promised 100 years ago as restitution for slave labor
and mass murder of black people. We will accept the payment in currency
which will be distributed to our many communities. The Germans are now
aiding the Jews in Israel for the genocide of the Jewish people. The Ger-
mans murdered six million Jews. The American racist has taken part in
the slaughter of over fifty million black people; therefore, we feel that this
is a modest demand that we make.

4. We want decent housing, fit for shelter of human beings.

We believe that if the white landlords will not give decent housing to
our black community, then the housing and the land should be made into
cooperatives so that our community, with government aid, can build and
make decent housing for its people.

5. We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this
decadent American society. We want education that teaches us our true
history and our role in the present-day society.

We believe in an educational system that will give to our people a knowl-
edge of self. If a man does not have knowledge of himself and his position
in society and the world, then he has little chance to relate to anything
else.

6. We want all black men to be exempt from military service.

We believe that Black people. should not be forced to fight in the mili-
tary service to defend a racist government that does not protect us. We
will not fight and kill other people of color in the world who, like black
people, are being victimized by the white racist government of America.
We will protect ourselves from the force and violence of the racist police
and the racist military, by whatever means necessary.

7. We want an immediate end to POLICE BRUTALITY and MURDER
of black people.

We believe we can end police brutality in our black community by or-
ganizing black self-defense groups that dre dedicated to defending our
black community from racist police oppression and brutality. The Second
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States gives a right to bear
arms. We thetefore believe that all black people should arm themselves
for self-defense.

8. We want freedom for all black men held in federal, state, county
and city prisons and jails.

We believe that all black people should be released from the many
jails and prisons because they have not received a fair and impartial trial.

HW 55020 DocId:32989606 Page 127


9. We want all black people when brought to trial to be tried in court by
a jury of their peer group or people from their black communities, as
defined by the Constitution of the United States.

We believe that the courts should follow the United States Constitution
so that black people will receive fair trials. The 14th Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution gives a man a right to be tried by his peer group. A peer
is a person from a similar economic, social, religious, geographical, en-
vironmental, historical and racial background. To do this the court will be
forced to select a jury from the black community from which the black
defendant came. We have been, and are being tried by all-white juries
that have no understanding of the “average reasoning nian” of the black
community.

10. We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace,
And as our major political objective, a United Nations-supervised plebis-
cite to be held throughout the black colony in which only black colonial
subjects will be allowed to participate, for the purpose of determining the
will of black people as to their national destiny.

When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and
equal station to which the laws of nature and nature’s God entitle them, a
decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare
the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, thatall men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;
that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to
secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of
government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people
to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its
foundation on such prineiples, and organizing its powers in such form, as
to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Pru-
dence. indeed. will dictate that governments long established should not
be changed for light and transient causes; and, accordingly, all experience
hath shown. that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
sufferable. than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they
are accustomed. But, when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pur-
suing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under ab-
solute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such govern-
ment, and to provide new guards for their future security.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Ill. RISE OF BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Proclaiming a legal right to bear arms, the Panthers by early 1967 had begun to
appear in public wearing black leather jackets and black berets, openly carrying
shotguns, rifles, or pistols, and shouldering bandoliers of ammunition.

Calling the police ‘‘pigs,’”’ the Panthers began a buildup in Negro areas of the
idea that police departments, especially that in Oakland, were dedicated to the
brutalization and harassment of minority groups, and, acting as an appendage of
white government authority, were working toward the eventual annihilation (geno-
cide) of the Negro race.

Invasion of California State Legis/ature

The first incident that brought national attention to this group occurred on May
2, 1967, as the California Legislature was in session in Sacramento. Approximately
40 members of the Black Panther Party, carrying loaded rifles, pistols, and shotguns,
and some wearing bandoliers of ammunition about their waists or draped over their
shoulders, burst into the Chamber. They were protesting a bill being introduced on
that date outlawing the carrying of loaded weapons in public and were proclaiming
their right to bear arms and criticize the police. Before they were arrested, they
passed out mimeographed leaflets calling on all Negroes to end the “terrorist”
oppression of colored races by white America and referring to the preparation of
concentration camps in the United States as a beginning of genocide.

Police Officer Meets Panthers--and Death

The Panthers became more militant with the passing of time. At 5:00 a.m.,
October 28, 1967, two Oakland, California, patrol officers, John F. Frey and Herbert
C. Heanes, made a routine traffic violation car stop. While the officers were a-
waiting the results of the car registration check by radio, the driver, Huey Newton,
got out of the car. Suddenly, shooting broke out. Officer Frey was killed; Officer
Heanes was wounded critically; and Newton received a stomach wound, He stopped
a passing automobile and had the driver take him to a hospital where he was taken
into custody and hospitalized. After a state trial, which began July 15, 1968,
Newton was sentenced on September 27, 1968, to serve from 2 to 15 years on a
charge of voluntary manslaughter.*

“Free Huey” Campaign

Two days after Patrolman Frey’s death, the Huey Newton Defense Fund was
established at a meeting of a section of the Negro community of Oakland.

The cry of ‘‘Free Huey’? became a clarion call. The imprisoned Newton was
built up in the public eye as “black and bold in defense of his people.’ Each

It was ruled later that the presiding judge in this trial erred in instructions to the jury.
Newton was released August 5, 1970, and scheduled for retrial.

bringing. its own axe to x J such organizations
as the anarchist New Left group named Students
for a Democratic Society; the Trotskyist Socialist
Workers Party and its youth group, the Young
Socialist Alliance; the Communist Chinese-
oriented Progressive Labor Party; the Communist
Party, USA, and its youth affiliate, the W. E. B.
DuBois Clubs of America; and militant campus
groups, black and white, began to gather in sup-
port of the Panthers, who were willing not only
to defy the establishment, but to destroy it.

Enter Leroy Eldridge Cleaver
LEROY ELDRIDGE CLEAVER Early in 1967, the Panthers were joined by a
recent parolee from the California prison system,
author of a best-selling autobiography, Soul On Ice, staff writer for the magazine
Ramparts, and admitted Marxist — Leroy Eldridge Cleaver.

In Soul On Ice, Cleaver wrote: “I sought out his (Marx’s) books...It was like
taking medicine for me to find that, indeed, American Capitalism deserved all the
hatred and contempt that | felt for it in my heart....’”

After Newton was jailed, although he remained the undisputed leader, it soon
became apparent that Cleaver, designated Minister of Information, was projecting
a major leadership image. The Party began to further widen its publicity, nation-
ally and internationally, and enlarge its radical support and revolutionary intent.

As an example of this spreading influence of the Panther Party, the 1968
National Election ticket of the Peace and Freedom Party, a coalition of radical
groups, included Cleaver as candidate for the Presidential nomination; Newton as
candidate for the 7th Congressional District of Alameda County, California; Kath-
leen Cleaver, 18th Assembly District, California State Legislature; Bobby Seale,
17th Assembly District, California State Legislature. Cleaver received a national
total of almost 200,000 votes. Only a small percentage of the California elector-
ate cast their votes for Newton, Seale, and Kathleen Cleaver.

On the evening of April 6, 1968, Cleaver and several Panthers became involved
in a shoot-out with Oakland police officers. The incident resulted in the death of
a Panther, the wounding of two police officers, and the wounding and arrest of
Cleaver. Cleaver’s parole was revoked immediately and he was returned to prison.
After much publicity, he was later released on bail by a Superior Court Judge who
tuled that the jeopardy of his parole status stemmed “from his undue eloquence in
pursuing political goals...offensive to many of his contemporaries.’ This decision
was overruled by the District Court of Appeals and upheld by the California Court
of. Appeals. Cleaver was ordered to return to prison by November 27, 1968. Elect-
ing to become a Federal fugitive, he disappeared in late November, 1968, going
first to Havana, Cuba, and later to Algiers, where he has established residence.

International Committee to Defend Eldridge Cleaver

Soon after Cleaver’s arrest in the spring of 1968, approximately 150 prominent
individuals sponsored the establishment of an International Committee to Defend
Eldridge Cleaver. The committee intended to dispatch a team to Europe to gain

Rise of the Black Panther Party

In May, 1968, the hard-core membership of the Black Panther Party was esti-
mated at only 125, and Panther activity was confined fargely to the San Francisco-
Oakland, Califomia, area. However, because of the dramatic shoot-outs, the
“Free Huey’’ Campaign, the funds established for the defense of both Newton and
Cleaver, the widespread publicity, and the support given readily by white radical
groups and individual sympathizers, the Black Panther Party began to grow rapidly,
not only in membership but in militancy and influence. | Chapters began to appear
in major cities throughout the country. By the end of 1968, the membership had
reached nearly 2,000, with additional thousands of sympathizers and supporters.

National Committee to Combat Fascism

Set. up to coexist with Black Panther Party branches in various cities in the
United States are chapters of another organization called National Committee to
Combat Fascism. In actuality, there is little difference between the two. This
group, a Panther Party front, was set up as the result of a revolutionary conference,
called National Conference for a United Front Against Fascism, held in Oakland,
California, in July, 1969. The conference, sponsored by the Black Panther Party
and assisted by the anarchist Students for a Democratic Society and the Communist
Party, USA, was called to form a coalition of black and white radicals, described
as ‘oppressed people.’”

The National Committee to Combat Fascism is considered by Party leaders to
be the “political organizing bureau’’ of the Black Panther Party. Its specific task
allegedly is to raise the political level of the people and educate them against
the system.

International Section

On September 13, 1970, the International Section of the Black Panther Party
officially opened in Algiers. Joining Cleaver on the staff were his wife, Kathleen,
and Field Marshal Donald Lee Cox, a fugitive from justice. Cox faces charges
of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder, based on a
warrant issued on April 20, 1970, at Baltimore, Maryland. He also failed to appear
on May 14, 1970, in San Francisco, to answer Federal firearms charges.

This section, in its entirety, was expelled from the Black Panther Party by
Huey Newton on February 27, 1971. The expulsion resulted from tensions and
differences between Party hierarchy which led to disruptive factionalism.

V. FUNDS

The money by which the Black Panther Party operates comes from a number of
sources. There are substantial private contributions; fees for public appearances,
such as campus speeches, radio, and television appearances; payments for mag-
azine articles; collections for trials and bail funds in this country and abroad;
subscriptions and individual sales of the Party’s official organ, The Black Panther;
fund-raising activities sponsored by sympathizers and supporters; sales of record-
ings of interviews and speeches; and financial aid from radicals and extremists.

According to the press, there is reason to believe that the Panthers, to obtain
additional funds, are engaging in criminal activities, such as burglaries and
robberies.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

VI. “SOCIALISTIC” PROGRAMS

Panther Party leaders insist their primary aim is to serve the ‘‘people,’’
meaning ghetto blacks. To establish good intent, Party officials have set up a se-
ties of community services aimed at recruiting members and sympathizers and
building Party influence in ghetto areas. These programs, described by the Pan-
thers as ‘socialistic’ programs, are suppos_ “to be carried out by all Party
branches and include: “liberation schools” to give.“‘our people a knowledge of
self’’; free health clinics, with money, medical supplies and professional serv-
ices donated by laymen and professionals in the community; free clothing programs,
with clothing donated by the community; Community Information Centers, to ‘‘an-
swer the basic needs of the people’; and a monthly free shuttle bus service for
families of blacks in prison. Few of these programs actually are carried out, and
those that have been attempted have been mostly unsuccessful.

The program that has received the most publicity is the “‘breakfast program,”’
devised as a further means of indoctrinating Negro youth in Panther teachings of
racism and rebellion. As expressed in The Black Panther, June 14, 1969, “The
youth we are feeding will surely feed the revolution.’ Breakfasts are held for
ghetto children either at churches, housing projects, Panther Community informa-
tion Centers, or other space that can be obtained: free of charge. Panthers usually
ask local businessmen to donate food or money to this program, boycotting stores
that refuse to participate. At these functions, children have been known to sing
such chants as: “I am a revolutionary. | am a revolutionary. There’s going to be
some barbecue if Huey’s not set free. Power to the people.’

In 1969, Panther “Coloring Books’? were printed and given out at these break-
fasts. The books contained 22 pages of drawings teaching the children to distrust,
hate, and kill police officers.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

Vil. TACTICS

The Black Panther Party is a violent revolutionary group whose members pro-
voke confrontations with law enforcement officers and whose leaders incite racial
hatred and preach urban guerrilla warfare.

Target: Police

Panthers claim that black communities are occupied by the police in the same
way and for the same purpose that foreign troops occupy conquered territory and
that these forces, operating under ‘establishment’ orders, are engaged in gradual
annihilation of the black race. Blacks, according to the Panthers, must, through
urban guerrilla warfare, use guns to liberate themselves from the ever-present
repressive enemy. Children in Panther ‘‘schools’’ do their exercises to the rhythm
of: “There is a pig upon the hill — if you don’t kill him the Panthers will.”

Numerous claims have been made that the Black Panther Party is an innocent
victim of police persecution and genocide. This charge is rendered absurd by fact,
During 1970, 6 police officers were killed and 22 wounded through acts of violence
traced to the Panthers. One officer, in 1969, was killed by a Panther with a shot-
gun blast at point-blank range as the officer lay wounded and helpless on the
ground,

Out of 20 members named by the Panther Party as “killed in cold blood’? by
the police, four were killed by members of a rival black extremist group on the
west coast; one died of barbiturate intoxication; one was shot and killed by
a store owner during a robbery attempt; one was killed by his wife over a love
affair he was having with a female Black Panther; and another was allegedly tor-
tured and killed by Panther Party members. Of the remaining twelve, two were
found dead on the street, the victims of unknown assailants, and ten were involved
in shoot-outs with police officers.

Attacks on Others

Panther attacks have not been limited to the police. While claiming their
intent to protect the black community, Panthers have assaulted and threatened
citizens who have tried to assist the police.

Neighborhood stores have been forced to ‘‘contribute’” food supplies and
money under fear of Panther violence. Many other persons have also been victim-
ized, as shown by the fact that in 1969 alone 348 Panther members were arrested
for serious crimes, including murder, armed robbery, rape, bank robbery, and
burglary.

On April 21, 1969, 21 members of the Black Panther Party were charged in New
York in a 30-count indictment with conspiring to bomb public places and murder
policemen and with possessing dangerous weapons.

Weapons Caches

Stockpiles of machine guns, sawed-off shotguns, rifles, hand grenades, thou-
sands of rounds of ammunition, Molotov cocktails, gunpowder, and accumulations
of bayonets, swords, and machetes have been confiscated from Panther offices.

“Revolutionary Suicide’

On August 7, 1970, Superior Court Judge Harold Haley, the Deputy District
Attorney, and three other persons were tied together with piano wire and dragged
from a San Rafael, California, courtroom and taken as hostages by three armed
Negro convicts, one of whom was standing trial for stabbing a San Quentin prison
guard. The escapees were assisted by the defendant’s 17-year-old brother who
supplied them with weapons for the escapade. Judge Haley, who had a sawed-off
shotgun taped to his neck, and the other hostages were forced into a waiting van.
When the authorities tried to stop the kidnappers, the judge was brutally murdered;
the Deputy District Attorney was injured seriously; and another hostage was
slightly wounded. Three Negroes were slain and one was wounded.

Immediately thereafter, Huey Newton declared the killing of Judge Haley as
being of “‘historical’’ importance to the Black Panther Party. This declaration was
based on the Panther belief that all black prisoners, regardless of their crimes, are
political prisoners and should be released.

CONFISCATED PANTHER WEAPONS

The perpetrators of the courtroom incident were lauded by the Panthers as
setting another ‘revolutionary example for black people.’’ In commenting further,
The Black Panther of August 15, 1970, stated:

“The example that these brothers have set will be followed by
many and many will rise to choose revolutionary suicide rather
than reactionary suicide. Black people will unleash in great
numbers the Black kamakazi..."”

In his eulogy at services for the slain Negroes, Newton said: ‘Our comrades
have taught us all a revolutionary lesson. They have intensified the struggle and
placed it on a-higher level.’

Panther ‘Justice’

Recalcitrant members of the Black Panther Party are sometimes victims of
Panther “justice.” As one example, Panther Chairman Bobby Seale was brought
to trial in New Haven, Connecticut, for the torture-murder of Panther Alex Rackley.
Rackley, a Panther suspected of being an informant, was scalded, murdered, and
dumped in a swamp.

For a variety of reasons, many members have been purged from the Party.
These incidents are usually written up in The Black Panther in special articles

accompanied by photographs.

‘There is nosplitin the Black Panther
Party, at all, But the main thing that we
‘want fo get across, I want to get across,
to the people fs that the Party is based
on Survival Programs to serve the peo-
ple, and these survival programs ~
from Breakfast for Children to the
recent programs that I'm designing
right here in jail, in my time that I'm
not in court, which is a decent housing
fit for shelter of human beings program
= these are survival programs - and
this program andall other programs
that all other revolutionary organiza
tions have are survival programs, that
must_ sustain the people so the people
can wage a revolutionary struggle,
And Fidridge Cleaver, who's de~
nouncing these types of programs and
carrying on with all those other divi-

sionary jive tactics, is negating the real
meaning of a People’s revolutionary
struggle, That's why the Black Panther
Party belongs to the people, because the
survival programs come forth, and we
set up the survival programs to sustain
the people’s revolutionary struggle.
Even the Vietnamese people, if one
would check it out, have their survival
programs; they have their cooperative,
functional survival programs throughout
their land, amongst their people, The
people just don’t have guns alone fight
ing their battle, The people over there
have actual everyday, functional, con-
structive survival programs. In their
countries, in their lands, and in their
everyday operations: in fighting the
capitalist pigs who occupy thetr coun-
try, they have survival programs, And
those survival programs sustain the
revolutionary struggle there. Of
course, our sucvival programs will be
directly related tohere in America, But
1, myself, send solidarity and support to
all the socialistic, revolutionary peo-
ples of the world, and the socialistic
countries and lands - and the different
war zones, where the people, the mass-
es in those lands, are fighting against
the capitalistic, imperialistic ruling
class circles,

‘And Eldridge Cleaver - who negates
the very survival programs that the
Party is trying to set forth, that the
Central Committee is trying to set
forth, and all the real dedicated, hard-
working brothers in the Party aretry-
ing to set forth to educate the people
and serve the people, these survival
programs ( that) sustain the people's.

to the gas chambers, He’s aiding the
power structure and causing usto bein
the prisons, because the political pri-
soners are the ones who really initiate
and work hard to maintain the survival
programs forthe revolution, the peo-
ple’s revolutionary struggle.

Only the masses of the people can
really {ree political prisoners, And the
people must see the value andthe vali-
ity of the survival programs, And get-
ting on down to it, sothe people can un-
derstand where it's at, so thatthepeo~

this country, and the revolutionary
movement (who are initiating these
programs), | am trying myself to get
people to understand, that we are heau-
tifully behind them and we areglad and
send greetings to them and praise the
people who are in the solidarity com-
mittees in other countries, and in fact
here in America, here in Ameri-
KKK-~a, [think that the people really
have to understand who and what the
Black Panther Party is, so that these
reactionary, counter-revolutionary ,
divisionary tactics will not be misun-
derstood, ‘The Party is not falling apart,
It’s just that Bldridge Cleaver has per-
sonally defected hist own self from the
Party. He defected from the Party,

‘And I, Bobby Seale, am the Chairman

of only one Party. And that Party is the
Party that Brother Huey P. Newton is
the Minister of Defense of and one of the
supreme, top servants of the people;
that Brother David Ililliard is the Chief
of Staff of; that Brother June lilliard is
the Assistant Chief of Staff of; that
Bobby Uutton was a member of, before
the pigs murdered him, Lam the Chair-
man of only one Party, that Brother

“Revolutionary Art”

The most prominent artist on The Black Panther staff is Minister of Culture
Emory Douglas. Although he prepares a large number of cartoons, other Panther
artists are also represented. These cartoons characterize the Government and
local law enforcement as “‘pigs’’ and call for the overthrow of the Government
and the killing of Government officials, as well as police officers.

International News

Panthers profess to believe that American Negroes comprise isolated ‘‘col-
onies” in the heart of the ‘mother’ country, and are part of the Third World,
defined as the nonwhite, undeveloped, and underdeveloped countries of the world.
The 10-Point Program of the Black Panther Party includes, as a major political
objective, a United-Nations-supervised plebiscite to be held throughout the
black colony to determine the national destiny of American Negroes.

To internationalize their Party and enlarge their importance, Panther leaders
have sought acceptance, support, and funds from sources abroad. They have made
numerous trips to foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Palestine,
Germany, France, England, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Soviet Union, North Korea,
North Vietnam, and the Chinese Mainland.

Both at home and abroad, Panther leaders loudly proclaim anti-American
sentiments and align themselves politically with the aims and tactics of enemy
lands. The international contacts most important to the Panthers are made with
revolutionary groups and communist countries, especially those that more closely
follow Maoist thinking. The international news section of The Black Panther
reflects attempts by the Black Panther Party to attract such attention, support,
and aid.

TELEGRAM TO
COMRADE KIM IL SUNG

KIM IL SUNG

PREMIER OF THE CABINET
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES RE-
PUBLIC OF KOREA

June 25th marks the 20thanniver-
sary of the U,S, imperialist ag-
gressive invasion of the DPRK in
1950,

The Black Panther Party takes
this occasion to salute the DPRK
and the wise and brave leader of the
40 million Korean people, Com-
rade Kim Ul Sung.

We recognize and respect the
long history of resistance and vic-
tory that Comrade Kim IL Sung
and the 40 m‘llion Korean people
have contributed to the world wide
struggle against imperialism and
fascism; the shining examples of
socialist construction while under
severe conditions of U.S, pro-
vocation and aggression, the many
brilliant ideological contributions
you have made to the socialist
camp and in particular the con-
cept of Juche’.

Because of our historical ex-
perience in America; because we
are faced with no alternatives but
genocide or liberation we under-
stand the criminal nature and
gangster logic of the U.S, ruling

class, Black people are increas~
ingly the victims of overtmilitary
aggression and U,S, plots to sub-
vert our struggle for national sal-
vation, Under these conditions we
have an increasing awareness that
the expulsion of the U,S, imper-
ialist burglars from Korean soil
and the reunification of Korea will
be a victory for the Korean peo-
ple and a victory for oppressed
people the world over,

We see clearly that the reuni-
fication of Korea is not seperate
from the salvation of Black and
other oppressed people in fascist
America, As gang boss Nixon and
his mob of criminals intensify
theix attempts to loot Asia they
are intensifying their murderous
repression of Black people in
America, These attacks will be
met with revolutionary solidarity
manifested in action, both around
the world and in the gangsters
lair, and with one-beat-a-hundred
fighters in Africa, Asia, Latin
America, and North America; the
U.S.A, will surely be broughtto the
peoples JUSTICE,

ON CHAIRMAN MAO TSE TUNG’S DECLARATION
OF 20 MAY, 1970

In this declaration, Chairman Mao
Tse Ting has set forth a brilliant
and timely analysis of the qualita-
tively new situation that exists in the
world as a result of the treacherous
new acts of aggression launched by
the fascist, imperialist Nixon-

Chinesepeoples.

‘This declaration pulls together into
clear focus the revolutionary struggles
and the liberation struggles ofthe pao-
ple of the whole world, including the
revolutionary struggle of the American
people themselves,

‘Speaking specifically for the Black
Panther Party, but reflecting the
sentiments of millions of oppressed
People inside the United States, it has
become crystal clear to us that
rampant imperialist aggression onthe
internationat scale and vicious fascist
repression on the domestic scale are
the’ two faces of the criminal govern-
ment of the United States and the
calculated policy of the American
ruling. circles, For 400 years now,
Black people inside the United States
have been the long-suffering victims
of fascist violence and repression,
But under the Nixon-Pentagon clique,
this reactionary violence and repres-
sion has been escalated to newheights
of barbaric crucity, At the same time,
in order to put down the already gi-
gantic and still growing mass move-
ment among White Americans against
the wreckless and sanguinary poli-
cies and imperialist adventures of
the U.S, government, the cowardly
‘Nixon-Pentagon clique has unleashed
@ Bloodbath against the Americanpeo-
ple as a whole, creating for itself
new enemies who have joined hands
with those who were already deter-
mined to carry out a struggle to the
Bitter end against an economic, polit-
teal, and social system that is do-
minated by the madmen in the
Pentagon and that is responsible for
the misery and bloodshed all over the
world today,

Chairman Mao Tse Tung captures
the truth of the situation when he
oints out the unprecedented isula-

DocId:32989606 Page 160

tion of the Nixon-Pentagon clique.
Never before have these criminals
been so exposed and isolated as they
are today. And never before has it
been so clear that this criminality
can only be ended by the people rising
‘up to seize their oun destiny from
the handfull of willful exploiters and
murderers that now have the power
in their hands.

Coupling a revolutionary call to
arms with revolutionary optimism in
the assurance of victory, Chairman
Mao Tse Tung, the great leader of
the Chinese Revolution, hero and tea~
cher of the revolutionary people of
the world, has performed an inval-
uable service to all mankind by step-
bing forward at this time to renew
the people's indictment of the common.
enemy of us all--U.S, Fascism and
Imperialist Aggression. These coura-
geous words of Chairman Moo Tse
Tung will give new heart to the peo~
ples in their lonely anddifficult strug-
gles to throw off the shackles and
chains of oppression now being held
in place by U.S. Fascism and Im-
berialism,

Lastly, we wish to point out that
only the enemies of the people and
those who shirk their revolutionary
duties and who are afraid of their
own shadows will find fault with Chair-
man Mao Tse Tung’s declaration. For
our part, we welcome it, because we
have teamed, by shedding our blood,
that only through relentless struggle,
by resorting to arms inside the very
house of U.S. Fascism and Imperial-
ism itself, can we gain our freedom
and liberation, This is what our ex-
perience has taught us and this is
the faith that will sustain us as we
push forward our struggle..

LONG LIVE CHAIRMAN MAOTSETUNG!
LONG LIVE THE VICTORY OF THE
PEOPLES’ WAR!

DEATH TO THE U.S, FASCISM AND
IMPERIALIST AGGRESSION!

ALL POWER T0 THEPEOPLE!

met with Jack Smith and Lester B, Seidel of the SSC staff, ?

At the outset Mr, Seidel indicated that SSC would do case .
studies on various organizations against which the COINTELPRO was
directed. Black Panther Party (BPP) had been chosen for the start
because many BPP members had been involved in and convicted of
criminal activity. He distributed copies of a document (a copy of
which is attached) outlining the purpose of the meeting and setting
out requests that will be made of the Bureau through appropriate
channels in Connection with this @ase study. Includéd inthis”
document, along with requests for various Bureau documents regarding
COINTELPRO as it pertains to the BPP, were requests for a list of
all local police departments and personnel contacted, a list of all
media persons contacted and a list of all FBI perso connected,

with this program and their present locations. Be. a

The investigative responsibilities of the Buréau, as
relates to the BPP, were described generally to Messrs. Seidel and
Smith highlighting the origin of this violence-prone organization
and the series of violent confrontations in which it participated in
the late 1960s, Mr, Seidel stated that he was specifically interested
in ascertaining the extent of COINTELPRO and how it related to the 2

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

instances of institution of counterintelligence activities were
discussed, and it was indicated that these activities were minor as
far as the overall BPP investigation was concerned.

In connection with COINTELPRO, the Bureau letter to
SAC, San Francisco dated 5/11/70 captioned "'Counterintelligence and
Special Operations"! was discussed. Basically, this hetter suggests
San Francisco consider a proposal that through the use of documents
subtly incorporating false information, attempt to give the BPP
the impression that the documents were stolen by a disgruntled
police employee who is sympathetic to the Panthers. This
document was presented to the House of Representatives Committee on
Internal Security in 1974 and was included in their publication of
hearings conducted by that Committee. Messrs. Seidel and Smith
wanted to know if the activities outlined in this letter had been
implemented by the San Francisco or Los Angeles Offices. He was
advised that this letter was not implemented as it had requested
comments and recommendations of the San Francisco Office, and that
Office had recommended against the proposals contained therein.

Mr. Seidel asked the identity of the SAC who recommended
against this proposal and was advised that the SAC there, at that
time, would not necessarily have had personal knowledge of the matter.
He then asked identity of supervisor who recommended against proposal
and was advised this information was available in the field office.
Concerning COINTELPRO in general, he inquired as to specific
techniques used against the BPP and whether forgery and wiretaps
had been a part of the program. He was advised that we were unable
to furnish that information without extensive file review.

. Mr. Seidel attempted to discuss Special Operations but
he was advised that the matter was not within the purview of the
current meeting.

Mr. Seidel explained that they would be traveling to
San Francisco and intended to interrogate personnel in that Office
as well as unspecified outsiders who may have been involved in
COINTELPRO. Mr. Seidel stated that he had asked for the meeting
with Bureau personnel to obtain background data to aid them in these |

interrogations. Both Messrs. Seidel and Smith expressed
appreciation for the assistance given them at this meeting and
both additionally expressed their feeling that the Bureau had
done a good and proper job in its investigation.

During the course of this meeting a monograph on the
BPP prepared by the Bureau in March of 1971'was used for back-
ground data. Mr. Seidel expressed a desire to have a copy of this

document. This document, which is prepared from public source
data, was compiled for public distribution and, if you approve,
a copy will be furnished to Mr. Seidel.

Director See'y

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that
a representative of captioned Committee requested to be given a cl i eg
briefing concerning counterintelligence programs as applied to our yY
investigation of the Black Panther Party in San Francisco.

Lester Seidel, staff member of captioned Committee A
who is assigned the area of COINTELPROS, advised that the 4
Committee is preparing what he termed case studies on COINTELPROS 7 I. :
in four separate areas. He defined these areas as the Black Panther

Party in San Francisco, White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi,
the Professor Morris J. Starsky incident, and the Fred Hampton case

(Black Panther Party leader in Chicago who was killed during a police

raid in Chicago, Hlinois).

Seidel previously had requested the Bureau arrange
interviews of various Bureau personnel whom he considered familiar
with the San Francisco Black Panther Party investigation, and at that
time stated he intended to interview these individuals in two or three
weeks. Mr. Seidel requested that prior to conducting interviews
concerning this particular area, he desired to be briefed during the !
week of June 8 concerning the Bureau's general overall investigation
of the Black Panther Party in San Francisco, along with the use of
counterintelligence proposals against that organization. In this regard
he desired that someone knowledgeable in this aspect be made availabl
to brief him concerning this matter.

On 6/9/75, Mr. K. William O'Connor telephonically baaaiiledaeas
advised me that the Committee is interested in information concerning
certain electronic surveillance coverage instituted at the request of the
White House concerning seventeen individuals. Mr. O'Connor said that
he understands that a letter was addressed to the White House by the .
Bureau furnishing copies of documents that summarized the information Nar
v jj

available to the Bureau concerning the alleged seventeen wiretaps.
Mr. O'Connor requested that he be briefed concerning this matter
in order for him to discuss the Committee's requests.

It appears that Mr. O'Connor may be referring to a letter
dated July 23, 1974, that was addressed to Mr. George P. Williams,
Associate Counsel to the President, at the White House. A memorandum
was addressed to the Attorney General also dated July 23, 1974, captioned
"Electronic Coverage Placed At The Request of the White House, " which
advised the Department that pursuant to the authorization of the Deputy
Attorney General certain documents had been furnished to Mr. Williams
at the White House.

That the Intelligence Division identify the materials involved

Attached herewith in 14 bound volumes are excised (
copies of Exhibits A through E of the Department report of FBI i
Counterintelligenace Program (Cointelpro) activities, prepared by
the committee chaired by former Assistant Attorney General Henry E.
Petersen.

These exhibits are individual write-ups prepared by
the FBI of each proposed action in the Communist Party, Socialist
Workers Party, White Hate, Black Extremist, and New Left Cointelpros.

Ia my letter to you dated April 21, 1975, I recommended
against release of these exhibits to the Senate Select Committee as they
are internal work papers which were prepared as a part of the
deliberative process for aa in-house Department investigation. I
strongly object to the release of these exhibits. In the event you deem
it necessary to release these exhibits to the Senate Select Committee,

T request the enckeed copies, which have been excised in an attempt to
avoid intrusions upon individuals' right of privacy and compromise of
sensitive investigative techniques and sources, be made available.

On 6/11/75 Legal Counsel advised Mr. K. William O'Connor
of the Department of our objection and our desire that excisions be made

if we are overruled. Mr. O'Connor suggested the excised material be
prepared on an expedite basis. It appears the Department will nake
available these exhibits to the Senate Select Committee but we feel we
should be on record as relates to FBI recommendations and objections.

This letter and exhibits A through E, which will be made

FROM

SU,

6/4/75
COSENSTUDY 7 78>)

On 6/4/75, Mrs. Dorothy Skillman, former Executive
Assistant..to. Mr. Clyde Tc Tolson, was interviewed by Mr. Mark H.
Gittenstein and Miss Mary Deoreo of the Senate Select Committee
Staff. Mrs. Skillman was escorted to the interview by former
Assistant to the Director John P, Mohr who remained outside
the interview room during the interview. Prior to the interview,
Mrs. Skillman was met by SA L. F. Schwartz at which time she
advised that she had been advised by Mr. John Hotis, Office i) re
of Legal Counsel, that the interview was to be concerning a
Mr. Hoover's Official and Confidential (OC) files and that if
questions came up during the interview on other matters which
might impinge on sensitive sources and methods, current Bureau
investigations, etc,, she was free to request an interruption
of the interview to consult with Mr. Schwartz.

The interview of Mrs, Skillman commenced at 2:30 p.m.,
and it was terminated at approximately 4:30 p.m, On only one
occasion toward the end of the interview, Mrs. Skillman asked
to consult with Mr. Mohr and Mr. Schwartz. She advised that
the interviewers had asked her concerning her knowledge of
what might have been in certain cartons which were reportedly
stored in the recreation room area of the late Director's
residence. Mrs. Skillman stated that she thought these cartons
contained many of the gifts and mementos that had been collected
by Mr. Hoover over a period of years. After consulting with
Mr. Mohr, she realized that she knew this only from comments
that had been made to her by Mr. Mohr and had no firsthand
knowledge of the contents of the cartons. On Mr. Mohr's advice,
she advised the interviewers that she had no firsthand
knowledge of what was in the cartons but that she knew that
Mr. Mohr was aware of what was in them because he was present
when the appraisers of Mr. Tolson's estate inventoried the
entire house including these cartons, At the con¢lusion of
ithe interview, Mr, Gittenstein commented to Mr, Mohr that he
might have further questions to ask him concerning the contents
lof the cartons but would probably handle that iby. a telephone call

Re: Interview of Mrs, Dorothy Skillman
6/4/75
Senstudy 75

After the completion of the interview, Mrs. Skillman
advised Mr. Mohr and Mr. Schwartz that the interviewers had
asked her a great number of questions concerning her knowledge
of the OC files which she said was very limited, the layout
of Mr. Hoover's house and the work that Mrs, Skillman and
Miss Gandy had done at the residence subsequent to Mr. Hoover's
death, She stated that the interviewers were quite courteous
and in no way antagonistic. Mr. Mohr requested Mrs. Skillman
to type up an informal memorandum concerning the interview
and he indicated that when this was done, he would provide
a copy to the Bureau.

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise “~
the Bureau has Been requested to again make available
Newark office secretaries, Mary Ann Massa and M. Ann bk hd-

Mierzejewski for interview by captioned Committee-and that
the Department and White House had instructed that they not
be made available until such time as the Committee decides
to allow Bureau representatives to be present during inter-
view.

By way of background, you will recall that these
employees were released from the Employment Agreement and
were made available for interview on May 20, 1975, by
captioned Committee. However, the Department in objection
stated that they were desirous that a Bureau representative
be present during the interview. The topic of the interview
was to have been their dufies and responsibilities during
the period of July to September, 1964, in connection with the
Democratic National Convention, Atlantic City, New Jersey. .
Ultimately, neither the Department nor the White House could Ww
reach agreement concerning the interviews and the employees Ly
did not submit to interview.

On June 3, 1975, Michael Epstein, staff member
of captioned Committee again requested these employees be
made available for interview on June 5, 1975, at 10:00 a.m.
The scope of the interview would be the responsibilities and
duties performed during the period of July to September, 1964,
in connection with the Democratic National Convention in
Atlantic City, New Jersey.

Memo from Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
SENSTUDY 75

Mr. Epstein classified the interview as an "abuse"!
type and agreed to allow agents to be available but not present
during interview.

On dune 3, 1975, K. William O'Conngr, Special Counsel
to the Deputy Attorney General for Intelligence Coordination,
was advised of the request and of the fact that an agent could
not be present during interview. He stated that the Department's
position was that unless the Committee consented to allow Bureau
personnel to be present, the interview would not go forth, and
that he would advise Epstein and F. A. 0. Shwartz, Chief Counsel
of the Committee, of this d@cision.

Mr. O'Conner telephonically recontacted Special Agent
Daly and advised that he discussed the matter with assistant
to the Counsel bo the President, James A. Wilderotter.
Wilderotter told O'Conner it was the White House position that
these girls should not be made available for interview unless
the Committee allows Bureau personnel to be present. Wilderotter
stated these two employees had been cited as examples wherein
the White House felt interviews should not be conducted without
representatives of the particular agency or Bureau being present
as they are service personnel. According to Wilderotter, Shwaréz
agreed to this position.

O'Conner telephonically contacted Special Agent Daly
on June 4, 1975, at which time he advised that he had discussed
the interview with Shwargz, Epstein, and staff member Mark
Gitenstein, and they would hold in abeyance the request to
interview the employees pending a review of documents the Bureau
is making available.concerning 1964 a ntic City Convention as
stated in the Committees request of we 14, 1975.

P. 0. Box 1033

Berkeley, California 94704

Dear Mr. Jones:

As you are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the nature of the
Bureau's involvement in local law enforcement affairs. This concern has been
heightened by my appointment to the House Select Committee to Investigate the
U. S. Intelligence Community. In this light, I am requesting answers to the
following questions concerning FBI activity in Berkeley:

1. What is the size of the contingent of agents in the Berkeley field office?

2. What are the functional responsibilities in the field office, and what are
the percentages of agents involved in each, i.e., political, drug abuse,
criminal, etc.?

3. What are the titles of the agents, and how do these relate to their
involvement in category two?

Dear Gongressman Dellums:

This is in response te your letter dated
May 28, 1975, sent to the Seniox Resident Agent
of the Berkeley, California, FBI Resident Agency.

To clarify your inquiries, it should be noted
the Resident Agency at Berkeley, California, operates
under the general supervision of the FBI's
San Franciseo Office.

There are currently nineteen Special Agents
assigned to the Berkeley Resident Agency. All are white
males. The function of a resident agency is to handle
| all FSI matters within its specific geographical
territory, This tneludes crininal, security and
‘| applicant investigations. The FBI docs not have primary

jurisdiction regarding drug matters and docs not
eonduct “political” investigations.

Ag a matter of policy, the FBI advises other

jurisdiction of those agencies. In seme cases there is
concurrent jGrisdiction and a joint investigation nay
be conducted; however, local law enforcement agencies
do not have access to FBI files. Representatives
of private security agencies may be contacted fron

Honorable Ronald V. Dellums

As I have already indicated, the FBI does not
conduct "political" investigations, nor do we conduct
"political surveillances." We do, of course, have a
responsibility for conducting domestic intelligence
investigations authorized under legislative enactments,
Presidential Directives and instructions of the
Attorney General. These matters relate to espionage,
sabotage, treason, sedition, and other activities
involving the internal security of the United States.
The policies relating to such investigations are
not made on an ad hoc basis by individual
Agents or individual offices, but conform with broad
policy applicable to all offices.

The FBI offers a variety of courses of
instruction for law enforcement personnel throughout
the United States, including such subjects as
anti-sniper and survival training and special weapons and
tactics, commonly known as "SWAT", The basic purpose
of this training is to provide well prepared
teams capable of resolving highly dangerous situations
with a minimum of risk to innocent bystanders, the Law
enforcement personnel involved and the subjects of the
investigation.

Enclosed is a newsclipping describing some
of the training of our own personnel in this field.
The article appeared on June 1, 1975, in the
“Washington Star News."

Sincerely yours,
G. BML Motta

that the draft be revised in order to recognize the need for certain

By referenced memorandum dated 3/12/75, Legal Counsel
recommended that the Intelligence Division (INTD) discuss with
representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other !
members of the intelligence community procedures for clearing
staff members of captioned committees for access to classified
information when questions as to the individual's trustworthiness
have arisen in the course of the FBI's background investigation. Ea
Following such discussions, Legal Counsel recommended that a
Memorandum of Understanding concerning these matters be prepared
by the INTD which might be used by both Senate and House U/

SS,

Committees,

By memorandum 3/25/75, the INTD submitted for approval
a draft of a proposed Memorandum of Understanding concerning
clearance procedures for staff members of captioned committees.
Special Investigative Division disagreed with several features
of our draft memorandum and has prepared a revised memorandum,
which is attached for approval.

UNRECORDED COBX EER ES

The INTD has coordinated this matter with the Special
Investigative Division and interposes no objection to the text
of the revised memorandum; however, it is suggested that considera-
tion be given to adding the words "by the FBI" at the end of
paragraph five on page one. Paragraph five, thus modified, would
read: "Where there is a question of trustworthiness for access
to classified information, the Committee Chairman will have the
summary memorandum ‘furnished to the Director of Central
Intelligence (DCI) by the FBI,"

= Mr. Adams memorandum to Mr. Callahan dated 3/7/75,
captioned as abéve, copy attached, reported our conversation with
Senator Church and Congressman Nedzi.

As indicated in Mr. Adams' memorandum, Congressman
Nedzi asked that we »prepare a memorandum of understanding to be
approved by CIA, FEI, and the House Committee concerning
investigative and clearance procedures for members of the Committee's
staff. It appeared appropriate to us to coordinate a memorandum
of understanding to be drafted for the House Committee with that to be
drafted for the Senate Cemmittee. Therefore, following our return from &
the meeting with Senator Church and Congressman Nedzi, I called Bill
Miller and advised him of the request made by Congressman Nedzi for us
to prepare a proposed memorandum of understanding. I asked him whether
it would be possible for us to coordinate the language of that memorandum
with the understanding that it will be drafted for use by the CIA, obher i
members of the intelligence community, and the Church Committee. Mr. %
Miller said that the proposal to coordinate the memorandum was completelsg
acceptable to him and he requested that the draft memorandum being q

On 3/7/75 Mr. Mintz and I called on Senator Church and his
staff director, Bill Miller, to further discuss the procedures for
investigating and clearing staff employéés ‘of the Cotfimittée, particularly
wheré information might be developed raising a quéstion as to the propriety
ofaclearance. It had previously béen approved that the FBI would conduct
the background investigations, furnishing the results to Senator Church,
and after his determination that the individuals met the required criteria

% for access to classified information he would notify CIA of his determination
g and intent to employ the individual involved, at which time CIA would grant
S the necessary clearance based on the certification by Senator Church.

. In discussions between CIA and FBI representatives, we raised

Zz the question as to whether CIA would review the results of the investigation
ae prior to granting clearances and CIA representatives indicated they did

3 not intend to and were reluctant to inquire of Senator Church as to whether
nN they could be furnished the results of any investigations involving derogatory

information.

3 In discussing‘this matter with Senator Church, I inquired whether
ay he had any objection to our bringing to the attention of CIA any questionable

eases in order that CIA representatives, who have the responsibility of
granting the actual clearances, would be in a position to advise and counsel
with Senator Church on those individual cases. He had absolutely no objection
to this and, in fact, felt there should be an open communication between

FBI, CIA and his Committee to insure that no one was appointed and cleared
who did not measure up in every respect from a security standpoint.

Memorandum for Mr. Callahan
Re: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

formerly employed by CIA and resigned in December, 1974, after his
clearance for sensitive compartmented information had been lifted as a
result of his marrying an alien. This marriage would not preclude him
from clearance for access to lesser degrees of sensitive material but

only for the more sophisticated clearances. Mr. Miller advised that Sloan
had not been appointed and was not going to be appointed because of other
reasons unrelated to a security clearance.

Senator Church indicated that he felt it would be wise to prepare
a memorandum outlining our security clearance procedures and his staff
would be glad to prepare such a document.

Following the meeting with Senator Church, Mr. Mintz and I
dropped by to see Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the House Committee,
and delivered to him Mr. Kelley's letter congratulating him and offering
him our complete cooperation. Chairman Nedzi stated that he was very
fappreciative of this offer and would consider Mr. Kelley's request to confer
with him as an open invitation and as soon as things had shaken down he would
be in touch with us.

We discussed with him the investigative and clearance procedures
we were following with the Senate Committee and Chairman Nedzi agreed
the same procedures should be followed with his Committee, including our
making available to CIA any derogatory information which might be pertinent to
a clearance determination. At first, he suggested that we send the results
of our investigations to CIA before coming to the Committee but then
concluded that it would be more appropriate for them to come to him first
since some of the applicants under consideration would probably not be 7
appointed. He specifically asked that we prepare a memorandum of under- i
standing to be approved by CIA, FBI and himself.

Iasked Mr. Nedzi whether he felt the formulation of his Committee
would serve to trim down the number of requests for information being received
from various House committees and it was his opinion that if would help in
some instances; however, in others committee chairmen would pursue their
own inquiries. He personally did not feel he had the clout nor the desire to
try to preempt this area entirely for his Committee. He also stated he
felt that CIA's problems had in the main been fully exposed and would soon be

of less concern, whereas the concern over domestic security policies of
the FBI would undoubtedly be greater in the future. He expressed his
appreciation for our cooperation and indicated he was striving for a
responsible approach to the inquiry.

Following the meeting with Mr. Nedzi, Mr. Mintz and I agreed
that it would be best for us to prepare a proposed memorandum of under -
standing concerning the investigative and clearance procedures for both | |
Committees in order to try to insure uniformity, and Mr. Mintz will get
in touch with Bill Miller to seek his concurrence in that regard. Our efforts
will be coordinated with CIA and the proposed memoraridum as drawn up
will be submitted for the Director's approval.

Bureau by other Government agencies and/or foreign intelligence sources

or adversely affecting an ongoing investigation. It was pointed out to

Mr. Nichols that if he so desires, he could, of course, obtain the services

of private counsel. He indicated it was his intention to arrive in

Washington Thursday night, 5-29-75. He was requested to appear in

the Office of Legal Analysis, Room 4513, at approximately 8:15 a.m.

on the morning of 5-30-75 so that arrangements might be made to brief him by

On May 27, 1975, James A. Wilderotter, Associate pen
to the President, requested me and representatives of other agencies interested
in the arrangements concerning interviews of witnesses by the Senate Select
| Committee to confer with him and Roderick Hills at 2:30 p.m. that date
| at the White House. Mr. K. William O'Connor, Deputy Assistant Attorney
: General, Inspector John B. Hotis and I represented the Department and the
H FBI. Roderick Hills and James A. Wilderotter represented the President's
i counsel; Bob Andrews represented the Defense Department; John Warner,
General Counsel, CIA; Roy Banner, General Counsel of NSA, and Mr. Hyland
from State Department as well oc Deputy to the Director of
CIA, attended. :

JFK Act 6 (1) (B)

The purpose ¢ of the meeting was to discuss the | latest v version of
proposed procedurés 1 to be e Followed by the Committee ‘staff investigators
during interviews of former and curr - employees. ‘Roderick Hills presented a
document (copy attached) which he described as a counteroffer by Frederick ud
Schwarz, Counsel to the Committee. He called for general discussion of the Wee
document after indicating that he had discussed this matter with Mr. Schwarz
at lunch on May 27th and felt that it was a workable document. I pointed out to
Mr. Hills that the document provides that there would be notice to the agencies
of the identity of witnesses a: reasonable time prior to interviews or taking of
sworn testimony except where "the committee or its appropriate delegee"
determines that prior notice should not be given. I told him that I was concerned
that that provision would be used by the Committee staff to permit individual
staff investieor gi [ie make that determination and I was confident they would

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

Mr. Hills was reluctant to seek a modification of the language
indicating that he had an understanding with Mr. Schwarz that the authority
would be limited to the senior counsel and to members of the Committee.

I told Mr. Hills I would request that the language be modified in writing

so that the authority would be conferred on specific representatives of the
Committee to avoid having staff authority which I thought would be abused.
Mr. Hils finally agreed that the language would be modified so that the
authority would be available only to both Committee senior counsel and/or
a combination of senior counsel and a Committee member. Further, the
Janguage would be modified to require that the determination that an agency
would not be given prior notice of a pending witness interview would be
recorded in writing for the Committee's records.

Iasked Mr. Wilderotter and Mr. Hills whether this agreement
was to be made between the staff and the agencies or whether it in fact would be
accepted by the Committee. After some discussion, we were advised by
Mr. Hills and Mr. Wilderotter that the document would be submitted to the
full Committee for their approval and incorporated into the Committee's
records.

I pointed out that I believed it was necessary for the understanding
to be made between the Committee and the Executive in order for there to be
some basis for restraining Committee staff investigators who may not
be inclined to follow the rules.

Other proposed changes discussed would require the Committee
represatative to furnish to a witness a copy of the Committee's rules which
includes advice concerning the right to counsel and a copy of the proposed
guidelines for. witness interviews.

I recommended that the guidelines be expanded to address the
problem of existing secrecy agreements with former and present employees
and the procedural problem involved in Attorney General Order 501-73
which requires prior Departmental approval in order for a witness to
respond to a subpoena. As a result, Mr. Wilderotter advised on the
morning of May 28, 1975, that he would recommend the addition of a sentence
in the opening paragraph that would indicate the guidelines would not be
understood to impair the constitutional rights of individual witnesses, agency
agreements with employees or former employees, existing Departmental
orders or the Committee's own rules.

-2- CONTINUED - OVER



Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

Other minor changes were considered and an effort will be made
to correct the language so that the agencies will be obliged to make reasonable
efforts to comply with all Committee requests instead of being required to
furnish "all information” absolutely.

Mr. Wilderotter advised on the morning of May 28th that the
comments described above will be discussed with Frederick Schwarz in an
effort to finally resolve this matter.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

that for special reasons exceptions can be made in either case: i.e,
when good reason exists, endorsed by the Select Committee, agency
