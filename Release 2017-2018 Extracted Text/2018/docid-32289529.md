earning a living for his family since coming to the
United States a few months ago. She advised she would
like for her brother to obtain a job in Las Vegas or
some Latin American country where gambling is legal

but for this you need "connections". When asked whether
the subject could help her brother obtain employment,
she indicated she had already requested his help but

so far nothing had come of it.

MM 693-C advised on 7-11-62, that he had seen
subject in Miami around 7-1-62, and at that time the
subject complained about being under constant FBI
surveillance. Informant said the subject was seeking
advice as to what measures he could take to elude or
discourage the surveillances.. The informant advised
the only advice subject received was to photograph every
FBI agent he saw following him, the thought being that
such action on the part of the subject would discourage
the surveilling agents.

MM 609-C advised on 7-12-62, he had heard _
that several months ago TONY RANDAZZO was fronting for if
the subject in the Miami area in an attempt to get an
interest in a numbers and/or bookie operation. This isource
said he has heard nothing to indicate that the subject has
acquired any bookie or numbers activity in Miami.

Fort Lauderdale, on 7-17-62, advised that he was acquainted”
with the subject, having met him in Havana five or six years
ago. WINTERING admitted being involved in bookie operations
in the Miami area in the past but said he is not doing
anything at the present time. He advised that he has :
met with the subject on at least three occasions during ©
the past few months but said the reason for these meetings
was of a personal nature and would be of no interest to the
FBI.

WINTERING further advised that he does not believe
the subject is involved in any bookie operations in the
Miami area but said he knows nothing about bolita or

numbers and therefore could not say whether the subject
