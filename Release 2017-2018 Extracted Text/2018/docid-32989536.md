At 11:15 a.m. on November 12, 1975, Cartha DeLoach,

former Assistant to the Director, telephonically advised me that he

A

Senate Select Committee on November 11, 1975. He advised that he

was represented by Charles McNellis, an attorney in the Washington law

firm of Edward Morgan:

The testimony was recorded by a stenographer.

and principally dealt with general guidelines Mr. DeLoach used in briefing

various Attorneys General concerning FBI work. They also inquired

concerning the Counterintelligence Program in that they asked him if he

had ever briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the Counterintelligence Program.

Mr. DeLoach described that portion of the interview as a "political tug of..

war" in which Epstein attempted to have him say that Ramsey Clark had

not been briefed, and Boshong attempted to have him say that Ramse

Clark had been briefed.

In Cant

Mr. DeLoach said that he testified that he had briefed Ramsey

Clark regarding the Counterintelligence Program and also briefed Clark

regarding wiretaps and microphones at Clark's specific request. Mr. DeLoach

was asked whether he had written a memorandum regarding that briefing,

but he could not recall specifically whether the memorandum was prepared.

He did say that it was the practice for a memorandum to be prepared recounting

conversations with Department officials. The Committee representatives

then advised Mr. DeLoach that they had asked for such documentation from

the Bureau, but a memorandum indicating DeLoach had briefed Ramsey Clark

regarding the Counterintelligence Program was not received among the

documents furnished by the Bureau. Mr. DeLoach requested me to advise

the Bureau that inView if such a memorandum can be located, it should be

forwarded to the Committee

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. DeLoach was asked whether anyone from the Bureau had

alerted him to the possibility that he would be asked concerning briefing

Ramsey Clark and whether anyone had suggested to him what his response

should be. He denied that such was the case, but did say that he had

received a telephone call from Assistant Director Wannall asking him

the question whether DeLoach had briefed any Attorneys General regarding

the Counterintelligence Program.

Mr. DeLoach was requested by the Committee to return on

Tuesday, November 18, 1975, at 2:30 p.m. for additional interview at which

time the subject will be the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and

Martin Luther King.

Mr. DeLoach said that a Mr. Wallach of the Committee's

staff described a memorandum which he claimed that DeLoach had prepared

regarding Jack Anderson and the Warren Commission. Mr. DeLoach said

that he could not recall such amemorandum.

Mr. DeLoach requested that the Bureau make available a

Bureau representative for consultation at 2:30 p.m. on November 18, 1975.

Mr. DeLoach said he madethis request because he was uncertain as to the

scope of the testimony he might be asked to give regarding Martin Luther

King. In response to his question, I told Mr. De Loach that information

concerning certain confidential sources involved in the origination of ine

investigation of Martin Luther King has not been discussed with the

Committee staff, but limited discussion has been had with Chairman Frank

Church. I told Mr. DeLoach that inquiries concerning the informants involved

in the basic information in that case should not be answered due to the

sensitivity of the information.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That the Intelligence Division determine whether there is

a memorandum describing a briefing of Ramsey Clark by Mr. De Loach

concerning the Counterintelligence Program.

Vice President Spiro Agnow called. He said he wanted to talk i0

me about sorethlag to see whether I could be of some assiatance. Fe

said he was really concerned about the continuing indammatory pro

nouncements of Kalph De Abernathy. I commented that he a one 0l 10g

worst. The Vice President said he los seen some of the backyround material

on him and he knows what that is, but it is beyond the pale as far as executive

use is concerned. He said in view of what went on in Augusta and other places,

it is important to have the icformation that savolved around this; the involve-

ment of those people, what information we have, whether fleeing from looting

or what la going on

No asked i there la any informacion available.

I told him we are working on thee at the present time, both in

Augusta, Atlante, and Jackeon, where the rocent demonstrations heve taken

place. I said we have pretty well concluded our investigation at Sent State

Univereity as to the sbooting and, as almays happons, we found a considerable

amount of firearses in the dormitories and rooms of tbe students, whether they.

used them or not is a question, some sey there was sniping and some say there

was not. l said the same is true at Jackson an there ane allegations of ariping

at the troope before they tired and denials.

We are intorviewing all the indi

vicuals who had any knowledge, students, et cetera. I said the problem at

Kent was thoy closed the univorsity and the atudents departed for all parts of

the country, but we finished the prellminary report on that and will anish today

the final report on Kent, while at Atlanta, Augusta, and Jacison, le will probably

been blocking Highway No. 1 most every day. I said very fortunately:

they have arrested and charged three of the leaders fos the damage done

to the Administration Building when they went in the other night and broke

the furniture, et Catara.

The Vice President said what he wants to be able to do is bring

oat some tacts the media conveniently overlooked. I said they never give

the things that are being done constructively, many times by students, to

try to prevent this, but they emphasize all the things: these jeriss are doing.

The Vice President said he saw & picture about Auguste shoving

some of the Negroes jumping out of store windows with look and booty and

fleeing and you never hear suything about thee. fle said whatever i can give

hima that can ameliorate some of the impact; that he understande some oi

the very thrust of the newapaper articles is that a bunch of police snot down

six Negroes and what happenod before why did they shoot at them - not

just because they felt like killing people. I said they ware severely provoked

at Kent and we will finish Augusta, Atlanta, and Jackson this week.

I told the Vice President I was sending to him P'ednesday, the

material Kent Crane asised for, which gives in summary the material we

have sent in detail.

The Vice President said he thought he was going to bave to start

destroying Abernathy's credibility, so anything I can give him would be

appreciated. I told him I would be glad to. I said I was the only one who

spoke out against wartin Lither Ying and I got hell, but I did not gire a daman

because it is more like bouquets than brickbats from some people. The

Vice President said we can't let demagogues become martyrs and heroes.

I said I had briefed the Appropriations Committee about his (Sing's) back-

ground and it has been affective recently because they have been trying

The Vice Preaident said he would like to be thoroughly conversant

The Pittsburgh "Point," a weekly newspaper

DI. RALPH ABERNATHY Will speak at a mass rally at Central

Baptist Church,- Pittsburgh, Pa., on 11/2/68, as part of a

drive by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCLC) • to educate Black communities concerning the three t

71965 edition of the "Herald," 407 Butler Street, Anderson,

S. C., South Carolina's oldest Negro newspaper, contains

the testimony of a 15 year old female member of ABERNATHY'S

church.

The testimony relates to a filthy and perverted

sex scandal between ABERNATHY and the girl according to

the Congressional Record. It is believed that if information

relating to this sordid episode on the part of ABERNATHY

were made public in Pittsbusgh, his effectiveness would be

curtailed.

It is felt that the mailing of these copies of the

Congressional Record fron Pittsburgh to the people suggested in

referenced airtel would be more effective than a mailing of the

Herald newspaper from South Carolina. There would be less

chance the information would be discounted as a Klan trick if the

information was received from fittsburgh in a way to indicate a

meniber of the local community sent it. Also the same page in

the Herald contains an article condemning lartin Luther King, Jx.,

and accusing hin of traveling to Puerto Rico with a young girl.

If the paper were used, this inforation on king would only serve

to "muddy the water,"

and make less effective the infornation on

For your information the edition of the

the Congressional Record.

NOTE:

Ralph Abernathy, President of the SCLC, is to speak at

a Pittsburgh Church on 11/2/68 to educate the black community

on the elections. Pittsburgh suggested that the Herald,

reportedly a South Carolina newspaper, be sent to the minister

aid Chairman of Deacons of the Church prior to Abernathy's

appearance.

The paper contains an article about a sex scandal

involving Abernathy and a 15-year-old girl. The Congressional

Record also contains information about this scandal.

COINTELPROS

This is to advise of information furnished to the Senate

Select Committee (SSC) on 11/13/75, documenting information previ

ously provided to the Committee indicating our Cointelpro efforts had

phased down prior to formal discontinuance of the programs on 4/28/71.

On 11/7/75,

Barbara Banoff of the SSC staff advised the

Committee had reviewed the exhibits in the Petersen Report on FBI

Cointelpros in an effort to determine if Cointelpro actions had been

phased down as indicated by SA David Ryan in his deposition to the

Committee in 10/75.

Banoff stated SSC staff members had reviewed

all proposals for Cointelpro action in the Communist Party and New

Left programs, as reported in the Petersen Committee Report exhibits,

and these verified the fact these two programs had been considerably

phased down prior to 4/71. She stated the Petersen Report exhibits

did not list the dates of activities for proposals in the Black Nation-

alist, White Hate, and Socialist Workers Party programs and

requested this be furnished to the Committee. According to Banoff,

this information would be broken down for each of the five programs

to show how many actions were instituted in each quarterly period

during the life of the individual programs, and that a chart would be

prepared for the Committee's use.

After obtaining information from the IS-1 and the IS-2

Sections (enclosed), the requested data for the additional three programs

was furnished to Banoff on 11/13/75.

These charts do indicate the

programs had phased down considerably prior to their formal termi-

nation in 1971.

ACTION:

None. For information.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20220

November 19, 19.75

Dear Mr.

Elliff:

This refers to your request for information

concerning participation by the Customs Service in

a covert foreign intelligence operation of the FBI

which relates. to "denied areas" immigrants to the

of origin or to some other

stand from our conversation that the intelligence

manual of the FBI refers to a procedure in which

the FBI would request Customs officials to examine

or to facilitate the FBI inspection of the outgoing

baggage of such individuals.'. This appears to be a

clandestine effort to determine if such "defecting

emigrants!' are transporting the products or other

evidence of espionage or if they are being coerced

into leaving the United States. :

As I mentioned in our brief telephone conver-

sation yesterday, Customs has advised me that it

has no program for assisting the FBI in the in-

spection of outgoing baggage and has not been

approached, at the Headquarters level,. for this

type of assistance.

Its concern is with incoming

baggage, and Customs doubts that it could segregate

a particular individual's outgoing bag for inspection.

The Customs Service acknowledges that an FBI

request for assistance could have been made with an

individual Customs official at the local office

A.72. What is the authority and procedure for inspections on behalf of

another agency such as CIA, FBI, DEA, IRS, Postal Service, and Internal

Security Division?

The US Customs Service has the authority under 19 U.S.C. 1499 to

examine all merchandise arriving in the United States.

We believe this

authority encompasses and authorizes Customs to conduct inspections at

the request of the ClA, since the statute states that imported merchan-

dise "shall not be delivered from Customs custody, except under such

bond or other security as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the

Treasury to assure compliance with all applicable laws, regulations

and instructions which the Secretary of the Treasury or the Customs

Service is authorized to enforce

•" 50 U.S.C. 403 authorizes

Federal agencies to cooperate with the CIA. There are no established

procedures for Customs inspections carried on at the behest of the

CIA. Any request would be handled on a case by case basis.

The language of 19 U.S.C. 1499 as cited above may also, in our opinion,

be potentially applicable in connection with the FBI examination of

imported shipments. We are unaware of any established procedure for

Customs inspections carried on at the behest of the FBI. Any request

would be handled on a case by case basis.

The US Customs Service shares with DEA enforcement responsibility

respecting certain controlled substances the importation of which is

prohibited by 21 U.S.G. 952. 19 U.S.C. 482 and 1582 provide the

authority for the Customs search of persons and baggage. Final

operating procedures between DEA and Customs have never

been formalized.

Attachment A is the interim Customs-DEA operating procedures issued by

the US Customs Service, Attachment B is the interim Customs-DEA opera

tion procedures issued by DEA.

Customs assists IRS in enforcing the Currency and Foreign Transactions

Reporting Act, 31 U.S.C. 1051 et seg

The Treasury Department

Regulations issued to implement 3T .U.S.C. 1057 ét seq., Part 103

of Title 31 CrR, require that reports be filed with the Commissioner

of Customs by individuals engaged in transporting currency or other

monetary instruments in excess of $5,000. These reports must be filed

upon entry into or departure from the United States of such an individual.

The provisions of 19 U.S. 6. 482 and 1582 are used to search persons

and baggage arriving from foreign countries in order to ascertain

compliance with many Federal and state laws of which The Currency and

Foreign Transactions Reporting Act is one.

Interview of Donald E. Moore by Mr. James Dick

of the Senate Select Committee Staff

After being sworn by Senator Huddleston, I was interviewed

under oath by Mr. James Dick in the Old Carroll Arms Hotel on

1 October 1975.

The interview started at approximately 1020 hours

and lasted until 1345.

During the interview I was shown numerous Bureau documents

and asked questions about them.

Some of the meetings described in

the. documents I had no recollection about but I answered all the

questions to the best of my ability.

I said that Mr. Hoover had personally approved the various

mail programs. On some memoranda whici did not go to Mr. Hoover's

office and were signed off by Mr. Belmont I said I thought this was

because Mr. Hoover had approved the program either orally or in a

prior memorandum and therefore I thought Mr. Belmont did not send

the subsequent memorandum in to Mr: Hoover.

I was asked if any Attorney General ever was informed of the

mail program and I advised that the only one I personally knew was

advised was Attorney General Katzenback. I explained that sometime

in 1965 I received a phone call from Mr. Belmont on a Saturday

morning and he asked me to come to his office as we needed to see

the Attorney General with regard to some testimony the previous

day before a subcommittee chaired by Senator Long of Missouri.

Mr. Belmont, in his office, advised me that Chief Postal Inspector

Henry Montague had appeared before the Long Committee and had

been told before his testimony not to answer any questions that might

relate to national security matters. When he was asked whether

mail ever left the custody of the Post Office Department he answered

no as he believed to decline to answer would be tantamount to a yes

and could affeci national security. Mr. Belmont talked to Mr. Tolson

by phone and thereafter we met the Attorney General in his office.

Courtney Evans, former Bureau Assistant Director and then a

Special Assistant to the AG, was also present but Mr. Dick did not

ask me who was present and I did not volunteer Courtney's name.

Either Mr. Montague had contacted the AG or Mr. Belmont had

mentioned the matter to him for as I recall the AG was aware of the

problems when we arrived. After discussing the matter, as I

recal' the AG said he would try to see Senator Long to get the

matter resolved. Mr. Dick asked if we told the AG we were

opening the mail we received from the Post Office and I said I

could not specifically recall this. He asked if we would have advised

the AG if he had asked and I said yes. As to whether I learned later

if the AG ever discussed this with Mr. Hoover and if we were advised

to discontinue I said I knew of no such discussion, if one took place,

and we were not told by Mr. Hoover to discontinue until mid-1966.

I also dir! not know if the AG saw Senator Long.

Mr.

Dick asked about the Baltch case and if I had informed

former Assistant Attorney General Yeagley about mail intercepts

in the case and I said I had. He asked if Mi. Yeagley had informed

the Attorney General and I said I did not know but I believe that

Attorney General Kennedy was advised by the Bureau later. As I

recall when trial started the US Attorney had made a statement that

required the government to either amend the statement or drop the

case and after Courtney Evans, then still in the Bureau, had advised

the AG of the mail intercept the AG decided the case should be

dropped. Mr. Dick asked if I was aware of a briefing Attorney

General Kennedy received in the New York office and if I knew

whether the mail programs were discussed. I said I remembered

the briefing, understood it was very comprehensive, but I do not

know if it covered the mail programs.

Mr. Dick asked if I knew whether any other Attorneys General

had been advised of the Bureau's mail programs and I said I did not

know of any. I also did not know of any Postmaster General who had

been advised, or Presidents.

With regard to the Hunter Project I said I had been aware

of it from the time the FBI started receiving material from it.

I could not recall how we were first advised but I believe either

the Post Office suggested we go to CIA or the Post Office went to

CIA and suggested we be advised. He asked if Mr. Hoover was aware

of it and I said he was.

Mr. Dick asked me various questions about my contacts

with Mr. Montague, several of which were set forth in the various

Bureau memoranda I was shown. With regard to the institution of

Z, coverage in New York City he asked me if we first made contact

with the Chief Postal Inspector her: and I said we did. He asked

who contacted him and I said I believed Mi. Boardman contacted

Mr. Stephens who was then the Chief Postal Inspector. Mr. Dick

asked if I had ever contacied Mr. Stephens and I said to the best

of my recollection I had never met him and was quite sure I had

not contacted him on any mail program. In response to a question

as to whether I had ever advised Mr. Montague the FBI opened mail

received from the Post Office I said I had not.

I advised Mr. Dick I knew of no mail intercepts by the FBI

after 1966 and was quite sure there had beer none.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

(FBI) SPECIAL AGENT HOMER W. SCHWEPPE BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER JAMES DICK

On September 23, 1975, after a short orientatio

U.S: SSC ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

SEPTET

Dick's initial inquiry was directed to the extent

of Schweppe's knowledge of the "Hunter Project."

When

Schweppe conceded he was not fimiliar with the term, Dick

oifered as an exhibit for review a copy of a rebruary 6,

1958, memorandum directed to Director Hoover entitled "ilunter

Project."

This memorandum outlined arrangements to be

elfected between the FBI and the Central Intelligence Agency

(CIA) regarding the manner in which the FBI would be provided

the results of CIA's monitoring of certain overseas mail.

On review of the document, Schweppe stated he was certain

he had nover seen that meno, but he acknowledged that on

the basis of the meno he had

a recolloction about such

activity by the CIA. Schweppe recalled that at some point

prior to his transfer from FBIHe in lay, 1958,

and he

indicated he felt it must have been earlier than the

February 8, 1958, date indicated above, he had pass across

his desk in the normal flow of official mail what he referred

to as the modern day version of computer printout lists

consisting, to the best of his recollection, of names of

what were

presumed to be Soviet residents as

in the Soviet Union.

Schweppe indicated that he had seen

• several such lists

but since they did not seem applicable

to the type of

cases being supervised by Schweppe at the

time, he paid them little hoed. He recalled that at least

some of the later printouts thore were instructions

accompanying theprintouts to the effect that names and/or

addresses of interest should be flagged for what was

presumed to be a "watch list" of

some sort.

Dick asked specifically whon Schweppe first

became avare of the lists montioned above; whether he was

familiar with FBI Form 5-38

1100110 12n

a form prepared for placing

a request on the

"watch list";

whether he had seen any of

the results of the CIA monitoring; und whether he had

CIA in

any reproduction of correspondence photosraphed by

connection with

"Ilunter Project.

U.S. SSC ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

STORET

Schweppe replied that he thought the lists

he mentioned earlier probably were seen by him before

February, 1958, but he acknowledged he could not recall

exactly when.

He said ho could not now recall ever haviug

seen FBI Form 5-88.

He replied that, since he felt he had

never placed a name or address on the "watch list," he

would not have any specific results routed to his personal

attention.

fe added, however, that if the results were

routed

to

all supervisors concerned with soviet intelligence

and reinted matters, he probably did see such results

and routinely initialed the accompanying routing slips.

He said he could recall no specific "CIA results" if, in

fact, he did see anything specific.

Dick asked whether Schweppe was aware of who

designated the routing of the lists he had seen, and

schweppe responded that he assumed ii was sone individual

in the office of the division's Assistant Director who

performed such an administrative function.

Schweppe said

not recall a Miss Triplett (phonetic), who,

according to Dick, was responsible for routing the

'Hunter

Project"

matorial

to appropriatc supervisors.

Schweppe

said he couid

have been included in such routing because

of his assignment.

Dick then queried Schweppe on his familiarity

with the term "Bureau Informant 200" (BI 200), when he

first became avare of the term, and whether he ever saw

any of the mterial attributed

to that informant. In

this connection Dick exhibited

another FBillO memo dated

February 6, 1959, which referred to BI 200 as the designation

used by

FBINQ to

forrard to its field offices infoimation

received fron

CIA under the "Hunter Project."

Schweppe

was unable to rconll exactly when he first became aware

of the use and identity of BI 200, but he assumed it was

early 1958.

He said he could recall seeing information

attributed to BI 200 both while at fBili@ and in Ho but

that he could no longer recall the specific nature of the

items involved.

He said he prosuned that all of them

dealt with-sovict-reinted investigatory matters.

schweppe

said he did not believe he has seon any refcrences to

BI 200 in the past 15 joars or so and that he may have seen

as many as five references a year before that.

Dick also queried Schweppe about his knowledge

of the "SAM Survey" (SAM) and "½ Coverage" (Z) •

asked Schweppe whether he knew when "SAM" and "z" were

initiated, what they consisted of, when they ceased,

when he first became aware of them, and whether he had seen

any results of those projects.

Schweppe replied that

" SAM" and

"Z" were on a need-to-know basis within

WFO but

that

he in time heard about them through office "shop

talk" and then concluded that those designations indicated

projects in which mail to and/or from the Soviet Union and

Soviet bloc countries was monitored.

He said he did

not know when those projects were initiated or when they

terminated.

He said that he would have to guess within a

tolerance of two or three years thât le first heard of those

projects in the early 1960s.

Schweppe said he was called

on from time to time to translate correspondonce in German,

which correspondence had been photographed by some source

not identified initially.

Schweppe suggested

that on later

inquiry

about the

source of the correspondence he was

informed it was either from "SAll" or "Z."

He said he was

unable to recall specifically who so advised him.

He felt

it was possible that word

was just "passed along" to that

effect. He could

not recall whether each specific individual

item was identified in a particular, special manner so as

to tio it in to its source.

Schweppe stated that he believes

all such material translated by him was directed to officials

at the Soviet and/or Soviet bloc embassies in lashington,

D. Co, and

not to any non-diplomatic personnel. Such

translation requirements were quite infrequent, and Schweppe

was not called on to translate any such material within

the past eight or ten years, to the best of his recollection.

Schweppe said it was his impression that "SA:"

in NeW YOik City

was handled in space at one

or the other

of New York's airports.

he said he was

unavare of the

specific arrangements in Washington, D. C.

He related

that

he was avare that FBI Spocial Agent John De Bettencourt,

since deconsed,

was directly involved in WFO's "Z Coverage"

project but that he did not know specifically to won De

Bettencouri was answerable.

Dick asked whether Schweppe was aware of any

mail having been opened by FBI employees in situations other

than the projects referred to above.

Schweppe, after making

the observation that Federal law and FBI regulations

prohibit such activity, said he himself had never opened

anyone's mail in his capacity as an FBI employee, that he

never obsorved any other FBI employee so engaged, and

he personally was not aware of any specific instances in

which that night have happened.

melated the eate newas sie to the los Angelen

Office,

he suspected that a female employee, whose name he

dould not recall, might possibly have

engaged

in the

surreptitious opening of other people's mail because of

the suspiciousnature of her actions at certain times.

Schweppe added

that these were suspicions raised by

circumstantial evidence only.

Dick then presented a hypothetical situation in

which agents on duty might obtain mail posted by

an

individual

and then proceed to open the same and review

the contents. le asked whether schweppe was aware of any

such instances.

Schweppe acknowledged that the suggested

scenario sounded realistic enough but added that he could

recall no such actual situations.

During the course of the interview, Schweppe

indicated that he had been assigued to Soviet-related

investigatory matters in WFO until early 1959, after

which he was assigned to the handling of German, Latin

American, Middle East, and Chinese investigatory matters

at different times.

Schweupe concluded by stating that his knowledge

and recollection of the subject matter constituting the

basis for the inquiry were reak.

he reiterated that he

never opened any other person's

mail in his capacity as an

FBI employce, that he never witnessed any other FBi employce

opening any such mail, and that he

cannot recall ever

being aware of any situation in

which mail was opened by

FBI employees, exclusive of the "SAl" and "z" projects

mentioned above.

This interview commenced about 10:15

September 23, 1975, and concluded at about 11:15 p.m.

However, review of numerous logical files failed

to locate any serials revealing a response to the

By memorandum from

later) regarding the status of

responses to the Ruckelshaus

inquiry, it was noted that response to questions two, eight,

and 10, while completed and ready for the Department, had

not been furnished to the Department. The memorandum is

apparently consistent with another earlier memorandum to

RE: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

CONCERNING NIR. LEON LETWIN

AND IIR. GEORGE B. BOWLES

Reference is made to the letter of the SSC dated

October 7, 1975, requesting delivery of FBI material pertaining to

reasons for the FBI's investigative interest in Ir. George B. Bowles

and Mr. Leon Letwin.

A thorough review of FBI files fails to disclose any

material which indicates the FBI had an investigative interest in

Mr. Bowles.

In accordance with this request, a memorandum,

appropriately excised, captioned "Leon Letwin," dated May 26,

1964, which sets forth reasons for the FBI's investigative interest

in Ir. Letwin is being delivered with this memorandum.

Attorney General Edward H. Levi

Department of Justice

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mr. Levi:

At the close of his testimony on September 25,

Mr. Charles Brennan, former Chief of Domestic Intelligence

Division, indicated

that he could not answer a question

posea to him by me.

The question relates to the status of

a so-called "closed" FBI

Domestic Intelligence cáse. file.

Suppose that the individual who is subject of the file is

member of the military service or

applies for employment

with a federal government agency, and the agency requests an

FBI name check.

What information would be provided to the

federal agency by the FBI as the result of that name check?

What information would be provided to that agency if the FBI

conducted a background investigation on that individual?

With respect to surreptitious entries for the pur-

pose of installing electronic surveillance equipment, which

are referred to on page three of the September 24, 1975 letter

from Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., to myself, I would appreciate

answers to the

following additional questions:

1. What has been the number of such entries for

each year since 1960?

2.

What has been the number of separate targets

for each year since 1960?

3.

What has been the total number of separate

targets since 1960?

10/71/75

I would also request access, under agreed upon pro-

cedures, to a list of such targets, and, the dates of the entries.

singenely,

VICK was friendly and afiable but businesslile

throughout the interview.

In a brief initial off-the-rocord

exchange, Dick explained

that he vas interested in SCiere's

knowlodge of the "Hunter Project." When SChwerst indicated

he was not familiar wich the term, DICK consulied his notos

to confirm whether scleope in fact was the party he intended

io interview. A check by hin corroborared that SChwarpo's

name had been provided him by the department of Justice

as an individual with knowledge of "Hunter" and relaied

projects.

During this initini exchange, sCHiePs indicated

that his recollection oi specifics such as "exactly when"

"Did you ever sec?"

"Then did you firsi see ni learn?"

or "How many tines did you see?" based on material possibly

soen by him over a period of several monihs as far back:

as 1958 was limited. DICK agreed and suggested that there

really might be no need to continue the interviev, but in

the end he suggested that since all partics were in place,

the interiogation might as vell proceed. /

He indicated that a transcript of the interview

would be available for review

by SCHwerpe in about a week.

DICK said he would contact sA DALY at felld at the

appropriate time.

On contact on 9/30/75, DICK said the

ixanscript probably vould be available for revier in about

a week. As of 10/15/75, it had not been made available.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE:

INTERVIEW OF FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

(FBI) SPECIAL AGENT HOMER W. SCHWEPPE BY

SSC STAFF MEMBER JAMES DICK

On September 23, 1975, after a short orientation

discussion and after advising him of his rights under the

Constitution and

reminding him that his appearance was

voluntary, SSC Staff Member James Dick interviewed FBI

Special Agent Homer W. Schweppe in the presence of SSC

stenotypist Susan Hanback regarding his knowledge of

the following:

The "Hunter Project," "Bureau Informant

200," "the SAM Survey,

•" "Z Coverage," and opening of mail

by FBI employees.

At the outset Dick asked Schweppe to document his

FBI service.

Assignments

Schweppe responded by listing the following:

in San Francisco from late 1946 to mid-1947;

in Los Angeles from mid-1947 to mid-1951; at FBI Headquarters

(FBIHQ) from May, 1951, to May, 1958, and again from late

1960 to November, 1961; in the

Washington Field Office (WFO)

of the FBI from May, 1958, on, except for the 1960 to 1961

period just cited.

During the course of the interview Schweppe was

also asked to indicate the nature of his assignments at

FBIHQ. He indicated he was assigned for the main part to

units

within the Domestic Intelligence Division dealing

with Soviet military

attache personnel and with members

of Elizabeth Bentley's "espionage ring."

his desk in the normal flow of official mall what he referred

to as the modern day version of computer printout lists

consisting, to the best of his recollection, of names of

what were presumed to be Soviet residents as well as' addresses

in the Soviet Union. Schweppe indicated that he had seen

several such lists but since they did not seem applicable

to the type of cases being supervised by Schweppe

at the

time, he paid them little heed. He recalled that at least

with

some of the later printouts there were instructions

accompanying theprintouts to the effect that names and/or

presumed to be a "watch list" of some sort.

Schweppe replied that he thought the lists

February, 1958, but he acknowledged he could not recali

He said he could not now recall ever having.

He replied that, since he felt he had

address on the

"watch list," he

would not have

any specific results routed to his personal

attention.

he added, however, that it the results were

routed to all supervisors concerned with soviet intelligence

and related matters,

he probably did see such results

and routinely initialed the accompanying routing slips.

He said. he could recall no specific

resülts" 1f; in

fact, he did see anything specific.

Dick asked whether Schweppe was aware of who

designated the routing of the lists he had seen, and

Schweppe responded. that he assumed it was some individual

in the office of the division's Assistant Director who

performed such an administrative function. Schweppe said

he did not recall & Miss Triplett (phonetic), who,

according to Dick, was responsible for routing the "Hunter

Project" material

to appropriate supervisors.

Schweppe

said he could have been included in such routing because

of his assigment.

Dick then queried Schweppe on his familiarity

Dick also queried Schweppe about his knowledge

Schweppe said he was called

on from time to time to translate correspondence in terman,

which correspondence had been photographed by

some source

Schweppe suggested that on later

inquiry about the

source of the correspondence he was

informed it was either from "SAM" or "Z."

said he was

unable to recall specifically who so advised him.

He felt

it was possible that word was just "passed along" to that

effect. He could not recall whether each specific individual

Item was identified in a particular, special manner so as

to tie it in to its source:

Schweppe stated that he believes

all such material translated by him was directed to officials

D: C., and

I not to any non-diplomatic persounel. Such

translation requirements were quite infrequent,

and schweppe

was not called on to translate

any such material within

the past eight or ten years, to the best of his recollection.

Schweppe said it was his impression that "sAM!

of New York's airports.. He said he was unaware of the

specific arrangements in Washington, D. C, He related that

he was aware that FBI Special Agent John De Bettencourt,

Dick asked whether Schweppe was aware of any

mail having been opened by "BI employees in situations other

than the projects referred

to above.

Schweppe, after making

the observation that Federal law and FBI regulations

prohibit such activity,: said he himself had never opened

anyone's mail in his capacity as an FBI employee, that he

never observed any other FBI employee so engaged, and that

he personally was not aware of any specific instances in

which that might have happened.

At this point Schweppe

related that while he was assigned to the los Angeles

Office, he suspected that a female employee, whose name he

could not recall, might possibly have

been engaged

in the

surreptitious opening of other people's mail because of

the

suspicious nature of her actions at certain times.

Schweppe added that these were suspicions raised by

circumstantial evidence only

Dick then presented a hypothetical situation in

which agents on duty might obtain mail posted by an

individual and then proceed to open the same and review

the contents. He askea whether.

Schweppe was aware of any

such instances. Schweppe acknowledged that the suggested

scenario sounded realistic enough but added that he could

recall no such actual situations.

During the course of the interview,

Schweppe

indicated that he had been assigned to Soviet-related

investigatory matters

in WFO until early 1959, after

which he was assigned

to the handling of German, Latin

American, Middle Fast, and Chinose investigatory matters

at different times,

Schweppe concluded by stating that his knowledge

FBI employee, that he never witnessed any other FBi employee

opening any such mail, and that he cannot recall ever

At this

First of all,

may I express my deepest sympathies

On my own behalf and as a representative of the

Committee, I also want to thank all the officials and

agents of

the FBI who have been so very helpful in the

Committee's work over the past months. I hesitate to

mention names, but we especially appreciate the time and

effort put in by Mr. Bill Cregar, Mr. Elmer Larsen,

and Mr. Paul Daly.

There is still a way to go before

we are done legislation But mine mode a eats

purposes of presentation. But the important thing is to

get the Congressional process moving. There may stiliAN 13 1976

be some tensions between the Committee and FBI repre-

sentatives on one problem or another.

Nevertheless,

I want you to understand that the Chairman and Vice-

Chairman are deeply interested in achieving our basic

legislative goal of clarifying

AN ANALYSIS OF FBI DOMESTIC SECURITY

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS: AUTHORITY,

OFFICIAL ATTITUDES, AND ACTIVITIES IN HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE:

A SYNOPSIS

Many persons who are currently examining the FBI's

domestic security intelligence authority and the parameters

of this jurisdiction begin their analysis at a mid-point in

the history of this Nation's struggle against the force of

subversion.

This approach tends to result in a mechanical

examination of the subject without the benefit of an under-

standing of the historical forces and necessities which

brought about the need to conduct domestic security intelli-

gence investigations. In an effort to clarify the role the

FBI has played in this field, it is deemed appropriate to

submit this concise review of historic events illustrating

the evolution of the problem of domestic subversion, atti-

tudes of Government officials towards the problem, and how,

against this historic backdrop, the FBI, came to be assigned

domestic security intelligence

responsibilities.

Many today assume incorrectly that the FBI commenced

domestic security intelligence investigations within the last

several years.

In fact, the Bureau of Investigation, the pred-

ecessor of the modern FBI, was given foreign and domestic

security responsibilities

during World War I (WWI), 1917-1918.

In 1917, Congress enacted the Selective Service

and Training Act,

the Espionage Act, and the Trading with the

Enemy Act, followed in 1918, by the

Sabotage and Deportation

Acts. Enforcement responsibilities for the most part fell on

the Bureau of Investigation.

During World War I there was at all times an

enormous overlapping of investigative activities among the

various agencies charged with the winning of the war.

There

were probably seven or eight such active organizations opera-

ting at full force during war days and it was not an uncommon

experience for an Agent of this Bureau to call upon an indi-

vidual in the course of his investigation, to find out that six

or seven other Government agents representing as many other

investigative agencies had been around to interview the party

about the

same matter.

NY 55079 DooId: 32989536 Page 171

## Page 172

In an effort to counter the radicals and anarchists,

the Department and Bureau, in conjunction with the Department

of Labor, which had primary jurisdiction over immigration

matters, used the provisions of the "Deportation Statute" as

an answer.

•In 1919, J. Edgar Hoover, a Departmental Attorney

since 1917, was placed in charge of the General Intelligence

Division, Department of Justice.

The Division had the respon-

sibility of correlating information obtained by the Bureau for

the purpose of preparing material for deportation proceedings.

As a Departmental Attorney, Mr. Hoover not only observed the

wartime problems but experienced the difficulties associated with

intelligence-type investigations while with the Division:

On October 5, 1920, he prepared a report on the

General Intelligence Division and stated very clearly that

information which the Bureau was collecting was being used

by the General Intelligence Division of the Department of

Justice as pure and valuable intelligence information to assess

internal domestic radical activity as early as 1919.

In 1924, Harlan Fiske Stone was appointed Attorney

General of the United States, and his concept as to the Bureau's

role was quite clear:

"The Bureau of Investigation is not concerned with

• political or other opinions of individuals.

It is

concerned only with such conduct as is forbidden by

the laws of the United States.

When a police system

goes beyond these limits it is dangerous to the

proper administration. of justice and to human

liberty...."

J. Edgar Hoover, who was appointed Director of the

Bureau of Investigation by Attorney General stone in 1924!

followed this policy from its inception.

To complete the picture of official FBI policy and

attitude regarding investigation of radical activities during

the 1920's and early 1930's, it must be noted that intelligence-

type investigations were conducted on a very limited basis and

for specific purposes when requested by the Attorney General

and Secretary of State under the provisions of the Appropriations

Act, 28 U.S.C. 533(3) .

- 2 -

NW 55079 DocId:32989536 Page 172

## Page 173

Though the Departmental and Bureau

policy from

1924 to 1934 was to not engage in general domestic security

intelligence investigations, the communist-anarchist problem

was ever present and of great concern to the public, the

Executive, and Congress.

The "red radicals" and

anarchists

were no longer alone in the field, however, for in the early

1930's, National Socialism, the Nazi party

ideology of

Adolf Hitler, grew to power in Germany and anti-Semitic, anti-

racial propaganda was being peddled by Nazi operatives, aliens

and pro-German Americans in the United States.

On May 8, 1934, Mr. Hoover appeared at a conference

at The White House attended by President Franklin D. Roosevelt,

the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Treasury, the

Secretary of Labor, and the Chief of the Secret Service." The

topic of concern was the Nazi movement in the United States. As

a result of the conference, Hoover recorded on May 10,1934:

18

...it is desired that a very careful

and searching investigation be made of this

movement, with particular attention to be

given to activities indicating that either

the German Embassy or the German Consulates

throughout the United States may have con-

nection with this movement.

"The investigation should be considered

as a so-called intelligence investigation,

that is to say, the reports should be pre-

pared in one general summary at specified

intervals in order that the Attorney General

may have them made available, and in turn

make them available to the President."

It is readily recognized that this Presidential in-

struction was not a sweeping and general assignment to conduct

domestic security intelligence investigations, but rather to

conduct an intelligence investigation within specified guide-

lines.

Nonetheless, here, based upon a Presidential Directive,

the Bureau departed

from past statutory policy and immediately

initiated an intelligence investigation, which by necessity,

involved aliens and United

States citizens and was conducted

Ior the primary purpose of intorming the Attorney General and

the President as to the general activities of the movement.

. - 3 -

NW 55079 DocId: 32989536 Page 173

## Page 174

This investigation of the Nazi movement, conducted

along the specified guidelines set by the President, was not

•expanded to include investigation of such communist or radical

movements whose purpose it was to overthrow the Government.

In a memorandum dated October 9, 1935, for the Acting Attorney

General, the Director noted in his response to a State

Department inquiry as to the feasibility of exchanging radi-

cal information with foreign police sources:

"At the present time the investigative

activity of this Bureau is restricted, in

matters of this kind (communist and radical

matters) to those activities which constitute

a violation of some Federal statute.

"Very little information is obtained by

this Bureau relating to the activities of these

radical organizations; which advocate the over-

throw of the United States Government.

It

follows, of course, that information of thia':

kind is of no value when existing laws do not

permit a prosecution of the persons engaged

in advocating the overthrow of the Government.

I will, however, be glad to receive at any

time, information from any foreign police

department, which pertains to organizations

established for the purpose of attempting to

overthrow this Government, and will in the

event the Bureau can take no

action upon the

information furnished transmit the information

to those Governmental agencies who may be

interested in the material obtained."

On August 24, 1936, Director Hoover, representing

the Department in the Attorney General's absence, was summoned

to The White House by President Roosevelt.

As reflected in two

memoranda by Mr. Hoover, dated August 24 and August 25, 1936,

the President "was desirous of discussing the question

of the

subversive activities in the United States, particularly

Fascism and Communism." Hoover recorded that the President

stated he had been concerned about the communist and fascist

movements and "what he was interested in was obtaining a broad

picture of the general movement and its activities

as may

affect the economic and political life of the country as a

whole."

- 4-

NW 55079 DocId: 32989536 Page

## Page 175

The President inquired what suggestions Hoover might offer

relative to this matter.

Hoover recorded that he responded

to the President as follows:

"I told him that the appropriation of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation contains a

provision that it might investigate any matters

referred to it by the Department of State and

that if the State Department should ask for i:

us to conduct such an investigation we could

do so under our present authority in the .

appropriation already. granted."

(Emphasis

Added)

..";

On careful reading, and examination in light of the

historic setting, it is apparent that the President and Hoover

were

talking about money, not jurisdictional limits.

The

President wanted a broad

intelligence investigation conducted

not for purposes of prosecution and inquired. of Hoover 1f the

FBI could supply the product.

the President that money had been appropriated by Congress

under the Appropriations Act and to activate the provisions

for justifiably using the funds would require a request from

the Secretary of State. The FBI could, of course, conduct no

investigations for which Congress had not provided appropriations.

The final topic discussed at the August 24, 1936, meeting was the

President's desire that Hoover coordinate the investigation with

the "Military and Naval Intelligence Services."

The entry of the Bureau into the new field of domestic

security intelligence investigations necessitated the creation

of administrative procedures to handle the incoming information.

By memorandum dated August 28, 1936, an assistant submitted a

tentative outline for the manner in

which it was recommended

information concerning subversive activities be maintained at

Headquarters. He outlined the following "general classifications":

Maritime Industry, Government affairs, steel industry, coal

and fur industry,

general strike activities,

industry, newspaper field, clothing, garmeducational institutions,

Armed Forces,

general activities--Communist and Affillated Organizations,

Fascisti, Anti-Fascisti movements, and

activities in Organized

Labor organizations. Mr. Hoover noted on the memorandum that.

this was a good beginning..

## Page 176

By letter of October 20, 1938, Attorney General

Homer Cummings forwarded to the President a memorandum from

Director Hoover wherein Hoover outlined for the President

the general scope of the FBI intelligence effort and the areas

of coverage being afforded.

"In order that there may be a clear view

of the detailed information covered, there is

set forth the following break-up of

the various

subjects that appear in the files of the

Intelligence Section; Maritime; government;

industry (steel, automobile, coal mining, and

miscellaneous); general strike; armed forces;

educational institutions; Fascisti;. Nazii.

organized labor; Negroes, youth; strikes;

newspaper field; and miscellaneous.. Any

information of a subversive or general intelli-

gence character pertaining to any of the above

is received at the FBI headquarters at the

Seat of Government and is reviewed, summarized,

and placed upon editorial cards which are

filed by name of the subject matter, as well as

by name of the individual, so that it is en-

tirely possible to find in the index the col-

lection of names of individuals engaged in any

particular activity, either in any section of

the country or in a particular industry

movement.

Indicative of the present size of

this index, there are approximately 2,500

names now in the index of the various types

of individuals engaged in activities of

Communism,

Nazism, and various types of foreign

espionage."

(Emphasis Added)

Additional legislation was apparently not deemed

necessary by officials of

the Department and the Bureau.

Attorney General Homer Cummings (1938) :

. "No additional legislation to accomplish the

general objectives seems to be reguired."

Former Director J. Edgar Hoover (1938):

"Such expansion in the FBI as may be desired

and may become necessary can be covered, it is

believed, under present provisions existing

in the annual appropriations bill of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation,.... • Under

this provision investigations have been

conducted in years past for the State

Department of matters which do not in

themselves constitute a specific violation

• of a Federal Criminal Statute, sụch as

subversive

activities.

Consequently, this

provision is believed to be sufficiently

broad to cover any expansion of the present

intelligence and counterespionage

work which

it may be deemed necessary to carry on."

Recommendations of Departmental and

Bureau officials in considering the necessity

for the issuance of a Presidential directive

(1939) :

"Formal order on the part of the

President would hardly be needed to accom-

plish this result"

(centralization of in-

vestigative responsibility.) "All that would

be required from him would be a letter to

each department head."

President Roosevelt, on November 2, 1938, personally

advised the former Director that he approved

of Hoover's plan,

thus confirming that there was a meeting of

the minds among

the primary participants.

The world situation steadily worsened during the

1930's. Amid this chaotic world situation the United States

attempted to stand neutral; nevertheless, the danger of potential

espionage, sabotage, and subversion was

of paramount concern.

assist their efforts, much reminiscent of the American Pro-

tective League and various ad hoc groups formed for the same

purpose during world War I.

In response to this growing problem,

the Bureau recommended remedial action through the Attorney

General which resulted in a letter dated February 7, 1939, being

directed to various Federal department heads from Joseph B.

Keenan, Assistant to the Attorney General, which stated in

part:

"I take pleasure in informing you that

in cooperation with the Military Intelligence

Division of the War Department, the Federal

Bureau of Investigation of the Department of

Justice has undertaken to investigate matters

relating to espionage and subversive activities.

"In order that such matters be handled

expeditiously, it will be appreciated if you

will instruct your personnel that in case any

information is received concerning the above-

mentioned matters such information should be

promptly forwarded to the nearest field office

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."

Here was a direct effort of the Department and the

FBI to prevent the confusion, delays, and violation of personal

rights incident to such investigations during the previous war.

Nevertheless, the letter of February 7, 1939, was

virtually ignored by other agencies, and a cumbersome committee

system, under the direction of the Undersecretary of State,

was inaugurated. The committee was composed of representatives

of the War, Navy, Treasury, Post Office, and Justice Departments,

in addition to the State Department, whose function it was to

receive information of a subversive nature, make an analysis,

and then forward the matter to the agency deemed most suited

handle the investigation.

The bulk of the matters were referred

to the FBI and the military and naval intelligence services.

The previous arrangement, based on the President's desires of

1936, was completely ignored, causing a waste of prior efforts

and accumulated information, delays in referral

general confusion.

of cases, and

The Department and Bureau prepared a memorandum dated

June 5, 1939, containing ideas and recommendations to be pre-

sented to the President in an effort to resolve the controversy.

"For the reasons outlined above it is

recommended that the definite steps be taken--

first, that the interdepartmental committee

described in the first paragraph of this memor-

andum be abandöned and that in its place the

investigation of all espionage, counter-espionage

and sabotage cases be controlled in the Intelli-

gence Divisions of the War and Navy Departments

- 8-

## Page 179

and the Federal Bureau of Investigation and that

"the directors of these three agencies function

in the capacity of a committee to coordinate the

activities of the three agencies named.

Second,

that confidential instructions should be issued

by the President to the heads of all government

departments except War, Navy, and Justice, in-

structing that absolutely no investigations shall

be conducted by the investigative agencies

of

those departments into cases involving actually

or potentially espionage, counter-espionage or

sabotage. • The heads of all government depart-

ments should be instructed in this order to

refer immediately through existing channels

direct to the nearest office of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation any data, information

or material pertaining to cases of this type.

Formal order on the part of the President

would hardly be needed in order to accomplish

this result. All that would be required from

him would be a letter to each department head."

This recommended procedure, concurred in by President

Roosevelt, resulted in the confidential Presidential Directive

of June 26, 1939, which reads:

"It is my desire that the investigation of

all espionage, counterespionage, and sabotage

matters be controlled and handled by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Jüstice

the Military Intelligence Division of the War

Department, and the Office of Naval Intelligence of

the Navy Department.

The directors of these three

agencies are to function as a committee to

coordinate their activities.

"No investigations should be conducted by

any investigative agency of the Government into

matters involving actually or potentially any

espionage, counterespionage, or sabotage, ex-

cept by the three agencies mentioned above.

"I shall be glad if you will instruct the

heads of all other investigative agencies than

the three named, to refer immediately to the

## Page 180

nearest office of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation any data, information, or

material that may come

to their notice

bearing directly or indirectly on espionage,

• counterespionage, or sabotage."

The overall problem was not, however, totally resolved

with the Directive of June 26, 1939. Reports were frequently

received in Washington indicating that various local police

authorities were forming "sabotage squads" and the like and!

therefore, further clarification was deemed necessary.

The Department and FBI again went to the President

to resolve the question.

At 6:20 piM. on September 6, 1939, the Attorney General

reached Mr. E. A. Tamm, Assistant Director, and advised him as

is reflected in Mr. Tamm's memorandum dated September 6, 1939.

"The Attorney General called and stated

that the President issued the order today. He

stated it reads, in part, as follows:

"President Roosevelt today requested all

local law enforcement officers to cooperate

with the FBI in the drive against espionage,

sabotage, subversive activities, and violation

of the neutrality laws.

Roosevelt issued

a formal statement requesting all police

officers, sheriffs, and other law enforcement

officers to transmit to the G-Men all infor-

mation bearing on

such cases.

This task

must be conducted in a comprehensive and

effective manner on a national basis and all

information must be carefully sifted out and

co-related in order. to avoid confusion and

irresponsibility.

To this end I request all

police oIlicers, sheritis, and all other law

enforcement officers in the United States

promptly to turn over to the nearest represent-

ative of the federal Bureau of Investigation

any

information obtained by them relating to

espionage, counter-espionage, sabotage, sub-

versive activities, and violation of the

neutrality laws."

The Presidential Directives of June 26 and September 6,

1939, were apparently not issued for the sole purpose of fully

describing the scope of FBI domestic and foreign security intelli-

gence investigative jurisdiction, but rather were issued to

place and finalize investigative authority in the FBI and the

military intelligence services over those areas of jurisdiction

where conflicts were developing. It should be noted, however,

the subject matter of the President's instructions regarding

domestic security intelligence investigations

of 1936, as Ie-

affirmed in 1938, is also addressed in the Directive of

September 6, 1939, thus tending to confirm the President's

intent that the FBI and military services handle all matters

relating to foreign and domestic security intelligence investi-

gations. To coordinate their efforts, the fBI and the military

intelligence services formed the Interdepartmental Intelligence

Conference (IIC).

The manner in which the FBI and the military intelli-

gence services delineated their respective responsibilities is

reflected in a series of Delimitations Agreements of June 5,

1940,

February 9, 1942, and February 23, 1949.

Each of these

Delimitations Agreements generally cites in the preamble that

in conformity with the Presidential Directive of

June 26,

1939,

as augmented by the Directive of September 6, 1939, investi-

gation of all "espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, and sub-

versive activities

(or subversion) will be delimited"

as

therein

described.

the Delimitations Agreements. of 1940, 1942, and 1949,

• stated that the FBI shall investigate those matters involving

citizens and foreign nationals or foreign-directed activity in

certain geographic areas, including the United States, and,

among other duties, shall advise the military of "cases of

actual or strongly presumptive espionage of sabotage, including

the names of individuals definitely known to be connected with

subversive activities" (1940 and 1942) or "developments con-

cerning the strength, composition, and intentions of civilian

groups within its cognizance which are classed as subversive and

whose activities are

a potential danger to the security of the

United States" (1949) •

The IIC as an independent committee ceased to exist

as, pursuant to the National security Act of 1947, which formed

absorbed and

chartered by the NSC, presided over by the President. The IIC

charter issued by NSC dated July 18, 1949, reads in part:

- 11 -

NW 55079 DooId: 32989536 Page 181

---

## Page 182

"Pursuant to the provisions of Section 101

of the National Security Act and NSC 17/4 as

approved by the President, the National Security

Council hereby authorizes and directs that the

Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference effect

the coordination of all investigation of domestic

espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, sub-

version, and other

related intelligence matters

affecting internal

security.

"(1) The Interdepartmental Intelligence

Conference shall be constituted as set forth in

the Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939,

that is, the Director of the Federal Bureau

. of

Investigation, the Director'

of the Intelligence:

Intelligence, and in addition, the Director,

Office of Special Investigations, U. S. Air

Force, which office has been created since the .

issuance of the original Presidential Directive.

"D. Nothing herein shall be construed as

modifying or affecting the Presidential

Directives issued to the members of

the

IIC

relating to their individual responsibilities

and duties. The Delimitations Agreement among

the members of the IIC relating to the investi-

gative responsibilities and duties of the in-

dividual members and other agreements among

these members relating to the same matters

shall remain in full force and effect and shall

continue to be amended, changed, and

supple-

mented at the discretion of the

IIC. "

Thus, it was reaffirmed on Presidential authority

through the charter of the. IIC- that the Presidential Directive

of June 26, 1939, as mentioned in the charter and the Delimi-

tations Agreement, and the Directive of September 6, 1939, as

contained in the Delimitations Agreement, were not to be

modified or affected and, through the agreement, were to remain

in full force and effect.

The Presidential intent has also been manifested and

reaffirmed through the issuance of subsequent Directives by

President Roosevelt on January 8, 1943, President Truman on

July 24, 1950, and President Eisenhower on December 15, 1953.

Such reissuances appear to occur to reinforce and remind in-

terested parties of this intent during

• times of national

peril--1943, during the height of WW II; 1950, during the

Korean conflict; and 1953, during the Cold war era and enact-

ment of the Atomic Energy Act.

On June 9, 1962, President John F. Kennedy executed

National Security Action Memorandum 161, wherein he stated in

part:

"2.

Accordingly, I have directed that the

two interdepartmental committees concerned

with internal security--the Interdepartmental

Intelligence Conference (IIC) and the Inter-

departmental Committee on Internal Security

(ICIS) --which have been under the supervision

of the National Security Council, will be

transferred to the supervision of the Attorney

General. The continuing need for these com-

mittees and their relationship to the Attorney

General will be matters for the Attorney General

to determine."

On March 5, 1964, the Attorney General directed a

charter to the IIC which is identical to the charter issued by

the NSC in 1949, save for the issuing authority being the

Attorney General in place of the NSC.

Since that time, the

FBI has operated in the field of foreign counterintelligence and

domestic security investigations under the overall supervision

of the Attorney General.

In addition to the reaffirmation of the Presidential

intent, the Attorney General has codified his instructions that

the FBI handle such matters in 28 CFR, Section 0.85 (a) ;

"Carry out the Presidential directive of

September 6, 1939, as reaffirmed by Presidential

directives of January 8, 1943, July 24, 1950,

and December 15, 1953, designating the (FBI) to

take charge of investigative work in matters re-

lating to espionage, sabotage, subversive activ-

ities, and related matters."

The FBI, in addition, is responsible for the investi-

gation of numerous Federal statutory violations, many inherently

addressing the field of domestic subversion and extremist

activities, as well as for retaining material and conducting

such investigations as are necessary and proper under the Federal

Employee Loyalty Program.

As has been illustrated, the FBI, since World War I,

has been the recognized Federal agency to conduct investigations

of a national security nature, and, since 1936, has been

authorized to engage in domestic security intelligence investi-

gations through a series of Presidential Directives, as reaf-

firmed, Executive Branch charters, and through the parallel

interest generated in the duty to investigate statutory violations

in the field.

Washington, H. 0. 20520

November 10, 1975

Honorable Richard S. Schweiker

United States Senate

Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Schweiker:

At the

hearing before the Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities, you asked me to comment on a

specific provision from the FBI Manual of Rules and

Regulations. As I told you at the hearing, through

some misunderstanding, I had not seen that provision

until almost immediately before the afternoon session of

the Committee began and indeed while I was at the witness

table.

I did not have an opportunity to check the specific

provision of to know about its origin. My statement that

I was sure it did not represent present policy represented

my firm belief.

I note that according to the press reports that

a Bureau spokesman later in the day informed a reporter

that the statement is still in the manual and that it does

represent Bureau policy. I am writing this letter to you,

with a copy to Senator Church, because I would not wish

to mislead the Select Committee in any way.

I do believe, however, some further explanation

is in order.

First, the Bureau informs me that the

provision has not been interpreted to mean that an investiga-

tion should not take place and that "any interpretation

that an investigation would not be instituted because

of the possibility of embarrassment to the Bureau was

never

intended and, in fact, has never been the policy of this

Bureau."

am told that "what was intended to be conveyed

was that in such eventuality FBI Headquarters desired to

be advised of the matter before investigation is instituted

so that Headquarters would be on notice and could direct

the inquiry, if necessary."

from our Manual of Rules and Regulations."

This informative memorandum, for record purposes,

reports on conference 11/10/75 between Bureau and Senate

Select Committee (SSC) personnel concerning informant matters.

Attached is a copy of an 11/7/75 letter, with

attachment, which served as a basis for the conference which

was requested by SSC Staff Member Bob Kelley.

The letter

covered three principal items: (1) a paper which the SSC

invites us to prepare concerning informant matters, (2) a

request for additional documents, and (3) a request to Share

Present at the conference on behalf of the SSC

Staff were Bob Kelley, Andy Postal, David Bushong and Jeffreý

Attendees at the conference for the Bureau were

S. I. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project, Supervisors E. P.

GrigaLus (1S-L Section) and H. A. Newman (IS-1 Section) of

INTD, and I. I. Sheer of the General Investigative Division.

The following matters were discussed at the

conference. In respect to paragraph 1, page 2, of the SSC

11/7/75 letter, Kelley acknowledged error in the letter in

that the SSC is now requesting documents relating to only

one, not two, of three former informants who are scheduled

to testify.

The former informant in question is Gary Thomas

Agents it desired to interview, principally those who had

handled the three former informants during specified

periods; and also indicated a desire to interview former

SAC Roy Moore who supervised the Special in which former

I informant Hardy was involved. By separate correspondence

we are handling the matter relating to release from confi-

dentiality agreement of the pertinent personnel.

The conference also discussed details of the

memorandum the SSC invited us to prepare, which memorandum

would enable the Bureau to present to the SSC an overall

view of our informant program.

It was agreed at the

conference that we will deal with our informant program

in the domestic field and not any aspects relating to

lassets in the counterintelligence field. Unit Chief

Grigalus was designated to coordinate and prepare the

necessary memorandum with assistance and input from Newman

and from the Criminal Informant Unit of the Special

Investigative Division, whose assistance Grigalus will

separately solicit.

Dear Mike:

As a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director

Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and

witnesses

for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's

use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like

to make the following requests.

As discussed in our mceting with Mr: Wannall, we in-

vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence

informant and source program that could be inserted in

the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at

the hearing.

This memorandum would enable the Bureau to-

present to the Select Committee a complete description

i of its program and to discuss the

issues of particular

interest to the Committee members.

These include, for

example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,

including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-

and the distinctions and relationships between the

Intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal

informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when

an informant may be used in an organization or group; and

3) the program's command and control system, including the

limits that are placed on the activities of informants

and the type of information an informant or source is per-

mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.

In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg-

islation in the informant area, such as the imposition

a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-

view.

To permit the Select Committee members to study

this

memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it

with FBI representatives during their testimony at the

by November 24.

These requests supplement our.

In addition, we wish to interview and possibly de-

The referenced request and attachment cited 14

strongly that the special briefing given to Senator Church,

Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project on

11/7/75. Shaheen indicated he did not believe any further

written information need be given to the SSC to serve as

documentation for levison's CP membership.

Phillips suggested,

and Shaheen agreed it was a good idea, to furnish the

Committee an lll along the lines ve are now taking which

will be on record with the SSC that the oral briefing was

to serve in lieu of other response.

Reference memorandum from E. W. Walsh to

Mr. Jenkins dated 11-6-75 captioned "Disciplinary Matters, Explanation

Concerning Manual Provisions."

During public testimony by Attorney General Levi before

the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities on 11-6-75,

Senator Richard Schweiker read a portion of the Rules and Regulations,

Part I, Section 9, Item C, dealing with disciplinary matters. The

Senator said the rule indicates that investigations will be halted because

they might "embarrass the Bureau." Referenced memorandum enclosed

a statement, prepared by the Administrative Division, explaining the

Bureau's policy in such matters, which was to be included in the record

of the hearings.

Mr. Hotis met with Senator Schweiker shortly after the

hearings on the afternoon of 11-6-75 and requested that the Senator insert

an explanation of our policy into the record. He told the Senator it was

incorrect to suggest that the purpose of the rule was to terminate, or

as the Senator put it "abort," an investigation that might prove to be

embarrassing to the Bureau. He said the purpose of the rule is simply

to insure that any incident or allegation that might discredit or undermine

I the public confidence in the Bureau should be brought promptly to the

attention of Bureau Headquarters to insure that the matter is handled in

an appropriate manner. Because of the controversy surrounding the

phrase "embarrass the Bureau," however, we are revising the language

of that provision so that it will more accurately convey our policy.

Senator Schweiker said he did not intend to focus attention

on the Bureau in this matter but simply was trying to underscore the need

for an Inspectors General Office in the Department of Justice. He said

he feels certain that other agencies of Government have similar policies.

awkwardly worded. Schweiker said he had not intended to be critical

of the Bureau and wanted Mr. Kelley to know that he has the utmost confi-

dence in his leadership of the Bureau and has said so on two national

'television programs. He assured Mr. Hotis that he would insert the

Bureau's explanation into the record immediately following his questioning

of the Attorney General on the subject.

Copies of the Bureau's explanation were delivered on the

morning of 11-7-75 to Duggee Hatrey, an assistant in the Senator's office.

We were later advised by Elliott Maxwell, a staff member of the committee,

that Senator Schweiker asked him to make certain that this explanation

appeared in the record of the hearings.

On morning of 9/2/75, Mr. Michael E. Shaheen, Jr.,

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Department of

Justice, was asked if the Department interposed any objection

to the Bureau referring to various surreptitious entries

which were made in connection with the four Soviet illegals.

Mr. Shaheen advised that the Department would interpose no

made in connection with our investigations of the four Soviet

illegals.

Mr. Shaheen suggested that, at the outset of the

briefing for SSC personnel, such personnel be advised that

the Department is conducting an investigation to determine

whether any criminal culpability is involved regarding

surreptitious entries conducted by the Bureau in the past.

SINATE SELECT COMMITTLE ON INTELIICENCE ACTIVITIAS (SSC)

RD: : INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC

The interview centered on FBI checks. of

IRS Tecords. Mr. Glass explained the procedure followed to

check IRS records:

He was asked if the field could check

these records directly without going through headquarters,

and he sald they could not be in security cases..

He was

asked if instructions to this effect were in the Manual

and he replied he thought they wete, but was not sure. Mr:

Glass was then provided a copy of a letter listing the

subjects who had been checked through IRS for tex returns and

asked to identify those who were KBEs and extremist subjects.

Mr, Class said that he was of the present opinion thet the

instruction in the airtel about IPS checks was latet amended

to indicate that an IRs check on each KBE be considered

rather than being mandatory. He said his recollection was

bolstered by the feet that LeRol. Jones, a KBE, according to

their list,

was checked on August 5, 1971, and not again at

a later dete.

This: would indicate that an IRS check

annually wes not mandetory:

checks made on use was by ed she Bureat ever had such as

CIA, and he replied not to his knowledge. He told them that

•IRS checks were made for lead purposes only and were done

on a very selective basis and to his recollection were not

reported when a report was submitted on a subjeet.

Mr. Glass was asked if the IRS checks were ever

used in the COINTELPRO and he replied that he would think not

because of the restriction placed on the use of this information.

He was shown a derox of a blind memorandum in the

investigation of Bobble Rush, along with a routing slip and

a letter from the Department to IRS, and

was asked if the

memorandum was the type written in cases requesting an IRS

check, and he replied that it was.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC

Mx. Glass was asked'if the KBE Program was

patterned after the Key Activist Program and he said that.

it was.

Harrigan seemed to be of the opinion that the IRS

wad part of the COINTELPRO, and he asked some questions

about the COINTELPRO which Mr. Glass declined to discuss

since he was only cleared to discuss the IRs checks.

Harrigan asked what the purpose of IRS checks

was.

Mr. Glass' responded that the IRS checks were part of

the investigation to determine the sources of finances of

extremists who traveled extensively, stockplled weapons and

seemed to have no problem financing their activities.

NOTE:

Per Supervisor P. V. Daly of the Legal Counsel

Division*,

Assistant Director Mintz orally waived the

confidentiality agreement:

This was done for expediency,

as the SSC made known its desire to interview Glass immediately

preceding the actual interview. Glass' handwritten statement

"was mailed to the Bureau and typed into the IHM.

This memorandum recommends urgently needed

consideration by Legal Counsel Division (LCD) of vital

issues in the Senate Select Committee (SSC) review of the

Martin Luther King, Jr., investigation and conference of

appropriate Bureau officials to establish Bureau's position

in respect to forthcoming SSC hearings on King matter.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams memorandum,

11/5/75, "Testimony and Furnishing of Information to

Congressional Committees" (copy attached), reports the

formation of a White House group tasked to keep the

White House advised of problems which the various Congressional

committees' requests and/or testimony before such committees

might create.

Assistant Attorney General (AG) Rex Lee,

Civil Division, is Department's representative in group.

The existence of this newly created group and the imminence

of scheduled SSC hearings on the King matter in about

10 days makes imperative Bureau considerations and setting

of policy relating to special problems discussed below.

By way of background, we have furnished the SSC

a large Volume of documentary material from our files

concerning the King and related matters. Additional infor-

mation has been given to the SSC through the medium of its

interviews of current and former FBI employees, as well as

through a special, highly classified personal briefing of

ENClOSinator Church and selected SSC Staff Members by Bureau

personnel. Two key issues should be noted: (1) In the vast

majority of instances we have excised, from material given

the SSC, vital information relating to King's subversive

connections and personal life because the ssC specifically

requested we excise information which is the product of

electronic surveillances of King and because information

might lead to identities of extremely valuable Bureau informants

(SOLO operations). (2) We have also not furnished the SSC

very enlightening Bureau documents regarding King again at

the specific request of the SSC to not furnish Bureau

monographs containing King data. For your information,

prohibition to furnishing product of electronic surveillances

on King results from certain agreements between the SSC and

the attorney for Mrs. King, apparently because, from the

best information we have, the King family desires no publicity

relating to the former investigation of King.

If the SSC goes forward with its current plans

for hearings on the King matter, public and/or executive

session, very serious problems

are anticipated. These are

primarily two in number, one relating to privacy considerations,

the other relating to the Bureau possibly being placed in the

untenable position of defending or explaining past actions

and judgements but not being able to put forth the full facts

supportive to those actions and judgements. To put it

plainly, are we going to "enter the ring with one arm tied

behind our backs?"

Also entering our study of this matter is the

necessity for securing Departmental backing for whatever

position we think is the best one to take. Again, in view

of the imminence of the hearings, alacrity in proceeding

with the action recommended is urged.

Re: Senstudy 75

ACTIONS:

1. ICD immediately give needed consideration to

the vital issues outlined above and advise:

(A) Whether privacy considerations will

inhibit Bureau testimony.

(B) Whether the Bureau should allow the

ssc to dictate the scope of the Bureau

testimony in a manner which will

prohibit full disclosure of all the facts.

2. After LCD formulates recommendations as to

(A) and (B) above, conference of appropriate Bureau officials

should be convened to resolve these important pending issues.

It is suggested, as a

minimum, conference include Messrs. J. B.

George G. Moore by SSC Staff Members

At 2:00 p.m., September 29, 1975, I appeared at the

Dirksen Senate Office Building at the request of Staff Member

James Dick to be interviewed regarding NSA monitoring activities.

(As a matter of interest, while waiting in the reception

room fox MI. Dick, I was approached by Mi. John Billfi who

introduced himself and asked if I remembered meeting him in

the office of former Assistant Director G. D. Brennan about four

years ago.

I did not remember him and so informed hin. He

stated that sometime in the next several weeks he would contact

me in order to discuss a number of things.

I told him that I

would be available in the afternoons but desired some advance

notice.)

The captioned interview commenced at about 2:05 p.m.

and lasted about one hour and 30 minutes.

It was conducted by

Mi. James Dick accompanied by Mr. Peter Fenn, both members of

the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Staft. The interview

was recorded by a

stenotypist who was described as a "court

reporter."

I was not placed under oath but was advised that I

would be asked to come back to read the typed transcript and

to swear as to its authenticity before a Senator from the

Re:

Interview of Former FBI Special Agent (SA)

Geotge C. Moore by SSG Staff Members

During the interview, I was shown a letter prepared

requesting NSA coverage.

My initials appeared as one oi those

approving the letter and I verified such and related my knowledge

of events leading up to the preparation of the letter, namely

an earlier briefing by NSA people of various representatives

of Division 5 in which we were told what NSA could produce fox

• us and

at which time we were encouraged to request such by a

letter such as the October, 1970, letter.

Other FBI documents (copies) which were exhibited to

me were two other letters prepared by members of the Extremist

Section (dates not remembered by me but letters were prepared

by Willlam H. Atkinson and Roger S. Young). I was also shown

a copy of a letter prepared by T. J. Smith to the Attorney

General fated in 1973 which discontinued our cooperation with

NSA in this matter as a result of the Keith decision.

A number of questions

were asked as to neaning of

some of the phraselogy 'in Smith's letter as well as what appeared

to be statements inconsistent with above previous-mentioned

letters.

In essence, I told them that I. J. Smith would be the

proper person to answer those questions and not me. I also told

them that I did not help prepare the letter.

They were interested in the identities of NSA people

who came over to the FBI to give the original briefing. I

could not recall any of their identities.

They seemed very interested in why the October, 1970,

letter was written, who approved it and whether Director Hoover

saw it. As to the latter question, there was no initial of

the Director but he could not tell

from the Xerox whether it

passed through his office.

Re: Interview of former FBI Special Agent (SA)

George G. Moore by SSC Staif Members

I was pressed by a series of questions as to whether

I had ever made

oral requests of NSA not confirmed by letter.

I advised that I recalled being in telephone contact on several

occasions with a "liaison contact" at NSA but believed it was

mainly as a result of his calling me and my returning his call.

I stated that although my recollection is such that I did not

recall making oral requests, I could not make a firm denial as

(I also could not recall the name of

this person at NSA who initiated the calls) Finally,

I told

Mr. Dick that if he had any information indicating I had made

such a request which would refresh my memory, such would be

helpful.

He then advised that he did have intormation such

requests were made by others in the FBI orally but not by me.

He also wanted to know my assessment as to the quantity

and quality of information fumished.

He was advised that the

quantity was extremely small and I could not judge or evaluate

quality at this date without seeing the product again.

I tried to stress throughout that actually we got very

little as a result of these requests and that we considered

such requests to be quite normal and not sinister and really

nothing to have made such an impact on ones memory as to be

remembered through the years.

Also, I furnished my opinion that

we did not consider such monitoring or requests to be "illegal"

at least prior to the Keith decision.

In addition to the above, the intervievers were

advised of a briefing given to a small group of NSA employees

re "Foreign Influence in Extremist Matters"

given by former

SA C. E. Glass and me sometime after October, 1970.

The questioning started about when I entered on duty

in the Bureau and when I was assigned to Director Hoover's

office and the positions held in that office. I was shown a

sketch which I understood had been drawn by Miss Gandy reflect

Ing the physicallayout of Director Hoover's office and using

this layout, I told them that when i was first assigned to the

Director's office, I was secretary to Mr. Holloman and pointed

out where my desk

was located and that I was not in the innediate

office with Miss Gandy until 1963.

I was asked about whether Mx. lloover may have confused

personal files and official-confidential (0C) files and I told

then I certainly felt that was not the case:

I was told that in

some of the files there would be a "buck-sllp" with "p.f."

written on

it and was asked whether the Director wrote those or

Miss Gandy, and that was why they asked it vir. Hoover might

have confused the two.

I was told that actually they could not

tell in some instances if it was iliss Gandy's writing or the

s and that there were several, particularly during yus.

I told them that I was sorr but I could not help them, that

actually I was on sick leave in Mays 1903, and again from June,

1y03, uncle danuary, 1904. I was asked who would have been on

ny desk during that

period and I told them Miss Ruth McCord.

Mr. Gitenstein indicated that it had been learned from

a previous interview that there were approximately 1l file

cabincts in the office contalning personal files and 0c files

and that an index was kept. I told them thie was my recollection

and of those, tro drawers were the oc files and these

were in

two bottom drawers of one cabinet and that actually, there was

a table in front of those drawers with reference books and

such kept on top and in order to get to those files, indicating

the 0G files were indexed on pink cards and personal files

on white.

I was asked if those files were encased in a cabinet,

and I told them they were not, that they were merely filing

cases; however, in back of Miss Gandy's desk were, I belleved

if I recalled correctly, four two-drawer filing cabinets,

stacked,

which were in

a cabinet built for them and these

contained strictly Mr. Hoover's investment and financial records.

I was asked if in the personal

files there were any files such

as on telephone bills or the like.

I told them there was not,

but that in one cabinet there were 2 or 3 drawers which

Miss Gandy maintained on such things as telephone and matters

pertaining strictly to the maintenance of Mr. Hoover's house.

In regard to the 0C files, I informed them that those

were sent to Mr. Felt during the week of Mr. Hoover's death as

well as pulling the pink index cards, which were then sent to

Mr. Felt.

I was shown a listing of files in the Oc files and

was asked if I had prepared it.

asked about the two dates, one

in October, 1971, as I recall,

which had been scratched out and the date of 4 -12 written over

seemed that Miss Gandy had indicated the Director wanted a

listing of the of tiles and the one in Uctober was prepared;

that Mr. Hoover before his death had started going through his

personal files and indicating which were to be destroyed or kept

and in those were a few which he indicated should go in the oc

Upon being questioned as to how this was physically

handled, I told then that I would pull the files, place them in

a work box and Miss Gandy would take them in to the Director and

the Director indicated to her his desires and she would so

indicate by putting a notation on the file itself.

I would then destroy the ones so indicated and would

the quantity of its I was borrowing confidential trash baskets

and then we started getting the big trash bags and that someone

From Washington Fleld would come over to get it for disposal,

They questioned about whether any of it was in boxes which were

bags and have a recollection that probably not having bags baudy,

the material was torn up and placed in boxes, as I recall, trying

to arrange the material in the box so as to make it more compact

and more roon to add nore material for destruction.

In regard to the personal files which went to

Me. Hoover's house, I was asked if I recalled how this was done,

and I told them I was sorry, but I simply could not recall. I

was also asked if there was

a time when we said it was done and

that the job had been completed.

I told them I could not

say that it actually came up, tha it was strictly a matter of

being in shock, trying to clean out after someone has passed

away, to make room for someone else to come in.

I was asked whether I had ever been out to lir. Hoover's

after his death. I told them I had not

been cort lovey shoe since his death; however, wan Miss

Gandy was on leave and i was covering her desk, each Saturday

a pouch of work was taken out to lit, lloover's home and I merely

went to the house to deliver the pouch, but did not enter.

U. S. Senate Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Interview of hrs. Irma D. Meccall,

Administrative Assistant to the Director

of the FBI, by SSG Start Members

I was asked if I recalled any personal file cabinets

being moved to Mr. Hoover's home and I told them I did not;

that some of the empty ones were removed as it was not felt

he would need that many,

I was asked if I stayed on in Mr. Gray's

office.

I told them I did.

NOTE:

The 9/2/75 contact with the Legal Counsel Division

by Gitenstein was with Supervisor P. V. Daly.
