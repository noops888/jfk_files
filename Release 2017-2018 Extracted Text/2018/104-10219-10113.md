‘the Caradian Press Correspondent in ‘toscow, *
Buckley, approacted our Sbassy inforsally in the ats
Necexber on behalf of illias #artin, the ex-employee of NSA
who defected to the Soviet Unicn in 150.

\ecording to Ruckley, vartin wishes to see ais parents
for compassionate reasons ard wants to xuow if he weuld ve
adaitted to Canada without fear of extradition to the United
States {f he were to arrange a rencez-vo.s vith !is parents in
Yancourer. ¢o not know whether Nartin st/12 nas a United
States passport or whether he has becoxe a Soviet citizen. In
any ovent Martin consisers riaself inadzissible to tha United
States.

cuckley met Nartin at the apartcent of Howard kausch,
the Moscow correspondent fer NeGraw-fFill Puclications. In
addition Martin later telephcsed luckley to indie.te nis interest
in finding cvt wether or mot he could cone to Canada, cuckley
assunez, quite rizhtly I would think, that the sanrer in which
yartin has nade his request indiestes that his Sussian hosts are
awaro of his interest in yetting out of the Sovi:t Union to see
his parentse

‘ae have infercod our Zabassy that it sheule take no
action to enceuraze Puckley or Martin to vclieve that a visa
would ve granted if
Since, however, ‘artin's interest in coxing to Canaca ds already
in a nevspapersan's hands, ve cannot rule cut the jossioility
that Mokley wicht write abeut iartints interest. Suen a story
would prebaply lead te the need for an expression cf the Canadian
Soverreest's attitude, In xaking recosvencitions on the king ef
response that aight J: made in the evert that a questien is put
to my Minister, it wuld te sost useful to know what sartin's
status in law is so far as tne Lnited states is concerned. If,
for exatple, your Yovernrent could not taxe legal action, the
Canacian authorities would ce i: a position is this aatter caw
to publie a! they were not aware of any barrier
preventing > his parents in the United tes.

I should oe zost crateful if trrough your channels ve could de
provided infcrvally with an irdication of dartin's status in law
in the United

Buckley's only other coment on tartin was that he Giantt
really mov wat to aake of Martin. Martin seexed outspoken in
dealing with the shorteowings of life in the Soviet Cnion. On the
other hand he spoke with a slight stamzer ard see..s nervous.
Buckley's view for what it is vorth is that Martin is not interested
in getting into trouble with the xussians cr caing anything vhich
they sight consicer underhanted. I should emphasize that no sexter
of the Canadian Eabassy bas bad any direct contact with Martin,
