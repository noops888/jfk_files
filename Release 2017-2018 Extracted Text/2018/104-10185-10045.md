iter for thé KUTUBE/D purpose explained to Desmond:and !

a inig-on CORBISIERO in all possible KUBARK’ e8,
te ODENVE and ODUKGE files; results were negative.

2. we ‘ghould @ppreciate your making Clarkson available to brief
ORBISIERG and send bidi-omhis search mission. Tse criteria sheet left with
. Sheridan’ ‘by Rabiey is the basic refereace document for Clarkson, but we should -

like to add. two items: (a) On the basis of our recent experiences, it may well

turn out to be the case that candidates contacted by Corbisiero through his friends

fn the underworld will be unwilling during the first contact to give their true names
and other data. In fact, this would be normal, and we anticipate the necessity of
Corbisiero’s revisiting pronifsing candidates to obtain data for tracing purposes
and to make accurate assesaments. {b) We stress quality; if Corbislero returns
frou, bis first search mission.with only 4 couple of candidates, we shall not be
dipappointed. .Plenty of patience and a high degree of selectivity will net us more
in the long run than aiming at quick accomplishments.

Tay 3. As we understood it from Clarkson, Corbisiero will start his search in
Aatwerp. Please insure that he does agi search in Frauce since we have activities
underway there with which he may unwittingly crose wires. We also consider It

inadvisable that he search in Italy.

4 We have obligated $1600 for Corbisiero's mission, to include travel
and ops expenses and pay for hie time. More is available if needed. Regarding
the amount of pay, we leave this up to you and Clarkson on the basis of the time

- spent on the mission and the extent to which you are satisfied that he made a
conscientious and secure effort. Costs should be charged to KUTUBE/ 9, citing

Cost Center 1123-1030-1009. “
