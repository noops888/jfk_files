REQUIRED REFÈRENCES

During Rabney's TDY la Rome la April 1961, Clarkson gave him the

name of Tommaso CORDISIERO, owner of the Ear Marisa in Florence, so a

potential spoitor for the KUTUBE/D purpose explained to Desmond and Sherican.

We have now comploted the tracing on CORSISIERO in all possible KUBARK tiles.

Greenlist. ODENVY and ODURGE iles; results were negative.

Hi: nihould appreciate your making Clafkson avnilable to brief.

CORBISIERO and send him on his search mission. The criteria sheet left wich

Sheridat by Rabney in the basic refereace document for Clarkson," but we should

Like to add two items: (a) Da lhe basis of our recent experiences, it may well

tarn out to be the case that candicates contacted by Corbisiero through his friende

in the underworld will be unwilling during the firet contact to give their true names

and other data. In fact, thia would be normal, and we anticipate the necosmity of

Corbisiero's revisiting promining candidates to obtain data for tracing parposes

and to make accurate assesments. fo) We streas quality; il Corbintero returns

from Ali firsl search mission with only a couple of candidates, we shall sot be

disappointed. Plenty of patience and a high degree of selectivity will act ua more

in the long run than aiming at quick accomplishments.

3.

As we understood it from Clarkson, Corbisiero will start his search in

Antwerp.

Please innure that he does api search in Frauce since we have activities

anderway there with which he may unwittingly cross wirea. We also consider it

inadvisable that he search in Italy.

We have obligated $1000 for Corbisiero'a missioa, to include travel

and ops expenses and pay for hio time. More in available if needed. Regarding

the amount of pay, we leave this up to you and Clarkson on the basis of the time

• spent on the mission and the extent to which you are satisfied that he made a

conscientions and secure effort. Costs should be charged to KUTUBI! D, citing
