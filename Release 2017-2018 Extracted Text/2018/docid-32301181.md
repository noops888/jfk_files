PG 92-236

New Kensington, Pa., Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and the
majority of his City Councilmen have been "owned" by

the MANNARINOs since their election approximately eight
years ago. At one time, JOE MEROLA, at the instructions
of KELLY MANNARINO, "wired" the New Kensington City

Council chambers so that tape recordings of the proceedings
could be made.

Chief JOHN BORDONAROS; New Kensington, Pa., Police Depart-
ment, is, the personal selection for the job of KELLY .
MANNARINO,

It is noted that Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK of New Kensington
was defeated in the primary elections of May, 1961, and
will not be a candidate for re-election in the general
elections of November, 1961.

The August 29, 1961, edition of the "Daily Dispatch,"
daily newspaper published in New Kensington, Pa., carried
an editorial entitled "The MANNARINOs Rule." This
editorial is as follows:

"That the Mannarino mob owns the administration
of Mayor Raymond E. Gardlock lock, stock and
barrel and has absolute control of Chief John
Bordonaro's police department was conclusively
demonstrated to the satisfaction of even the most
skeptical last Thursday during the raid on the
notorious gambling casino.

"For three hours not a policeman showed up to
regulate traffic in the vicinity or to control a
crowd upwards of 500 which formed while the
federal agents were at work,

"To offer the excuse, as city hall has done,

that the police department did not know what

was happening is ridiculous and no one in his
right mind will believe it. You can be sure that
police officials knew all along exactly what was
happening and that the failure to send officers

to the scene was deliberate. And they also knew
right along of the existence of the casino and yet
never raised a finger against it. To ask why
they failed to act is needless - everyone knows.
