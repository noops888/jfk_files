NE IGT: Censidltant for Cuba - Edward G. Tichborn ee:

Lh Feliowing the recoipt of an affirnatiy, he
Tichborn, I talked on 16 hovonber with Hessrs:
Landreth cf xH Division and we decided that I
Ticktorn and try to arrange for hin to go to Cuba ea eocn ac poseible,
Tha sana’ day I contacted Tichborn by phone and arranged for a Beoting ‘in
Los engoles on 13 liovexber.

in Los angeles on 18 Kovenber, We reviewed the situation i

detail and Ivasked him if he would be svailoble to make’a TDY trip to Cuba

to investigate possitilities of our coalescence of tho.fof-Coxmnuni é

to Fidel Captro into a polities] organization.
t destrous’ of going, hovever, he said that the questiai

partloularly unfortunste. time a6 ho hod just boon’ retained by

cuoontrect tilgretory Yaxican workers. Tt would appear that according to aq
the agreenetits reached between the contractors and tae labor forces, the

contractoFs are alloired to deduct the cost of subsistance-on a:maxinimn-of :
31.75 por day} from the wages paid the leborers.’. although in ‘most. 28
subsistence costs considerably less than $1.75 a dey; contractor: -
witzholding the raxisun ancunt. The Hexican Governnent. on. behalf of

detween actual subsistance costs end the ancunt withheld.

about vhat he would haveto charge for his’ services,”
pointed out-our say scald
sonething “in-te nelghberliood ‘of .1500 for a month's work, din
“that this suz.represented $13,0U0 per year. which was. the top’ salary’ fo:
government official.’ Tichborn said that he appreciated the difficulties:
dnberent in this type of thing and that he vould need sometime to think over
what he would hsve to charge brleebei subjecting binself to'an undue’ financial

hardship...
3. Iwas much inprossed with Tichborn's inrodiate grasp of the

difficulties involved end the typo of operation I proposed for hin to :

good. He painted out that one of the first revolutions to take place in

Eodern times was tha Mexican revolution ef Pancho Villa.” “Re sta that hie

fenily had been intinately connected wth this revolution and that he found

nany points of sluilarity between the aftermath’ of tho Mexicsn Revolution —
nationalication, agrdten“forn -- and Castro's prosont movercats. He pointed

out that this was not'a surprising situation as Castro hinself spent a 7

-Considurable ancunt of time in,Cubs and it would bo neural thst some

of his actions should follow this pattern, In addition tothe above, Tichborn i
came up wth a number of sugsostions which I believe can besé be gone into :

at any briefing sossicns: held between wii and Tichborn, One poiat which = :
particularly inprossed me was Tichborn's appreciation of the situation, also :

his early recognition of the fact that one of our prime targets should be

members of the 26 July Kovenent who Lave bscome disenchanted as a result of

Cactrots denagogie actions,

4. In onler to save time and to allow Tichborn to give the matter
onough, thought, I intend to propose to wH Division thet Tichbarn came east
next week fer two or three days, to discuss the Cuban situation with 7
representatives of WH, At the end of this, he will return to Los Angelos,
get the case underway and hopefully will be availeble to go to Cuba -right-
after the first of January, ds soon as I have cleared this with. WH; I,
shall have. the travel orders written and ack Tichborn to cone east,
