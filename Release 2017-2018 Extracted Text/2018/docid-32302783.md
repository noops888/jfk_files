The following activity of the subject not previously reported con-

cerns her functioning in Communist Party circles during the years 1944 and

1945.

On May 25, 1944 Confidential Informant I-l advised that he atten-

ded a conference between the subject SuE WARREN and DAVID GOLDWAY, Educational

Director for the New York State Communist Political Association at which time

the subject expressed her deep regret that no resolution was passed at the

CPA National Convention of 1944 concerning the release of MORRIS SCHAPPES

from prison. GOLDWAY at this conference according to the informant, promised

to contact high functionaries in the Communist Party and the subject agreed

to do likewise to the end that concerted action might be taken by the various

Communist Political Associations throughout the United States to obtain the

release of SCHAPPES. As was pointed out in previous reports, SCHAPPES was

eventually paroled from prison shortly prior to October 24, 1944•

Association and that these

students were considered by the leaders of the

Communist Political Association to be potential leaders of the Party. The

informant advised that the subject stressed the importance of regular

attendance and thorough attention to the course. The same informant pro-

vided information concerning the outline of the course to be presented at

this class and indicated that it would concern itself generally with the

Marxist definition of war, the classification of previous wars as "just".

and 'unjust" and as "progressive" and "reactionary". The study outline of the

course as described by the informant termed the Revolutionary and the Civil

wars of the United States as "just' wars while World War I of 1914-18 was

termed an "imperialistic". war.

The required reading of the course consisted of the 19th Volume

Of LENIN's "Collective Works", BROWDER's pamphlet "Teheran" and a pamphlet

entitled

"Victory and After"' by PAIME

DUTTE.

Confidential National Defense Informant ND-283, whose identity is

the Bureau, advised that he was present at a meeting of the

STUYVESANT VICTORY CLUB, I2th Assembly District, 160 Third Avenue, New York

City, on January 9, 1945 at which nominations were made for executive

positions in the club. On this occasion the subject generally known as

SUE WARREN, was nominated for the Executive Committee. It was the informant's

impression

that the subject had not heretofore been a member of the STUYVESANT

CLUB and that she had apparently been transferred to STUYVESANT CLUB or

"else manouvered in for the purpose:of becoming a club officer".

Confidential Informant T-5 advised that on January Il, 1945 she

conferred with the subject in personal interview at the County Headquarters on Fourth

Avenue.. On this occasion the subject questioned the informant at some length

concerning the Training School and asked the informant's opinion concerning

classmates, instructors, lectures and the course in general. The subject

assigned to the informant the duty of reading supplementary material and of

reporting in a detailed way the material which had been covered during the

course.

Subject on this occasion indicated that the County was attempting to

inaugurate new systems of teaching and that any constructive criticisms and

reactions would be welcomed. The subject explained, according to the

informant, that the County had great hopes for the students of the course and

that their progress would be closely watched during their future activities.

Confidential Informant T-2 advised that at a meeting of the

County Executive Comnittee on January 12, 1945 the subject announced the

reprint of a "Daily Worker" article entitled "Liberals and Foreign Policy"

for general distribution in the County area.

The same informant made available a memorandum of the County

officials which set forth 1945 objectives and listed the subject as available

for help as "County Secretary for Press and Education".

Confidential Informant ND-283, whose identity is known to the

Bureau, advised that he attended the annual election of the STUYVESANT VICT ORI

CLUB on January 23, 1945, at which time the subject was elected as "Member

at Large, Executive Conmittee". The informant described the subject's complete

title as

"Educational Director, New York County Communist Political Association,

and former Section Organizer".

/Confidential Informant ND-107, whose identity is known to the

Bureau,

stated that on or about January 24, 1945 the subject was actively

functioning as County Educational Director by personally sending out

literature to the various CPA clubs; this literature included the following

pamphlets:

"Outline for Leadership Training Class", "Role and Function of

the CPA" and "That This National Shall Have a New Birth of Freedom". It is

to be noted that copies of these pamphlets have previously been furnished to

the Bureau.

on January 31, 1945 Confidential Informant ND-225, whose identity

is known to the Bureau,

attended a CPA Press Meeting at 8:30 p.m., 13 Astor

Place, Room 505.

The informant reported that there were approximately sixty

people present representing the various press committees of the CPA clubs.

The informant recalled that the subject SUE WARREN as County Secretary of

Press and Education was in charge of the meeting. The subject on this

occasion summarized the accomplishments of the CPA during 1944 and set forth

plans for the year 1945 contidential Intormant No-JU, whose identity Ii

nown to the Bureau advised that he attended the same meeting and he recallec

that the subject opened the meeting by saying that Uncle Joe's boys would

soon be in Berlin and punish the Nazis and that the people here at home must

see that our boys are not fighting in vain to stamp out Fascism and then

return to find it so prominent in their own country. The informant stated

that the subject spoke of "reactionary forces" opposing President Roosevelt

in his appointment of WALIACE as Secretary of Commerce and she then outlined

Confidential Informant ND-107, whose identity is known to the

Bureau, advised that on February 26, 1945 he attended a County Council neeting

of the Conmunist Political Association at the Irving Plaza Hotel, 15 Irving

Place, New York City. He stated that two hundred people were present,

including the subject SUE WARREN whom the informant on this occasion described

-4-

as "formerly County Educational Director". It is to be noted that no other

information received from other sources has indicated that the subject has

ceased to function as County Educational Director, and it is believed that

this informant may therefore be in error in his description.

The same informant on April 2, 1945 attended a meeting of the

HENRY FORBES COMMUNITY CLUB at 50 East 13th Street, New York City, at which

time he recognized the subject as one of those present.

were present. The informant described the subject as Educational Director

for New York County and said that she castigated both DUBINSKY and JOHN I

XLENIS for infiltrating CIO unions and for forming a campaign to oppose the

reelection of President Roosevelt. The subject appealed for unity behind

the Teheran and Crimean decisions and pointed out that "The, CPA owes its

success to its adherence to Marxism, the science of history which enables

members not only to understand events but to help shape them.

We have much

to do and far to go; we are creating and bringing forward a higher type of

individual, deeper and more creative thought, bolder and more consistent

action.

We are linking ourselves, indissolubly with constantly growing masses

of people, and it is up to us to continue

to do so".

The same informant described the subject as a member of UNITY

CENTER CLUB, 2744 Broadway, and stated that she was identical with TILLIE

GOLDWAY.

It is to be noted that the same confusion concerning the identity

of the subject and of TILLIE GOLDWAY was reported by Confidential Informant

TOM WARD, whose identity is known to the Bureau, who also for a time labored

under the illusion that the subject and COLDWAY are identical. To clarify

the situation Confidential Informant TOM WARD was asked to determine the

cause of the confusion. He later advised-that TILLIE GOLDWAY Who was the

wife of DAVID GOLDVAY, former Educational Director for the New York State,

Communist Political Association, was generally known throughout the CPA

clubs as SUE WARREN. From subsequent contact with both individuals, Confi-

dential Informant TOM WARD determined that they were not in fact the same

but he could give no reason for the belief held by many people that they

were.. It should be stated that the subject in her capacity as County Edu-

cational Director had frequent occasion to contact DAVID GOLDWAY while he

held the office of State Educational Director. The frequency of this

contact was stressed by Confidential Informant T-l who advised particularly

that during the campaign for the release of MORRIS SCHAPPES, GOLDWAY and the

subject were in frequent conversation. It is believed that

this may account

- 5-

NY 100-42479

in a large measure for the confusion in the minds of CPA members and the

possible belief that SUE WARREN iS DAVID GOLDAY's wife.

Confidential Informant ND-107, whose identity is known to the

Bureau, advised that on May 29, 1945 he

attended a meeting of the WEST MIDTOWN

CLUB at #5 Columbus Circle. He stated

that there were about sixty people

present which was practically twice the usual attendance.

Prior to this

occasion the subject was advertised as the principal speaker who would

discuss the topic "The CPA Political Scene". In the publicity prior to the

meeting the subject was described as Educational Director for New York County.

It was informant's belief that the large attendance was due to the fact that

the membership was seeking a clarification of the criticism of FARI

BROWDER'S

policy by the French Communist DUCLOS.

The subject in opening her talk stated that the discussion would

be in the spirit of learning rather than in the spirit of one who had

knowledge to impart.

She urged that the membership read the DUCLOS article

which was reprinted in the "Sunday Worker" for May 27 and that it be read

and reread several times before forming a conclusion or an opinion.

According to the informant the subject sid that the CPA intended that the

accusations be discussed and criticized fully in the clubs and that she

felt that the Communists of America believed that with the cessation of

hostilities in Europe the time had come to re-examine the program and the

accomplishments under. "the new line". The subject honestly felt, she stated;

that there had been no error in following the line since Teheran and that

she was willing to answer any questions to the best of her ability on the

reactions to the DUCLOS article and to the present Party Line. She pointed

out, however, that her answers would be her private and personal opinions and

should not be taken to represent the opinions or policy of the CA or of

the National Committee.

Following these opening remarks by the subject, according to the

informant, there was general discussion of the situation by various members

present.

The question was raised as to the propriety of EARL BROWDER's

statement that Communists should be prepared to give up. the idea of

Socialism for the present and form a coalition with capitalism. In answer

to this question the subject stated that it is wrong to infer or to interpret

BRODER's meaning in this statement that this was for an indefinite period

of time.

She pointed out that Marxism is a changing science and that under

the conditions at the time BROWDER's statement was issued this was the

correct policy to follow. She pointed out that BROWDER had not promised that

the policy would be adhered to indefinitely. The informant recalled that

one of the audience asked why the rank and file members of the organization

had not been informed of FOSTER's disagreement with the policy of the

National Committee. The informant stated that the subject replied that as

-6-

## Page 7

NY 100-42479

far as she was concerned she thought that that was a wrong policy and that

she personally would have liked to have seen the matter taken to the rank

and file members.

She pointed out, however,

that the plans for the

dissolution of the Party had come at a time when it was necessary. for all

Communist forces to be united and that the leadership apparently felt that

It was not wise to permit WILLIAV

FOSTER'S letter to become public to

create factionalism and disunity.

The informant recalled further that the subject stated that the

members of the Communist Political Association had underestimated monopolistic

capitalism in the United States and had been inclined to paint a rosy picture

of the future. She stated that this was a wrong interpretation and that the

members now know that capitalism had been strengthened more than ever due

to war and had "changed its coat". She said that criticism of BROWDER'S

statement that we would have a "class peace that would extend to the post

war period" was unwarranted and that he meant only that we would have a

class peace as long as the situation and political scene remained the same.

The subject insisted that there was no revision of Marism in the present

policy of the CPA but she admitted that a basic Marxist mistake was made

in the relaxation of the struggle against the capitalistic system and in

believing that a coalition for a long term was possible.

According to the informant the subject concluded by urging the

members not to be disturbed because of this mistake and to "rise out of it

and build a stronger Communist movement than ever'.

Confidential Informant I-4 advised on June 4, 1945 the subject was

one of a number of CPA functionaries who were seated on the stage of Man-

hattan Center on the occasion of a Communist Political Association mass

meeting held at that place for a discussion of the United Nations Conference.

Forty-five hundred people or thereabouts were reported to be in attendance

and the discussion extended to the effect on Communist Political Association

policy of the DUCIOS article.

Confidential Informant ND-107, whose identity is known to the

Bureau, advised that he attended a class on June 6, 1945 at the WEST MIDTOWN

CLUB, #5 Columbus Circle, for instruction in "Marxist in Current Problems".

The informant advised that the instructor was ESTHER CARROLL who announced

that the class directors should during the vacation period consult SUE. WARREN

for help in any problems arising in the conduct of the class. ESTHER CARROLI

on this occasion, according to the informant, described SUE WARREN as the

County Educational Director.
