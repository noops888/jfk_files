SUGAR MILL AND DROPPED FOUR 100 POUND NAPALM BOMBS, ONE 150

POUND DYNAMITE BOMB, AND OTHER INCENDIARY MATERIAL ON SUGAR

FIELDS.

ON JANUARY 20, MM-639-S REPORTED THAT BOSCH FURNISHED HIM

TODAY WITH FOLLOWING STORY. ON JANUARY 16 AN AMERICAN FRIEND,

UNIDENTIFIED TO INFORMANT, FROM SOUTH CAROLINA ARRIVED IN

MIAMI FLYING AN AERO COMMANDER. THIS PLANE BELONGS TO HIS COM-

PANY, UNIDENTIFIED TO INFORMANT, FOR WHICH THIS AMERICAN WORKS.

BOSCH ASKED THIS AMERICAN IF HE WOULD FLY A MISSION. THE AMERICAN

AGREED AND LEFT THE NEXT DAY, JANUARY 17. THE AMERICAN WAS

ACCOMPANIED ON THIS MISSION BY ONE CUBAN, UNIDENTIFIED BY

BOSCH, CARRYING TWO NAPALM BOMB AND TWO EXPLOSIVE BOMBS. THEY

FLEW OVER PINAR DEL RIOPROVINCE FOR 25 MINUTES UNTIL THEY FOUND

THE TARGET. THE BOMBS

WERE THEN THROWN OUT THE WINDOW AND THE

PLANE RETURNED TO THE U.S. THEY DID NOT SEE ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT

OR BOATS. (

BOSCH COMMENTED THAT U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT DENIED THE

RAID TOOK PLACE, BUT THEN THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED IT

AND NOW THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS HIM UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE

BOSCH DISCLOSED HE WILL LEAVE MIAMI ON JANUARY 21 FOR

NEW YORK CITY FOR TWO DAYS AND WILL THEN TRAVEL TO SAN JUAN,

PUERTO RICO. THE PURPOSE OF THIS TRIP IS TO RAISE MONEY BASED

ON THE PRESS PUBLICITY CONCERNING THE ALLEGED RAID. (K)(U

MM-639-S SAID IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT ANY SUCH RAID

TOOK PLACE, OR THAT BOSCH COULD OBTAIN THE SERVICES OF A PILOT

AND PLANE ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. INFORMANT ALSO POINTED OUTAL

CONFIENTIAL

If the intelligence contained in the above message is to be disseminated outside the Bureau, it is suggested that it be suitabl

paraphrased in order to protect the Bureau's cryptographic systeme.
