Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in
order to cover three Yugoslav lines. Two of the lines which were disconnected
were Cuban Embassy lines, both were not in use by the Cubans. One was in
the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by
other Cubans. The other was a telephone in the Cuban Embassy which was
never answered, The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas* line moved to the
Embassy. They have also asked for the telephone company to repair 14-92-14,
As soon as these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav
Embassy lines will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish on the
Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and as of 18 and 23
September the Yugoslav lines (three). These transcripts are received each
morning for the day before. During September, the LIENVOY monitors
transcribed 1396 pages in addition to the daily resumen.

The outside translators now working on LIENVOY transcripts are
Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, who is used for almost any backlog which
begins to occur.

David B, SCHLAGETER, field contract agent, who transcribes the
Czech take.

Victor W, OBOLD, career agent, who transcribes the Yugoslav portion
of the Yugoslav take.

Douglas J, FEINGLASS, staff agent, who continues to transcribe the
Russian language portion of the Soviet take.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Information

promptly followed up by station investigative assets who identified the woman
and learned that she was attending a philosophers' conference at the University

PERSONALITY BRIEF

1. General Lazaro CARDENAS del Rio

As a pro-Communist, anti-United States former (1934-1940)
President of Mexico, CARDENAS plays an important role in the
political activities of Mexico by virtue of his being the
spirtual leader of a great part of the Mexican left. His
leftist sympathies appear to fall primarily with the current
regime in Cuba (He alledgedly is a close personal friend of
Fidel CASTRO), secondarily with Communist China, and

lastly with the USSR.

2. Braulio MALDONADO Sandez

MALDONADO is a politically unscrupulous pro-Communist
former Governor of Baja California. He is a national leader

. of at least three Mexican leftist organizations: (1) FEP
(People's Electoral Front), united single front of Mexican
Communists and Leftists; (2) MLN (Nationa] Liberation
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Cuba Communist Front; :and
(3) CCI (Independent Peasants' Center), radical, anti-Mexican
Government organization. Having been banished from Mexico
until after the 1964 elections for anti-government activities,
MALDONADO is currently in Europe and seeking admittance to
the USSR, obstensibly to visit his daughter who is a student
at the Friendship University in Moscow.

3. Alonso AGUILAR Monteverde

AGUILAR is a prominent pro-Communist Mexican intellectual
who is the titular head of the MLN (National Liberation
Movement), rabidly anti-U.S., pro-Communist front. He is a
full-time professor at the National Autonomous University of
Mexico and maintains active contact with several international
leftist and Communist figures. He has recently travelled to
Cuba and Warsaw.

4. Jorge Leonidas TAMAYO Castillejos

TAMAYO is a Communist professor at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico. Heis a leading member of many Communist
front. activities in Mexico including the CMP (Mexican Peace

50-6 - 79/3



Committee), the MLN (National Liberation Movement), and the
CEM (Circle of Mexican Studies). He has been in contact with
several leftist figures of various echelon, including Gen.
Lazaro CARDENAS, the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, and Polish,
Soviet, and Chinese Communist officials. TAMAYO's son has
studied in Warsaw and travelled to the USSR and Communist
China.

5. Jose David ALFARO Siqueiros

ALFARO, one of Mexico's most prominent artists, has been
imprisoned for eight (8) years as a consequence of the role

he played in the Communist-inspired railroad stike of 1959.

He is a leader of the PCM (Mexican Communist Party) and has
visited the Soviet Union, He fought for the Loyalist Army

in the Spanish Civil War and was later arrested in Mexico

for complicity in the murder of Leon TROTSKY's secretary.
ALFARO has a long history of pro-Communist, anti-U.S. leanings.

6. Roberto ROMERO Adams

ROMERO is an informant for the Cuban Intelligence Service
in Mexico.

7. Enrique GONZALEZ Pedrero

Pro-Communist professor at the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, GONZALEZ Pedrero has contributed to the
writing or editing of at least five (5) leftist publications
in Mexico. He is a member of the National Committee of the
MLN, has alledgedly received training in the Soviet Union,
and has travelled to Cuba twice in recent times.

8. Ignacio ACOSTA Lagunes

Pro-Communist ACOSTA, a lawyer, is an aide of General
CARDENAS and a leading member of the MLN, He frequently has
contact with high-level personnel of both the Cuban and
Soviet Embassies in Mexico City. His political activities
include travel to Cuba and the Soviet Union, aid in the
management of the Communist Trade Fair in Mexico, and a great
deal of participation in promoting sympathy for the Cuban
Revolution in Mexico.

9. Direccion Federal de Seguridad - Federal Security Police

The principal functions of this security unit are to:

(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,
(2) maintain an extensive telephone tap activity on both

the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and

(3) perform investigations and arrests of primarily political
offenses. The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,
insecure, and unreliable. Their professional characteristics
are best described as being dishonest, cruel, and abusive.
The position, at this moment, of Manuel RANGEL Escamilla as
Director General of DFS is precarious,

10. Politica

A Marxist anti-U.S. semi-monthly magazine published in
Mexico, Politica is printed by Talleres Graficos de Mexico,
the same Shop which prints La Voz de Mexico. In addition to
the modest revenues derived from a circulation of 15,000

to 25,000, Politica is financed by the Soviet Embassy, the
MLN, the PPS, and possibly, the Cuban Embassy. AS an
indication of the Mexican government's assessment of the
capability of this magazine to influence public opinion, it
is worthwhile noting that Politica frequently experiences a
great degree of difficulty in printing and circulating itself
due to the government's repressive efforts.

11. Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN)

Organized under the influence of the PCM in August 1961,
the MLN today is dedicated to the furtherance of the mutual
interests of its adherents who are found primarily in the
ranks of the PRI, the PPS, the PCM, the CNC and the UGOCM.

The MLN's objective is to gain leftist political represen-
tation in the government by inciting PRI to accept leftists
into its camp. As a consequence of this objective, the mission
of MLN is to generate evidence of popular leftist sympathy

by means of fomenting agitation among the popular, labor, and
peasant masses.

12, Confederacion de Trabajadores de la America Latina (CTAR)""~

The CTAL has recently been replaced by the CUTAL (Single
Confederation of Latin American Workers). Until recently, the



pro-Communist, CTAL, which is described as being the liaison
bureau of the WFTU (World Federation of Trade Unions) whose
headquarters are in Prague, was headed by Vicente LOMBARDO
Toledano,

13. Prensa Latina

Operatiéng directly under the Cuban Communist regime,
Prensa Latina is obstensibly a press service. In reality,
however, it is the official propaganda organ of the Cuban
Government. Prensa Latina works closely with Tass, the
Soviet Agency; with Hsinhua, the Chinese Agency;and with
Cetepka, the Czechoslovakian Agency.
