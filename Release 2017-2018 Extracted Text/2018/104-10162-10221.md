MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Telephone Conversation with AMEMBER-1] about his
meeting witn Lois SOMSA

DATE 1 210 dply 1963, 1800 hours

1. AMENBER-1 called me to tell m that lie had had lunch
with Luis SOMOSA. He said Somosa's aoparent purpose in arranging
the luncheon, for it had been-upor Somosa's initiative that they
had gotten together, was to discuss certain Cuban refugees who
seem to be gearing up for action in regard to the question of
Cuban liberation. I asked after nanes and Sudtect cited Veciana,
Batista Falla, and AMSIDDY-1, stating that these were the names
Somosa had thrown out during discussion, I asked Sudject.to. tell
me what he had said in regard to eacn amd attested to elicit
Brine own: views on each of these personalities, Pertinent for
record 1s the fact tnat Subject declared to Sonosa tnat

pirat was, in his ow view, a very questionable fellow for

two reasons: the first, he wes overly. cncky and inordinately
ambitious and, secondly, he comes fron a pro-coormnist farily.

In an attempt to deterzine Somsa's views on AMIDDY-1, I requested
that Subject define more precisely what he meant by commnist family,
but wes unable to obtain a meaning‘ul response. I asked Subject if
dn the lest instance it sizply didn't boil down to the fact that he
gust didn't like MMBIDDY and he agreed that tois right well be the
ease, Along the line Subject stated that Sousa had sirply been

' thinking of taking up some sort of contact with AMSIDDi-l. I did
not press for further details in view of my presumption that there
was probably eome special sort of relationship between Somosa and
AMBIDDY-1, the nature of which it wo char unbealthy for Subject ta

ie Those portions of the phone chll. devoted to AMBIDDY-1
“d4@ mot tie the sane proportions to the. whole as. the discussion
of AMBIDDY-1 does to this report. The bulk of the conversation
eencornsd inquiries on my part inte the depth and nature of Subject's
relationship with Somosa, Subject oad know Somosa for decades and
is a very close friend of the entire family, owns large’ tracts of
property in Nicaragua and is oresently. considering. entering vapon:
