SUMMARY: THIS CABLE CONTAINS ASSESSMENT DATA FROM

FGFORK/86 (F/86) ON SLLARCENX/1 (L/1), BASED ON F/86'S

OBSERVATIONS OF, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH,

THEIR REF OUTING TO

ISCUSS TORE JAN EL AND FAMILY DURING

3. L/1 DID THE DRIVING FROM

HE DOES

NOT LIKE DRIVING AT NIGHT OR IN THE RAIN. IN CONTRAST WITH HIS

NORMALLY PLEASANT PERSONALITY, L/1 BECOMES AGGRESSIVE AND

NERVOUS BEHIND THE WHEEL.

WHILE FAMILIES WERE STAYING TOGETHER IN RATHER SMALL

BEACH HOUSE, L/1 AND HIS WIFE GOT INTO A FIGHT.

SHE APPEARED

TO BE THE INSTIGATOR.

F/86'S WIFE LATER TALKED TO L/I'S WIFE

IN PRIVATE.

L/1'S WIFE SAID SHE BLAMES L/1 BECAUSE WHEN L/ 1

DIVORCED HIS PREVIOUS WIFE, HE GAVE HER HIS APARTMENT.

L/1 AND HIS CURRENT WIFE WILL NOT HAVE THEIR OWN PLACE TO LIVE

WHEN THEY EVENTUALLY RETURN TO CUBA.

THAT IS WHY,

PREVIOUS TRIP TO CUBA FROME

DURING THEIR

ROOM ONTO HOUSE OF MRS. L/1'S PARENTS IN

RENTS 1 AND WIFE BUILT AN EXTRA

5. MRS. L/1 ALSO SAID THAT I/1 IS "MUY CONSUMISTA" (I.E.,

A COMPULSIVE SHOPPER), AND THAT SHE HAS TO CONTROL HIM WHEN

THEY GO TO THE SUPERMARKET BECAUSE L/1 ALWAYS BUYS TOO MUCH.

MRS. L/1 EXPLAINED THAI L/I GREW UP IN A VERY POOR FAMILY.

THAT IS WHY HE NOW BUYS TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING. SHE ALSO

SENSIND: PL

CRITICIZED L/1 FOR SPOILING THEIR CHILDREN (HIS OLDER DAUGHTER

BY PREVIOUS MARRIAGE AND THEIR YOUNGER DAUGHTER), BY GIVING

THEM WHATEVER THEY ASK FOR.

MRS. L/1 HAS A POOR RELATIONSHIP

WITH THE OLDER DAUGHTER.

SHE ADDED THAT L/1'S RELATIONSHIP

WITH HIS TWO GROWN SONS IS GOOD BUT SOMEWHAT DISTANT.

/86 PERSONALLY OBSERVED L/1'S COMPULSIVE SHOPPING WHE

HEY ALL WENT TO JON 8 JAN. BOTH L/1 AND HIS WIFE BOUGH

LARGE NUMBER OF ITEMS TO SEND TO THEIR FAMILY IN CUBA. AT ONE

POINT, L/1 TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD DO THE BUYING AND SHE

SHOULD BE THE HOUSEWIFE.

MRS. L/1 CALLED HIM A "DUMB SPANIARD"

("GALLEGO BRUTO"). F/86 SUSPECTS THAT L/1 AND WIFE HAVE OTHER

PROBLEMS, POSSIBLY DUE TO L/I'S INFIDELITY.

SPATS, MRS. L/1 WAS USUALLY THE AGGRESSOR, WITH L/1 TRYING TO

KEEP PEACE OR SIMPLY REMAINING QUIET.

MRS.. L/1 ALSO GOT INTO

ARGUMENTS WITH SOME OF THE PALESTINIAN MERCHANTS IN

7.

ONE OTHER ASPECT OF L/L'S FAMILY WHICH F/86 FOUND

DISAGREEABLE WAS BEHAVIOR OF L/1'S OLDER DAUGHTER.

F/86 AND

HIS WIFE WERE BOTH OFFENDED BY DAUGHTER'S FREQUENT SEXUAL

REFERENCES IN FRONT OF F/86'S YOUNGER CHILDREN. F/86 SAID THAT

L/1'S DAUGHTER ACTED JUST LIKE A CUBAN HOOKER.

8. ON A MORE ELEVATED PLANE, F/86 ALSO HAD SOME PRIVATE

PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH L/1.

TO F/86'S DIRECT QUESTION, L/1 SAID THAT THE WRITERS WHO HAVE

INFLUENCED HIM THE MOST ARE MARX, HEGEL AND KANT.

THAT LENIN'S MAIN ACHIEVEMENT WAS TO RECOGNIZE NEED FOR ONLY

ONE PARTY.

L/1 CONSIDERS LENIN TO HAVE BEEN AN INTEPRETER OF

MARX BUT NOT A GREAT THEORETICIAN. TO SOME EXTENT, L/1

EFENDED LENIN'S SO-CALLED "LAW OF ECONOMIC PRUDENCE", A MEAN

F ECONOMIC PLANNING WHICH LENIN UNSUCCESSFULLY ATTEMPTED T

IMPLEMENT IN USSR.

AFTER LENIN'S DEATH, IT BECAME EXCESSIVELY

BUREAUCRATIZED AND ATROPHIED.

ALTHOUGH THIS SYSTEM DID WORK

WITH SOME SUCCESS IN BULGARIA.

L/1 ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED NEED FOR "NEOLIBERAL MEDICINE" TO

REFORM CUBAN ECONOMY, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER SOLUTION.

ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT REFORMS SHOULD BE INSTITUTED WITH MINIMUM

SOCIAL AND POLITICAL COSTS. WHILE STATE SHOULD NOT BE

EXCESSIVELY INTERVENTIONIST IN ECONOMY, L/ 1 WANTS STATE TO

HAS INS TSUBRSTECTIVE SOCIAL ROLE, BECAUSE MARKET ECONOMY ALSO

HAS ITS FAULTS.

10. L/1 TALKED ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN E.

KENNEDY. ACCORDING TO L/1, IN 1969, L/1 PERSONALLY SAW FIDEL

CASTRO RECEIVE A GROUP OF U.S. RADICALS. CASTRO TALKED TO THEM

FOR TWO HOURS ABOUT WHY JUST ONE ASSASSIN COULD NOT POSSIBLY

HAVE KILLED KENNEDY.

CRIME, USING HIS BEST MARKSMEN ARD THEY CONCERO DUTICATE

*WHAT LEE HARVEY OSWALD>SUPPOSEDLY DID BY HIMSELF.

L/1 SAID

THAT THREE GROUPS WERE INVOLVED IN KILLING THE PRESIDENT:

ONE

GROUP OF CUBANS, ONE GROUP O "MAFIOSOS" AND A THIRD GROUP OF

MERCENARIES .

THE THIRD GROUP INCLUDED A MAN WITH A GREEK

NAME. I/1 TOLD F/86 THAT IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER ANY OF THESE
