] Cubela was met again ins Paris, France, in

September and October 1963 during which he discussed actions he
might take against the Castro regime. During these discussions
Cubela requested a high powered rifle with telescopic sites which
could be used to kill Castro; the request was turned down with the
admonition by the person to whom he was talking (who represented
himself as speaking for Robert Kennedy) that the U. S. did not do
such things.

In late 1963, as Cubela had continued to express interest in
equipment, various courses of action were considered. Finally, a
ballpoint pen was rigged as a hypodermic syringe that could be

: oe) used to administer poison. A CIA case officer met with Cubela on
22 November 1963 in Paris, at which time he delivered the pen.
This was the very date upon which President Kennedy was assassinated
in Dallas, Texas.

Relationships with Cubela continued, including his eventually
being supplied with arms, both by cache in Cuba and personal
delivery by an intermediary in Spain. In June 1965 CIA decided to
terminate contacts with Cubela and his foae because of concern
over their security. Cubela's arrest was announced on 1 March
1966 and he was tried publicly, at which time he confessed, although

his associations with CIA were not made a part of his public confession.
