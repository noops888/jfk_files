Manuel Ray Rivoro, leader of the JURE, arrived in Miami by
_air fron Puerto Rico ‘on 11 August, and planned to return to
Puerto Rico the game day, The purpose of bis visit was to
make’ an effort to reach an understanding with the men who
arrived on the VENUS. According to Ray, he bad given Rabel
$720 (U.S.) for expenses of the boat, but instead Rabel had
used the money to come to Miami, Ray considered this use of
JURE funds an act of treason. Ray held a meeting at the JURE
officete discuss what steps ahould be. taken about Rabel’e
action. The following meq attended the meeting:

Osorio Davila Santana
poeretied a Germinal Rivas
1 Alfredo Perez Allan
Lorenzo Hulz
Two other men, 7

Rabel ‘said that by bringing the boats to Miami he had demonstrated
to Ray that he (Rabel) was in complete command of the boats,

“Jie expreased his defiance of any effort on Ray's part to board

the vessel, He added that he could not come to an agreement
with Ray because of the latter's cowardice; that Ray had been
‘collecting money and fooling the Cuban people for three years.

Since Bie arrival in Miami, Rabel bas visited Manuel Varela
Castro,2 former military chief of the JURE who resigned after

differences with Rays

Rabel plans to solicit money in Miami to carry on the struggle
against Fidel Castro Ruz, lle anid that Antonio Imbert Barrera,
head of the Loyalist Forces in the Dominican Republic, has

pro d to help in the struggle, and that as soon as, the boats
are ready they will return to the Dominican Republic.
