MAGADDINO explained to LOFFA and SCIA that he helped

JOHN PAPALIA, a Canadian, 1s currently confined at

Lewisburg Penitentiary after a Federal narcotics conviction.

Arter discussing how well he, MAGADDINO, has always

handled problems of others in the past,

he began speaking of

a more familiar topic, 1.e, the events that took place after

the alleged kidnaping of JOSEPH BONANNO.

MAGADDINO made reference to attempts by CHARLES BATTAGLIA

in shoenix to contact his cousin in Burialo.

This cousin may be

SALVATORE "SAM" PIERI, a member of the MAGADDINO "Family" who

was incarcerated in Atlanta Penitentiary on federal narcotics

charges with VITO GENOVESE, JOSEPH VALACHI and

ANTHONY CHRISCI,

aka

lony Chris

MAGADDINO explained that a "TONY CRISTO".

(or CREST Or CRESTA) was told by BATTAGLIA of his being unable

to see his cousin in Buffalo.

Later BATTAGLIA called his cousin

by telephone from Phoenix and the cousin reported this telephone

call to MAGADDINO, who figured that BATTAGLIA was in Arizona

wich either JOSEPH or BILL BONANNO.

MAGADDINO calls BATTAGLIA all sorts of names and said

that BATTAGLIA's wife was having, an affair with BATTAGLIA's

brother: (Page 44)

It appears that the above concerns information previously

reported by LA 4335-C-TE relating to BATTAGLIA's attempts to

contact MAGADDINO through SAM PIERI.

Once again MAGADDINO describes the events leading up

to the dismissal of JOSEPH BONANNO by the Commission. He

elaborates on his previously reported

comments on this matter

particularly the apparent suicide of "MARCO ANGELO" because of

BONANNO.

He also interjects the purpose of a visit of his

"brother-in-law GASPARINO" whom he has identified previously

as both brother-ih-law and cousin. (Page 68)

PAUL SCIA adds that GASPARINO visited the United States

about twelve to seventeen years ago when the father of VINCENZINO

D'ANNA died.

GASPARINO mentioned he is in all likelihood GASPAR

MAGADDINO of Sicily.
