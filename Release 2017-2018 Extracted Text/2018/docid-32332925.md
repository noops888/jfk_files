SEBASTIAN JOHN

ANTI-RACKETEERING

(00: Pittsburgh)

â€¢ ReBuairtel to New York, 2/1/61.

In accordance with Bureau instructions, a thorough review

of all information in the files of the Pittsburgh Office

relating to SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA has been conducted.

This review has encompassed information developed in

our Criminal Intelligence Program and that information

gleaned from informants: as well as information being

received on a continuing basis from a highly confidential

source at LA ROCCA's place of business, the North Star

Cement Block Company, 12 Mc Candless Avenue, Pittsburgh.

This source was activated on 2/7/61:

In answer to specific questions set forth in reairtel:

1. LA ROCCA 1s not presently the subject of a sub-

stantive case, nor is any process--local, state

or Federal, currently outstanding against him.

2. At present the subject is seeking to squelch any

publicity concerning himself, according to Informants

A slight possibility exists that employees may become

involved in ITSP violations in view of the fact

that LA ROCCA prefers to hire state parolees as

truck drivers at his cement block plant. Pittsburgh

will remain alert to discover any vulnerable area

wherein there is a possibility of establishing a

violation within the Bureau's jurisdiction against

LA ROCCA.
