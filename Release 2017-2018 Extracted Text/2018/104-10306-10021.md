Keats atone titsation Operations

1. Cuba - Propose

The infiltration/exfiltration operations in the January 1964
forecast were approved. Three sabotage operations, numbers 3111,
414, and 417, were approved by the Speciai Group subject to the
concurrence of higher authority. Decision was deferred on a sabotage
operation, ‘number 413, against the petroleum refinery and storage
facilities'near Santiago. Mr. Johnson said that before he could
exercise judgment as to the importance of this operation he must have
an analysis as to what effect the total or partial destruction of.
this refinery would have on Cuban petroleum production and economy
generally. The Group agreed that such an analysis shoule be prepared
and be presented along with this sabotage operation for Special Group
action at its next meeting.

- Infiltration/Exfiltration Operations During December 1963.

Mr. FitzGerald reviewed the accomplishments during the month of
December. He emphasized a successful exfiltration activity of a
recently activated ratline. This is the second time in two moaths
that this ratline has successfully exfiltrated agents in danger of
errest. He also gave a resume of the underwater cemolition operation
{number 3117) which damaged a Cuban PT boat {So t-type P-6). Also,
during the same operation self-destroying anti-bcat mines were placed
in the harbor eatrance to. ibit pursuit. Cne of the mines was detected

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Gilpatric, and Mr. McCone.

The Attorney General and Mr. FitzGerald were present
for Items 1 and 2.
’

Colonel Steakley and Mr. Kiefer were present for Item 3.

1. Guba - Consideration of Sabotage Operations.

Mr. FitzGerald requested the Special Group to approve a sabotage
operation against the petroleum refinery and storage facilities near
Santiago. The proposal was disapproved.

Another sabotage proposal was made by Mr. FitzGerald against a
sawmill located on the north coast of Oriente Province. The attack
is to be conducted by a commando team which will place incendiaries
and demolitions at critical locations throughout the installation.
A second target, which may be attacked as security factors permit, is
a large floating crane which has been anchored in the area and which
appears to be used in loading ore from a near-by mine. This operational
proposal with its ‘two targets was approved subject to the concurrence of
higher authority. Also, it was the consensus of the Group that the
views of higher authority should be obtained on what ‘is desired generally
in the field of sabotage activities in Cuba.

2. . Cuba - Proposed Clandestine Intelligence Operations.

The Department of the Army requested approval for two operations:
(a) the establishment of a clandestine net using the Second National
-Front of the Escambray, and (b) the infiltration of a radio operator
agent into Cuba. CIA has agreed to provide support for both these
proposals. The two operations were approved.

The JRC paper dated 8 January 1964 was approved as amended.
No change was made in the following BOX TOP missions: Jane, Paula,
Ruby, Eric, Marvin, Frank, Dwight, Lloyd, Karl, Everett, and Hugh.
Operations Cliff and Alf were amended resulting in the cancellation
of Operation Cliff. Mission Calvin's track was changed permitting
it to approach the Latvian coast no closer than 25 nautical miles
rather than 20 miles as originally proposed.

,

Mr. McCone raised the question of the increasing number of flights
authorized by the JRC. Colonel Steakley said that the number of sup-
porting flights required for every reconnaissance platform was largely
responsible for the increase. He also pointed out that there is
currently a review of COMOR requirements for Cuba being prepared to
determine whether they can be eased in order to permit a considerably
lessened operational schedule >]

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of the Special Group Meeting, 13 February 1964

PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Vance, and Mr. McCone.

General Maxwell D. Taylor, Mr. Thomas A. Mann, and
Mr. Desmond FitzGerald were present for Item l.

Lt. General Marshall A. Carter was present for
Items 1 and 2.

1. Cuba - Covert Activities.

A lengthy discussion took place on covert action potential
to weaken the Castro regime. The first part of the discussion
constituted an exchange of opinion of a general nature.

The following points were emphasized: Continued covert
action received support although divergence on the level of
activity was registered. There was a consensus that the present
level of operations was no longer effective ia attaining the
basic objective of toppling Castro but harassment might keep
the regime off balance. There was an area of disagreement on
proofs of effectiveness of current and past measures.

Mr. Bundy summarized the dilemma by noting that the high
risk, dangerous operations are the rewarding ones and the low
noise, innocuous: operations prove to be unrewarding.

Mr. Mann emphasized that considerably more homework had
to be completed before the next OAS meeting (presently unscheduled).
Mr. Bundy indicated that a Cabinet level meeting with higher
authority would have to be held eventually to determine how far
the United States was willing to go. Mr. Bundy turned the discussion
to the specific Department of Defense paper.

On Sabotage, Mr. Vance stated that he could speak for
the Secretary of Defense; his attitude had turned to a harder
line. :

On Harassment of Free World Shipping to Cusi, para-
graph 2.a. was considered work in progress. O« paragraph 2.b.
the attitude was negative, particularly as to ps of other
than Cuban flag.

Hl On Covert Economic Activities, paragraph 3.a. is
part of the present program. Paragraphs 3.b. and c.
are parc of an overall blacklisting problem which remains
to be explored.

On Encouraging Dissidence Among Factions, the
consensus was to intensify these activities.

Actions against Ciiban Subversion in Latin America,
paragraphs 1 and 2: A good look should be taken at this
type of activity and a determination should be made on a

country-by-country and case-by-case basis.

On the last paragraph of the paper, it was decided -
that these efforts constitute work in progress with the
exception of shipping surveillance which is under active
study by the Departmenc of Defense. A paper on this
problem will be ready next week. It was understood that
this was an expression of members' opinion on types of ~-
action but that’ specific operational proposals would be
submitted to the Special Group as heretofore.

Mr. Bundy then asked Mr. Mann to prepare papers covering
the major issues of Caribbean surveillance, the blacklisting
of firms trading with Havana, covert actions, and types of
retaliation.

Review Programs

On the review programs for Japan, France, Tibet, Taiwan,
and China, it was agreed that the papers as prepared were the
most useful way to present the material to members. Mr. Vance
indicated he had a number of questions in depth but that he would
not take the time at this meeting. Mr. McCone then directed that
the area specialists would be made available at Mr. Vance's con-
venience to answer any questions he might have. Mr. Bundy
concluded that since a time factor was not-involved, formal approval
of these papers could be made at a future meeting. Mr. Johnson
remarked that State had already registered its approval.

Cuba - Proposed Operations during April 1964.

i In discussing the proposed Cuban operations for the month of
‘April 1964 and three separate papers submitted to all members for
noting, the following conclusions were reached: The five infiltra-
-tion/fexfiltration operations were approved as were the five caching
operations, However, the five sabotage proposals were tabled.

Referring to the paper entitled, "Status of Sabotage and Raiding
Capability against Cuba," Mr. FitzGerald emphasized the. economic and
morale aspects of maintaining this potential and the influences of
deterioration when it remains in stand-by status. Mr. Bundy then
stated that the time'was overdue for submitting to higher authority
the entire question of covert operations against Cuba. The problem
of autonomous exile groups and their potential for conducting oper-
ations on their own and the momentum of these groups even if support
: should be cut off was also discussed. It was clear that the groups
4° headed by Artime and Ray constitute a considerable threat.

- Mr. Bundy indicated that next week he would call a meeting with
higher authority and the Secretaries of Defense and State. Mr.
FitzGerald would outline the current status of operations against
Cuba, and it was hoped that definite policy lines could be determined
for future covert activity against Castro.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT: Overflight of Cuba on 1 May

1. Although it may, in fact, have little substance, the thought occurs
that if Castro is seriously considering a "shoot-down" of a U-2, from
a propaganda standpoint he could not select a better time than 1 May,
the traditional Communist holiday, and more significantly the Fourth
“Anniversary of the "infamous" Francis Gary Powers incident.

2. From a psychological viewpoint, identification of a new U-2

shoot-down with that incident on May Day four years ago might have ‘
-. considerable appeal to Fidel and might. conceivably influence his judg-. ©
ment in reaching a determination to take such action, nS

3. Recognizing that this association is rather tenuous, it might
. still be worth considering a stand-down of U-2 overflights on that one
day. This would not seriously impair our intelligence effort and it
would deprive Castro of the opportunity to exploit this rather unique
circumstance should he have any inclination to do so. KF

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Minutes of the Meeting of the 303 Committee, 18 June 1964
PRESENT: Mr. Bundy, Mr. McCone, Mr. Vance, Mr. Johnson.

Mr. Mann and Mr. FitzGerald were also present.

A general discussion was held on problems arising from increased
activities on the part of organized Cuban emigre groups, independent
adventurers, purported plots to assassinate Castro and the general edginess
and instability on the island.

None of those present appeared to feel that it was either realistic or
practical to sever connections with or to withdraw support from the two
principal emigre organizations, those of Artime and Ray.

The recent escapades and overall capabilities of Manolo Ray were
deplored but it was agreed first: that steps should be taken to get the Puerto
Rican authorities to release his ship; second: that he should be promptly
advised in accordance with the stated policy established by the late President
to cease forthwith all activities from the United States Mainland and find
himself a new base of operations; third: no monies would be forthcoming,
specifically a requested $25,000, until point two above has been accomplished.
No help was to be offered in finding Ray a new Caribbean base, Mr. Mann
was particularly interested that Ray not be encouraged to transfer to the
Dominican Republic because of the fragility of the regime.

The next subject discussed was the recent visit of Major Oliva to both
the Attorney General and Assistant Secretary Mann. It was pointed out that
Oliva is both a zealot and a man of integrity and that his only interest in life
is leading a return to his homeland. Any attempts to put Oliva into business
would be expensive and undesirable at this time. It was decided that
Mr. Bundy would ask the Attorney General if he would be willing to dampen
Oliva's ardor.

The activities of Artime from Nicaragua were discussed next. Alexis
Johnson pointed out that Artime raids could conceivably provoke Castro into
utilizing Cuban SAM sites; he said this possibility should not be discounted.
But it was also pointed out that Artime's recent sugar mill raid succeeded
in leading Castro to mobilize many persons involved in important sugar
harvesting and thus constituted a successful economic warfare byproduct.



It was estimated that Artime's schedule of. one operation per month was
overly optimistic; one every three months was about all Artime could
accomplish, The decision was to drive home to Artime that his greatest
value was not in hazardous hit-and-run actions but in his survival as a
continuing psychological threat in being.

Mr. FitzGerald, in discussing the current situation in Cuba, stated that
he believed the regime was in considerable difficulty. There has beena
large increase in the number of executions and mass arrests. He also cited
the fact that an entire CIA Pinar del Rio net has been rolled up by Castro's
security forces and the key man executed. The sugar and crop prospects
were not good, the world price having dropped. Some of the members were
surprised at this picture and stated it did not seem to conform to the daily
bulletins. Mr. McCone said that he would ask for a SNIE on the current
situation in Castro Cuba.

A paper was discussed on alleged plans which involve the underworld
to assassinate certain Cuban leaders, Mr. McCone was somewhat skeptical
of the reported plots and stated that he would like to go into the matter further.
Others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the United States was being put on
notice and should do everything in its power to ascertain promptly the veracity
of the reports and then undertake prevention. It was decided that Mr. Bundy
would call'the matter to the Attorney General's attention as a matter of law
enforcement. :
