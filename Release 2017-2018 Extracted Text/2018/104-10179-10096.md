1. Ray did not return to Washington until early morning on Friday,

12 May 1961. He called me at 0700 from the airport. He was unable

to fin a definita hour for ue lo got together due to the fact that he was

expecting an appointment with a person he did not name some time

during the morning.

He later called a number of timee from the Hotel

Ambassador to advise me that he still had had no word on his appoint

mont. At 1145, Mr. Betascourt called to say that he was with Ray

and "Eugenio" (Rogolio Cioneros) and could we get togother. I sug

gerted they drive out to se Clarendon Hotel Court on Wileon Boulevard

where I had taken a room for holding our meeting. Thay arrived in

to the proper people at the earlies: poadible simo a carefully thoughe

out plan of action which would set forib clearly the objectives - what

he projoct hoped to achieve; a statement of the problem; the strength:

§ the Castro regime following the ill-fatad invasion; the statue of th

underground and its morale and capabilitles; the extent of Internal

support for and discontent with the regime, etc., etc.

4. I also spoke of the need for deseribing the kind of activities

which the Ray organization planned to engage in and the assete and

capabilities which they have or can acquire to do the job.

The need for

explaining the relationahip and coordination of the plas with the Revolu-

tionary Council was discurned at some length.

5. I suggested that ho include in the plan an itemination of the kinde

of support which he would expect us to supply immediately as well as the

kind and quantity of support which would be required of un as the project

developed.

6. I also suggested that the plan Include their views on how U. S.

lindoon and coordination could best be worked out; how funds would be

funneled into the project; what commo and other training would be re-

quired; whothar U.'S. "real estato" would be needed, etc.

J. Ray outlined some of his thoughts regarding hio proposed plan

of action. According to him it contemplates action in three broad flolde:

(a) Underground activity - principally sabotage - in the

urban areas.

(b) Gradual bulldup • largely through clandeetine Infiltra-

tions of small bodies of men - of guerrilla force, in mountala

ous and defensible areas.

(e) A psychological warfaro campalga within Cube and abroad

aimed at discrediting Castro and ni the oume line providing the

people of Cuba something 8o light for.

3. Is la Ray's Intention to depend almoat entirely on maritime opera

done for the Infiltration of permennel and materiol into Cuba. He alec

rules out of hão plan the creation of another invadios army but does con-

template the training of groups of perhaps up lo 150 men in other friendly

countries of South America (he mentioned Venesuela as a possibility)

and said he would oxplora the possibility of basing maritime operationa

in non-U. S. ports.

• Ray said some means, other than Swan laland, must be foun

lor reaching the Cuban population by radie broadeasts. Ho spoke o

the possibility of short wave broadcaste from Veneruela and uilliza-

llon of a commercial station in Miami which he understande can be

clearly hoard.in Cuba.

10. Ray spoke of the denireability of stimulating the organisation

of "Pro-True Cuban Revolutionary" student groups in many countries

of Latin Amorica (he said a succresful organization has been formed

da Puerto Rico) and of sending quallfied representatives to those Latin

Amorican countries where there in Soviet diplomatic representation to

contaci student and labor groupe and leaders in an effort to present to

them the true picture of the sorry state of students, workers, and

intellectuals in Castro's Cuba.

11.

Ray la also interested in the possibility of putting out a "Newe

Lotter" under MRP sponsorahip which would discuss various aspecte of

the Cubas picture and set forth plana for Cuba after the fall of Castro.

Ho thought such a newe letter could god long way towarde correcting

Indstaken Impressions among American university professore and in

other circles as to the true nature of the Castro regime. He pointed

to the recent letter from 53 Marvard professors which was recontly

published in the N. Y. Times ao a "horrible example" as to how mia-

Informed even univereity professors are on present day Cuba.

12. Wbon the diecussiona got around to the need for conducting

operations as leaßt "under the umbrella" of the Revolutionary Council,

and the need for obtaining Dr. Miro'a concurrence before the U. S.

would be able to support any operation, it was obvious that neitber

Ing. Ray nor Mir. Betancourt holde a high impressloa of the Council.

Both fool that there in a strong ponmibility that the close public

identlication of the Counch with the recent invasion may well have

discredited the Council to such an extent that it commanda no suppors

os respoci misala Cuba.

For lo unko of argument they were willing to concede that tha

unity of the various oxile groupe may well outwolgh ite other obvious

shortcomings. However, both foel, and Mr. Betancourt was quite

emphatic on thie point, that the Council as a body la not capable of

directing clandestino actiona againat Castro and as a matter of fact

is opposed to any further efforta at overthrowing Castro by sabotage

and other subversive actione since they are completely "sold" on

the theale that Castro can only be removed by direct U.S. military

action and therefore a continuation of Cuban underground activities

can only result in needlees and futile lose of life. In the fact of this

attitude, Ray said he does not expect to receive much encouragement

for his plan from the Council, although he in fairly confident that

DI. Miro's approval can eventually be obtained.

Ms. Betancourt thought that a workable solution might be found

to thair problem if the Council would agree to concern iteolf exclusively

with (a) the current taok of undying the opposition, and (b) planning for

ite future sanumption of power as the provisional government. Under

this arrangement, oporations aimed at the downfall of Castro could be

entrusted to those leaders and groupe (ouch sa the MRP, MRR, and

possibly the MDC) which have both the susets and the will to do the

Job. Mr. Ray thought that it might be feasible to create an operations

planning board or command among the groups with demonstrated assets

and thus avoid unnecesary duplication and confusion and make possiblo

overall planning. It was obvioue, however, that he would prefer to ac:

autonomoualy in the execution of his program.

Mr. Ray was very critical of Artime and cisimed he was in possession

of mufficiont 'Yacts" to convince him that Astime, in collusion with ele-

menta of the camps, were planning to eliminate tho MRP and it= leadere

from the picture, when the invasion succeeded. He said he "known"

that Artime was being financially supported by wealthy ex-Batistianos

of the Miami area-

13, Ray hinted at various times that the MRP may at some potat

kind itself faced with the necossity al withdrawing from the Council and

going it alone. He says that the Council in composed of "goud men" but

they have no assete or significant followinge and "have nothing to offer

the people of Cuba" and although the proclamation of the Council, an

finally drafted, was a good one the "progrenaive" aspecta of the proclam-

ation were forced on the Council by the Americans and do not represent

the true feelings of the majority of the Council membero: He said the.

promises mare bi the riggent menhership of the council. He feels

that acceptance of the Council would be improved by adding to ita

membership two or three more people whose names would be signi-

ficant and meaningful to the Guban people. He did not name any

specific candidates.

14. Mr. Ray lot mo read a 13 or 14 page report which he had

bonitos" in the invasion force; conveyed the strong feeling that the

Cubane had baen betrayed by the Americans; and indicated that while

the MRP organisation was still pretty much intact physically, morale

was almost completaly shattered. Ms. Ray said he would provide me

a sanitized copy (there were some operational and personal details)

of the report for our information.

15.

In view of this report from within Cuba, Mi. Ray said that

he will wiah to defer aubmitting his plan for our consideration until

he is able to receive word from Cuba concerning the capabilities,

willingness and feasibility of carrying out some of the activities he

has in mind.

He said it la useless to submit a program of action li

the human elements to carry it out are lacking or completoly demoral-

ized. He thought he might be able to present his prospoctur within

approximately ten days. He said naturally be will not giva the people

Laside any indication that he has been discuesing a plan of action with

16. I urged Ray to consider submitting at least a preliminary and

admirtedly tentative proppectus at this time based on the aseumption

that his aosets aro still intact and will be willing to cooperate in order

that it may receive early consideration. However, he stuck to his

pole enatchion old not bength trial and reiterated the ed for

wondered if they have been relensed. He was told that as far as I

know they are still under detention.. He said Mr. Goodwin had taken

their names and promised to look into the master. Mr. Botancourt

sald he would check directly with Mr. Goodwin se their statua.

18. Jinvied Mir. Ray and/or Mr. Betancourt to call me over

the weekend in case either should want to diecuss the matter further.

I had the feeling that Mi. Betancourt was personally in favor of aub-

mitting now a plan covering "short term" needs of their organization

and it may be thas such a paper will be submitted alier ho has an

oppostunity to talk with Mr. Ray in private.
