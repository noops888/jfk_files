1, Ray did not return to Washington until early morning on Friday,
12 May 1961. He called me at 0700 from the airport. He was unable
to fix a definite hour for us to got together due to the fact that he was
expecting an appointment with a person he did not name some time
during the morning. He later called a number of timee from the Hotel
Ambsssador to advise me that he otill had had no word on his appoint-
ment. At 1145, Mr, Betancourt called to say that he wae with Ray
and "Eugenio" (Rogelio Cisneros) and could we get together, I sug-
gested they drive out to -ae Clarendon Hotel Court on Wilson Boulevard
where I had taken a room for holding our meeting. They arrived ia
Mr, Betancourt's car at approximately 1230 noon time and we first
went to the nearby Hogate Restaurant on Wilson Boulevard for lunch
before we got down to the bus: of the prospectus,

2. During lunch we did not divcues the plan but I did take the op-
portunity to a} in a most serious way the need for absolute secrecy

concerning our discussions today and any future
opments which might take place in the future with respect to our relation-
ship, All agreed on the need for tight security: -

3. After lunch we drove to the Hotel Court and from approximately
1330 until 1750, we discussed the prospectus, Using Mr. Barnes! out-
line ag a general guide, I stressed the importance of being able to preeent

to the proper poople at the earliest possible time a carefully thought-
out plen of action which would set forth clearly the objectives -- what
the project hoped to achieve; a statement of the problem; the strengths
of the Castro regime following the ill-fated invasion; the statue of the
underground and ite morale and capabilities; the extent of internal
support for and discontent with the regime, etc., etc.

4, Taleo spoke of the need for describing the kind of activities
which the Ray organization planned to engage in and the assets and
capabilities which they have or can acquire to do the Job, The need for :
explaining the relationship and coordination of the plan with the Revolu-
tionary Council was discussed at some length.

$. Tsuggested that ho include in tha plan an itemization of the kinds
of support which he would expect us to supply immediately ae well as the
kind and quantity of support which would be required of us as the project

developed.

6. Taleo suggested that the plan include their views on how U. S.
liaison and coordination could best be worked out; how funds would be
funneled into the project; what commo and other training would be re-
quired; whethar U,'5, "real estate” would be noeded, etc.

1, Ray outlined some of his thoughts regarding his proposed plan
According to him it contemplates action in three broad fields:

of action.
{a} Underground activity -- principally sabotage ~~ in the
urban areas, :

(>) Gradual butldup -- largely through elendestine infiltra~
tone of sma)l bodies of men -- of guerrilla forces in mountaia-
ous and defensible areas. : -

(c) A psychological warfare campaign within Cuba and abroad
Aimed at discrediting Castro and at the same time providing the

people of Cubs something to fight for.

\

8. It is Ray's intention to depend almost entirely on maritime opera-
tions for the infiltration of perscnnel and materiel into Cuba, He also :
rules out of his plan the creation of another invasion army but does con- ‘
template the training of groups of perhaps up to 150 men in other friendly iy

countries of South America (he mentioned Venesuela possibility)
and said he would oxplore the possibility of bacing maritime operations

im non-U. 5, porta,

9. Ray said some means, other than Swan Island, must be found
for reaching the Cuban population by radi broadeaets. He epoke of
the possibility of short wave broadcasts from Venexuela and utiliza-
tlon of a commercial station in Miami which he understande can be
clearly heard-in Cuba.

10, Ray spoke of the desireability of stimulating the organisation
of "Pro-True Cuban Revolutionary" student groups in many countries
of Latin America (he said a successful organization has been formed
in Puarto Rico) and of sending qualified representatives to those Latin
American countries where there is Soviet diplomatic representation to
contact student and labor groups aad leaders in an effort to present to
them the true picture of the sorry state cf students, workers, and
intellectuals in Castro's Cuba.

11. Ray Js also interested in the pessibility of putting out a "Newe
Letter" under MRP sponsorship which would discuss various aspecte of
the Cuban picture and set forth plans for Cuba after the fall of Castro.
He thought such a pews letter could go » long way towards correcting
mistaken impressions among American university professors and in
other circles as to the true nature of the Castro regime. He pointad
to the recent letter from $3 Harvard professors which was recently
published in the N. Y. Times ae a "horrible example" se to how mie~
informed even university professors are on present day Cuba.

12, When the discussions got around to the need for conducting
operations at least "under the umbrella” of the Revolutionary Council,
and the need for obtaining Dr. Miro's concurrence before the U. S.
would be able to support any operation, it wae obvious that neither
Ing. Ray nor Mr. Betancourt holde a high impreeeioa of the Council.
Both fee} that there is a strong possibility that the close public
identification of the Council with the recent invasion may well have
iscredited the Council to such an extent that it commands no support

or respect withia Cuba, +

For the sake of argument they were willing to concede that the
political advantages of maintaining the Cuunci) for the purpose-of forcing

unity of the various oxile groupe may well outweigh its other obvious
shortcomings, However, both feel, and Mr. Betancourt wae quite
emphatic on this point, that the Council as a body ie not capable of
directing clandestine actions against Castro and as a matter of fact
is opposed to any further efforts at overthrowing Castro by sabotage
and other subversive actions since they are completely "sold" on
the thesis that Castro can only be removed by direct U. S, military
action and therefore s continuation of Cuban underground activities
can only result in needless and futile lose of life, In the factof this
attitude, Ray said he does not expect to receive much encouragement
for his plan {rom the Council, although he ie fairly confident that
Dr. Miro's approval can eventually be obtained,

Mx, Betancourt thought that a workable solution might be found
to their problem if the Council would agree to concern itsolf exclusively
with (a) the current task of unifying the opposition, and (b) planning for
ite future assumption of power as the provisional government. Under
this arrangement, operations aimed at the downfall of Castro could be
entrusted to thoge leaders and groupe (such ae the MRP, MRR, and
posaibly the MDC) which have both the assets and the will to do the
job, Mr, Ray thought that it might be feasible to create an operations
planning board or command among the gfoupa with demonstrated assets
and thus avoid unnecessary duplication and confusion and make possible
overa)] planning. MR was obvious, however, that he would préfer to act
autonomously in the execution of his program,

Mr, Ray wae very critical of Artime and claimed he was in possession
of sufficient "facts" to convince him that Artime, in collusion with ele-
mente of the.camps, were planning to eliminate the MRP and its leaders
from the picture, when the invasion succeeded. He eaid he "knows"
that Artime was being financially supported by wealthy ex-Datistianos

of the Miami area.

13, Ray hinted at various times that the MRP may at some point
find iteelf faced with the necessity of withdrawing from the Council and-
going it alone. He saye that tht Council is composed of "good men" but
they have no assets or significant followinge’and “have nothing to offer
the people of Cubs" and although the proclamation of the Council, as
finally drafted, was a good one the "progressive" aspects of the proclam-
ation were forced on the Council by the Americans and do not repr.
the true feelings of the majority of the Council members; He said



Cuban people are not likely to want to risk their lives on the basis of
promises made by the prasent membership of the Council. He feels
that acceptance of the Council would be improved by adding to ite
membership two or three more people whose names would he signi-
ficant and meaningful to the Cuban people. He did not name any
specific candidates.

14, Mr. Ray let me read a 13 or 14 page rt which he
Just received from the MRP coordinator in Cuba| ob
which painted a dreary picture of conditions in ry

of the invasion; was critical of the inclusion of Batietianos and “ninos
bonitos"t in the invasion force; conveyed the strong feeling that the
Cubans had been betrayed by the Americans; and indicated that while
the MRP organization waa still pretty much intact physically, morale
was almost completely shattered, Mr, Ray said he would provide me
& sanitized copy (there were some operational and personal details)
of the report for our information,

15, In view of thie report from within Cuba, Mr, Ray eaid that
he will wish to defer submitting his plan for our consideration until
he is able to receive word from Cuba concerning the capabilities,
willingness and feasibility of carrying out some of the activities he
hae in mind, He said it is useless to submit a program of action if

the human elements to carry it out are Jacking or completely demoral~

ized. He thought he might be able to present his prospectus within
approximately ten days, He caid naturally he will not give the people
inside any indication that he has been discussing a plan of action with

us.

16, Lurged Ray to consider submitting at least a preliminary and
admittedly tentative proppectus at this time based on the aseumption
that his assets aro still intact and will be willing to cooperate in order
that it may receive early consideration, However, he stuck to his
belief tnat this would not be practicable and reiterated the nee
prior evaluation of the strength and morale of his following,.*

17, Ray
wondered if they have been re d. He was told that as fa:
know they are stil] under detention, He eaid Mr. Goodwin had taken
their names and promised to look into the matter, Mr, Betancourt

rea esay

said he would check directly with Mr. Goodwin re their statua.

18, Iinvited Mr. Ray and/or Mr. Betancourt to call me over
the weekend in case either should want to diecuss tho matter further.
Thad the feeling that Mr. Betancourt was personally in favor of eub-
mitting now a plan covering "short term" needs of their organization
and it may be that euch a paper will bs submitted after he hae an
opportunity to talk with Mr, Ray in private.
