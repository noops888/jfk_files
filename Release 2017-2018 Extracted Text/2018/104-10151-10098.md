48. (Confidential - DFM) BRIEFING Briefed Bill Miller, Staff

Director, and Earl Eisenhower, Minority Staff Director, Senate Select

Committee on Intelligence, on the 8 November 1977 Presidential finding.

Miller asked why this problem could not be handled overtly. I attempted

to explain this to him but he indicated he was certain the subject would

be raised by the full Committee when the Director briefs them on the

program.

I told Miller the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct had

some problems in funding the trip of Jocko Richardson, former Chief of

Station,

, to Washington to be interviewed by that Committee

as well as the Senate Select Committee. I asked Miller if the Select Committee

could do this in a secure manner. Miller said he thought they could and

there would be no problem in the Committee paying the expenses. I

told him I would check again and let him know if this was necessary..

Miller said he had talked to Chairman Daniel K. Inouye (D., Hawaii)

about the classified FOIA affidavits which Senator James Abourezk

(D., S. Dak.) has requested. Miller said the Chairman's position was

that we were not denying Senator Abourezk information, and had suggested

a reasonable means for him to examine the material, i. e., in the Select

Committee offices. In Senator's Inouye's view, there is no reason for us

to try to be any more accommodating.

I told Miller that General Camm, Director of the National

Intelligence Tasking Center, would like to meet with Select Committee

staffers sometime during the week of 28 November and that we would like …

to include staff members of both the Subcommittee on Budget and Authorization

and the Subcommittee on Collection, Production and Quality. Miller

agreed and said that he would set this up and let me know.

Regarding the scheduled briefing on Czechoslovak dissidents,

Miller said Select Committee participants would be himself, Earl Eisenhower

and Ed Levine.

49. (Unclassified - DFM) LIAISON Met with Mike Epstein, Senate

Select Committee on Intelligence staff, to advise him that Gary Cornwell,

House Select Committee on Assassinations staff, wants to review materials

given the Church Committee on the Kennedy assassination. Epstein was

already aware of this and said Cornwell was expected that afternoon to

review the transcript of the Church Committee interview with an FBI

official who was in Dallas at the time of the assassination.
