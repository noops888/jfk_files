f. The postags ia correct for Swedish internal mail and the
postags stemp is of current taaue- ‘

& A possible irregularity is the time leg between the interne)
date of the letter, the date of the postmark and the date of receipt
in the American Embessy. ‘The total timo from the internal date of
the letter to the time of recaipt is eight days, the tima between
the date of posting and the date of receipt is more then three dsys.
This transit time of more than three days for intra-city mail appears
irregular when compared with the average transit time of only two-

Be ‘three. “days for orrival between Stockholm and the United States.

3. ‘Tho ‘text of the letter warrants acme coments beceuse a monber
of ‘pacultarities were noted ~ asidw from pure spelling or typing errors =
which seem to indicate.a Swedish writer. ‘he following words represent
eitoer Swedish spelling or modification: “reserv”, “etablisned”, “nurded”,
“Krustjev"« , Other examples of Swedieh grasmsr and syntax would be:

_o “met” (as past tense}, “in Sowiet” (Svedinh form but not spelling),
“he was epy”. (without indefinite axttels) “FBI, USA" (without definite
erticle),."showla” (rather than “wola"}, “outemmgglea” (Svedish past
participle fora), ond "waole ths vorka” (pure Swedish form).

&, fe ee te the name given, “Ryo Liang Yuan".
“Ryo” 19 not a standard spelling In any known Romanization syxtem used
for Chinese. . “R" 4s seen in the new Chinese Commmnist nationsl system,
but never in combination with “yo*. “Ryo” 1s e Japanese spelling. In
the pam: given it is not known whether tha Chinese or Western presen-
tation is used, in other words, whether “Ryo“ or “Yuan“ is meant to be
the surname. Among Chinese syllables waich could be represasted by the
Jayenses "Ryo" are Liao, Liang emi Lamg. Cf these Lung (10:7893) end
Lfang (10922733) ere used os surnamed. In either case, "Ryo" is hardly
& nsme by which a real Chiness would iduntify himself.

5. In summery, end based on the above information, it in concluded
that the letter was tranmitted vin normal Swedish postal charmscls. The
letter is probably a “crank letter", mout likely written by a Swede,
using a Swedich-keyboard typewriter and Swedish stationery.
