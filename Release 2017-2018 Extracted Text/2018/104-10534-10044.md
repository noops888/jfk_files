A posaible Irregularity 15 the time leg betwen the laterael

tho letter to the time of reculpt an ulent days, the tim between

the date of posting and the date of ruceipt is nore then three days.

Inis transit time of nore than thrue days for istrt city maid appears

Irregular when campared with the averge trensit time of anty two-

turee days for arrival batween Stoulholy and the United States.

The text of the lotten rummunte acma couments because a number

of pocullarities vere noted - autau fram nure spelling of typing erora -

unich neen to indicate a stellah writer. the following words represent

either Suedish spelling or modification: "resert", "etabliched", "murded",

"Trustjar" Other examles of Sundish pams and syatas would be:

"wet. (as roat tensey,

"so Soulet" (Brainh forn but not spelling),

artiala), "shola" (rather toma "unila"),

"(without Indofinita articla" routeungles" (Swelich past

"FBI, USA" (without definite

participle fora), and "inale that murla" (piare Swedish fors).

4, Anothar sigalicant autall to the sane sives, "Ryo Liang Tian".

"Ryo" 11 not a standard polling in way loon Romanization system used

but never in combination with "yo", "Ryo" is e Japanese spelling- In

the Dams given 1t 1s not known whather the Chinese of Wester presen-

tetion i used, in other vords, whether "Ryo" or "juan" 16 meant to be

Among Chinese syllahies wilch could be reprosanted by the

Jagena, "Ryo" are LinO, LINnE alINE. CE there Inng (TO:7893) 511

In either case,

"Ryo" 1s hardly

So In sumery, and based on this above Information, It ill concluded

that the dotter vas tranmitted via nonal Swadish postal chainols. The

letter in probably a "crank luttar", mout likaly volttes by a shade,

using a swediah keyboard typoritar and Suedish stationery.
