real estate, oil leases or royalties, or securities; that he

expected to

engage in "casual real estate sales and business

opportunities' and did not expect to engage in the sale of

property located outside of Michigan.

WILLIAM HENRY GALLAGHER, 19471 Shrewsbury, Detroit 21,

and LAWRENCE I. LEVI, 19425 Argyle,

Detroit 5, both of whom are

attorneys, signed a "Recommendation" on the application,

certifying that they had known VERHELLE for at least a year and

that he "bears a good reputation for honesty and fair dealing";

they recommended that a real estate broker's license be granted

to.. VERHELLE.

An Affidavit in Support of Application for Real

Chairman of the Board of Directors.

The letter further stated

that VERHELLE "alwas conducted himself in an honest and forth-

right manner and he is certainly a man of high moral character

and integrity.

I belive he is well qualified and deserving of

the consideration he is seeking in applying for a broker's

license in Michigan."

LINTEAU never received the requested loan and never was

given a specific reason for the extended delay.

He tried,

unsuecessiully, to get public Bank to return to him the papers

Public Bank concerning the requested loan, LINTEAU was

handicapped in getting other financing.

There also was

This matter. was not resolved to LINTEAU'S

a deposit which had been made or was expected to be made at

Public Bank by the Teansters Pension Fund or by any other

Teamsters organtation.

LINTEAU stated that when he vas an

official of Teamsters Local 614 in Pontiac, he was a "small

cog" in the Teamsters organization and his activity and

influence were primarily limited to the Pontiac area.

He

acquainted with JAMES R, HOFFA, FRANK E

FITZSINNONS and "BERT" BRENNAN, Detroit Teamsters officials,

and he met various officials of the Teamsters at meetings. of

the Central States Teamsters Conference in Chicago, Illinois,

but he did not recall meeting WILLIAM PRESSER or any other

member of the Presser family. LINTEAU stated he never made

a trip to Cleveland or elsewhere in Ohio,

"wouldhit go across the street" as a

favor to JOSEPH VERHELLE.

LINTEAU examined photographs of WILLIAM PRESSER,

LOUIS BABE

recognize them and did not recall their names, except that he

believed PRESSER was a Teamsters official in Ohio.

LINTEAU

did not recognize the names of Niagara Crushed Stone, Alvin

In the latter part of 1961 or the early part of

1962, LINTEAU applied for a $125,000.00 loan from the Teamsters

Central States

Pension Fund In Chicago.

He had not previously

applied for a loan from this source.

He had mentioned his

need for such a loan to Jales k. horrA, who told hinteau to

send the application ior the loan to AL MAtHESoN.

This loan ""

was intended for the purpose of paying off LINTEAU's indebted-

ness to the former owner of All,

financing cars sold through

and building a "Burger Chef:" drive-in restaurant in the

Pontiac, area.

The collateral offered by LINTEAU for this

loan included real estate and commercial interests, which

LINTEAU estmated were worth three or four times the amount

of the requested loan.

This estinate was confirmed by a

representative of the Real Estate Research Corporation of

Chicago, who came to Pontiac to appraise the property for

the Teamsters Pension Fund.

LINTEAU later went to Chicago

and appeared before an eighteen man committee of trustees of

the Pension Fund and this committee acted favorably upon

LINTEAU's loan application.

A MIX. MURTHA, Secretary of the

Pension Fund, told LINTEAU "you ought to get it any day" and

indicated that a letter of commitment would be prepared

immediately. Approximately ten days later, however, LINTEAU

received a letter from STANFORD CLINTON, an attorney for the

Pension Fund, who stated the loan had been rejected as "not

suitable." LINTEAU could not uderstand the reason for rejecting

the loan

after the eighteen man committee had approved it and

he expressed the opinion that FRANK E. FITZSIMMONS "killed"

the loan, LINTEAU did not know why or how FITZSIMMONS could

have done so.

Refering to an extortion case in which LINTEAU

and FITZSINMONS were indicted in 1953 at Detroit and in which

LINTEAU subsequently served a prison sentence, LINIEAU stated

that he had "gone away for FITZ" and, therefore, cannot

understand why FITZSIMIONS would later have prevented LINTEAU

fròm getting a loan, LINTEAU declined to elaborate on the

basis for his statement that he had gone away for "FITZ,"

but stated he had furnished full information concerning that

matter to ROBERT F. KENNEDY several years ago. LINTEAU stated

he had not been in close contact with SAMUEL J. MARROSO SinCE

they both served prison terms in connection with the above-

mentioned case, and LINTEAU did not know of any connection

between MARROSO and any transactions involving Public Bank.

LINTEAU further stated he did not know the basis for any

influence which FITZSIMMONS my have exerted with JOSEPH

VERHELLE, but recalled that VERELLE had indicated FITZSIMMONS

was indebted to Public Bank.

LINTEAU advised that he would review his personal

records and would reflect on the foregoing matters in an

attempt to recall any other names, dates, or other specific

information concerning his contacts with VERHELLE and his

dealings with Public Bank.

LINTEAU was recontacted at his office on October 10,

As previously reported, a $50,000.00 loan was made

to Vendorama of Ohio, Inc., on October

3, 1960, and was renewed

on November 4, 1960, and March 10, 1961.

The notes reportedly

were executed by HERMAN A. PRESSER and JACKIE PRESSER. No

record was located at Public Bank of a loan in the name of

WILLIAM PRESSER. JOSEPH F. VERHELLE, when interviewed on Febru-

ary 13, 1963, stated hedid not know of any loans to WILLIAM

PRESSER from

Public Bank.

VERHELLE said he had had some contact

with WILLIAM PRESSER on other matters, involving the Central

States Pension Fund, but none in connection with the "Niagara-

Naiman" matter.

During the FDIC examination which began December 26,

1961, a listing was made of deposits in Public Bank for the

accounts of various Teamsters organizations. The only deposit

of more than $20,000.00 for the account of the Central States

Pension Fund was

a time certificate of deposit in the amount

of $500,000.00 on February 23, 1961. The only other deposits

over $20,000.00 in accounts of Teamsters organizations in

Public Bank during 1960 and 1961 were as follows:

Also during the above-mentioned FDIC examination it

was reported that there was a balance due Public Bank of

$8,684.15 on a demand note of $10,000.00 dated October 19,

1959, executed by LOUIS and MARCELINE LINTEAU, with the proceeds

having been cudited to the checking account of Auto Europe, Inc.,

at Public Bank.

Collateral for this note was a chattel mortgage

covering a one-fourth interest in a drive-in theater; this security

was assigned by LINTEAU tO KENNETH FRENCH and to the bank as

collateral. Payments on the drive-in theater contract were

expected to reduce the above-mentioned principal balance to

$2,220.81 during the examination. The remaining balance due Public

Bank from Auto Europe, Inc., was shown as $1,552.18, which the

examiners recommended

be charged off as a loss.
