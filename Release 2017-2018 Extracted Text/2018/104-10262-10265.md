SUBJECT 1 Handwriting Identification (22, 028-X) ae
REFERENCE 1 Request Memo, 16 September 1964 :

1, Reference forwarded (1) a poor quality reduced size photo-
graph of a Cuban Visa Application in the name of Lee H. Oewald with
@ handwritten notation in the lower left corner that appears to read
“Hotel del Cameron(?)/Room 18 46-60-51(7)", (2) enlarged photograph,
unknown size, of signature "S, de'Duran", and (3) Xerox copy of Volume
3 of the exhibite in the "Investigation of Assassination cf President John ¥.
Kennedy, November 22, 1963", containing handwriting specimens of Lee
Harvey Oswald. It was requested that an effort be made to determine if
Silvia Duran or Lee H. Oswald wrote the notation in the lower left corner
of the visa application,

2. There are several obstacles, or deficiencies in evidence,
which preclude reaching an un-qualified opinion in thie matter, such ae
the extreme poor quality of the reduced size (eatimated to be about .3X to
§5X) photograph of the visa application as opposed to the enlarged Duran
otgnature, and the absence of comparable letters in the two writings.

3. Neverthel careful examination and comparieon of all of
the writing leads to the following opinion: There {a enough similarity
between the writing in the eignature "'S, de Duran" and the questioned
notation on the visa application to mak ear probable that Duran
Placed the notation on the application, Or, stating it another way: I~
would not eliminate her as a suspect writer of the notation.” Examination
ef the original documents might remove these qualifications,

4. Edo not find enough similarity between Oswald's writing and _ |
the questioned notation to warrant a suspicion that he is the author, ‘
