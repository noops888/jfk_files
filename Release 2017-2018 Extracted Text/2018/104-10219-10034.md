A) Re Watts/Bem telecon, 10 September

8) The meeting took place the morning
of 7 September 1974 in Hiamt. Joe Merola
telephoned Matt HacVane at his home on

7 September 1974 to pass on this informa-
tion. The telecon was unsolicited by
MacVane, who no longer contacts Merola
per DCD Headquarters instructions. Com
Robinson flew in from Nassau to meet with
Joe Merola and Hike Yamanis (Yamanis is
apparently from Ft. Lauderdale and like
Merola he has close ties to arms dealers
and mercenaries). Robinson plans to meet
again with Merola and Yamanis after com-
plete financial details lave been worked
out in Nassau. i
