MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Relatione with Manolo RAY and the MRP

1. For background see my memorandum of 12 May 1961, reporting on

my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto

BETANCOURT. As will be noted in that memorandum, Manolo promised to

come up with a prospectus within approximately ten days' time, after con-

sulting with his leaders in Cuba.

2. On l June 1961 Mr. Barnes called me to say that Mr. Goodwin had

been visited by Mi. Ernesto BETANCOURT who asked for immediate fiñancial

support for certain activities of the MRP which would run around $10, 000 a.

dollars.

Mr. Barnes asked me'to contact BETANCOURT for the purpose of

ascertaining what the funds were to be used for, exactly how much needed, etc..

I called BETANCOURT and he told me that I should get these details from

CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying at.room 549 at the Washington Hotel.

• I called Eugenio and made a date for me and Ray DuBois (Ray Adame le the 2ae

name he uses with Ray and Cieneroa) to call upon him. We called on CISNEROS

at approximately 1845 houra I June, 'and he Informed us that he had urgent

need for pesos for use in support of his sabotage and underground activities..

in Cuba. He said his people were absolutely without lunds, needed money for

living expenses, transportation, purchase of sabotage equipment, air fares for

couriers, and for assisting people to get out of prison. He said that it was

now possible for people to buy thelf way out of prison by bribing one of the

many "communiet" lawyers and judges. He thought that 40, 000 or 50, 000 pesos?

would meet iminedlate needs and that come sort of arrangement should be made

to receive funds - 30. 000 monthly or thereaboute - on a fixed and permanent 5.

pesos

3.

We made no commitment to Eugenio other than to say that we would

pass his plea along to the interested people. if reminded him that we had asked

him and Manolo to prepare i plan for consideration and that we were thirs

waiting for that plan. I said I personally doubted that anything could be done

until the plan was received from RAY. He said Manolo was planning to come to

Washington on the afternoon of 2 June with the plan, but that he himself was

having to return to Miami immediately and it was vital he be able to take the

money with him, arrange in Miami for purchase of the pesos (at rate of 4'x1 -

monty already in Cuba - dollars would be delivered an amera of the pesos who

are in Miami). I told him I would cali kim in the mining to ict him koow how

things stood.

1. I discussed our meeting with CISNEROS with Fracy Barnes on the

morning of 2 June. It was Tracy'e opinion, in which I heartily concur, that

we should put out no money whatsoever until we have had a chance so esamine

Manolo's plan did to study just what repercussions a ramifications there

would be, policy-wise and otherwise, to a decision to asairt the MRP

unilaterally; that is,

outside the Council ad presemaily without MIRO's

knowledge or consent.

Since RAY has withdrawn his praup from the Council

with a great deal of fanfare, it is most unlikely that like wouid look kindly

on any assistasce to RAY, especially since he feels he has a rather firma

promise from the President to deal only through MIRD.

5. RAY, upon arrival in Washington, will presumably take his plan (along

with BETANCOURT) directly to Mr. Goodwin and I would aiso presume that

Goodwin will pass it down to Tracy and Tracy to us. Hay DuBois. ho has

been Manolo's case oifices, is standing by in the even he siould be needed..:

6. I personally feel very strongly that we should de nuthimy to support the

plan, whatever is is, until we have received from the Mi Herise and the

Department clear-cut, unequivocal policy goidance on the everall plan. I also -

on this job. Harry is tempermentally suited, has a gund buriness head. la.

fuent in Spanish (lived 28 years in Cuba), is cleared, ilous directions,

completely honest and tremendously conscientious. E waitibe harder lo

find a better person.

7. Also, I would like to point out the security risha inheren in say arrange-

ments with the RAY-BETANCOURT-CISNEROS trio. Wrese fellars have had

easy access 8o the White House and to the Department, are notarious for their

"planned leaks", will probably presume all the Department officials they deal

with are privy to the arrangement, and before we know it the wiible exile

community will be well aware that we are providing financiall and renterial

support to the RAY group. I am not arguing against prawidling such tpport.

but am merely pointing out the real porearial for embarrassrent to us if the

matter is nos hardled with the greatest of precautions. I feelthey have become

100 closely identified with U.S.-officialdom. including myself, and that the

plausible denial aspects, to dale at least, are almost mun-emintent.
