MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD :

SUBJECT: Relations with Manolo RAY and the MRP
——

1, For background see my memorandum of 12 May 1961, reporting on
my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto
BETANCOURT. As will be noted in that memorandum, Manolo promised to
come up with a prospectus within approximately ten days' time, after con-
sulting with his leaders in Cuba,

: 2, On1 June 1961 Mr, Barnes called me to say that Mr. Goodwin had

: been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT who asked for immediate finan: jal.

5 support for certain activities ofthe MRP which would run around $10, 00

; dollars. Mr. Barnes asked me'to contact BETANCOURT for the purpose’ o!

: ascertaining what the funds weré to be used for, exactly how much neede
I called BETANCOURT and he told mé'that I should get these details fro
CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying’at-room 549 at the Washington Hotel

-. .* Lealled Eugenio and made a date for ie and Ray DuBois (Ray Adame is th
name he uses with Ray and Cisneros) to‘call upon him, We called on CISNEROS:
at approximately 1845 hours 1 Jure} “and he informed us that he had urgent
need for pesos for use in support of hie sabotage and underground activitie
in Cuba, He said his people were absolutely without funds, needed mor

him and Manolo to prepare aplan'for cons{dé¥ation and that we wer:
waiting for that plan, I said I personally doubted that anything could be done
until the plan was received from RAY. He said Manolo was planning to come to
Washington on the afternoon of 2 June with the-plan, but that he himself waa

money already in Cuba - dollars would be delivered ar cuzers af the pesos who
are in Miami). I told him I would cali him in the mooning: to: Het him know how
things stood. F :

4, discussed our meeting with CISNEROS with Tracy Barnes on the
morning of 2 June, It was Tracy's opinion, in which D heartily concur, that
we should put out no money whatsoever until we have Rad 2 chamce to examine

Manolo's plan and to stuty jo Wat Fepercussions om ramifications there
would be, policy-wise and otherwise, to a decision tw aseist the MRP
unilaterally; that is, outside the Council ard presctmehly withaut MIRO’
knowledge or consent. Since RAY has withdrawn his group fram the Council
with a great deal of fanfare, ‘it is most unlikely that MAG would look kindly
on any assistance to RAY, “especially since he feels bh: iawa rather firm _
promise from the President to deal only through MIR:

5. RAY, upon arrival in Washington, will presanaliy take his plan (along
with BETANCOURT) directly to Mr. Goodwin and ] wuuld aieo presume that
Goodwin will pass it down.to Tracy and Tracy tous. Bay A Cae :
been Manolo's case olficer,-i standing by in the event Re siinuld be needed... ::) .

6. Tpersonally feel very strongly that we should do amthing to support the
plan, whatever it is, until we have received from the, Mite House and the
Department clear-cut, unequivocal policy gcidance ox the cxerall plan, I also”
feel that now is the time, if we are go ing to support tie BEXP unilaterally, to
insert a non-official cut out into the operation, I wout!! Yecummend that con-
sideration be given to using[Mr. Harry Pieper Ja WAVE eautract employee)
on this job. Harry is tempermentally suited, has a gund Business head, i
fluent in Spanish (lived 28 years in Cuba), is cleared, fplfinns directions,
completely honest and tremendously conscientious, Bt woniifibe harder to
find a better person, .

2% Also, Iwould like to point Sut the security risks Hnberias is‘aiy. ari ge-
ments with the RAY-BETANCOURT-CISNEROS trio. Uhese fellows have had = -
easy access to the White House and to the Department, are antoious for their —
"planned leaks", will probably presume all the Departuent afficials they deal
with are privy to the arrangement, and before we know it tie 3
community will be well aware that we are providing fimmeied andl material
support to the RAY group. 1am not arguing against praviing euch Scpport,
but am merely pointing out the real potential for embarcasurent tous if the
matter is not handled with the greatest of precautions. F firef they have become
too closely identified with U, S, -officialdom, including myself, amd thatthe =~
plausible denial aspects, to date at least, are almost mn-existemt.
