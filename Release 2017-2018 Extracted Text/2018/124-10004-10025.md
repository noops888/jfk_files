who acquired this intelligence informa fion, I feel a conten
responsibility for seeing it through (0 its final evaluation."

It appears, therefore, that Mr. THOMAS has now decided that he

and not the FBI or the Department of Justice is the one to

decide how the story given’ by Miss GARRO is to be evaluated.

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-
ment agency information relating to matters within the jurisdiction
of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and eagiesta action taken by that agency is, of course,
untenable. CN

Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS’ judgment is
raisedgby item 3 of paragraph 10 of his memorandum furnished to
the Secretary of State. Any reference to the!
relationship between the head of CIA Mexico an ‘Op Mexican
officials,if true, is a very highly classified matter and any
"leak" or revelation to unauthorized individuals concerning such
an arrangement would, in view of the delicate Mexican political
situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as
to Mexican-American relations. The delicacy of the situation
has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban
allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in
I Havana was acting as a CIA spy with the knowledge of the Mexican
Government.| Mr. THOMAS, however, included such a highly
classifie eference in a memorandum which he classified only
as “confidential”, contrary to regulations relative to classification
of documents. While this reference relates to the activities and
eperations of another Government agency and therefore is not of
primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the
Bureau's attention «Begoneserasion in evaluating Mr. THOMAS'

current allegations.

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded
for use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to
Dallas which received a copy of referenced letter. Fe)
