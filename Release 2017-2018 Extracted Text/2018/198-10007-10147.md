CUBA
THE MOVEMENT OF SUBVERSIVES AND SUBVERSIVE TRAINEES

I. Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede
the flow of subversives between Cuba and other Latin
American countries. Execution of any one or more of
the enumerated actions will ameliorate the situation;
execution of them all will not completely solve it,
The practical problems involved are too numerous and
complex.

With respect to diminishing legal travel to Cuba,
we face multiple problems in the policies and attitudes
of those Latin American countries through which the
subversive traveller must pass. From the viewpoint of
these nations the direct actions required have strong
political and sometimes legal implications - impli-
cations which cannot be overcome easily, even when
the leaders of these countries choose to do so.

In the matter of clandestine travel, we are
confronted not only with the great depth of communist
guile, born of two generations of experience in the
international movement of subversives, but with the
inexperience, ineptitude and lack of awareness in
these same matters on the part of the Latin American
community.

In spite of this, the advantages do not all reside
with the communists. Cuba's insular character imposes
certain sharp limitations upon personal movement.

Cuba has no frontiers with other states; everyone
who enters the country must do so either by water,
or air, There can be no slipping through the
barbed wire,

SECRET

SECRET

On the other hand, this same geographic situation
makes clandestine entry and exit reasonably simple.
There are 3,825 linear miles of essentially unpa-
trolled Central American coastline, within 175 to
850 miles from Cuba. There are at least 93 airfields,
other than ours, within 700 miles of the island, and
the ships and craft indigenous to the Caribbean, and
capable of supporting the subversive ebb and flow,
number well into the thousands.

Even in the face of these unfavorable factors, a
program of direct restraints, selected from among
the actions enumerated herein, can have favorable
effects, Under the proposed steps some travel would
be stopped completely. More - probably much more -
would be rendered difficult, Some hitherto legal
movement would be driven underground. ° Previous
clandestine movement would be impeded, complicated
and harassed to the point where it becomes more
costly, more uncertain, more hazardous and thus,
hopefully, less extensive.

II, Nature and Scope of the Problem

We do not know enough about the movement of
subversive trainees, into Cuba and - more important -
out of Cuba, We do not know enough about the volume
of travel, or the media employed. This is par-
ticularly true in the area of illicit traffic, where
our knowledge is extremely limited,

Regarding legal travel to Cuba, CIA presents the
following estimate:

* In transit, including about 300 Mexicans

While some of these travellers proceeded to Cuba by
other routes, the great majority passed through Mexico,
On the most conservative basis, then, it will be seen
that there cannot have been fewer than 4,912 travellers
to Cuba during 1962, while the average monthly number
passing through Mexico for the first two months of
1963 is even higher than the 1962 monthly average,

Of the total number visiting Cuba, the Central
Intelligence Agency estimates that at least 1,500, and

perhaps as many as 2,000,have received ideological
indoctrination or guerrilla warfare training. Many

of these are still in Cuba, Others have returned to
their homelands; some by legal means; some probably
by illicit means, There is no reason to presume,
moreover, that the travel to Cuba of the remaining
3,000-3,500 was entirely consistent with the best
interests of the hemisphere,

Prior to the October crisis, Latin Americans
travelling to Cuba usually moved by regular commercial
airlines or, on occasion, by specially chartered
Cubana flights. Some travelled to Trinidad or
Curacao and thence by regularly scheduled Cubana ‘or
KIM flights to Havana. Others travelled to Mexico,
and from there by Mexicana or Cubana commercial
flights to Havana, With the cessation of service
to Cuba by Pan American, KIM, Mexicana, and Iberia
airlines in October, the regular Cubana service
between Mexico City and Havana remained the sole
direct and regular airline connection between Cuba
and the remainder of Latin America,

The Cubana service between Havana and Mexico is
scheduled to operate twice weekly, but sometimes only.
a single flight is completed per week. Aircraft now
employed are British Britannias - an obsolescent model.
Cubana has requested, but has not yet received,

Mexican approval to substitute Soviet IL-18 transports
‘for the old Britannias, Delay by the Mexicans in
granting this approval can have the favorable effect
of impeding travel, as the Britannias are now in

poor condition, If, in addition, the British and
Canadians can be induced to suspend delivery of

spare parts, the planes will soon become inoperatives

Iberia airlines resumed its regular twice-monthly
flights from Madrid to Havana on 11 February. This
flight makes one stop, in the Azores. before reaching
Havana.

KIM has not yet resumed its regular flights to Cuba
from the Netherlands Antilles, However, it is now con+
sidering doing so. In this regard it 1s concluded that
resumption of scheduled flights by a United States
earrier could serve as an encouragement to KIM and
others to do the same.

Soviet and Czech airlines serving Cuba do not stop
regularly at any other Latin American country, ‘though
the Soviet Aeroflot line has occasionally sought and
received permission from Brazil to land-at Recife,
enroute to Cuba. Some Latin Americans may have
travelled to Cuba on these infrequent flights and,
should Brazil permit this arrangement to become
regularized, the movement of subversives could
achieve a new order of magnitude.

A Canadian non-scheduled line has operated.a few
flights from Canada to Havana and return, carrying
both material and personnel. The Canadians have been
unresponsive to our efforts to obtain identification
of the passengers.

There are no regularly scheduled sea carriers
operating between Latin America and Cuba. However,
a number of trainees from British Guiana have
travelled to Cuba aboard unscheduled Cuban merchant
vessels engaged in transporting rice from Guiana to
Cuba.

Clandestine sources report that transit of Latin
Americans through Mexico to Cuba often involves illicit
procedures, The Cuban embassy in Mexico City provides
the travellers, whom they identify as tourists, with
special Cuban entry papers; no entry is made in their
passports, and they are given pseudonyms for travel
out of and into Mexico. This procedure .is obviously
designed to impede any effort by the other Latin
American governments subsequently to identify the
travellers and to exercise surveillance over their
activities upon their returns

Evidence at hand portrays a substantial flow of
travel by légal means. This must be countered
directly. Beyond this, and perhaps.of greater
importance, is the problem of illicit movement both
into and out of Cuba, which will undoubtedly assume
growing proportions as legal travel is curtailed,
and about which our intelligence is at present most
limited, Elimination of this intelligence void must
be accorded ‘high priority.

TII. The Attitudes of the Latin American Nations

Success of many of the overt actions proposed in
the sections to follow will turn upon the attitudes
of the Latin American nations within whose borders
the restraining actions must take place, Presented
briefly below is an estimate of what can be expected
from the various sectors of Latin America in terms
of participation in a coordinated program of travel
control.

As a general matter, the imposition of controls
on travel is not popular with the public in any Latin
American country. This, coupled with their current
lack of full awareness of the danger represented by
Cuba's training of subversives, will diminish the
willingness of some governments to impose controls.
unilaterally. This is especially true since they
recognize that unilateral restraints will have little
effect on curbing the travel of their nationals to
Cuba, if supporting multilateral action is not also
taken. It is likely, however, that most of the
Latin American countries would respond favorably --
albeit in varying degrees -~ to US leadership in
seeking to reduce the flow of persons to: Cuba for
ideological or subversive training.

The Central American countries are more acutely
aware of the danger posed by Cuban-inspired sub-
version than is Latin America at large, and can be
expected to react favorably to proposals for re-
ducing travel to Cuba which President Kennedy might
present at the San Jose Presidential meeting.
However, their ability to carry out commitments which
they may make will be limited by domestic legal
and political considerations, as well as by their
countries!’ technical incompetence in such matters.

Since Mexico is currently the principal
hemisphere transit point for legal travel of sub-
versives to and from Cuba, its attitude is of great
importance, Mexico, to date, has taken several
significant steps with respect to travel between
Mexican cities and Cuba, It has instituted close

surveillance over travellers, to include stamping
passports to evidence travel to Cuba. In addition,
the Mexicans now photograph, covertly, all persons
arriving from or departing for. Cuba, and have given
tacit approval to suspension of Cuban service by
Compania Mexicana de Aviacion (CMA), These actions.
all suggest that Mexico might be induced to take even
further cooperative steps, particularly on an un-
publicized, bi-lateral basis, wherein the political
hazards of taking a public OAS position are not
involved. In this regard, the Central American
Presidents would probably agree individually to seek
the participation of President Lopez Mateos of Mexico
in specific cooperative moves to restrict the flow

of persons to Cuba through that country.

Peru now has regulations which actually prohibit
travel to Cuba, but the regulations have engendered
public resistance, and are not enforced, The
Dominican Republic prohibits such travel... Haiti
has no established policy, but passports and exit
permits are reportedly issued only on the personal
approval of President Duvalier, Colombia could
legally impose restrictions by executive decree,
but has shown no inclination to do so, Other
countries, such as Venezuela, Chile, and the Central
American nations, plead the existence of legal or
constitutional barriers which preclude the pro-
hibition of travel to Cuba, but thus far, they
have made little effort to remove these barriers.

Five Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile,
Uruguay, Mexico, and Bolivia). now maintain diplomatic
relations with Cuba. Brazil continues its drift to
theleft and gives little evidence of modifying its
tolerant attitude toward the Castro government.
Chile, with a legal Communist Party, exercises no
restraints on travel to Cuba, either direct or
via third country.

The elimination of all legitimate passenger
service to Cuba from Latin America could be

achieved through invocation of the Rio Treaty, but it
is unlikely that the hemisphere countries would agree
to do so in the absence of some major crisis similar
to that involving the Soviet missiles or a case of
direct Cuban intervention in another Latin American
country. Nevertheless, a campaign on our part. to
develop a full awareness of the danger represented

by the flow of Castro-trained subversives would
probably create a growing willingness to take action
oriented in this direction. In this connection,
however, it is concluded that resumption of regular
passenger service to Cuba by United States companies
would render more difficult our efforts to persuade
Latin American and other free world countries. to

take a grave view of the situation, and to partici-
pate in dynamic action.

Virtually, all the Latin American countries. would
be willing to move against Cuban-trained subversives
upon their return to home countries, once they put
their new training to use. The efforts of these
nations will not be dramatically effective, however,
since, in the area of internal security, all of them
suffer from deficiencies in technical .skill, training,
equipment and sometimes from a lack of a sense of
urgency. The United States can provide essential
leadership in eliminating all of these deficiencies.

Iv. Actions Concerning Legitimate Travel

Listed below are specific actions contemplated to
impede legitimately executed travel, to and from Cuba.
Legitimate travel is characterized, for this purpose,
as travel on recognized public carriers, openly
arranged and involving travel documents which are
presumed to be in proper order, Certain of the
actions, it will be noted, are partially in effect.
Others have been proposed to the OAS - wholly or in
part - by its Special Consultative Committee on
Security.

V. Actions Concerning Illegal Travel

As the actions outlined in the preceding sections
become effective, one of the results will be to force
the hitherto legal travel into clandestine channels.
It may, therefore, be expected that measures to
impede illegal movement will acquire steadily in-
ereasing importance.

The steps proposed herein are listed, as in the
preceding section, in terms of immediate impact .pro-
jects which promise early and visible results, and
longer range projects which, while of great importance,
eannot be expected to mature as rapidly.
