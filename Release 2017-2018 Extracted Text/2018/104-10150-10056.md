time ago it arrived this morning. We requested that

this review (the earlier draft having boen reviewed

already).

The notations in the margins are for this

purpose.

It is requested that this be given priority attention.

Rein (the HSCA staffer handling this) had wanted our

comments back by today, which the timing of receid ha:
