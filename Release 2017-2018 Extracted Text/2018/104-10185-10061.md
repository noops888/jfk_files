commented as follows:

a) Accordaig to Identity, the three Individuals mentioned

In the respective reporis are the persons best sulted from

it point of View of ability, reservedness and experience for

utilization in sensitive operations. He added that he could

have provided us with the names of more individuals all of

whom, however, would huve presented certain pecullar

problems prejudicial to the successful outcome of this type

of operation. On this score, being an old police officer,

Identity immedlately realized that an illegal entry operation

must be in the wind, but did not ask for any details.

b) In passing the requested information, identity advised

that he remuins at our disposal for any further detalls

which might be needed. I necessary he is personally

= Willing to perform introductions.

c) As is evident, the name of Gua VOGRIC (mentioned

by CLARKSON as a possibility based on a casual DEBACON

reference) did not come up. We, therefore, abstained from

making any reference to this person.

3. Il may be advisable to make additional checks regarding the personalitles

and political leanings of these persons, especially Bernardini.

4 CLARKSON nowremembers the name of the individual discussed with

RABNEY, SHERIDAN and MAGONETTI to be CUCCAGNA instead of VOGRIC. However,

it may be also advisable for WAGONETTI to obtain a background report on Gus Vogric.

5. DEPIGRAVEwas queried about these individuals and contributed

ructicaly the same information is MAGONETTI with the exception that Bernardin

§'interested in emigrating to Switzerland, that Subati's italianized name is Sabazzi

Further, that Sabazzi is the proprietor of a Flat model 1100 which he uses to make

trips to j'ugoslavia from Trieste, allegedly for the mushroom trade; also that Sabazzi

is in possession of in Italian passport valid for foreign travel.
