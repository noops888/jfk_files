a) Accorduig.to Identity, the three individuals mentioned
In the respective reports are the persons best sulted from
4 point of view of ability, reservedness and experience for
utilization in sensitive operations, He added that he could
have provided us with the names of more individuals all of
whom, however, would have presented certain pecullar
problems prejudicial to the successful outcome of this type
of operation. On this score, being an old police officer,
Identity immediately realized that an illegal entry operation
must be in the wind, but did not ask for any details, :

b) In passing the requested information, identity advised
that he remains at our disposal for any further details
which mightbe needed, If necessary he is personally

~~ willing to perform introductions,

©) As Is evident, the name of Gua VOGRIC (mentioned

by CLARKSON as a possibility based on a casual DEBACON
reference) did not come up, We, therefore, abstained from
making any reference to this person,

3, It may be advisable to make additions] checks regarding the personalities
and political leanings of these persons, especially Bernardini,

: 4, CLARKSON nowremembers the name of the individual discussed with
RABNEY, SHERIDAN and MAGONETTI to be CUCCAGNA instead of VOGRIC, However,
ft may be also advisable for MAGONETTI to obtain a background report on Gus Vogric,

5. DEPIGRAai}was queried about these individuals and contributed
practically the Same inforfiiation as MAGONETTI with the exception that Bernardini
is interested in emigrating to Switzerland, that Subutii’s italianized name is Sabazzi,
Further, that Sabazzi is the proprictor of a Fiat model 1100 which he uses to make
trips to Yugoslavia from Trieste, allegedly for the mushroom trade; also that Sabazzi
