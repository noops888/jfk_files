MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD fi

SUBJECT : Contact Report, 8 May 1967

PARTICIPANTS: Edward G. TICHBORN,

PLACE ot Hotel, 1230-1500 Hours .

1 Preliminary meeting was in the hotel room but the bulk of the dis-,
cussion took place during lunch and afterwards. The gist of the discussion .
with TICHBORN was as follows: : a

i
h

a. TICHBORN explained how he had been surprised at the sudden’
loss of interest by Antonio Menendez in the project and particularly in,,
introducing TICHBORN to other contacts. TICHBORN says that the | +
reason for this is Menendez" sudden recognition of the danger to his |
political future in even indirectly being connected with what could become
a controversial book. TICHBORN attempted to develop various hypotheses
for the revelation of this fear at this time rather than earlier inthe |,
negotiations. There was, however, no really clear explanation of why |
Menendez had so suddenly drawn into his shell.

b. TICHBORN was asked whether he felt,that in some ways we ih
were not "taken"' by Menendez. He responded wiih considerable heat by
Saying that it was a calculated gamble that "just didn't pay off". He |,
became very defensive when the discussion turned to the original evaluation
of Antonio Menendez. He says that he is convinced that Menendez has’ ''
the information as well as the cortacts and in short was the right man but
one who turned out to be unwilling to run the risks involved for the "small
amount of money" he would be paid. TICHBORN attempted to make a |,
strong case for his belief that Menendez was the right man and emphasized.
(somewhat apart from the point) that some day he will have an important’
post in a future PRI government. TICHBORN says the whole problem i
was discussed with lwho agreed that the project could not be!’

productive now due to the sudden reluctance of Antonio Menendez. did
‘lose Luis Siqueiros to introduce TICHBORN to their contacts.
also felt, according to TICHBORN, that it would be risky for
TICHBORN to contact Gonzalez Casanova, Cholula and Urquidi. white! !
details of the discussions between and TICHBORN were not)’ i
given, it seems that the decision not to proceed was reached without any
major hassle between TICHBORN and(________]_ (Comment: TICHBORN
appears to be not at all unhappy about terminating what could have i, et " i
become a long and unproductive research effort built on a shaky story of
of TICHBORN writing a book on the PRI.) ‘ i i. 7

c. ‘Antonio Menendez wrote up in Inglish some of his comments. 1

based on his approach to the research problem. This 13 page double

* spaced report is attached. . z “ “ uy

: d. Chaconas asked TICHBORN how well he knew Carlos Fuentes
(for possible BGBERET targeting). TICHBORN replied that he knew .
him very well and that he feli he could approach him directly if he-had a ee f
reason for being in Paris (vacation, for example) or wherever Fuentes
is now living. TICHBORN said that he believed Fuentes would acc an fice |
assignment to write articles on North Vietnam based on a future visit 4
to that area but he also indicated that he believed we could not control : a
the tone. of the articles which would be likely to be pro-North rine a

2, TICHBORN was asked fo review the list of trips ‘TICHBORN
had made outside the country and fo confirm the dates and advances involved.

asked TICHBORN to get a list from his cover company of his domestic

. accounting for the latest trip to Mexico City in as soon as possible. TICHBORN

trips so that when the cover company submits a claim, WH will have a record
of what trips were authorized for operational purposes involving TICHBORN.
TICHBORN, .on the same subject, said that he feels as does his cover company
boss that some other arrangement should be made for some of his travel for
WH. TICHBORN says he feels that the amount, of travel he is involved i inimay
appear unusual to the cover company accountant. greed that this was
not a good situation over the long run and that he would talk to
bette making-different arrangements for the future, :

3. TICHBORN was requested to rebate the sim. 18 owed from the advance
given him in Mexico for his trip there on 17 March. He offered to write out
a check but suggested that he send the check throughthe proper channels

to the post office box number given him. He also promised to send'the |:

1. the undersigned Lunched on 15 Decenber 1956 with!

the Wa/6 Case Officer for Edvard G. TICHBORN (P under WUSALIRE
formerly nov Deputy")
Chief, WH/6 under] He 10 @ very coupotent and conscientious

case officer. He believes that WH Divioion should get the most operaticnal
benefits possible froa Tichborn, inasmuch as WH Division is paying Tich-
vora's salary. He ic working diligently to acxs up with operational | | q
essignsenta for Tichbormm. He has Tichborn working on tv> research A
projects and hopes to cutablish Tichborn as a political advisor to

. the Government of the Doniniean Republic. Although WH Diviefon is {ti |
suffering bufiget cuts, which Mr. Potten Jemonta, bis project for il
Tichborn has been approved for one year ani funds are evailable.

i 2. In view of Jeonseientious: appronch an case a
officer for Tishborn ani cone mown parochialisnm in WH, the at
wilersigned felt tt umrics to pros oan more than a
epproval for Tichborn to make a 2-3 trip to Spain. In
fect, the undersigned had to present o considerable case for i
: even this limi born. However, ag a result, it zg
é is believed that support in WH Division a TDY vy
in Spain tor TMehborn cf 2-3 weeks duration et DO
will esil the undersigned on 19 Decenber, to report ft
‘the WE position. i i
3. The undersigned seized upon the buiget eut point to volunteer) |: |
that DO would be amenable to helping out with Tichborn's salary if
WH 19 herd pressed. Jacclined, inaomch as hia project ;
4s eyproved for one your. 1% to get so many operational call
from Tichborn that he will heve no problem reneving the project next 1
year. He did admit that DO's willingness to pay Tichborn's expenses |.

h, The undersigned pointed out that he haf not yet approached i‘: |”
the Spanish Desk on a TDY for Tichborn, because it vas desired to. iy

=.



get WH Division's views ao a first step. eaid ‘hat in
the event, cf WH approval of a TDf to Spain for Tichborn that
he vould 1fk to participate with DO anf the Spanish Desk in
of Zichborn. The undersigned reaiily concurred.
thinks that Tichborn should not be a global asset
‘but rather one limited to Latin Accrica. However, he did
concur with the undercigned that Spain represents an exception
becausa of language und historical ties to Latin America.
Jjatrongly hopes Tichborn.cen be a political edvisor
. to the Daninican Republic Coverment. He would not think of
reccemevling to his superiors more than a 2-3 weeks TDY for
fichborn with the understanding that the advisor roq:irenent
has priority. The undersigned pointed out that DDP considers
tha Spanish requirement high priority, and that uso of Tichborn
for o TOY to Spain vould surely be on important Justification
when project renewal time comes around.

5. It 18 hoped that Wi'a position will be favorable for a
2-3 waoks use of Tichboru in Spain. Any presoing of WH for uss
of Tishborn corer @ longer period i3 a matter of delicacy. The
unieroigned Imova that UH feels they were coerced into accepting
Project VUEHTEEE. The uvlersigned would not reccemend pressure.
On the contrary, the undursignod has hoped to use Tichbora as a
wesns of opening up Latin America for Project VUBRINY.

MEMO : To

PRCA :

IN RE: Projected trip through Latin America

Bearing in mind that our. executive committee may (at

some future but presently undetermined date) desire

to undertake in-depth surveys of economic conditions, 1

ith
certain Latin American countries, we consider it highly de-

sirable to establish prior contacts witn the banking’ oat
business communities of several ‘selected areas watch: dre

most likely to offer jsound investment opportunities:

Our past experience indicates that it 1s much etn

assess spontaneous financial ventures if one is already

acquainted with the business ambiance of a particularilcountry.

Thus, having previously touched base with local bankéts and

industrialists, Jrould have the advantage of tater

personal advice in matters relating to any specific
sequent projects.

Tne countries that would seen to offer the most)

Faas i
ising opportunities for are PERU, CHILE, ARGENTINY

URUGUAY, BRAZIL and VENEZUELA. Fortunately, we nave idireaty

established certain minimal ties with most of these countries,

but’ it would be best for| himself to become personally

“4

trip. Taking into account the ‘normal travel delays; ‘ene

trip would require about eighteen (18) days. it
Budget requirements: : ta

This is Pan American Airlines special ‘slanter
fare." Normally, the trip costs $640 Per person.

. 2) Lodging, food and minimal entertainment| !
expenses - about $35 daily per person. ||
Total for each person would be about $630.

3) Miscellaneous expenses (cab fares to an

H relations with| The following points of interest were gleaned in |;
i this period, :

" ith
a. is a highly-trained promoter who-is coldly reserved! :|
and capable, Ie seems to be generally pleased with TICHBORN and) i

his capabilities for serving the firm as legal advisor, contact man, | H F
and unofficial economic consultant on economic matters. i E

! if let alone, would use 100% of TICHBORN's time. |! ° aia
When he brought this up, used it as a starting place for briefing [eeeea
on the general nature of TICHBORN's functions of the past. ea
i was told that he would need TICHBORN for "research activities" , it i
in addition to any use involving special trips to Latin America. He |
was told we would need 50% or more of TICHBORN's time to carry ||
out these activities. It was pointed out to/him that because of the | i
nature of TICHBORN's services, we would have to insist that he be ||.
available for immediate use and hence could not be on any long-range .
projects which would be difficult to drop. accepted H
these limitations without visable annoyances or objections.

da. Tichborn says his office cover is good and there are no
indications that he is not accepted for what he purports to be.

wd



-2-

EEHBORE concurs in this estimate of the lack of security proble:
within the office.

2. After leaving we went to dinner where the following
subjects were discussed:

a pointed cut clearly that he was "the bogs" and responsttle
for TICHBORN's operational utilization. TICHBORN was told that | a
is responsible for the commercial setup. There appeared: to
no doubt in his mind as to who calls the shots, , tk n
on
b. TICHBORN was told of our need for an experienced Latin | t
American specialist who could handle political action research on key i
issues in certain countries, He was also told of our interest in possible
CA covert action advisory tasks, Our need for someone able to make!
meaningful interpretive analyses was explaisied in some detail and. ; 1
examples of probable areas and issues were presented. TICHBORN’ |
} said he had no special experience in content analysis or survey analysis '
techniques, However, he was apparently very much interested in the |, il
idea, He said that he would get the book suggested on content analysis:
He will check into the availability of the Dominican Republic papers |
mentioned and let [__lknow by 5 November if they can be had in New a
York City. He was requested to approach the problem along the ge: ral:
following lines: Analyze the Bosch anti-government statements for *':
indications of whom he Is trying to reach, how, and for what reason ‘t
(since June 15). Similarly analyze the Balaguer statements rane pd

spite takistace.

1) Influences the news media is having on his public image.

2) Where and how could he strengthen this image.
3) What issues should be raised or surpressed.

It was suggested that the try to get issues of El Caribe and Listin Diartst H

Enitial impressions of TICHBORN were as follows: He is very
Wyle and in addition is "sharp". He has a professionally smooth and | :'
friendly manner, He is a natural politican. He is an “operator" and will
collaborate very closely and enthusiastically so long as there is real benefit’ |
in itfor him. He is probably sensitive to his Mexicau-American ancestory aa!
indicated by his obvious annoyances (albeit presented jokingly) at the fact that: i}



rs

3 ‘

-3-

he has not been invited out to lunch by any members off company’
in the six weeks he has worked there. He is probabiy not a detailed mat

and is impressed by social position and wealth and consequently likes to)!
function on a high level. Although there is no real reason to believe that
TICHBORN may see another career ahead, feels there is a possibi
that| will try to hire him for his company.or he may make contacts
in New York City which could lead to his getting a non-ClA job.

| He has requested reassignuent
to the United States, preiorably the Hast Coast and particularly
the New York City area. WH Division has concurred in hig
request to leave Hexico City in mid-August 1966 and desires

to arrange suitable cover which would permit rapid disengagenent:

of assigning Tichborn to sisatrNE, —

3. On the basis of information nade available
WH Divieion believes the WUSALINE proposal has merit and wishes
to develop this cover proposal further, It would appear that a u
satisfactory resolution at this tine ultimately rests upon WH i
Division agreement with Tichtorn on teras of his contract, qe
primarily salary, and WUSALINE agreement that Tichborn's back-
ground is of sufficient depth to provide a modicwa of credibility
and his personality is of such a nature that he would be coapat-
ible with the principal agent. This will be resolved after
Labor Day when Tichborn will be in the United States and the
WUSALINE principal agent will have returned from a vacation
which he is starting about 1 August. In the meantinge, in con-
Pliance witb regulations for the establishment’ of non-official
cover, the fellowing background information is provided concerning
Tichborn and is keyed to your memorandum, “Non-Official Cover

B.

BMMW 14392, 10 March 1966

1. Project LICOLIC has been renewed for Piscal Year 1966 in
the amount of $19,000 as requested. This approval was effective
2 March 1966,

2. As you are aware there has been a good deal of discussion
here concerning TICHBORN's operational activities and how he might
best contribute to the overall objectives of the Station. It was
agreed during visit here (See Ref B) that TICHBORN
would be considered henceforth as a full time Station asset and
attention would be given to gaining maximum value from his continued
presence in Mexico, Within this context, however, it should also
be noted that this Project was renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 with
the condition that ". . . prior to the end of.the current fiscal
year (1966), adequate cover is found to afford TICHBORN rot only
the needed mobility and safeguards for his work in behalf of the
tation, but also for his possible third country political
action assignments. . .". In addition, the following recommendation
was made in the event Project LIREAM should not be renewed ( which
should not really be considered at present since agreement was

reached to approve Project LIREAM also), ". . . If this turns out
to be the case we would‘ recommend that TICHBORN be reassigned to
another area (suggest ZRKETAL) under the. type of cover (e.g. JETUBA)
which would offer him the needed mobility and protection for area=
wide political action assignments .. .". Needless to say, although
the latter point should be kept in mind as a last alternative in
any decision regarding TICHBORN's continued relationship with this
Agency, the Branch believes that the LIREAN publication has im-
proved and has a good chance to gain acceptance and expand its
influence throughout the hemisphere. This being the case, and

as Station plans for expanding TICHBORN's activity within Mexico
take form, we hope his contribution to KUBARK objectives in Mexico
and throughout Latin America will become more substantial and .
recognized.

3. Aga matter of information, Headquarters would appreciate
‘ICHBORN preparing a summary of his present cover situation, par=
ticularly his appreciation of his present residence and work
status in Mexico, and his estiuate of what the future holds for
him in this regard. Further, we would appreciate any indication
the Station may have concerning TICHEORN's personal plans in regard
to his continued residence in Mexico and his future rei.itionship
with KUBARK.
