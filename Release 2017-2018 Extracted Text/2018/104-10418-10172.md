January 8, 1979

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS
U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

This responds in full to a December 18,
1978, letter to the Attorney General signed by G. Robert
Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, which asked
that the FBI declassify, in toto, a Secret, September 14,
1978, response made to 16 interrogatories pertaining to
Yuri Ivanovich Nosenko which were propounded by the
Committee in its letter of September 5, 1978.

Declassification of the September 14, 1978,
response required coordination with the Office of Legis-
lative Counsel, CIA, which interposed no objection to
declassifying certain portions of that response.

The Committee's attention is invited to the
fact that CIA did suggest, with regard to the response
to interrogatory number "8", that the FBI"... may wish
to. correct the dates on which the FBI did not have direct
access to Mr. Nosenko, to read 3 April 1964 until 8 December
1968."

For the convenience of the Committee, the
following declassified, verbatim reiteration of the
September 14, 1978, response is. provided.

This responds in full to the followi
interrogatories submitted for. consideration ina letter,
dated Scptember 5, 1978, to the Attorney General and signed
by. G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA.

g enumerated

"1, On what dates end for how long was N KO
questioned by the FBI about Lee Harvey Oswald—
from 1984 to present?"

The files of the FBI indicate that Yuri Ivanovich
Nosenko was interviewed regarding Oswald and/or the assassi-
nation.of President John F..Kennedy on February 26 and 27,

v4964,:and on Match 3,-4 and 6, 1964. The FBI files do not

record the specific duration in whole or in part as to

. topical-discussions, of those five interviews; however,
“Summa’

ommunications.indicate the February. 27, 1964 inter-
view was: conducted on the afternoon of that date and the
March 4,°1964 discussion ‘of. 0: 1d occurred at the outset
of an afternoon interview on that date.

"2, When Nosenko was.questioned by the FBI about
Lee Harvey Oswald, who did the questioning?"

The FBI interviews of Nosenko, during which he was
questioned about Oswald and/or the assassination of President
Kennedy, were conducted by Special Agents (SAs} Alekso
Poptanich, Maurice A. Taylor and Donald BH. Walter on
February 26 and 27, 19643 by SAs Poptanich and W. Marvin
Gheesling on March 3 and 4, 1964; and by SAs Poptanich,
Taylor and Walter on March 6, 1964.

"3, What background, if any, did the interro-
gator have in interrogations? What knowledge
did the interrogator.have with respect to. Oswald's
background?”

There are no retrievable FBI statistics upon which
to-base.a. quantification of the interrogatory experiences of
the SA personnel .who interviewed Nosenko on the five. pertinent
occasions... Suffice it.to say, the techniques of cooperative
and hostile interrogations are integral aspects of the training
and*almost. daily duties of SA personnel. In that regard, it
is noted that during the. February and March, 1964 interviews
SA Poptanich had almost 13 years of SA experience; SA Taylor
had over 31 years of SA experience; SA Walter had completed
almost 17 years of SA experience; and SA Gheesling had over
13. years of SA experience. Further, their respective personnel
files disclose the following:

SA Poptanich was then fluent in the Russian language
(Nosenko's native tongue). The Annual Report of Performance
Rating, dated March. 31, 1962, noted that SA Poptanich, during
the previous twelve months, had participated in the interro-
gation of a Soviet defector and his knowledge of the Russian
language and mores of the Russian people proved most helpful
relative thereto.

SA Taylor, on September 11, 1962, received an incen-
tive award in recognition of the superior fashion his responsi-
bilities were discharged over an extended period of time. The
Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the Washington Field Office,
in submitting a recommendation for the incentive award,
commented that SA Taylor had demonstrated exceptional ability
in the. interrogation and debriefing of three Soviet defectors,
all of ‘whom were intelligence officers. SA Taylor's Perfor-
hance Rating for the period April 1, 1963--March 31, 1964,
noted he was recognized as the finest interrogator on the
Soviet espionage squad.in the Washington Field Office, which
accounted for his assignments to interview Soviet defectors.

U.S. House of Representatives. (HSCA).

SA Walter was the recipient.of a personal letter of
commendation, dated October 3, 1963, from the Director, FBI,
for his superior work in the handling of a very sensitive,
complicated, fast moving, and highly publicized espion,

ge case.
Previously (on November 7, 1954), he had received « meritorius
salary increase for his outstanding work on another espionage
case, successful interrogation being the key aspect of that
investigation.

SA Gheesling, at the time of the pertinent Nosenko
interviews, served as a Supervisor at FBI Headquarters and
had considerable experience in espionage, intelligence and
counterintelligence investigations. SA Gheesling supervised
the field investigation of Oswald (from the latter's return to
the United States on Jue 13, 1962 until September, 1962, and
from November 22, 1963 through mid-1964). He was assigned
exclusively to supervisory responsibilities relative to the
assassination.of President Kennedy.

While the specific. knowledge of Oswald's back
ed‘by. these.SAs atithe time.of the Nosenko inter
‘answered only by the SAs themselves, 5A Gheesling's
prior ‘assignment to supervision of the Oswald investigation
would tend to indicate that he, at least, was quite knowledge-
able:of data contained.in FBI.files concerning Oswald.

"4, On the dates that Nosenko was questioned about
Ostiald, does there now exist or did there ever exist:
8. a tape of the questions esked and Nosenko's
answers;
b. 8 transeript of the questions asked and
Nosenko's answers;
¢...a summary of the questions.esked arid.
Nosenko's ensvrers?".

As noted in FBI memorandum dated June 19, 1978,
captioned as above, and which was prepared in response to HSCA
letter, dated Jue 13, 1978, to the Attorney General, FBI
records searches have not located any extant tape recordings

ov- verbatim transcripts of FBI interviews with Nosenko ‘that
concerned Oswald and/or the assassination of President Kennedy.
A document has been located. which indicates that FBI personnel
did record the February 26/and 27, 1964, interviews of Nosenko,
among others. Since'’no recordings or transcripts have been
Yocated, it can be assumed that the recordings were used by
the interviewing SAs to check the accuracy of their notes
prior to dictating the results of the interviews. It is
further assumed that, upon verifying the accuracy of summary
reportings of the interviews, the recordings were disposed of
since they had served the. purpose for which they were made,
although no record of such disposition can be found. Summary
reportings of the five pertinent interviews are extant, and
were delivered to the HSCA on March 21, 1978.

"5, What criteria, if any, was used to determine:
a. what subjects to question Nosenko abouts
b, how much time to devote to each subject?"

FBI files do not contain a specific enumeration of
criteria used to determine the particular subjects Nosenko
was to be questioned about nor the amount of time to be devoted
to each subject in .the questioning.

"§, What significance — with respect to possible
foreign involvement in the sssassination as yell

as to the issue of Nesenko's bonafides (sic}—did

the FBI attach during the years 1964-1968 to Nosenko's
statements about Oswald?"

The FBI, during the years 1964-1968, considered
Nosenko's statements about Oswald to be very significant elements
of his initial reportings, the veracity of which had to be
assessed in relation to the totality of information furnished
by him. The FBI perceived Nosenko's statements about Oswald,
depending upon a subsequent, definitive resolution of Nosenko's
bona fides, to be the most authoritative information available
indicative of a lack of Soviet governmental involvement in the
assassination of President Kennedy.

"7, What significance — with respect to possible
foreign involvement in the essassination as Well es
to the issue of Nosenko's bonafides (sic)—does

the FBI attach today to Nosenko's statements about
Oswald?"

The FBI does not perceive any signi ficant evidence of
foreign involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy,
nor does the FBI perceive. any credible evidence that Nosenko's
defection was a Soviet ploy to mask Soviet governmental
involvement in the assassination. Therefore, the FBI is
satisfied that Nosenko reported the facts about Oswald as he
imew then.

"8. If the answer to question 6 is different from
the response to question 7, when did the change
oceur and why?"

The FBI had no direct access to Nosenko from
April 3, 1964 until April 3, 1969, and therefore was not in
a position to make an objective assessment of his bona fides
nor “of. the veracity of information furnished by him. Thus,
information provided by him, in early 1984, was accepted at
face value and qualified in terms of the source and the
conditions under which it was received. On October 1, 1968,
the FBI‘ advised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that,
based.upon a review of material. provided by CIA, the FBI
found’no substantial basis to conclude that Nosenko was not
a.bona fide. defector;, however, the FBI did not reach any
overall, definitive conclusions regarding his bona fides
because ‘of a lack of access to Nosenko and all collateral
information pertinent to such an assessment. Effective
May 11, 1977, the CIA and FBI concurred that Nosenko was a
bona fide defector, based upon ‘an assessment of the
totality of. information furnished by him.

Hous® Select Committee on Assa

The FBI,,£rom 1964 to 1968, characterized Nosenko
as a Soviet: defector whose bona fides had not been established.

"10. What is the FBI's position today on the
question of whether Nosenko is bonafide (si¢}?"

a The FBI currently characterizes Nosenko as a
Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB) officer who
furnished reliable information in the. past, and consid
Nosenko tobe a. bona fide Soviet defector.

"IL. Ifthe answer to question 9 is different from
the response to question 10, when did the change

‘The answer to question 8 is considered responsive
to, question 11.

"12. What svas the PBI's position from 1964 to
1968 on whether Nosenko was telling the truth in
the statements he-made to the FBI about Oswald?"

The. FBI did not, take 2 position, from 1964 to 1968,
on whether Nosenko was telling the truth in the statements
he made to the FBI about Oswald. The statements were accopted
at face value and qualified in terms of the source and the
conditions under which they were received.

"13. What is the FBI's position today as to
whether Nosenko was telling the truth in the
statements he made to the FBI about Oswald?”

The FBI is satisfied that Nosenko truthfully
reported the facts about Oswald as he knew them.

House Select Comittee on As

U..S. House of Representatives (HSCA)

As indicated in the responses to questions 7 and 8,
the FBI, as of October 1, 1968, found no substantial basis to
conclude Nosenko was not a bona fide defector; as of May 1
1977, accepted a CIA assessment that Nosenko was a bona
degector;.and has not perceived any sign t evidence,
from 1964 to date, that Nosenko reported other than the facts
about Oswald as he knew them.

“5, Did either the FBI or the CLA have primary
responsibility for investigating Nosenko's state~
ments about Oswald? If neither had primary
responsibility, was there any division of
responsibility?"

The FBI had primary responsibility for investigating
Nosenko's statements about Oswald that pertained to his
(Oswald's) activities in the United States, including the
assassination of President Kennedy. The CIA had. primary
responsibility. for investigating Nosenko's statements about
Oswald's activities abroad.

"1g, . What communieation, if any, existed between
“the FBI and CIA with respect to evaluating and/or
investigating Nosenko's statements about Oswald?"

7 : ‘The FBI forwarded a'letter, dated March 6, 1964,
from the Director, FBI, to the Director, CIA, enclosing
memoranda dated February. 28, .1964,-and Narch 4, 1964, cap-
tioned "Lee ‘Harvey Oswald," which summarized the results of
FBI interviews of Nosenko regarding Oswald: on February 26
and 27, 1964, and-March 3 and-4,.1964.. The results of a CIA.
