advised Special Agent in Charge, JOSEPH F: SANTOIANA, JR.

that he has

been TRAFFICANTE's attorney since the middle

of the 1950's and in addition to being TRAFFICANTE'S

attorney is also very closely associated with him socially.

RAGANO stated that the La Stella Restaurant Meeting was a

social gathering consisting of nothing more than TRAFFICANTE

having dinner with old time friends and compared it as being

a similar gathering to the Apalachian gathering of friends.

Referenced San Diego airtel, copy of which was

furnished to New York, indicated that on March 9, 1967

SD1064-C-TE advised SAS EDWARD MARI

and JOHN D. ARMSTRONG

that approximately three months previously SANTO TRAFFICANTE,

JR.,

whom source had known for some 30 years was in Los

Angeles, California and during such time TRAFFICANTE commented

that the reason for the La Stella Restaurant Meeting was

serious internal problem within the New Orleans

"family" which

had

to be presented to the Commission or gunfighting would

have broken out.

San

Diego when disseminating this informa-

tion indicated

that it was not to be discussed with any in

dividual outside the Bureau and Tampa assumes that this in

dividual would not be available for testimony.
