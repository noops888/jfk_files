‘The conversation then turned to Costille’s recext vacation in Lapland.
Golub again told Costilie that he was nct going te be eble to teke

vacation thie year as the new A.bagsedor wanted tim to senein in Helsinki.
Goiub then stated to Contil'e, "I have heard that yoa speak flnert Russian.”
Costille stated that thet was very complimentary but that he epoke about

ae good Russian as Golub spoke Englich, Gostille taid hin that he had
studied Russian at the University of California and om hie own but that
about all he cowld do now was understand and read seas and that what littic
speaking ability he had waa practically gone. Golud coumented it vas

good that Costille kmew some Ruaciaa end said thai more Americans should
atudy it. Golub thea asked why Oostille was not trying to Leprove his
Russian, Costille anavered that he was trying to learn to speak Finnish
and that it was too much of a chore to stuly two lemzuages at the same tins.
Golub said that vhat Costille nected was more practice im Russian and pro~
oveded to speak in Russien, Ii adtuelity Qostille’s Ruseian bas decreased
considerably and he was able to sasily convince Gelub thet his Russian was
far from fluest, As waa mentioned in previous dispatohes, Costille had
never attempted to conosel from Golub the fact that he knew Russian, The
4esue just nover came tp, Since Golub is flusnt ia Finnish, the common
language eutosativally become Pimieh, If vo ha! realized thie Golub
contact was going to be so frequent, we would have made it a pcint at the
first to be the one to tell Golub that Contille kaowe como Russian, This
might have made Golub.a little suspicious, At the lest mocting Costille
had. mentioned to Golub that he had been studying Russian some, Golub

aid not respond, #0 evidently he either did not hear or understand Costille,

Golub asked Costille what other languages he hed statied, Costille toid
hia he hed atndied Spanish in high school, Golub said that this vas sn
easy languege and not stulied too much in the Soviet Union, After making
this remark, he quickly corrected hinself and stat~i that « large percentage
of the world spoke Spanish and thet it wau becoming @ much more populer
language in tha Soviet Union, Costille mentioned thet Russien kad becone
a very popular language in the States and thet withia the leat two years
his high school in California, which was quite anall, even ims offering the
Rusefen lenguage. This eesned to impress Golub.

Giese
Walle speaking Russian to Costille, Golub began using the familiar form of
the language rather than the polite form which the two had alvays used, He
looked at Costille and asked if it vould bo alright to use first nam
Whea Costille agreed, he reached across the table an: atook Coatille’s
hand. Ho than told Costille that wéy o ney Czitural Offfosr in the
