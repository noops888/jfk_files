INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY

SECRET

Papich began with a brief summary of his experi-

ence in the FBI.

During World War II and there-

after he ran certain operations in Latin America.

In 1945-47, he ran counterintelligence operations

in Brazil

against the Communist Party of Brazil

and bloc intelligence agents.

In 1952 he became

FBI liaison with CIA charged with coordinating

and planning, including the development of sources.

He also had special assignments overseas for Hoover.

Papich presented the following overview of the

issues.

He has a high respect and regard for the

Soviet

intelligence service, its efficiency, and

effectiveness.

He must be shown that their

philosophy has changed since 1970.

is no estimate of how many Soviet illegals are in

The old view was that illegals

would aim at middle-class government and business

positions.

It has been discovered that they take

jobs like dishwasher to develop an employment

background.

There is no knowledge of Soviet

objectives.

Illegals may do nothing for years so

they can be tapped

for the future.

There may be

100, 500, or 5,000 of them.

Some were sent in as

early as the 20's and 30's. They are the Rudolph

Abel-type. His network was never identified.

Therefore, Papich is clearly unhappy with U.S.

results in identifying Soviet operations in the

United States.

Papich

stated that he played a controversial

"devil's advocate" role between the

FBI and the

CIA.

He did not confer with Attorney General

Mitchell after Helms called his name to Mitchell's

attention.

Papich assumes Helms wanted Mitchell

to get a review of the history of FBI-CIA relations.

Papich would not have gone to Mitchell without

checking with other FBI officials.

To understand decisions in 1966 or 1970 it is

to go back to World War II, according

to Papich. President Roosevelt got the FBI into

the foreign intelligence field in World War II.

Overnight the FBI had to generate the capability

to move into Latin America against the German

espionage operation which included business covers,

radio networks, and influence in Latin American

In the field of political and psychological warfare

operations, the CIA didn't want stereotyped

But Beedle Smith was tough. Communi-

Papich had no CIA counterpart since the CIA is

so compartmented. He had contacts at all levels,

CIA did not have the capability to discover CPUSA

links to the Soviet Union.

There were no leads for

If a Communist Party member

The accepted view

at CIA was that it was impor-

tant to determine if there was foreign support

or

sabotage training.

After 1967, FBI-CIA contacts

on this topic developed rapidly. There were few

really valuable ClA results nor was much obtained

through the fBl, the legal attaches, or informants

going abroad.

Papich referred to the climate of press commentary,

assassinations,

allegations of sabotage plans,

bombings.

There was

"a potential for panic within

the intelligence community" since no one had the

coverage they thought they needed. Travel of U.s.

antiwar leaders to Communist nations seemed impor-

tant, although sometimes after inquiry the individuals

found not to be important.

Therefore, time was

spent on targets who should not have been targets

but this was a new task.

Hoover did not understand the issue.

He thought

New Left CPUSA links were most important. Papich

never thought the CPUSA responsible for development

of the New Left or SDS.

CPUSA did try to use the

New Left.

Hoover assumed the Soviets controlled

CPUSA day to day.

Some of his assumptions had

been proved wrong.

In World war II days, yes,

the Soviets used

CrusA for recruitment.

late 40's and 50's, the Soviets changed their

policy, no longer using CPUSA for this purpose.

Hoover

was never convinced of this change.

Papich

recognized

the possibility that there might be a

reversal of Soviet policy regarding CPUSA but

Papich's top concern has always been KGB penetra-

tion of CIA, FBI, NSA, etc., as well as the question

of how good

the double agents are.

Regarding the theory of KGB aims) for using U.S.

dissidents, the main problem was

lack of knowledge.

In the 40's and 50's, the FBI vas confident of its

knowledge of CPUSA and could assess its use to

influence U.S. politics, but in the late 50's

the Bureau's coverage of

groups was tremendously

The FBI recognized this.

The CIA stressed

it also for three reasons:

(1) the increase in FBI

requests for CIA information, ia: the white House

requests, and (3) CIA officials own concern about

inadequate coverage.

The conclision was that

intelligence regarding people ino went abroad was

Returning to the Riha incident, Papich stressed

that he clashed with Hoover

their relationship had declined

In December '69, he decided to retire the follow-

February 1970, while winding up

Professor Riha disappeared from the university.

There was faculty and press interest in Boulder,

Colorado, and a Congressional inquiry came to FBI.

But FBI opened no case or investigation.

In March

of 1970 the president of the University of Colorado

came to a CIA man in domestic contact service in

Boulder to inquire about the disappearance.

CIA man called two friends in the Denver FBI office.

Regarding the CIA and

local police, the only thing

Papich recalls is discussion of the CIA's relation-

ship with New York City police.

The purpose was

not operations, but protection of CIA New York

facilities.

He was also aware of relationships

between washington, D. C.,

and suburban police for

protection of CIA

facilities and personnel. He

•knew that some CIA employees joined questionable

groups and that the CIA was concerned about its

personnel associating with radicals and protesters.

The CIA Office of Security informed the FBI in

1967-1970 that it had developed

from two to six

sources to assess involvement of CIA personnel in

protest groups.

The information provided to the

FBI from these sources about such groups was "crap".

Papich was not involved in any meetings with CIA

He is not aware of any CIA activity re-

garding Women's Strike for Peace, nor was he aware

of any CIA intelligence operations for the purpose

of protecting CIA from violent demonstrations.

CIA should have relied

on FBI.

Bill Creager was succeeded as liaison with Office

of Security by Fred Cassidy.

They provided memo-

randa to the FBI Intelligence Division on all trans-

actions with CIA. Creager

kept Papich advised,

especially of the potential for flaps and for

successful operations.

Papich believes Office of

Security

was restricted both in number of personnel

and by CIA rules.

It could claim a need to protect

its own facilities and personnel but it didn't

have significant capability.

If it did, it would

have been detected by the FBI.

from Mexico City,

sent to the Dominican

Republic.

This was done with CIA approval and the

joint effort was successful.

There were no flaps.

The FBI agent had sources all over Central America

going back to World War I1.

Other FBI activities

in the Caribbean grew out of the FBI's role in

Havana before Castro, Jamaica, Miami, and San Juan.

on personal relationships going back to World

War II. In the late 1960's, the FBI went into

El Salvador and Papich thought this was a waste

of FBI manpower.

Regarding Cubans in Miami, there were many flaps

with CIA. For example, CIA would attempt to

recruit an exile for an operation in Cuba, the

exile would ask the FBI about it, and Hoover would

get mad. The FBI would not be informed about CIA

cover companies screening exiles.

The FBI investi-

gated one cover company until it discovered the

CIA cover.

CIA tried to recruit FBI sources with-

out checking out FBI. Papich is sure CIA "must

have" used agents to

cover local Miami Cubans.

But FBI had excellent coverage and would protest

when CIA took an interest in somebody FBI was

investigating.

There would be general protests

co CIA to stav out of counterintelligence.

Some

roblems were resolved locally with the FBI agent

in charge.

There was minimum FBI contact with

CA operations..

Some names involved here are

weddy Fronbose deceased; Bill Harvey; and a (S)

Fitzgerald.

Regarding CIA counterintelligence against Cubans

in New York, Papich said the policy was no

counterintelligence by CIA. He has no recollection

of CIA implication in anti-Castro Cuban 11legal

activities, but Papich admits he would have learned

only if there was a flap.

Regarding CIA Domestic Operations Division, Papich

formulated the 1966 agreement to ease FBI relation-

ships.

The problem, as noted earlier, was CIA

tonaththe_U. N. Hoover finally, reluctantly,

Papich warned

CIA that if there were continuing flaps, Hoover

would withdraw his agreement and

"it would be my

butt".

There were flaps from 1966 to 1970 where

Domestic Operations Division attempted to recruit

and failed to advise FBI.

If CIA was interested

in a Soviet bloc intelligence

service recruitment,

FBI said no.

If either Domestic Operations Division

or the counterintelligence staff

was interested in

any Soviet in the U.S.,

they

touched base with FBI.

But they felt that if FBI had

allowed them to

recruit they could have succeeded.

got FBI data on the alien and FBI had notice so

it could protect any operation.

Regarding possible spies in foreign intelligence

agencies,

if the FBI discovers any it evaluates

the potential for a double agent or the possibility

of recruitment.

FBI usually goes to the agency and

tells them the situation to prevent access to

sensitive information.

Also, the agency can give

FBl assistance.

The CIA Office of Security is

"paranoid" on this subject.

It is very concerned

if there is a report on a CIA employee associating

with bloc nationals.

Before telling the FBI, it

would do as much as it could on its own so there

would be something to discuss. In one case the

CIA was absolutely convinced an employee was a spy,

predicated on its analysts' conclusions from a

photograph. FBI refused to move on the basis of

this alone.

There were other cases where FBI and

CIA had different evaluations of evidence. It

depended on what CIA gave FBI. CIA was "jumpier"

than FBI.

If CIA did any electronic surveillance of its own

employees, it never checked with FBI. The same was

true for physical surveillance of its own employees.

If the FBI had known, it would have raised hell,

but it never came to

FBl attention and there was

no policy discussion of the subject.

If the CIA

wanted to do something with its own assets with

Attorney General or White House approval, it would

not check with FBI. But it would coordinate with

FBI 1f it saw a risk that FBl would discover.

Papich recalls no CIA surveillance of newsmen.

Papich adds his view that every newsman assigned

to Moscow is useful to the rub.

target in
