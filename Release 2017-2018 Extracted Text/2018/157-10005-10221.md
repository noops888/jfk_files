Subject:

DOCUMENTS FROM DPD FILES RELATED TO

CUBAN OPERATIONS DURING THE PERIOD 1959 - 1961

Today, May 21, 1975, Joe Seltzer furnished me a

group of documents, totaling about one-quarter inch in thick-

ness, which were compiled by

Fof the DDO. These

are the documents described in paragraph two of the May 15,

1975, memorandum from the Agency entitled "AMB Research of DPD

Files

Related to Cuban Operations."

Paragraph two of this memo

reads:

"A number of documents were found

that referred to the

intent on the part of some Cuban teams operating inside Cuba to

attempt to assassinate Castro. • Also, there is mention of the

air drop of Springfield rifles with telescopic sights."

Items of interest in this group of documents

are as follows:

1.

Memorandum for the record, unsigned, undated,

Subject:

"First Meeting of Branch Four

Task Force, 9 March

1960. "

This memo outlines the meeting of the Branch Four

Group which apparently was to concern itself with covert

operations against Cuba.

The memo relates that Colonel King

gave a brieting at this meeting, one aspect of which was as

follows: "He said that unless Fidel and Raul Castro and "Che"

Guevara

could be eliminated in one package--which is highly

unlikely--this operation can be a long, drawn out affair and

the present government will only be overthrown by the use of

force."

There are no other references in this memo to elimina-

tion or assassination of Castro. It appears to be a general

discussion of necessary support for covert operations against

Cuba.

3. Cable, dated April 4, 1961, to BELL fxom RIMMa

This cable, written in Spanish, appears

to be a request from

an agent within Cuba that certain equipment be air-dropped to

him.

Among the items requested in this cable, are one .50-

caliber machine gun, two boxes of Springfields with telescopic

sights, plus other weapons and rockets.

This appears to be

[Note that this cable and the preceeding one were also sent

to the DDP as an info copy.] This cable recounts another •

message apparently received from an agent within Cuba.

The

agent who sent this message had the cryptonym "NOTLOX." The

English translation of this cable reads as follows:

"Plan (4) 9 April. Fidel will talk at the

palace.

6. Cable, dated April 5, 1961, to BELL frOm RAMM

This cable, an information copy of which

was sent to the bap

transmitted a message received from an agent within Cuba,

whose cryptonym was NOTLOX. The English translation of this

message is as follows:

"Your message 15. Brand, Chacho, and Luis

only have arms for 50 men. Blowing up (of)

central electric plant and possibly attempt

on Fidel will be decidedly carried out

Your military aid is decisive.

Cable, dated January 9, 1961, to JMBELI

from Guatemala. This cable reads in part as follows:

reflects information received by the CIA that certain people

in Guatemala were targets of Cuban assassination plots. I

would speculate that the two acronyms, rESOLEO-land ESVEHICLE=

refer to Cuban exile leaders who at that time were in training

in Guatemala for the Bay of Pigs mission.

8. Cable, dated June 4, 1961, to BELL from RIMM, .

info copy to DDP. This message transmits a message received

from the agent NOTLOX from within Cuba. Its English trans~

lation reads as follows:

This message would seem to indicate that an assassination plan

may have still been in existence in June of 1961, after the

failure at the Bay of Pigs and of the assassination attempt

discussed above.

Apparently the agent NOTLOX was not arrested

in April, since

he is still sending messages in June.

9. Cable, dated May 3, 1961, to BELL from [UMRIMM;

This message transmits another one received from an agent

inside Cuba.

The cryptonym of this agent was TEKLOK. The

English translation of the message reads as follows:

"We are contacting all groups (dos) to

organize one united front with a coordina-

tor. You name him or we elect him. Tell

us. Will try kill Fidel today. Andres OK

Note that this is a second agent within Cuba to

transmit a message dealing explicitly with the subject of

assassination.

It should be noted that I did not search the files

Nothing in this package of documents would allow me to deter-

mine the true identities represented by the cryptonyms of the

Nor is it

possible to identify the agents within Cuba identified by the

above cryptonyms.. When I returned these documents to Seltzer,

I requested that he determine the true identities of the

possessors of these cryptonyms and also seek to obtain copies

of any replies the CIA may have sent in response to these

messages coming out of Cuba relating to the assassination of

Fidel.
