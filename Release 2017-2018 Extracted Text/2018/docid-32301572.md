Intormant (vello Alpizar • protect) that William-

learned throughJFK)

Johnson, a U.S, citizen, pilot and businessman, with the approval of

Dr. Orlando Bosch, head of liki, is planning to rent an airplane in

Florida, fly it to the Bahamas and then assist Alpizar, who is a pilot,

group conspiring to do this in order to develop information of value to

the Government.

We have given all information developed to date to all

interested agencies and on 12/12/63 instructed Miami to see that U.S.

Bureau of Customs was fully apprised of all data developed since that

agency has. been investigating Johnson and his activities on behalf of

the MIRR since last Summer,

and is in position to seize any boat or

plane; which may be utilized in a raid over Cuba.

This afternoon Departmental Attorney John Davitt telephoned

and referred to the foregoing information. He said Department wants to

prevent any raid over Cuba and

asked that we notify Bureau of Customs

of this tact, pointing out that a boat which the group plans to use in

transporting munitions to the Bahamas for use of the raiding plane

should be, seized under Title 22, U.S. Code, Section 401,

exporting of any such munitions would be in violation of Title 22, U.s.

Code, Section 1934 (which is under Customs' investigative jurisdiction).

Davitt said Department is desirous of having the action stopped without

any arrests being made if possible, but if necessary to stop the action,

arrests would be permissible.

He said the main concern here is to

prevent the boat with munitions aboard from

departing U.s.

"He also

pointed out that it is desirous that Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) take

whatever action it can to prevent the p

plane from leaving this country

for

It was

explained to ur is

DaVittuthat Customs and FAA, both in

Miami and here at Seat of Government, had been furnished full information

In this matter and that customs is in a position to exercise its

seizurel powers: in miami to prevent the

raid from happening,: It was

suggested,

therefore, that he might desire to deal directly with Customs
