4. ‘Reference C is a chronological stimmary of ANKINT-33's
activities subsequent to his infiltration in PBHUMEN, and his
‘contacts with Chelin, the brother of AMFRET-7.  AMFRET-7's arrest
‘was reported in Reference B, The AMFRET-7 Caso Officer states
that both ANFRET-7 and his brother were arrested, after shooting \£4-
it out with G-2 and being wounded. OlAs avted in Reference D, <7 es
ANFRET-7'8 arrest was mado after [QUANTUN-55]and Blanca FeMARTINEZ [Sosy
de Hoya, aka "Cuca," gka "Cuchi, “brought MEDINA, AMSPELL's National—
Military Coordinator for Reception and Supply, to Iden A where
NEDINA recognized AMMINT-33. AMIINT-33 said MEDINA was an old

friend of his ond had lived near him. RE G-2 PANE TRAWEN

S$. AMHINT-33 said further that his brother knows MEDINA, t ae
MEDINA ts the man whom AMHINT-33 used in 1961 tu check up on *REBELLOD

his S/W Messago 11 of 10 Docember 1962 that “bls friends" are still

in jail,

8. Reference E transmitted a Ictter written by AMHINT-33
on 29 December 1962 in which he states that G-2 infiltration is so
great that he considers it impossible to organize anything, ani he
indicates that some of the agents, as in this cane, have been infil-
trated for more than two years, He presumably means infiltrated
into anti-CASTRO organizations and/or activities,

8. JMWAVE traces on the individuals avers in this-plot—-
offer little concrete information.

a, It is noted that Jorge MEDINA Bringuier is listed
on Page 13 of Attachment C to UFGA-1977 as an MRR member, with w
listed aka of Carlos PRADO. JMNAVE tracing identifies one Carlos
PRADO as “a brother of Raul, the head of G-2 in Las Villas Province,"
as-reported in HAVA-6437, 5 October 1960; there is no further informal
tion on this Carlos PRADO. However, the original source of the info:
ation given in Attachment C of UFGA-4977 was a letter brought out
of PBRUMNEN by AMSTRUT-1 about early July 1962) Said letter contained
a $25 money order, issued at Station No. 9, New Orleans, on
16 March 1962, for Jorge MEDINA Bringuicr and purchased by Maria
Teresa MEDINA. The envelope, addressed to Sra. Consuclo.C. de
RIVAS in Mexico City, bore the notation, "For Carlos PRADO,” and
contained a note, “This money order for $25 is for Carlos PRADO
from his mother," in addition to the moncy order. There is one

Carlos PRADQ in Mexico. He ts_study ing engineering and is the | 9

This PRADO family is a large one, and includes anothey brother,

c. It is noted that Reference F identifios Jorge
HAEDO as & former-anti-Castrista who was tortured and doubled by.
the PBKUMEN Government; HAEDO appears to be the correct spelling.

. "Cuca" or "Cuchi" MARTINEZ, who has held the position
of AMSPELL National Coordinator for Civil Resistance, is a personal
friond.of ANCOG-3 and. family. She is believed to have taken asylum
in the Mexican Embassy. SW Messnge 12 from AMCOG-3, dated
8 December 1962 and received 12 December, reported that [QUANTUM- i] 01
advised “Cuca! to hide or be cautious because MEDINA had turned of
to be a G-2 member. The message said that this was lcarned from
AMSPELL prisoners and that, during interrogation, they wore asked
many questions about "Cuca" and ANCOG-2.

9. When the AMHINT-53 sccurity review mentioned in Reference A
is received, additional investigation us necessary will be made at
