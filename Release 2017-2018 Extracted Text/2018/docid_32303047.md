The Cubans

ADMINISIRATIVE

It is noted that it was set out in rerep that PCI JAMES

THORNTON MCCLOWRY, MD, Springdale, Pa., advised that Father

NICOLA FUSCO, Pastor of Me. St. Peters Roman Catholic

Church, New Kensington, Pa., was close to the MANNARINOS;

and in late 1958, hid SAMUEL MANNARINO in the church!s

apostulate house when SAMUEL MANNARINO was being sought

for service of a subpoena.

on July 23, 1959, PCI MCCLOWRY advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH;

III, as follows:

On about July 13, 1959; Father FUSCO asked PCI if he would

give SAM MANNARINO a thorough physical examination. PCI

replied that if cancer were indicated, he could do nothing

for MANNARINO, at which point Father FUSCO indicated he knew.

that MANNARINO was suffering fron a malignancy. PCI feels

there are only two reasons why he should be approached to

examine MANNARINO: eithe SAM MANNARINO is frightened and

Looking desperately for other, contrary medical opinion;

or MANNARINO intends to "use"

PCI-by having him subpoenaed

at a later date to testify that MANNARINO 1s too ill to appear

in any court proceeding.

PCI wanted to know if there was any

reason the FBI would not want him to examine SAM MANNARINO,

and PCI was advised that any decision along this line was his

alone.

On September 15, 1959, PCI McCLOWRY advised that Father

FUSCO and his chauffeur departed on September 11, 1959, by

jet airline flight to Rome, Italy, purpose of visit unknown.

PCI stated that this trip was paid for in its entirety by

the MANNARINOs. PCI also advised that prior to Father

FUSCO's depature, Father FUSCO told PCI that it would not

be necessary for him to give a physical examination to

SAMUEL MANNARINO, inasmuch as MANNARINO has become more or

less resigned to the inevitability of his death from his

cancer.
