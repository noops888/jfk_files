coincidence, a coincidence due in part to the Soviet hebdt of placing intelligence
men tn the Eubassies in positions where they receive a large portion of the
visitors and phone calls. All of the five consular officers in the Soviet Embassy

KGB agent on 4 sensitive misalon to have such overt coutact with a Soviet
Eubessy, top seeret Soviet intelligence docunents which cet forth Nilitary
Intelligence doctrine state that very Important agents can be met in official
installations using as cover for their presence there some sort of open
