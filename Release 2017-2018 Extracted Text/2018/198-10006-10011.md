THE MOVEMENT OF SUBVERSIVES

AND SUBVERSIVE TRAINEES

I.

Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede the

flow of subversives between Cuba and other Latin American

countries. Execution of any one or more of the enumerated

actions will amellorate the situation; execution of them

all will not completely solve it. The practical.

problems

involved are too numerous and complex.

With respect to diminishing legitimate travel to Cuba,

we face multiple problems in the policies and attitudes of

those Latin American countries through which the subversive

traveller must pass. From the viewpoint of these nations

the direct actions required have strong political and some-

times legal implications; implications which cannot be over-

come easily, even where the leaders of these countries

choose to do so.

In the matter of clandestine travel, we are confronted

not only with the great depth of communist guile, born.of two

generations of experience in the international movement of

but with the inexperience, ineptitude and

lack of awareness in these same matters on the part of

the Latin American community

In spite of this, the advantages

do not all reside

with the communists.

Cuba is an island. Its insular

character imposes certain sharp limitations upon personal

movement. Cuba has no frontiers with other states; every-

one who enters the country must do so either by water,

or air. There can be no slipping through the barbed wire.

the

lorafin

On the other hand, this same geographic situationg tabra

makes clandestine entry and exit reasonably simple. There

are 3,825 linear miles of essentially unpatrolled Central

American coastline, between 175 and 850 miles of. Cuba, There

are at least 93. airfields, other than United States, within

700 miles of the island, and the ships and craft, indigenous

to

the Caribbean and capable of supporting the subversive

ebb and flow, number well into the thousands.

Even in the face of these unfavorable factors, a

program of direct restraints, selected from among the actions

enumerated herein, can have favorable effects. Under the

proposed steps some travel would be stopped completely.

More - probably much more - would be rendered difficult.

Some hitherto legitimate movement would be driven underground.

Nature and Scope of the Problem

We do not know enough about the movement of subversive

trainees into Cuba and - more important - out of Cuba. We

do not know enough about the volume of travel, or the media

employed. This is particularly true in the area of 1ll1cit

traffic, where our knowledge is extemely limited.

Regarding legitimate travel to Cuba, CIA presents the

following estimate:

While some of these travellers proceeded to Cuba by

other routes, the great majority passed through Mexico on

their way. Or the most conservative basis, then, it will

be seen that there cannot have been fewer than 4912 travellers

to Cuba during the year 1962, while the average monthly

number passing through Mexico for the first two months of

1963 1s even higher than the 1962 average.

SeenatE

premises prize

Of the total number visiting Cuba, the Central Intelli-

gence Agency estimates that at least 1500, and perhaps as

many as 2000, have received Ideological Indoctrination or

guerrilla warfare training. Many of these are still in

Cuba. Others have returned to their homelands; some by

legitimate means; some probably by 11l1cit means / suLAs?

Prior to the October crisis, Latin Americans travelling

to cuba usually moved by regular commercial airlines or, on

occasion, by specially chartered Cubana flights. Some

travelled to Trinidad or Curacao and thence by regularly

scheduled Cubana or KLM flights to Havana. ' Others travelled

to Mexico, and from there by Mexicana or Cubana commercial

flights to Havana. With the cessation of service to Cuba

by Pan American, KLM, Mexicana, and Iberia airlines in

October, the regular Cubana service between Mexico City

and Havana remained the sole direct and regular airline

connection betwen Cuba and the remainder of Latin America.

The Cubana service between Havana and Mexico is scheduled

to operate twice weekly, but sometimes only a single flight is

completed per week. Aircraft now employed are British Bri-

tannias -- an obsolescent model. Cubana has requested, but

has not yet received, Mexican approval to substitute Soviet

IL-18 transports for the old Britannias. Delay by the Mexicans

in granting this approval can have the favorable effect of

impeding travel, as the Britannias are now in poor condition.

If, In addition, the British and Canadians can be induced to

suspend dellvery of spare parts, the planes will soon become

inoperative.

Iberia airlines resumed its regular twice-monthly

flights from Madrid to Havana on 11 February. This flight

makes one stop, in the Azores, before reaching Havana.

KIM has not yet resumed its regular flights to Cuba

from the Netherlands Antilles. However, It is now considering

sidled

doing so. In this regard it is concluded that resumption of

scheduled flights by a United States carrier could serve as

an encouragement to KIM and others to do the same.

Soviet

and Czech airlines serving Cuba do not stop

regularly at any other Latin American country, though the

Soviet Aeroflot line has occasionally sought and received

permission from Brazil to land at Recife, en route

to Cuba.

Some Latin Americans may have travelled to Cuba on these

infrequent flights and, should Brazil permit this arrange-

ment to become regularized, the movement of subversives

could achieve a new order of magnitude.

A Canadian non-scheduled line has operated a few

flights from Canada to Havana and return, carrying both

material and personnel. The Canadians have been unrespon-

sive to our efforts to obtain identification of the passengers.

There are no

regularly scheduled sea carriers operating

between Latin America and Cuba.

However, a number of

trainees

from British Guiana have travelled to Cuba aboard unscheduled

Cuban merchant vessels engaged in transporting rice from

Guiana to Cuba.

Clandestine sources report that transit of Latin

Americans through Mexico to Cuba often involves illict pro-

cedures. The Cuban embassy in Mexico City provides the

travellers, whom they identify as tourists, with special

Cuban entry papers; no entry is made in their passports,

and they are given pseudonyms for travel out of and into

Mexico. This procedure is obviously designed to impede

any effort by the other Latin American governments

subse

quently to identify the travellers and to exercise surveil-

lance over their activities upon their return.

doubtedly assume growing proportions as legal travel is

curtailed, and about which our intelligence 1s at present

III. The attitudes of the Latin American Nations

Success of many of the overt actions proposed in

the sections to follow will turn upon the attitudes of the

Latin American nations within whose borders the restraining

actions must take place. Presented briefly below is an

estimate of what can be expected

from the various sectors .

öf Latin America in terms of participation in a coordinated

program of travel control.

As a general matter, the imposition of controls on

AtleAstApproawareness of the danger represented by cuba's training of

Some

subversives, will diminish the willingness of some govern-

ments to impose controls unilaterally. This is especially

true since they recognize that unilateral restraints will

have little effect on curbing the travel of their nationals

to Cuba, if supporting multilateral action is not also taken.

It is lIkely, however, that most of the Latin American

countries would respond favorably - albeit in varying

degrees - to US leadership in seeking to reduce the flow

of persons to Cuba for ideological or subversive training.

The Central American countries are more acutely aware

of the danger posed by Cuban-inspired subversion than is

Latin America at large, and can be expected to react

favorably to proposals for reducing travel to cuba which

President Kennedy might present at the San Jose Presidential

meeting. However, their ability to carry out commitments

made under such circumstances will be limited by domestic

legal and political considerations, as well

as by their

countries' technical incompetence in such

matters.

Since Mexico is currently the only hemisphere transit

point for legal travel of subversives to and from Cuba, the

attitude of that country toward

the problem is of great

Importance. Mexico, to date, has taken three significant

steps with respect to travel between Mexican cities and

Cuba. It has instituted close surveillance over travellers,

to include stamping passports to evidence travel to Cuba.

In addition, the Mexicans now photograph, covertly, all

persons

arriving from or departing for Cuba, and have given

taçit approval to suspension of Cuban service by Compania

Mexicana de Aviacion (CMA). These actions all suggest that

Mexico might be induced to take even further cooperative

steps, particularly on an unpublicized, bi-lateral

basis,

wherein the political hazards of a public lAs position are

not involved. In this regard, the Central American Presidents

would probably agree individually to seek the participation

of President Lopez Mateos of Mexico in specific cooperative

moves to restrict the flow of persons to Cuba through that

country.

Latin American countries to take a grave view of the situ-

ation, and to participate in dynamic action.

IV• Actions Concerning Legitimate Travel

Listed below are specific actions contemplated to

impede legitimately executed travel, to and from Cuba.

Legitimate travel is characterized, for this purpose,

as travel on recognized public carriers, openly arranged

and involving travel documents which are presumed to be in

proper order. Certain of the actions, it will be noted,

are partially in effect. Others have been proposed to the

OAS - wholly or in part - by the Special Consultative

Committee on Security.

a. Immediate Impact Actions

The following actions offer promise of producing

early, visible and effective results.

(1) Intelligence Actions

(a) Intensify US* intelligence efforts in

each country to identify persons who have traveled,

or intend to travel, to Cuba, and report selected

information promptly to the host government, as

may be consistent with our own

intelligence pro-

gram, and the requirement to protect our sources.

(b) Intensify current efforts to introduce

covert, Us. - controlled agents from each country

into the Cuban training program.

(2) Administrative Actions

(a) Induce each Western Hemisphere country to:

issued to own nationals "not valid for travel

to Cuba"

2. Refuse exit permits for Cuba to any

national of a third country who cannot produce

a valid permit issued by his own country for

travel to Cuba.

3. Refuse to honor any visa for Cuba which

is not an integral, non-detachable part of the

travel document issued by the country of which

the traveller is a citizen.

4 Require accurate manifests of all carriers

departing for or arriving from Cuba, and furnish

copies of these manifests to diplomatic missions

of: other Western Hemisphere countries which are

affected.

(b) Persuade Mexico to fingerprint, in addition

to photographing, all persons leaving for or arriving

from Cuba, and to provide data to the parent country

of the nationals involved.

(c) Make covert arrangements with police and

other security and administrative officials in

to impose administrative impediments and harassment

on Cuba-bound travellers, in order to increase the

need to halt the travel of Latin American

nationals to Cuba.

Longer Range Actions

The following actions should also be undertaken

without delay. Their ultimate results may be of far-

reaching importance, but probably will be longer

in realization.

(1) Political Actions

(a) Renew and intensify bilateral negotiations

with the five Latin American governments which

have

not done so to sever diplomatic relations with

Cuba-

(b) Through bilateral negotiations press

countries with inadequate legal restrictions on

Wen travel to cuba to adopt laws enabling the prohibi-

tion of such travel and providing severe penalties

for evasion. Recommend that rewards be offered

for identification of evaders.

(c) In separate diplomatic approaches to each

country, urge full and effective cooperation with

appropriate OAS bodies, and bilaterally among the

several states, in the interchange of information

concerning travel of persons to Cuba and other

Castro-Communist subversive activities.

and develop popular opposition to such activities.

(b) Identify returned trainees who are dis-

exploit theer capabilities for provision of intelli-

gence and propaganda material for exposing and

discrediting Castro-Communist subversive activities.

(c) Initiate a publicity campaign throughout

which focusses unfavorably on the use of Mexican,

Uruguayan, Brazilian, and Chilean transit facilities

for movement af persons of other countries to and

from Cuba for subversive purposes.

c. Organization of American States (OAS) Actions

In view of the important political, psychological,

and, hopefully, material benefits to be derived from

any success achieved through the OAs in combatting

Cuban

subversive activity, the following measures

should be pursued by the United States in that body,

at times and under circumstances which give regard to

the need to preserve hempaphase solidarity, and

give recognition to the fact that progess will

probably be slow.

(1) Pursue adaption by the OAs of a

resolution

calling upon all member states to sever diplomatic

relations with Cuba, thus impeding the travel of

subversives to Cuba by legal means, and at the same

time, creating serious obstacles to other related

cuban subversive activities.

(2) Propose a recommendation by the AS to member

governments of a program of steps, on both the

national and international levels, to control travel

by their nationals to cuba, utilizing the proposals

in the report by the Special Consultative Committee

on Security (SCCS) as well as the specific recommen-

dations set forth herein.

(2) above is recommended, utilize the appropriate

OAs bodies to follow up on implementation through

such means as multilateral exchange of information,

meeting of experts, and

' utilization by individual

countries of the services of the Special Consultative

committee on security.

(4) Propose adoption by the OAS of a resolution,

binding upon all member states, to terminate air and

heye

maritime carrier traffic with Cuba.

(5) Recommend action by the OAS to establish a

public information program focussing on the threat

to the hemisphere posed by Cuban subversive training

activities.

Actions Concerning Illegal Travel

As the actions outlined in the preceding sections

become effective, one of the results will be to force the

hitherto legitimate

travel into clandestine channels. It

may, therefore, be expected that measures to impede illegal

movement will acquire steadily increasing importance.

The steps proposed herein are listed, as in the

preceding section, in terms of immediate Impact projects

which promise early and visible results, and longer range

projects which, while of great importance, cannot be ex-

pected to mature as rapidly.
