Interviewed on 24 Feb 6h, Hieserived the circuzstances

ne recorded statement ay follows:

1, "Zn connection with ey Spaniéh language radio
prograg, ac vell ac in furthevunce of my jersonal interests
in Cuban affairs, I contrived to interview Manuel (Manolo)
RAY cr the occasion of his visit and upeech at Los Angeles
on © Dec 63, RAY Is the leader of the cupposedly unti-Castro
group known ag JURE, or Junta Revolucfonuria Cubana. The
interview, with RAY's permissfon, wuu taped while we vere
proceeding via Volkswayen to the airport. RAY's chauffeur,
sieniffcantly, wos a JURE surrorter, Manolo GONZALEZ who,

T recall, was emotionally condemning the US in front of the
oa Angeles Civic Center at the time of the aboftive Buy of
Pigs invasion attempt. !

2. "As you will note in the taped record, I wos
brutally franz with RAY, [t vas my Intention to try to
convince him that his stand did not dfffer markedly fron
Keither KAY, sor JURE, une prone
to attack Castro frontally, Ir response to every tininy

to soclaltem {s pitifully obvious, and reminds me once
more that he did not break vith Caswre, It was Castro

that of the Communists,

3. "As you will note, KAY espouses pudlie ownership
of electric power facilities, transportation, communications,

etc, His defense is vased exclisively on the allegation, y
—_

probably true, that the extension of electric power into
rurel Greas {6 not economically feasible, hence neglected
ty private industry. No other reason lo advanced for the
natlonalization of other inductrie: At any rate, RAY
speaks for hiself in the inicrview, and in the unhappy,
but unlikely event that RAY und JURE ever come to prominence
in Cuba, with or without U government ald, the record will
have nore iecediate and core devastating significance, As
a catter of fact, one would do well to translate, transcribe

and study it.”

Subject: Caze 42315 - Manolo Ray/JURE

I heard Manolo Ray's specch to tho Cuban exiles in Los Angeles,

1.
Tre

and also rat an opportunity to visit with him for e few minutes.
following 1s my evaluation of Ray.

2. Ray tries to make clear that tho Cuban problem is a Cuban
problem, should te handled by Cubans, and should iit Ve considered as
an international situation. Ife saya tit the Cubans in the US cannot
cit and vait for things to change. At the same time, he decries any
kind of diserimination in employment of Cuban exiles in the U3, claiming
that their siiils anc their hopes will deteriorate. I suspect that he
feels that they will not ve able to contrivute financially if they are
not employed, also. He makes a big point, too, that they must rely
heavily on the people within Cubs, adding that there are many there who
gust cooperate now in order to get work and fool, but that in their
hearts they are not pro-Fidel. le vants then particularly to get the
nescnge that he is not against they but necdy their help.

s to faver a vovernmental system Like Puerto Rico's.
Likes what he described as a “coorerative oyutem,” and praises the
idea of governsent autonomous corporations. At the same time, he says
he 1 in favor o* caintaining private property ant supporting education.
ifs aim, he cays, is first to get Cuba out of the Soviet arca, and then
into the dezocratic area, but adds that it would not ve proper to trade
a leftist ciecatorship for a rightist.

4, Of gone 400 or 500 people who heard Ray speak, most were soze-
Vint indifferent, even eritical at first, uut at the end seemed to

approve.
