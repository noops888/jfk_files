ACCOMPANIED BY SCOTT s. BRECKINRIDGE, JR., DEPUTY
INPSECTOR GENERAL, ENHO KNOCHE, ASSISTANT TO THE
DERECTOR, AND GEORGE L. CARY, LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL

Mr. Colby. I have an answer to a few of the questions
that were raised at the meeting the other day and there are a
couple of clarifications I would lixe to make.

One, with’ respect to the security investigations in the
United States. The question Was asked whether we ever used
private investigators, and I said we normally used eur’ own
investigators. We have some relationships with private
investigatory firms which provide cover for our investigators
and, secondly, we have a few firms which we CVn which are

Proprietary: if you will, whereby our investisators appear to

be private.

I said that in the past it is. clear that on occesion we
did ask for private investigator firms to help us to some
degree. tt was usually the one that was giving us cover, and
for reasons of overload we asked them to have their own people
to doa few of the investigations.

My General Counsel says that this is illegal. I have a
strong question about its propriety, if not legality, and I
am undertaking to revicw this matter to see whether we can not
just eliminate that practices entirely, continuing the preprie-

tary ane continuing the ase cf private investigators as cever

But I did want te clarify that. I think “Z mentioned it

: |
last time that there have been occasions on which this was |

done.

Chairman Church, Mr. Colby, would you in connection with
your review of this matter supply the Committee with the spe-
cifics in those cases where the Agency has in fact engaged
private investigators to do Agency work?

Mr. Colby. “I will certainly try to, Mr. Chairman, I
confess this may be a tough job to locate every case but I
certainly will do my best.

Chairman Church. Will you provide the Committee with the
opinion of your Counsel with respect to the legality of such?

Mr. Colby. I will. :

Chairman Church. Such use of private

nvestigators?
Mr. Colby. Yes.
Chairman Church. And then I would ask the staff aiso

furnish ths Committee with a brief on that question so that we

are-fully advised with respect to the law.

Mr. Colby. Right.

The second subject, Mr. Chairman. Senator Mondale asked
for our command and control regulations for the approval of
covert action projects, These were supplied to the staff on
the first of May and are available to the staff.

Vhirdly, £ was asked if Mr. -Willian Harvey was removed

from the Agency bocause of his involvement in the assassinatioy,

plans ‘against Prime Minister Castro.

fhe facts are-that in June 1963 he was assigned .

_Ch of stathongin ana in February of '67 he was ...-73-

reassigned to CIA Headquarters. He retired voluntarily under
our retirement system on 31 of December 1967. ,

If I may, there is a reason why he was taken out and if f
could go off the record and mention that to the Committee. It
is a matter of his privacy.

Chairman Church. Very well, off the record.

(O£E the record discussion)

Mr. Colby. - Back on the record.

Senator Schweiker.asked me whether Howard Hunt or Janes

McCord were in charge of Mexican operations at the time of
Président Kennedy's assassination on 22nd of November '63.

- Howard Hunt from July '62 to August '64 was assigned as a
Section Chief in the Division of Plans Directorate, which is
now the Operations Directorate at CIA Headquarters, which had
no responsibility whatsoever for Mexican operations.

Senator Schveiker. What were those dates again?

Mr. Colby. July '62 to August ‘64.

Senator Schweiker. Wasn't he at some point in Mexico
city and in charge of that office? _

Mr. Knoche. Way back in the '50's he served in Mexico

Senator Schusiker. So that is the period you are Sayi

he had no jurisdiction in any way with Latin America or Mexicar
Affairs. -

Mr. Colby. No, he was in what we call, and we have since
changed the name, to Domestic Operations Division at that time;
our operations here in this country, and that is a whole

different subject I would have to explain some day.

Mr. McCord from June '62 to June '64 was assigned as a

CIA Security Officer in

and he had no responsibilities for Mexican operations at that
point.
Senator Morgan last time asked what information was given

to the Warren Commission concerning Agency assassination plans

concerning Castro, and I have been advised our records do not

tion on this subject.

Allen Dulles, of course, I would notes, who was the CIA
pixsctor until the fall of ‘61, was a member of the Warren
comission, but beyond thet fact I have nothing I could offer.

And then who made the decision not to provide it, if none
was given? ‘our records do not indicate that there was a CIA
decision on this matter not to tell the Warren Commission.

I could add that I believe the relationship with the

Warsen Commission was handled by one of our staf,

ndeavored to open up the Israeli account to a better relation-

ship with our ot! activitics., We debated this
over many months and on several occasions. We could never
really agree to it because he insisted on the importance of
retaining it where it was.

Mr. Angleton had done a very good job of establishing that

liaison years ago and knew a lot of the senior Israeili who

were involved in it.

I believed there was inadequate coordination in the Arab

areas,
Also, I believed that there was a undue degree of compart5
mentation of that staff, that it needed more interchange wit!

our other divisions. We debated this and discussed it and i

set as my time limit for this discussion the end of December_

_ because there were some very substantial retirement benefits

that people would loose if they stayed after that point. Then
unfortunately the Seymour Hirsh article of December 22nd cane

brought Mr. Angleton up and said that I was going to make two

chose-to retire. I insisted that I talk to him before the
Seymour Hirs~ article appeared.. I knew it was coming. I
didn't know what ie was going to say. I wanted to make clear
between him-and me that the decision was based upon our long~
standing discussion of how to run that particular activity.

The question then came up who would be his successor and
Mr. Rocca was His Deputy. ‘There were two other officers who
were possibilities. One of the officers, Mr. Hood, had said
in early Decenber that he planned to retire at the end of

December. The other two, Mr. Rocca and Hr. Miler, were informe

us on a consultant basis over the next several months to help

have done so.
Chairman Church. Well, without getting off the track, I

just have one further question here in connection with Mr.

Angleton himself.

Is it txne that he is still being paid as a consultant?

Mr. Colby. I believe it has dropped off,. Mr. Chaixman.

We Jhad our photographie experts and analysts and so forth

look at these two individuals here who ware picked up. We

examined tham in “Considerable detail, and talking about the

"61 Hunt photograph, comparing St with this, and this is tho

photograph, Newsweek photegraph. You will see that there is a

lot of sortog fundenental differences in the kinds of

appearances they have, different characteristics of the
individuals.
With respect to Sturgis, ef course, we are not as confi-
dent because we don't have as good a base to work from in our
comparison but at the same time we see differences there also.
Now, wa further looked, had one of our disguise people --
we obviously have people who can disguise you --+"the rea wig
eipisode.. It wasn't red, they insist, it wasn't ill fitting:

That is the thing thet chey got upsetcdbout. But thay say thet

it would not be feasible to have them actually in a disguiss,

have these individuals actually in this disguises, that it is
too big’ a jump, it differs.

Senator Huddleston. How about the size of the in@ividual
are they pretty close?

Mx. Colby. These two are. He looks like a shorter man
from the surroundings. And Hunt is about medium height, ratho
than this short.

woww Mie atu UL andtySis and they really
were able to do a pretty good job on Hunt and, what they do is
identify certain key points, make measurements and put adjust-
ments, the same thing we do for the satellite photography in
terms of these measurements, and things like that, and compare
it in that sense, and their conclusion: is that clearly. this is
not Hunt, They are absolutely confident that this photograph
is not. Hunt. They are less confident that it is not Sturgis
because of the base on which they are operating, but they thin
it is not.

I point out that this analysis was done overnight, about
3 o'clock in the morning. This is Sturgis.

Mr. Schwarz. And to the right?:

Mr. Colby. This is a newspaper photograph of Hunt; a
recent one. These are sort of Agency photographs of him when
he was an employee.

Senator Hart Of Colorado. Were those men ever identifica
by the Dallas Police?

- Mz. Colby. They must have booked them or something if
they carricd them in. I really don't know. If they took them
in I would assume they would have had to book them.

sust one additional matter.

Chairman Church. Just one thing I would like to say to
you, Mr. Colby, before I forget it. You have made reference
to the Israali account and the special way that it had been

handled under Mr. Angleton. Before we finish our review with
you of covert operations we would like to have a more detaiisd
statement of that matter.

Mr. Colby. Right.

+ chairman Church. And I think you should prepara to
discuss it with us and we will have further questions to ask
you in connection with it.

I just wanted to give you notice.

Mr. Colby. Right. In our lexicon it doesn’t count as a

covert action but that is all sight, no problem, I wilt cover

it. : | :

investigation?

Mr. Colby. Sure, no problem.

The only other one thing I would like to suggest for tho

attempts made against Mr. Castro, in no way justifying them.
My position on this is quite clear. I do think it important

to put that exercise in the context of the times, which was

the.times of the: Bay of Pigs, which was a decision made py
the Government, The Cuban missile crisis, and following that,
a program approved by our normal covert action approval mecha-
nism to try to generate an overthrow of Mr. Castro from within
Cuba by assisting various groups to go in with sabatage and

by putting economic pressure on the country, and so forth.

That went on for a number of years after the 1961-62 episodes

and toward Mr. Castro that is an important factor in evaluat-

ing the thing, without in any way justifying the particular

attempts to assassinate him.

Senator Hart of Michigan. But was there any evaluation

get going. thereafter, however, a number OF programs weie
conducted, which I am sure the Committse might want a general
summary of. I am just giving you one sort of a paragraph
summary of it, which were aimed at’ putting economic pressure
on cuba in the hopes that this would put pressure against him
and lead to its disorder and problems there and, secondly, te
encourage revolutions, sabotage and so forth, from within
Cuba through a variety of programs of propaganda, support of
exile movements, landing of teams on the coast, things of this
nature.

Chairmen Church. The difficult with this is, as I see it

in assassination attempts the disease spreads. Your own
testimony shows it spread at least as far as the Dominican
Republic and we are going to get into closer guestions on

other matters such as Lmumba and Chile.

So that I-don't think this issue can be confined really *

to the emergency that did in fact exist between the US and

cuba and the seriousness of that emergency at the time.

Mr. Colby. I agree with you, Hr. Chairman. I am against

: Mr. Colby. I do have a copy of it. The understanding
we hava had with the other agencies is that each of us gives
our own material but we refer to the other agency for any

documents belonging to the other agency.

Chairman Church. Well, it is very difficult for the

Coumittee to operate thet way. I think that since the Commit
is-entitled to this information, that when it is pertinent
and as we proceed in our hearings from ona subject to another,
we ooght’ td be able to secure the information without having
to go back through executive channels.

Mr. Colby. May I undertake to get the permission to give
it to you? ZI will undertake to do this today. ,

Chairman Church. Any observations that the Comnittes
wishes to make on this hind of a problem?

Senator Hart of Colorado, Is this the understanding we
have had or not?

Mr. Schwarz. qe has been 2 total frustration to the staff
and I am very happy it has come up here because wa get chased
around ths corner by one agency to another. It is called the
"third agency rule." It was intended to have nothing to do

with Congressional hearings. Obviously, it had to do with

declassificaticn to the public, and it. has happened to complete bt

delay our ability to get information bacause we go at one agency
and then they determine that it really isn't their document
or it mentioned some other agency,. and then we have to go to
the other agency... .

This is an example of how frustrating it is.

Senator Mondale. Have we tried to gat this document fron
tha NSA?

Mr. Colby. No; this particular document had just come up
on) Wednesday --

Senator Schweiker. Does the counsel have any suggestions

+

as to what he feels the Committees position should be in this
area to enable him and staff to do an effective job?

Mr, Schwarz. I think the Committee's position ought to be

that pertinent information should be produced by any agency

that possesses it, and if they wish to inform another agency

that thav are @ning it, then that is their business. But I

apparently this was a Meeting at which MeNamara and Rusk were
Present, and apparently McCons Wes present, so we hed all of

to putting it in writing. :

Chaixman Church. AlLll we know is the subject of assassina-—

- Mr. Colby. Mr. Chairman, as one of the agencies involved,
if I could offar one explanation for the chira Agency Rule
even in this ‘circumstance. And I.am particularly interested in
this because sometimes our documents have material whose

sensitivity is not apparent on the face and we assume that this

will be handled in certain compartmented channels, and if it

gets out of the compartment it might give problems that the

individual at the other end wasn't aware of. That is the
basis for the rule. The thought being go back and ask the
originator, and he has a@ feeling for that and could make the
particular casa if something particularly sensitive is involved
Chairman Church. 1 woula suggest, Mr. Colby, without
binding the Committee to a precedent, with respect to dealing
with the Third Party Rule, that in this case you undertake
to secure from the NSA --
Mr. Colby. I will.

Chairman Church. -- its permission to turn this particular

document over to the Committes so it may be made a part of thesd

hearings.
Mr. Colby. I will endeavor to do that today, Mr. Chairman

Mr. Colby. I have another copy of it.

Senator Mondale. It refers to a meeting in Mr. Rusk's

"I called Lansdale's office and in his absence points@-

to Frank Head the inadmissibility and stupidity of putting this

typs of comment in writing in a document. The words he obj
to were including liquidation of leaders, Y advised him as

if he wants someone assassinated, I think that is common Sens

That ‘ts why I think these documents are so crucial,

Chairman Church, O£ course they are crucial and we must
have them,

The ambiguity, however, that we have yet to clear up is
in the third Paragraph, Senator Mondale, where the Memorandum
reads the question of assassination, particularly of Pidex———_
Castro, was brought up by Secretary McNamara at a meeting of
the special group augmanted in Secretary Rusk's offica in
August. ‘Tt was the obvious consensus at that meeting, in

answer to a comment by Mr, Eq Murrow, that this is not a subject

-Which has been Made a matter. of official record, the subject
being the question of assassination.

Now, that leaves us still without any documentary proof

engaged in an effort to assassinata,

Mr. Colby. During the Philippines and in Vistnam at that
time. Then he left CIA. He was a regular Air Force officer
all this time but he was assigned to CIA for the time he was
in the Philippines and the time he was in Vietnan. Ha then
reverted to the Air Force and was an Assistant to the Secretary
of Defense untia about 1964 or 1965. Then he went. out to

working for CIA. We wera associated with him but he was not

Mr. Colby. It was Assistant to the Secretary of Deferse.
Ican't tell you exactly what the job was entitled but
he was active in the Secretary of Defensa's participation in

12:

The reason it was addressed to William E. Colby is we

were going through that period in the middle of 1973 where t

was technically, IT guess, Director of Operations but had be
nominated to bacoms Director. This was the kind of -thing that
normally would be addressed to the Director but we had an
Acting Director, General Waltars, but it was pretty clear I
was responsibla for making the machinery ran and we had a lot
of things around the Agency addressed to me and signed by ne.

I believe this follows a conversation I had with a Mr,
Walter Eldar, who was an Assistant to Mr. John MeCone -- he
was Executive Assistant when he.was Director -- I think Hr.
Elder told me that there were certain things that he knew of
in the background that related to this effort of identifying
various questionable activities of the Agency, and I asked
him to go write them down so we could get them into the
Inspector Ganeral's report.

Senator Huddleston. The only question I raise, I don't
want to get off into the contsnts of a particular memorandum ,
but the context with the area you ware pursuing, just whether
or not standard operating procedure would require at times
there be a deliberate avoidance by certain people in the
Agency of facts and whether or not there is a great body of
decisions that are made and implemented without anything written

of it?

Mr. Colby. Well, I think that you certainly can say that
there is an avoidance by a lot of people of learning things
that they are not authorized to know. Iomean the more loyal
in a sense of our employees, say that they have authority to
know what it ‘going on in, say, Cuba, they don't have a right
to know what is going on in, say, China, and they rather
carefully keep themselves from learning what is going on in
China. I think that is a prevalence.

I think the question you are asking, however, is whether
we are trying to keep activities off of paper and it is pratty
clear that.the assassination story was essentially kept ort
the paper

and I would think that is about the only one. No, the
drug thing. I assune some of that was kept off of paper?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yas.

Mr. Colby. fhe lesson that I’ have frequently given to
my colleagues in “the bureaucracy is that however hard you try
to keep it off of paper, you will not succeed in a buregaucracy,
somebody will write it down and, therefore, it is a totally
feckless exercise to pretend that you can keep it sacret by
not writing it down. But the fact is there were situations
in which a conscious effort was made in the past to keep things
off the record,

Senator Huddleston. . To sum up, you, as Director, with the

exception of individual names for which there would be no”

to the Director.
Was McCone an employea or related with the CIA at that

Mr. Colby. “No, he left in 1965.
Senator Mondale. - So this was a memorandum from a person

no longer with the CIA,’as former Director to the current

Director, which begins “no memorandum can ke located covering
the August, '62 meeting." ,

That is the ong that earlier says the question of
assassination was discussed. However, it is highly probable
that one exists.

Now, I would like all documentation, records, and notes

This exercise stunmed from the revelation in Jack

Anderson's columis, I belisve, of our relatisnship with the

i. aot
Nafia Figures at that time. This then generated the request h

to Mr. Breckinridge to do an Inspector General's Yeport of

this whole subject, which he did, and /which we vill ce ortainly

make available to this Comnittes

In the course of it, and with the publicity, Mr. McCone,
who does maintain an occasional contact with the Agency, he
is a friend of it and an ex-Diractor ~~ I see him every now
and again and try to sort of keep him up with what is going

on in general terms without getting into political or sensitive

Matters or anything ~- but ‘he does maintain this contact and

with the Agency about the Jack Anderson column, and that then
generated this particular memorandum.
Senator Mondale. And there was an Inspector General's

Can you tell this Committee whether, to your knovledge,
documents have been destroyed?
Mr. Breckinridge. I think we can talk in terms of what
we know is there.
On the Castro assassination, the involvement with thet
aa
Mafia, there were a few memoranda in the Office of Security,

and I think you. have copies of thase.

On the second phase of that, there are practically no
records at all and our investigation at that time was mads
entirely on interviews.

there was no attention on the part of the people who were

involved at that time that that would ba an assassination in

I will go back to the Cubella case.

. In the instance of the Dominican Republic, the record
was very full then-and it is still very full today. TI am
certain that record is complete.

Again, in the minds of the people who were involved, they
drew a line between the support they gave to the coup group
and conscious association with assassination as such. Those
records are complete and those records were developed at the
tims and they were retained. It was in the period of the

Mafia was involved where psople knew the purpose was assassina~

tion.

The records: are practically non-existent and I believe
they never existed.

Narvey, who conducted the second phase of that, at the
time of our investigation had a handful of eryptic notes that

only he could interpret. Wa couldn't interpret ther. And

it is my understanding that those notes no longer exist. TI
were retgined by him and he brought them in at the time that

we ware questioning him. He was then on sick leave prior to

retiromant. Those notes ware totally unrevealing.

that they ware then.
There were none in the Castro affair except the re
of our investigation involving the Mefia.

aman as nesting with Cubella in Paris, and in response to
Cubella's request offered him an assassination davica that at
the time of the investigation we understood he accepted but

I have since been told he did not accept. It was a ballpoint
pen converted into a syringe for injecting poison.

Subsequently, arms were handed to Cubsella by a Cuban
vefugea in Madrid, in the very early part of 1965, and two.
catches were put down by boats off Cuba for Cubella. I think
he may have recovered one of those but not the other. The
records on that are prety complete,

So, generally épeaking, on those things where the Agency
was involved, with the exception of the association with the

I think some propoganda programs were kept up, some exile

My guess, as I say, is that if John MNcCone didn't know
about it, it was not covered in those discussions because it
would be very hard to cover them without his being involved.

thixa member of the syndicate involved in this, both pe whom
were high on the FBI list, as they progressed towards developing
a p¥osecution, they came to Colonel Edwards, the FBI did, and
said what is your position on this. The position of the Agency
as stated by Colonel Edwards was we did not want them prosecuted
because it would expose what he understood to be this operation,
and ‘I guess the time sequence gets a little Every in my mina.
Mr. Schwarz. Did he tell the Director of the FBI the

nature of the operation, or simply he told him it would concern

some sensitive matter?

Mr. Breckinridge. He told him it was an intelligence
operation in country, and the Mafia was being used for that
Purpose. So in the discussions as it progressed, it dealt with
the wiretap prosecution. Colonel Edwards in discussing it
with us in 1967, according to our notes, said that they briefed
the Attorney General all the way, but at that time Colonel
Edwards, I think by the time they did it, Colonel Edwards thought
it was over. So the At -torney General and the FBI were not told
the cOmplete story.

Mr. Schwarz. They weren't told the most important part
of the story, and that was that it was continuing.

Mr. Breckinridge. They didn't know that, that is correct.

Chairman Church. So you have here two violations of law.
Apart from what was told to ‘the Attorney General, you have two

violations of law, Onc, the wiretap, it was an illegal operation

view, I have a record that shows what the project was supposed
to have been as far as its open description, though classified,
and the.result of our interviews. with Mr. Harvey which tell the
other story about executive action capability. So it does not,
the record does not show that Mr.Helms at that time knew what
that was.

Chairman Church. If Harvey knew that it had this other
aspect, who would have told him to develop such a capability, if
it were not his superior?

Mr, Breckinridge. I think that. is a logical. conclusion, bus

Iwas distinguishing what the record showed and what our inter

developed.

Chairman Church. Didn't you ask Harvey in interviewing

him whether or not Helms had told him to develop this capability
as a part of the 2R Rifle? ,
Didn't, you ask him who told/him to Gevelop this capability,
or did he do it on his own? ,
Max. Breckinridge. Your question is a very proper one, and

my difficulty ds with the record which goes back to what Bissel

instructed Harvey to do.

“Mr. Breckinridge. Bissel told Harvey to create the execut;
action capability.

Mr. Schwarz. But he also told him to take charge of the
Castro assassination project using the Mafia; isn't that
correct?

Mr. Breckinridge. Nov, there is no record except the
record that camé from our interviews on this score. All I
am trying to do is draw the distinction between what the record
shows and what our interviews: developed, and there are gaps
in that. .

Chairman Church. Your interviews show that Mr. Bissel, who
preceded Helms, told Mr. Harvey to develop an executive action
capability, which was a capability’ to assassinate if.and when
ordered; right?

Mr. Breckinridge. That is correct.

Chairman Church. And your records show that Mr. Bisse
also Anstructed Harvey to take over the Castro assassination
attempt, which was connected with a continuing relationship
between the CIA and the Mafia?

Mr. Breckinridge. JI think that is a correct assumption, -

and in conversation with Rselli~ Roselli was the man who was
in the Mafia through whom the Agency had continued to work +=
and Roselli agreed that nothing was happening, nothing could
happen, and it should be called off. We don't have a record
that Harvey went anywhere for approval. This doesn't mean that
he may not have discussed it, but I don't have the record of it.
So Harvey in his conversation with Roselli, terminated the

Mr. Breckinfidge. I don't know,

Chaicman Church. ALL right, after Harvey left the country
who was then assigned to undertake the subsequent efforts again
the life of Castro?

Mr. Breckinridge. This brings us to Senator Schweiker's
question. A man n by the name of Orlando Cubella, who had been
met in Mexico City by the Agency in 1961, who had been one of
the leaders of the anti-Ratista coups ; and held the rank of Major
in the Cuban’ army, that is the highest rank they have, Cubelia
was an M.D. and had been a youth leader and attended youth

conferences around the world, and was met first in Mexico City,

and later he was met in Scandinavia on several occasions, And

Cubella's desire to have a change in Cuba, and the atterct on
the Agency people who met with hin to explore his ability to

substituté a. covernment as well as be able to overthrow th:

existing government.

These conversations were very general, exploratory, ana
nhon-productive,

In one of the early meetings with Cubella, he taiked about
eliminating Castro, and the’ Agency employee used the word
assassination, which was reported back as being an offensiva

word to Cubella,-and instructions were issued ‘that Cubella was

be in Octeber of 1963,

“Mr. Colby. I think at that time he was either head of the
Cuban forse or Chief of the Weste.n Hemisphere Division.

Chairman Church, Will you get that for the record?

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir,

Mr. Breckinridge. The decision was taken to try and give
Cubella some instrument, A ball point pen was designed that
could be used as ‘a Syringe. Because Cubella was a eeoctor, the
pen was given to him in Paris on the 22nd of Novenber, 1963,
with the suggestion that he use it. ,

Chairman Church, By whom was the pen given?

Mr. Breckinridge. It. was given by a case officer of the

Agency. In fact, Cubella refused to take it. When we wrote our

report, we thought he accepted it, but I've since lea
refused it. He said it was not practical,

Because he was a doctor it was Suggested that he could
acquize the material to put in the pon, but he refused to accept

it.

Conversations continued, ane finally the. Agency arvanged
to put down two caches at Sea off the coast of Cuba, one of
which had weapons in it, one of which had just general equipment.

Senator Schweiker. Did that come later, Colonel Prouty?

Mr. Knoche. Prouty's allegations go back to 1959,

Senator Schweiker, What?

Mr, Knoche, 1959, late 1959 and early 1960.

Mr, Breckinridge. We arranged to have a Cuban refugee
leader meet Cubella in Spain, at which time he gave him an
additional weapon, That would have been in February oz 1964,

I think, 4

Chairman Church, what kind of weapon was given to him?

. Mr. Breckinridge. It is my recollection it was a rifle,
I am not Sure of that. _

Cubella continued to have conversations and meetings from
time to time as he came out of Cuba, and finally. in the middie
of 1965 the decision was taken to cut off contact with him |
because there were serious questions about the security of his
organization.

Ne was arrested, I think. I think I have gotten my dates
right. It is subject to correction. He was arrested in the
early part of 1966 and tried, made a confession, had a public
trial, which was reported in the press, .

explain how it was during this period that Cubella was able
to return to Cuba and travel to Europe,
. I assume he was able to return to Cuba?
Mr. Colby, He was a Cuban officer at that time, and

apparently loyal to Castro. fle would go out on various trips

and things like that, and we would meet him there.

Mr. Schwarz. He was the man who met with Mr. Hunt in

Madrid?

Mr. Colby. ‘He met with a friend of Mr. Hunt. A Cuban ex
met Cubella-in Madrid. That is when the weapons were handed
over,

Hr, Schwarz.- Was Mr. Hunt in Madrid at that tine?

Mr. Colby. Yes, .

Mr. Breckinridge, No, because this man by the name of
Artimo, met Cubella in Madrid in December of 1964, and in
February 1965 he made ‘the Gelivery of the weapons. Hunt was
not assigned there until the middle of 1965, after this was
over. We,don't know where that story came from.

Ur. Colby. Hunt and Artimo are very close, and he is the
godfather of one of their children, and things like that. He
may Rave told him about it.

goes to a point when Senator Schweiker was asking the question
at the last time, This is the last instance that we know of
in which assassination was involved,

Senator Schweiker. That is, both your records and your
interviews indicate that this was the last known activity,

Mr. Breckinridge. That was specifically related to
Castro; o. ‘

The point at which they began to provide weapons to hin
should have required higher level approval. I don't know whak
the level of approval was. :

Mr. Schwarz. It should have under the normal procedures?

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes, sir. *

Chairman Church. At one point a meeting tcok place and an
agent of the CIA gave him a ballpoint pen that hadq been speciali
designed to camouflage a syringe, and gave it to him with the
recommendation that it would be filled with poison and used to
kill Castro.

To agree with you, he should have known ebout it, but I

Senator Morgan. I won't ask any other quastions except
for tha racord I would like to sey this so I can remember why
Iwas pursuing this later on.

I asked these questions not to try tc show the assessing

plan, beacause I think that has already been established, and

if that is all we ars after wa can move on to some ing else.

But

thing that does concern me is thet if this proince

continued on until end past the tims thet Przsie

whether or not Castro hinself may not well have known about it

sther or not the President's essassination may not have

ena part of a recrimination plan and it may just opan the

ther or not later on we should decide to look into

that.

That is the reason I have followed that line of quastions.

; Photocopy from ‘
Chairman Church. Senator Hart. Gerald Ford Library

Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Colby, in connection with

ZR Rifle, I think you testified or your associate said this was

a multi-purpose operation, including stealing codes, and the
development of the capability of what euphemistically is called |
executive action. '
In your professional judgment, and with your history of
your background in the Agency, does it make any sense to you that
a major operation; a major intelligence gathering operation of
the sort of, stealing codes, whieh: 1 assume means fromvother
governments, would be mounted under the direction of a man
about whom all I know is that Mr. Harvey has a background of

something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,

I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?

Does it not suggest to you

operation with unlimited, non-vouther financial capability?

Mr. Colby. No, not that it is purely a cover.

hn the first place, Mr. Harvey had a very successful tour
in Bexhkin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which was
one of our major successful intelligence operations.

Mr. Harvey was a very Colorful figure who had his lifastyle;

which is different than some others, but he had been very

effective at that, and very adventuresome in that category of

sighals intelligence and a very .enturesome idea of at nature «

That stafe's. -major function is to conduct the signals Antelligen:

work vhich rust be done in the clandestine service.

It hindles our efforts today to penetrate into foreign
code rooms abroad, and things of that nature, and it involves
the breaking into of safes and things, all that complicated

material.

Now, the thing that puts it together with this "capability";

executive action, is the high degree of compartmentation of
this materia}, that kind of a project. In other words, a
code~breaking, a stealing operation, obviously that is. to be
kept very, “very sécret., If you get caught in it, it has all
sorts of very bad diplomatic implications, and so forth.
Therefore, there is a system of very sharp compartmentation of
the work of that particular group.

You also are dealing with some very venturesome people

who are willing to crawl into somebo sets ‘tode room and

take the ehance of getting caught.

, Sa, given you have a man who had some good technical
experience, who is a venturesome type himself and is running a
program which is not too far off the requirements of high

conpartmentation, and a very high risk kind of operation, and

as well as this other activity.

Now, ‘in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the secona
one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been
discussing. It was not to be put on the record although to be
done. That ig a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,
but to say that the»code Stealing vas only a cover I think is
probably an unwarranted conclusion.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding
of $7,506 to $10,000?

Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of
an operation.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Precisely. I think it is too
little,

Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is

largely a staff operation. In other words, you use your own

think you can draw much conclusion from the actual number on
the figure one way or the other.

this might net have been the only such project. You know,
an assassination project would cost you more money than that,
too. , :

Senator Hart of Colorado, So Nr. Harvey, Lf the decision
were made to try to liquidate a foreign leader, and Mr. Ra ivey
found the instrumentality, the individual to do that, and that
required $100,000, all he had to do was come back in and say?

Mr, Colby. He could get it.

Mr. Schwarz. I think we should have the record reflect
two things. The two gentlemen talking are not eyewitnesses to
what we have, been talking about.

second, and related to that, for us to pursue this matter,
we must have, and'must have right ‘away, the better evidence
which is in the possession of the CIA, which is at least the
Inspector General report of 1967; and more importantly than that,
the interview notes reflecting whatever interviews you had

Mr. Colby. Sure, If we can just have the same sort of

normal ground rules..about the papers.

Chairman Church, Sure. They always apply unless -- =

Mr. Colby. I know,

Chairman Church. -- unless we say differently.

Mr. Schwarz, No, just following up one more thing on
Senator Hart's question of some time ago.

Would you determine with respect to five different periods

of time whether, first, there was any internal evaluation

within the Central Intelligence Agency as to whether or nor

the assassination attempts should continue and, second, whether
there was any discussions with persons outside of the Central
Intelligence Agency as to whether or not the plot should continud
and the period of tine would be the initial authorization, which
was March 1960, after the Bay of Pigs, during the missile
crisis, And, parenthetically there, will you state whether it
}was possible Castro might have been assassinated pursuant to

an ongoing plan during a period of time when the United States

and Russia were close to a nuclear éonfrontation, The nex

case is Johan F.Kennedy's assassination.

Finally, at the time of the break-off in June of 1965).

Because that will bear upon whether anybody in higher authority

Mr, Schwarz. Can I pick up then on another subject wich
we just barely touched on last time, Mr. Colby?

| This is related to the question I asked you about the use
of criminal elements,

Senator Mathias. Before we leave this, I have one questien,.

Chairman Church. Senator Mathias.

Senator Mathias, In light of the fact this poison pen was
actually proffered on the 22nd of November, 1963, is there a
scintilla of evidénce -- and was proffered to a Major in the
Cuban Army on active duty -- is there a scintilla of evidence
that anyone in the Cuban Government had any knowledge or suspicic:

prior to that date that this was a project that was planned?

Mr. Colby. There is certainly no evidence that anyone
had that information with respect to the Cubella operation.
“ur. areckinridge. No.
Mr. Colby. The second phase of the Mafia operation had bee
wrapped up by then, think.
Mr. Breckinridge. Yes.

Mr. Breckinridge. Yes. There were people who reportedly
were mnt ‘inte Cuba, a team of three people -- and I Said reportac
because we were working then through a Cuban exile leader,

They had the assignment of recruiting additional peapte to
carry out such plans as might be devclopad. We newer knew what
happened to those people ~~ whether . they came back -- only that
they were sent in.

But if you are looking for a possibility of knowledge of
an assassination Plot, conceivably those three peovle could be
the source of it, but not that the United States Government was
behind it.

Senator Mathias. But it is conceivable that Castro and
his government could have come upon some evidence that some
plot was afoot?

Mr. Colby. He certainly could have cross allegations,

you really must assume that various of the other kind, even

independent activities, or the first phase of the Mafia prog:

the comment that CIA or the United States was hehind it. ‘he
possibility of that kind of allegation is just almost infinite.

Senator Mathias. Particularly considering the nature of

the instruments that were being deployed?

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.

Mr. Breckinridge. There is another consideration.

The Cuban exile community in Miami was engaged in a great

it is safe to assume that Castro also had reports of assassinati

Mr. Schwarz. I would like to pick up on the discussion
we had.

Chairman Church. Mr. Schwarz has five minutes more, and
we will conclude, and I vould lik. to ask the Committee ec Stay
on for ten more minutes for an exécutive session,

Mr. Schwarz. In the discussion we had on the use of
criminal elements, we have dealt with the Castro operation.

In the middle of the book supplied to us by Mr, Breckinridge
earlier this week, there is a discussion about the Lumumbo__]
operation, and the Agent Q. J. Win, ——}

Now, is’ it a fact that Q. J. Win was the agent, or asset,
however’ you would refer to hin, who apparently was considered
for the effert to assassinate Lumurba, which never took place;

is that right?

. Mx. Colby. Yes, sir.

Mx Schwarz, Now, is it accurate that Q. J. Win operated
in. Europe trying to spot and assess individuals whom the Agency
could. use in safecracking operations?

Mr. Colby. This is what is reported, and it is quite
possible. :
cS

Mr. Breckinridge. The record indicates that.

Nr. Schwarz. And is it further so that one of the CIA
efficers who first met Q. J. win in Luxembourg, wag on a-

trip overseas to find safe¢rackers and Gocument suppliers?

Me. Colby. Yes, that is what it Says. ¢

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir. , ,

Mr. Schwarz. ts it correct that "Lucky" Luciano was used
to help the OSS in connection with operatiens in Italy during
the Second World ar? ,

Mr. Colby. zt don't know, but I have heard that story
as well, It is an extensive story but I don't know the facts.

Mr. Schwarz. -For the record, Mr. Luciano was a Mafia
figure who had been deported from the United States, or was in
jail jin the united states?

Mr. Colby. Was in jail, I guess, and was later deported
after the War.

Mr. Schwarz, Is it the fact that, for example, between

the Washington Police Department in the subject of Surreptitio:s;
entry?

Mr. Colby. %t was included in that, yes.

Mr. Schwarz, What was the purpose of conducting such a
course?

Mr, Colby. We had a relationship with various police

departments around the country. They from time to time would

like to learn our knowledge of certain subjects that are quite

unique to’ the CIA. There are a number of things that we

to do in CIA which are quite frankly outside the norm of mest

~ ur. Colby. Presumably, yes.
Chairman Church, Why is CIA conducting courses teaching
local police illegal activity, hes to conduct illegal Ops.ations?
Mr. colby. x think at that time, Mr. Chairman, that was
at the request of the police department of that area, that they
were interested in this thing, and there is a defensivo element

of it. In order to know how to protect against something, it

is well to know how it is actually conducted.

Chairman Church. Do you construe this activity to be

within the law, the basic statute which restricts your domestic

activities?

ir. Colby. I don't think it is a violation of the law,
Vix. Chairman.
H I did give some directive on that in 1973, that we not

engage in this anymore, in compliance with the spirit of the

Act, sshich says that CIA will not provide support to the LEAA
in its assistance to local police departments. And as far as
I was concerned, that is a policy that they don't want CIA in
touch with local police departments.

The fact of sharing our knowledge of techniques with a

local police department does not in my mind get us into actually

Chairman Church. Yes, Sut apart from the technical
question of your jurisdiction, when you engage in teaching local
police departments how to conduct break-ins, surreptitious
break-ins, you are teaching them how to break the law.

Mr. Colby. You are teaching them how the law is broken.

-Chairman Church. That is right. - .

Mr. Colby. Which can be useful to them in their knowledge

ef how the law is broken, the techniques that are feasible. i

Chairman Church. Or can be useful to them in knowing how j
to break the law?
“ur, Colby. It could, It is an item of information that
they can use in ahy way they wish, either properly or improperly.
Mr. Schwarz. Are you aware of any situations where govern-!
mental officials, either state, local or Federal, have in fact

engaged in break-ins within the United States? i

Mr. Colby. I know of certain situations related to foreign!
intelligence operations where access to appropriate targets has ;
been obtained either through subterfuge of pretending to be a {
‘workman or something of that nature, and I think in that history!
there are some cases of actual break-ins.

Now, I assure you, Mr. Chairman, we have been conducting i

break-ins abroad. ‘There is no question about that. That is,

we train our people to be able to do that.
