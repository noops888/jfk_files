PHASE I (CIA)

ACTIVITY

INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS

1. * Dispatch one intelligence

agent operation to key area

selected by CIA.

1 • 15 March 1962

PURPOSE

CONSIDERATIONS

Collect and report intelligence on anti-

regime attitudes, on potential resist-

ance, and on vulnerabilities and

strengths of Communist security

There is a risk that this action will disclose this U.S.

intelligence activity within Cuba. Selected personnel

are being intensively trained.

This first team has 2

agents. An area in which resistance has been reported

has been selected. Agent operations must stay alive,

make useful contacts, and report securely to CIA.

pected to start in April.

Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trainec

for paramilitary skills as well as intelligence collection

with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba

and ready to act whenever paramilitary operations are

decided upon. However, CLA has noted that, once the

agents are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled

ffectively from outside Cuba, although every effor

will be made to attempt such control

ACTIVITY

4. * Caribbean Admission Center,

Opa-Locka, Florida, fully

activated by 15 March 1962.

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence required for the

operations, to identify and earmark in

telligence assets as refugees arrive,

and to provide security against Com-

munist agent operations.

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendati on

as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at

utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with

a new building completed and occupied, and with a

staff of 43 at work. Operations commenced 15 February

and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.

(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,

State, USIA.)

5. * Periodic intelligence enti-

mates, as required by progress

of operations.

To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current

estimates can be considered at national

policy levels.

11. * Develop additional interroga-

31 March 1962.

To collect intelligence in a Latin

atmosphere, at different levels thai.

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose

of recruitment, nature of training,

and policy decisions

controlling these factors. If the recruitment and train

ing are for resistance activities, the tack of recruit

ment and training will be much less difficult than if

they are limited to intelligence-collection purposes

only.

There are "colonies" in Washington, D.C., and other

U.S. cities which are "little Cubas." Family, Church,

and business interests provoke unusual personal ties

inside Cuba for some of these residente; a real potential

exista for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-

able. (FBI support and coordination is basic in this

effort.)

As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CIA will activate

other interrogation centere as promptly as feasible CA

Negotiations wit

local authorities are being undertaken to activate centers,

San

uan, Puerto Rico

are being sur

veyed for possible centers.

port by others as necessary.)
