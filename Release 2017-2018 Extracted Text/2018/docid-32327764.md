POLLACK resided in Monticello, NY, throughout
his childhood and adult life until about 1954 when

he moved to Hempstead, Long Island, At. this time

he became publisher of the Statewide Publishing Company;
Inc.,,; which was engaged in organizing and printing

an annual building trades magazine, In July, 1957,
POLLACK was experiencing some minor financial difficulty
in this business venture and at this time was

approached »y one JOE INA and was asked by GENNA

to meet two individudls in the bar at the Waldorf
Astoria Hotel, NYC, for the purpose of discussing

a business transaction, He advised that he met these
individuals who introduced themselves as being SALLY
BURNS and GEORGE LEVINE, He had never met these individuals
before and at the time of the meeting had no indication

as to their background or pussnese enterprises,

BURNS and LEVINE requested POLLACK to cooperate
with them in setting up a Ready-Mix Cement business
in Havana, Cuba, Their suggestion was that POLLACK
"front" the enterprise, which they indicated would
necessarily be successful dice to political connections
which these individuals had in Havana, POLLACK stated
this venture did not ultimately materialize due to
difficulties which arose in obtaining a second hand
ready-mix plant from the United States; However, ‘during
the time plans were béing made for setting up this business,
n POLLACK made three trips to Cuba between sulys 1957
and November 1, 1957.

POLLACK advised that he made each trip
with GENNA, and that on each occasion they conferred

with GEORGE LEVINE, who at that time resided at the
Hotel Rosita de Horanodo in Havana. On the first

trip LEVINE took them to a proposed plant site and
assured them that they would have no difficulty obtaining
an option on this land or any probiems during the setting
up stages of the plant duc to his excellent connections
in the Cuban Government; on ‘tet POLLACK believed to be
the second trip, LEVINE, GENNA and POLLACK arranged

for corporation papers to be drawn up in order-that

the business could be inetituted when they were able

to obtain the necessary equipment in the United States.
LEVINE assured them that he and SALLY BURNS would
guarantee contracts from the Cuban Government which
would insure a profitable operations They expected

50% of the proceeds of the operation for the use of
their influence in establishing thi business, However,

While in Havana on these three ‘trips,
POLLACK accompanied LEVINE to various gambling casinos.
in Havana and to the Oriente Race Track near Havana,
which LEVINE told POLLACK he and BURNS ‘owned, POLLACK
remarked’ that the horse races at the track did not
seem to be set up with the idea of a large profit being
made on the racing'end of the pusiness, inasmuch as
most of the races involved-only a $50 or $100 purse,
Instead, LEVINE indicated that they made their money
from two gambling casinos, which they operated at |
the track site. During his visits to various Havana
casinos, POLLACK advised that he met a large number
of individuals who appeared to be connected with these
casinos, whom LEVINE appeared to know very well,

NY 92-632

POLLACK mentioned that LEVINE introduced
him to an individual identified only as LEFTY CLARK, who
was a pit boss in one of the casinos, It is :
noted that this individual is probably identical
with WILLIAM BISCHOFF, with alias LEFTY CLARK, Miami
top hoodJum,. In addition to LEFTY CLARK, POLLACK
agvised that he met MEYBRXTANSKY and SANTOS

FICANTE, who was: introduced as Mr, SANTOS,

T Cuba. a

Cubs. According to POLLAGK, on the last day
of His most recent stay in Havana with LEVINE, POLLACK
remarked that he and GENNA were waiting downstairs at
the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo for LEVINE planned
to leave for the United States with t by air,
According to POLLACK, when LEVINE failed to appear
in the hotel lobby after.a consicerable wait, he
left GENYA in the lobby and went up to LEVINE's hotel
room to huxey him up. He advised that he walked
in without knocking and LEVINE seemed quite upset
about his bursting into the room in this manner.
POLLACK stated that there were approximately six
men in the room besides LEVINE, one of whom he recognized
as. the individual previously introduced to him as
Mr, SANTOS, LEVINE referred to one of the men seated
apart from the others as "JOEY A.". From subsequent
discussion with LEVINE and from observing a newspaper
photo, POLLACGK advised that the individual referred
to as JOEY A. was JOE ADONIS, well known NY
hoodlum who had been deported to Italy in 1956.

Tnasmuch as this Ready-Mix Cement deal
fell through, POLLACK indicated that he had no
further dealings with SALLY BURNS until a time which
he believed to be in January, 1958, when he became
in a serious need of money in connection with his :
business, In about January, 1958, POLLACK contacted
BURNS and received -a $5,000 loan to be repaid in six
months with $1,000 in interest, $2,000 of this loan

he

Docid: 32327764 Page 5


NY 92-632

was to be used as a deposit with che Telephone. Company
on a number of telephones installed at the Statewide
Publishing Company, Ines. BURNS stipulated that this
deposit with the T hone. Company be placed

in the naue of JO. AGLIARELLO, whom POLLACK came

to know as both J LLI and Little Joe, a close

associate of BURNS De

In about February or March, 1958, BURNS
contacted PULLACK and unexpectedly demanded that
the $5,000 2oan and interest be repaid immediately.
POLLACK told BUANS he did not have the money at
the time and would experience difficulty in obtaining
such a sum at the time, BURNS became very insistent
and threatened POLLACK with a beating if he did not

repay the money imnodiately: During the next month,
POLLACK contacted close friends and from these individuals

porrowed the $6,000 which was repaid to BURNS

in about four installments, After paying the balance
of the loan, BURNS told POLLACK that he had decided
that $4000 interest was owed on the loan in addition
to the $1,000 already paid, During the next three

or four months, POLLACK paid the additional $4,000
due to the threats and pressure exerted by EURNS.
POLLACK advised that during the time he was repaying
the loan and interest to BURNS, he was subjected

to three beatings by BURNS and two of his muselemen
identified. only as BABE and CHICK. , POLLACK said that
tno of these beatings took place in BURNS! apartment
at 215 Mott Street, and the other beating took place
in an unmarked office maintained by LEVINE and BURNS
on the 20th floor at 40 Exchange Place, nyc, He
stated he had no choice in his estimation, but to come
to the instant address when requested to do so by
BURNS,

During the course of visits to BURNS!
apartment at Mott Street, POLLACK related that he
also became acquainted with a young muscleman
referred ¢o only as HJDDY, who appearéd to be closely
connected with BURNS, From POLLACK's déseription
of this individual, he may be identical with pup’ OPPOLLA
known 59 the New York Office as being associated Abs
with GEANELLO, POLLACK added that during his visits
to Mott Street, he often met BURNS and his associates
in a small cafe located on the West Side of Mott
Street near Kenmare Street, which seemed to be a
regular hangout for BURNS and/his underlings. WY,
According jo POLLACK,.during/ygelous visits to BURNS!
apartment, he observed V. MCENOVESE in the apartment
on one occasion, an individual referred to as TOWY._

n POLLACK identified photographs. of
ANTHONY: STROLLO and JOHN ODDO as the individuals
referred to as TONY BENDER and JOHNNY BATHBEACH, respectively,
He also remarked that. on one occasion at a time when
he had $1,000 to pay BURNS on the interests BURNS
claimed to be accumulated, BURNS, during a telephone
call instructed him to drop off the $1,000 with
JOHNNY BATHBEACH at the Club 13 at Avenue U and 13th
Street, Brooklyn, New York, POLLACK continued
that when he appeared at the Club 13, ODDO introduced
him to an individual. referrred to only as MINX
or MINXIE. opDd then left the club alone with POLLACK
and directed POLLACK to a late model Cadillac automobile
parked outside the club where he actually- turned
over the $1,000 to ODDO, POLLACK advised that the
above was the extent of his contact with ODDO.

Both STROLLO and -opDO are top hoodlums of the

NYO. The individual_iatroduced as MINX or MINXIE may be
identical with JORLENOTO, Wa., MINX, 2 close associate of

ODDO.

Concerning STROLLO and GENOVESE,

POLLACK related that he once accompanied SALLY BURNS

to the Erb Strapping Company at what he believed to

be 180 Thompson Street and upon entry into this —
company's office, BURNS inquired of a receptionist
where GENOVESE was, According to POLLACK, she :
replied that Mr, GENOVESE was in conference to which
BURNS replied to the best of POLLACK's recollection

"To hell with him", and procseded directly into .
GENOVESE's office. From what POLLACK observed, GENOVESE
did not appear disturbed by this and BURNS and GENOVESE
proceeded to converse in the inner office in a friendly
manner, :

POLLACK noted that at that time GENOVESE
appeared to have been in conference with an
individual referred.to as being from New Jersey who
he believed was called "Gyp The Blood" or RAY, and
an individual referred to only as Johnny The Bug.

HY
ve Aye ‘POLLACK identified a photograph of JOHN
TOPPELLI, with allas, Johnny _The Bug_as the
““Individual referred to above. It is noted that

STOPPELLI is known to the NYO as a close associate
of STROLLO and GENOVESE,

POLLACK also advised that on one
occasion when he was told to proceed to the above-mentioned
unmarked office at 40 Exchange Place, NYC, that
he observed VITO GENOVESE leaving the office as he
entered, He advised that he had no conversation
with GENOVESE, and that GENOVESE did not. acknowledge
his presence at the time,

Another individual POLLACK advised he met

POLLACK related that a short time after he
had completed his payments to SALLY BURNS, aggregating
$10,000, that he was contacted by BURNS and instructed
to come to BURNS! apartment on a businéss matter. Upon
arrival at his apartment, BURNS explained to him that
he was taking over in interest in a New York night
club, the Cafe de Paris, at 53rd Street and Broadwey;
New York City, a club féaturing a big name ente: inment Nu f
policy. It was explained to POLLACK that LODMIALTERS,
well-known New York City night club impresaric

was in 2
financial jam in this club which he had opened, and

BURNS told POLLACK that he, POLLACK, was to assume

duties as front man in the club. According to POLLACK,
when he complained to BURNS that he had no particular
interest in entering such a venture, BURNS reportedly
instructed him in no uncertain terms that he was to

take the job that re had no choice in the matter. In
view of the physical violence inflicted on POLLACK during
previous contacts. with BURNS and his group, POLLACK
related tnat he saw no alternative but to follow BURNS!’
instructions. According to POLLACK, he served as manager
at this club for about four or five weeks until the

club folded and went into bankruptcy. During this period,
he related that SALLY BURNS contributed a total of about:
$13,000 to the operation of the club and he, POLLACK, figured
he personally contributed close to. $30,000, which he had
peen able to borrow from close friends. When asked

why he contributed his own money in a venture in which he
had no choice at the outset, POLLACK explained that once
he became connected with the club, he figured that if they
could survive the conparitively slim summer night club trade,
that he was convinced the club would be a success once the
winter season began. POLLACK noted that the club featured
such entertainers as BETTY HUTTON, JERRY LEWIS, and BOB
HOPE,

Docld: 32327764 Page 10


NY 92-632

POLLACK explained that while the club; was
in operetion, BURNS gave the indication that the
$13,000 he contributed was ds an investment in this
venture, However, when the club went into bankruptcy,
BURNS then informed POLLACK that he was »esponsitle
for the $13,000 as a personal loan from BURNS to POLLACK,
and thereafter, once again began demands on’ POLLACK
not only for tae principal $13,000, but for exhorbitant
interest on this "loan," which to date amounts to a
total of approximately $16,000, according to POLLACK,

Though ‘SURNS took no active part in
managing this club, POLIACK remarked that he wes often
there during the evening hours as were some.of his
underlings, specifically, the individuals referred to
previously as BABE, CHICK, and BUDDY.

POLLAUK also noted that a part of the $13,000
contributed by BURNS was raised in the following manner:

At a particular time when POLLACK was having
difficulty meeting the payroll, BURNS instructed him to
accompany JCE QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey, where they were
to pick up $2,500 from the RAY previously. mentioned as
having been in the office of VITO GENOVESE on Thompson
Street. POLLACK accompanied QUAGLIARELLO to New Jersey,
to a roadside: club where they met RAY who turned over
the $2,509 to QUAGLIARELLO. From POLLACK's description
of his trip to New Jersey, and the layout of this roadside
club, together with his description of RAY, a group of
photographs including that.of ANGELO DE CARLO, Newark
top hoodlum, was exhibited to POLLACK, POLLACK identified
the photograph of DE CARLO as the RAY who furnished the

" $2,500 and as the individual from New Jersey he had
previously observed in the office of GENOVESE in New York
City. POLLACK stated that this was his only contact with
DE CARLO.

The roadside club where this money was o tained
appears to be the Martinique restaurant, operated by
DE CARLO in Mountainside, New Jersey.

POLLACK stated that he was furnishing this
information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),
inasmuch as he felt that matters had reached the pant
where SALLY BURNS and associates had no interition of
leaving him alone regardless of the amount POLLACK paid
to them. He feels that BURNS now feels he has POLLACK
"hooked" and will continue to bleed him for money.

He furthee advised that BURNS intimated POLEACK will

be subjected to further beatings and suggested that
POLLACK's wife and three children might also be subject
to inconvenience and mishap if POLLACK were to be
"uncooperative." POLLACK further related that he

expects to gain a one-third in & in the Victoria
Acres Race Track at Winnepeg, Canada, within a couple

of weeks. He advised that becau e of his familiarity
with the construction business, and race track matters,
he was called upon by the prominent people backing the
track. to give them advice and assistance in developing
the track. For this, he was offered one-third of

the’ stock in the track, which stock POLLACK expects

will be issued within a couple of weeks. He advised that
the track is for trotters and that there has already been
approved by the Canadian Government. He advised the entire
track transaction is entirely legitimate, Froin a portion
of the proceeds of the stock from this track, he

expects to repay SALLY BURNS a total of $13,0@and clear
up numerous personal loans.

On September 15, 1958, the records of the

Credit Bureau of Greater New York, reflected that POLLACK
has approximately ten judgments and suits pending

in the New York City area for amounts of approximately
$200 or less with the exception of one Judgment in Nassau
County, New York, which is in the amount of $1, 559.50.
All of these judgments were filed in elther November and
December, 1957, or May, 1958. Thecredit records further

voluntary petition of bankruptcy in the Eastern District
of New York, in the name of the Nassau Advertising Agents

had $19,762 assets and $188,292 liabilities. The records
reflected POLIACK cms a home valued at $18,000 and listed
his employment as the Building Trades Council, 104

Perry Street, Trenton, New Jersey. However, the Credit
Bureau determined that POLLACK was unknown at the
Building Trades Council which is located at 151 Mercer

furnished the following information:

He explained that while ate tempting to make arrange-
ments to leave town until he. could raise the amount mentioned
above, he contacted one LEO, BLANK whom he described as a
good friend who has various interests in trotting tracks in
New York and Florida. He mentioned that BLANK was from
Liberty, N¥, and he hoped to arrange to obtain accommoda-
tions through BLANK in the vicinity of Liberty, NY, until he
could raise sufficient money to get himself out of his
difficulties with SALLY BURNS, He mentioned that if he is
successful, he will probably be out of town for from ten

other traffic equipment to various communities both in New
York and New England. He related that OSMAN, together with
others, is presently attempting to obtain a New York State
license to operate a flat racing track in the vicinity of
Rochester, NY, and that OSMAN has been making use of
‘POLLACK'S knowledge of race-track promotion in his attempts
to obtain this license and set up the track.

POLLACK advised that he was to meet OSMAN earlier
that afternoon, 9/12/58, at the Belmont Plaza Hotel in NYC
and that when he was unable to locate OSMAN in his room at
the above hotel, he located him in the restaurant in that
hotel ét a table with the individual he mentioned

It is noted that from information furnished by POLLACK
