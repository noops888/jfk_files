M.

Ny, throughout

he moved to Hempstead, Long Island. At this time

he became publisher of the Statewide Publishing Company,

Inc, which was engaged in organizing and printing

an annuas building trades magazine.

In July, 1957,

POLLACK was experiencing some minor financial difriculty

in this business venture and at this time was

approached by one JOE cHINA and was asked by GENNA

to meet two individuals in the bar at the Waldorf

Astoria Hotel, NYC, for the purpose of discussing

a business transaction. He advised that he met these

individuals who introduced themselves as being SALLY

BURNS and GEORGE LEVINE.

He had never met these individuals

before and at the time of the meeting had no indication

as to their background or business

enterprises.

NIX:

It is noted SALLY

BURNS is the main

alias used by SALVATORE GRANELLO, Well known/ to the NYO

and to the

Bureau in connection with the CARMINE Di BIASE, Top Ten

Fugitive cèse.

It is. known that GEORGE

associated with GRANELLO in mutual gambling interests

in Havana, Cuba.

N.Y., Cuba

BURNS and LEVINE requested POLLACK to cooperate

with them in setting up a Ready-Mix Cement business

in Havana, Cuba:

Their suggestion was that POLLACK

"front" the enterprise, which they indicated would

necessarily be successful die to political connections

which these individuals had in Havana. POLLACK stated

this venture did not ultimately materialize due to

diffleulties which arose in obtaining a second hand

ready-mix plant from the United States:

However;

during

the

time plans were being made for setting up this business,

POLLACK made three trips to Cuba between July, 1957

and November 1, 1957.

POLLACK advised that he made each trip

with GENNA, and that on each occasion they conferred

NY 92-632

with GEORGE LEVINE, who at that time resided at the

Hotel Rosita de Horanodo in Havana:

On the first

triP LEVINE took them to a proposed plant site and

assured them that they would have no difficulty obtaining

an option on this land or any probiems during the setting

up stages of the plant dục to his excellent connections

in the Cuban Government: On wat POLLACK believed to be

the second trip, LEVINE, GONNA and POLLACK arranged

for corporation papers to be drawn up in order-that

the business could be inetituted when they were able

to obtain the necessary equipment in the United States:

LEVINE assured them that he and SALLY BURNS would

guarantee contracts from the Cuban Government which

would insure a profitable operation

They expected

50% of the proceeds of the operation for the use of

their influence in establishing this business.

However;

as mentioned above, the business never got into

operation due to GENNA's difficulty in obtaining the

correct equipment stemming from a financial problem

on GENNA's part.

While in Havana on these three trips,

POLLACK accompanied LEVINE to various gambling casinos

in Havana and to the Oriente Race Track near Havana,

which LEVINE told POLLACK he and BURNS

'owned. POLLACK

remarked' that the horse races at the track did not

seem to be set up with the idea of a large profit being

made on the racing' end of the business, inasmuch as

most of the races involved only a $50 or $100 purse.

Instead, LEVINE indicated that they made their money

which they operated at

the track site.

Fron two gambling urine his visits to varlous Havana

casinos, POLLACK advised that he met a large number

of individuals who appeared to be connected with these

casinos, whom LEVINE appeared to know very well:

POLLACK mentioned that LEVINE introduced

him to an individual identified only as LEFTY CLARK, who

was a pit

boss in one of the casinos.

It is

noted that this individual is probably identical

with WILLIAM BISCHOFF, with alias LEFTY CLARK, Miami

In addition to LEFTY CLARK, POLLACK

advised thai he met MEYER LANSKY and SANTOS

RAFFICANTE

who was introduced as Mr. SANTOS.

cuba

According to POLLACK, on the last day

of his most recent stay in Havana with LiVINE, POLLACK

remarked that he and GENNA were waiting downstairs at

the Hotel Rosita de Horanodo for LEVINE who planned

to leave for the United States with them by air.

According to POLLACK, when LEVINE failed to appear.

In the hotel lobby after a considerable wait, he

left GENNa in the lobby and went up to LEVIN's hotel

room to hacry him up.

He advised that he walked

in without knocking and LEVINE seemed quite upset

about his bursting into the room in this manner.

POLLACK stated that there were approximately six

men in the room besides LEVINE, one of whom he recognized

the individual previously introduced to him as

Mr: SANTOS. LEVINE referred to one of the men seated

apart from

the others as

"JOEY A."

' From subsequent

discussion with LEVINE and from observing a newspaper

photo, POLLACK advised that the individual referred

to as JOEY A. WaS JOE ADONIS, well known NY

hoodlum who had been deported

to Italy in 1956.

Inasmuch as this Ready-Mix Cement deal

fell through, POLIACK indicated that he had no

further dealings with SALLY BURNS until a time which

he believed to be in January, 1958, when he became

in a serious need of money in connection with his

business:

in about January, 1958, POLLACK contacted

BURNS and received a $5,000 loan to be repaid in six

months with $1,000 in interest.

$2,000 of this loan

on a number of telephones installed at the Statcwide

publishing Company, Inc.

BURNS stipulated that this

deposit with the Telephone. Company be placec

in the naile of JOE QUACLIARELLO, whom POLLAck came

to Inow as koth JOE OUELLI and Little Joe, a close

Nit

In about February or March, 1958, BURNS

contacted PULLACK and unexpectedly demanded that

the $5,000 loan and interest be repaid innediately.

POLLACK told BURNS he did not have the money at

the time and would experience difficulty in obtaining

such a sun at the time.

BURNS became very insistent

and throatened POLLACK with

a beating. It he did not.

repay the money imnediately. During the next month,

POLLACK contacted close friends and from these individuals

burrowed the $6,000 which was repaid to BURNS

in about four installments:

After paying the balance

of the loan, BURNS told POLLACK that he had decided

that $4,000

interest was owed on the loan in addition

to the s1,000 already paid.

During the next three

or four months, POLLACK paid the additional $4,000

due to the threats and pressure exerted by EURNS.

POLLACK advised that during the time he was repaying

the loan and interest to BURNS, he was subjected

to three beatings by BURNS and

two of his musclemen

Identified. only as BABE and CHICK., POLLACK said that

two of these beatings took place in BURNS' apartment

at 215 Mott Street, and the other beating took place

also became acquainted with a young muscleman

referred to only as EDDy, who appeared to be closely

connected

with BURNS.

From PoLLack's description

of this indiviaual, he may be identical with BUDDY COPPOLLA

known to the New York Office as being associated

with GRANELLO: POLLACK added that during his visits

referred to as TONY BENDER and JOHNNY BATHBEACH, respectively.

He also remarked that on one occasion at a time

when

he had $1,000 to pay BURNS on the interests BURNS

claimed to be accumulated, BURNS, during a telephone

call instructed him to drop off the $1,000 with

JOHNNY BATHBEACH at the Club 13 at Avenue U and

l 13th

Street, Brooklyn, New York:

POLLACK continued

that when he appeared at the Club 13, ODDO introduced

him to an individual referrred to only as MINx

or MINXIE •

ODDO then left the club alone with POLLACK

and directed POLLACK to a late model Cadillac automobile

parked outside the clup

where he actually turned

over the $1,000 to ODDO:

POLLACK advised that the

above was the extent of his contact with ODDO.

Both STROLLO and ODDO are top hoodlums of the

NYO.

Concerning STROLLO and GENOVESE,

POLLACK related that he once accompanied SALLY BURNS

to the Erb Strapping Company at what he believed to

Do 180 Thompson Street and upon entry into this

company's office, BURNS inquired of a receptionist

where GENOVESE waS:

According to POLLACK, she

replied that Mr. GENOVESE was in conference to which

BURNS replied to the best of POLLACk's recollection

"To hall with him"

and proceded directly into

GENOVESE's office.

From what POLLACK observed, GENOVESE

did not appear disturbed by this and BURNS and

GENOVESE

proceeded to converse in the inner office in a friendly

manner.

POLLACK noted that at that time GENOVESE

appeared to have been in conference with an

individual referred to as being from New Jersey who

he believed was called "GyP The Blood" or RAY, and

an individual referred to only as Johnny The Bug.

'POLLACK identified a photograph of JOHN

STOPPELLE, with alias, Johnny The Buggas the

Individual referred to above.

It is noted that

STOPPELLI is known to the NYO as a close associate

POLLACK also advised that on one

occasion when he was told to proceed to the above-mentioned

unmarked office at 40 Exchange Place, NYC, that

he observed VITO GENOVESE leaving the office as he

He advised that he had no conversation

with GENOVESE, and that GENOVESE did not acknowledge

his presence at the time.

POLLACK related that a short time after he

had completed his payments to SALLY BURNS, aggregating

$10,000, that he was contacted by BURNS and instructed

to come to BURNS' apartment on a business matter.

Upon

arrival at his apartment, BURNs explained to him that

he was taking over an interest in a New York night

club, the Care de Paris, au 53ra Street and Broadwey,

Men a club featuring be came entertainment NY

policy. It was explained to POLLACK that LoU

well-known New York City night club impresaric

was in

financial jam in this club which he nad opened, and

BURNS told

POLLACK that he, POLLACK, was to assume

duties as front man in the club.

According to POLLACK,

when he complained to BURNS that he had no particular

interest in entering such a venture, BURNS reportedly

instructed him in no uncertain terms that he was to

take the job that ra had no choice in the matter.

In

view of the physical violence inflicted on POLLACK during

previous contacts with BURNS and his group, POLLACK

related thai he saw no alternative but to follow BURNS'

instructions.

According to POLLACK, he served as manager

at this club

for about four or five

weeks until the

club folded and went into bankruptcy.

During this period,

he related that SALLY BURNS contributed a total of about

$13,000 to the operation of the club and he, POLLACK, figured

he personally contributed close to. $30,000, which he had

been able to borrow from close friends.

When asked

why he contributed his own money in a venture in which he

had no choice at the outset, POLLACK explained that once

he became connected with the club, he figured that if they

could survive the conparitively slim summer night club

trade,

that he was convinced the club would be a success once the

winter season began. POLLACK noted that the clus featured

such entertainers as BETTY HUTTON, JERRY LEWIS, and BOB

HOPE.

POLLACK explained that while the club was

in operation, BURNS gave the indication that the

$13,000 he contributed was as an investment in this

venture, Howeves, when the club went into bankruptcy,

BURNS then informed POLLACK that he was responsible

for the $13,000 as a personal loan from BURNS to POLLACk,

and thereafter, once again began demands on POLLACK

not only for the floan pal $13,000, bit for exhortitant:

interest on this

which

to date amounts to a

total of approximately $16,000, according to POLLACK.

Though BURNS took no active part in

managing this club, POLlACK remarked that he was often

there during the evening hours as

were some.of his

underlings, specifically, the individuals refered to

previously as BABE, CHICK, and BUDDY.

POLLACK also noted that a part of the $13,000

contributed by BURNS was raised in the folluwing manner:

At a particular time when POLIACK was having

difficulty meeting the payroll, BURNS instructed him to

accompany JOE QUAGLIARELLO tO New Jersty, where they were

to pick up $2,500 from the RAY previously mentionea as

having been in the office of VITO GENOVESE on Thompson

Street.

POLLACK accompanied QUAGLIARELLO tO New Jersey,

to a roadside club where they met Ray who turned over

the $2,500 to QUAGLIARELLO. Exom POLLACK's description

of his trip to New Jersey, and the layout of this roadside

club, together with his description of RaY, a group of

photographs including that-of ANGELO DE CARLO, Newark

top hoodlum, was exhibited to POLLACK. POLLACK identified

the photograph of DE CARLO as the RAY who furnished the

$2,500 and as the individual from New Jersey he had

previously observed in the office of GENOVESE in New York

City. POLLACK stated that this was his only contact with

DE CARLO.

The roadside club where this money was obtained

appears to be the Martinique restaurant, operated by

DE CARLO in Mountainside, New Jersey.

of the cafe de jaris, his only contacts with BURNS and

his element have been

at times when BURNS has demanded

payment plus interest

on the $13,000 he put into this

club.

During the discussion of individuals he

came into contact with

during association with BURNS,

POLLACK mentioned

that at one time during early 1958,

while he was wish BUENS at a tavern in Atlantic Beach,

Long Island, an individual identified by BURNS as Mr.

this appeared to be a chance meetirg, and that there was

no discussion between BURNS and this individual.

subsequently, POLLACK identified a photograph

Of JOHN ORMENTO, New York top hoodlum, as the individual

he observed in the above tavern.

POLLACK also mentioned that while in Havana,

POLLACK stated that he was furnishing this

information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),.

he was called uncn by the prominent people backing the

track to give them advice and assistance in developing

will be issued within a couple of weeks.

He advised that

the track is for trocters and that there has already been

approved by the Canadian Govemment.

He advised the entire

track transaction is entirely legitimate.

From a portion

of the proceeas of the stock from this track, he

expects to repay SALLY BURNS a total of $13,00 and clear
