in Miami on PAA ight 422 on'S May 1962.

2. Subjects'a and b are sisters and were questioned together... Onl
the topic of receptton of. radio programs in’Cuba, both, were agreed: that}:
the best reception was the "Voz de las Americas" which camé “in strong. |
and clear with rarely any interference jamming.. Program content wa:
described as. generally good, gave a morale boost to the audience and

- was” becoming popular.

3. In commenting on Radio Las Americas, they’ pointed out that
'they. had not heard it or attempted to tune in ‘because: th: felt the
quality was much the same as its predecessor, “Radio Swan" which Jost
its prestige prior to and during the April 1961 invasion attempt. Both
declared this was a general opinion among their acquaintances,

4. Subjects commented very favorably on programs heard over
station XEW, Mexico and WRUL, New York, describing reception and ‘con-
tent as .good and with large audiences in Cuba.

5. In referring to other programs, subjects reported that on
1 May, relatives in‘the Matanzas arca telephoned them: in’ Havana to tell)
them that the “students" (DRE) were.on again (TV intrusion), Also,
Jater in the day, friends in the Vedado area called to tell them to
tune into Channel, 2, that there was a program there (about, 2115. hours
local). Unfortunately, they had already ‘sold their’ TV set since: they
were leaving soon, Both agreed that ‘the system of announcing the TV.
intrusion broadcasts over CONTE Aguero's program.on WRUL a few minutes
prior to the intrusion was the key to large audiencés, -Almost all ~
GOC oppositionists upon hearing this announcement, start telephoning
their friends to tune into ‘the TV channel announced. ‘

6. Conceraing the DRE intcrnal ‘organization, subjects reported”
that they had. not been active recently and not witting to clandestine
operations, . They. were aware, however, that. the DRE internal net was—
waiting for the infiltration of AMHINT-53 or AMHINT-2.to brief them on
the situation in exile and what support would be forthcoming. They
reiterated the reports on two bombs set off.in the university area by
the DRE and burning of cane and .ienequen fields in Matanzas and Las

Villas. :

7. When queried on disturbances in Las Villas and/or Matanzas on
or about 3 May, they replied that (hey Neatd the persistent rumor that
a unit (company or regirent unknown) of militia had bolted and gone
up into the Escambray Mountains, -No further details were known,

1 8. When questioned on written propaganda such as flyshcets or
clandestine newsheets, both declared. that the last propaganda seen was

{ the clandestine issue on “Trinchera” (DRE organ), that no other pro-

\ paganda sheets had been. seen Since before tiie April tnvasion,

9. When asked their impression on anti-CASTRO propaganda in’
general they felt that it was too negative: that while the exiles and
opposition groups were busy tearing down the imayze of CASTRO, he was
before the people with some proposal that was based either on truth,
had a ring of truth in it, or al least appealed to the masses. , That
some of thei contacts with young girls who served as “brigadistas"
(rural tutors in the campaign for literacy) turned up interesting
remarks. These girls claimed that many of the country fo1k, would ‘throw
‘S thetr hands in dismay when Communism was mentioned to them, and

10... Subjects alsé felt that propaganda should be directéd more
toward that sector of Cubans “that are not fanatic Fidelistas ‘or
communists, and have not comhited. themselves ‘to the opposition movement
for,such reasons as indolence, lack of courage, or economic docibility:
Raquel remarked that our propaganda seemed to be divided “into two
broad categories, one directed at.or attacking the hard-core Fidelistas|
and the-other for opposition movement consumption,

1. Subject c above. was debricfed for her report on reception of
a FALCON broadcast in Havana on -1-May 1962. She stated that she was
€alled by a friend at about 2100 howrs.on 1 May and told that the DRE
Trinchera.-program was being broadcast over Channel. 2 at that moment.’
Miriam turned on her. TV-and does not recall how high she had to turn.u
