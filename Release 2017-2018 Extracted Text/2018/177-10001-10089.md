WASHINGTON

December 23, 1964

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJECT: Miscellaneous

1.

Dillon Committee

Reminder - You indicated that you might want to talk

to Kermit Gordon about the possibility of putting the necessary money for the

Secret Service into the Budget without checking back with the President. It

would probably be a good idea to talk to Gordon soon since I understand that

the Budget will be closed for printing in the very near future. Gordon's office

tells me that he will be back in Washington on Thursday.

If we don't take this route, then it means that somebody will have to get hold

of the President and get his explicit approval before we run out of time.

2. My Christmas Plans - I plan to spend Christmas with my in-laws in New

Jersey this weekend and to be back in Washington on Monday night. I will be

reachable on 609-882-3987.

3. British Guiana - Bill Cobb gave me a few high-lights of the recent US/UK

meeting in London. First, Greenwood is still thinking that a rapprochement

between Jagan and Burnham would be a good thing. However, he does not yet

seem to be prepared to do anything about it. Second, the British Ministers

are not sure they like us to be in the

business.

6(12(B)

(C)

The British are

presently in the process of reviewing their policy on BG to see whether they

want to continue things as they are or whether they want to see some changes;

presumably, the

/question will be covered in this general review. Mean-

while - business as usual. Third, the British don't want us to talk to Burnham

about economic aid before they have had a chance to talk to the Governor. We

expect to hear from the British in a week or two on this question, and do not

expect any trouble; they seem to like our economic program.

Bill said the talks, on the whole and as usual, were forthright and friendly.
