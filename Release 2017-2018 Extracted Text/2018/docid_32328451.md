ADMINISTRATIVE

Information obtained from CG 6343-C*, if

utilized,

must be carefully paraphrased in order that

the identity of this source is not disclosed.

On December 18, 1959, CG 6343-C* advised that

a person believed to be LEONARD PATRICK briefly appeared

CG T-10 stated that these "district men" are required to

pay a certain sum of money each month to GIANCANA, who in turn,

turns over a certain sum to ACCARDO.

The district men are allowed

rather wide latitude in the means they exercise to raise this

money and any money they make in excess of the amount payable to

GIANCANA may be counted as their profit.

The informant pointed out

these payments must be made promptly and in cash and failure to meet

these obligations are generally deemed to be a fatal mistake.

This

informant pointed out that the principal thing that

the "syndicate" has to sell is protection. For example, protection

from police action and protection from other hoodlums.

The

informant noted the fact that gambling is protected from police

action and this inevitably gives rise to other criminal activity

such as prostitution, narcotics, and fencing.

The informant pointed

out that if the police are compromised in one activity there is a

certain reluctance to act in another direction.

The informant

stated that the district man is under considerable compulsion to

raise a certain amount of money each month, and if gambling revenues

are uncertain or inadequate he will turn to any means available.

On February 25, 1958, CG T-ll advised SA RAYMOND J

DRISCOLL, in answer to the question as to the existence and identity

of a "syndicate", was most emphatic that a "syndicate" exists and total

members might number as high as twenty-five.

CG T-1l doubted that

there

was anyone man in charge. He explained that certain men in

various levels of power exist in certain areas of Chicago. For

example, LENNY PATRICK and DAVE YARAS of Jewish parentage

control.

the Roosevelt Avenue area,

and their headquarters is at Roosevelt

and Independence Boulevard.

Gambling

Bookmaking

On February 26, 1958, CG T-12 advised SA HAROLD D. SELL

PATRICK as

an operator in a 50-50 book in

1948 and 1949.

This book was operated in a barber shop at 330 West

Roosevelt and

his payments were made to LENNY PATRICK at the New

awndale Restaurant in that neighborhood. CG T-12 states that at

chat time Parkick was in control of the New Lawndale Restaurant anc

there was a full-scale hard card book being operated there.

According to CG T-12, PATRICK had the area from Kedzie to Cicero and

from Madison south to approximately 18th Street. No one could open

a book or take on any bets unless he had the OK of PATRICK. At

that time PATRICK's lieutenants were YARAS and BLOCK.

was

a gambling room in the rear of this building which had an

entrance near 944 Eastwood Avenue. It was a big "pan" and poker

game mainly played by the "Jewish

i boys". He stated that he saw

several people driving big Cadillacs go into this gambling room,

but he did not know who they were.

He stated this room did not

have a liquor

bar, but did have a little snack or sandwich bar.

He stated that to the best of his knowledge, this game was

"wide open".

On March 18, 1958, CG T-15 advised that the gambling

joint at 948 West Eastwood is owned by MAX NEEDLER (phonetic),

and is controlled by the "outfit".

CG T-15 added that the owner-

ship and license of this place was in the name of BOB GRIFFIN Or

GRIFFITH who worked there at one time but is no longer there now.

According to CG T-15, GRIFFIN would like to get his name off of

these records, but was afraid to do so because of the "outfit".

CG T-16 advised on December 15, 1959, that during the

latter part of November a friend of his was approached by HENRY

FRIEDENBERG, the owner and operator of Arcadia Press.

Arcadia

Press is one of the three large distributors of football parley

cards in the Chicago area.

CG I-16 stated that the purpose of FRIEDENBERG's appreach

was to have his friend contact LENNY PATRICK. CG T-16 stated that

PATRICK was a fairly close friend of his and had been for approxi-

mtely 15 or 20 years.

He said that FRIEDENBERG asked his friend

to contact PATRICK die to the fact that BILL FINKEL had recently

died.

CG T-16 noted that FINKEL operated a "Jewish card room"

in the vicinity of Morse and Glenwood on the far North Side of

Chicago in the territory controlled by LENNY PATRICK.

FRIEDENBERG

asked his friend to urge PATRICK to let him, FRIEDENBERG, take

over the operation of this card room.

CG T-16 advised that as a result of FRIEDENBERG's request,

this individual met PATRICK on the night of November 23, 1959,

room,

and that FINKEL had operated the games in

the card room only

as a front for PATRICK.

PATRICK told informant's friend that the

room was, in fact, owned by PATRICK and that "out of

the goodness

of his heart" he was giving the widow of FINKEL $100, a month as

compensation for the loss of her husband's income.

PATRICK claimed that he already had someone else in

mind to take over this card room,

and that he should tell FRIEDEN-

BERG that he was "out of luck" in this regard.

III. ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES

Gambling

CG T-18 advised on October 9, 1961, that a bookie

named BEN CUTLER is operating his books mostly in Cicero,

Illinois, at the present time.

He said, however, that CUTLER

continues to operate to some

deeree in the vicinity of

Ogden and Kedzie Avenues in Chicago. According to CG T-19

LENNY PATRICK obtainss50 per cent of CUTLER's income from

operations.

CG T-18 advised on October 27, 1961, that he has

known LENNY PATRICK for many years as the gambling boss

in Chicago's 24th Ward and PATRICK obtains a 50 per cent

interest of all proceeds from gambling activity in this

Ward.

He said PATRICK's 24th Ward headquarters are in the

Douglas Park Hotel in about the 3600 block of West Roosevelt

Road, Chicago, and his office is directly behind the hotel

desk.

CG T-18 also advised that LENNY PATRICK's brother,

JACK

PATRICK is at the hotel more than LENNY.

CG T -18 further advised that LENNY PATRICK

approached him about two months ago and wanted him to open

a bookie operation.

PATRICK advised him this would be a

fifty-fifty deal with any police payoffs coming out of the

informant's 50 per cent.

The informant stated that he

turned PATRICK down on this deal.

CG T-19 advised recently that he had received information

that LEONARD PATRICK had recently become involved in an

argument with one LOUIS CIRIONA over the operation of a

horse book on the north side of Chicag.

CG T-19 stated that

CIRIONA is a runner for LOUIS BRIATTA who controls bookmaking

activities

in Chicago's Loop area. BRIATTA is directly

answerable to Chicago hoodlums GUS ALEX and FRANK FERRARO.

ba ma cus

Informant was of the opinion that the argument was due to the

fact that CIRIONA had been given authority to operate a horse

book in a particular area by SAM GIANCANA. This fact was

discovered by PATRICK who attempted to disuade CIRIONA from

operating. Failing to do so PATRICK reportedly went. to

GUS ALEX in an effort to settle the dispute.

On June

THOMAS W. PARRISH and advised that the underworld group had

controlled the complete operations of the call system run by

into obtaining more and more girls for prostitution.

She

In a "Daily News" article dated January 5,

1953, concerning the slaying of MILTON GLICKMAN whose

1953, It was stated that the police were seeking LEONARI
