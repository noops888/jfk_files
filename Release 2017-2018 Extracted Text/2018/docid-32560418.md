Street, Philadelphia, Pa. Since date of original
communication in this matter, the instant company. has
purchased a public address eystem which necessitated
additional wiring by the telephone companys, The Phila-
delphia Division has been told by their contact with the
telephone company that the owners of the Maggio Cheese
Company and the Millmaid Dairy Products Company were
suspicious of. any activity on the part of the telephone
men installing the above speaker system if it appeared
that these individuals were im a part of the company
building not directly related to the location where a
speaker was. being installed. These businesses operate
on a 2i<hour basis and.entry would have to be during the
normal daylight working hours. If the Bureau authorizes

’ dnstallation at the Maggio Cheese Company, it is requested
by the Philadélphia Division that a thoroughly trained
sound agent from the Laboratory or a surrounding field
diviston. be allowéa to come to Philadelphia for the
installation propery. This request is being made based
on the fact that: the sound men assigned to Philadelphia
have either conducted interviews with persons owning or.
employed by the Maggio Cheese Company or have been assigned
to-the division for & long period of time and could possibly
be known. ‘It is also felt that this would be advisable due
to the sudpicious nature of the owners of the Maggio Cheese
Company. There willbe facilities to bring the microphone
surveillance from the company location for two microphones
only as the company is located in a heavily eonjested area.
At. the desired locations for installation of a microphone
there are facilities. available.which are arranged so, that
they do not enter into any of the telephone’ automatic
eguipment.s. The. only possible equipment syltable for in-
stallation in this case would be a "mate."

it. ‘installation is authorized, it is felt that
the person making such installation should have proper
identification from the telephone company which can be
arranged by the Philadelphia Divisions It is brought to
the Bureau's attention that.SA BRUCE FISHER recently
assigned to the Laboratory, may have thie iddntification
at the aia time.
