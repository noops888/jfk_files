Remarks: (Continued-)

Street, Philadelphia, Pa.

Since date of original

communication in this matter, the instant company has

purchased a publie address system which necessitated

additional wiring by the telephone company.

The Phila-

delphia Division has been told by their contact with the

telephone company that the owners of the Maggto Cheese

Company and the Milkmald Dairy Products Company were

suspicious of any activity on the part of the telephone

men instanting the above speaker system it it appeared

individuals were in a part of the company

building not directly related to the location where a

speaker was being installed. These businesses operate

on a 24-hour basis and entry would have to be during the

normal daylight working hours. If the Bureau authorizes

Installation at the Maggio Cheese Company, it 1s requested

Philadelphia Division that e thoroughly trained

sound agent from the Laboratory on a surrounding field

division be allowed to come to Philadelphia for the

installation proper

this request 1s being made based

on the fact that the sound men assigned to Philadelphia

have either conducted interviews with persons owning or

employed by the Magslo Cheese Company or have been assigned

to the alvision for a long period of time and could possibly

be known. It ls also felt that this would be advisable due

to the suspicious nature of the owners of the Naggio Cheese

Company.

There will be fallitles to bring the microphone

survelllance from the company location for two microphones

only as the company. 18 located in a heavily conjested area.

At the desired locations for inatallation of a mierophone

there are racities available which are arranged so that

thoy do not enter into any of the telephone automatic

equipment.

stallation in the case would be a "mate.

The only possible equipment syitable fos in-

If installation is suthorized, it le felt that

the person making such installation should have proper

identification fron the telephone company which can be

arranged by the niladelphia Divisions

It 1s brought to

the Bureau's attention that A BRUCS FISHER recently

assigned to the laboratory, may have thie idêntification

at the present time.
