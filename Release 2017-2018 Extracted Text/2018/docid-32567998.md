SECRET, Date

Dr. William A. Eirepitins eee Division,
Atomic Energy Commission, Germantown, Maryland, furnished
the following information:

On September 4, 1963, he was in Moscow, Russia,
for a scientific conference. He attended the opera that
evening and then returned to the Ukraine Hotel, where he
met Louis Jones through a colleague, Dr. Paul Me Daniel.
Bre. lic Daniel and Jones were convei ring at a table and
Dr. Wallenmeyer joined them for about fifteen or twenty
minutes, during the middle part of their conversation.
During this partiof the conversation, Jones mentioned
returning to the United States to continue his education.
Also during this time, Dr. Mc Daniel asked Jones if he knew
he was in trouble with the State Department over his travel
to Cuba. Dr. Wallenmeyer's impression was that Jones
realized that he was, but he seemed to think it ccuid be
cleared up.

Dr. Wallenmeyer had no information that Jones had
knowledge of United States travel regulations before going to
Cuba. Also, he did not know how cr when Jones went to Cuba.
He thought Jones had a fairly gocd technical job in Cuba. He

- also thought that Jones sid that he (Sones) had no passport.
Dr. Wallenmeyer said he did not pay much attention to Jones!
statements, Jones impressed him es a person who was not
against what is being done in the United States but who thought
what was being done in Cuba was a good thing. He seemed to
think he was helping the Cubans and wes helping himself at
the same time. He did not talk against the United States,
and even mentioned that he wanted to come back to this country.
At the same time, he was not disillusicned about what was
going on in Cuba. Dr. Wallenmeyer was not sure that he was
present when Dr. Me Daniel asked Jones if he was amemher of
the Communist Party. He did have the impression that Jones
was not overly concerned that he was in trouble over his
travel to Cuba, He said he did not believe that Jones was on
a hate campaign against the United States during the
portion of the conversation he heard.

Mr. Wallenmeyer is willing to testify to his contact
with Jones in Moscow.

SECRET.

Dr. Paul W. Mc Daniel, Mrector, Division of Research,
Atomic Energy Commission, Germantown, Maryland, furnished the
following information:

Date October

He was in Moscow during August and September, 1963, for
a scientific conference, On September 4, 1963, the night before
he left Moscow, he met Louis Henry Jones in the Ukraine Hotel
in Moscow. At this hotel one orders coffee at a serving
bar, then carries it to any available table. On this occasion
Jones was occupying a table where Dr. Mc Daniel found an
empty seat,

He described Jones as about 28-30 years old;
slender face, and large prominent mouth. . Jones has a really
out-going, bubbing personality. He introduced himself and
told Dr. Mc Daniel that he was an American citizen and lived
in Havana, Cuba. Dr. Mc Daniel became interested then and
talked with Jones for about an hour, starting at 11 p.m.,
September 4, 1963. Jones said that he had not finished his
education and wanted to return to the United States to do so.
Although Dr. Me Daniel cannot recall. the verbatim conversation,
there is no question in his mind that Jones was sympathetic
to communism. He asked if Jones was a member of the Communist
Party. Jones said he was not a member of the Communist Party
but was fully sympathetic with the aims and goals of the communist
movement. This was almost an exact quote of Jones' response,
to Dr. Mc Daniel's recollection.

Jones did not say why he was in Moscow. However,
he was greeted by a number of Spanish speaking people,
mostly women, who treated him with some deference as if he
were a guide of some sort for a tour. This, however, was
only an impression of Dr. Mc Daniel's and he had no conversation
with Jones to verify it. Dr. Me Daniel did not see Jones!
wife in Moscow and had the impression that she was a psychologist
like him.

Jones said he went to Cuba on vacation about the
time of the revolution in Cuba. He considers Castro a great
man who has done so much for the Cubans that they can never

repay him. Jones described Castro as a humanitarian who
does not like violence, When Dr, Me Daniel asked him about
the executions by Castro, Jones defended Castro and
explained the executions in this way: during the revolution
when the citizens of Cuba caught followers of Batista,
Castro told them not to take the law into their own hands
but to let the revolution handle those people. If Castro
.had not done this, thousands would have been’ killed. Then,
although Castro did not like to do it, he had to execute
Some to fulfill his promise to the people,

Jones was aware of Dr. Me Daniel's position ‘with
the United States Government, When asked if he did not
think he was in trouble with the State Department over his
travel to Cuba, he said he was sure he was. He said that
he expected to have serious trouble, but said this would be
on the conscience of the United States Government and not
on his. He made several very Cercgatery remarks about
the United States Department of State and the United States
Government generally, These remarks alleged that the
United States Government lied about Cuba, and about
atrocities there and took military steps against Cuba.

Jones said that in Cuba, he was working for a lady
about thirty-seven years old, He Gaid he.is.a.psychologist.
is boss there in Cuba is a fine woman dedicated to the
revolution. Jones said he found it a wonderful opportunity.
He has a free reign to conduct researchge,

Dr. Mc Daniel asked him why so many people left
Cuba. Jones said the Batista Government had a large number
of exploiters, They knew no other life. They ran Cuba.
They were intelligent and important. In the new socialist
order they just did not fit and they left. Jones said
this was for the betterment of the Cuban system. He expected
the revolution to be a complete success and does not expect
many of these people to ever return to Cuba.

Jones said he does not have a passport. He did
not say how he left the United States or how he traveled
to Cuba, other than to say he went there on a vacation.

Dr. Mc Daniel asked Jones how he explained having
three servants during this revolution. He explained the
servants by saying that this was a transition period
in the revolution.

Jones contended that communism in theory is right.
Although Dr. Mc Daniel cannot recall Jones! exact words, he
received the impression 7/2" Jones 2u2%)jlooked upon the
revolution in Cuba as the beginning of great cause,
In Dr. Me Daniel's opinion, Jones! attitude toward
communism is an attitude one would expect him to have
if he had been born in Russia’ and had grown up under
communism,

Dr. Me Daniel had no infomation that Jones had
knowledge of United States travel regulations when he
went to Cuba.

Dr. Me Daniel is willing to appear and testify
to the above information in an administrative or
judicial hearing.

for a scientific conference. He attunded the opera that
evening and then returned to the Ukraine Hotel, where he
met Louis Jones through a colleague, Dr. Paul Me Daniel.
De. Lis Daniel and Jones were conversing at a table and
Dr. Wallenmeyer joined them for about fifteen or twenty
minutes, during the middle part of their conversation.
During this partof the conversation, Jones mentioned
returning to the United States to continue his education.
Also during this time, Dr. Mc Daniel asked Jones if he knew
he was in trouble with the State Department over his travel
to Cuba. Dr. Wallenmeyer's impression was that Jones
realized that he was, but he seemed to think it ccuid be
cleared up.

Dr. Wallenmeyer had no information that Jones had
knowledge of United States travel regulations before going to
Cuba. Also, he did not know how or when Jones went to Cuba.
He thought Jones had a fairly good technical job in Cuba. He
also thought that Jonessiid that he (Jo: nes) had no passport.
Dr. Wallenmeyer said he did not pay much attention to Jones!
statements, Jones impressed him as a person who was not
against what is being done in the United States but who thought
what was being done in Cuba was a good thing. He seemed to
think he was helping the Cubans and was helping himself at
the same time. He did not talk against the United States,
and even mentioned that he wanted to come back to this country.
At the same time, he was not disillusicned about what was
going on in Cuba. Dr. Wallenmeyer was not sure that he was
present. when Dr. Me Daniel asked Jones if he was amemher of
the Communist Party. He did have the impression that Jones
was not overly concerned that he was in trouble over his
travel to Cuba. He said he did not believe that Jones was on
a hate campaign against the United States during the
portion of the conversation he heard.

Mr. Wallenmeyer is willing to testify to his contact

in Moscow, At this hotel one orders coffee at a serving
bar, then carries it to any available table, On this occasion
Jones was occupying a table where Dr. Me Daniel found an
empty seat.

He described Jones as about 28-30 years old;
slender face, and large prominent mouth. Jones has a really
out-going, bubb&%ing personality. He introduced himself and
told Dr. Mc Daniel that he was an American citizen and lived
in Havana, Cuba. Dr. Mc Daniel became interested Shen and
talked with Jones for about an hour, starting at ll p.m.,
September 4, 1963. Jones said that he had not finished his
education and wanted to return to the United States to do so.
Although Dr. Me Daniel cannot recall. the verbatim conversation,
there is no question in his mind thst Jones was sympathetic
to communism. He asked if Jones was a meniber of the Communist
Party. Jones said he was not a member of the Communist Party
but was fully sympathetic with the aims and goals of the communist
movement, This was almost an exact quote of Jones! response,
to Dr. Mc Daniel's recollection.

he was greeted by a number of Spanish speaking people,
mostly women, who treated him with some deference as if he
were a guide of some sort for a tour. This, however, was
only an impression of Dr. Mc Daniel's and he had no conversation
with Jones to verify it. Dr. Me Daniel did not see Jones!

repay him, Jones described Castro as a humanitarian who
does not like violence. When Dr. Me Daniel aslted him about
the executions by Castro, Jones defended Castro and
explained the executions in this way: during the revolution
when the citizens of Cuba caught followers of Batista,
Castro told them not to take the law into their own hands
but to let the revolution handle those people. If Castro
had not done this, thousands would have been killed. Then,
although Castro did not like to do it, he had to execute
some to fulfill his promise to the people.

Jones was aware of Dr. Mc Daniel's position with
the United States Government. . When asked 1f he did not
think he was in trouble with the State Department over his
travel to Cuba, he said he was sure he was. He said that
he expected to have serious trouble, but said this would be
. on the conscience of the United States Government and not
on his. He made several very Ccercgatery remarks’ about

the United States Department of State and the United States
Government generally, These remar':s alleged that the
United States Government lied about Cuba, and about
atrocities there and took military steps ageinst Cuba.

Jones said that in Cuba, he was working for a lady -

about thirty-seven years old, He said ‘we.1s.a-psychologist.
His boss there in Cuba is a fine woman dedicated to the
revolution. Jones said he found it a wonderful opportunity,
He has a free reign to coaduct researchg#é,

Dr. Mc Daniel asked him why so many people left
Cuba, Jones said the Batista Government had a large number
of exploiters. They knew no other life. They ran Cuba,
They were intelligent and important. In the new socialist
order they just did not fit and they left. Jones said
+his was for the betterment of the Cuben system. He expected

received the imoression. fs Jones £64 looked upon the
