REF; HMMA 22297

1. The LIEMPTY Project was renewed on 17 January 1964 for
the period I December 1963 through 30 November 1964 for a total of
$49,700; $30,290 for FY 1964 and $19,410 for FY 1965.

2. The Station is requested to make an overall effort to
make maximum use of all agents, and to eliminate all marginal assets
in order to streamline operations and to introduce economy measures.
A separate dispatch has been prepared on Raymond H. GERENDE,
suggesting that ho be more fully utilized. with regard to the
photo surveillance basehouses and basehouse keepers under the LIEZMPTY
Project, it is requested that during the next project year special
attention be given to the value of the take from cach of these bases
keeping in mind the possibility of reducing the number of photo
basehouses against the LIMERICK target to at least two basehouses
without reducing the effectiveness. of KUBARK's coverage of tuis
prime target. If the Station finds that adequate coverage can only
be obtained through the continued use of all the assets presently
employed under the LIEMPTY Project, -special detail should be presented
in the next Project Renewal Request which would justify their

continuance,
