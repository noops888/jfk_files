Several girlfriends from high school know I joined BKHERALD
in 1951. I am no longer in touch with them.

I cannot recall, but I think when I opened charge accounts
in 1951 I put LNBUZZ. Any recent (past 15 years) appli-
cations-were under a cover organization...

Our lawyer; John 0. Dahlgren; Washington, D.C., probably
knows. He'is the brothér of a former RKHERALD employee
who was my boss,, but noft at thettime I hired John Dahlgren.
In the 50's I received some W-2's with BKHERALD listed as
the employer. This was policy at that time.
