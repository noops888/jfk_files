RE: ZRRIFLE

i rane 1, Per our discussion of 2 July 1962, Ieexpect that we
shall proceed to transfér QJWIN to Baden-Baden per the proposal
in QULAZ1263 dated 2 February 1962, LIXE/0,89 dated 19 June
1962 sated that COS would have the full details of the
capital outlay required by 23 June; however, the Information
has not been recejved as of 3 July, fhe last cable to the
Station, DIR, 18391 told COS to contact you directly on his
arrival on 16 duly. :

2, With regard to candidates spotted by QJWIN, the
two whom he spotted in Italy a year and a quarter ago can
Probably be used if needed, if we can accept the assessments
of them by the Trieste Base contract agent, Magonetti.

Magonetti's assessment is contained in OTRAz27542 dated
10 May 1961. The names of the two French candidates are con-

tained in QLIA, 1426 dated 15 December 1961. No action has
been taken on7these names regarding tracing or anything else.
: My handwritten notes attached to that dispatch contain
fuller descriptions of the two People than appear in the

3. eth tting effort that can be made is
enough in Rome. | Jwas well briefed
on the qualifications desired and thésecurity precautions

to be observed in the spotting activity. COS Rome has a
copy of the qua ications and restrictions in his safe: as
however, if is told to proceed with his contact in

Florence, I suggest that he be re-briefed in detail,
ni

4. Frankly, all the rest of the paper in the file is
crud except for the pay receipts which are assembicd in one
envelope. I have already given} ¢he ZPRIFLE authorization
Paper signed by Helms and Skip has been given the QJWIN con-
tract, including the extension to 1 March 1963,

5.° The details which have yet to be worked out are
a, The precise method of contact with QJWIN

b. The system of drawing funds for payments to him

¢. An emergency contact for him (this should RETURNS. c Ont
oduce

Probably be COS LUXE),

QJWIN can do more spotting fn Corsican circles whenever wé
