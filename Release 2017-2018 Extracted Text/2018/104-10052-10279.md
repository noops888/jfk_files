We Discover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA aia proauee one a Significant piece of information on Lee
OSWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
City Station intercepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD made from someplace
dn Mexico City to the Soviet Embassy there, using his own raze. Speaking
broken Russian ana using his true nae, OSWALD vas talking to the Bnbassy
svara, conan, Wao often answers the phone. OSWALD said he had visited
the Pr previous Saturday (23 ceptenber 1963) and spoken to a
consul whose name he had forgotten, and who haa promised to send a tele-
graa for him to Washington. Ee vanted to know ea

his plece of information was produced from a telephone tap center

is highly secret and not known to}

‘which are transcribed and reviewed by our

soall staff in Mexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone conversa-

tion of 1 October bad been tronseribed and a sumuary of it cabled to
Washington. The name Lee CSHALD meant nothing special to our Mexico
City Station, but in their report they did judge bin to be an American
nale.

The cabled report was received in Washington on 9 October and checked

in our files, where It was immediately noted that the Lee OSWALD phoning
the Soviet Exbassy in Mexico City was probably the Lee OSWALD who hed
defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 ani returned to the USA in 1962. On
10 October 1953, the day after the report from Mexica City, CIA Headquarters:
sent out a cabled report about Lee OSWALD’s phone call to the Soviet

. - .
Enbassy3; the report went to the FSI, the Departuent of State (because

CSMALD was 9 US citizen), end to the Havy Departsent (because he wes a

former Marine.) ‘The cabled report to these agencies highlighted the


14-00000

LikLihood that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defector.
A copy of this ssme cable was delivered by hand to the Imgration and
Haturalization Service, with which we have no cable Link. ‘The swse day

e long cadle vent out to Mexico City informing our Station of the back-
ground of defector lee OSWALD end asking for more infervation. Cur Station
was instructed to pass its inforsstion on the phone call. to the Mexteo
City offices of the FAI, the Enbassy, the Naval Attache, and the Ieeigra-
tion an aturalization Service. ‘This vas done.

In its original regort of 9 October, Mexico City hed sala it bad a

photograpa of an apsarent American vale leaving the Soviet Embassy on

1 Cetobex 1963, the day OSWALD phone there. A very sensitive operation

in Mexico City provides ua vith cecretly taken photographs of may but not
all visitors to the Soviet Eabassy there, taken with teleshoto lenses.
Accordingly, we cabled the lary Departzent on 2b October 1963 nating fox
8 photograph of Lea CSWALD fron his Marine Corpa days ao we coula compere
photos. We haa not received this photograph by 22 ss 1963, but in

any event, it turned out that the man photosraphea outside the Soviet



14-00000

Eubasay was not OSWALD enyway. As chance would bave it, none of our

several photo obsesation points in Mexico City had ever taken an identi~

fiable picture of lee CSWALD.

Our Mexico Clty Statioa very often produces information Lite this
on US citizens contacting Soviet bloc enbasaies in Mexico City. Frequently
the information ve get is extremely incriminating, and on one or two
occasions we have even been able to apprehend and return to the USA
Anerican military persemel who are attempting to defect. In all such
cases, our Hendquarters desk requests enl obtains the special ee of

the Deputy Director for Plans to pass the derogatory information on a US

“eltizen to other yovernment agencies. Derogatory information ou Americars

tragedy. When the name of Lee OSWALD was heard, the effect was electric.

our overseas stations, and many pieces of information on OSWALD aaa his
wife had beon received back. ‘the Mexico City Station researched its
telephove taps very thoroughly an8 cave up with several, more conversations
probably involving OSWALD, but not actually mentioning this nase; these
connected him also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. geveral vexteans
were arrested and questioned sbout his activities, giving a gooa pleture
of hat ho vas really up to. Many conferences were held with the Fal
liaison officer who asked us for certain actions and passed us inforsation

Soviet Consular file on OSWALD which had been publicly given by the Soviet
Anhssssdor to the Secretary of State. On Friday 6 December 1963, Deputy
Attorney General Katzenbach invited us to review the FAI's comprehensive
report on the case to make sure our sources vere not jeopardized and that
our information vas correctly quoted. We found the report highly
interesting and no threat to our security, as long as it was read only
by the outhérized Investisative bodies.

As soon a cur Mexico Clty Station realized that Lee OSHALD was the
prize suspect, it began re-vereening all the written telephone transeripte
in its files covering the Soviet Rubassy for the pertinent period. ‘the

actual tapes were also reviewed, but nany of them haa been erased after the



14-00000

normal two weeks wait. Several calls believed to involve OSWALD were
discovered and their contents cabled to Washington, where they vere
@isseninated to the White House, the State Departzent, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
OSWALD's name was not actually mentioned in these additional calls,

but pinilarity of speech and various plain points of content Link thea
to hin. ‘These calls ars swatarized below in chronological order.

Vell-placea sources within the Cuba Embassy in Hexico City stated
that vben Silvia DURAN vas released fron police arrest the first time on
25 Novenber; she was quite pleased with herself. She told ber colleagues
the sane story set out above, afding only that the Mextean police had

or the Cutan intelligence service.

The vbole question of vhether Les OSWALD haa any secret comection
with the Soviets or Cubans in Mexico cannot pet be ansvered, but certain

parts cf the evidence indicate to the contrary. Silvin DURW ana the



14-00000

Soviet Consular officials spoke of him as a maa with “no friends in Cuba”
on the one kana, apd es @ man not "known" in the Soviet Bsbassy, on the
other. The very openness of his visits and the phoue calls spenk against any
seerct role. His trip to Mexico vas not iteelf a secret nets he traveled
under his real name or a close variant of it, livea openly in Mexican
hotels, and corresponded with the Seviets through the open mall% about

it when be got back to the US, lite trip to Hextcs vas apparently maje
necessary because it was the nearest Cuban diplesatic installation where

he coula apply for a visa.

A perplexing aspect of CSHALD's trafficicing with the Cubans and
Soviets in Mexico City is his assertion in his call of 23 September that he
id not Imow hi edé@ress when he vas at the Soviet Consulate and cane to
the Cuban Consulate because they ked it. It 4a hard to explain just vest
he meant, but it shoula be reneabered that he was taluing in Fusstan,
language he could not zanaje, and that when he came te Mexico he was in the
process of moving from New Orleacs to ‘Texas. He may not have macorized

his new adéress in Texas, whatever it wes, and may not have been able to

Jay bands on 4t when he was dn the Soviet Consulate that day. Fer'zape
ke hea earlier given the addres to Silvia DUSAN and wanted to lock it
up on ber card.

A particularly sinister aspect of cous dealings faa the Soviets
in Mextee Clty arises fron the Likithood that he met vita Soviet Consul
Valeriy Viadinirovich KOSTIXOY, In his 1 October phone call. to the
Sovigt Exbassy, the guard ODYSDEDY suggests that the Consul CSYALD haa
talked to was KOBTIQOY if he us dark. OSWALD seems to agree with this,
‘but tha identification 1s very casual. In his 9 Noveuber letter to the
Soviet Consulate in Washington, OSWALD gives the naze of the man he’ dealt
with as "KOSTIN,” but there fe no person of that exact naxe In the Soviet
Embassy in Kexico Clty. KOSTIMOY is accredited as e Consular Attache and
does ectually do a lot of consular work, but he 1s believed to bea
Soviet KGB officer, and it is believed that he works for Department 13 of

¥ . .
the KGB, the Department charged with sabotage and assassinations. ‘The

suspicion that KOSTIXOY to a KGB officer arose from hic work habits, and

his nasociation with other KGB officers. It was hardened when it vas



14-00000

found that he handled a Soviet agent who vas trained to do sabotace
work and that he turnea this agent over to another KC3 officer who is
aefinitely known to work for the 13th Department. It is generally true
in KGB vor that sabotage agente are handled only by 13"Department
officers.

Eubasuy guard Ivan Ivanovich OJSDKOY is hinself believed to be a
KGB man fron previous assignments as a bodyguard and sureiliant. But
unless some direct evidence of Soviet complicity ts discovered, it is
most likely that OSWALD's dealing with KGB ren OBYSDKOY and KOSTICOY was
nothing more than a gria coincidence, a coincidence dus in part to the
Soviet habit of plocing intelligence men in the Eubassies tn positions
vhere they receive a large portion of the visitors ana phone calls, AIL
of the five consnlar officers in the Soviet Enbassy are known or pce
intelligence officers. Certainly if OSWALD bad been a Soviet egent in

: .

training for an assassination assloment or even for sabotage work, the
Soviets would have stopped him from making open visits and phone calls to

the Eovlet Eubassy In Mexico after he tried it a couple of tines. Our



14-00000

experience in Mexico, studying the Soviet intelligsnce service at close

range, indicates that they do make sone mistakes and are sovetimes insecure —

in their methods, but that they do not persist in such glaring errors.

Some insight on the Cuban attitude toward the arrest of Silvia DURA

and the involvesent of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
gained frou two intercepted phone calls cade betveen Cuban President
Osvaldo DORFICOS ana Coben Anbassador to Mexico Joaquin HERUATURY Armas oa
26 ctovenber 1963, the day after Silvia DURAN was released from her first
arrest. At 09:40 AM that morning, Eresident DORTICOS phoned the Aubassador
frou Havana and asked him several questions about a report which the
Sobassagor had cent dn on the arrest of Silvia DURAN ana the Lee OSWALD
case. ‘he whole conversation is consistent with the theory that OSWALD
uerely vauted a visa. ‘he Anbassador dia mention the altercation which

Silvis DURAN's arma a Little shaking her to impress her with the importance

of their questions. They had asked ber if she haa been intingte with

OSWALD end she had denied it. President DORTICOS twice asked Aubassaaor


14-00000

TSRNANDSZ whether the Mexican police had asked Silvia DURAN questions
about “money,” and the President apparently wanted to know vhether the

Mexicans thought the Cubans hed paid CSWALD money. [ISRAAMDEZ insisted

‘the Mexicana kad not offered Silvia DURAN money, and DORTICOS gave
up trying to put across bis point, President DORTICOS instructed
EERSANDEZ to keep on questioning Silvia DURAN and to phone him back.

At 7:39 PM that evening Ambassador HSRNANDSZ dia call President
DORTICOS pack, saying he bad questioned "that person” asain ana ske has
nothing nev to add, President DORTICGS returns to the iss of whether
“they had threatened her so that she vould make a statement that the
Consulate bed glvea noney to the manti"that Asertean.” ut Aubaasador
eR persists in misunierstanding DORPICOS, ansyen in the negative,
and says: "Absolutely nothing was given to her.” DORTICOS seems to give

Up, and the conversation dies out efter a few more general remarks.

We do not know for sure what mode President DORTICOS press for informa-

City with about $5,000. Perhaps DORTICOS was trying to learn whether
the Mexican police believed that the Cubans had financed CSWALD. In any
event, the Cuban Goverment sent the Mexicans a stiff note of protest
over the arrest and detention of Silvia DURAN, but the Mexctcans

rejected the note.
