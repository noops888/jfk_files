Signed: Calvin Hicks wH/4/pM/operations

“Rey is balieved to have accomplished pratically nothing towards the effort
to overthow Castro. Instead, it seems that whenever we played with his so-
called assets, we were burned. He is notorious for claiming assets or
operations, several days after some other group had already set them up or
cleimed them. Whenever it came to producing and backing up his claims, he
always came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has
always tended to try to take over other goups, rather than cooperate with
them, and when he couldn't take them over he would "politic" against them.
His actions all seemed to be directed toward making him the future power
in Cuba rather than toward overthrowing Castro. It is believed that Manolo
RAY is so far "left" in his thinking that he would be as dangerous (or more
so in the long run) to United States interests as Castro, if he ever got to
be the power in Cuba.”

1. Cable to JMWAVE from Director
Date: August 1, 1961

FBI conducting investigation on MRP and Ray and Director indicates he
needs to know purpose of investigation to respond properly.

2. Dispatch from Chief of Base, JMWAVE
Date: August 4, 1961
Subject: Debriefing of Father Bastarrica

Father Bastarrica recently arrived from Cuba as a political exile. At a?
luncheon meeting, he reported as follows: :
MRP formed in Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amalio Fiallo
Gonzalez, Dr. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera.
All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica. The name of MRP
was suggested by Raul Chibas and in itself it does not constitute a party
or group but rather a coalition of several small groups, which were the
following:

a. The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray

b. Accion Democratica, led by Dr. Fiallo

¢c. Accion Verde Olivo, led by Dr. Rufo Lopez Fresquet

d. 30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)

e. Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos

f. Dr. Valdez Pino, in asylum in Babassy of Peru and belonged

a to accion Democratica.

Father Bastarrica's opinion of Ray is that he had no way of judging whether
Ray is Commmist or Marxist. Lacks quality of leadership because he
does not publically hold to a definite political, social and economic ideology.
He appears to agree with every person he talks to, never arguing with them
or opposing them, all of which shows he has no ideology and makes him a
very dangerous man. Is extremely anbitous for himself, with great desire
for power.

3. Memorandum for Chief, WH Division, dated 10 October 1961, from Warren S.

activity by Ray, urge every effort to check accuracy of AvMTauP/AMOT reporting

Origin of Autonomous Operations

Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by Higher Authority
in June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups
to supplement and assist in the execution" of other courses of action.
Concept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 in Walter Rostow's proposal for a
“Track Two" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-
controlled Cuban teams, CIA wohld extend financial aid and some advice and
guidance to independent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement incorporated into June 1963 program.

1. "It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be
executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the
overthrow of the Castro/Commnist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,
both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance. a

2. The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost
in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations
can be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted,
they cannot be resumed.

3. All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory
of the United States.

4, ‘The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly

i any participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurate may
be the reports of Us S. complicity.

5. Whe United States presence and direct participation in the
operation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into an

Fe] operational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make it
clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except
to counter intervention by the Soviets. An experienced CIA officer would be
assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide
general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support.
He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations.

6. ‘These operations would not be undertaken within a fixed time
schedule."

alts ‘ticle from New York Times, Wednesday, July 15, 1964, bylined Tad Szulc
"Ray Said To Leave For Cuba Landing - Castro Foe, Balked in May, Reported
on Way Again."

5. Cable to DIR from JMBARR, dtd 15 Jul 1964. M/V true with Manolo Ray

4, Memo for the Record, dtd 11 Sept 1964 from Alfonso Rodreguez

On Aug 2h, 1954, Rogelio Cisneros called to report his resignation from JURE.
Stated Ray incapable of directing both political and military activities.
Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not
prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray had
believed he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba. "Ray is politically
uMpnformed --- politically that which he last read". Cisneros further stated
that he believed Ray had planned his entire return-to-Cuba angle with President
Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. According to
him, Ray planned to make JURE and Ray outstanding . liberal and democractic
exile group with the thought that prior to the 1964 elections, Mr. Kennedy
would have to do something about Cuba. With Kennedy's death, according to
Cisneros, all of Ray's plans went awry. Rodriguez expresses to Cisneros
that this seems like a far-fetched possibility and Cisneros admits he got
idea out of thin air, but said theory widely held within Directorate of JURE.

5. Memo for the Record ~ draft - dtd 22-Sept 1964 ~ alfonso Rodriguez
Conclusions "I recommend we give Ray wnat he asks and close the JURE books
for good. Tf Ray is succesful in Cuba he will not need our help, if he is
not, our help won't do much good.

"He is honest and at least the money will lergely be spent for the
purpose he wants to achief . ©

"vhatever Ray may ever say, he was treated the way he asked to be
treated. We have played the same in a manner beyond reproach."

A friend of his reports plans to assassinate top Castro leadership in Cuba.
To be done by poison -- "Clostridium Botulinum" which is strong, odorless,
and tasteless. Takes about 12 days to kill. About 5ce would do the job.
Waiting for next visit of major delegation from a Communist country --

15. 11/17/6005cable to Director from MASH

On 11/15/60, alias Bender met with Ray in complete privacy.
"Unquestionably, the youthful, softspoken, unassuming, almost humie Ray

is a natural leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity and convistion."
Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is
concerned.

Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban extles
unified in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 19$0
constitution. Provisional govermmant of 30 honorable Cubans would be
established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passed
at beginning of his regime to be promigated. State would regulate

private investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" -- each member to have specific
responsibilities and feel important to revolution. :

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also
asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday -- Bender made commitment.

eee net result of meeting was establishment of private MRP-
U.S. link and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.
Ray. agrees.to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being
supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem
to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of
the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained is
problematical.

Consensus was that Ray did not politically represent amgthing to cheer

control MRP and wean it away to the extent possible from its leaders.
Could be done by controlling financial and military support. It was
agreed in meeting with Mr. Barnes that finencial and military support

Subject: Manolo Ray Rivero .

“Ray has indicated to WAVE sources that whereas he is not persona grata
with the Agency, he has important political connections in Washington and
is thus kept informed of much of the Agency's activities. Ray's new
organization is not to be military or engage in military thrusts against
Cube because military activity is presently controlled by the Agency and
cannot be wrested from it at this time. Ray's new organization will
cooperate with the Consejo and attempt to move in on it with the ultimate
aim of taking over and dominating it."

from persons close to Ray and their views are complete reliable. Ray did
not leave Castro's cabinet because of ideological or policy discrepancies
with Castro but because of a heated discussion with the Minister of Labor.
Martinez Sanchez, who almost shot Ray after a Cabinet meeting. ‘The sources
of information agree t Ray is not eny different than Castro. Some of
them believe he may not have completely severed his relations with Castro
and think he may still be in contact with him. Diplomatic relations were

bad as it is claimed to be."

8. Report on visit with Ray in Puerto Rico during first week of

June, 1962, submitted by Winterrowd through Walt Raymond. Winterrowl
