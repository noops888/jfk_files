5. {Seeret- PG) LIAISON Received a telephone call from
Peter Stockton, on the staff of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power,
House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Mr, Stockton
wished to inquire as to whether we had received and understood a recent
letter on NUMEC from Chairman John D. Dingell (D., Mich.). I told :
him that I had and informed him of the arrangements we projected for i
briefings. There ensued a long discussion as to Mr. Stockton's
preferences for the mode of briefing, which I informed him I could not
guarantee, It was left that I would check with the appropriate CIA
element, and inform Mr. Stockton of the results when I had them.

Chief Counsel, and Staff Director, House Select Committee 07
Assassinations, tomake arrangements for staff personnel to revie
