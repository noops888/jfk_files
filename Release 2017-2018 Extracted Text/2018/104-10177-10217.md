: : Branch pulls down their dianer trays and spreads out
3 pife of notes and news clippings. Then he pulls out a
police mug shot. "Meet Orlundo Bosch.” he suys.

Rothchild stares incredulously at a porcine Cuban
fan with a thin moustache and thick lips “He looks
like the headmaster of a military school.”

“L know,” Branch says, "but he's a killer. He's'also
a pediatrician. This.whole thing’s like that—yin and

readiness, “Boach went underground two years after -
