3. During review of CAIN's Security file, I noted 2 message
regarding kim from Mexico City, on 25 April 1942, which mentioned
a"Willard '@ ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,"
who obvicusly had had contact of some kind with CAIN, 2s well as with
a CIA representative in Mexico to whom ANDREWS had commented that : }
CAIN claims to have been with OSS during W. W. Il (Acopy of this memo-= eee
yandum is attached). In answer to this message which requested traces
on CAIN, Headquarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard. ; 4
ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS, nor a claim! }
he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be substentiated. The
Station was advised that he did have (or had had) a legitimate detective
laboratory in Chicago.

. 5. The firsttime CAIN came to the attention of the Security Otlike
was when the Mexico Station requested traces on him. Their xequest
stemmed from an unannounced visit he made to the Station, during which
he stated that he had an investigative agency in Mexico with branches i in
Ghicago and Los Angeles. He had also stated that his agency in Mexico
was for the purpose of training Mexican Government agents in police
methods, in investigative techniques, and in the use of the lie detector;
and had added that he was investigeting Communism in a certain unnamed
Gentral American country,

6. Yn June 1962, the Mexico Station advised that CAIN was being
deported by the Mexican Ministry (of) Gobernacion for these violations:
