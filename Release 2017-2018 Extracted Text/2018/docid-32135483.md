Enclosed LHM has been classified "Confidential"
because it contains information from the above sources of the
FBI, It is felt the unauthorized disclosure of information
attributed to these sources could possibly compromise them
and thus be injurious to the national defense,

The pretext telephone calls on 9/9/64 and 9/28/64
were conducted by SA RONALD E, YOUNG to the Citizens'
Committee of Inquiry, 156 Fifth Avenue, NYC, under the
guise of a person interested in LANE's defense of LEE HARVEY

JALD,

Two copies of this communication are being furnished
to the Dallas Division in view of their interest in this
matter.

Investigation continuing at New York,
