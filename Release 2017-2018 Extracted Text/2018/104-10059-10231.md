SUBJECT: James A. Everett’). 0) 0 Ue Ig een

Ay. Evereit met t with the IG and the case orga for over an hous :
and a haif yesterday afternoon. He was separated from thé Agency, asa
Staff Agent, in,June 1973, and now, seeks a review of that action.:

‘

2. Everett stated that he served fox (outeen years with ‘the :

Agency,” starting, with CT training in 1959, He joined the » Agency ..

tex 8-1/2" years in the ministry, and was "clean" for purposes’ of
deep cover. He served always under. cover, “and the meeting with: us
was the first time he ever had been in the Headquarters Building. *
He had spent four years in Norway, and spoke the Janguage, which
he felt made him a natural for his original. choice of deep « cover," ” :
which he now thinks may have been wrong. . ‘

3. Everett states’ that he ¥ was with the Agency in Swéden for”

7 years - 1960-67 - first under cover with an export-import firm |
based in New York The,last three to three and a half years were
with Robert R. Mullen & Co. He says hef#4$ the number two man
in LPGLOBE,) which he understands has since been incorporated-
into. CCS, He retained his cover in Mullen (which was two blocks

: away from the CPGLOBE offices), being responsible for the Africa :
area, Then he went to the Netherlands for four. years; he doubted ~
the viability of that assignment, yet there were four. people there i
without enough to do.

4.° Two things happened. First there was the Western ‘”
Hemisphere flap, related to the Agee case, He had been a CT
classmate of Agee's, although they were in different parts of the \:
@ivided class. He knew Agee, having a casual but familiar association :
with him dering training. He says Agee has a phenomenal memory.’ _
He has not seen Agee since training. -_ says that Agee was Kirdschi's
. ease officer in Mexico City, when Kh was under Mullen cover,
"and that Agee listed Kindschiyin a book ‘Ages has written, reporting

“avas not mentioned in Agee's, book, bat’ it raised a further question |
about his exposure to Agee. Bees

Bverett returned to Wash on 17 June 1972--he noted the
: irony of the date, being the one-of th Watergate arrests. He met
es Howard Hunt (for the. first time). on 19. June at ‘the Mullen office, at
which Hunt met him like a long.lost brother,. baséd on his own earlier
CIA: employment. Now théy were both vice presidents of the same °
company. The window of the office was across the street from that
of the.office of headquarters of the Committee to Re-elect the President. -
Everett commented that they must be uneasy "over there, “and | i
cormmented on the stupidity of what had been’ done in view of the’ovex- :
‘whelming. strength of the President. ..He could see something like that
happening in 1937 (sic), when theré was the issue of peace, Hunt did
not comment, but in about 2 half hour theré was.a phone call “indicating
that the police had a lead, Hunt ex¢laimed, "My God, no!" and left.
They met.on the street shortly. thereafter, but Hunt didn't even see
him he was so preoccupied. He returned” to the office and left’ again
and Everett never saw him again. Everett observed that his association
with Hunt , although clean, was another weakness in his cover. His
‘cover, which haa been strong was now gone," Now. deep. cover was -
exer s| for: x him, and the ave estion became what to do. a

6. “At this point Everett gave His personal view that an intelli-
: gence oxrgenization has special responsibilities towards its employees.
_ “If it doesn't react with integrity towards its employees--that will be

the death of it.'! . sues : ae

_, Describing it as a shattezing experience for the Agency,.he saw it
as affecting the Agency's ability to adjust to its responsibilities.

He {Everett} had loc for another line of work in the Agency, and

fmmaliy found a place in DO Division {although it has become FR

says he did not have a “signature on paper, '! but he considered it

8s ona seltlement: |
() Everett could not use his former.Agency poole seeat asa reference
<2) he could not use his former Mullen association as a refer ence, and
{3) he could not seek employment on the East coast. He-would be paid ag
a year's salary, wth taxes deductible. Everett said he could not -

accept the offer. He was an executive who would have to seck employ—

ment with no record of what he had done for the past fourteen years,

Beckman was quoted as seying itis "the best anybody’ s bil offered."

i “g, Everett talkea. with Millen, | who he said was shocked. 2
Mullen had helped Bissell, and had done more for the Agency than.
many in it,:arid could not understand this approach, Beckman .”.
(2pparently) off-set this reaction with statements of the Agency’ $
authority to hire and fire, and told him of the lack of success ae
eleven who had. taken the issue, to court.

paige Ei jerett warited a ie sum payment, unaccountable, and
in a few day3.° 15 July was the deadline. "They" returned on 15 July
and said OK, but on 30 July they. said the payment would haye to be
taxed. This meant an extra $5,000 out of his pocket. Everett then
cited some $18-19, 000 for his salary, plus some $10,800 from his
retirement and accumulated leave. He did not complete summarizing
all the details.." He said they tried their best to go back and. re-
calculate .the past five years to help on the tax, -and the Agency is
responsible for doing the tax "this year. and until the taxes level off."

7 : 10. .Everett said he had talked with Pete Wheelex at the time
who was incensed, and who said "we'll get you something," and "tas



ong as Iam in this Agency you will have a job. ''. This was in June-
July 1973, and Wheeler "fought it up to and including Schlesinger."'.
Everett said his record was. superior--he had never been in a flap,
: although he had takén over people's flaps, he had never had a money
problem, he had wever raped a secretary, while others who had-
vroblems. staved on. Waceler argued £if acid had been throws in
his. face he would have been retized on medical disability, and that
“now he suffered a sécuriiy disability which, for our Agency, was just
as much a disability, and he should be retired with an annuity. “Wheeler
qucted SchleSinger to Everett as dismissing it out of hand, and Colby
‘as not,wanting to touch it.. Wheeler said he had no where else to go,
and it was s. finel. Everett then went t to Mullen.

en dy Mallen then undertook to take on the responsibility, although
it was not his. ~He said there would be ncthing for 1973, bet that then
he could expect $25,000. a year, followed by $35,000.. Unfortunately

. Watergate hasnot gone away~-it has been hammer, hammer, hammer.
Innocent people have been hurt, and Mullen has lost business because
of it. .The largest account has been lost, for Rehabilitation of the
Handicapped at $98,000 a year. He also named General Foods to the

: tune of $50-60, 000 a year, the Mormon Church and International

. Rotary Club.” Mullen sold out to Robert Bennett, to be paid $150, ooo,

: bat in view of what has happened to the company he has waived the
payment.:. Everett still wants to stay with Bennett, but Bennett is.
