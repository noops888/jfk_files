NEMORANIUM FOR: Chief, Covert Action Steff
SUBIECT : Bivart G. Tichborn (P)

le On lL May I contacted TMchborn (P) in Los Angeles. Following
the suggestion that Mr. Collins had made, I queried him as to his
availability to work with some of our Cubans. I pointed out to him
that there was a Cuban goverment in exile forming end that we were
trying to keep tabs on it and hoped to be able to steer it along
lines which we thought to be in the best interest to the United
States. In this connection I sefd that we hed a Horth American |
who was more or less handling the operation and trying to guide then
as best he could, hovever, ve felt that it might be highly desirable
to interject him into the picture because of bis background and
language capability. I went cn to point out to him that it vas
obviously an extremely dirficult task to get the Castro opposition
to agree to one coordinated program, etc. I told-him that it was
our hope that if a government in exile were formed, it would include
all segments of the Castro opposition and that w= were pulling
strings to sea to it that it was not formed in the United States. I
told TMchborn (P) that we did not envisage that he would have to work
perwanently with this group but rather that he would be availoble
from time to time to discuss with then and to act ss an auditor of
their problens as well as-a mentor in their operation, ete.

2. Tichborn (P) said that he would be very glad to do this for
us and thought ha would be able to find the time, The only question
that aroze in his mird was the fact that he will soon be actively
engaged in the Bemocratic campaign, perhaps on a full time basis.
â€˜This obviously raises a security problem as if it vere to become mown
that We were vorking with the Castre opposition, it might reflect
unfavorable on whoever he was supporting politically in this country.
It was left that he would give some serious thought to this problem
end let me know as soon as he made up his mind definitely one way or
the other whether he would be villing and available to work with the
government in exile on a spot basis from time to time.
