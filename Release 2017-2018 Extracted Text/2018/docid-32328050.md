Letter Novemir 14, 1955.

PCI NORMAN ROTHMAN, On December 6,

1955,

Sans Souci Night Club and Gambling Casino is goingeto be

Referenced Miami letter sets forth information to the

effect that WILLIAM GUSTOBISCHOFF, alias Lefty Clark,

FBI #1721507, is going to operate the sans souch during

the coming

season.

ROTHMAN advised that although he was still managing the

Sans Souci, it was doubtful that he would be connected

with that place after the opening which is scheduled for

December 26, 1955.

He said he was leaving because of

differences

having with people who have an interest

in the Sans Souci and also officials of the Cuban Govern

ment who control the issuance of licenses to gambling

establishments ROTHMAN did not identify any of these

individuals by name but it was noted that during the inter-

VIeW OSCAR, ECHEMENDIA, who along with MARTIN FOX is one of

the owners of the Tropicana Night Club, arrived at the

Sans Souch with a locksmith to open the safe.

explained the above incident by saying that the combination

to the safe had been lost and that the locksmith had been

caned to open the door of the safe and to re-set the

combination.

In connection with his remark that he was not getting

along with Cuban Government officials, ROTHMAN added that

the Sans Souci has always paid big "shake money" considering

the fact it was only open during the winter season.

stated that he paid out more money for police protection

for

the season than

either the Tropicana or Montmartre pays

ROTHMAN stated that in connection with the proposed new

gambling casinos in havana, many investors have been ted to

believe that the government was interested in opening these

places in order to attract tourist trade to Cuba, He ex-

plained that after large amounts of money were spent in

planning these places and buying and installing equipment,

the government then assessed each place that wanted to open

a large "donation"

in addition to the $25, 000.00 license fee.

ROTHMAN added that the new casino at the Hotel Nacional had

originally been assessed $100

$25,000 and $50,000. 880w

ROTAMAN added that plans for opening a gambling casino in the

Hotel Comodoro have been dropped for the present because of

the prohibitive amount of graft which would have to be paid

in connection with obtaining a license (E)e

He

said that the Atlantic Hotel, on First Avenue in Miramar,

Havana, had also planned to open a gambling casino which was

to be

called the Copa, or Copacabana. ROTHMAN stated that

extensive alterations

and repairs have been undertaken at the

hotel in order

to house

the gambling casino. He pointed out

that the hotel will now have to pay the extra graft for the

license or lose the money already invested in the alterations.

ROTHMAN said he did not know the plans involved in this

trans

action nor did he know the identity

of the person who allegedly

It was noted on Dec. 6,

that the alterations and remodeling at the Atlantic

Hotel, as described by fOrMAN, are being i

undertaken.(s)~

Mr. H. Lindsay/Gatty,

who on December 1

as

assistant manager at the Hotel Nacional, advised on December 9,

1955, that the

Sans Souci is presently

owned by Tropicana in-

terests and that through arrangements with government officials

a permit has been granted to open Sans Souci on December 26,

1955°

Gatty advised it is his belief that the Sans Souch has

not had a license to operate since the time ROTHMAN took it

over but has only been allowed to run because of the heavy

graft it affords the cuban police.
