Sans Souci, it was doubtful that he would be connected
with that place after the opening which is scheduled for
December 26, 1955. He said he was leaving because of
differences he is having with people who have an interest
in the Sans Souci and also officials of the Cuban Govern-

ROTHMAN stated that in connection with the proposed new

gambling casinos in Havana, many investors have been led to
believe that the government was interested in opening these
places in order to attract tourist trade to Cuba, He ex-
plained that after large amounts of money were spent in
planning these places and buying and installing equipment,
the government then assessed each place that wanted to open
a large "donation" in addition to the $25,000.00 license fee,
ROTHMAN added that the new casino at the Hotel Nacional had
originally been assessed $100,000 in addition to the license
fee but that this figure had jater been lowered to between
$25,000 and $50,000. PO a~

ROTIMAN added that plans for opening a gambling casino in the
Hotel Comodoro have been dropped for the present because of
the prohibitive amount of graft which would have to be paid
in connection with obtaining a license. 4%) y

He said that the Atlantic Hotel, on First Avenue in Miramar,
Havana, had also planned to open a gambling casino which was
to be called the Copa, or Copacabana, ROTHMAN stated that
extensive alterations and repairs have been undertaken at the
hotel in order to house the gambling casino, He pointed out
that the hotel will now have to pay the extra graft for the
license or lose the money already invested in the alterations,
ROTHMAN said he did not know the plans involved in this trans-
action nor did he know the identity of the person who allegedly
was to run the Copa Gambling Casino, It was noted on Dec. 6,
1955, that the alterations and remodeling at the Atlantic
Hotel, as described by ROTHMAN , are being undertaken. pq) ,

Mr. H, Lindsay7Gatty, who on December 1, 1955, left his position
as manager of the Sevilla-Biltmore Hotel and who is now executive
assistant manager at the Hotel Nacional, advised on December 9,
1955, that the Sans Souci is presently owned by Tropicana in-
terests and that through arrangements with government officials
a permit has been granted to open Sans Souci on December 26,
1955, Gatty advised it is his belief that the Sans Souci has
not had a license to operate since the time ROTHMAN took it

over but has only been allowed to run because of the heavy

graft it affords the Cuban police. US. ,
