ADMINISTRATIVE

A report in this matter would have been

submitted at an earlier date but due to the fact that

the writer to whom this case was assigned was temporarily

assigned to the investigation of case captioned "UNKNOWN

SUBJECT;

PAUL JOSEPH FRONCZAK - VICTIM, KIDNAPING, 00:

CHICAGO." It is to be noted, however,

that this case

has been kept in a current pending status through the

use of interoffice communications.

INFORMANTS

PCI JAMES MILTON MITCHEL advised SA JACK V.

HENDRICKS on March 9, 1964, that approximately three

weeks prior to this date ALDERISIO met him at the

pool room at the Sheridan Bowling Alley, 1007 West

Wilson, Chicago, at which time ALDERISIO requested

PCI to accompany him to Florida.. On this occasion

ALDERISIO indicated that the PCI would be well, paid

for this trip; and in addition if he should "get to

the right people," he would receive an additional sum.

PCI stated that ALDERISIO meant by the above statement

that PCI should get to "the banker, JAMES W. EGAN"

in Florida who has ALDERISIO over a barrel. PCI pointed

out that ALDERISIO did not"spell it out" but meant that

some force should be used against EGAN such as breaking

an arm or leg, which would prevent him from testifying

against ALDERISIO.

CG 87-19740

PCI MITCHEL stated that he turned down ALDERISIO'S

request inasmuch as he is afraid to get deeply involved

with him in his activities.

PCI stated that in his

opinion ALDERISIO is a violent and viclous man who would

not permit anyone to stand in his way.

CG 6588-C-TE advised SA RUSSELL R. GIRSCH

on April 13, 1964, that ALDERISIO states that he 1s

now gathering information to assist MARSHALL CAIFANO,

not because he likes CAIFANO but to help the syndicate

win the case. ALDERISIO recently made a trip to Washington

and engaged a

WILLIAMS, BAKER's attorney,

to represent him in a Florida case.: CI stated that

while ALDERISIO was in Florida on vacation, he fired

attorney (FNU) KLEIN as he felt KLEIN was being got

to by the Government.

ALDERISIO stated that he likes

Attorney ERICKSEN who is representing him in the Denver

case.

CG 6588-C-TE stated that GEORGE I

BEIBER,

Chicago attorney, stated that ERICKSEN told him

that

the first attorney ALDERISIO hired or tried to hire

refused to represent ALDERISIO after ALDERISIO told him

that if he lost the case he would take care of the

United States Attorney who prosecuted the case..

CG 6588-C-TE stated that he heard IRWIN WEINER

instruct MAX LURIE, a Florida attorney, to send all

copies of papers pertaining to ALDERISIO's case to

Chicago Attorney GEORGE BEIBER.

CG 6588-C-TE stated that ALDERISIO advised

that he had received a telephone call from OBBIE (probably

AARON OBERLANDER) who is in Florida.

OBERLANDER stated

that he had found some good information to aid PHIL'S

defense.

ALDERISIO expressed doubt to this stating that

OBBIE was probably just trying to get more money from

him.
