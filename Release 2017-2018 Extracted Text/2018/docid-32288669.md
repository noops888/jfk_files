weeks prior to this date ALDERISIO met him at the
pool room at the Sheridan Bowling Alley, 1007 West
Wilson, Chicago, at which time ALDERISIO requested
PCI to accompany him to Florida..On this occasion
ALDERISIO indicated that the PCI would be well, paid ~
for this trip;and in addition if he should "get to
the right people," he would receive an additional sum.
PCI stated that ALDERISIO meant by the above statement
that PCI should get to "the banker, JAMES W. EGAN"
in Florida who has ALDERISIO' over a barrel. MWCI pointed
out that ALDERISIO did not"spell it out" but meant that
some force should be used against EGAN such as breaking
an arm or leg, which would prevent him. from testifying
against ALDERISIO.

and engaged a WILLIAMS, BAKER's attorney,
to represent him In a Florida case.. CI stated that
while ALDERISIO was in Florida on vacation, he fired
attorney (FNU) KLEIN ‘as he felt KLEIN was being got ~
to by the Government. ALDERISIO stated that he likes
Attorney ERICKSEN who is representing him in the Denver
case.

CG 6588-C-TE stated that GEORGE BEIBER,
Chicago attorney, stated that ERICKSEN told him that
the first attorney ALDERISIO hired or tried to hire

United States Attorney who prosecuted the case.

CG 6588-C-TE stated that he heard IRWIN WEINER
instruct MAX LURIE, a Florida attorney, to send all
copies of papers pertaining to ALDERISIO's case to
Chicago Attorney GEORGE BEIBER.

CG 6588-C-TE stated that ALDERISIO. advised
that he had received a telephone call from OBBIE (probably
AARON OBERLANDER) who is in Florida. OBERLANDER stated
that he had found some good information to aid PHIL's
defense. ALDERISIO expressed doubt to this stating that
OBBIE was probably just trying to get more money from
hin. |
