Fitzgerald. The FBI did conduct an internal security-type
investigation of Nunez-Toro in 1965 as a result of his
reported disaffection for the United States while living
abroad. [ie reopened that investigation in 1969 when it was
reported that Nunez-Toro communicated with the Cuban Embassy, “

a meeting was held between representatives of the FBI (SAs
- Paul Bs’ Daly and John Thomas), representatives of the Senate
Select Committee (John T. E11iff£, Task Force head of the Domestic
Task Force, Mark Gitenstein) and Michael Shaheen of the Department.
At this meeting Mr. Shaheen advised that the proposed procedures
concerning the handlings of requests for documents by the Senate
Select Committee had been approved by the ‘Attorney General and in
the Senate Select Committee. (A copy is attached.)

Shaheen and E1liff indicated the purpose in meeting on
the 25th along with an anticipated meeting on Monday,. 7/28/75, was
to assist the SSC in the planning of a superseding request in
accordance with ‘the newly established procedures concerning
document ‘requests. Both Shaheen and EL1iff expressed concern at
this time that the schedules set forth in the new agreement was
such that in many instances the Bureau would not be able to
respond in time to meet ‘the deadlines. Additionally, Shaheen
lexpressed concern that the provisions require that the Attorney /
General adjudicate any question as to the necessity of furnishing 5a

24,

ja document ‘to. the Committee and to make such a decision within
hours would be very burdensome. ~

Messrs. ELLiff and Shaheen were advised by SA Daly te
this would be true, pointing out that in many instances files are
not readily available because of. FOIA requests, needs of the anes
Bureau's ongoing investigations and law suits in which it was
necessary to. view particular files. It was also pointed out that
many of the requests of the Senate Select Committee necessitate
the review of a number of files and/or numerous. volumes of a
particular file all of which are not necessarily available
immediately. Mr. Shaheen advised that it was the Attorney
General's desire that Senate Select Committee requests take
precedence over all other matters including the Freedom of In-
formation. It was pointed out to Mr. Shaheen that our responses

to Freedom of Inform tion Act are under deddline by law bile

RE: SENSTUDY 1975

this were to be the Attorney General's feelings, he should

advise this Bureau in writing so that we would be in a i”
position to use this statement of policy should this
question arise during litigation. It was pointed out that
in many areas of possible abuse set forth by the Senate
Select Committee we have pending FOIA requests and/or
litigation which require the availability of those files
for responses.

E1Lif£ indicated that it was the Committee's. desire
in their forthcoming superseding request to request material
[that had been previously furnished the-Committee with the under-
standing that there would be less excisions made in compliance
with the new agreement. He inquired as to whether the Bureau
_ could advise him as to what material previously furnished was
readily retrievable and could be furnished in accordance with
anew request. He was advised by SAs Daly and Thomas that it was
not possible at this time to give him a response, however, we would
endeavor to make an analysis of prior requests to obtain this in-
formation and have it available for the meeting Monday, 7/28/75.

A general discussion was had concerning the new agree-
ment especially concerning the type of material which might
properly be excised and third agency problems. It was generally
agreed upon that not only the identity of informants be excised
‘put also information which might disctose thé ideiitity of infor-
mants might also be properly excised. ~ ELLiff indicated that the
Committee did not wish to see many items referred to the Attorney
General as is called for by the agreement for his. decision and
would rather at least on a preliminary basis where it was a
question of the propriety of the excision that the discussion
be. held with BS*or one of his representatives before such a
referral was made. Shaheen also indicated a desire that the
‘referrals to the Attorney General be kept to a minimum. Regard-
ing the "Third Agency" problems which are not addressed in the
agreement ‘there was no final decision arrived at. E1Liff and
Shaheen were. under the impression that the clauses referring
to foreign intelligence operations or foreign intelligence
sources would handle this problem. They were advised that
this was not the case. This was not true since even in
these instances Senators on the Committee are given access
after the Attorney General has made a determination that
material involved "pecularily sensitive foreign intelli-

}gence sources or pecularily sensitive ongoing foreign

intelligence operations." It was pointed out ‘that ‘this "
would require that many. documents. be referred to. the”

Attorney General for. his. determination which would be
contrary. to. Messrs. ELLiff's and Shaheen 's desires. >

The meeting was. held 7/28/75, Messrs. Gitenstein and
E1L1Lif£ of the Committee, Michael Shaheen and Steven K.. Blackhurst -
of the Departmerit, and SAs Paul’ V. Daly, Seymor Phillips and Elmer
Larson were in attendance. Regarding the "Third Agency" rule
| problem, we advised the Department and the Committee that we°
would’ continue to’ abide by this rule. . Thé Committeé presented
a request. dated July 28, 1975, captioned "Superseding Request
for FBI Materials." This document ‘amounted to a xecapitulation
of prior requests made by. the Committée with ‘a schedule for
delivery set forth in accordance with ‘the established guidelines
for the production of documents. An item-by-iteni analysis of the
‘ xéquest ‘contained in the ‘document was ‘had and where necessary
modifications. concerning scheduled responses was made. It was
obvious the intent ‘of the Committed in’ making the ‘superseding
tequést was. to. have more documents made available in the Commit~
tee offices and also to. have less. excisions made on documents.
previously furnished the Committee based on prior requests. We
were requested by Shaheen to prepare as soon as possible cor-
xrespondence ‘to the Attorney General setting forth instances where
the deadlines set by the Committee could not be made. This prompted
the provisions in the guidelines, for the production of documents
which require the Attorney General to notify the Committee Chair-

Intelligence Division has requested the Administrative Division to
review Sections 10 and 12 (copies attached) of the Manual of Rules and
Regulations for any possible excisions or problems in furnishing this
material to the committee and to furnish the results of the review to Legal.
Counsel, attention Dennis R. Dickson.

Section 10, pertaining to Appeals and Grievances, and Section 12,
Transfers-Resignations, have been reviewed and no problems can be foreseen
and no excisions are necessary. In this regard, it is noted that Part I,

Section 10, Appeals and Grievances, needs to be revised to set forth the
current appeal rights of nonveterans. Attached is memorandum recommending
a Manual revision be approved pointing out that under current procedure,
final action in disciplinary matters involving cases of nonveterans up to and
including dismissal is taken by the Assistant Director, Administrative ;
Division, with the employee having the right to appeal this action to the
Director.

There was some question under Section 12 dealing with transfers to
foreign assignments wherein it is set out that Chief Clerks should be afforded
training in maintenance, consolidation, and destruction of files, whether this
information should be furnished. This was discussed with Deputy Assistant
Director, Homer R. Hauer, Files and Communications Division, who advised
there is nothing objectionable to this reference regarding destruction of files
and the reference of same need not be excised.

Under Section 12, dealing with foreign assignments, information is
set out regarding people being transferred to such assignments receiving
training on coding equipment, the AFSAM-7. This was questioned as to
whether it should be excised. Alvin C. Frank, Section Chief, Communications

; Section, advised this information need not be excised as the mere referer

* *Memorandum. Burns to Walsh
Re: Senate Select Committee

It should also be noted that certain Manual changes are being
recommended in connection with Section 12, in relation to absences for
maternity purposes. In Section 12, page 10, we are recommending that
the phrase "absence for maternity reasons" be used in all instances where
we have previously used the phrase ''maternity leave.'' These recommended
revisions have already been approved and are being processed. In
Section 12, page 8, we are recommending a revision indicating that
employees resigning for maternity purposes can utilize accrued sick leave
during their period of incapacitation and are not setting out specific time
elements as previously utilized. Memorandum is attached recommending
this change.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum be furnished to Intelligence Division,
with three copies to Legal Counsel Division, setting forth that the
Administrative Division has no objection to the material set out in -
Sections 10 and 12, including proposed revisions, of the Manual of Rules
and Regulations being referred for review i

INTERVIEW OF SA WALLACE E, WARD
BY SSC_STAFF MEMBER

On August 51925, Special Agent (SA) Wallace E E.
Ward.was interviewed by SSG Staff Member Lester Seidel at
Tos Angeles Headquarters regarding Cointelpro/Black Panther
Party. The interview lasted from 9:12 a.m., to 9:22 a.m.

Seidel asked how long SA Ward has been a
Special Agent with the FBI, and SA Ward responded nine
years. He further requested previous offices SA Ward
had been assigned to, and SA Ward responded Cincinnati,
Ohio. Seidel advised the Bureau informed him that SA Ward
had been assigned Cointelpro/Black Panther Party in June,
1969. Seidel requested to know what work SA Ward had been
assigned before this, to which SA Ward responded he could
| not remember, but believed general criminal work.

Seidel requested to know what specific instructions
were issued with regard to operating Cointelpro/Black
Panther Party. _SA Ward advised that due to his employment
agreement, the sensitive nature ofthe Bureau work, and
the possibte overlap of Bureau investigation, he did not

feel he could respond to any further questions. The official
interview was terminated at this point.

SA Ward was advised by Mr. Seidel that the interview
; was voluntary but SA Ward was not advised of his rights in this
: matter.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions
of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is loaned to

At the request of the Senate Select Committee aN
(SSC), we recently furnished to it superseded material dated ‘NY
back to 1960 and relating to various sections of the Manual S
of Instructions, including Section 87, In furnishing this WN
material, we did not furnish the various cover sheets NS
relating to the many revisions since 1960. S

We have received a telephonic request from
Miss Martha Talley of the SSC Staff for additional infor-
mation which would help her to better understand the various
revisions to Section 87. She also specifically desired a
copy of page 1 of that Section as it existed on 1/1/60.

We have secured the various cover sheets for the
many revisions, as well as a copy of page 1 which bears
the revision date of 8/13/56 and which, according to
Mrs. Alene T. Smith of the Training Division, was the page J
in force as of 1/1/60.

In order to comply with the request of Miss Talley,
it is not believed necessary to obtain from the SSC a ‘ (
formal, written request; neither is it believed necessary \l
to transmit the requested material by formal correspondence y XY
to the SSC through the ie General. AA

memorandum, both dated 8/7/75 and captioned "United States
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities," advised
that the Senate Select Committee (SSC) had requested the
current address of former Special Agent (SA) Thomas J. Smith
so that he may be interviewed with regard to his knowledge
concerning the "Huston Plan.'' Referenced LHM furnished the
SSC with the current address of SA Smith as 3410 Memphis Lane,
Bowie, Maryland 20715.

The note to referenced memorandum advised that an
attempt was made to telephonically contact SA Smith at the
above residence at which time it was ascertained that SA Smith
was out of town and not expected to return until sometime in
the future. A message was left for SA Smith to contact FBI 4
Headquarters upon his return. eo

On August 14, 1975, SA Smith telephonically contacted
SA Thomas J, McNiff at FBI Headquarters. SA Smith was advised
that the SSC had inquired as to his current address as they
desired to interview him with regard to his knowledge concerning
the "Huston Plan." He was advised that upon being contacted
by the SSC, he should immediately advise the Legal Counsel

answer questions, namely: information which might divulge the
identities of FBI sources; information relating to sensitive
methods and techniques; information which might adversely
affect ongoing FBI investigations and information which origi-
nated with other agencies, including foreign intelligence
agencies. Mr. Smith expressed his appreciation for the infor-

SSC, he would advise this Bureau of the date of the anticipated
interview and his decision as to whether or not he would request
that a Bureau Agent be made available for consultation.

Memorandum outlines problem area with respect to
confidentiality of FBI sources which we have encountered in
the Senate Select Committee (SSC) investigation.

Spee. Inv.

Traini
Tofephone Rm. —
Director Soc'y

In their investigation of COINTELPRO, SSC has been
given access to material from which we excised only informants
and potential informants as defined in Manual of Instructions.
When such material was requested for delivery, we have excised
identities of all individuals to whom we have incurred an
obligation to protect their identity and relationship with the
FBI. SSC has objected to these more extensive excisions in
delivered material, claiming the agreed-upon procedures do
not allow us such latitude. This was not our understanding
of the agreement,

at

As a result of this impasse, on morning of 8/8/75; we
the Director and other FBI representatives met with the
Attorney General (AG) and the Deputy Attorney General (DAG)
in an attempt to resolve the question. The AG deferred a
decision at that time pending the receipt of certain requested
information concerning the general COINTELPRO operation. Later
that date, Mr. John EL1Liff, SSC, contacted SAs William 0. Cregar
and Elmer W, Larson of the Senstudy Project, INTD, and stated
the DAG had suggested he attempt to get together with Bureau

representatives and reach some sort of compromise=orwe “=a «

who had cooperated with the FBI in the COINTELPRO operations,

be interviewed by SSC Representatives so that a more accurate
picture could be obtained concerning possible harm to
COINTELPRO targets. He indicated there was a deadline set

for completion of COINTELPRO phase of SSC investigation and
time did not allow for extensive interviews; however, he
estimated that given no deadline a maximum of 36 such contacts
would be made and,in view of the deadline, 8 to 12 interviews

of the type indicated. to be more realistic, Mr. Elliff isolated
three cases which he suggested might most easily lend themselves
to a compromise on this point and suggested they be considered
by the Bureau. If the Bureau saw fit to agree in these
instances, he suggested further deliberations be made to

select further cases in which the cooperative sources' identities
could be made available to the SSC.

SAs Cregar and Larson emphasized to E11iff that the
principle involved here was not whether or not the cooperative
source was of great and curreft value to the FBI but that the
issue was the FBI's obligation to the source to protect the
confidentiality of the relationship, While professing to
acknowledge thé”validity of the Bureau position in this regard,
ELLif£, nonetheless, was adamant in his standing that the SSC
be allowed to contact these sources without the FBI first
contacting them to ascertain their amenability to such interview.
It was stressed to ElLiff that prior contact of these sources
by the FBI would be mutually advantageous since it would
satisfy FBI obligation to the source and, if the source then
agreed to interview, would provide the SSC with a forth-coming
cooperative witness. Finally, after much discussion, E1Liff
suggested that the three cases presented by him be approved and
following this he would be willing to consider negotiation
concerning further disclosures of identifies of sources based
on FBI proposal of prior contact. The three cases proposed by
EL1iff are briefly set out below:

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

1. In 1969, an Assistant State Attorney General,
an established source of the Albuquerque Office, requested
. public source information concerning an individual in
New Mexico who was a candidate for appointment to a pollution
commission. We were able to furnish such information reflecting
the subject's affiliation with the Students for a Democratic
Society. SSC indicated they desire to interview our source,

2.° In 1966, we furnished information to a California
State Alcohol Beverage Control Commission agent that liquor
was to be sold at a political fund-raising party. SSC desires
to interview this source.

3. In 1968, the editor of a Tucson, Arizona,
newspaper contacted our resident agency in Tucson and requested
pertinent background data concerning some of the activists in
various anti-draft, anti-Vietnam and similar groups in the
Tueson area who had been receiving considerable publicity of
late. Authority was granted to furnish public source data to
the newspaper man. SSC now wishes to identify this contact
and interview him. 1

On 8/12/75, the Director was advised of the proposal
by Mr. Elliff, The Director indicated he desired to adhere to
the current policy of not divulging identity of sources with
whom the FBI has a confidential relationship; however, he
extended an invitation for Mr, E1Liff to meet with him on
8/18/75 at 4:00 p.m., for further discussion of this issue.
During the morning of 8/12/75, the Director's position and
invitation was conveyed to Mr, ELLiff by SA Cregar. Shortly
thereafter, Mr. ELLiff called back to advise that he appreciated
the invitation but that in his view-thé meeting would merely
contribute to further delay and that He planned to contact

This recommends representatives of Special and
General Investigative Divisions review material from
inspection reports which may be requested by the Senate
Select Committee (SSC) to determine whether any excisions
would be necessary before it is made available to the SSC.

By letter dated 5/14/75, the SSC, Appendix B, 4
Item I, Number 5, requested access to annual inspection a
reports and related surveys for the past 10 years with A a
respect to the Intelligence Division and 10 field offices, a
At a conference between members of the SSC Staff and ia
representatives of the Department of Justice and the FBIHQ
Senstudy staff, 5/30/75, it was agreed that in response to.
the abowe request we would make available to the SSC Staff,
for review at FBIHQ, copies of the reports of the two
inspections conducted of the Domestic Intelligence Division in 1971
and the inspection of the San Francisco Office during

October, 1970. EX 104 REC56  ,. Mb3IS- SSA

These reports have been reviewed by both the

reports are available for review in Room 4171 JEH, The LHM

determine that such material is pertinent to its mandate
by making a written request for access to it, The criminal
portions removed are attached to the tickler copies of this
memorandum designated for Messrs, Cleveland and Gallagher,

as they relate to matters within their Divisions' purview.

It has been our experience that the SSC generally does request
to see or obtain material not furnished during responses to
an initial request. Therefore, it would be prudent for
representatives of the General and Special Investigative
Divisions to, at this time, review the material attached to
Messrs, Cleveland and Gallagher's ticklers and make a
determination as to whether any excisions must be made before
review by the SSC Staff, should same be requested. Generally,
under current ground rules, only material which would identify
sensitive sources, including cooperative foreign agencies,

or violate the Third Agency Rule, may be excised. Inquiries
regarding current ground rules may be made by the Senstudy
representatives of the General and Special Investigative
Divisions of Supervisor J. P. Thomas, Room 4063 JEH,

Extension 4636.

ACTION:

It is recommended that the material attached to
the ticklers of Messrs, Cleveland and Gallagher be reviewed
as indicated above and returned to Mr. Thomas with any
necessary excisions underlined in red by 7/24/75.

the overall objéctives of the criminal informant program
are to develop high quality informants who are in a
position to furnish valuable information on a continuing
basis. : zi

Criminal desk supervisors participate in the program by
remaining alert to the necessity of having good informant
coverage in the criminal classifications which are covered
by their respective desks. The supervisor is also
required to approve any expenditure made to an informant

The supervisors also follow the Agents! activitic
this regard on an individual basis to insure that. they
are fully participating in the informant program,

2. The San Francisco.Office does have standards which
requires all Agents assigned one year or more to this
division should conform to and that is they should have
a minimum of four PCIs or one CI and two PCIs or two
CIs assigned at any one time, This, of course, is by
no means considered a maximum and many Agents
participate more fully in the program.

There are currently no first office agents assigned to
this division and when an Agent is transferred to this
division and assigned to criminal work he is expected
to show some progress by the end of sixty days and
within one year he is expected to be in Compliance
with the above standards. :

in these areas. Our informant coverage in each RA

area is considered adequate at this time and no particular
weaknesses are noted. However, efforts are made on a
continuing basis to try to improve coverage in all

areas.

It is felt that informant coverage at Headquarters City
is adequate at this time, but as indicated innumber
seven above, a continuing effort is made to improve this
coverage. iy :
Regarding the coverage provided by each criminal desk,
it is noted that as of October 12, 1970, the following
CIs and PCIs are being handled off the respective desks:

‘fhe classifications handled by the above listed desks

are set forth in question three above. 7
Administrative devices used to make certain agents are
making maximum contributions to the criminal informant
program are that the agents are followed on an individual
basis through file reviews and supervisor conferences to
insure they are meeting the criteria as set forth in
question number two above. Yhe criminal informant files
are also specifically reviewed on a semi-annually basis

“at the time the semi-annual LHlis are submitted to the
- Bureau. It is also noted files are checked at the time

they are posted on a continuing basis.

Informant files are reviewed at the end of the first
year they have been opened on an individual basis and
if they have been unproductive the agent is advised to
close the case and replace the PCI with anew one.

If the PCI has been productive the agent handling him
is advised to convert him to a criminal informant. If
it is a questionable matter it is discussed with the’
agent handling the PCI on an individual basis anda
@ecision is reached in this matter inasmuch as the
agent is in a better position to make the judgement as
to the potential of this particular PCI.

All agents in the San Francisco Division are aware of
the racial and ghetto informant program through
participation. If an agent has a case that he feels
warrants contacting of ghetto informants he will
dictate a memorandum setting forth specifically that
they should be contacted by the particular agents
handling them. ;

No actual record is kept of how much use is made of
the geographical criminal informant index. However, it
has proved Lo Le a valuable tool in inks :

the logical informants are to contact in any given
situation. This has saved many investigative hours by
making easily available to each agent the particular
type of informant coverage he might need.

All criminal informant (CI) files and a representative
number of potential criminal informant (PCI) files were reviewed
during this inspection. Following review, a memorandum
disclosing the rating afforded in each file has been forwarded

- to you for inclusion in the respective file.

Your office is currently operating 145 CIs as
compared to 141 CIs being operated at the time of the last
inspection. There is also an increase in the number of PCIs
under development at this time to 271 as opposed to 250 under
development during the last inspection. These figures do not
include Top Echelon informants or targets for development
which are commented on separately under the Criminal Intelligence
Program. This represents a slight increase in the number of
CIs and a more substantial increase in the number of PCIs
under development. However, there is a slight decrease in
two large metropolitan areas, namely, San Francisco and Oakland,

. Which though slight represents a static situation as to

- increasing coverage in these areas. The Oakland Resident
Agency has also recorded a decrease in the number of PCIs
,under development. In analyzing the coverage in the resident
agencies, it was noted that Monterey, Richmond and San Jose
have the same coverage from CIs as during the last inspection
although Monterey and San Jose have shown a substantial
increase in the number of PCIs being handled. PCIs under.
Gevelopment in Salinas and San Rafael are down somewhat,
although this too in part is off-set by the increase in the
number of CIs being operated. In view of the Bureau's
increased responsibilities, it is absolutely essential that
a strong criminal informant program be maintained .and in

i é fact expanded if the Bureau is to meet these increased

responsibilities.

All of the CI files were reviewed during this

inspection and the following ratings were given to the CIs
presently being operated by this office:

information principally as a result of his employment in
the U.S. Army, Personnel Center, Oakland, California Army
Base, this informant should be discontinued as a CI and
converted to a Confidential Source. SF 2290-C was recently
reopened on the basis of having provided a service to
Pepartment of Justice attorneys and the Bureau but has furnished
no criminal information for an extended period of time and
had been in a closed status since 3/10/69. This informant
should also be discontinued as a CI and considered as a
Confidential Source. You should appropriately advise the
Bureau that this action has been taken.

The following informants have been rated Fair and
they should be given specific assignments for a period of
90 days in an attempt to improve their productivity. At
the end of that period of time you should advise the Bureau
of reasons for continuing them as informants or that they

AGENT PARTICIPATION \
You have indicated Special Agents JAMES P. 4AL.0¥,
CARLTON H. ‘WOLFARTH and GARY N. MAVITY have spent 50%'or
more of their time on criminal type investigative matters
during thepast year but do not currently have assigned a
qualified CI personally developed by them. Further comment
is being set forth later in this addendum concerning these
Agents. 7 : aan -

PAYMENTS : an Peer

A review of payments indicates that your office
paid an average of $1,473.98 a month to informants during
the period immediately preceding the last inspection. For
the period immediately preceding this inspection, an average
ef $1,643.10 was paid to informants each month. A spot
check of payments made to CIs and PCIs indicated value was
being received for the money paid. You should insure that
your personnel are alert to the use of monetary payments to
enlist the further cooperation of infermants by compensating
them for expenses incurred in pursuit of information for
this Bureau and as compensation for their effort on the
Bureau's behalf. You should continue to closely evaluate
arene payments to insure that value is received for money
paid. :

-

“ ACCOMPLISHMENTS

: According to Bureau records your office shows
imcreases in 4 of the 8 statistical accomplishments
attributable to informants and it is noted that these
increases have occurred in matters concerned directly with FBI
investigations.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT esesasssics

eee You have indicated a rather extensive involvement
of supervisory personnel in directing informant development to
those areas of responsibility coming within the scope of
their respective desks. Referring. to Government reservations
and military installations, you indicated you do not

consider Government employees appropriate for development as
CIs as they are bound to furnish information as part of

their duties. Your attention is specifically directed to



: : aaa =

é

| ; \

| * Section 108, I-12, Volume 4, Manual of Instructions, which

} states informants should be developed on Government
reservations and military installations when warranted. In
view of the large installations located within your territory,
it is suggested you identify particular areas of these
installations wherein informant coverage would be logical
and productive and give consideration to pinpointing such areas
for development. 7 .

You have also indicated that Supervisors approve
payments to informants and in this way are also aware of the
productivity of the informant program. However, it is noted
that approval of payments provides a rather limited
assessment of the productivity of informants and points out
the need for a continuing evaluation of respective coverage.
Supervisors must constantly be alert to identify specific
areas in which informant as cues would be jogical and
“productive.

‘ OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

"You should give consideration to the development
.-of informants on Government reservations and military
installations as suggested by the Manual of Instructions.

In a number of instances, it was noted there was
nd follow-up on incomplete information furnished by informants.
In such instances, the informant was not recontacted any
sooner thar required by the 30 day contact rule, which would
indicate a lack of direction of the informant to further
develop information of interest. The need to give informants
@irection to develop information to the point it can be
considered useful and valuable should be brought to the
attention of all appropriate investigative Peteouten:

There were few instances noted during review of
the CI files wherein FD-302's had been utilized in recording
informant information. It is recognized that much information
regarding fugitives and possible suspects does not require

NW 55135 DocId:32989633

i.

such recording but in view of the recent passage of Senate
Bill 30 which will greatly expand the opportunity to ‘utilize
informant information, you should make certain all personnel
‘are aware of those instances in which informant information
should be recorded on an FD-302 and the proper method for ‘so
recording it. Hl

Numerous areas have been identified in your
territory as being the habitat of ethnic, ghetto and hippie
elements, many with a high incidence of crime. To provide
a better over-all view of the coverage in San Francisco and
. the heavily populated East Bay area and to facilitate a more
convenient, ready reference for the agents of your office to
this information, you should consider preparing a large wall
map of the San Francisco - East Bay area and placing it ina
central secure position in the office. In addition to criminal
informants, you should include the location in which racial
and ghetto informants will logically be able to furnish
information and you should identify the location of all these
informants on the map with an appropriate locator reference
to an index showing the agent to whom the inrormant is
assigned and the coverage which informant can be expected to
provide. . par

number of CI'S since the last inspection and have ling reased
the number of PCI'S since the last inspection. . We: have. also
increased our payments to informants and-no instances have
been found where we did not get value received from these
payments to informants. We have achieved excellent statistics
from them as indicated by the fact that at the close of the
last fiscal year we were ahead in all eight categories of
informant accomplishments. -This is our continuing goal and
we will make every effort to surpass these accomplishments

SA GARY aw GRAVITY: In Ithe period of time I have seen
10/28/70. assigned to criminal work I hive :
GNM: 31 handled a number of PCI$ with:a;view

to the qualification of them as.
approved Criminal Informants. In the past year since I
last had an approved Criminal Informant I have handled
several PCIs including one who previously was the prime
factor in the apprehension of a Bureau fugitive wanted
for the murder of a police officer. This PCI has since
furnished information of value which was relayed to the
local police in a burglary case. He has been given the
assignment to develop further information concerning local
suspects in the handling of stolen merchandise from this
and other burglaries.

In the past year I have been unable
to devote a great deal of time to the development of this
_ and other PCIs due to having been utilized as Relief
Supervisor in the absence of the regular supervisor and
because of the time necessary to prepare and presenti leciures
at police schools on legal matters.

I am aware of the importance of the
Criminal Informant Program and will continue efforts to
develop a qualified Criminal Informant and expect to
_ qualify the above~mentioned PCI in the very near future.

! Q :
SA CARLTON H. WOLPARTH: I am extremely aware of the need to

10/28/70 develop CIs and have had a total of ‘

CHW :ekk : nine PCIs in San Francisco during the
time I have been in a Francisco.

I arrived in the San Francisco Division,
7/13/69, on transfer from the Chicago Division. It is to be noted
that I developed CG 7215¢C in 1967. This informant had either
worked for or was close to the top men of organized crime in Chicago,
Miami and New Orleans. At one time, through a-court order, this
informant was wired with a microphone and tape recorder so
information could be obtained in an Obstruction of Justice case,
I had at least one other informant while I was handling the
above informant, and handled both until leaving Chicago.

The potential of the four PCIs which I
opened ‘on 8/24,/70 and the one which I opened 10/19/70 appears
promising and it is anticipated that at least one will develop
into a CI in the near future. Ssiestarst

My assignments 1 in San Praneisco have
been mainly ITSP = FBW investigations which are complicated and
involve reviewing records and interviews with banks, broksrage
house and other business officials, had one exegllent
opportunity to develop a good CI wheniLOUIS MARDER, Las Vegas
furnished me on 2/27/70 and 3/2/70 the original irfformation which
led to the recovery Q $650,000 worth of Aveo Thrift Certificates
at Las Vegas, [MARDERJas recently as 10/27/70, furnished me
valuable intorhition! He cannot be developed into a CI because
he lives in Las Vegas and is under Federal indictment in Miami.

PART A. GENERAL

1. The commercial or lucrative type of criminal
activity in the San Francisco Division continues to be
predominantly confined to the areas as noted below.
Exhaustive and probative investigation and close liaison
with local state and Federal agencies to date has reveaied no
evidence of an organized criminal group controlling these
activities in, §an Francisco or Resident Agency territories.
Investigation contacts with informants and other sources of
information have failed to reveal the existence of any
organs illegal gambling, loan..sharking {Shvlocking),

- Labor racketeering or planned bankruptcy frauds.

A. Local bookmaking involving horse and
sport bets conducted by numerous local
independent bookmakers, some of whom
have established "lay-off" arrangements

PRetaisuiet among themselves. : :

B. Prostitution activity primarily in the

eae “Tenderloin” section of San Francisco

involving out-of-town businessmen,
tourists, and servicemen with prostitutes,
most of whom are working for unorganized
negro "pimps".

C. Narcotic activity and related crimes
usually involving thefts and frauds near
universities, military installations, and
"hippie" or Bohemian sections of cities
within the division. :

are known to exist between ail Resident Agencies and the

local law enforcement agencies in their territories. No

evidence or information has been made available to this

office to indicate that there is any corruption in law

enforcement in this division.

As the Bureau is well aware, Mayor JOSEPH LAWRENCE

ALIOTO was the Subject of anti-racketeering investigation

by this office several years ago, however, this matter has

.been closed, ALIOTO prior to assuming the position of Mayor

of the City of San Francisco was a prominent and well known
j attorney, particularly in the field of anti-trust matters.
He.is known to have been the attorney for TONY LIMA, a former
| "Boss" of the LCN in San Francisco. He also represented a
number of other LCN figures and their associates.

: Prior investigation reveated that the cousin of
ALIOTO's father, JOHN ALIOTO, was the former "Boss" of the
Milwaukee LCN Family. JOHN ALIOTO attended the inauguration
of Mayor ALIOTO at San Francisco in January 1968.

| As a result of an article published in "Look"

» Magazine, September 23, 1969, linking ALIOTO with many LCN
figures, ALIOTO filed a $12.5 million libsl suit against
"Look" magazine and the authors of this article, RICHARD
“CARLSON and LANCE BRISSON.

“On May 15, 1970, Federal Judge BRUCE THOMPSON
‘declared a mistrial in San Francisco on this suit in that
the jury was unable to agree on the key issue of whether
the article linking ALIOTO with the “Mafia" was published
with "malice and reckless disregard for the facts." The
jurors told newsmen that the article was defamatory to
_ALIOTO and that at least 50 per cent of the 27 points were
indeed untrue. There was no agreement as to whether the
falsehoods and the article's general claim that ALIOTO was
“enmeshed in a web of alliances" with the "Mafia" represented
“malice and reckless disregard for the facts." U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled that such a finding is essential to a libel
Judgment sought by a public official.

4. Since last inspection extensive investigation as
well as informant coverage led to the first ITAR conviction
prosecutions ever in the San Francisco Division (see Item 7
below). : ’
Investigation in the case CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTIN,
ITHI, case developed a “shakedown” by ECKSTIN against local
bookmaker VICTOR ROMCLO. This matter arose out of the failure
of ROMOLO to pay a bookmaking debt owed ECKSTIN. SALVATORE
VINCENT "BILL" BONANNO, JOSEPH BONANNO, JR., MAURICE PATRICK
HARTIGAN and MARTIN CHEIPETZ CARSON acting as agents for
ECKSTIN attempted to collect the $1,600 gambling debt and
during contacts with ROMOLO threatened him with physical harm

if he failed to pay the debt. This case is currently
under investigation with the matter being presented to
the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco for violation
of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, Extortionate Credit
Transaction Statute. Hee

It should be pointed out that "BILL" BONARNO
and JOSEPH BONANNO, JR. are the sons of JOSEPH BONANNO, SR.,
a “Commission” member of the LCN in the United States.

presently under investigation and will be presented to the

Since last inspection investigation has continued
in regard to GUISEPPI CONFORTE, the reported Vice Lord,
State of Nevada, who for years has headed up a major pros-
titution operation. Through extensive investigation and
the placement of SF 3239+C~TE and SF 3369~C, this organization
has been completely penetrated identifying his lieutenants

“and scope of operation. As a result of the above, ic has Leen

determined that CONFORTE's operation has spread to the state
o£ Hawaii being controlled there by one of his top lieutenants,

“@OMMY SEALE. San Francisco has under. preparation an affidavit

for a request of a Title 3 electxrcnic surveillance on the
phones utilized by this organization in Honolulu. This Title 3
affidavit has been prepared with the assistance of Departmental
Attorney at San Francisco and who has discussed same with the
Organized Crime Section, Department of Justice, who has advised
that upon completion of current investigation in Honolulu the
affidavit should be immediately submitted for approval.

penetration of the racketeering operation _since the last
inspection information was received that{ a a]

‘and reportedly JIMMY HOFFA's special West Coast representative.
JOHNSON and FIDLER travelled to San Francisco from Boston in
January, 1970 and through surveiliance and subsequent intensive
investigation it was detérmined that they met with one GEORGE
R. DUNCAN, international Representative, International
Typographers Union (ITU). It was determined that shortly
prior to the travel of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the San Francisco
area a strike situation existed at the San Rafael “Independent
Journal" newspaper involving the ITU. Through cooperation and
liaison with local law enforcement, JOHNSON and FIDLER were
arrested near San Rafael, California and found to be in
possession of handguns and mace. Shortly after the return
of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the Boston area, an individual who
had knowledge that they had been given this contract was

-- ound murdered in Post: on his bndv were found the names
and telephone numbers of SONNSON and RR. Through these
efforts the attempt by JOHNSON and FIDLER to perform the
conditions of the contract were thwarted. In addition, this
matter is being considered by Departmental Attorney for
possible Federal Grand Jury presentation.

7 Another example of progress made in the penetration

a in the field of intelligence and organized crime in this area

resulted when through information furnished by top echelon
informants revealing the presence of ALATADENO JAMES FRATIANNO
‘vesiding in the San Francisco territory. Lfhrough investigation
and surveillances conducted FRATIANNO was subsequently contacted
-and was developed as a top echelon target cf this division.
Frequent contacts were conducted with FRATIANNO and extensiye
-Neooperation was obtained from him concerning organized crime
FRATIANNO was identified as a member of the Los Angeles Family
o£ the LCN and during August, 1970 was indicted by Federal
Grand Jury convening in San Francisco for two counts of
violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, ECT. Although
presently incarcerated FRATIANNO is being contacted periodically
as a target_in an effort to continue development of his
cooperation. . : :

A Subsequent to the submission of last inspection

report, through information by top echelon, informants this
office, information has been developed that SP 2689-C-TE
has assumed the position of “Boss" of the San Francisco
LCN Family. :

SF 2656-PC has reported to the return to the San
Jose area of STEFANO ZOCCOLI, Consiglieri of the San Jose LCN
Family from Los Angeles where he had been residing for the
past year.

During November 1969, SF 2656~PC reported that
GEORGE ADRAGNA, a member of Western Pennsylvania Family of
‘the LCN was coming to the San Jose area to live. Subsequently,
SF 2656-PC and SF 268¥-C-T reported tiat ADRAGNA’s seibeiship
had been transferred to the San Jose LCN Family and he is
currently residing in the San dose area.

“Subsequent to the submission of last inspection
report SF 2689~C-TE reported that JAMES FRATIANNO, a member
of the Los Angeles LCN Family had moved into the San Francisco
‘area where he remained until August when he commenced serving

“a prison sentence executed by the State of California.

“During October, 1969, information was received
indicating that JERRY LISNER, major bookmaker, Los Angeles,
California was in contact with .JOHN CASTELLI, bookmaker,
Oakland, California. The purpose of this contact was for
LISNER to establish a base of operation, particularly book-
making, for his criminal activities in the San-Francisco
area, Investigation subsequently established that LISNER
and others commenced a bookmaking operation in Alameda and
Contra Costa Counties, East Bay Area, using as its front
A-1l TV Service, Oakland, which is owned by JOHN CASTELLI.
Following extensive investigation in cooperation with the
Oakland Police Department, no evidence was developed to
indicate any violation of Federal statutes. On November 22,
1969, the Oakland and Berkeley, California Police Departments
simultaneously arrested SALVATORE J. BERNICE, JOHN TRAPPS and
two other associates who were engaged in LISNER's bookmaking

entire bookmaking operation and subsequently during
February, 1970 LISNER returned to the Los erated
California area.

Suaeeeeec In July, 1970, information was made available

of WALTER DALY, PAULA DALY and SABRINA DUNN, These indi-

A viduals were arrested for prostitution, conspiracy,

In addition to the foregoing, as a result of
information furnished by SF 2956-C-TE and SF 3036-PC,,
CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., Major San Francisco Pookmaker,
was arrested on August 4, 1970, by the San Francisco Police
Department on charges of bookmaking and ex-convict in

PART B: GAMBLING MATTERS

1. In. the San Francisco Division there appears
to be two gambling operators that lead all others in terms

ECKSTEIN and CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., both of whom are
based in San Francisco. While they both handle substantial
individual accounts, ECKSTEIN and LEAHY are primarily
associated with and rely on lessor local bookmakers for
"action." pebastcosti

CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTEIN, age 40 years, has been
engaged in gambling activities most of his adult life.
ECKSTEIN was formerly associated with TONY RUIZ and otner

has set up his own independent operation. ECKSTEIN has been
arrested on several occasions on charges of bookmaking but
has never been convicted of this violation. In 1965 ECKSTEIN
was convicted for failure to pay Federal wagering tax which
conviction was subsequently overturned. Details regarding
his current operation are set forth below in Paragraph 3.

CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., a native San Franciscan,
in his middle 40's, has been engaged in bookmaking activities
throughout his adult life. He was convicted in United
States District Court, San Francisco, in 1961 for arrest
on 9/28/60 for violation of Title 26, Section 7203, U.S.

sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation.
Subsequent to his incarceration, LEAHY moved to Medford,
Oregon. He returned to the San Francisco area in the Spring
of 1969 and resumed his bookmaking activities. During his
absence from San Francisco, his ex-brother-in-law, KENNETH
JOSEPH ZAHND, reportedly handled his, LEAHY's, bookmaking
operation. LEAHY was recently arrested by the San Francisco
Police Department on local bookmaking charges and is
currently awaiting trial.



_ -h-

2. fhe types of gambling prevalent in the San
Francisco Division are primarily wagering on horse races
and sporting events. In addition, small numbers betting
“with a weekly drawing take place usually in the Spanish-
speaking communities. There are also legal and illegal
card games operating usually in low-income commercial
“neighborhoods. Gambling in the division is conducted by
individual operators who are independent of each other,
except for layoff purposes with respect to bookmaking and
there are no indications of Leeda control over any of
these ‘activities.

3. Concerning the extent of gambling in this
Givision, bookmakers ECKSTEIN and LEAHY, named in Paraqraph
1 above, operate in the following manner. Both ae in
daily contact with their accounts located in the Bay area
which include other bookmakers for layoff purposes, split
_ bookmakers, and numerous individual bettors.

Bets are placed with these operations generally
. at locations to which the general public has access, such
ee as bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other small shops.
The "action" received at these business locations are in
turn called in to a phone spot operated by a bookmaker who
*’ has a gambling relationship with the operator | of the
"business.

‘| ECKSTEIN normally cperates with six employees,
including two phone men, a bookkeeper, a pay & collect man,
‘and two runners. In addition, he utilizes several split
bookmakers as employees. The principal bookmakers and
split bookmakers-involved in the ECKSTEIN bookmaking
operations are THEODORE CHALMIS, ALBERT DiGERONIMO, ELBERT
HEDRICK, MANNY PRONGOS, and ALBERT CARLSON. ECKSTEIN's
monthly handle based on informant data, evidence seized by
the San Francisco Police Department during recent bookmaking
raids, and interviews of bettors is estimated to be approxi-
mately $50,000 for horse bets. His sports "action" varies
_with the season of the year and bettor interests in particu-
lar sporting events; however, ECKSTEIN's handle for sports
action is estimated to be $40,000 per month.

LEAHY's operation normally consists of a separate
phone man for horse racing action and sports bets, at least
two pay & collect men, and several runners operating in the
vicinity of three San Francisco bars in which LEAHY
reportedly has a hidden interest. The persons believed
to be associated with LEAHY as bookmakers and/or split
bookmakers are ROBERT MAGIDSON, ATTILIO SPAGNUOLA, VICTOR
FORNER, KENNETH ZAHND, MORRIS COOPER, and, ALBERT CARLSON,

: With respect to LEAHY's handle it is to be noted
that a review of records seized at the time of his arrest
on 8/4/70 discloses a daily handle for horse action in the
approximate amount of $2,000 or approximately $50,000 per
month. Data regarding LEAHY's sports handle is incomplete
but Zt is estimated that this handle is comparable to that

of ECKSTEIN. ae i i.

Based on a review of available gambling records
seized by local authorities on lessor local bookmakers,
it is estimated that they have a monthly handle of approxi-
mately $25,000 each. Investigation, including contacts
with informants and local authorities, indicates there are

“approximately 20-30 lessor bookmakers operating in the

San Francisco Division on any given day. Accordingly, it
would appear that the monthly handle for the San Francisco
Division is in the approximate amount of one million dollars.

4. Sports line is formed by local bookmakers who
receive an early opinion line from sports services located
in Los Angeles, California, operated either by GERALD

. KILLGORE, DOMINICK "SONNY" DeFALCO, or FRANK MILANO.

Upon receipt of this line information, the local’ bookmaker
will make his own adjustments, if necessary, to suit his
particular situation. In addition, the local major news-

. papers in this division publish line information on a daily

basis prior to a particular sporting event.

Early race results are currently being furnished
to local bookmakers by JERI GORDON MATZA who openly operates

a sports service at 225 Kearny Street, San Francisco.
Investigation has determined that MATZA receives race
results by calling either California Turf, Los Angeles,
a horse race results business operated by FRANK MILANO,
or J & K Sports Journal, North Hollyuood, California,
operated by GERALD KILLGORE.

As a result of extensive investigation in the

ECKSTEIN ITWI case, a "Shakedown" on the part of ECKSTEIN

against a local bookmaker was developed. This investigation
»has resulted in two major ECT cases involving non-payment
| : of bookmaking debts which are currently under investigation
and before the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco. To
date, eight local bookmakers have appeared before the
Federal Grand Jury and others will be called. This has had
a disruptive effect among bookmakers and has created an
atmosphere of distrust.

6. Pursuant to instructions set forth in Bureau
letter to SAC Albany 1/27/70 regarding gambling investiga-
tions under proposed SB30, a review of gambling cases was
undertaken, It shvmid be pointed ovt that during the past
three years, it has been the policy of the San Francisco
Office to closely follow the activities of local gambling
organizations and/or subjects in an attempt to develop any
| indication of a Federal gambling violation. Per instructions
| additional 162 and 165 cases have been opened and investigated.

: Specifically since 2/1/70 sixty-three 162 cases and ninety-
ee eight 165 cases have been opened.

j 1. © The La Cosa Nostra (LCN) continues to exist in the Northern
California area and includes a San Francisco "family"

. and a San Jose “family." There are currently 8 members of the
San Francisco “family” residing in this division and 19 members
of the San Jose "family" residing in this division. In addition,
there are two members of the San Francisco "family" residing in
the Sacramento Division, one member in the Los Angeles Division,
one in the Chicago Division and two members pesently residing
in Italy. There are currently 3 members of the San Jose "family"

-yesiding in the Sacramento Division and one in the Las Vegas
Division. All of these members have been identified asmembers
of the San Francisco or San Jose "families by TE informants
of the San Francisco Division.

Four top echelon informants of this division who are
members of LCN "families" have failed to indicate that the LCN
“tamilies" of this division register any control over gambling,
narcotics, prostitution or any other organized illegal activity
within this division. :

N The present leadership of the San Francisco "family"
has recently been assumed by ANTHONY LIMA, who took over this
position when the previous "boss", JAMES JOSEPH LANZA, stepped
_ down in his favor. The “underbogs" of the San Francisco "family"
vis GASPARE "BILL" SCIORTINO and this "family" has one Capo de
Decina, VINCENZO INFUSINO, who resides in pacer California,
in the Sacramento Division. :

The leadership of the ‘San Jose "amily" remains the same
as at the time of the last inspection report with JOSEPH CERRITO,
the "boss," PHILIPPO OCTAVIO MORICI and STEFANO ZOCCCLI,
Consiglieris, and one Capo de Decina, EMANUEL FIGLIA. No-ap-
pointment has been made to the position of "underboss" since
the death of the preyious "underboss," CHARLES CARBONE, in 1967.

INSPECTOR ARNOLD’C. LARSON: The following comments
10/27/70 a : are based on a review of
JQ@FD: ap information 9f pending

: files and interviews
with appropriate personnel: anes

LA COSA NOSTRA (ICN)

Investigation by your office revealed the existence
of two LCN "families" within your territory. Membership
within these "families" total 64 individuals. Your
investigation revealed neither “family" is considered to be
very strong and has little or no illegal operations being
conducted on a day to day basis.

One "family" is centered in | the

. and has for the past few
- an attendee at the Apalachin meeting in 1957. Lanza has

recently stepped down as boss of the San Francisco "family"

and has been replaced by Toni Lima. Your investigation

“reveals that Lima's leadership has not been approved by

the "commission." You should follow this matter closely

so you will be in a position to know all activities relating

“to this change in position.

Lanza,

The second “family" is centered : in the San Jose area
sand is headed by boss Joe Cerrito. This "family" exhibits
--" little enthusiasm for illegal operations. You should closely
follow the activities of members of this "family" to insure
that any illegal operations are immediately known to your
office.

_ Organized Crime tos ?

+
: Although prostitution, gambling and narcotic activities
exist within your division, there is no indication from your
investigations that these operations are controlled by either

the LCN or other organized groups. Your investigations
should be continually pursued with vigor in order that your
office will be aware of any illegal operations within your
division. This is particularly true in regard to gambling
activities in view of the recent passage of Senate Bill 30.

_wr_55125 poctd:32999639 Page 136 Qo.

As you are aware provisions of Senate Bill 30 made it al
Federal crime in certain gambling operations and it will
not be necessary to prove interstate aspects of the
gambling activity. i

Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program (TECIP)

It is noted your office has penetrated the LCN
"families" in both San Jose and San Francisco through the
development of member informants. This is very noteworthy
and you are encouraged to make certain that your member
informants are utilized to the best advantage of the Bureau.

, Also, it is noteworthy that you have increased your TE
‘ coverage from 7 to 10 since the last inspection.

SF 3058-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-4670; Bureau
‘Eile 137-17455) was rated fair because of a lack of productivity.
You should follow instructions issued in Bureau letter dated
July 14, 1970 and if this informant is unproductive for four
months subsequent to the receipt of that letter the informant
should be closed.

F Although SF 2745-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-3456;
“Bureau file 137-11174) was rated good, his progress should
be closely followed. Although he is noted to be a member
informant the file indicates he is very sick with varicose
veins and is very old. The majority of information furnished
by this source has been of a nature of past activities and
little present information is being furnished by him. You
should endeavor to have him furnish more productive recent
informant or give consideration to concentrate on a more
productive source.

A review of your file 137-5207, Bureau file 137-20313
concerning SF 3208-~C-TE indicates the source was last contacted
on June 26, 1970. The file indicates this jsource sold his
business and left for Los Angeles and this information was
learned by your office on August 13, 1970. The file also
indicates this TE left the New York area because of being
a victim of a shylock loan. In view of this information
you should closely follow this informant's activities and
be circumspect:in dealing with the informant to prevent
any possible embarrassing situation from arising.

The following is a rating of the PCs and a comparison
with the ratings at the time of the last inspection:

It is very encouraging to note that you have increased
your targets from 39 from the time of the last inspection to

* gontinue this most desirable trend. :

eect SF 2123-PC (San Francisco file 137-4945; Bureau file

_ 137-11841) was rated fair. This target was opened on April
8, 1968 and was last contacted on October 10, 1969. You
advised that contact is being held in abeyance pending a
surveillance which was conducted by the Oakland Police
Department in early 1970. In view of the length of time
since this case was opened and the length of time since this
target was contacted he was rated fair.

SF 2630-PC (San Francisco file 137-2967; Bureau file
137-9023) was rated fair. By letter dated December 10, 1968
.the Bureau advised that this target was over two years old
‘and that you should consider deleting within four months if
he was unproductive. This informant was also rated fair
during the last inspection because of lack of productivity.

The only reason this informant is being classified fair,
instead of poor is because information contained in your
letter to the Bureau dated September 18, 1970 wherein your
informant reported information was furnished by a TB to

‘ the effect that the present "boss" of the San Francisco
LCN "family" had been discussing leadership of the San
Francisco LCN with the target. You are instructed that
in the event he does not furnish valuable positive information
within 90 days he should be closed and a more suitable target
developed.

SF 3061-PC (San Francisco file 137-4768; Bureau file
137-17558) was also rated fair. This target along with the
other two targets rated fair should be closely followed for
90 days and be given specific assignments during that period
of time. In the event they are unproductive they should be
closed. :

: SF 2582-PC (San Francisco file 137-2658; bureau file

SF 3135-PC (San Francisco file 137-5010;/ Br
137-19079) was opened on ‘May 17, 1968. During the, swo
inspections since he was opened this PC was rated Unsufficient
Data to Rate. On November 20, 1969 you. advised that an
interview of this PC was being held in abeyance pending an
investigation by the Oakland, California Police Department.
The file indicates that that investigation was completed on
August 6, 1970 with your target paying a $125 fine. On
August 19, 1970 you advised that interview of the target
was being delayed pending further investigation. You are
instructed that this interview should be immediately conducted
in order to determine if this target will be cooperative with
your office.

“SF 3297-PC (San Francisco file 137-5457; “Bureau file
1137-22106) was opened on October 17, 1969. The file indicates
that this target has never been interviewed and you indicate
that contact with the target is being delayed until a more
logical area of vulnerability is developed. Inasmuch as
this - -target is CVEX CNY year uid Gi as Leli that sulficient

“information should be developed so that your office might
approach this target to determine if he will be cooperative
with your office.

‘ SF 3192-PC (San Francisco file 137-5016; Bureau file

137-10982) was opened on May 21, 1968. SF 3110-PC (San

. Francisco file 137-2182; Bureau file 137~22452) has been

“ opened since December 8, 1969. It would appear that
sufficient time has elapsed inorder for your office to
develop background information so that an interview of

. these targets can be conducted. You should without further
delay interview these targets to determine if they will be
cooperative and if not you should consider closing and finding
more suitable targets for development.

i Information you furnished indicates there are ten
SAs who are working either exclusively or virtually exclusively
.on the CIP and IGA program who have not developed TEs.
Although all ten Agents have PCs their progress should be
closely followed to insure their participation in the
development of TEs. In this regard you may desire to
reiterate provisions of the Manual of Instructions to the
Agents on the program concerning the Cass TNNAEaSIn of TE
informants.

; All Agents are to be reminded that in dealing with

} informants, they are to be particularly alert and not |
leave themselves open for criticism or false accusations.
The importance of having an alternate contacting Agent '
or another Agent along during the course of certain,
interviews is advisable in case any compromising situation
is attempted. '

i ;
‘With the recent enactment of Senate Bill 30 you
should concentrate on increasing your informant coverage in
the areas covered by this legislation. Also in regard to
the passage of Senate Bill 30 dealing with gambling, which
you are aware does not now require interstate activity, you
should not overlook the utilization of your racial informants
to furnish information to your office concerning gambling
activities. Other divisions of the Bureau have been
particularly successful in coordinating the information
from racial informants in to the CIP and IGA programs.

Statistical Accomp

During the fiscal year (fy) you recorded two convictions
_in the CIP-IGA category. During the fy 1970 your office had
three convictions. During the first three months of fy 1971
you have recorded one conviction in this category.

a According to the information furnished by your office

, you have four cases pending prosecution, two of which are
in the 159 (LMRDA-IM) category end two are in the 92

+ (Anti-Racketeering) category. Only one of these cases is

. in the CIP-IGA program. A review of your files indicates
that in file 179-24 in a case captioned JAMES FRATIANNO,
EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTION (ECT), the subject was
indicted :under Title 18, Section 894 of the U.S. Code.

. Your office was working the case under Anti-Racketeering

. classification and the file was opened after the ECT

’ indictment. : Ei

In regard to the possible statistical accomplishments,

. from the above file it would appear the local office of the
United States Attorney will seek indictments under the ECT

, Statute. A review of your cases in this category reveal only

_ three Office of Origin cases. The files also indicate instances

‘wherein there are shylocking activities among the gamblers

where there are large debts outstanding. A review of your



i 7 "30

‘file 165-100 on Kenneth Joseph Zahnda, aka! Morris Cooper,

ITWI, indicates the local office of the United States Attorney
appears to be in no rush to seek Grand Jury indictments on
gambling matters. If the local office of the United States
Attorney will entertain prosecution under ECT and is in

' no rush to seek indictments under the gambling statute,

‘Supervision And Manpower

DRUMS 2

you should review at squad conferences with Agents assigned
to the program provisions of SAC letter 68-46 dated August
20, 1968 wherein provisions of the ECT statute are set forth.

In relation to statistical accomplishments, prior
experience has shown a direct relationship between Office
of Origin cases in a particular classification and statistical
accomplishments. As of September 30, 1970 your monthly
administrative report reflects the following Office of Origin
cases in the categories enumerated:

A review of the monthly administrative reports since
“the last inspection indicates your office of origin cases
has remained fairly constant since the last inspection.
With the increase of manpower on this program and the
addition of informant development since the last inspection
it is anticipated that your office should be in position at
this point to begin to show results in regard to the
statistical accomplishment phase of this program.

fs :

The CIP and IGA program is supervised by Supervisor
Charles N. Hiner, Discussions with Supervisor Hiner and
personnel assigned to the program indicate a very enthusiastic
approach to the problems involved in this program. -



ve 31

: 7 Immediately prior to the last inspection, by letter
May 29, 1970 captioned "CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,
ASSIGNMENT OF ADDITIONAL MANPOWER," you advised the Bureau
of the addition of ten Agents to be assigned exclusively:
:to this program. Your success since that time has been
noted by the addition of one conviction in 1970 vs. 1969.
Also you have added three TEs to the program and seven
additional PCs. This is to your credit and you are encouraged
to continue this favorable trend. However, the collection
of. intelligence information, though very important, is only
one phase of this program. The other phase of the program
-which must receive close supervision and personal attention
is the obtaining of convictions to fulfill the Bureau's
responsibility toward statistical accomplishments.

: In regard to statistical accomplishments, other
divisions of the Bureau have been very successful in
the utilization of Title 3. The utilization of Title 3
requires extensive use vf manpower aud if Lhe Title 3 you: -
are presently awaiting approval is appreved you should
judiciously use manpower in the perenne dal the Title 3
installation.

|

In regard to the utilization of manpower, it is
imperative that all Agents assigned to this program show
the necessary zeal to accomplish the desired results of |

intelligence information and statistical accomplishments.

- In the event any Agents assigned to the program fail to
show the necessary enthusiasm consideration should be given
to-the reassignment of those Agents to other squads.

A review of your 162 files indicates several instances
wherein Bureau instructions were not followed. These Bureau
instructions were set forth in Bureau airtel dated Apsil 2
1969, captioned "INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITY MATTERS." This
is found in your file 162-00-21. Briefly, these instructions
stated that the 162 classification should be reserved for
"intelligence-type" inquiries and that substantive cases
should be opened under the proper classification. These

violations, of course, should ae prose tee in Federal
court. .

SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS sues
Inspzcror anol’.
INSPECTOR ARNDU C. LARSON: The following comments, *'

observations, recommendations
and instructions are being made after an in-depth review of
a representative number of your Selective Service Act matter
cases and administrative files along with conversations with
supervisory and Agent personnel and review of the answers to
questions in a separate yellow (4-M-5):

: The San Francisco area is a
haven to draft dodgers and this undesirable situation will.
not be reversed until we make this area unattractive for
“bums,""“hippies," and members of white and black extremist
groups who come to San Francisco in order to avoid the draft.
Several obstacles must be surmounted in order to reverse this
undesirable situation. The indifferent attitude that the
judges have displayed to date must be reversed towards a

tough handling of Selective Service Act violators. Supervisory
and Agent pnersarnnel mnet maintain an aggreccive attitude and
continue to be a leader in streamlining processing procedures
by the United States Attorney's Office and various Selective
Service Boards to insure that these violators are promptly
prosecuted in the courts. Every technique available to the
Bureau should be used to get the judges, United States
Attorney and public riled up about this ridiculous situation.

Aggravated violators should be put in jail.

There are 2,983 "hippie-tyne"
communes in the San Francisco Division comprising in excess
of 20,000 population. 1,050 of these communes are located in

| : , 5. Investigations have developed strong
indications that there is a loosely
- organized _ movement by registrants,
to deliberately crowd the court calendars
in San Francisco to make the reaching
of any one man as slow as possible.
This will also give the violator the
opportunity of getting the indictment
against him dismissed alleging that
the defendent cannot receive a speedy
trial.

6. The former United States Attorney had
on his staff an assistant handling 25
cases who had never served in the Armed
Forces and was outwardly sympathetic
towards the Selective Service Act
violators. The new United States Attorney
has a good attitude towards the prosecu~
tion of these violators, however, he has
not completely replaced the staff of the
old United States Attorney.

A major portion of the Selective
Service Act violations in the San Francisco Division pertains
“to the inductees failing to step forward to be sworn into
. the Armed Forces, thereby refusing induction. The Armed
Forces Examining and Entrance Station located in Oakland,
“California handles all inductions for Northern California
sand part of Nevada and handles approximately five per cent
.of all inductions in the United States.

Approximately 38 per cent of
all refusals for induction into the Armed Forces arise at
Oakland, according to the Department of the Army statistics.
Many registrants ffom all over the United States come to the
‘gan Francisco area for the specific purpose of having their
‘local draft board changed to this area, and after meeting
all other requirements for induction, refuse to step forward
to be inducted knowing that they will have two years or longer
‘of freedom due to the slow handling of these cases by the
Selective Service Board, United States Attorney's Office
‘and the courts. San Francisco has several cases where the
violations are over two years old in which no prosecutive
action has been taken.

NW 55135 DocId:32989633 Page 149


It is evident from the
backlog of cases awaiting trial (414), backlog of cases’
awaiting prosecutive action by the Federal Grand Jury
po {749) and the fact that these violations are being re-
ceived by your office at the average rate of 175 cases
per month, that something must be done to get these
cases before the courts. The most aggravated cases should
be singled out and tried first, particularly those indi-
viduals who are members of extremist groups. Experience

3 has shown that after several subjects have received rigid

E sentences, and a widély publicized trial, that many subjects
enter guilty pleas hoping for lesser sentences by avoiding
the Government the expense of a trial. "

It is recognized the San

Francisco Division has been most forcefully making every
effort to expedite the handling of these cases, particularly
through the judiciary. Indications are that the relatively
newly appointed United States Attorney is sympathetic and
receptive to the problem and is making an effort to diminish
-the backlog of cases awaiting Grand Jury presentations, but
it is recognized once an indictment is returned, it is then
up to the judiciary to proceed through the final step, to
which they have not been particularly receptive. They have
not responded enthusiastically to handling these matters in
Federal Court.

It is obvious the Federal
Judges in Northern California (San Francisco Division) have
. ‘resisted any and all pressures brought to bear upon them
concerning this problem. In my analysis of this situation,
I have determined that the United States Attorney's Office,
personnel of the FBI, and Selective Service personnel have
all attempted to influence the Judges in handling these
matters more expeditiously to no avail. Furthermore, within
recent months there has been wide-spread nation-wide publicity
relative to their coddling and minimizing this particular
problem. This apparently has had no effect upon them. It
would, therefore, appear that the various Federal Judges
will not react to this problem unless some superior influential
individual or group can forcefully bring this matter to their
attention, particularly if such individual or group is one
‘which the Federal Judges would respect. The obvious answer
is the Administrator of the Courts for the Federal Judicial
System in Washington, D.C. and/or Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, WARREN BURGER.

You are, therefore, instructed 2
to suggest to the Bureau that the contents of the letterhead
memorandum setting forth this overall problem be brought to
the attention of the Attorney General with the further sug~
gestion that the Attorney General bring this matter to the
attention of the Administrator of the Courts of the Federal

ee Judicial System and/or Chief Justice BURGER for his analysis
and information, and the further suggestion he may desire to
communicate with the Chief Federal Judge in San Francisco
relative to these matters. 7 ’

" gac, ASAC, Supervisory and
Agent personnel should take advantage of every opportunity
to personally discuss this aggravated situation with the
United States Attorney, Selective Service Board officials,
SAC contacts and other prominent individuals to get them
xyiled up about this ridiculous situation. Insure that

.continucus cluse liaison is maintained by supervisory and
Agent personnel with United States Attorney's Office and
various local draft board officials to insure that these
cases are Promptly processed and prosecuted.

Your office in April, 1969
suggested to the former United States Attorney that arresting
several inductees on the spot might have a favorable effect

.” wpon lowering the rate of refusals at the Oakland Induction

-- Center. The only objection given by the former United States
Attorney was that the case of the registrant must be presented
‘to the Federal Grand Jury within two weeks after arrest. Due
‘to your effective liaison, most of the "bottlenecks" have been
worked out between the Selective Service Board and United
States Attorney's Office in which these arrests can now be
effected. You should be alert to members of extremist groups
who will fail to step forward at the time of their induction
and appropriately arrange with the United States Attorney for
authority to arrest these individuals on the spot. You should
insure that such arrests are given adequate press coverage.
Such plans should be brought to the attention of the Bureau
for their consideration in making a national press release,
iff warranted.

You must closely coordinate
Selective Service Act cases with Agents handling extremist
groups such as the Black Panther Party, Weatherman, SDS; etc.
These files should be cross-referenced by appropriate
memoranda.

Statistical Accomplishments and Administrative Handling Ee Cases

1
: 4 aeuen
! As of 9/30/70, you had 1,873 origin Selective ~
Service matters (1,799 active and 74 inactive). Between
March and September 1970 you received 1,186 Selective Service
Act matters for investigation, an average of 169 (1,186 - 7)
per month. As of 10/23/70; 1,163 of the origin cases were
completed. 749 cases are awaiting the United States
Attorney's (USA) prosecutive decision, and 414 cases involve
indictments of subjects and are awaiting trial. The case
load is split about in half between Headquarters City and
Resident Agents. 17 Agents are assigned to Squad 6 who
handle only Selective Service Act (SSA) matters and their
informants. One Agent has been on extended sick leave.
Approximately 18 Resident Agents spend between 60 to 100%
of their time on Selective Service Act matters. During
the fiscal year 1970, ending 6/30/70, you recorded 74
convictions and for the first four months of fiscal year 1971,
7 ending Sheatetas you have recorded $ convictions.

The procedures followed by your office concerning
the immediate handling of subjects who refuse to step forward
at the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station, Oakland,
California, appear to save Agent time and Government expense
and should be continued. It is noted, however, that several
months elapse between the time the Subject is interviewed and
. the time the United States Attorney makes his prosecutive
- decision since he insists that the Selective Service file be
processed and forwarded to his office by the State Director of
the Selective Service Board. You should have Headquarters
city Agents continue close liaison with Selective Service
Boards and the United States Attorney's Office to insure that
these cases receive expeditious processing and are presented to
the Federal Grand Jury at an early date. i
current administrative procedures being followed in
these refusal type cases are as follows: r

The Induction Officer at the Armed Forces Examining
and Entrance Station, Oakland, California, calls an Oakland
Agent when there is going to be one or more inductees who will
refuse to submit to induction. Inductions are handled on
a Wednesday of each week. The Special Agent witnesses the
refusal, conducts a short interview of the Subject, and in
almost every instance’secures an admission from the Subject
that he khew he was violating the law and that he had thought

aYe.



about this matter carefully before refusing to ‘step feeeee
forward. The Agent during this interview obtains thé’ Subject's
current address which is generally different from the one he
furnished the Selective Service Board. The Agent places

the Subject on notice as to what probably will occur as. to an
indictment, summons, etc. The Subject is cautioned to remain
in touch with his Local Draft Board in order to avoid being

a Bureau fugitive.

A case is immediately opened and assigned to the
Oakland Agent who prepares a report. Information copies of

_ the report are furnished to the local USA, San Francisco: and

the field office and the USA covering the Subject's draft

board when located in another division. It is the USA's

opinion (San Francisco) that the refusal to step forward takes

precedence over any prior delinquencies and will be handled

by the USA, San Francisco. Instructions are given in leads

to Headquarters city Agents and/or auxiliary offices to

closely follow the Local Board to insure that all pertinent

information regarding the Subject is promptly furnished

to the USA, San Francisco. Ee
In order to streamline the administrative handling

of these matters as well as keeping the Bureau fully

informed of the activity you are taking in thése matters to

insure prompt prosecutive handling, the following instructions

- Should be followed:

All refusal cases and all other cases in which
the investigation is completed should be reassigned to three or
four Headquarters city Agents. These Agents will have
the responsibility of getting these cases to the Federal
Grand Jury and on the trial calendar. Those cases in which
the subject becomes a fugitive should be reassigned to another
case Agent. : ¢
a At the present time there are 1163 cases pending
prosecutive action. In order to eliminate status letters and
reports to the Bureau in these type cases, the following
Procedures should be followed. . aoe
Memos to the SAC should be placed in individual
files to keep them from becoming delinquent. When the
Subject is indicted the Bureau should be immediately advised
dn each individual case. Beginning 10/30/70 and continuing
On the 15th and 30th of each. sphgequent month, you are to
advise the Bureau, by letter, entitled "SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT

Administrative Handling of Theft n
From Interstate Shipment Cases in
the San Francisco Division

resol “ARNOLD C. LARSON: During the course of ‘the

inspection of the San Francisco
pee a review was made of 140 Theft From Interstate Shipment
cases. Instances were noted wherein Bureau Regulations
‘concerning the handling of these cases were not followed. Set
forth below are instances noted during this review:

- In the following cases, it was noted the amount
involved appeared to be a minor amount and there appeared to
be no aggravating circumstances concerning. these violations.
In some instances concerning the cases which originated at the
San Francisco Airsort, it was noted the file indicated there
was a possibility of an individual at the airport being involved
in the theft. However, it is felt it is not necessary to keep
open all the minor cases in order to determine which, if any, .
employees at the airport may be involved. These cases where
minor amounts are involved are as follows:

Gp sorenyzsor GLENN A. HARTER: 1) This offipe received a
letter from the U.S. Attorney

4110/28/70
dated 6/24/69 wherein the

| U.S. Attorney advised that they would not undertake prosecution
of minor theft cases. ‘the letter set the guide as those
cases of value of less ihan $100. This pffice has been

| following the interpretation of minor thefts as those having

a value of less than $149, It was the judgment of this

office that Sout all of the airport thefts involved amounts

| in excess of $100. It appears that an average loss at the
airport would average an estimated $250, it being noted that

| the airline companies currently are paying up to $500 per

| bag. Therefore, these cases were not judged to be minor
‘eases and had not been discussed with the U.S. Attorney as

| : ‘their value exceeded $190, In following this policy San

| Francisco believed that they were in compliance with Section 9+

| + of the Manual regardiny presentation of minor cases to the

| US. Attorney. In the future this office will immediately

4 present cases of the type cited by the Inspector to the

U.S. Attorney before any investigation is conducted and

will consider suitcase type thefts as minor cases.

i . :
i 2)Submission of FD 302s. Regard:

| atte the fact that I had not detected that FD 302s were not

| _ included in the 25 files listed by the Inspector, I would
*. like to explain that 13 of these files were opened after
September 22 and I had not reviewed any of these files
as yet on tickler and thereby would not have had an
opportunity to detect the fact that the FD 302 was not
listed. The vemaininy files have not all been available
for review at this tine but it is obvious that some of
these files did not have FD 302s prepared :~ + promptly.

.. 8)NCIC Entries. Three of the
four files listed where NCIC entries had not been made
had not as yet .been reviewed on ticklers since they had been
veceived in this office, One of the four files, 15-11994, re-
flects a suitease claim check number which is not suitabl

4%) File 15-11981 was recommended
to be opened by, the sase Agent as he felt that this
shipment involved personnel and circumstances which

would be legically worked in connection with other existing
TFIS cases and that it might be a lever for possible
informant development The Agent hoped to work this case
even ‘though it was jot a Federal violation and obtain an

could obtain a criminal informant.

| eer

I regret very much that it was
necessary for the Inspector to call to my attention the
matters referred to in this administrative write-up. I
will take the necessary action to insure that minor cases

are immediately presented to the U.S. Attorney, that FD 302s
are immediately prepared, that NCIC numbers be immediately

entered where pertinent so that it will not be necessary
for these matters to be called to my attention again.

: / SAC ROBERT E. oEbnaber: The USA advised this office by
letter dated! 7/16/69 that the
"PBI should no fe present minor theft cases to the USA's
office and that these cases should be deferred to local
courts. The office has followed the policy set down by the
UA and has utilized his guideline of $100 as a minor case.
In view of his policy, the office has not been receiving minor
theft cases, as the local business community has been made
aware of the policy of the USA and has n¢t been referring
minor cases to the office. H
Occasionally some minor case is received from
someone not aware of the policy of the USA's office in not
prosecuting cases having a value of less than $106. In the
future when a complaint is received regarding a minor theft,
the case will be immediately presented to the USA and after
his declination, the office will advise the complainant and
the USA's office in writing and where appropriate, refer the
complaint to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
over the violation. This procedure will be in line with the

reguirom

al of Inspection, Section 94.

ADDENDUM

noe

INSPECTOR ARNOLD .« LARSON: In regard to your answer to this

pointed out to you:

write-up, the following is

4

1. Your answer implies the inspector indicated that

“all suitcase-type thefts are minor thefts. This is completely

inaccurate as each case, whether it be a suitcase or otherwise,
bas to be judged on the merits of the individual case. In

the review of 140 cases there was not one single instance
wherein the United States Attorney had been consulted to
determine if the case was a minor amount and he would not

entertain prosecution even if the subject were identified.

2. Concerning the submissions of FD-302‘s to the
file, the following is a tabulation of cases over two months
old in which no FD-302 is in the file:

PILE NUMBER

RInIBIE 15-11918
15-11816

i 15-11814

7/2/70
8/26/70

8/21/70 : :

Although the remainder of the 25 files pointed out to
you: did not contain FD-302's and the files had not come
up on ticklers for your review, it is apparent with this
number of files without FD-302's the Agents are not receiving
adequate instructions in conferences concerning proper
preparing of FD-302's in TFIS cases.



3. Although it was pointed out to you wherein ;
NCIC entries on serial numbers had not come up for adminis-
trative review, it is apparent that several Agents on your
squad have not been properly instructed in the necessity
of immediately entering serial numbers into NCIC. It should
not be necessary for you to have to remind Agents on your
squad on a periodic file review of the necessity of entering
serial numbers into NCIC. They should not wait an extended
period of time to enter these numbers in NCIC, but the serial
numbers should be entered immediately after they are obtained.

4, File 15-11981 was of a purely local nature and
should have been worked out of the related Federal violation
case rather than open a separate TFIS case wherein no
Federal jurisdiction was indicated in the opening serial.

on 3/2/87, for Failure to report For inauction on y/L7/66
The whereabouts of the Subject have been unknown since 3/16/67,
and considerable investigation has been conducted to locate
him. Information was developed in March, 1970, that Subject
- was possibly in Canada and a friend of Subject's mother advised
in September, 1970, that the Subject is in Canada, but that his
mother does not have an address for him. The Subject is re-
ported to telephone his mother on occasions. Other neighbors
--and police have reported Subject to be in Canada at the present
time.

In view of the above, the following action should be
promptly initiated in an effort to ascertain the location of

HUGHES. It is supervised by SA H. ERNEST WOODBY. .

Extended investigation has been conducted since
inception of this case in the neighborhood of Subject's parents,
1132 South Sage Court, Sunnyvale, California. When case was
initiated, it was detczmined Subject's family had moved from
870 El Camino, Mountain View, California, the address shown on
Subject's DD 553 in 12/68 which was prior to Subject's
reported absence from the military in 4/69. Subject's
parents have appeared to be cooperative md although present
neighbors of Suvjeci's parents are not well acquainted with
the Subject, they are cooperative and a neighborhood source
has been established.

Subject entered military service in 9/66 at San Jose,
California, at which time he was approximately 20 years of
age. Since initiation of this investigation, additional past
residences have been developed for Subject's parents at 278.
Lassen Avenue, Mountain View, California in 9/63; 620 East
Mauded Avenue, Sunnyvale, California in 7/68 and 1390 Latham
Street, Mountain View, in 7/68. A neighbor has indicated
Subject may have a brother but could furnish no specific
information concerning his identity. Attempts to, establish
residence at the Latham Street address have been negative.
Mail returned to the U.S. Army addressed to the Latham Street
address indicated a possible residence of Apartment 101, 1617
Pine Street, San Francisco, California. Investigation has
also indicated past employment for the Subject at Channing
House, Palo Alto, California, for a period not stated.

In view of the fact Subject had already entered
military service before his parents moved to their current
address, it is suggested investigation be concentrated in

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM {

BOND DEFAULT MATTERS t et

| 1

Le €. LARSON: As of 10/1/70, the San Francisco
Office had 48 bond defauit

matters under investigation. This volume of cases presents

a fertile field for increased convictions under the Bond

Default classification.

An in depth survey conducted by the Inspection
Division disclosed that there has been a significant
increase in cases received by the FBI for investigation
subsequent: to the passage of the Bail Reform Act of 1966.
This Act liberalized bail and bond procedures in Federal
cases whereby subjects were to be considered for release
on their own personal recognizance or unsecured appearance
bond in contrast to previous procedures which required a
specific bond, creating an excellent opportunity for us
to achieve statistical accomplishments. The ratio of
convictions to the number of cases investigated in bond
default matters is one of the highest of any violation

handled by the Bureau.

One of our offices, namely San Diego, has been

“responsible for the most significant portion of the Bureau's

convictions in bond default matters as a result of effective
liaison with the U. S. Attorney, who felt that an indictment
obtained under bond default was more easily proven than

the substantive offense. When a subject is apprehended,

the sentence is, in part, influenced by the U. S. Attorney,
who informs the court the length of time the subject's
apprehension has been sought by the Bureau. A number of
these cases have arisen through charges of narcotics and
‘smuggling of merchandise and aliens across the border.

. Subjects were brought before a magistrate, and rather than

pleading guilty, subjects obtained a court appointed
attorney and entered a not guilty plea. They were released
then on either personal recognizance or a minimum bond until
their scheduled appearance, When the subject failed to
appear in court, a bench warrant was issued, San Diego opened
a case, and.usuadily: within 30 days an indictment was secured
under bond default.

Hi

rt!

} ; Although San Francisco is not a border office,.
it is a great port of entry, both by sea and air, and many
of the same type cases utilized by San Diego for obtaining
a bond default indictment should be available to San,
Francisco.

u As you are aware, convictions are becoming more
difficult to obtain because of the court's interpretation
of the law in many classifications. Bond default matters
present an excellent opportunity to increase your conviction
rate, therefore, it is suggested that through your liaison
with the U. S. Attorney, point out to him the possibilities
for an increase in convictions under the Bond Default oH
Statute.

The necessity to establish effective liaison with
the U. S. Attorney in bond default matters was set out in
SAC Letter 70-13 dated 3/17/70..

If an increase in cases and convictions is obtained
as a result of this Suggestion Memorandum, advise the
Bureau by routing slip, attention Inspection Division.

requested. :

: en Oe M. DE JEAN: Close liaison will eontinue to
. 10/26/70~ be maintained with the United States
: Attorney's office and all avenues
of potential eonvictions will be
vigorously pursued to increase the statistical accomplishments
in the San Francisco Division.

SAC GEBHARDT: This matter will be followed and the

sh enna smd an increase in cases and convictions is

SA RICHARD ,GUY MILLER: At the beginning of the interview at the
10/27/70 asfvt~ Humboldt County Jail, Eureka, California,
I exhibited my FBI credentials to the

subject and advised him of the nature of the inquiry. I

_ ‘apparently inadvertently failed to record this in the opening

" paragraph of the FD 302 and on review of this FD 302 I
inadvertently failed to note this had been omitted from the

does not reoccur.

SA RICHARD.E, LUEBBEN: I was Relief Supervisor on Desk #6 in the

to the exceptionally high volume of mail

handled by this desk I inadvertently failed to note the above

omission from FD 302 of SA MILLER dated 9/1/70 when the report

was signed out by me. Every effort will be made in the future

to avoid a repitition of this delinquency,

considered herself a member of a "family" of hippies
including the Subject and another Navy deserter, At the
time of interview she advised that the members of this
hippie "family" received mail at her address and the reason

- for maintaining the address is to receive food stamps for
