on 2/2/62 Departmental Attorney WILLIAM KEHOE, currently
conducting a FGJ in Pittsburgh to inquire into the activitie
of the MANNARINOs and their associates, advised SA THOMAS G.
FORSYTH, III as follows:

*

He has heard that DANIEL HANNA, aka Speedo, who was convicte:
for his participation in the case captioned “STUART SUTOR,
et al; TGP; ITSP; FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY," and is, currently
incarcerated in the Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa.,

becomes increasingly unsettled. Although HANNA was an
unfaithful spouse, he was always a doting father, and the
forced separation from his only son, a ten year old, griges
him greatly.

\ their imprisonments in the best possible spirits; HANNA

When HANNA was arrested during the IRS raid on the MANNARINO
horse room-gambling casino on 8/24/61, KEHOE noted that

jot HANNA would not talk with anyone connected with the Federal
Government until he was brought into the Federal Building,

time, HANNA was observed by KEHOE to leave his associates an

it was noted that. HANNA spoke earnestly, courteously and

at length with SA FORSYTH.

ant Pittsburgh, to await his turn at a USC hearing. At that

It is KEHOE's feeling that HANNA, if he were so inclined,
could make an excellent witness against the MANNARINOs and
KEHOE feels he should be interviewed with this purpose

in mind at the earliest possible date, KEHOE a

is very unhappy. While his convicted co-defendants are taking

PG 92-236

SA FORSYTH go to Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg,

to conduct the interview, rather than have it conducted

by a SA from the Philadelphia Division, because SA FORSYTH

is thoroughly conversant with all aspects of the MANNARINO
investigations and has established a speaking relationship with
HANNA which now might prove effectual in persuading HANNA

to cooperate.

It is noted that KEHOE indicated that he might have a "deal"
to offer HANNA should HANNA decide to cooperate with the
Government against the MANNARINOs. At this juncture, KEHOE
was advised that SA FORSYTH could not take any part in
discussions concerning any deals and didimt even want to hear
the nature of thé inducement KEHOE would offer HANNA.

KEHOE was advised that if Bureau permission was. received,

SA FORSYTH would welcome an opportunity to talk with HANNA
and would bend every effort to persuade HANNA to cooperate,
put SA FORSYTH could not relay any message concerning a
"deal." KEHOE was told that any such message

would have to ke gotten to HANNA by some other means and
KEHOE replied that he understood and would, at the
appropriate time, make his own arrangements.

Bureau permission is therefore requested for’ SA FORSYTH

to travel to Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa., and
to interview DANIEL HANNA.
