on 2/2/62 Departmental Attorney WILLIAM KEHOE, currently

conducting a FGJ in Pittsburgh to inquire into the activities

of the MANNARINOs and their associates, advised SA THOMAS G.

FORSYTH, III as follows:

He has heard that DANIEL HANNA, aka Speedo, who was convicted

for his participation in the case captioned "STUART SUTOR,

et al; TGP; ITSP; FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY, " and is currently

incarcerated.in

the Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Fa.,

is very unhappy.

While his convicted co-defendants are

their imprisonments in the best possible spirits; HANNA

becomes increasingly unsettled. Although HANNA was an

unfaithful spouse, he was always a doting father, and the

forced separation

from his only son, a ten year old, gries

him greatly.

When HANNA was arrested during the IRS raid on the MANNARINO

horse room-gambling casino on 8/24/61, KEHE noted that

cHANNA would not talk with anyone connected with the Federal

Government until he was brought into the Federal Building,

pittsburgh, to await his turn at a USC hearing.

At that

time, HANNA was observed by KEHOE to leave his associates and

approach SA

FORSYTH who was present merely as an observer, anal

it was noted that HANNA spoke earnestly, courteously and

at length with SA FORSYTH.

It is KEHOE's feeling that HANNA, 'If he were so inclined,

could make an excellent witness against the MANNARINOs and

in mind at the earliest possible date 2i

KEHOE feels he should be interviewed with this purpose

KEHOE requested that

SA FORSYTH go to Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg,

to conduct the interview, rather than

have it conducted

by a SA from the Philadelphia Division, because SA FORSYTH

is thoroughly conversant with all aspects of the MANNARINO

investigations and has established a speaking relationship with

HANNA which now might prove effectual in persuading HANNA

to cooperate.

It is noted that KEHOE indicated that he might have a "deal"

to offer HANNA should HANNA decide to cooperate with the

To vera sea at A 2o could not take any are, E

discussions concerning any deals and didimot even want to hear

the nature of the inducement KEHOE would offer HANNA.

KEHOE was advised that if Bureau permission was received,

SA FORSYTH would welcome an opportunity to talk with HANNA

and would bend every effort to persuade HANNA to cooperate,

but SA

FORSyTH could not relay any message concerning a

'deal." KEHOE was told that any such message

would have to de gotten to HANNA by some other means and

KEHOE replied that he understood and would, at the

appropriate time, make his own arrangements.

Bureau permission is therefore requested for SA FORSYTH

to travel to Federal Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa., and

to interview DANIEL HANNA.
