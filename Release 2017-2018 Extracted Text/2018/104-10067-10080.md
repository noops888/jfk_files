SUBJECT: Garrison and the Kennedy Assassination:
Interview of Garrison on Dutch TV by
William L. Oltmans (201-155221)

REFERENCES: “A. Joint State-USIA cable, HCM 553,

SUMMARY

Garrison appeared on Dutch TV on 22 February 1968. He
continued -- in fact, escalated -- his attack upon CLA in a persuasive
performance. There is'a possibility of a follow-up program in
Holland and replays elsewhere in Europe. Garrison's interviewer,
William L.Oltmans, isa Dutch pro-Communist, although he pretends
not tobe, and a homosexual who seems to be or to have been intimate
with ex-President Sukarno of Indonesia.

Consideration is being given to forwarding to the Station at \
Jague/overt derogatory information about Garrison from the U.S.
press and TV/radio interviews for release to CA assets there.

DETAILS

1, References state that on 22 February 1968 Garrison
appeared on Dutch TV (Dutch Television Foundation, NTS) during
prime time for one hour (time not stated). Neither reference explains
whether Garrison travelled to The Hague or whether the show was
taped in the U.S. and sent on tape to Holland. The Dutch desk believes
that the latter is true.

2. .The following were Garrison's charges:

a. Kennedy was murdered because he favored a
detente detrimental to the interests of the "military-
industrial complex".

b. Kennedy was the victim of a GIA plot. CLA
has made common cause with the military-industrial
establishment because of a vested interest in maintaining
the cold war.

¢..GIA is committed to the land war in Asia,
whereas one of President Kennedy's last orders directed
a eduction of troops there.

4.-.A'U.S. president who brings the U.S. to the
brink of peace will suffer Kennedy's fate.

e. Asked why the program had been designed for
a European audience, Garrison said that the growing
influence of CIA on U.S, media had made it impossible for
him to be heard in his own country.

3. Reference A says Garrison, calm and composed, was
sufficiently credible to élicit rather favorable reviews from generally
well informed Dutch newspapers. "Several Dutch viewers also
commented on the credibility /“of / his person and presentation.
Likely that the NTS will try to sell this program to other European
stations."'

4. Reference B says that the Dutch press was generally favorable

and that many comments noted he seemed logical and in control of his
facts. The majority opinion among Embassy, USIS, an
cat-Phe-Haguh is that he seemed credible to a large proportion of the

Dutch viewers. (SYMPATHIZER 17 feels that the program created an
all-time low in the U.S. image in the Netherlands. Dutch TV alluded
to a third part of the interview, still to come.

5. Garrison was interviewed by William L. Oltmans. A
synopsis regarding Oltmans follows:

a. DPOB 10 June 1925 Huizen, The Netherlands.

+ 2,0, bs Studied at Yale 1950 but expelled for unstated
misbehavior.

2 c. ‘Thereafter worked briefly as correspondent
for U.P. and for Dutch paper De Telegraaf but dismissed
by both for unstated cause.

d.. An FBL report of 1960 states that he calls
himself anti-Communist but expresses the views “of a
great admirer of communism".

,¢. An I&NS report of 1961 lists his address for
1956-1961 as 118-09 83rd Ave., Kew Gardens, Long Island,
New. York.

£. A CIA report of 1961 lists him as a UN
correspondent then planning an unsponsored trip to East
Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Dutch
corfespondents said that they had yet to see a story written
by him. When he applied for membership in the UN
correspondents association, he was unable to produce a
single clipping in support of the application. He travels
extensively. He has excellent contacts in all Communist
countries including Cuba.

ig. ‘The Haague Post of 15 April 1951, with a
nationwide readership, characterized Oltmans as an
intimate friend of the then President of Indonesia, Sukarno,
and as having tried for five years to arrange contacts
for Sukarno in Holland.

h, An FBI report of 24 November 1961 restates
the above and adds that he had been separated or divorced
from his American wife 18 months earlier because "the is
not a man". He was living with a male at the time of the
report, 5

i. An FBI report of 1 February 1962 includes an
interview with the ex-wife Frieda Bieling (she had remarried).

She said that her ex-husband and President Sukarno

were close friends and that he wrote to Sukarno at .
least once a week throughout their marriage. Around
1957'she and Oltmans lived at the Paramount Hotel,

New York, for a time. The Indonesian government

paid their bill, which was more than $300. She met
- Sukarno through her husband in May 1959 in Copenhagen.
At the time of the introduction Sukarno cleared the

room of all advisors and bodyguards, then said to her,
"So you are Frieda. Well, Iam Sukie." He told her
“that he looked forward to receiving his weekly messages
ford her husband and that he always read them just
before he went to sleep while he was in bed." She said
that'ten minutes after her wedding ceremony with
Oltmans was over, she was alone. Her father, she

said, learned that Oltmans had a police record for
molesting young boys in Amsterdam. She obtained a
Mexican divorce in 1960. She said that Oltmans is at
least intellectially a Communist and believes Communism
to be the ‘eéonomic system of the future.

j- (HAGU?-1365, 24 October 1966, says Oltmans
wrote pro-Lumumba articles in 1960, visited Guba in 1962
and perhaps 1963, developed friendly relations with
Chicoms at The Hague and may have visited China in 1964,
In August 1966 he applied for a Chicom visa at The Hague.

k. An FBI report of 12 May 1967 says that Oltmans
claimed to have written for Ramparts an article about CIA
in Indonesia. No such article has been found.

6. Reference B requested background information about
Garrison's mental health and performance as a public official. A
summary of derogatory information from overt U.S. media for the
past year (March 1967 to March 1968) has been compiled in response.
A decision will soon be made as to whether part or all of this material
may be sen’
