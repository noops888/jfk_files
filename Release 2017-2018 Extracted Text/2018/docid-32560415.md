fied as CARL PAPPY IPPOLITO, CHARLES TOURIN aka The Blade, !
and an individual named DAYLIGHT, It should be noted that i
in July 1959 ANGELO BRUNO's wife told a confidential source
of.information as previously reported that BRUNO's invest-= !
ments in Cuba totaled approximately $180,000, In April 1960
BRUNO's wife told the same informant that most of the money : |
invested by BRUNO in the gambling casino in Cuba had been i
obtained by him but this informant did not knowhow BRUNO i
was able to bring this money out of Cuba. This information
was furnished to PH T-6.

Previous investigation has established that
BRUNO is one of the persons interested in the holdings
of the Hotel Plaza gambling casino in Havana, Cuba.

: On October 18, 1960, BRUNO advised T-4 that 1
he had arranged through Lloyds of London and an undisclosed Hit
insurance agency to insure his gambling casino in Havana :
for an unknown amount. The insurance agent accord to :

BRUNO manipulated the papers so that BRUNO received $180,000.

T-4 advised that BRUNO was impressed with the insurance ‘
agent's refusal to accept $20,000 for this "favor." T-4 :
was told that there had been a fire at the gambling casino
after which it was discovered that the insurance premiums

| had not been paid at the time of the fire. T-4 also stated

| that MARIO MA@GIO told BRUNO recently that CAPPELLO (phonetic ) |
| had been constantly trying to contact BRUNO about ‘a "reorganization. zl
