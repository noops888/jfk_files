LA ROCCA residence, is Margiotti and Casey, attorneys, 720 Grant

4310 Vista View, West Mifflin, Pa., paramour

Of SEBASTIAN JOAN LA ROCCA, Pittsburgh top hoodlum, was

interviewed at length by SA ROBERI A.

VOEGE on February 19, 1958.

She advised that she has known LA ROCCA and his brothers for

approximately fourteen years, having met "Big John"

, as she calls :

him, when her brother-in-law extended LA ROCCA credit for

automobile gasoline.

This brother-in-law, whom she did not

wish to identify further than to say his name is "CHANCE"

and that he had served time at the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary,

operated a filling station on Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh

at that time.

who is approaching thirty years of age,

said LA ROCCA "had eyes for her"

when she was sixteen and that

she has always appeared at least five years older, than her actual

age. She said he has approached her on more than one occasion

during the past three years and asked her to be

"his girl" but that

she has not seen her way clear to take him up on this proposal.

She said she has met his wife, a very retiring and suppressed

woman, and has always admired LA ROCCA for his conservative and

gentlemanly manner.

His proposal was made more difficult, she

admitted, by the fact that she has been

"going steady" for

approximately nine years with JOE FOREMAN, a Pittsburgh racketeer

who does not care for any of the East Liberty "musclemen", as he

calls them.

the youngest of fifteen children born to a mother who came

to the

United States from Hungary when eighteen years of age,

recalled that approximately seven or eight years ago FOREMAN

LA ROCCA had avehement disagreement over a property settlement

and that MIKE GENOVESE and his brother "PHIL.'

, also known as FELIX,

were sent to see FOREMAN as a threat to a "going over"

She said

FOREMAN prevented violence by contacting LA ROCCA directly and

challenging him to a personal fight and that he has referred to the

GENOVESE boys as "musclemen" since that time.

advised that she is an accomplished waitress who has

worked

ab all

the best places in Pittsburgh and is a member of the

local union. For the past three years and up until two weeks

prior to this interview she was the main waitress in the Genovese

Cocktail Lounge at 412 Lariner Avenue.

She also worked at the

Holiday House

in Monroeville for a

time during 1957 and 1s

acquainted with the Italian element operating

that establishment.

She intinated that she accept..

on a selective basis and

prefers racketeers who are willing to spend a great deal of money

on her'

She placed "Young John": LA ROCCA in this category and

stated

FOREMAN. "Young

that she preferred to date him more than anyone else except

John" was described by

Jas being "Big John!'s

younger brother who controls the rackets in Uniontown, Pennsylvania

with an iron hand."

She said "Young John" telephones her long

distance regularly and that she is his date whenever he arrives

in Pitosburgh for a meeting with other racketeers.

She said he

is divorced, has children and 1s a "very eligible catch."

She said

LA ROCCA's other two brothers, JOE and ToNy are barbers in the

Pittsburgh vicinity having absolutely no die in with the rackets,

to her knowledge.

Weddi

seemed disconcerted during the interview because of the fact

Chat her boyfriend JOE FOREMAN was on trial in Allegheny County

cours for burglary, receiving stolen goods, and illegal possession

advised that he is a used can salesman on Baum

Boulevard, is married and has four grown children.

FOREMAN

telephoned her during the

interview and expressed the wish that he had

money to "buy off someone" because he felt that he was being

"railroaded"

on the burglary charge.

advised that she quit at the Genovese Lounge because she had

to wash dishes and because the GENOVESE brothers seemed to be

getting "tight" financially. She said there has been very little

business at the lounge "since that Apalachin thing"

and that she

was unable to clear even four dollars a night in tips.

She

estimates that a waitress with obligations must clear at least

seven dollars a day in this regard in order for it to be profitable

to work at all.

she recalled receiving a telephone call approximatély three to four

weeks prior to this interview from Mrs. CARMELLA GENOVESE in

California who wanted to speak person-to-person to MIKE GENOVESE,

from whom she is divorced.

It should be noted that at about this

same time CARMELLA GENOVESE was interviewed by Bureau Agents in

California and she was uncooperative in furnishing information

about her former husband.

recalled that at Christmas

time, 1957, the entire GENOVESE

family, including the mother and father of the GENOVESE brothers,

gathered

in the dining room of the lounge and that she received

a large tip for serving them

his

brothers

and LA ROCCA want to keep him "clean." Informant

advised that ARCHIE NELSON; another of Pittsburgh's top hoodlums,

does not attend the meetings either, nor do "BOOTS" BELLINI,

a numbers baron, and CHUCK TEEMER, another Pittsburgh top

hoodlum.

All of the aforementioned individuals have been

observed by the informant at the lounge

Informant advised that arrangements had been made for a close girl

friend of the informant to purchase a car through HYMIE MARTIN,

approximately two weeks prior to this interview, but that the

informant had seen none of the other racketeers recently with

the exception of PHIL and FIORE GENOVESE,

"JO JO" PECORA and

LOUIS VOLPE, who frequents the Holiday House almost nightly.

The informant had no knowledge of the numbers or "sports book"

arrangements of the GENOVESES but had recently received a

telephone call for PHIL GENOVESE from a Jewish racketeer working

along Fifth Avenue to whom PHIL ostensibly owes money.

Informant

could not recall this individual's name but promised to endeavor

to locate it among some check stubs on which a notation was made.

Informant recalled that during September or October, 1957, two or

three racket men from New York City visited the Genovese

Cocktail Lounge and were closeted with the GENOVESE brothers

and LA ROCCA for a period of time. Following the meeting,

one

of these men, who introduced himself as JIMMIE (last name

unknown), spoke with the informant for sometime.

Informant

described JIMMIE as an immaculately dressed Italian man in his

fifties and thinks his name can be determined through PHIL

GENOVESE, who has confided in the informant during the recent

past.

Informant advised that PHIL OF FELIX GENOVESE, as he is sometimes

called, is definitely not "top dog" in the GENOVESE family

although he is close to the MANNARINO brothers.

In the opinion

of the informant,

his overindulgence in extra-marital relations,

his preference for drinking great quantities of scotch, and his

from ever obtaining

Mölent temper and sirog a factios will erevent pHIL GENOVISE

status in the group.

Informant advised

that a girl named EVELYN, whose nickname is

"PEPPER", and who

is employed on a part-time basis as a waitress at the Merry-Go-Round

Restaurant In Pittsburgh is known to everyone as "PHIL's girl"

and no one else dares to touch her. Informant advised that PHIL

GENOVESE dates EVELYN two or three times a week openly and helps

support her.

According to the informants the 1957 Ford now being

driven by PHIL GENOVESE was given to him as a Christmas gift

by KELLY MANNARINO, Pittsburgh top hoodlum, in December, 1956.

The informant advised that the girlfriend of "BIG JOHN" LA ROCCA

whose name is not recalled, died approximately ten years ago

from an illness which LA ROCCA tried to cure by securing the

best medical aid money could obtain. Informant advised that

MIKE GENOVESE is a quiet individual who does not date openly

but

forces his common-law wife ALICE to remain home alone

constantly in a house "in the middle of nowhere."

Informant

advised that none of the wives of the racket men accompany

them at their hangouts and seem to be reconciled to remaining

in the background while their husbands date and support other

women openly.

GEORGE "MOON" MESSER, a well-known and self-admitted Pittsburgh

numbers writer who is now sixty-three years of age, was inter-

viewed at his residence, 124 Elysian Street, Pittsburgh

(Emerson 1-6684 or Emerson 1-5332) by SA VOEGE on February 27,.

1958.

• He

advised that he began his numbers activity during

"the old clearing house days of 1928" and is still active in

this regard.

He said that most of Pittsburgh's present day

big racket men once depended on him solely for protection

purposes since he knew local and state police figures and

recalled that JOHN LA ROCCA was one of these racketeers.

MESSER

stated that LA ROCCA became acquainted with him in about 1941

or 1942 when LA ROCCA was handling all the numbers activity in

the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh and had set himself up

as a "little God."

When LA ROCCA became dissatisfied with his

financial gains he left Pittsburgh on a trip to Chicago to see

friends about paste reel machines with which he felt he could

make more money.

MESSER said a paste reel was similar to a

"one-armed bandit" with the exception that a small paper-wrapped

mint was dispensed after the coin was placed in the slot and the

play was registered. Its chicago manuracturers got around the

"strictly for gambling purposes"

phraseology in the law in that

manner, he explained.

While LA ROCCA was in Chicago MESSER moved into East Liberty

and

took over the entire numbers operation. He turned in to

GEORGE CHRISTY (now deceased) in Pittsburgh. When LA ROCCA

returned he became angry at the MESSER move and had a car run

over MESSER

MESSER got out of the hospital he found his automobile had

numerous bullet holes in it.

Because he thought he'd make money

MESSER stayed in East Liberty and actually forced LA ROCCA out

of the numbers business.

MESSER recalled that SAM LEVINE, a

-29-

56792 DocId:32333121 Page 7

## Page 8

PG 92-226

Pittsburgh top hoodlun,

turned in to him during the early numbers

days but said

that he has not seen LeVINE in years, although he

taniliar with his Mckees Rocks book. He said he was friendly

with LEVINE's brother RALPH, a promising dentist who is a United

states Army officer at present.

MESSER advised that he and LA ROCCA became friendly following

their feud and that in approximately 1943 LA ROCCA invited him

to share equally in the ownership of the Coin Machine Distributing

Company which later set up ofrices at 5746 Baun Boulevard in

Fistsburgh.

He recalled that LA ROCCA was completely bankrupt

because at numbers setbacks but managed to raise enough money

to put up his share.

for she purchase of the machines and made a verbal agreement with

ARI ROONEY, who allowed him to place the machines throughout the

East Liberty, Homewood and Garfield

sections and in other areas

where: ROONEY

was not operating

According to MESSER, ROONEY,

the presens owner of the Pittsburgh Steelens professional

football club, was the only man who could get paste reels before

LA ROCCA Cried, and

controlled the entire Fistsburgh vicinity in

this regard.

MESSER said the Government placed $100 tax on each

machine and that the ciby put a $50 bax stamp on each machine.

He said the osher owners of she company in'addiston to himself and

LA ROCCA, WerE

FRANK AMATO, a Pissburgh top hoodlum,

MC CINDEX, SAM MANNARINO, a Fibbsburgh top hoodlum, and F. W. ZOGG

fron Chicago.

MESSER advised that the company was doing well finaricially before

Allegheny County authorities raided establishments where the

machines had been placed and forced it out of business. He

recalled that although each of the six owned an equal share in

the company MANNARINO and LA ROCCA seemed to run everything and

held meetings at which important subjects

were discussed in Italian.

AMATO and several other Italians attended these meetings but MESSER

did not understand Italian. He advised that he realized that

LA ROCCA was only using him for his proven protection methods and

did not mind as long as he got his cut out of the profits.

said his chief protection was the then Superintendent of Police

SCOT TO

MESSER recalled that during 1946 or 1947 MIKE GENOVESE came on

the scene.

MIKE had been a pickup man for LA ROCCA and was a

tough

kid who, according to MESSER, "was almost begging to go to

jail."

## Page 9

PG: 92-226

MESSER,

who admittedly ran "moon and numbers

early thirties and was well acquainted with "Big Mike" SPINELLI,

who killed ARTHUR, JIMMY and JOHNNY VOLPE, advised that there

Is absolutely no numbers organization in the metropolitan

Pittsburgh area. He said that there are numerous independent

books which are well distributed and that there are no con.

cessions or defined areas.

MESSER stated that anyone with

money can operate as he pleases and that the police prefer

it this

way because they can collect protection money easier.

He said the police will not allow any organization now.

MESSER advised that at one time he saw "Monkeyface Joe" ROSA,

FRANK VALENTI and TONY RIPEPI, all top hoodlums, daily, but

that he has gotten away from the Italian element now with

the exception of the CENOVESES and NELSON. He recalled that

VALENTI and RIPEPI visited the offices of the Coin Machine

Distributing Company regularly and always. took orders from

MANNARINO and LA ROCCA.

He said RIPEPI was a more important

racket man than VALENTI and that LA ROCCA seemed to be the key

man in the Pittsburgh area.

MESSER would place LA ROCCA and

MANNARINO as the two men who control the rackets in Western

Pennsylvania and he sees MIKE GENOVESE as the logical successor

the top position.

MESSER, who drives a 1955 blue and white Oldsmobile sedan,

1957 Pennsylvania license E3914, recalled that in about 1947

Labor leader NICK STIRONE visited the company offices to visit

his close

friends LA ROCCA and MANNARINO.

He asked SAM MANNARINO

to get "gorillas" to handle some men who were giving STIRONE

labor trouble on a highway being built in the Monroeville section

and more specifically to give the dissenters a "going over"

while upsetting their equipment.

The job was done for STIRONE

by MANNARINO who became incensed when he learned his gorillas

had hurt some older Italian men.

MESSER said MANNARINO was under ai

the

impression that the men who had defied STIRONE were young punks

and he let STIroNE know what he thought of him in front of MeSSER

TRAVEL

T-3 advised that MIKE GENOVESE had left town during the early

portion of February, ostensibly with his wife, and that he

learned from other racketeers that GENOVESE and LA ROCCA went

to Florida and were there during the months of February and

March, 1958.

It was his opinion that they might remain there

until after a Pittsburgh Grand Jury to investigate rackets has:

finished its deliberations.

It should be noted that MIKE

GeNovest and his wite returned to the Pittsburgh area auring

the first week of March, 1950 and that T-7 subsequently

advised

that it was rumored among the Pittsburgh racketeers

that they had been in Cuba as well as Florida.

On March 24, 1958, JUDD MECHLING, Chief Deputy U. S. Marshal,

Pittsburgh, advised that when Deputy Marshal RAY ECHEMENT

tried to serve a subpoena on the subject at his residence on

that date, he was informed that the subject was

"vacationing

down south and would definitely be home for the Easter season. "

He advised that ECHEMENT contacted Mrs. JOHN LA ROCCA in this

regard

and was created very cordially, although he was not

allowed to enter the house.

on this same date SA ROBERT A. VOEGE observed the 1957 cream

colored Cadillac belonging to the subject parked in his garage

and 16 still bore 1957 Pennsylvania license 1lFMl.

The

Albany office advised on March 15, 1958 that TROY WILLIAMS,

Manager of the Arlington Hotel at Binghamton, N. Y., had advised

SA PATRICK A. MUNLEY on February 21, 1958 that all records

pertaining to the subject had been taken by an investigating

committee but he recalled the fact that the subject and (FNU)

GENOVESE were at the hotel on November 14, 1957, the date of

the

Apalachin meeting, and had two bedrooms and a living room

which would call for a rate of $22.00.

He stated that the

rooms were paid for in cash and were not charged to Canada Dry

Bottling Company of Endicott, N. Y.

He related further that

there was only one telephone call placed from the rooms occupied

by the subject and that call was to Pittsburgh telephone

Forest 4-5296, which is

He

stated that he had located a duplicate telephone ticket which

shows the call was made on November 13, 1957 but he advised

that the telephone operator evidently was in error in view of

the fact that the subject registered at 8:58 AM on November 14;
