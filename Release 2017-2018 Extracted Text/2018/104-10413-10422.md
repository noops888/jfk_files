2 May 1977

SUBJECT: Review of Mexico City Station Files
| at the Warrenton,Record's Center

1. On 2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
visited the Warrentom Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
and pertinent notations re re-use of the old folders:
