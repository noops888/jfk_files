MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI Liaison
FROM : SR/CI/R

SUBJECT 3 ° Questions Concerning Defectors
Joseph J, DUTKANICZ (201-289236) and
Vladimir O, SLOBODA (201-287527)

1. DUTKANICZ's Army assignment at time of defection,

USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2 (copy attached) confirms
DUTKANICZ's assignment to the 32nd Signal Battalion in Darmstadt.
However, his wife indicated that he had CIC connections. In an interview
at the American Embassy Moscow on 5 December 1961 (cited in DBA-288,

24 January 1962), she indicated that their trip behind the Iron Curtain "had
been made possible because her husband worked for the CIC and was allowed
to do things the ordinary 'GI' could not do." There are also penciled no-
tations in the 201 file suggesting that his Army assignment may have included
intelligence functions of some kind.

2. Previous KGB connection of both defectors.

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ himself
told American Embassy officials in Moscow that he had been approached by
KGB representatives in a bar near Darmstadt in 1958 and had accepted
recruitment as a result of their threats and inducements. He claimed to
have given them minimum cooperation from then until his defection, although
the Army considered it probable that he had done more than he admitted. A
further indication of his KGB involvement before defection is the fact that the
special decree granting him Soviet citizenship was enacted three months before
his arrival in the USSR; see Emb tel 851.

SLOBODA's prior KGB involvement was confirmed by BEVISION,
as reported in YT-1192. See attached memorandum of 28 March 1962 in
regard to passage of this information to the Army. Further indications are
the facts that SLOBODA was a KGB resettlement case and that he later told
an American Embassy Moscow official that he had been blackymailed and
framed into going to the USSR. See Moscow Emb tels A-572, 23 October 1962,
and 851, 23 March 1962.

3. Army security investigations as immediate cause of defection.

Per USAREUR Case Summary 2-62-2, DUTKANICZ told American
Embassy Moscow officials that he had informed his KGB handler that he was
under investigation for security reasons. He defected soon after, in accord
with a KGB suggestion that he do so.

SLOBODA's defection was precipitated by increased Army
security measures, according to BEVISION.

Summary

Dutkanice claims ho was recruited by representatives of Scviet
intelligence in West Germany during 1958. A combination of threats and
inducements' were used to gain his cooperation. He admits having had
four meetings with his Soviet handlers during a two-year period, but
claims he supplied only limited infcrmation to the KGB. There are, how-
ever, substantial indications that the compromise was greater. His
espionage activity was terminated by his defection to the USSR in June
1960. He was subsequently exploited for propaganda purposes by the
Soviets. Details of his complicity were obtained from statements made
by Dutkanicz to US officials in Moscow.

ExT and Assignments

Dutkaniez's principal mission was to report changes in the status -
Bretesetey and Cisposition of USARSUR forces indicating possible preparations for

: hostilities. He also admits receiving detailed instructions from the -
3 SIS which probably included additional collection EEI, but he did- not *

Recruitment and Modus Operandi

In May 1960 Dutkanicz informed his SIS handler that he was being

investigated for security reasons and he was advised to apply for

leave and defect with his wife and family to the USSR via Austria and

: Czechoslovakia, Dutkanicz complied with the instructions. Contact

: with KGB representatives was established on 26 June 1960 in Bratislava,
Czechoslovakia, a short distance from Vienna. He and his family then
drove to Lvov, USSR, with a Soviet escort. He was subsequently
exploited by the Soviets for propaganda purposes. Thc actual propaganda
material was prepared by the KGB based on details furnished by

Q Dutkanicz. In March 1962 the Suviets permitted his wife to return to

| the United States, but the children were retained in the USSR. Dutkanicz

i was allowed to accompany his wife to the US Embassy in Moscow for making

the necessary preparations for her return. During this period Dutkanicz

made a statement concerning his espionage activities in behalf of the

KGB.

USAREUR Comment

i Although Dutkanicz's confession was obtained under unusual ciroum-
stances, his statements appear substantially true although obviously
incomplete. A strong possibility exists that he worked for tho KGB for «
a longer period than he admits, and it is probable that Dutkanicz pro-
vided the KGB with considerably more information than negative imminence
reports. His statement that his SIS recruiters were from Vienna-is Di
possibly correct and is supported by his alleged defection route. His
statement that he refused payment from the SIS seems unlikely, since he :
reportedly was spending considerable amounts of money before his defection.

“The case is’ of unusual significance since it constitutes one: of the most
serious known penetrations of USAREUR forces by hostile intelligence.
Also important is the fact that Dutkanicz's defection was apparently. F
Anstigated by the Soviets for es Purposes after he lost access
to. sensitive information: f

Additional reports will be prepared as information becomes available.

of SLO2ODA as a KGB acent (Y¥T-1192, 16 January 1962) and if this

Army ‘was somewhat embarrassed about this case since SLOBODA had io -
"flunked | or 5 LCFLUTTER examinations" before his defection, 80
the information had not been passed to the Army,~ As noted in YT-1192,
SLOBODA was not particularly important, according to BEVISION,

went over the hill,
