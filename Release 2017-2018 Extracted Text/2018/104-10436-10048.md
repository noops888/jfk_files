@ group of Fascists, very Amsrican, jhe is owner of a Cabaret of nudists ;

and belongs to political gangsters.: Cecilia says it is absurd thet .

they let him enter (Ruby entering Jail where OSWALD was). Julieta says

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he begen to mix with th:  -

police and newspapermn . It was perfectly planned, indeed some of the |

police probably are of the’ sam organization because Ruby mcoddenges !
aimed the gun at his chest (OSWALD's).

! Ceoilia egrees, the picture is evidence of that because the police

did not move to try to get in or anything for within a question of :

seconds there should have peen a reaction. Julieta hopes they will ‘ :

! eontinue the! ‘ investigation; at least Kennedy's brother has sent a special ‘

agent, Cecilia says everything about it. is strange as the paper stated :

they found this oharagter (Buby) drinking Coca Cola on the second floor +

; ond they just left there. Suligta adds that from the % very first

everything was absurd that he was a Commmist. Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts; because the whole thing was so perfectly |

planned ‘and that Hs e nt since the bullet was aimed at Kennedy.

Julieta believes ‘that |thia: 4s all done by extreme rightists planned ?rom

the Russian girl, Juliete’ comments: ithat. all was very well prepared, i :

step by. step to blame|the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD's |

death) everything is more couplicated and they couldn't continue (the {. |

investigation) and even the Dalles police said that with the death of | ;

OSWALD the case was closed, but the: FBI answered immediately that it wes, :

not closed, that ‘on the contrary, they had to open an investigation and !

also the Senate will name a commission to investigate,’ and Julieta hopes

they woa't be alarued| at whatever may be tumed up. She adds that eaoh |

time more details m confirm that OSWALD was @ Fascist ‘and this business of

trying to join an anti-Castro Qreanization and later poks his nose into |

the Fair Play for Cuba surely all i this was made up by the Dallas police,

who is now hiding in place provided by; CAS.| We ‘cannot guarantee ALVARADO's safety. Wealth

ECHEVERRIA: that he hed rearrested (Silvia today because he learned she was attempting to |

leave ‘Nexi! for Habana. | However, Eoheverria’ later told LEGAT that he hdd decided‘'to rearrest
Silvia to avoid any jpossibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable as 2

witness, Since we had received n9 reply td yesterday's teleprem (MEXI 7072 - pare oT above )

we have not requested Mexi gov to take! g any action against Silvia except to maintain

dnoreased surveillance of her, activities. Echeverris later denied to LEGAT that he Lad any
specific concrete evidence that she was about to leaye for Cuba, We do not now kmow which
Echeverria; statements are accurats, It is quite possible, and even probable, that contra-
‘dictory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire ‘of GOM to play down importance

of OSWALD visit, here, Mexi line still! is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

He does not volunteer eny motive for furnishing‘ info to the U. 8. Gov concerning his allegec
association with unidentified Cubans and with OSWALD, both et U.S. border and at Cozumel.

apparently ‘unusual development concerns a reportedly second letter that he has directed to
‘U. S&S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy,' wherein he, according to his own statement, stated
that he had additional info to furnish, According to ROJAS, this additional info concerned
a so-called camera which he saw in Cozumel in the possession of the unidentified Bubans and
OSWALD, which camera reportedly had adaptations jwhich could be utilized to fire about five
cartridges, which cartridges reportedly have a small gas compartment and that said gas vas
for the purpose of cutting down on the. noise made in firing said camera. He also described

MENO to cos from SKESRADUM (source): Source has been tald to drop everything else and concentrate
on Betty MORA to endeavor to find out any additional info which she might have re OSWALD and’
his activities on behalf of the Fair Play For Cuba Committee in New Orleans, Le. prior to
the assassination. (See para 264 above) In this connection it will be recalled that MORA !
Stated after the death of the President that she hoped that the FBI would not look too hard
in New Orleans because it could be very bad"for us", / Source also reported that Reva BERNSTEIN,
former Chairman of the FPFCC in Detroit, Mich., has been in Mexi for more than a month, that:
she had been in Puerto Vallerte for a month, that she had wanted to go to Playa Azul but
that she did not do so because "it was not good to do 80 - so soon after the assassination",
that she was leaving Mexi to go to Zijuatenejo. Source does not: believe she was in Puerto
Vallarta, nor that she is presently in Zijuatenejo. / BERSTEIN also told source that she had
been questioned in Detroit, prior to her departure ror Mexi, by the RCMP, but that no inquiry ©
had been made of her by the FBI or any U.S. police or investigative agency. The interroga-
tion had to do with the FPFCC, its activities in the Detroit area, and the fact that she had
reportedly acted as a mail drop for Canadian communists. This interrogation took place in
the office of her lawyer in Detroit. She admitted to source that she had, in fact, acted as.
a drop, but that she told the RCMP that she had merely acted as the addressee for “progressive
publications" for her Canadian friends. :
