A thorough review of Agency files containing

production

from

the LILYRIC photographic surveil-

lance oncration in Mexico City reveals the exis-

tance of no LILYRIC logs or production carlier

than 3 April 1967. It appears that earlier

photographs may have been destroyed in a purge of

Mexico City Station files and that the folders

for the destroyed material were re-used to for-

ward more recent photographic material to Hcad-

quarters for retention.

According to a blind nemorandum dated 2 May

suce Revich decords centey, the on

for the period ? May
