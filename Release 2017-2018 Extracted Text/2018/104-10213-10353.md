SUBJECT: Response to HSCA Request of 25 July 1978

1. A thorough review of Agency files containing
production from the LILYRIC photographic surveil-
lance operation in Mexico City reveals the exis-
tance of no LILYRIC logs or production carlier
than 3 April 1967. It appears that earlier
photographs may have been destroyed in a purpe of
Mexico City Station files and that the folders
for the destroyed material were re-used to for-
ward more recent photographic material to Head-
quarters for retention.

2. According to a blind memorandum dated 2 May

1977, subject: of Mexico City Station
Files at the Records Center, the LILYRIC
folder which contained photographs and

logs for the period 23 July through 30 November
1963 had been re-used to store LICALLA photographs
and logs for the period 2 May through 30 June 1967.
{Cf. Blind memorancun dated $ Nay 1977, subject:
Photograph Records of the “Unidentified Man" Who
Was in Mexico City during October 1963.]

3. The above infornation is contained in a soft
file entitled: Photograph of Unidentified Indivi-
dual in Mexico City. This folder has been reviewed
by the following HSCA staff menbers:
13 March 1978 - Dan HARDWAY
10 April 1978 - Michael GOLDSMITH
- Robert GENZMAN

4 May 1978 - Edwin LOPEZ
