of Transcontinental, S.A.) who was at the Eotel Capri in

government officials there.

5. A usually reliable source has reported a conversation

about the possibilities of re-shipping goods to Cuba througa
Brazil. HERNANDEZ said that RuberrSUAREZ Y-Alvarez, representative
in Hexico of the Cuban Bank of Foreign Commerce, would go to
Brazil about 4 November to study the situation there. If
SUAREZ thought it worthwhile, they might send a shipment large
enough to merit the transport price through Brazil,

The following report was compiled from informa-
tion obtained by Agency officers from persons who were
parties, to the actions described. Agency officers mad
clear to each of the sources that the United States .
Government would not, under any circumstances, condone .
the planned actions. Presumably the sources of the .

report, in submitting this information, were motivated.
in part by the belief that by disclosing the information
they would obtain immunity. against legal action should
they succeed in implementing the plan.

2. <A Cuban exile was approached on 2 March 1964 by

expenses of five men involved in the mission.

The Cuban
exile commented that he believed he had been approached
with this plan because of his family's wealth; he told

that an approach might be made to someone who has much more
money, .

3. Another Cuban exile reported that ByroaCameron,
owner and operator of the M/V CAYMAN HOPE, whose address
4s Caribe Trading Co,, Ltd., Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, met
with several Cuban exiles on 3 March 1964. Among the 7
persons attending the meeting were Teofilo Babun-Franco,
wner of the Antillean Marine Shipping Corporation,

Miani, and two of Babun's employees, Oscar-Fernandez
Viego and Eliseo“Gomez Fernandez. Babun and Cameron are
friendly shipping-business competitors in the Caribbean
area, During the course of conversation at this meeting,
Cameron mentioned that he was in contact with an unidenti-

ied group which would be willing to assassinate selected
Cuban officials for cash; specifically, the Cameroh group

is interested invassassinating Fider Castro, Raul,Castro,
and-Ernesto “che” “Guevara.” : .

4, After a preliminary discussion at the 3 March
meeting, it was thought that the amount of $150,000 for
the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $5,000 expense
money, payable in advance, was too high, and Babun felt
that this situation was just another attempt to swindle
patriotic Cuban, exiles, Another meeting was then held
‘on 5 March and a counter-offer of $100,000 was made for
the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $2,500 for ex-
penses, payable in advance. Cameron promised to check
with his contacts after returning from a trip to the
Caribbean,

5. During a meeting on 15 March attended by Cameron
and Babun and his associates, the following terms were
agreed upon for the assassination of the Cuban officials:
Fidel Castro, $100,000; Raul Castro, $20,000; Ernesto
"Che" Guevara, $20,000; and $2,500 for expenses, payable
in advance. The time-limit for the proposed mission
would be 90 days from the date when Babun could verify,
to the satisfaction of Cameron, that he had $100,000 at

- his disposal for the payment. The contract for payment

would be honored only upon the presentation of evidence
that the three Cuban officials died at the hands of the
assassins connected with Cameron's contacts.

6. In early April 1964 Eliseo Gomez Fernandez met

with Jose "PepinBosch. Bosch agreed to advance $100,000
and Babun and hi associates would advance $2,500 for
expenses. Julio-Lobo-Olavarria, a wealthy Cuban exile
in New York, subsequently agreed to the terms, provided
that his name was not involved. Accordingly, Babun gave
Cameron $2,500 on 25 April, Cameron then advised his
group, and on 25 April he reported that his group had
already called its man in Cuba and told him to proceed
as planned and that "their other man" would be heading
for Cuba shortly. The final comment was "we hope to
have some ‘good news for you between 20 and 25 May."
Lobo planned to fly to Miami on 19 May to arrange for
the transfer of $100,000 to a safety deposit box, the
keys to which are to be held jointly by Cameron and a
confidant of Lobo.

7. The identities of the persons in the Cameron
group and how they plan to proceed with this mission
are not known, Babun's associates are reluctant to
make any unnecessary queries because they have invested
$2,500 and because Cameron made it fairly clear_at the
beginning that the, Mafia.was involved. Cameron re-
vealed during the negotiations that his contact was a
police officer in the St. Louis, Missouri, Vice Squad
who was about to retire and who has numerous connections
in the Mafia. Cameron implied that "the other man" in
question is in Spain, Cameron knows that he could be
indicted for conspiracy and that if there is any
treachery on his part, Babun and his associates would
not hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPE,

8. In late May 1964 a prominent Cuban exile who
spoke with Jose "Pepin" Bosch reported that Teofilo
Babun and Eliseo Gomez had a plan under way to assas-
sinate Fidel Castro for the payment of $150,000. Bosch
Claimed that he had committed himself to furnish
$50,000 and that he was hoping he could get the balance

of the money from the United States Government or from
other sources, Bosch indicated that he believes that a
quick, change for the better in the Cuban situation can

be brought about only by the physical elimination of
Fidel Castro and that his elimination is well worth
$150,000. In pursuing his attempts to raise an additional
$100,000, Bosch is planning to ask Julio Lobo to con-
tribute at least $50,000.

an agreement on Cuba, as promised by the Soviets, has

increase in anti-Communist pressure within

behind this pressure are Juan-Almeida, commander of

1. The following unevaluated information was received
by another office of this Agency from an untested Ce

a. On 18 April 1962 source reported that Jose
Antonio DIEZ Genova, an opportunist but not neces-
sarily a Communist, was known by him to be a "Chivato”
(informant) and is now in the United States. Re- a
portedly Subject was administrator of the Fiscal {. \
Zone of Sentiago de Cuba under the Ministry of and
Finance with his office in Calle Lorainne (middle
of block). Source described him as white, 35 years *
old, 5'9" tall, 150 pounds, short light brown hair,
dark brown eyes, large protruding ears, married

+ to Cuca PAJARDO,“and having two sons (names unknown) }
+ Bource said Subject used to live in Reparto Vista —~-*

Cani Street, Santiago.

b. Source reported that Subject informed on
Luis CUSA Portuondo, an employee of the Fiscal Zone.--:,
of Santiago de Cuba who is now hiding from the polite; :
in Habana. It was reported that Subject used to t2'ij £2,
call G-2 to tell them to be on the alert for a foat
group of six or seven in the office who were against
the regime.

©. Source said Subject departed Habana for
Miami with his two sons in about November or December

the wife of Lt. Joaquin SALHQN, a lieutenant of

the Ejercito Rebelde (Rebel Army), so that he would

“mot have any trouble. She was sent personally by

N Vf Comandante ‘Calixto,GARCIA, Chief of the Army in
Orfente Prévince, & personal friend of Subject

according to source. Reportedly GARCIA, along with

bis aide, Captain /PACHECO, lived at times in

home of Subject. 71t was also reported by source

that Comandante Juan ALMEIDA, Chief of the Army in

Matanzas’ Province, was a personal friend of Subject.

2. On 15 June 1962 the same source reported the following

additional information on Jose Antonio DIEZ Genova:

a. Source said that Subject, a Cuban refugee,
was actually an espionage agent for Fidel CASTRO.
He is now living at 9425 57th Avenue, Apt. 6-0,
Elmburst 73, Long Island, New York, and using the
name Jose_MSRTINEZ. D

ree

b. According to source, Cuca FAJARDO, Bubject's
wife, is living in Miami, Florida (address unknown)
and attempting to infiltrate the Cuban counter rev- -
olutionary forces in the Miami area in order to
obtain their plans and other information to submit
to Subject.

3. It is possible that source's definition.of "Chivato”
is an espionage agent or that perhaps source feels all
informants are espionage agents.

4. This office has no additional information concerning
the above individuals. Any further information which may
come to the attention of this office will be forwarded to the
Bureau.

2. The Ateugi Naval Air Station {s located approximately —~
+ 35 miles south and west of Tokyo, Japan, At the time in question,
Atsugi was a closed" base in the sense that American and in- .
digenous personnel entering the Station were required to possess 7 5
official identification cards, Within the Station, the Might line :
areas were restricted, as is the case of all such Stations, and
certain hangar areas were further restricted for the performance
of classified functions,

3. The Joint Technical Advisory Group (JTAG) occupied af
an area within the Station, consisting of 20 to 25 individual

residences, two dormitories, an office area, a power plant, ~ St ygt

- ea srea and there was no occasion for the regularly assigned

ilon pereonnel to visit the JTAG area, The club was open only
SeTTAG personnel and their guests, Two of the living quarters
wire occupied by the Navy commanding officer and his deputy
because the quarters at JTAG were of better quality than the
housing accommodations provided at the Station,

4, JTAG air activities were conducted from a classified
hangar area at one end of the flight ine, OSWALD did not have
access to this area, Prior to the time in question, JTAG had
been publicized by Radio Peking as being a headquarters for
American intelligence activity, For this reason, and because
JTAG was obviously not a part of the Naval Air Station complement,
there were rumors and gossip regarding the unit and its activities
This condition was regarded as normal under such circumstances,
Being there at that time, OSWALD could have heard such gossip;
however, there is no information to indicate, nor is there reason
to believe, that he obtained factual knowledge regarding JTAG and
its mission, (For your information, an incident involving the
landing of a U-2 in a rice paddy in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan,
was reported in the press and aroused some public interest, That
incident, however, occurred in December 1959, which was some
time after OSWALD had left Japan).

5. There were no Navy personnel assigned to JTAG.
Moreover JTAG did not participate in, or transfer any of, its
activities to a Station in Baagkok. Regarding the statement by
HOBBS that a Navy Commander was recruiting Navy Personnel
for an assignment in Bangkok, it is noted that the Navy at that
time wae conducting certain air reconnaissance activity from
Atsugi using other types of alrcraft.

6. The following should be considered with respect to
your source's assertions that OSWALD's squadron was in Cubi
Point, Philippine Islands in January 1958 where it kept its gear.
in what the source now knows to have been a bangar for a U-2

‘| afrplane; and that the squadron was back in Atsugi, Japan in

May 1958, The term "U-2" was not known publicly and did not

é : + gain world-wide notoriety until the ill-fated Powers mission some _ z

i two years later. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the term : l
"U~2" would have meant anything to OSWALD, even if he had bearde 1) FROM

it and had been able to identify the term with any aircraft &Gubii VL

7. To summarize: There is no evidence or indication that
OSWALD had any association with, or access to, the JTAG .
operation or its program in Japan, This applies also to information
regarding the U-2 or its mission, Even if OSWALD had seena -
U-2 aircraft at Atsugi or elsewhere, this fact would not have been |
considered unusual nor have constituted a reach of security.

Limited public exposure of the craft itself -- but not of its nomen-

clature or mission «- was accepted necessary risk. itis

most unlikely that OSWALD had the necessary prerequisites to
differentiate between the U-2 and other aircraft engaged in ‘

classified missions which were similarly visible at Atsugi at the .
same time,

Subject as above. -o4e/ jof- passs-s/5a7

1, A review of the results of monitoring Soviet foreign broadcasts
at the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD had supposedly
been taped was conducted with negative results. Therefore, it is assumed
that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facility

for internal consumption.

2. With respect to the same question, Yuriy NOSENKO was asked
if any attempt had been made by the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for propa-
ganda purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts or lectures,
NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in

Minsk. NOSENKO later reviewed this statement and confirmed it. _ ,

which would tend to corroborate or disprove NOSENKO's information
concerning Lee Harvey OSWALD, Our files contain the following
information from NOSENKO on OSWALD which may amplify or contradi
the information forwarded in reference:

ct

at
a. (1) Source was queried on the OSWALD affair on 23 January
1964. Source reported that his own Department was involved

directly with OSWALD because OSWALD came to the USSRasa 4
tourist in 1959. He had not come to special Soviet attentionin
any way until Source's Department received a report that OSWALIT

R83 had asked to become a Soviet citizen. It was implied that Source >
B 53 himself examined OSWALD's request. The KGB decided to look

Fe a. whatsoever 80 the KGB recommended that he merely go home to 8
& the U.S. as a returning tourist and there go through the formaliti
= -with the Soviet Embassy of requesting to become a Soviet citizen,

dq OSWALD then made the dramatic gesture of suicide when he
Q-« ; received this response, He had been supposed to go on a trip

the room, knocked and got no answer 60 finally they broke the~
door down and found OSWALD lying there bleeding to death.
Source himself was not present at this phase of the operatipa,
but merely read a report of it,

(2) Now worried about the possibility that OSWALD would.
do this again if refused asylum, the Soviets decided to give him
a temporary residence permit although they had no intention of
giving him Soviet citizenship, We asked why he had been sent to
Minsk and Source replied that this was merely by chance, They
had not wanted OSWALD to stay in Moscow and Minsk was chosen
arbitrarily.

(3) Asked about Marina OSWALD, Source said that she was not
& confirmed Communist and had been thrown out of the Komsomol
for not paying her dues, She had no higher thoughts than to live a
good life, have better dresses and such things, She was a stupid
woman and had no interest in improving herself, "From the Soviet
point of view she already had anti-Soviet characteristics, She was
not too smart anyway and not an educated person,”

(4) Finally OSWALD got tired of living in Minsk and wanted
to go back to the U.S. He had married Marina and wanted to take
her with him, The Soviets decided to let them go and used Marina's
uncle to talk to them and persuade OSWALD not to spread anti-Soviet
propaganda after his departure, The uncle pointed out that the
Soviet Government had allowed OSWALD to live here, that he had
married here and the Government was going to let his wife leave
with him, etc.

(5) Asked why the Government had allowed Marina to leave,
Source replied that this was perfectly natural, She was legally
married and expressed the desire to leave with her husband, Under
Soviet law there is no question but what she would be allowed to leave,

(6) The thrust of Source's account was that neither OSWALD
nor his wife had at any time been of any interest whatsoever to
/ Soviet authorities

REC oe ROM



13-00000

Soviet authorities, that there had not ever been thought...
: given to recruiting either of them as agents and that, -in
L fact, the Soviets were glad to get rid of them both, °

b. (1) During an interview on 30 January 1964, Soutee ”
- . - + €ommented that "doctors examined [OSWALD] ," and “there U
5 were no indications that he was completely a psycho,” During
an ensuing discussion of the possible involvement of the Soviet
government in the assassination of President Kennedy, Source
stated, "No matter how 1 may hate anyone, but I cannot speak
against my convictions and since 1 know this case I could
wnhesitatingly sign off to the fact that the Soviet Union cannot
be tied into this [assassination] in any way." He continued
that the KGB was frightcned of OSWALD, and would not have
discussed such a matter with him. When the possibility of !*
recruiting OSWALD was brought up, the decision was "absolutely
not." The only involvement permitted was to arrange for Marina
PRUSAKOV's uncle in the MVD [ Col, Dy& PRUSAKOV] to ask
OSWALD not to spread anti-Soviet propaganda in the US in view
of the fact that he had been allowed to stay in the USSR and was
being allowed to leave, Source commented that he was aware
that the KGB had no subsequent interest in OSWALD because
after the assassination of the President, Source had to make a
“complete investigation and even sent several KGB staff personnel
to Minsk to investigate on the spot, "not trusting official papers."

(2) When speaking of OSWALD's request to return to the USSR,
Source remarked that OSWALD "went to Mexico to apply for
permission to go to the USSR. Our people asked Moscow and we
said absolutely not because he is completely undesirable -- there
was no interest in him whatsoever.”

(3) Asked his opinion on Cuban involvement in the assassination,
Source stated that he had no information on this subject, but he did
not believe that the Cuban government was involved, He gave as
& reason that if any word of such involvement had leaked out,
Cuba would have been crushed by the US.
2. This agency has no information which would specifically corroborate
or disprove NOSENKO's statements regrading Lee Harvey OSWALD,

QUARTERLY REVIEW

+ Defense expenditures rose at more than a $4 billion
seasonally adjusted annual rate during the third
quarter of 1966—the sharpest rate of advance for
any quarter since the escalation in Vietnam began
fm the'spring of 1965. Unless the United States in-
volvement in Southeast Asia goes far beyond the
levels currently contemplated by Pentagon strate-
gists, the peak in the impact of defense procurement
on the economy may bave already been reached.
-This is not to say that the increase in defense spend-
ing is about to come to an abrupt halt or that the
rise in defense production is about to terminate.
Outstanding commitments and programs already
underway virtually ensure a further expansion of the
military establishment. However, what is most
qitical to the economy as a whole is that the rate of
increase in spending is likely to slow down consid-
erably. Even allowing for » military personnel eom-
mitment in South Vietnam of s half million men,
the advance in defense spending should become
Kittle more than a modest updrift by the summer of
1967. This implies a slippage in orders for military
‘equipment in the near future.

It ks a bit too early to find any definitive statistics
indicating that the sccelerating rate of growth in
the military establishment is about to be reversed.
To be sure, the Defense Department recently an-
nounced @ marked reduction in draft calls, but there
fs some evidence that capacity limitations at training
centers, rather than 8 programmed slowdown in the
armed forces buildup, was involved. Altbough mili-
tary prime contract awards dipped in August (the
latest reported figure) to the lowest level since
‘March, this may have been merely an adjustment
brought about by the exceptionally high level of
contract awards in July. Also, the sharp upswing in

new orders reported by defense contractors in Bep-
tember was apparently due to a large surge in civil-
fan, rather than military business.

While the current erop of statistics is difficult to
interpret and highly inconclusive, the underlying
trends implicit in the buildup of the armed forces
aod in the procurement of equipment presage ®
slowing in momentum.

Military Personnel

By the end of this yexr, American military person-
pel in South Vietnam should reach 885 thousand. -
As far as can be ascertained, current Pentagon strat
‘egy projects peak troop commitments of 500 thou-

nannies tons four months later. There are also approxi-
ly 140 thousand tons presently in transit to
Vietnam as compared with about 100 thousand tons
at the end of June. While some of the inventory in
‘Vietnam and in transit may represent a drawdown:
f stocks in other areas of the world, it is nevertheless
apparent that the inventory buildup bas been quite
extensive. Earlier this year, aircraft sorties against

‘There is also some indication that ground ordnance
—rifle ammunition, artillery shells and grenades—
may require some adjustment as well. Nevertheless,
as combat operations in South Vietnam are ex-
panded with the larger U. 8. involvement, eonsump-
tion of these items will continue to rise. However,
brass cartridge requirements for defense production
slated for the first quarter of 1967 are substantially

deployed outside
UH-1 helicopter, the ubiquitous Army and
‘Marine workhorse in Vietnam, are running in excess
ef 150 per month. Production levels here far exceed
losses both in Vietnam and elsewhere.
Consequently, sbott of a major pew escalation in
the air war in Southeast Asia, military aircraft re-
quirements should stabilize near the eurrent levels.

Summing Up

Fitting the pieces of the defense expenditure
outlook together, in the eontert of the apparent
military strategy, implies further significant increases
im expenditures during the eurrent quarter, with

1967. It appears that with the financing of a half mil-
ion troops in South Vietnam defense expenditures
would run somewhere between $70 billion and $72
Billion a year. (Buch expenditures during the third
quarter of 1966 ran at a $61.3 billion seasonally ad-
fosted annual rate.) At the present rate of expansion,
the $70 billion plus level will be reached sometime
in mid-1967, indicating a virtual flattening in ex-
penditures thereafter.

Forecasts of U8, military expenditures in recent
years have been notoriously off the mark and, indeed,
‘our expectation of a slowing in the rate of outlays
could easily go awry. Certainly, should the Vietnam
buildup be escalated beyond the 500 thousand man
Jevel or should a crisis erupt elsewhere in the world,
the outlook would be for a seemingly open-ended
expansion in our military establishment.

‘The more intriguing alternative, and bopefully
the more probable, is how much-eould military
‘expenditures be cut should 2 truce be reached in
Vietnam sometime in 1967 followed by a U.8. troop
withdrawal?

Any estimate of the extent of the reduction must
Fest upon some judgment of the cost of the war in
Vietnam at the height of our involvement. While

such estimates can be only approximate, owing to

the paucity of official information, it is nevertheless
possible to develop general orders of magnitude. If,
for example, we add the cost of aircraft losses, muni-,
tions expended, maintenance and construction re-
quirements, plus military personne! costs, not only
+ of those troops in the eombat areas, but also of

personnel in the logistic and training pipelines, we
arrive at a figure of approximately $2 billion a month.

Although at a $70 billion to $72 billion level of
defense expenditures, it might be supposed that all
costs of the Vietnam war would be met out of eurrent
expenditures, a cessation of the war is most enlikely
to bring the level of defense outlays down by a full
$24 billion, In the first instance, some of the expenses
properly charged to Vietnam, such as personnel and
basic maintenance costs of the 7th Fleet, currently
stationed off Vietnam, would go on war or Bo war.
80 would some of the eosts of the air force bases in
‘Thailand. Hence, should the war terminate and the
armed forces be reduced by nearly a million men,
defense expenditures would probably fall back to
somewhere between 2 $50 billion to $55 billion annual
rate.

The Economic Consequences of Peace

A truce and withdrawal of American troops ear-
lier this year would have come during a period of
expanding eivilian markets, Such an event would

ave contributed toa more balanced, noninflationary
growth of the economy.

Should a truce be reached after the Vietzam
‘escalation has run its course and defense expenditures
have risen to # more than $70 billion level, the de-
flationary impact on the economy could be rather
significant. A truce reached earlier this year would
probably have involved a decline in defense spending
fonly $5 billion to $10 billion. A truce reached, say.
in the summer of 1967 could precipitate a drop in
military outlays of more. than $15 ets

said in the letter that he saw this man's photograph in an article entitled
“Who's Afraid of the Warren Report" appearing in the December 1966
issue of Escuire magazine, (This photograph is identical with the photo-
graph which eppeared on page 638, volume XVI of the Warren Commis-
sion's xeport), ARVIDSON said that the unidentified man resembles
subject whom he had known in California in 1964, Upon receipt we
forwarded a copy of the letter to your Bureau and to the Secret Service.

2. The records of this Agency contain no information oa subject,
except for a report, dated 3 March 1964 captioned Harry J.DEAN received
from your Bureau on 13 March 1964, The US Air Force and Army were
unable to produce a photograph of subject so as to permit comparison
with the photograph in the Warren Commission report.

3. On ll May 1967 your Bureau furnished @ photograph of subject.
Comparison of that photograph with the one in the Warren Commission's
