(probably IgnacIo HERNANDEZ Garcia, secretary and manager

of Transcontinental, S...) who was at the Hotel Capri In

HERNANDEZ and Subject, also considered a

frequent

visitor to Cuba, reportedly had contact with high

government officials there.

A usually reliable source has reported a conversation

on 25 October 1961 between Subject and Ignacio HERNANDEZ

about the possibilities of re-shipping goods to Cuba througn

Brazil. HERNANDEZ said that Ruben SUAREZ Y Alvarez, representative

In Mexico of the Cuban Bank of Foreign Commerce, would go to

Brazil about 4 November to study the situation there.

SUArEZ thought it worthwhile, they might send a shipment large

enough to merit the transport price through Brazil.

Another Cuban exile reported that Byron Cameron,

owner

and operator of the M/V CAYMAN HOPE, whose address

Florida, met

with several Cuban exiles

Among the

persons attending the meeting were Teofile Babun Franco,

co-owner of the Antillean Marine Shipping Corporation,

Mamt, and two of Babun't employees,

Oscar Fernandez

Viego and Eliseo Gomez'Fernandez.

Babun and Cameron are

friendly shipping-business competitors in the Caribbean

area.

During the course of conversation at this meeting,

cameron mentioned that he was in contact with an unidenti

led group waich would be witting to assassinate selecte

cuban officials for cash; specificall

Castro,

and Ernesto

.. Quevara.

After a preliminary discussion at the 3 March

meeting,

It was thought that the amount of $150,000 for

the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $5,000

money, payable in acvance, was too high, and Babun felt

that this situation was..lust another attempt to swindle

patriotic Cuban exiles.

Another meeting was then beld

on 5 March and ä counter-offer of $100,000 was made for

the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $2,500 for ex-

penses, payable an advance.

Cameron promised to check

with his contacts after returning from a trip to the

Caribbean.

5. During a meeting on 15 March attended by Cameron

and Babun and his associates, the following terms were

sgrced upon for the assassination of the Cuban officials:

Fidel Castro, $100,000; Raul Castro, $20,000; Ernesto

"Che" Guevara, $20,000; and $2,500 for expenses, payable

1n advance.

The time-limit for the proposed mission

would be 90 days from the date when Babun could verify,

that he had $100,000 at

Lobo planned to fly to Miami on 19 May to arrange

The identities os the persons in the cameron

SUBJECT : Jose Antonio DIEZ Genova (aka: Jose MARTINEZ)

The following unevaluated information was received

by another office of this Agency from an untested source:

On 18 April 1962 source reported that Jose

Antonio DIEZ Genova, an opportunist but not neces-

Barily & Communist, was known by him to be a "Chivato"

(Informant) and is now in the United States. Re-

.

portedly Subject was administrator of the Fiscal

41

Zone of Santiago de Cuba under the Ministry of

Finance with his office in Calle Lorainne (micale

or block). Source described him as bite, 35 years:

tall, 150 pounds, short light brown hair,:

dark brown eyes,, large protruding ears, married

to Cuca PAJARDO, and having two sons (names unknown):.

Bource said Subject used to live in Reparto Vista

Alegre, on Calle 7 or

& on the corner of Cajetera

Cani Street, Santiago.

Source reported that Subject informed on

Luis CUSA Portuondo, an employee of the Fiscal Zone'"*

of Santiago de Cuba

who is now hiding from the police

In Habana.

It was reported that Subject used to

call G-2 to tell them to be on the alert for a

group of six or seven in the office who were against

the regime.

It was also reported by source

Subject' Man ALMEIDA, Chief of the Army 1n

Matanzas Province, was a personal friend of Subject.

On 15 June 1962 the same source reported the following

additional Information on Jose Antonio DIEZ Genova:

Bource said that Subject, a Cuban refugee,

was actually

an espionage agent for Fidel CASTRO.

He is now living at 9425 57th Avenue, Apt. 6-0,

Elmburst 73,

Long Island, New York, and using the

name JOSe HARIINEZ:

and attempting to infiltrate the Cuban counter rev-

olutionary forces in the liani area in order to

obtain their plans and other information to submit

to Subject.

It is possible that source's definition of "Chivato"

Is an espionage agent or that perhaps source feels all

Informants are espionage agents.

This office has no additional Information concerning

the above individuals.

Any further information which may

come to the attention

of this office will be forwarded to the

anion ares and there was no occasion for the regularly assigned

feation personnel to viait the JTAG ares. The club war open only

do 57 AG personnel and their gueste. Two of the living quarters

were occupied by the Navy commanding officer and his deputy

he cmase the quarter a at JIAG were of better quality than the

housing accommodations provided at the Station.

1. JTAG ir activities were conducted from a clasified

bungar ares it one end of the flight line. OSWALD did not have

access to this area. Prlor to the time in question, JAG had

been publicized by Radio Peking as being a headquarters for

American Intelligence activity. For this reason, and because

JTAG was obviously not a part of the Naval Air Station complement,

there were rumors and gossip regarding the unit and its activities.

This condition was regarded as normal under such circamstances.

Being there at that time, OSWALD could have heard such gossip;

however, there is no information to indicate, nor is there reason

to belleve, that he obtained factual knowledge regarding JTAG and

Its mision. (For your Information, an incident involving the

landing of a U-2 in a rice paddy in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan,

was reported in the prens and aroused some public interest. That

incident, however, occurred in December 1959, which was some

tIme after OSWALD had left Japan),

5.

There were no Navy personnel assigned to JTAG.

Moreover JTAG did not participate in, or transfer any of, ite

activities to a Station in Baggkok. Regarding the statement by

HOBBS that & Navy Commander was recruiting Navy Personnel

for an assignment In Bangkok, It la noted that the Navy at that

time was conducting certain sir reconnaissance activity from

Atsugi uning other types of aircraft.

6. The following should be considered with respect to

your source's assertions that OSWALD's squadron was in Cubi

Point, Philippine Islande in January 1958 where It kept Its gear.

In what the source now knows to have been a hangar for a U-?:

airplane; and that the squadron was back in Atsugi, Japan in

: May 1958.

The term "U-?" was not known publicly and did not

rain world-wide notoriety until the 111-fated Powers mission some

two years later. Therefore, it in highly unlikely that the term

U-2"' would have meant anything to OSWALD, even ll he had bearden FRui

and had been able to identify the term with any aircraft a Oubi.

SEGRET.

1. To summarize: There la so evidence or indication that

OSWALD had any association with, or access to, the JIAG

operation or its program is Japan. This applies also to information

regarding the U-2 or its miesion. Even If OSWALD had seen

U-2 aircraft it Atsugi or elsewbere, thin fact would not have been

considered usual nor have constituted a ureach of secarity.

Limited public exposure of the craft itself • but not of its nomen-

clature or mission " was accepted as a necessary sisk. It is

most unlikely that OSWALD had the necessary prerequisites to

differentiate between the U-? and other aircraft engaged in

classified missions which were similarly veible at Atsugi at the

same time.

1. A review of the results of monitoring Soviet foreign broadcasts

at the time when an interview with Lee Harvey OSWALD has supposedly

been taped was conducted with negative results. Therefore, it is assumed

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facility

for internal consumption.

%. With respect to the same question, Yurly NOSENKO was asked

if any attempt had been made by the Soviets to exploit OSWALD for propa-

ganda purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in

Minsk. NOSENKO later reviewed this statement and confirmed it.

which would tend to corroborate or disprove NOSENKO's information

the information forwarded in reference:

11992

DAY S

=(1)

Source was queried on the OSWALD affair on 23 January

1964. Source reported that his own Department was involved

directly with OSWALD because OSWALD came to the USSR as a

tourist in 1959. He had not come to special Soviet attention in

any way until Source's Department received a report that OSWALE.

had asked to become a Soviet citizen. It was implied that Source

himself examined OSWALD's request. The KGB decided to look

Into OSWALD's case to see if there was any operational interest,

which part of the KGB might have use for him and what was behin

the request. It was decided that OSWALD was of no interest

whatsoever so the KGB recommended that he merely go home to

the U.S, un a returning tourist and there go through the formalities

'with the Soviet Embassy of requesting to become a Soviet citizen.

OSWALD then made the dramatic gesture of suicide when he

received this response. He had been supposed to go on a trip

with other tourists but failed to show up for the group.

It was found that his key had not been turned in at the desk, so it

was presumed that he was still in his room.

the room, knocked and got no answer so finally they broke the

door down and found OS WALD lying there bleeding to death, 2. -

Source himself was not present at this phase of the operatipa

but merely read a report of it.

(2) Now worried about the possibility that OSWALD would

do this again 11 refused asylum, the Soviets decided to give him

• temporary residence permit although they had no intention of

giving him Soviet citizenship. We asked why he had been sent to

Minsk and Source replied that this was merely by chance. They

had not wanted OSWALD to stay in Moscow and Minsk was chosen

arbitrarily.

(3) Asked about Marina OSWALD, Source maid that she was not

a contirmed Communist and had been thrown out of the Komsomol

for not paying her dues. She had no higher thoughts than to live a

good life, have better dresses and such things.

She was a stupid

woman and had no interest in improving herself. "From the Soviet

point of view she already had anti-Soviet characteristics. She was

not too smart anyway and not an educated person."

(4) Finally OSWALD got tired of living in Minsk and wanted

to go back to the U.S. He had married Marina and wanted to take

her with him. The Soviete decided to let them go and used Marina's

uncle to talk to them and persuade OSWALD not to spread anti-Soviet

propaganda after his departure. The uncle pointed out that the

Soviet Government had allowed OSWALD to live here, that he had

married here and the Government was going to let his wife leave

with him, etc.

(5) Asked why the Government had allowed Marina to leave,

Source replied that this was perfectly natural. She was legall

married and expressed the desire to leave with her husband. Under

Soviet lau there is no question but what she would be allowed to leave.

(6) The thrust of Source's account was that neither OSWALD

nor his wife had at any time been of any interest whatsoever to

soviet authorities

Soviet authorities, that there had not ever buen thought

given to recruiting either of them as agents and that, in dis

fact, the Soviets were glad to get rid of tiem boli.

b. (1)

During an interview on 30 January 19id,

Source

commented that "doctors examined [OSWALD), " and "thorc

were no indications that he sas completely a psycho. " During

an ensuing discussion of the possible involvement of the Soviet

government in the assassination of President Kennudy, Source

stated, "No matter how 1 may hate anyone, but I cannot speak

against my convictions and since l know this case I could

unhesitatingly sign off to the fact thal the Soviet Union cannot

be tied into this (assassination) in any way." He continued

that the KGB was frightened of OSWALD, and would not have

discussed such a matter with him. When the possibility of !:.

recruiting OSWALD was brought up, the decision was "absolutely

not." The only involvement permitted was to arrange for Marina

PRUSAKOV's uncle in the MVD [Col. Dya PRUSAKOV] to ask

OS WALD not to spread anti-Soviet propaganda in the US in view

of the fact that he had been allowed to stay in the USSR and was

being allowed to leave. Source commented that he was aware

that the KGB had no subseguent intcrest in OSWALD because

after the assassination of the President, Source had to make a

•complete investigation and even sent several KGB staff personnel

to Minsk to investigate on the spot, "not trusting official papers."

(2) When spealing of OSWALD's request to return to the USSR,

Source remarked that OSWALD "went to Mexico to apply for

permission to go to the USSR. Our people asked Moscow and we

said absolutely not because he is completely undesirable - there

was no interest in him whatsoever."

(3) Asked his opinion on Cuban involvement in the assassination,

Source stated that he had no information on this subject, but he did

not believe that the Cuban government was involved. He gave as

a reason that if any word of such involvement had leaked out,

Cuba would have been crushed by the US.

This agency has no information which would specifically corroborate

A SLOWING IN THE MILITARY

• Defense expenditures rose at more than a 84 billion

mennonally adjusted annun! rule during the third

qunter of 1966-tbe nharpent rate of advance 10r

any quarter since the escalation in Vietnam began

in the spring of 1965. Unlens the United States in-

volvement in Southeast Aria goes far beyond the

levels eurrently contemplated by Pentagon trate

fists, the peat in the impact of delense procurement

on the economy msy have already been reached.

This in not to say that the increase in defense spend-

ing is about to come to an abrupt halt or that the

rise in defense production in about to terminate.

Outstanding commitment and programs already

mndermy virtually ensure a furtber expansion of the

military establishment. However, what in most

critical to the economy as s whole is that the rate of

increase in spending in likely to slow down consid-

arably. Even allowing for a military personnel com-

mitment in South Vietnam of a half million men,

the advance in defense pending should become

little more than a modest updrift by the summer of

1967. This implies a slippage in orders for military

equipment in the near future.

It is a bit too early to find any definitive statistics

indienting that the scolerating rate of growth in

the militury establishment is about to be reverned.

To be mure, the Delense Department recently at-

mounced a marked reduction in draft ealls, but there

is some evidence that empacity limitations at training

centent, rather than a programmed slowdown in the

armed forces buildup, was involved. Although mili-

tary prime contract awards dipped in August (the

latest reported figure) to the lowest level since

March, this may have been merely an adjurtment

brought about by the exceptionally high level of

contract awards in July. Almo, the sharp upswing in

Vietnam and in transit may represent a drawdow

of stocks in other areas of the world, it is neverthelens

apparent that the inventory buildup has been quite

extensive. Earlier this year, aircraft sorties against

targets in both North and South Vietnam were being

hunched at a rate of approximately 25 thousand a

month dropping 45 thousand tons of air munitions.

While the nortie rate has not risen very much above

• that level, there has apparently been some modent

increme in munitions consumption.

It thus appears that the current air munitions

production rate is running above foreseeable require

Dente Consequently, some retrenchment in output

large surplus of bombs and rockets.

There is alno nome indication that ground ordnance

as combat operations in South Vietnam are ex-

Summing Up

Fitting the pieces of the delene espenditure

outlook togetber, in the context of the apparent

military strategy, implies further significant increases

In expenditures during the eurrent quarter, with

modest increanes therenfter through the summer of

1967. It appears that with the financing of a half mil.

lion troops in Bouth Vietnam defense expenditures

would run somewbere between $70 billion and $72

billion a year. (Buch expenditures during the third

quarter of 1966 ran at a $613 billion seasonally nd-

Jarted annual rate.) At the present rate of expanson,

the 570 billion plus level will be reached sometime

in mid-1967, indicating a virtual flattening in ex-

penditures thereafter.

Forecasts of US. military expenditures in recent

years have been notoriously off the mark and, indeed,

our expectation of a slowing in the rate of outiays

could easily go awry. Certainly, should the Vietnam

buildup be escalated beyond the 500 thouand man

level or should a erisis erupt elsewbere in the world,

the outlook would be for a neemingly open-ended

expansion in our military establishment

The more intriguing alternative, and hopefully

the more probable, in how much-could military

expenditures be eut should a truce be reached in

Vietnam sometime in 1967 followed by a UB. troop

withdrawa!?

Any entimate of the extent of the reduction must

rest upon some judgment of the cont of the war in

Vietnam at the height of our involvement. While

mach entimates enn be only approximate, owing to

the paucity of offcial information, it is nevertbelen.

personnel in the logistic and training pipelines, we

arrive at a figure of approximately $2 billion a month.

Although at a $70 billion to $72 billion level of

defense expenditures, it might be supposed that all

costs of the Vietnam war would be met out of errent

expenditures, a cessation of the war is most enlikely

to bring the level of defense outlays down by a full

$24 billion. In the first instance, some of the expenses

properly charged to Vietnam, such as personnel and

basic maintenance costs of the 7th Fleet, currently

rationed off Vietnam, would go on war or no war.

Bo would some of the costs of the mir force bases in

Thailand. Hence, should the war terminate and the

armed forces be reduced by nearly a million men,

defenne expenditures would probably fall back to

nomewbere between & $50 billion to $55 billion annual

rate.

The Economic Consequences of Pence

A truce and withdrawal of American troops ear-

lier this year would have eome during a period of

expanding eivilian markets. Such an event would

probably have forestalled the stringency in the

money markets last summer and presumably would

have contributed to a more balanced, soninflationiry

growth of the economy.

Bhould a truce be reached after the Vietnam

encalation has run its course and defense expendr ures

have risen to a more than $70 billion level, the de

flationary impact on the economy could be father

Ignifenne. A truce reached earlier this year would

probably have involved a decline in defense spending

of only 85 billion to 810 billion. A truce reached, say.

In the summer of 1967 could precipitate a drop is

military outlays of more than $15 billion. Moreover,

the falloll in military expenditures might well be

occurring about the same time

it the plam and

equipment expenditure boom
