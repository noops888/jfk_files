SUBJECT: Interview with William Harvey (conducted September 14, ft ‘a

1975)

LUMUMBA'S ACTUAL DEATH

‘Ls

I do not know of any connection between the CIA and Lumumba's

actual death.

LUMUMBA PLOTS

2

I never heard of poison being sent from the CIA to the Congo

station, nor did I ever hear of any CIA assassination mission

in the Congo. I am almost sure that } never told me

that he had learned that there were poisons in the Congo.

yoswin CONGO MISSION

3.

6.

The only mention of assassinating Lumumba that I recall is

R's conversation with me.

. B only told me that he had agreed to go to the

Congo to discredit Lumumba and that he had refused to undertake
an assassination mission which Richard Bissell attempted to
give him.

I did not debrief {—] when he returned from the Congo.

So I did not learn from him what the nature of his mission was.
linn = activities in the Congo were not a Staff D opera-
tion. Despite the fact that the memo of January 11, 1960
mentions that "QJWIN was being used for FI/D purposes," QJWIN's

mission in the Congo was not a Staff D operation. Rather, it

was an African Division operation. I merely loanedf|

deputy | to| ] for his activities in the

Congo.

7. In fact, it is possible that] might not know

exactly what QJWIN did in the Congo because may simply

have arranged for WIN to be placed under the supervision of

{ and sent to the Congo.

8. The use of the phrase "FI/D purposes" in the memo of January 11,

1960 was purely an administrative device to secure funding for
QJWIN and allow for accounting out of Staff D funds. I am
almost 100% sure that there was no actual FI/D assignment.

9. It is possible. that }may have used QJWIN to aid in a

survey @ AD Co Mulewesy in the Congo. ]

f{ |the primary purpose

of "s trip was to undertake an operation against

Lumumba.

10. The specific nature of QJWIN's assignment in the Congo was

probably worked out between] land:

perhaps before he was actually assigned t

and I discussed QJWIN and his potential utility.

13. | el early use of OJWIi
QJWIN was told to "spot" people ]

{ He was

probably also told that he should spot people who were capable
of obtaining documents or packages from couriers.

14. QJWIN's instructions for asset spotting did not change at all
after Project ZRRIFLE was established as far as I know.[ |

continued to be the intermediary between myself and

QJWIN. I never met OJWIN.
15. QJWIN was not permitted to make a single recruitment as far
& as I know.

16. The lengthy handwritten notes which appear in the QJWIN/ZRRIFLE
file (a xeroxed version of a spiral notebook) were probably
written by (ie meleeniatian | in the course of debriefing QJWIN
on his asset spotting. This is a deduction on my part based
upon the handwriting and the terminology used in these notes.

17. If there was any CIA mission to kidnap Lumumba from UN custody
and turn him over to Mobutu, I did not know of it. I do not
think anyone would be naive enough to think that if Lumumba
were turned over to Mobutu, he would live through it.

18. As far as I know, QJWIN was entirely run by lat this

point. In other words, I do not know of any independent lines

of responsibility or reporting that QJWIN had to other people

a 24,

As far as I knew, neither|____—|nor QJWIN ever had an assassi-
nation mission.

If QJWIN were to be used on an assassination mission, it would
have been cleared with me. I was never informed that he was

to be used for such a mission. Nor did I ever discuss any such
mission with him as far as I know.

I was kept informed of the arrangements for QJWIN's trip to

the Congo and, subsequently, of his presence in the Congo. I

do not know specifically what QJWIN did in the Congo. I do

not think that I ever had such knowledge.

I was shown a CIA cable to Director from IN 36814,

dated November 2, 1960 regarding QJWIN's mission to the Congo

which reads, in the first paragraph: "He accepted offer.
Proceed Leopoldville. Precise mission not conveyed to him.
He only informed that mission might involve large element of

personal risk." probably wrote this cable.

This cable does not indicate any particular kind of operation,

like an assassination mission, because anyone going to the
Congo at this time would have assumed a great risk if they

were undertaking any kind of operation against Lumumba.

The memorandum of November 2, 1960

This memorandum originated filmsspaterD. It was probably written,

for my signature, ry{_ sd who would have been

sufficiently familiar with the operational details to be the

author.

to which this memorandum: refers.

After reviewing the Memorandum for the Finance Division from

“William K. Harvey, Chief, (REA sion-p" dated January 11, 1960

which concerns QJWIN's trip to the Congo, it appears to me

that this memorandum was written for my signature by

I do not know what was to be signified by thé note in my memo
of January 11, 1960: "In order to avoid any misunderstanding,
it should be noted that QJWIN was sent on this trip for a
specific highly sensitive operational purpose which has been

completed." I do not know what "completed" would have meant,

but I assume it must have referred to the fact that

had returned from the Congo.

HW 50955 DocId:32203892 Page 7


30. This memorandum of January 11, 1960 does not reflect any first-
hand knowledge on my part of the nature of mission
in the Congo.

WLIROGUE

31. Mr. Baron showed me the cable of December 17, 1960 from

Leopoldville to CIA headquarters concerning an approach by
WIROGUE to QJWIN for the purpose of recruiting QJWIN for "an
execution squad.'"" I do have a vague recollection that QJWIN
was approached in the Congo in connection with a "direct
action" operation. But it is my impression that this was an
incident involving free-wheeling by an agent, rather than an

assassination mission.

e ZRRIFLE/ROSELLI_ OPERATION

32.

Project ZRRIFLE was used for funding the Roselli operation.

Project ZRRIFLE, which began as the development of an Executive

Action capability, was later used for the accounting for the
Roselli operation. This was for the purpose of the convenience
of vouchering whatever expenses were involved and to ensure
security. This enabled me to keep the general Task Force W

operations separate from the Roselli operation.

HW 50955 DocId:32203892 Page 8

a]


r 33. The question of "reactivation" of the Roselli operation in
November 1961. In November of 1961, Richard Bissell asked me
to take over the Roselli contact. Richard Bissell's testimony,
as represented to me by Mr. Baron, that Roselli was viewed as
an "inactive contact" at that time is exactly contrary to my
recollection. I recall that Bissell simply asked me to take
over the Sheffield Edwards operation. This was not a revival
of anything that had been terminated or put on ice. The
operation had never stopped. There was no indication in any
of my talks with Richard Bissell that the Roselli operation
was dormant, But in fairness to Bissell, I don't know that he
ever said precisely that it was an ongoing operation. The
impression I received from Bissell, however, was that it was

6 : indeed an ongoing operation. There was nothing said to the
contrary. My subsequent talks with Edwards, O'Connell, and
Roselli indicated that the operation was active. But I do not
know how close Bissell was to the operation and exactly what
he knew about it. It may have been his impression that the
operation was inactive. Whatever language Bissell used with
me, it was clear to me that the operation was ongoing and that
I was to do whatever I could with it. It was also clear from
my first conversation with Roselli that the operation had never
been called off. Jim O'Connell also indicated to me that he
was still in contact with Roselli. Shortly after my discussion
with Bissell of my takeover of the Roselli contact, I discussed

the Roselli operation with Edwards. The only reason for the

HW 50955 DocId:32203892 Page 9


34.

hiatus in activity in the Roselli operation between November

of 1961 and my meeting with Roselli in New York in April of 1962
was the intensity of my other responsibilities at the CIA.
During this period, I had to set up Task Force W, including
recruiting its members. I also had to continue the ongoing
Cuban operations and write frequent memos to Lansdale and

Robert Kennedy on these subjects. When I was requested to take
over the Roselli operation, I assessed it and determined that
the operation should be terminated because it had little chance
of success. But because of the tremendous repercussion potential,
I delayed the termination. I subsequently terminated the Roselli
operation as soon as feasible after the missile crisis in
October of 1962. It would have been terminated earlier except
that during the crisis I could not cut off any potential asset.
Had I been given the original assignment of removing Castro,

this is not the way I would have done it,

Authorization through Bissell. At no time did I or anyone else

connected with the Castro assassination operation (Helms, Edwards,
O'Connell and Roselli) ever have the slightest doubt that this
was fully authorized. But my sense of the existence of this
authorization came solely from my conversations with Richard
Bissell. I had no other direct information about the source

of authorization for the operation.

& 35. Robert Kennedy. I never discussed the Roselli operation with
Robert Kennedy nor with anyone outside the CIA except for
John Roselli.
ZRRIFLE/RICHARD BISSELL
36. My initial discussion with Richard Bissell about establishing
an Executive Action capability was the first time assassination
was ever raised with me in any context other than as a subject
of general philosophical discussion.
37. The memos of January 11, 1961 and of November 2, 1960 do not
make it any easier for me to date my original conversation with
Richard Bissell about Executive Action. The ZRRIFLE cryptonym
could have been assigned before or after my initial talk with
Bissell, so the date of that assignment would not be dispositive
e of this question. I don't remember whether ZRRIFLE was a
SEMEEED cryptonym or not.
ZRRIFLE/&)

38. : I do not know in what connection Richard Bissell

raised the subject of assassinations or assassination capability

with{ sd prior to my initial discussion of the subject

with Bissell. My best recollection is that in my discussion

with Bissell, Bissell said that he had a general discussion of

assassination with in the course of which| volunteered

that al asset of his might be useful in this connection.

But had not previously used QJWIN as an assassina-

tion capability or even viewed him as such. would

HW 50955 DocId:32203892 Page 11


a2 have had to clear any such use of QJWIN with me, and he did
not. When Richard Bissell spoke to about de-
=
veloping an assassination capability, must have raised

QJWIN as a possible asset.

39. I reviewed the typewritten version of notes _

headed "Project ZRRIFLE" which were included in the QJWIN/ZRRIFLE

file. On page 2 of those notes, the following sentence appears:

The spotting activity has now advanced far
enough to justify removing from the 900A category.

"OOA" refers to "Other Operational Activities," which is a general
fund that a CIA officer maintains to pay for development of
assets, including recruitment of assets, and general support
of agent operations.

@ 40. The QUWIN file was created first in regard to WIN's recruitment
byfenittti land then in regard to WIN's activities in the Congo.

Subsequently, it was transferred to the ZRRIFLE file. ZRRIFLE

was primarily set up as a project

I distinetly told that QUWIN was

never to be told about the development of an assassination

capability. As far as I know, QJWIN never knew that the
development of an assassination capability was one of the
purposes of the asset spotting to which he was assigned.

41. I approved the asset spotting trip that QJWIN took through

in 1961.

that they possessed lethal drugs. I very probably discussed
with CREE the poisons that were available. But I do not
recall any specific conversation with (O3EELLebyon this subject.

47, Mr. Baron represented to me that Ted Shackley testified that I
had informed him in the early days of his tenure at JMWAVE
@ Station in Miami that there was "a three man group" making
decisions on Cuban operations. There was no such formal
decision-making group. I probably mentioned the three people
referred to. by Shackley -- Lansdale, Helms, and Robert Kennedy --

as three key people in the Special Group at that time.
