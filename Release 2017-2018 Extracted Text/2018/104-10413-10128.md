Subject: Background on Mexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

D coverage. From the time the Hexico Stetion vas opened in

(ABFIT1947(by_BiLI_Doyle)) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles

Anderson III.(still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to aa

exploit leads from the Soviet Eubassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps,(three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation,

a. Fhone taps were placed by ancemployee-of 1
Tetanwel we Adda ted

handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of Lines

tapped was Lintea’by availability of a listening post nearty
(since the taps were not made in the main central) and English/
Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally
these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related
(which the station et that time felt was good security in thet

if. they telked about™shop; they would talk to each’ other.)

b. Ghree photo sit

of Harry Mahoney (retired, ‘living in Chicago) and TDY TSD |

were handled by Anderson with the help

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALLA), LIMITED wes a fixed site bang opposite across

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance, The Soviet gate was on the

public by the Warren Conmission. The photo operators vere moved to another apt

It was in-an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street

as LIMITED but. in the middle of the block-South. It-had a slantdd view of

the front gate of the Soviet Embassy, The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both
Mexican fanilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment, LICALLA, the third photo site, vas located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Enbassy compound

which the Mexico Stetion purchased in about 1958 (check date), also g
LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Enbassy compound. The purpose of this opsretion was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

With this forey

2 Polish, ‘and:1 Yugoslav line, The basehouse listening post had a live

monitor who. made short summaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day around 8 a.m. (passed dy‘

@K) to Goodpasture
to get to Scott before 9.a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)
full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same way, however,
there was usually a time lag of @ day or so.’ Those transcripts which had
Russian or another languege besides Svanish or English went out of the listening
post the day. after the transeript (of other conversations on the reel)vas _
typed. These reels were’ taken to another location where they were trenslated
and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ren
about @ veek behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of :
Russian conversations among the xienbers of the Soviet Eubessy.' During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people fromthe Soviet Section or ‘they nay

have been carried to him by Flick) but I think I brought the reel in and gave |
