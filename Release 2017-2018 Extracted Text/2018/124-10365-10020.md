I. PREFACE

A. Purpose of Paper

This paper has been prepared to compare the results

of the 1967-68 interrogations of YURI NOSENKO with a CIA

paper dated February, 1968, entitled "The Examination of

the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector." This CIA paper was based

on previous interrogations of NOSENKO and concluded that

NOSENKO is not a bona fide defector

$ (4)

According to the paper, in arriving at this

conclusion the lengthy interrogations of NOCENKO, analysis

of KGB operations

which he related and comparison of his

assertions with collateral information from - ther sources

were considered.

B. Background

For convenience in assessing these papers, the

following chronology of events is set forth: (u)

NOSENKO first made contact with CIA in Geneva in

June, 1962. After several meetings he returned to Russia

and was not again in contact with CIA until his return to

Geneva in January, 1964.. On his return to Geneva he indicated

paper regarding the

Significant inaccuracies were detected in the CIA

(S)

and ABIDIAN cases.

Contrary to statements in the paper,

was not inter-

viewed about homosexual activities before he left Moscow;

did have contact with a girl at American House posing

as a

West German journalist; the Soviet maid TATYANA FEDOROVICH

did have access to ABIDIAN's living quarters within six months

after his arrival in Moscow.

COMMENT :

A number of previous CIA conclusions

regarding this period were based on deficient

interrogations of NOSENKO and inadequate

collateral inquiries. These conclusions have

been invalidated by current interrogation and

collateral Inquiries and there is no substan-

tial basis for doubting NOSENKO's basic claims

regarding this period.

1962-64 Period

It is concluded in the CIA paper that NOSENKO's

claims of being Chief of the American-British Commonwealth all

is alleged that NOSENKO did not indicate the sources from

which he obtained the information regarding the cases.

4)

During current interrogation NOSENKO provided

sources

or logical explanation for his knowledge in sixteen of the

nineteen cases referred to above. He also provided adequate

clarification regarding three of the other five cases which

were subjects of CIA criticism. In addition a current review

of his notes by NOSENKO provided the translation "ECTOR",

instead of "ACTOR'' or

previously obtained, as the

name of an agent. Collateral investigation has developed

a logical suspect by this name.

(logical suspects named

"ACTOR" or

were not previously identified.)

COMMENT :

Previous interrogations of NOSENKO in

which information was not obtained regarding

the sources for these cases were obviously

Inadequate. Current interrogations have

provided significant clarifying information. SU)

New Cases and New Information

The current interrogations of NOSENKO have developed

six new cases involving nine people which were previously not

uncovered during his interrogations. Collateral investigation

has identified six of these persons and one:

has been interviewed and admitted the allegations. This case

is considered significant corroboration of NOSENKO. 30

Additional significant data was developed on three

cases previously mentioned by NOSENKO. Data in one case (the

Brussels case) may assist in the identification of a KGB agent

Who supplied NATO codes. * 4)

Considerable interesting, new and confirmatory data

was obtained during the current interrogations. Twelve examples

are cited

COMMENT:

The new cases, new information and

confirmatory data obtained in the current inter-

rogations and collateral inquiries also clearly

establish that the previous interrogations were

deficient and collateral inquiries inadequate.

Failure to acknowledge significance of NOSENKO'S

personnel identifications and organizational data

denotés lack of objectivity in ClA paper.

In addition the "Characteristic" which was prepared

which he turned over to PHILLIP VASIIYEVICH KISLITSYN

He

described the chambermaid and furnished her code

he indicated that this was the name of

first name was probably MARIYA but recognized DORA

as the first name when it was mentioned to him. He

stated that a driver for the military attache office

was "'SHNYREV" and accurately furnished his first name

NOSENKO also pointed out that KGB obtained

considerable information from microphones concerning

operations and plans of the Military Attache personnel

including their discussions before trips, their plans

for visiting various cities and points of interest

and their conversations after their trips. In addition

KGB knew how much money they had each year for

he had turned the Ist Section files over to

VALERIY BUDYLDIN who had worked for a short

period but was later fired from KGB and the

details of this incident could be due to his

hospitalization at the time it occurred.

On page 09 1t 1s also indicated that if NOSENKO

served in the Embassy Section (Ist Section, Ist Department)

during 1953-55, "It is difficult to perceive how he could

have remained unaware of 'ANDREY'S' identity." NOSENKO

claimed that "ANDREY" was spotted by ROY RHODES and was

recruited prior to NOSENKO's connection with KGB in March,

1953.

"ANDRY"' was a crypto-repairman and the direct

subordinate of the Army Attache cryptographic security

had no intelligence connections. It was stated that inter-

but not the backeround of his case and knew the background of

The CIA paper also relates that the KGB agent GEORGE

BLAKE furnished to KGB in 1959 a 19 page document covering a

conference held in London between British and CIA representatives

outlining British and American use of tourists for intelligence

purposes. The KGB was therefore fully aware of the use of

tourists and it was stated that the substance of this informa-

tion, if not the document itself, would have been brought to:

the attention of the Deputy Chief of the American-British

NOSENKO stated that there was an analysis each

year regarding use of tourists for intelligence and

even in 1955 there were some indications of tourist

use by Americans including "little facts'' - how the

tourists acted, trying to get military information,

trying to find drops, studying candidates for

recruitment, etc. Each year they had good examples

nationalities by the Americans. NOSENKO, however,

the names of foreigners against whom KGB was working

the content of the document after GOLITZYN's defection

compromised and "i'd out." He did not believe the

It is considered probable that the 1961

In this connection it is not clear how GRYAZNOV

of the SCD would have knowledge of SMITH in the Spring

of 1960. If SMITH was an agent prior to that time he

would have been antagent of FCD. NOSENKO has reported,

however, that another friend of GRYAZNOV!s, NIKOLAY

that ABIDIAN had no maid until 16 months after his arrival

With regard to the identification of SHAKHOV

by the defectors mentioned above it is noted that

only

accurate knowledge of his connection with KGB and

both identified him as a former agent rather than an

officer.

was referring to

his name while reviewing tourist lists because NOSENKO was in

the American Department at that time.

COMMENT:

This case has not been clarified but no

ulterior motive is seen in NOSENKO's insistence

that the first incident occurred in 1958-59, if it

were not true. His insistence can only raise

questions concerning the accuracy of his

recollections.

LEE HARVEY

OSWALD

On page 309 it is stated that NOSENKO's apparent

ignorance of LEE HARVEY OSWALD's communications with the Soviet

Embassy in Washington (in efforts to return to the USSR in 1963)

discredits his claim to complete knowledge of all aspects of

the

KGB relationship with OSWALD.

it is noted that NOSENKO alleged that a telegram had been

ordering NOSENKO to return to Moscow: Eventually NOSENKO

retracted this assertion and stated that there was no recall

COMMENT :

This case was referred to in notes brought

out by NOSENKO in 1964. FBI translated the

name in these notes as "EKTER." On December 8,

1967, (N-60), NOSENKO translated the name "ECIOR"

but acknowledged it could be "ACTOR." He related

that he had noted this name when a representative

of the FCD had complained to the 7th Department,

SCD, that this name had been included in a

connunication sent by Intourist through the

open mails to various Soviet stations abroad.

F'CD was afraid its valuable agent would be

Information set forth above regarding the cases

discussed in the CiA paper has clearly indicated that the

current series of interrogations of NOSENKO in 1967 and

1968 have been much more thorough and have produced

voluminous information clarifying data obtained fron him

in previous interviers. Of particular significance,

however, in addition to that set forth above is information

obtained during the current series of interviews which is

completely new. Some of the information relates to new cases

and some of it is new information on cases mentioned previously.*

Set forth below is a summary of the most significant data

in these categories and additional new and confirmatory data

obtained during the current interrogation. This material not
