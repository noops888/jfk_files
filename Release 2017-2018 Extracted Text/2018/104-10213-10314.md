MEMORANDUM FOR : General Counsel
Director of Security

FROM : S.D. Breckinridge

SUBJECT 2° HSCA Request of 26 July 1978 -
os OLC- 78-2728

1. Attached is correspondence from the DDO focal
point on the HSCA investigation, responding to Question
£2 of reference. It states that there ure and have been
ho agreements (at least not as described in the fISCA
request) between CIA and the FBI, or other governaecnt
agencies, that pertain to the Agency's responsibilities
to report on U.S. citizens abroad who contact Coamunist
7 embassics or officials. It also states that current :
legislation forbids such reporting.

i 2. Attached are copics of Papers collected by
i O/IG during the Rockefeller Commission's inquiry; I
recall that there was a 1966 Teement, which is not ia

these papers. In any event they do not scem to contain

1 @ specific provision such as is envisioned in the report.

: It is possible that interpretations of NSCID and DCID
Provisions resulted in routine Teporting of such con-"
tacts, although there were no agreenents, per se, for
such action. Since the prozulgation of Executive
Orders 11905 and 12036 there have been limitations on
reporting on U.S. persons, which may affect past practice.
Mouever, this office is not in a position to provide an
Agency position on this issue. . .

3. It is requested that you coordinate with the
DDO in preparing an answer to an Agency response to aietin

the HSCA question. é i
