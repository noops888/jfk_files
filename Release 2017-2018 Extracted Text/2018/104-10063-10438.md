observation, provided the assessment of Mrs. Warren attached
hereto at the undersigned's request. {M-7 believes she has
hit it off with Mrs. Warren because of her understanding

of dialectics (thanks to Andy Ness's tutoring) and, consequently,
she was instructed to attempt to develop a social-business
relationship with her. With respect to the other members

of the study group, (M77 claims that the situation, to date,
has not been conducive to ferreting: out the identities of ~ a
these individuals, but. that she hopes that as the group
continues. to meet, Some rapport will be established with her
classmates. :

has formally enrolled at the Graduate Faculty of the New
School for Social Research in a course entitled “Comparative

Horn, CI7SO0, the undersigned raised the subject of the Women's

Tour which is scheduled to visit London, Paris (where they
will meet the DRV peace delegation) and Rome from 27 May -

25 June 1972 with (M-7 and instructed her to attempt to determine.

the interest in, and likely composition of, the New York
group and explore tke possibility of joining such a group
and explore the possibility of joining such a group. (37's
first reaction tothe tour was that the cost ($699, which
price includes airfare, trains, hotels, etc.) was too high.
It was explained to her that the cost factor should not

: deter her from following through. It was then that [M-7
voiced some concern that the timing of the tour may interfere
with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms of

: ie mid-May or June 1972 up to this point). It was made clear

to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for
her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well
prove to be.of operational interest, e.g. meeting the DRV
delegation and continuing the staging process prior. to her
actual departure. (M-7 said that she understood and would
look into the matter. She did not believe she would have

any difficulty in covering for funds should she find herself
included on the tour. :

‘17 February 1972
SUBJECT: Mrs. Susan Warren aka Susan Frank

Susan is a tough cookie. One of her most outstanding
features is a complete lack of interest - in anyone but her-
self. When.leading, a China study class this is her method:

. first she asks a question, from her notes, such as "What

do you think Mao meant when he sdid this.:." Then she
cldmly listens to what the class thinks Mao menat. When
everyone finishes Susan begins to tell exactly what he
meant to say. Through the evening her attitude remains
the same "I've been here before and said this before."
There is no enthusiasm in her that I coudd see. :

Susan is an expert on China. I know because she told
me. She told everyone else too within the first eight
minutes of class. “Well, I spoke to those soldiers in
Yunan who fired on those *peasants..." But she really didn't
have to advertize her knowledge because it is very apparent.
She has a solid understanding of Chinese political line and
can smoothly defend Chinese history. :

As far as the woman herself is concerned she has
not as much money as she would like. I believe she wants
to dress in 'style.‘ Now, although dressing conservatively

she still developes an eye for color and she would clearly ~~

be receptive to intelligent male attention. She has a
nice > figure and is aware of it.

Perhaps the clue which best typifies Susan‘ s personality
‘is her voice.’ It is deep, slow, even and artificially

cultured. For example, "r's" Lean "d" in "veddy" or
“Amedica".

-Her hand movements when she ‘speaks are measured and
deliberate. While listening she fidgits a little but not

. much. eae

Two noticible features are her thumbnails. Both. are
filed almost to points, are very thick and yellowish-
moreso than other nails. a :

While she is concerned with herself I believe she
would follow someone who either interested her or gently

a GO


led her. There is a part of her normally conservative
- character that would like to break away and try new things
(altho' not new ideas in politics.) : :

‘- One last remark, she is a straightforward person;
will look you in the eye, will tell someone not to speak
too long if she wantS to move on to something else.

These observations were made after one meeting in
a study class and for a few minutes before class.
