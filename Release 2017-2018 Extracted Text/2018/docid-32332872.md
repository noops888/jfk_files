Out Of Jail." In a lengthy coverage of VALENTI's appearances

before

the New York State Commission this article quoted

VALENTI as

saying he had not only met GABRIEL MANNARINO

at the meeting but had also met MICHAEL JAMES GENOVESE

of Gibsonia, Pa.

He stated there were 30 or 40 persons

at Apalachin, according to his estimate, but that there

could have been 50.

He said he only knew 4 or 5 of them

and said that he did not inquire how it was

that such a

large gathering was held in BARBARA's home in the middle

of the day during the middle of the week.

The article

quoted him as saying that he was at the BARBARA home for

about six'hours eating and drinking brandy.

It also quoted

him as saying that he was undismayed when it was made known

that State Police were on the premises and that even if

J¿ EDGAR HOOVER, FBI chief, was there he would not have been

bothered.

An article appearing in the "Pittsburgh Press" dated.

March 26, 1959,

and entitled

"VALENTIS Fail In Freedom

Bid" stated that the New York State Supreme Court had

refused on that date to set free FRANK VALENTI, eX-

Pittsburgh racketeer, and his brother, _COSTENZE, who

had been in jail since August, 1958.. It quoted Justice

EDGAR J. NATION as saying "The court is not required

to shut

its eyes to reality and accept answers which are

replies in form only but, which in substance, are as

useless

reall which

as complete refusals to answer."

a croupier at the MANNARINO gambling establishment in

He said that he has been present

at that establishment with RINALDO and that RINALDO

mentioned to him approximately 5 or 6 days prior to

the time the MANNARINOs and LA ROCCA were to appear

before the Federal Grand Jury at Pittsburgh, that

no one was to call his home under any circumstances

be bothered. He

described them only as a man and girl

and the informant

advised he never saw them because

they never left

the house but had

"CHIPS" bring in food for the girl

to cook.

He believes

they exchanged cars also and that

RINALDO drove this car to New Kensington nightly while

the couple stayed at his house.

The informant stated

that he had an idea the couple had something to do with

the Federal Grand Jury and wondered whether there was

anyone who did not answer a subpoena and could not be

located. He further advised that RINALDO has a roomin a

house almost directly across the street from the Pepsi-

Cola bottling plant near the 5700 block of Center Avenue

and answers telephone number EMerson 2-2298.

A review of the Crisscross Telephone Directory for the

City of Pittsburgh reflects that one ALFRED RONALLO

of 5717 Fifth Avenue, subscribed to telephone EMerson

2-2298. -

PG T=2 advised that on March 10, 1959, a collect telephone

call was made to the aforementioned number from GADE

RUSH, Room 411, Mayfair Hotel, Baltimore, Md., and that

number to LE 9-7640. The party was identified as

2000 TA

made from the aforementioned

GALE RUSH, Room 411, Mayfair Hotel, Baltimore.

PG T-5 advised that when JOHN LA ROCCA returned to Pittsburgh,

from the location at which he was hiding since shortly

after the Apalachin meeting in November, 1957, his youngest

brother

JOHN, who is known in racket circles as "Young

JOHNNIE" left his racket setup in Johnstown, Pa., and

spent almost 3 weeks in Pittsburgh, presumably for

conferences with his brother.. He said that

"Young JOHNNIE"

telephoned FRANCES PRIAM, Pittsburgh prostitute and

former paramour of

the subject, for dates on 3 occasions

while in Pittsburgh and was desirous of having that

individual come to

Johnstown with him for a short stay.

He said that when

"Young JOHNNIE" comes to Pittsburgn

he always stays with his brother TONY, a barber whose

children are grown. He explained that TONY is ostensibly

not connected with

the rackets in any manner and is

more lenient about late hours and carousing than is

the subject.

PG I-4 advised that the term "Mafia. was never used wher

he was closely associated with LA ROCCA, FRANK AMATO,

and the MANNARINO brothers. He said that everyone knew

these individuals during the late 1930's and early 40's

"blackhanders" and that this term was bandied about

without fear at the offices of the Coin Machine Distributing

Company on Baum Boulevard in Pittsburgh where LA ROCCA held

said that the aforementioned individuals hired

groups of "toughs" to do their work for them and that these

hoodlums of low intelligence and poor Italian background

He said that he recalls that

they were armed with cue sticks which they had ostensibly

stolen from poolrooms throughout the Pittsburgh area and

which had been sawed off to 12-15" lengths.

He explained

that the heavy end of the cue stick was used as the business

end and that a hole was bored into the bottom and lead used

as a further weight.

He said that after the lead was

inserted into the hole, the hole was corked or filled in

some other manner to make a flat surface.

The informant recalled that he was given one of the

aforementioned cue sticks as a present by MIKE GENOVESE, who

fashioned it for his own use, and that he was told by

GENOVESE to use it

have !

"for protection."

He said he would still

have the stick if he had not left it in a glove compartment

of a car he sold and does not recall just

went out of fashion.

Italian element in Pittsburgh had a great fear and respect of

LA ROCCA who was, to all intents and purposes, the leader of

of santon a tenures

He recal recall t

when these sticks

recalled that in those days the

the "blackhanders."

He said that LA ROCCA was overshadowed

on many occasions, however, by FRANK AMATO, a more mature and

calm racketeer who gave many orders himself and was far more

respected than was LA ROCCA because of his restraint and thought-

fulness in dealing with men working for him.

He said that working

in the same office AMATO was a direct contrast to LA ROCCA

and tempered LA ROCCA's orders and blusteryness somewhat.

will have to be handled, however, within the next five or

six weeks, and that at

the end of that time LA ROCCA will

probably be called before him to answer some questions

concerning his whereabouts during his disappearance

and for further instructions regarding his petition for

naturalization.

HEIMOVITZ advised that he will immediately

contact the Pittsburgh Office of the FBI should any new

recommendations concerning the petition filed by LA ROCCA

come to his attention and that he will advise SA VEGE
