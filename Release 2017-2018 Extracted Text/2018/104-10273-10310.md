Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

jicasions sinc

Jiad claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there

at last the caily iSoo Pres bron

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his serviies

to the Drug

Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMIXC

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a

long-time record of

falsely claiming Agency affiliation.

the late 1950's HENMING and STURGIS,

both former U.S. Naries,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionnent with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thercafter,

STURGIS organized a

group of mercenaries

for Caribbean and

Central American

activities which he named the International

Anti-Conmunist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this

"Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the

Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan

government expose of this assassination plot

involving HENMING,

you are referred to attachments to instant

memorandum, to wit:

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 Jun•

1975 in the

name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT,

and an extract from a book

published in early 1976 writton by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup d'ciat

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John T. Kennety

is a diatrihe against the Agency and attempts to link the ngency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY.

One of the major

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

GARRISON

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALl, but it is

interesting

so after Gerald Patrick

HEMMING and

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
