Ceferino and JOsefinalplanning to 50 to llew York soon). she has i

trying to get something started here, as reported before. It is

strongly urged that this dosetina be

surveilled

constantly

as 1,

as well as Frank, think that she is affiliated with Castro's eland

activitios here in the States.

She

Cap tain Despain is planning on going

to join t:

U. So Army. He is definitely strongly suspected of giving everythi

of Intelligence to Castro and is tied in with the Conmunist and Car

groups here. He may even soon plan to disappear from the scene and

should not be allowed to get off

easily. He has been keeping Dr.

Jose Julio Fernandez from organizing his

anti-Castro and Anti-Comi

files due to lack of funds (says Despain).

It seems thatthis was

an excuse before and was done to keep the ball functioning as shoul

be. I think that this Dr. Jose. Julio Fernandez is very

sincere a

is innocently giving everything into the hands of Despain without

knowing. How Despain got into this position is not know by us jet.

As far as we are concerned he is a Castro penetration into the Freni

and U.S. activities.
