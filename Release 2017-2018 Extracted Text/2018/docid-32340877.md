CASTRO presented a plan that he wanted approved by the people

He wanted this plan approved because

he intended to present it to a Congress of Cuban Exile Groups

meeting in Santo Domingo the next couple of days. FRANK

JOSE SUAREZ ESQUIVEL from MNC stated that the political

for a meeting. During this meeting it was discussed that no

action should be carried out in the U.S., but JOSE SUAREL

(5)

- On March 9, 1977, DI. RAFAEL RIVAS VASQUEZ,

Deputy-Director DISIP, advised that in Jane, 1976, two

meetings were held in the Dominican Republic

attended by leaders of the principal Cuban exile organizations.

They had two meetings, the first one, and the larger of the

two, was a political meeting to agree on a political strategy

for

The other one, a much

smaller meeting, was strictly operational and was

attended

by 6 people.

Itsspurpose was to decide on terrorist activity

against Cuba. DISIP learned from a source that the following

people attended the operational meeting: ORLANDO BOSCH,

GUILLERMO NOVO, LUIS POSADA, an unidentified representative

of the Brigade 2506, FRANK CASTRO and ARMANDO LOPEZ ESTRADA.

PROPPER volunteered

that one of his sources identified

RObERTO CARBALLO, present Head of the. Brigade 2506, as its

representative at the meeting.

"According to RIVAs, a map

was marked up during the meeting, showing the various

divisions of responsibility. For example, POSADA's group

was assigned all of South America and the Caribbean was a

target of opportunity for all groups. Mr. PROPPER asked

who had been assigned

North America.

RIVAS said he did not

•know, but that he had a copy of the map.. PROPPER asked for

a copy...of the-map-and RIVAS agreed to furnish it.

PROPPER"

explained that he speculated that North America may have

been divided in two by a horizontal line, running across

the U.s. at the level of Washington, D.C. If so, the

territory north of the line may have been assigned to the NOVO

brothers, who worked primarily out of New Jersey (although

one of them, IGNACIO, actually lives in Florida); the Brigade

may

ve been assigned North America south of Washington,

Subsequent to that meeting, said RIVAS, POSADA'S

Cubana) in Barbados (RICARDO and FREDDY LUGO); and,

finally,

the bombing of the Cubana airliner on October

Dr. RIVAS said BOSCH told him that he believes

BOSCH also told RIVAS that the Cuban Exile umbrella organization,

CORU, was responsible for the machinegunning in Rome of

Chilean Christian Democratic leader BERNARDO LEIGHTON.

RIVAS-said that DISIP-believes that CORU was also responsible

for the attempt on the Cuban Consul's life in Merida, as well

as the kidnaping (in conjunction with a right wing Argentine

group called Trinchera)

C. Information Concerning CORU Meeting in the

Jominican Republic in June, 1976, From May

' 13,

1966 Edition of New Times Magazine Article

Entitled, "I Am Going to Declare War" By

BLAKE FLEETWOOD.

FLEETWOOD's article is a result of a four-hour

interview of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, who was at the time of the

interview incarcerated in Caracas, Venezuela, for his role

in the October, 1976, bombing by anti-CASTRO exiles of a

Cubana airliner plane, which cost the lives of some 73

people. The interview contained the following information U

regarding the June, 1976, meeting in the Dominican Republic

by anti-CASTRO Cuban exileste

BOSCH's plotting culminated in a secret meeting of

the top terrorist leaders of the hemisphere in the Dominican

Republic.

"The story of CORU (Coordination of the United

Revolutionary Organizations) is true," he told me. "There

was a meeting in the Bonao mountains

of 20 men representing

all different (Cuban exile) activist organizations. It was a

meeting of all the military and political directors with

revolutionary implications.

It was a great meeting.

Everything was planned there."

The top men from Alpha 66 (New Jersey), Abdalah

(a New York-based youth group), the 2506 Brigade (veterans

of the Bay ôf Pigs invasion), FLNC, F14 (New York City)

and Accion Cubana (a group BOSCH headed) met for two days

in the Bonao mountains in early June, 1976.

They decided

to band together under

umbrella organization, CORt,

with

BOSCH as the only identified spokesman and leader. o

"At last we had all the Cuban revolutionary

fighters and leaders together after 17 years.

We decided

to upscale the action after that. We wanted to beat the

guy (CASTRO) or at least make his life impossible.

I told

them that we couldn't just keep bombing an embassy here and

a police station there.

We had to start taking more serious

actions--hijacking."

(According to a Cuban exile newspaper,

one of the resolutions that came out of that meeting.

"to besin attackins CASTiO's Planes in the air,"› ll

"I accepted the leadership of CORU because

I

wanted

to set everything up on an organized basis. We were tired

on the kind of help they could expect in Nicaragua, the

Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Chile.

Then the group

dispersed.

In the

11 months since that meeting, BOSCH

boasts, CORU has been responsible for over 50 bombings in

Miami,

New York, Venezuela, Panama, Mexico, and Argentina.

(BOSCH refused to admit any personal involvement in bombings

within the United States; police sources say the leaders

had agreed not to take credit for actions within the.U.s

because the FBI was putting too much heat on them.)

POSADA also reported that all of the groups attending,

with the

exception of the CNM, were in favor of confining any

actions against the Cuban Government to areas outside the

U.s.

POSADA also reported that actions against the Cubana

Airlines were discussed

and that as a result, subsequent

actions were taken.

MORALES continued that on the evening of May 9, 1977,

he was talking to FRANK CASTRO, who is now residing in Miami,

Florida. MORALES stated that CASTRO advised him during

the telephone conversation that during the meeting, JOSE DIONISIO

SUAREZ had made the statement that the CNM had one contract with

the Chileans in the U.S., which still

had to be carried out,

and this was the LETELIEP killing.

in analysis of the above information reflects

several obvious factual conflicts. Dr. RIVAS VASQUE!

advised in March, 1977, that one of the DISIP sources

had reported two meetings in the Dominican Republic in

A larger one, which was a political meeting,

and the smaller one, which was strictly operational, whose

purpose was to decide on terrorist activity against Cuba.

Among those present at the operational weene, accordings

to the source, was GUILLERMO NOVO. MM 1337-S, who was

also in attendance at the June, 1976, meeting, advised

that the meetings were held in

the Dominican Republic

on June 11, 12, and 13, 1976, and that the representatives

from the Cuban Nationalist Movement were Dr. JUAN PULIDO

and JOSE DIONISIO SUAREZ, nOt GUILLERMO NOVO. Moreover,

MM 1337-S presented the conference more as one continuous

than as two separate meetings, but did advise that the

conference contained discussions of future terrorist

activities. (8)

BOSCH,

through BLAKE FLEETWOOD, confirmed that

the meeting had

taken place in June of 1976 in the Dominican

Republic and had been

attended by all of the military and

political directors of the different Cuban exile groups.

BOSCH also confirmed through the FLEETWOOD article that

CORU had been formed at that meeting, and that he himself

was the leader. (U)

MORALES in his statements confirmed that the

meeting had taken place and stated that it was only one of

the conu meetings held in June, 1976 further, MORALES

aavising that his information came through DISIP agent Ca

LUIS POSADA, stated that JOSE SUAREZ, not GUILLERMO NOVO,

had been

representative from the Cuban Nationalist

Movement

As can be

seen from the above, several distinct

celerences were made to two meetings in

the Dominican

Republic in June of 1976.

They can either be interpreted

as two meetings at the same three-day conference or as a

continuous

meeting over a period of several days, which

obviously involved more than one physical encounter of

attendees, which would thereby explain the apparent

conflict.

This in fact was the original interpretation

by the 00 as regards to the above point inasmuch-as MM-1337-g

reported the presence of SUAREZ at the June, 1976, meeting

and this was corroborated by another source.

therefore persuaded to believe that in fact ISUAREZ did

attend the meeting, and that the information provided by S

DISIP which indicated that GUILLERMO NOVO had been the

representative at the

meeting, had been simply an error f
