Talking to Hank Schorr today, he passed the follow:
interesting detail on USCA reqnesiss

CCS now holds for HSCA review some 1,850 documents
én individuals.on whom requests were made, plus: anothe?
414 documents on organizations. This cevers about 30
individuals (there was no record in COS on a much large
number of people). .He adds that he could not tell me
hou many files were involved, nor how many pages there
were per document::.

He states that no one from HSA, has come down to lool
at the first document.

He states that CCS is up to date on all requests
received by it, vhich has been reported to Sa/DD0
(now Shepanek)«

ané in what form. nd what does ESCA understahd to
be its responsibility to review material when reported | 4
reaty for review?
