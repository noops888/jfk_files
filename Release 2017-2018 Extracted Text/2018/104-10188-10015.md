LESSING ACTION

MINE FOR BENES

MONITE SPEND

CAN MAN MIS

MICOVER

The LIONION Pulse Camera has been working for well over

3

Wear with no major technical problen.

A few months ago the

100 foot

magazine had to be repaired because the supply spindles had

tightened

and

put an excessive strain on the motor.

More recently, the battery supply had dropped to about

The sensor relay

22.5 volts or

so causing erratie operation because of chattering and

suffered the most

consequently arcing

between the points..

3.

To prevent failures of this type in the future, Raymond l.

BARCENAS is making a small battery charger at a nominal

cost that

can be floated scross the batteries keeping them fully charged.

We are doing it this way

rather than ordering

a DC power supply

because it is less expensive than a commercial model and

will not

be bothered by house current interruptions or fluctuations.

however,

WOACRE/PB foresees any problems by doing it this way, please

inform

US -

4.

On a recent visit to LIONION and a check of the equipment,

it was

found that the

lens of his FOCOMAT IC enlarger has a

fungus

like smudge between the elements.

We cannot detect

any degradation

in print quality

but would like o have a new one in case this is a

fungus and it gets worse.

In summation it is requested that WOACRE/PB provide the

following to Mexico City, charge 7135-2403.

Sensor Relay believed to be a Patter-Bromfield 5A5089
