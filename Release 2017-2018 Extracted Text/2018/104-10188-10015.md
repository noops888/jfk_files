1,  LIOHION 1 photographic results continue to be Satisfactory
for all concerned, It is thereforo advisable that ao changes in

proceduro be made at this time,

2s. It is apparent that LIOCNION 2 releyed the incorrect devel-
_ opang ‘ormula for the pulso camera filp, Perhaps thie error is due to
“bis inactivity im processing such film for over a year. Since the
Conception of this operation all pulse casera film has been developed
in Nicrodol x, the other baad, Tri X film used in the LIONION 2
operation “(Pentax ‘casera and, Balseope) has traditionally been devel-

oped in Acufine.

3. All pulee camera film is processed at Headquarters by an
automatic Huston system. Time and temperature information which the
lab uses would be of little value to your devolopment procedure, - The
results of your recent test indicate that it should be satisfactory
for ap occasional check on tho equipwent.

4. The differonco between Plus X Negative and Plus X Pan film
is worth only ono half "f" stop, which should cause ao babe if you

decide to use the latter,

GAQUAT IC /L TON ION Pulse Camera

TETGH RE GUEEO - REFERENCES

Action: $ce paragraph $5,

1, The LIONION Pulse Camera has been working for well over a
year with no major technical problem, A few months ago the 100 foot
Film magazine had to be repaired because the supply spindles had
tightened and put an excessive strain on the motor,

2. More recently, the battery supply had dropped to about
22.5 volts or so causing erratic operation, The sensor relay between
the VLS-2 and the camera suffered the most because of chattering and
consequently arcing between the points.

3. To prevent failures of this type in the future, Raymond L.
BARCENAS is making a small battery charger at a nominal cost that
can be floated across the batteries keeping them fully charged.

We are doing ft this way rather than ordering a OC power supply
because it is less expensive than a comercial model and will not
be bothered by house current interruptions or Fluctuations. If
however, WOACRE/PB foresees any problems by doing it this way,

inform us.
4. On a recent visit to LIONION and a check of the equipment,
it was found that the lens of his FOCOMAT IC enlarger has a fungus

like smudge between the elements. We cannot detect any degradation
in print quality but would like b have 9 new one in case this is a

fungus and it gets worse.
5. In summation it is requested that WOACRE/PB provide the
following to Mexico City, charge 7135-2403.

please

a. _ Sensor Relay believed to be a Patter-Bromfield 55089

AQUATIC/PBRUMEN/LIONION -~ Transmittal of 35mm Pulse Camera -

‘ACTION BtouN

Reference: MEX1-3960

1. The attachment contains the defective 35mn Pulse Camera
previously reported In referenced cable, Very little acditional
information can be supplied, concerning this mechanical fallure,
other than that reported In the reference. This particular camera
was Installed on 16 June-1965 and operated normally from that date
untll the afternoon of 28 June, at which time It began to continually
blow fuses. Hugh T. FRANCOTTE entered the LIONION Photographic
basehouse that aight, and when It was found that the problem could
not be corrected on the scene, the camera was removed and taken to
MKCHARITY for further troubleshooting. tt was finally discovered
that the shutter motor was malfunctioning and partlally burned-out.
Joseph M. RESCIGNO stated that since there was a definite “short
in the motor, this would cause the camera fuses to constantly blow.

2. Also Included in the attachment are two (2), one hundred
foot capacity, film mayatines, Both of these magazines are Faulty,
causing the film to Jam, They were both In use with the previous
Pulse Camera which became Inoperat ive during late May and was
forwarded to KURIOT Headquarters for repalr. FRANCOTTE had two (2)
new magazines In stock, and they were issued to LIONION/I: for use
with the camera presently teing returned for repair or replacement,

quarters, KURIOT had recently beyun an extensive evaluation of
the Nikon closed circule televisfon system. If this particular
system Is now considered “operational, FRANCOTTE wishes to be
so advised, as there may he a possible application for tt tn
Support of an operation at the Mexico City Station. Lawrence FY
BARKER was recently briefed. by FRANCOTTE on the Nikon system,
and Is now Interested In obtalning additional facts concerning it.
BARKER, who Is responsible for the LIONION Project, foresees a
possibility for its use Im the LIONION photographic basehouse.

the Station could examine the possibility of a permanent! Instal=
lation. Presently, LICNION/] Ts utilizing a Galscope ani Pentax
camera’ for obtaining photographic coverage of the entrante to the
PBRUMEN Embassy. Provided the televislon camera could be equipped
with a telephoto lens of about the same focal length as tne
combination of the Balscopeé and 20X eyepiece, this sys might
be a sultable substitute for the equipment now In servi .
