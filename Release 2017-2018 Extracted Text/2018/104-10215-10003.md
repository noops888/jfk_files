: Je nile at Headquarters in the early part of May 1957, it wae verbally
sgreed that I return to Cuba for about one year, security permitting,

2, While ry operational work in Cuba from August 195) until February
1957 was concentrated on commnist targets in the University of Habana, 4t
should te pointed out that ny dities during that Period also involved many
contacts with sutversive op-ositionist elements. Yhen governrental persecution
increased during February 1957, two of my key agents were lost, one of them
by governmental asszssination, so that Iwas obliged to leave Cuba temporarily
pending clarification of tie security factors involved. During my three
months atsence in PEPRIME the local situation deteriorated; and after my

i had lost assets tut nad retained the cumlative security hazards of three years

H of cultivation and recruitment efforts. The University was, and still is,
Penetration efforts are continuously harrassed by

d official persecutien of the target group,

3. Since by June 1958 I shall have spent four years in Cuba, I believe
it appropriate to submit this letter at this time requesting that Headquarters
begin to study the ocssibilities for reassignnent abeat June 1958, or prior
to that date if necessary. As to future assignments, I have ne reservations
or special recuests, I an willing and xepared to travel to any area
consistent with my cualifications. Generally speaking, and for otvious

_ + security reasons, I an interested in getting out of the Central Amer:
Cerittean area if rossible. It may be recalled that I was denied an

visa in 1953, for purely technical reasons. may be c
