b. Prior to his. arrival at the training site Iden F reecived

emergency procedures, which included. 4 hours of autorotation.

e, The language harrier between student and instructor retarded
the student's progress to some extent, His navigation, flight plan=
ning and weight and halance work is limited, It, is recommended that’
he have.aceess to a helicopter each day in order to bitildup his time.

d. The student was willing, cooperative and intelligent.

a. Iden G's training schedule Included much of the same material
as that of Iden F except that his personnel rappelling, parachuting
and sling work amounted to 1435 hours. His cross-country time aw
mounted to approximately 1450 hours.

- SHERS a

as : “UAPA-0101

a. Iden B received training which: exposed him to all aspects
of Bell 47G3B1 helicopter flight and support requirements.

b. The flight familiarization ineluded alwest<all of the
normal helicopter mancuvers along with radio procedures. His
total flight -time amounted to-5+30 hours. Both instructor pilots
noted that his flying procedures were rough, but were improving,
steadily. He did not solo inasmuch 8 both pilots indicated that
he was not.reddy for solo. r

e. Iden B wash given approximately 9 hours orientation in
helicopter maintenance and from 3-4. hours of orientation with ré~
gard to the contents ofthe, support kits and accessory equipment.

1) Flying preficiency in 476381 is below par at this time.
He requires more dual and emergency procedures. - :

2) His conversation and experience indicates that he ii
more knowledgeable of Hughes equipricht than he is of Bell
equipment. i :

3) Iden B appears to be a very extroverted type of ine
dividual. In any conversation tie Uoes most of the talking.

4} The. instructor pilots felt that his Knowledge of hel-
icopters leaned to the "manual" side rather than the. practical
side. We scemed, according to the instructor pilot, to have
a "shallow" knowledge of helicopter opeéations.
