4k, Sf¥orts to debrief A~7 on
sonewhat futile in this initial ne:

ng in view of his unsettled emotion
His primary concern appeared to be his wite his ether str:
ship with his in-laws, who were now residing in Iami. this con-
nection, it should be pointed out that this euctional state appeared to sten,

in part, from his inherent suspicions that his wife (21 years of age end rel-
atively attractive) vas being unfaithful to him. All indications are, however,
thet A-7 has no real basis for these suspicions; other than those conjured up

in his om mind. In any case, he requested if it might not be possible to wire~
tap his wife's house in Miemi, so thet he could have daily reports on her activi-
ties, while no promises were made, A-7 wes assured we would attempt to look
into this possibility, once we had more definite information tHat there ver
sone grounds for his suspicions. (Note: Subsequent discussions vith Sect
ce revealed thet a wire-tap of A-7's house was a major project ii
end impossible to eccowplish at this time without tieing up considerable
personel.) A-7 was later told this after we assured him that his suspicions
were groundless wheré ais wife. was concerned.

5. Following this initial meeting with 4-7, it vas apparent to both
ctr. Pekich ard the undersigned that tine ‘would be needed to restore agent's
confidence in our capability to support his efforts in any future projected
assignment in the field. Moreover, A-7's emotionel state, which appears to
stem from his problems with nis in-laws and his concern about leaving his wife
alone, must be fully resolved before attempting to dispatch him egain.

6. I later debriefing session held trom 8 to 15 November with A-7,
eonsiderable more light was thrown on the nature and seove of his operational
activities in Cuba, As previously indicated in paregraph 1 of this report,
A-7's activities are suimarized es follows:

iernal Assets Developed in Cuba for future Cpereticasl Use:

In attempting to sift out specific assets developed by 4-7 during
his activities in Havana, three of the more prominent individuels with
whom A-7 wes in direct contact should be listed.

c. Problems Sncountered by A-7 while Oserating in Cub

Some of the more significant problems. encountered by A-7
during the course of his operations in Havena ere as follow:

(2) See In this connection, A-7 Stated that despite

the disguise given him, he had to be constantly on the alert
from the danger of being picked up by G-2 or Castro police
during the course of his numerous operational contacts. He
sited several examples vhere he believed he was under sur-
veillance by the opposition end subsequently succeeded in allud-
ing this surveillence. He complained thet disguise, (hair-
piece and mustache) rapidly deteriorated in the Havana climate
end as a consequence he was forced to abandon this disguise tower
the latter vart of his stay in Havena. Similarly, te was forced
to chenge his quarters continually, by moving from one safehouse
to enother as a security precaution, since he felt that it vas
generally known in Cuban circles that he was operating in the
Hevana area, and that he was probably already under the sur-
veillance of Castro security forces.

(2) Heteriel Support: In the course of these debriefing
sessions, one of A-7's chief complaints vas thet despite nis
urgent messages sent through his cut-out (AMERESZ) to the Ste:
that arms and other militery equipment werd sorely needed by!
nis groups in Havana end Finer del Rio, no ection vas taken to
implement his requests. As a result, A-7 felt he vas Losi:
with his followers end this wes one of the primary actors
returning to the States to discuss this aspect vith Heedquarters.

(3) Heed for Direct Commmication: A-7 sted that without th
services of 2 operator who could be in direct commmication
with us, he is fully convinced thet any subsequent return t

in an operational capacity would be inef:
would be one of the conditd

8. Case Officer Comments: Despite A~7's tendencies to overate on
& grandiose stele, His disappointment in the leck of support received on nis
initiel mission to Cuba; and bis disvley of emotional instability at times,
it is believed that his efforts can ve properly chenneled to wor: effectively
for us in Cuba. His motivation appears to stem from his personal ambitions
to make his mark on this counter-revolution against Castro, where he can |
assure himself of a priminent position in the future government to be formed
in Cuba after the overthrow of the Castro regime. A-7 has imagination and
the will to succeed. His weakness is his inability to hide his personal
embitions fron others who may work with him and who may have altogether dif-
ferent motivations end sense of values. Hence, it is believed thet A-7
will encounter problems in handling pedle recruited or assigned to hin in
the course of his activities inside the cowtry, AMPUG-1 can ve sited as
a good exemple, there a clash of personalities hes apparently clready taken
place. In view of this, A-7 will have to be dealt with firmly ond mst te
convinced thet the success or failure of his projected mission will Gepend
on his ability to develop confidence and loyalty among his followers once ht
is inside the covntry egain. Similarly, A-7 mst resolve his personal problem
dealing with bis wife and in-laws, which has had an edverse effect on him
personally since his return, and may affect his operations inside Cube. The
next several veeks will, therefore, need be devoted to re-establish A
confidence in our ability to support his efforts in Cuba, once he is sent
pack, and working out his family problems to obviate any adverse psyczolo-
gical effect which may be detrinental to his operations im Cuba.
