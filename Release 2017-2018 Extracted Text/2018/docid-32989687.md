PURPOSE:

To recommend that Legal Counsel Division consult
with the Department to seek guidance as to the manner in
which the Bureau should respond to HSC requests for materials

in Bureau files relating to organizations and individuals \
currently involved in civil litigation with the Bureau, and a ee
to ascertain how Bureau personnel should respond to similar A
inquiries while giving testimony in either Executive or Ry
public sessions,

q ‘a
DETAILS: (ie

In September and October, 1975, the HSC requested
among other items, information from Bureau files concernin:
a number of individuals associated with the Socialist Workers
Party (SWP) and information from the file on the Institu
for Policy Studies (IPS), as well as the file of former
Bureau informant Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

On 11/5/75, Bureau representatives Mr. W. R. Wannall,
Mr. R. L. Shackelford, and Mr, D. Ryan furnished depositions
to the HSC concerning numerous matters including Bureau
investigations of 5 individuals affiliated with the SWP
and this Bureau's investigation of the IPS, HSC representatives
indicated at that time, that these topics will be the sub-
ject of testimony scheduled for public session 11/18/75,
With regard to HSC inquiries concerning the 5 SWP individuals,
the thrust of the inquiries centered around this Bureau's
authority to investigate the SWP and its members, which is
one of the main issues to be resolved in a pending civil
suit which the SWP has brought: against the Bureau, With

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: U. S. House Select Committee On Intelligence (HSC)

Earl Robert Merritt, Jr., a former Bureau informant who
furnished information concerning the IPS. Charges by
Merritt have been publicly refuted by this Bureau. It
is noted that the IPS is also currently involved in
civil litigation with this Bureau charging illegal
wiretapping and breaking and entering.

Additionally, on 11/5/75, 2 Bureau Agents,
against whom Merritt has levied his unfounded charges, were
deposed by HSC members at which time the Agents were
accompanied by the Departmental Attorney who is handling

_ this litigation.

OBSERVATIONS:

In view of the pending HSC réquest for material
relating to IPS, as well as information pertaining to
Earl Robert Merritt, Jr., who is to be a principal witness
in the IPS civil litigation, and because the HSC
representatives have indicated that the questioning of
Bureau officials scheduled for the HSC public hearing on
11/18/75 will involve matters directly related to the
Government's actions in the defense of the civil suits
regarding both the IPS and SWP, it is felt that Departmental
*advice should be sought prior to this Bureau responding :
to or engaging in further response to the HSC in these areas.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1) That Legal Counsel Division consult with the
Department to obtain advice as to how the Bureau should
respond to HSC requests for materials concerning IPS and
Merritt, and advise the Intelligence Division by memorandum
of the results.

2) Legal Counsel Division should determine from
the Department, the parameters to which Bureau representatives
should confine their testimony in either Executive or eee
sessions concerning IPS and SWP and advise the heh a
Division by memorandum. I / ples

Re: Houstudy

in accordance with the rules of the Committee nothing would be pub-
licized without the knowledge of the FBL Later in the meeting the
question of classification arose again and the HSC staff members
indicated confusion and an inability to specifically outline the
classification procedure,

The questioning opened with Mr. Wannall being asked if
he had knowledge of any electronic surveillance coverage of Congress-
men, It was subsequently determined the HSC staff had specific
reference to our microphone coverage of a hotel room in New York City
in the 1960's wherein Congressman Cooley, who was associated with
a sugar lobby, was monitored, It also became apparent the question
was based upon information recently furnished to the Committee by
former Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan, Thereafter a
wide range of responsibilities, activities and operations of the INTD
were discussed in what can only be described as a "shotgun'' manner.
Some of the topics discussed, which the Committee staff members
indicated would probably be discussed again in public were: security
index; informant procedures; electronic surveillance matters and
approval procedures; jurisdiction; surreptitious entries; Cointelpro
history, philosophy and techniques; the Socialist Workers Party (SWP);
the Vietnam Veterans Against the War; the institute for Policy Studies
(IPS) investigation; trash covers; former informant Robert Merritt, Jr.;
number of arrests of "Soviet illegal agents" and U. S,' citizens en-
gaged in espionage; persona non grata matters; retention of FBI
records policy; etc. Specifically, it was indicated the following
individuals who have been affiliated with the SWP and about whom
there are allegations of improper investigation would be discussed
at public hearings: Kathye Zahrie, Norma Lodico, Bruce Bloy, Mark
Rich, Matilde Zimmerman. Although it was pointed out to the HSC

On November 4, 1975, Inspector Thoma Leavitt and I
briefed Emily Sheketoff of the House Select Committee on

Intelligence with respect to our counterintelligence sar BR

sibilities, At the close of the briefing, Emily Sheketoff
asked if she could be furnished with data concerning infiltration
of Congressional staffs,

On November 5, 1975, Emily Sheketoff called, at which
time I referred her to a letter directed to Mr. Kelley dated
October 22, 1975, from Mr, Aaron B. Donner, Counsel to the
Select Committee, I noted that Mr. Donner specifically would
like to know the extent with which “Russian spies have
infiltrated our country and Capitol Hill as well," I told
Emily Sheketoff that we were responding to this letter and our
answer would cover the question raised by herself. She said .
this was not so, and she wanted specific information from th 2
Bureau on those staff members on Capitol Hill who were givin
out information to hostile services, She noted that Mr. Donner's
letter was limited to Russian spies and she stated that she was
interested in any hostile elements - East German, Polish, or others,

I requested Emily Sheketoff to go to her Chairman
and have the Chairman forward the request to the Bureau in
writing, She said she would do this and would have the letter
in my hands today, I asked that she have the letter forwarded
through regular established channels. She noted that this would
involve sending the letter to Mr, Michael E, Shaheen, Jr., in the
Justice Department and this always meant delay, In this case
she stated that she needed the answer certainly by the close of
business on November 7, I told Emily Sheketoff that I could not
make any sajeminatiesibantic put certainly we would put forth our best efforts. |

that in convection with a DOD briefing of th&_House Select N

in clandestine operations in the U. S. in concert with the FBI.

{

As a result, Army was now compiling material whi
vided to the HSC.

Following consultation with SAW. 0. Cregar, it was
concluded that the proposed Army submission to HSC cold be

made available if the target services in each instance were
identif as “communist intelligence services" throughout,

thus providing additional protection to our bilateral operations

Since the material furnished indicated that a similar
request had been directed to Navy and Air Force and the suspense
date was 10/15/75, inquiry vas made of Charles Torpy, OSTHQ,
and Jack Donnelley, HISHQ, es to the status of requests from
those agencies, Noither individeel vas aware of the situation
but both subséqueutly advised thet their services had concluded

According to this source, KATHY (LNU) and BABAK
ZAHRAIE plan to be married soon. They are compatible, and

7 7 The "UW Daily," a student newspaper published in
Seattle, Washington, on January 13, 1972, page one, carried
an article by GAIL FLIGSTEIN entitled, "Abortions: in Hall
Health? UW Hospital Prices Too High, says New Group."
KATHLEEN SLEDGE, one of the founders of the campus abortion
reform group, was quoted as stating, “Hopefully we can raise
people's consciousness so they can realize an abortion is very
minor surgery." The group was to hold its first meeting on
January 13, 1972. In part, according to SLEDGE, the UW Hall
Health Center could perform abortions on students free or |
cheaply, whereas the University Hospital charged $300, which i
was beyond the average student's limits. She did not fore-
see any political conflicts within the new group.

As of February, 1972, KATHLEEN SLEDGE, 816 Northeast
53rd Street, Seattle, was a member of the YSA.

charges 'political' move to deport him." According to the
article, BABAK ZAHRAIE, President, UW Foreign Student Council,
yesterday charged that the United States Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) was attempting to deport him
to silence him politically. ZAHRAIE, who was attending UW
on a student visa, was arrested by INS,Tuesday and escorted
to a hearing concerning his re-entry into the United States
on a student visa from Canada. According to ZAHRAIE, he came
to the UW in 1969 and is currently a junior student in Mathe-
matics married to the former KATHLEEN SLEDGE of Spokane.

A review was made of the original informant report *.'
indicating that KATHY ZAHRAIE or KATHY SLEDGE as of February, <
1972, was a member of the YSA. :

This reflects an informant report py(SE_1134-§ Jdated
February 25, 1972, and captioned "List of Members 6 é Young
Socialists Alliance and Socialists Yorkers Party". This con-
tained about 60 names, apparently believed byf{SE_1134-S)to be
members of the above organizations (see page 35 parapraph 2 of
referenced Seattle report - data from SE T-1).

On the above list was the name KATHY SLEDGE, address of

A preview also of informant's reports of(SE 1590-s )
(shown as SE T~2 on referenced Seattle report, page 4) re-
flects this informant's information was set forth correctly.
It is noted this informant submitted a list of persons he
knew to be members of the YSA and SWP as of June 19, 1972
and the name of KATHY, the employee, was not on the above
list.

When contacted specifically concerning this matter
on September 29, 1972,(SE_1590=S) furnished the data set
forth in referenced Seattle report on page 4, attributed
to him SE T-2.

In view of the above, it was decided Seattle
need not submit a supplemental report. :

Seattle also discussed the data mentioned in
paragraph 5, page 2 of Buairtel pertaining to a leaflet
entitled "Committee To Defend Babak Zahraie". It was
not felt the data therein was particularly significant
and therefore, UACB it is not being submitted as an
exhibit to a supplemental report, No further action
is being taken by Seattle in #A8EH2%: case,

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION

On Standard Form 85, employee indicated that she was
married to BABAK ZAHRAIE, born March 26, 1950, in Tehran, Iran,
and married on September 17, 1972, in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

Information is set forth elsewhere in this investigation
identifying SIAMAK ZAHRAIE a brother of BABAK ZAHRAIE.

ACTIVITIES OF SIAMAK ZAHRAIE

During the period from July 6, 1970 through September 14,
1971, a source provided information regarding SIAMAK ZAHRAIE as
follows:

SIAMAK ZAHRAIE attended five Young Socialist Alliance-
Socialist Workers Party (YSA-SWP) meetings in San Francisco and
Berkeley, California, between July, 1970, and October, 1970,

A characterization of the YSA-SWP is attached
hereto as an appendix to this report.

During January, 1971, SIAMAK ZAHRAIE attended a YSA-SWP
educational meeting at the Students Union at the Modesto Junior
College, Modesto, California and a YSA-SWP iti in Oakland,
California,



SC 140-429

puring early 1971, SIAMAK ZAHRAIE attended a regional
meeting of the YSA at Sacramento State College, Sacramento,
California and a regional meeting of the YSA-SWP at Modesto,
California.

In April, 1971, SIAMAK ZAHRAIE was described as a member
of_the Persian Students Union, reportedly made up mostly of
Middle Bast Asians, who have goals similar to other Communist-
oriented groups. He openly referred to himself as a “Trotskyist”
and was of the opinion the U.S. Government "must go",

During the late spring or early summer of 1971, SIAMAK
t ZAHRAIE and his brother, BABAK ZAHRAIE, and other Iranians,
discussed plans to establish a New Persian Students organization
in the United States, with an alleged purpose of establishing a
revolutionary base in Iran and installing a socialist Government.
The existing Persian students organization was at that time con-~
: sidered ineffective by SIAMAK and BABAK ZAHRAIE.
% : BABAK ZAHRAIE previously had indicated a determination to substitut
Communism for the present form of Government in Iran. SIAMAK ZAHRA
shares this same ideology.

According to surce in 1971, SIAMAK ZAHRAIE, had frequentl
stated his desire to personally kill all of the present members of
the ruling. Zamily of Iran and their administration.

aid remain on for a few weeks to handle leftover matters for
the Department.

‘Dr. KEYES advised: that the employee’ was very inter-
ested in marine mammals and was very conscientious and capable
in her work. He knew her only on the job but found her to be
a bright, forthright and intelligent girl. He never met her
husband or knew anything concerning her personal life, but
his impression of her was favorable and he recommended. °

On 6/5/74, Miss MARILYN WILSON, 8333 57th Street
S. E., Mercer Island, Washington, telephone No. 232-3520,
and employed as a Employment Counselor, Lake Forest Park,
Seattle, advised that she met the employee about'1970 at the
UW. and they have been good friends since 1972. —

Miss WILSON advised that she is taking care of the

Miss WILSON advised that employee is extremely
interested in the study of animals and is very excited and
happy about her present position. She recommended the em-
ployee highly for Government employment.

On 6/6/74, Mr. NORMAN W. ZIRBEL, Vice President
of Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company, Room 1912,
Exchange Building, Seattle, advised he and his wife have
been good friends of Dr. J. N. SLEDGE and his wife, the
parents of the employee who reside in Spokane, Washington.

They became acquainted in 1952 and have been very
close friends since that time.

He said KATHY was an extremely bright student in
high school, graduating with honors and being among the Top
Ten students in her class scholastically. He said she was
very_athletic and is a very pleasant and industrious girl.
He has not seen her very much since she came to the UW in
1969 but has the impression that due to her idealistic
nature, KATHY became sympathetic toward the underprivileged
and later this led her into marrying one BABAK ZAHRAIE,
whom he believes she married out of sympathy and to prevent
BABAK from being deported to Iran. He said his knowledge
concerning this, however, was obtained from KATHY's parents.

He also heard she planned to. divorce--BABAK but
has been held up in securing the divorce because she could
not locate him to serve divorce papers. Mr. ZIRBEL advised
he and his wife have read in the newspaper that BABAK ZAHRAIE
was accused of engaging in political activities against his
native country and also that he was charged with being sub-
versive by the U. S. Immigration & Naturalization Service
(INS). He has no personal knowledge concerning the above.
He’ advised. that KATHY had excellent home training, was a
talented pianist and was reportedly voted the most papular
girl in high school in Spokane, Washington, the year she
graduated. HA

After coming to Seattle, she ‘was a member of
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority at the UW and resided at the
sorority house during her first two years in Seattle.

Mr. ZIRBEL said he felt KATHY is a person of good

On 6/3/74, SE B10 who : eeiestiesdtasttasttt
has been closely acauainted with the enplovee for several
years, advised that the emplovee was an outstanding and
quite normal student at Lewis and Clark High School -in
Spokane, Washington. Fer prade point averarse was approx-
imately 3.8 of a possible 4.0. She was.a cheerleader and
what might be descr. das “all American" girl.

After graduation, the employee enrolled at the
University of Washington at Seattle, Washington, and,
according to this source, "Her troubles hegfan."” Source
described the employee as being somewhat lost among the

her comparatively sheltered and affluent circumstances in
Spokane,-Washington. Source said employee -became associated
with some yranian group and commenced to read the teachings
of MARY and LENIN, She commenced to espouse subjects such
as women's liberation, ete. She voiced opinions very radical
to her normal upbringing, while visiting her family and
acquaintances in Spokane. She commenced to.date one of the
Iranian students named RABAK ZANRAIE, and they had a rela-
tionship of sorts, planning to be married one moment and
then calling it off at the next. It was thought by source

at one time that the empleyee an : a broken off completely.
Shortly thereafter, in 1°71 she marvicd ZARRALE and it sub-

Furthur, regarding the Iranian that the employee
married, the source advised at he reportedly hes been out of the
country since he and employee got married, but source did
not know where he went. She was unable to contact him for
quite awhile. He promised to give her a divorce if she
would pay all the costs.

Since employee and ZAHRAIT have separated, the employee

apparently has changed a preat deal in her thinking. Source
said she found a joh at the Veterans Administration Fospital
in Seattle, which she likes very much. It is not a very
important job, but she is fairly content.

: At present, said source, the employee is living
in a house on Mercer Island in the Seattle area that is
owned by-a professor for whom she had worked at the. University
of Washington, The professor is on some kind of trip and is
letting employee and another ¢ stay there. However, said
source, the employee's living arrangements at present are
somewhat strange in that she has some kind of an arrangement
with a man named PRED LOVGREN who was driving a
taxicab and hoping to re~enroll in college. Source said
LOVGREN has been to the University of Chicago for a couple
of years, but he did not know much further about LOVGREN.
Apparently, said source, the employee lives withZOVGREN
from time to ti but the source’ was not certain as to
what the exact living arrangement is.

This source advised that he has not the slightest
doubt as to the employee's loyalty toward the United States.
Ker upbringing and general circumstances have been very
comfortable, up until the time she started to collere. She
has always shown signs of preferring the hetter i
life, and has never shown any indication of opposition to
the Gapitalist forn of Govern t, such as that recognized
and enjoyed in the United States; hovever, she did express
from time to time completely different views, particularly
during her assec:.ation with and short marriage to BABAK
ZAHRAIL. Source said he does not believe the emplovee vould

indians fight for fishing rights .

By KATHY SLEDGE

TACOMA, Wash. — The Washington game and
fisheries departments are on trial here for robbing
14 Indian
eral government has filed suit on behalf of the
Indians, who are fighting to regain the right to
fish outside their reservations.

‘The Indians! struggle dates back to 1854, when
the Medicine Creck Treaty was signed, taking away
the Indians’ land on Puget Sound. The treaty
did grant the tribes continued fishing tights in
their "usual and accustomed places,” however,
whether on or off the reservations.

Despite a 1968 Supreme Court decision uphold-
ing the off-reservation fishing rights, the state of

ish-in' in Washingion, 1968. Indian struggle con-
tinves for right to livelihood. .

Washington says the Indians can fish only on
their reservations and then only for a limited
amdinnt of fish, "so as not to deplete the resources.”

‘The state game department has placed a blanket
ban on the netting of steelhead (a type of trout)
and other fish by the Indians, declaring the steel-
head gare fish only: Some 100 Indians currently
face trial for fishing off the reservations, and the
arrests continue as the trial here goes on.

State officials have continually charged that the
tribes do not know how to regulate thelr off-res-
ervation fishing and thus threaten the conserva-
tion of steelhead and salmon.

At the trial, however, biologist and fisheries ex-

pert Dr. James Heckman testified to the contrary.
‘The Indians "know much more about the fish
and fishing than many of us learn in college,”
he said, According to Heckman's figures, the In-
dians take only 5 to 6 percent of the total catch
in the area, the rest going to sports fishing and
commercial catches.

‘Over the past 50 years the annual salmon catch

‘ibes of their fishing rights. The fed-.

has dropped from 16 million pounds te three
million. The Indians have pointed out that con-
struction, the removal of gravel from spawning
grounds, flooding, and agricultural and industrial
pollution have depleted the fish runs—not the tiny
amount of tribal fishing.

‘The state places conservation of profits above
conservation of fish, the Indians argue. They point
out that "the state owes its loyalty to the com-
mercial fishermen and to the sportsmen,” not the
Indians. .

‘The tribes depend on fishing for am important

part of their livelihood. Bach tribe has its own
conservation practices, and it would be self-de-
feating for ‘them to knowingly damage the fish
runs.
“Although the fevetal government hes filed the
Suit on Behalf of the 14 tribes, the Indians view
the aims of the government with distrust, At the
trial, this reporter spoke with one Indian who
said that individual tribe members are not at all
satisited with the way the federal government is
representing them.

‘A member of the Yakima tribe said: "Many other
tribes wanted to pull out. But we decided that ff
we want to go through with the suit and pour
into the case every bit of fact, research, biology,
history, and anthropology we can’ and use the
courtroom as a tract to get the record straight.
It also helps to inform the public of our struggle.

"HE we don't win at this level,"“he continued,
‘we will have under us a solid end -ompicie legal
basis for further reviews once it reaches the Ninth
Cirenit Court.”

The Indians believe that the state fisherias de-
patient and the ieaeral government are very ji
close to each othe: in the case. "They could prac- }}
tically sit down and agree on this case between
themselves right now,” said Fred Lane, tribal co-
ordinator.

Lane also pointed out that "the state has cailed
to recognize the fac that the treaty rights of In-

Washington state ontrial = - Sie |
f

dians never belonged to the state in the first place.
‘They were original rights held by the Indians
before there was a state and reserved for them-
selves in an honored agreement with the federal
government while Washington was still a territory.”

Furthermore, the federal government has ailowed
the state to develop two completely different cases.
The fisheries department argues that it does rec-
ognize treaty rights, and simply asks the court
to determine the scope of those rights so it can
regulate them. The game department, on the other
hand, says the Indians have no treaty cights, ||
and refuses to concede that it should allow any
tribal fishing at all,

Despite these obstacles, the Indians say they
are determined to "fight ‘as our ancestors have
for over 100 years ‘or our rights, as the original
inhabitants of th:s land, to fish and sustain our-
selves.”

| SEATTLE—David Hathaway, 24,
was the roommate of Frank Teruggi,

an American graduate student who

was found riddled with bullets in the

'] Santiago morgue early this me 3th.

4 He was among those murdered by

ists."

On Oct. 9, Hathaway told The Mili-
tant what happened to him and his
roommate in the wake of the military

Frank Teruggi, stain U.S. student

oe On Sept. 20, just 15 minutes
9 after the 8 p.m. curfew, Frank and
8 Dave were silting ct home when po-
lice entered, looking for foreigners.
4 Hathaway said the “antiforeigner
q hysteria” was whipped up by the junta
4"to use foreigners in Chile as scape
4 Seats. They tried to blame all Chile's
2 problems on these 14,000 ‘foreign
4 guerrillas" who had come into Chile
¥.under Allende to ‘provoke violence

Student victim of

o

and civil war,' to ‘kill Chileans,’ and

-to take jobs away.”

‘ Phe police ransacked their house
but could only find a few Marxist
books and magazines, mostly in
Frank's room. Frank was a student
of economics at the University of
Chile, and Dave was at that timework-
ing as a lathe operator in a Santiago
factory after completing studies in so-
ciology. 7 -

After spending a night in jail, the
two were taken to the national stadium
and placed in a cell with otber for-
eigners. About six hours later. Prank
Teruggi was called out of the cell
by the guards. He was not seen alive
again. _

" Dave was informed of his death
by the U.S. consulate and was ken
to the morgue iv ideniify ihe body.
It was so riddled with bullets, however,
that Hathaway could not identify it.
The body was finally identified as

that of Teruggi by the fingerprints

and a dental plate.

"It's hard to say why Frank was
killed,” said Hathaway. "Many for-
eigners suspected of being ‘extremists’
were beaten, but this brutal treatment
was very arbitrary.

"One night they brought four or
five Chileans into the corridor right
in front of the two cells of foreigners
and beat them violently with gun butts
and clubs for two or three hours.
I don't kuow why they did #, know-
ing thet we would probably. go out
and tell about what they were doing.

"In fact, among the foreigners in
my cell, there was an agreement, an
understanding, that this story had to
be told to everyone, and that when
we got out we would take the truth

out to each of our countries about |

the terrible conditions in Chile."

Hathaway estimated there were
about 7,000 people in the stadium,
It was overcrowded. People had +;
either sleep overlapping each of!
or take turns, sleeping in four-ho

‘shifts. The first two days he was there

no food was given to the prisoners
on the third day, they got only some
bread and coffee.

When asked how he was released,
Hathaway emphasized the important
role of international pressure, especial-
ly from the United States. He felt thar
nohing lottere, and other forme ~f p-->
sure from the U.S. had forced the U.S.
embassy to make a deal with the mili-
tary.

"They agreed to release us [the Amer-
ican prisoners} if the embassy guar-

 anteed that-we would be out ot the

country in two to three days. I was
given 72 hours to leave Chile.”

SELECT COMMITIN:.
ACTIVITIES

On Oeteber 15, 1975, Special Agent Paul V. Daly of this
Bureau in a discussion with Staff “ember Richard Vermeire of cap-
tioned Committee raised the question of the prorer selection of
Bureau witnesses to appear before captioned Comittee citing, in
part, the problems which arose out of the appearance on October 9,
1978, ef Unit Chief James ©. Kraus. It was explained to Verneire
that the methed of selection by the House Select Covmittee was such
that the Committee was not obtaining the best possible witnesses and
that in most instances it would be beneficial for beth the Committee
and the Bureau for the Bureau to ive an input into the witness
selection procesa. It was indicated to Verrmeixce that the Burean
wpen learning of the tepic that was the subject of a hearing could
suggest the witnese that would be the rest knowledgeable concerning
that particular matter and, more importantly, be in a position to
address rolicy questions which might arise during ea hearing.

Vermeire stated that, generally, in the future he ine"
tended to consult the Yureav prier to requesting a payticejar
witness so that the Committee wight avoid proeklems sueh as- those
that were posed during the testimony of Umit Chiei James ¢. Eraus.
He stated that he could not make a coumitment for the Committee
that the Bureau would have an input into the witmes# selection
process; however, he stated that hoth he and Tinothy' Oliphant,

\s Staff Member of the House Select Committee, felt strongly ‘that
Ws \,
\

their procedures concerning witness aclection had to be changed

Memorandum to Mr, W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

The O & C material is, of course, closely held
and it will be necessary initially for Mr, Mallet to meet
with HSC Staff for the handling of the 0 & C material,
inasmuch as he is most familiar with the necessary process,
However, in view of Mr, Mallet's other current responsibilities,
a representative of the Intelligence Division will be phased
into this process as soon as possible,

Richard Vermiere, HSC Staff Member, informed
Supervisor Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel Division, 10/21/75, :
that he would like to begin review of 0 & C material 10/23/75.
However, on 10/22/75, he told Mr. Daly that he would be out
of town on 10/23 and 10/24/75 and would therefore contact
us thereafter to make arrangements for review of this material.

ACTION:

With your approval, we will proceed as indicated
above to grant limited access by HSC Staff to 0 & C material.

Dear Mr. Kelley: Ms

within Berkeley. I would like to follow up that reply with an additional
inquiry into some of the policy matters which underpin that response.

1. I was frankly surprised to note the size of the contingent of Agents op-
erating from the Berkeley Field Office (19), and would appreciate knowing
how this compares to other cities of 100,000 population? In addition,
how does this compare to other cities of 100,000 population which are
located within a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area of the size of s
the San Francisco-Oakland SMSA and which have other major offices (in
this instance offices are located in San Francisco and Oakland at least)?

.2, What are the Bureau's policies regarding "affirmative action" or assignment
to areas with substantial minority communities? Berkeley has a Black
population of some 25% and a population of other minorities around 10%, ‘
yet the Field Office is 100% white/male. Is this a situation which the =

reBureau tries to avoid, or is it not a consideration? +c

\ Bu
= What percentage of the Offices time is devoted to those categories of : +
activity which are labeled as "domestic-intelligence and pipe 14 mae ave

What plans are there for deploying SWAT teams Ua len Lp Hf To hak extent -
are Agents subordinate to or restrained by the Berkeley Police Department

in utilizing SWAT;rteams?, Would the Bureau refrain from SWAT type deployment

at the request of the local jurisdiction? These questions are of particular 8 =
concern to me in. light of the decision, and appropriate one I believe, of OF

Chief Agent Bates to avoid the ‘Bs. of Such force in apprehending, the remnants
of the so-called Symbionese Rs ‘tion Army. i

15. Has the Bureau utilized so-called "black bag" operations in carrying
out its mission in Berkeley? If so, how many type operations were
carried out? When were they carried out, and if they have been term-
inated, when were they so terminated?

T thank you for your consideration of this further inquiry and look forward
to your repily.

ae This is in responsevtoe your letter to me dated
September 29, 1975, which was received on October 7, 1975.

To clarify your inquiries, it should be noted the
‘Resident Agency at Berkeley, California, operates under the
general supervision of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
San Tranciseco Office.

The coxplement of Special Agents assigned te the
EBorkeley Resident Agency is consistent with need in that
poxtion of the territory for which our San Franeisco Field
Office is responsible. The assignment of personnel to the
Berkeley Resident Apency is in proportion to that of arsas
of sinilar size and of like metronolitan composition.

The FBI applies a pesitive program aimed at cir~
culating opportunities in the FBI for members of minority
groups and attracting those who are interested and qualified.
Our positive program, which receives guidance through the
Bureau's Office of Equal Ervployment Opportunity Affairs at
our Ueadquarters in Washington, D. C., is applied by the
Special Agents in Charme of our 59 field offices and their
staffs. While we do not have any minority or female Special
Agents heedquarteroed in Berkeley, we do have Special Agents
of various minorities, including Blacks, Hispanies and
Orientals, and female Special Agents assigned to our
i San Francisco Office and they are available for assignment
wherever the need may arise including in Berkeley,

Honorable Ronald V. Dellums

Based on a survey during March, 1975, the San Francisco
Offlce was devoting wder 20 percent of Lts time to domestic
intelligence (internal security) matters. This survey did
net breal: dowa tho allocation of manpower below the field
office level,

The Special Agent in Charge of every FBI field
office is responsible for the use of the manpower in his
offica, He has the authority to deploy specially trained
pexsomel as necessary. Gur Apprehension Teawa, which have
as theix objectives the enforcoment ef Lays within our juric-
diction and the protection of lives, ray be used in FBI
cases in which tho risk of danger to hunaa life is greater
than novael. Whon we have jurisdiction the decision of how
best to respond is ours alone. We do not anticipate any
conflict with state or Local Law enforcement agencies in
this resard.

By "black bag" operations I assume you wean sur-
reptitious ontries. Since the matter is being reviewed by
the Bepartrent of Justice, it would be inappropriate for re
to discuss it,

Sincerely yours, 7

Federal Bureau of Investigation

P. 0. Box 1033
Berkeley, California 94704

Dear Mr. Jones:

As you are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the nature of the

-— Bureau's involvement in local law enforcement affairs. This concern has been
heightened by my appointment to the House Select Committee to Investigate the
U.S. Intelligence Community. In this light, I am requesting answers to the
following questions concerning FBI activity in Berkeley:

1.
2.

What is the size of the contingent of agents in the Berkeley field office?

What are the functional responsibilities in the field office, and what are
the percentages of agents involved in each, i.e., political, drug abuse,
criminal, etc.?

What are the titles of the agents, and how do these relate to their
involvement in category two?

What is “the ethnic and sexual veo of the staff and agents in the
Berkeley field office? ~.

What are the interactions and working relationships between the field
office, the Berkeley Police Department, the University of California

Police Department, private security agencies and informers? How many
informers are utilized by the field office?

Recent disclosures have raised serious questions regarding the Bureau's

involvement in political surveillance activities of organizations and
individuals over the past several years. What actions has the local
field office taken to correct the abuses of these actions, and what
political surveillance is being undertaken?

Dear Congressman Dellums:

] This is in response te your letter dated
May 28, 1975, sent to the Senior Resident Agent
of the Berkeley, California, FBI Resident Agency.

To clarify your inquiries, it should be noted
the Resident Agency at Berkeley, California, operates
under the geheral supervision of the FBI's
San Francisco Office.

There are currently nineteen Special Agents

assigned to the Berkeley Resident Agency. All are white
J males. The function of a resident agency is to handle
all FBI matters within its specific geographical
territory. This ineludes criminal, security and
applicant investigations. The FBI does not have primary
jurisdiction regarding drug matters and does not
{conduct “political” investigations.

&

JUL 2.5 1975

As a matter of policy, the FBI advises other
governmental law enforcement agencies of matters coming
te our attention which are within the investigative
jurisdiction of those agencies. In some cases there is

x concurrent jurisdiction and a joint investigation may
| § be conducted; however, local law enforcement agencies
A do not have access to FBI files. Representatives

conduct "political" investigations, nor do we conduct
“political surveillances." We do, of course, have a
vesponsibility for conducting domestic intelligence
investigations authorized under legislative enactments,
Presidential Directives and instructions of the
Attorney General. These matters relate to espionage,
sabotage, treason, sedition, and other activities

. involving the internal security of the United States.
The policies relating to such investigations are
not made on an ad hoc basis by individual
Agents or individual offices, but conform with broad
policy applicable to all offices.

i Anstruction for law, enforcement personnel throughout
“the United Statea, including such subjects as

By memorandum dated October 9, 1975, captioned "U.S. $
House Seleck Committee on Intelligence Activities" addressed to —
you, we furnished our rationale for purchasing equipment from the 8
U.S. Recording Company. In brief, our arrangements with the U.S. ~
Recording Company were dictated by national security considera-
tions. O£ our purchases from the U.S. Recording Company for the /
period of July 1, 1969, through September 11, 1975, 65 percent
were of confidential naturé. In making our purchases through
this company under confidential arrangements, we hopefully will
preclude hostile foreign intelligence services from learning the ~< ,
type of equipment this Bureau uses. It is felt that the rationale
behind the arrangements for tho confidential purchase of such
equipment still exists and should be continued.

Some Intelligence Agencies Don't Report on Electronic Surveillance
Equipment

NBC reported Wednesday that some of the federal intelligence
agencies that are required by law to report on the quantity
of electronic surveillance equipment yearly have refused to
comply with the requirement.

Carl Stern (NBC) reported that in 1968, FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover declined to furnish such information to
Attorney General Ramsey Clark because he didn't like him’
or trust him. "The Central Intelligence Agency not only
ignored the order but three months ago when asked by the
Justice Department why it wasn't obeying reporting require-
ments, said it was not and would not and indicated that it
alone would be the judge of what the law requires. The
Justice Department has not chosen to press the matter,"
i Stern said. The Secret Service has not reported in the
past but is now, he added.

When asked for copies of the reports from the various
agencies, the Justice Department said it had lost them and
had to ask the agencies for duplicates.

"So much for supervision of electronic eavesdropping.
With that sort of vigilance it is not hard to understand
how abuses occur even if laws and regulations are coming
out of our ears," Stern said. -- NBC Today Show

FBI Accused
Of Laxity on
‘Tap’ Laws

By George Lardner, Jr,
Washington Post Staff Writer

‘The FBI has secretly bought
thousands of dollars worth of
electronic surveillance
equipment through a front
company that added 30 per
cent to the prices, the House
Intelligence Committee was
told yesterday. o

The allegation was one of
many leveled at a hearing that
showered the bureau with
charges of laxity and in-
difference in enforcing anti-
eavesdropping laws and even
with connivance in violating
them, 7

One witness, Martin L.
Kaiser, whose Maryland firm
manufactures electronic
surveillance and coun-
termeasure equipment, said
that he sold approximately
$100,000 worth of such devises
to the FBI over a five-year
period, but that he was always.
ordered to route it through the
US Recording Co., a private
firm here. ’

He said he finally refused to
do business with US Recor-

- ding in late 1973. The FBI,
Kaiser said, has made no such

. purchases from him since

* alfnough it has continued to
bey bomb-detection equip-
ment that he has always sold
to the bureau directly.

Other highlights of the

_ hearing:
— Rep. Ronald V, Dellums.
:@-Calif.) disclosed that the
Phone at his congressional
“district offices in Berkeley
“was monitored with highly
sophisticated equipment in
“1972, apparently by a

s

government agency. and that

wiretappi, Anthony V.
‘Zavala, s! FBI agents, as
well as resentatives of
other’ agencies such as
“Customs .and the former
Bureau of Narcotics and
Dangerous Drugs, were aware
of illegal wiretaps carried out

- by Houston police.

The former U.S. attorney in
Houston, Anthony J.P. Farris,
told of repeated failures tc
persuade the FBI to conduct a
serious investigation of illegal

electronic surveillance by the-

Houston police. Farris, who
left office in December, said
appeals to FBI Director
Clarence M. Kelley and for-
mer Attorney General
William B. Saxbe resulted in
“nothing — zip.”

“Saxbe didn’t answer.
Kelley didn't answer . . . no
one answered,” Farris said.
“T don’t think they were
listening.”

‘The FBI had no immediate -
“comment on the equipment

purchases nor any of the other
charges leveled. Kaiser said
his dealings with the FBI
begah around 1967 or 1968 but
except on one occasion, “The
FBI would never correspond.
with me. Instead they sent
agents to my factory who
selected equipment and made
large orders.”

‘The FBI, Kaiser said, also
directed him not to send the

> equipment to the bureau, but +

to U.S. Recording. When he
told the bureau that federal
law would not allow him to sell
some of the equipment to
anyone “except a bona fide
governmental agency,’
Kaiser said the FBI supplied
US. Recording with a stamp

certifying that the purchases -

“were in accordance with U.S.
Taw.”

Under questioning by Rep.
David Treen (R-La.), Kaiser
said he learned of the 30 per
cent markup U.S, Recording
was charging the FBI by
happenstance ona visit at the
Old Post Office Building to the
FSI official he dealt with.

Kaiser said he noticed some
paperwork = from U.S.
Recording on the FBI of-
ficial’s di looked at it and
the prices .with
what he'd been charging.

testified he was rec

contacted by a distributorship
in Massachusetts that “had
received a request for my

doing business with
Recording in 1973, K

equipment to be routed
through U.S. Recording.”

{he Massachusetts firm’s
brochure shows a 100 per cent
markup in. the price he
charges, Kaiser said, and the
equipment “will undoubtedly
receive a further mark up at
the hand of U.S. Recording on.
the way to its ultimate con-
sumer.”

Kaiser said his dealings
with other government
agencies, such as the Bureau
of Narcotics and Dangerour
Drugs, often involved routing
equipment through Ft.
Holabird, “which was Army
intelligence at the time,” as
though it were an Army
purchase.

Recounting his experiences .

publicly for the first time,
Dellums said the sophisticated
“high-frequency radio elec-
tronic surveillance” on his
Berkeley office phone was
discovered in 1972 after a draft
protester, visiting his office
for advice, called his parents
and told them where he was
living. When the FBI arrested
the individual a short time
later, Dellums and his staff
became suspicious and

- enlisted the help of an expert

than at the University of

California at Berkeley.

Dellums said the sur-
veillance did not involve any

equipment inside the phone

that he could hold or produce,

but he said the expert signed -

an affidavit saying that
electronic eavesdropping was
taking place. Dellums said he
was later told by employees of
Pacific Telephone that they
had been asked to monitor
phone conversations from his
California offices, but com-
pany security officials denied
it.

FB.L Said.to Hat Ignored Illegal Pgfice Wiretaps

Special to The New York Times
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9—A
former United States attorney
told the House Select Com
tee_on Inelligence today that
the Federal Bureau of Investi.
gation had failed, despite -re-
. peated requests from his office,
to investigate adequately alle-
gations of widespread illegal
witetapping by members of the
Houston Police Department.
‘The former oificial, Antho-
ny J. BP. Farris, who served
until Jast year as the Federal

Government's chief prosecutor;

in Houston, testified that when
indications of illegal police|
wiretapping first became public|
Jate in the summer of 1973,
he and his assistants began
to press the F.B.L. office there;
to investigate the matter.
¥aAfter a formal, written
quest was finally sent in April]

of last year to the head of|'

the Bureau's Houston field of-
fice, Mr, Farris said, the F.B.1’s|
response was “to assign one|

agent to this complex inyest

tion of the country’s fifth-lar-}

gest police department.” _

QThe resulting investigative
reports, he added, “were notab-
Je only in their lack of sub-|
stance [and] depth, and consist-
ed largely of Xeroxed newspa-
sper articles.”

Intelligence Risks?

‘Mr. -Farris made his asser-
‘tions as the House committee|
began a new series of hearings
‘into what its chairman, Repre-
sentative Otis’ G. Pike, has}
termed the “risks” posed to
national and domestic security|
by the  intelligence-gathering
practices of Federal agencies.

Mr, Pike, a Long Istand, De-
mocrat, said that this phase|
of his committee’s investigation
‘would touch on electronic sur-
veillance and would examine|
“the risk. of average people|
having their personal communi-,
cations intercepted by govern-|
ment and private agencies.”

dnd Dangerous Drugs, and|
eventually “became second

All of the illegal police wire-|
taps were initiated, according!
to Mr. Zavaia, with the acquies-

nical information necessary for
the installations.
Mr. Zavala provided th:

House committee with several
instances in which he had eith-|

agents or supplied th rorma-|
tion gleaned from such a te-1
to a Federal agent.

to begin serving a three-year

By JOSEPH VOLZ"
Washington, Oct. 9 (News Bureau)—A former fed-

eral prosecutor said today that FBI officials deliberately
dragged their feet in investigation charges that the Drug

Enforcement Administration,

Houston police and the FBI

itself illegally eavesdropped on drug suspects.

Anthony Ferris former U.S.
attorney in Texas, told the Huse
Intelligence Committee that he
had asked the FBI to investigate
two years ago after Internal
Revenue. Service agents had
found evidence of illegal elec-
tronic , surveillance by Houston
police.

In April 1974 the one FBI
agent assigned to the case file:
a report “which was notadl
only in its lack of substance;
depth and consisted largely of
newspaper articles,” Farris said-
He added that he wrote to
Attorney General William Saxbe
rnd other high Justice Depart-
ment officials, but their response

was “zip.”

: ‘Nine Cops Indicted

Farris contended that FBI
agents work so closcly with po-
lice departments around the
country that they do not want to
inyestigate them. :

+ Nine Houston cops were in-
dicted, however, in May 1974 but
no federal agents have been
charged. Fl

+ One convicted former Houston
cop, Anthony Zavala, who begins
2 three-year prison term in two
‘oaeks, testified that he personal-
ly participated in 38 illegal wire-
taps between’ 1965 and 1972, He
estimated that the Houston nar-
cotics division planted as many

as 1,000 illegal taps during’ the}
four-year period. ‘Texas has nol
law authorizing police wiretap- |
ping, although in many. states, :
including New York, police may
legally wiretap if they obtain a
court order. Federal agents also
must go to court.

Zavala said that agents of the
FBI, the Drug Enforcement

ministration and the Customs
Bureau were frequent visitors to
Houston police headqnarters to
find out the results of the taps.

Office Bugged, Ile’s Told
R (D-

q Ronald DeHums
Casif.), 2 committee member,
said he was told that his con-;
gressional office phone was tap-
ped. Dellums said he hired an
electronics expert in 1972. The
expert did not actually find a
bug or device in the office but
discovered evidence that an out-
side electronic gadget was being
used to listen to phone conversa-
tions.

Martin Kaiser, president of
Martin Kaiser, Ine., which makes
bugging equipment, — testified
that he sold $100,000 worth to
the FBI. He said that the FBI
tried to be so hush)hush about
the snooping gear that it later
denied it had any of his gear
when he offered to update out-
moded equipment.
