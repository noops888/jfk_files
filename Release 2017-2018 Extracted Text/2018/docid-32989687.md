pen

To recommend that Legal Counsel Division consult

with the Department to seek guidance as to the manner in

which the Bureau should respond to HSC requests for materials

in Bureau files relating to organizations and individuals

to ascertain how Bureau personnel should respond to similar

inquiries while giving testimony in either Executive or

public sessions.

DETAILS:

In September and October, 1975, the HSC requested,

among other items, information from Bureau files concerning

a number of individuals associated with the Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) and information from the file on the Institute

IOr POLICy stUdIeS (IIN), as well as the file of former

Bureau informant Earl Robert Merritt, JT.

On 11/5/75, Bureau representatives Mr. W. R. Wannall,

MT. R. L. Shackelford, and Nr. D. Ryan furnished depositions

to the HSC concerning numerous matters including Bureau

investigations of

5 individuals affiliated with the SW

and this Bureau's investigation of the IPS. HSC representatives

indicated at that time, that these topics will be the sub-

ject of testimony scheduled for public session 11/18/75.

With regard to HSC inquiries concerning the 5 SWP individuals,

the thrust of the inquiries centered around this Bureau's

authority to investigate the SWP and its members, which is

one of the main issues

• to be resolved in a pending civil

suit which the SWP has

brought against the Bureau.

With

regard to the IPS, HSC inquiries centered around this

Bureau's authority to masticate this organization, as

well as public charges

against this bureau of

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

U.S. House Select Committee On Intelligence (HSC)

Earl Robert Merritt, Jr., a former Bureau informant who

furnished information concerning the IPS.

Merritt have been publicly refuted by this Bureau. It

is noted that the IPS is also currently involved in

cIvil litigation with this Bureau charging illegal

wiretapping and breaking and entering.

Additionally, on 11/5/75, 2 Bureau Agents,

against whom. Merritt has levied his unfounded charges, were

deposed by HSC members at which time the Agents were

accompanied by the Departmental Attorney who is handling

this litigation.

OBSERVATIONS:

In view of the pending HSC request for material

relating to lis, as well as intormation pertaining to

barl Robert Merritt, Jr., who is to be a principal witness

in the IPS civil litigation, and because the HSC

representatives

have indicated that the questioning of

Bureau officials scheduled for the HSC public hearing on

11/18/75 will involve matters directly related to the

Government's actions in the defense of the civil suits

regarding both the IPS and SW, it is felt that Departmental

advice should be sought prior to this Bureau responding

to or engaging in further response to the HSC in these areas.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1) That Legal Counsel Division consult with the

Department to obtain advice as to how the Bureau should

respond to HSC requests for materials concerning IPS and

Merritt, and advise the Intelligence Division by memorandum

of the results.

2) Legal Counsel Division should determine from

the Department,

the parameters to which Bureau representatives

should confine their testimony in either Executive or public

This is to furnish information regarding the deposition of

Assistant Director Wannall, Section Chief Robert L. Shackelford and

Supervisor David Ryan of the Intelligence Division (INTD) furnished

to staff members of the House Select Committee (HSC) on 11/5/75.

Memorandum from Legal Counsel Division to Mr. Adams

dated 11/5/75 was approved releasing the above INTD personnel from

the provisions of Code of Federal Regulations and existing employ-

ment agreement for the purpose of furnishing a deposition to the HSC

concerning special indices, including ADEX, Cointelpro-type

activities after 1971, electronic surveillance approval procedures,

informants and investigative procedures in the intelligence field.

The INTD personnel were deposed in a small conference room in the

HSC offices, B316, Rayburn House Office Building from 2 p. m.

until approximately 6:15 p.m. Representing the HSC staff, all of

whom participated in the questioning, were Richard Vermeire, Tim

Oliphant, John M. Atkisson and Ellen Miller. Jerry Rudolph and

Mickey Coplan were present as court reporters. The INTD represent-

atives were placed under oath by HSC Staff Director A. Searle Field

who immediately thereafter departed and did not further participate.

No effort was made to advise the INTD representatives of their rights.

Mr. Wannall, pribs to the questioning, queried as to

REC 6847-11-4444-1602

whether the deposition was to be classified. Mr. Vermeire, who

generally led the questioning throughout the deposition, responded

first that the Congressmen on the HSC would determine what should

be classified or discussed in public testimony and then indicated that a

Re: Houstudy

in accordance with the rules of the Committee nothing would be pub-

licized without the knowledge of the FBI. Later in the meeting the

question of classification arose again and the HSC staff members

indicated confusion and an inability to specifically outline the

classification procedure.

The questioning opened with Mr. Wannall being asked if

he had knowledge of any electronic surveillance coverage of Congress-

men. It was subsequently determined the HSC staff had specific

reference to our microphone coverage of a hotel room in New York City

in the 1960's wherein Congressman Cooley, who was associated with

a sugar lobby, was monitored. It also became apparent the question

was based upon information recently furnished to the Committee by

former Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan. Thereafter a

wide range of responsibilities, activities and operations of the INTD

were discussed in what can only be described as a "shotgun" manner.

Some of the topics discussed, which the Committee staff members

indicated would probably be discussed again in public were: security

index; informant procedures; electronic surveillance matters and

approval procedures; jurisdiction; surreptitious entries; Cointelpro

history, philosophy and techniques; the Socialist Workers Party (SWP);

the Vietnam Veterans Against the War; the Institúte for Policy Studies

(IPS) investigation; trash covers; former informant Robert Merritt, JI.;

number of arrests of "Soviet illegal agents" and U. S. citizens en-

gaged in espionage; persona non grata matters; retention of FBI

records policy; etc.

Specifically, it was indicated the following

individuals who have been affiliated with the SWP and about whom

there are allegations of improper investigation would be discussed

at public hearings: Kathye Zahrie, Norma Lodico, Bruce Bloy, Mark

Rich, Matilde Zimmerman. Although it was pointed out to the HSC

members of the Committee desired the matters could be discussed

in executive session. Additionally, it was indicated Cointelpro-type

action effected against the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

to preclude it from obtaining a loan, Ralph Abernathy as relates to his

involvement in child molestation, and as relates to Father Taylor (not

further described) would be discussed in forthcoming hearings.

Mr. Oliphant of the HSC staff indicated as soon as the

record of this deposition was transcribed a copy would be furnished

to the FBI for editing. When this copy is received, you will be

further advised together with appropriate recommendations.

ACTION:

For information. Appropriate Section Chiefs will have

background material prepared as necessary relating to above matters

to be discussed at hearings before the HSC.

On November 4, 1975, Inspector

Thomas

Leavitt and I

briefed Emily Sheketoff of the House Select Committee on

Intelligence with respect to our counterintelligence respon- DrawdAn

sibilities. At the close of the briefing, Emily Sheketoff

asked if she could be furnished with data concerning infiltration

of Congressional staffs.

On November 5, 1975, Emily Sheketoff called, at which

time I referred her to a letter directed to Mr. Kelley dated

October 22, 1975, from Mr. Aaron B. Donner, Counsel to the

Select Committee.

I noted that Mr.

Donner

specifically would

like to know the

extent with which

"Russian spies have

infiltrated our country and Capitol Hill as well."

I told

Emily Sheketoff that we were responding to this letter and our

answer would cover the question raised by herself. She said

this was not so, and she wanted specific information from the

Bureau on those staff members on Capitol Hill who were giving

out information to hostile services.

She noted that Mr. Donner's

letter was limited to Russian spies and she stated that

she was

interested in any hostile elements - East German, Polish, or others.

I requested Emily Sheketoff to go to her Chairman

and have the Chairman forward the request to the Bureau in

writing. She said she would do this and would have the letter

in my hands today. I asked that she have the letter forwarded

through regular established channels.

She noted that this would

involve sending the letter to Mi. Michael to shaneen, Ji., in the

Justice Department and this always meant delay.

In this case

she stated that she needed the answer certainly by the close of

business on November 7. I told Emily Sheketoff that I could not

make any commitments but certainly we would put forth our best efforts.

made available if the target services in each instance were

identified as 'communist intelligence services" throughout,

thus providing additional protection to our bilaicral operations

Since the material furnished indicated that a similar

requesi had been directed to Navy and Air Force and the suspense

date

was 10/15/75, inquiry vas made of Charles Torpy, OStHC,

and Jack: Donnelley,

NISHQ, as to the status. of requests from

those agencies. Neither individual vas aware of the situation

but both subséquetly advised that their services had concluded

that the request pertained only to PI collection; therefore,

Ithey vere not preparing any response involving bilateral CI ang

Ce operations with the EBi.

This information vas relayed to

Foshrasht on 10/14/75

at which time he indicated that the proposed information, based

on above-described revisions, rould be submitted to the Office of

reform

group, was quoted as stating, "Hopefully we can raise

people's consciousness so they can realize an abortion is very

minor surgery."

The group was to hold its first meeting on

January 13, 1972.

In part, according to SLEDGE, the UW Hall

Health Center could perform abortions on students free or

cheaply, whereas the University Hospital charged $300, which

was beyond the average student's limits.

fore-

see any political

conflicts within the new group.

on a student visa from Canada.

According to bAhRalE, ne came

BABAK from being deported to Ixan.

He said his knowledge

and it would be self-de-

ing the off-reservation fishing rights, the state of

feating for them to knowingly damage the fish

runs.

Although the federal government has filed the

suit on behalf of the 14 tribes, the Indians view

the aims of the government with distrust. At the

trial, this reporter spoke with one Indian who

said that individual tribe members are not at all

satisfied with the way the federal government is

representing them.

A member of the Yakima tribe said: "Many otner

tribes wanted to pull out. But we decided that

we want to go through with the suit aná pour

into the case every bit of fact, research, biology,

history, and anthropology we can and use the

courtroom as a tract to get the record straight.

It also helps to inform the public of our struggle.

"If we don't win at this level," he continued,

"we will have under us a solid and complaia legal

basis for further reviews once it reaches the Ninth

Circnit Court."

The Indians believe that the state fisheries de-

partment and the lederal government are very

close to each other in the case. "They could prac-

tically sit down and agree on this case between

themselves right now," said Fred Lane, tribal co-

Washington says

the Indians can fish only on

their

reservations and

then

only for a limited

amount of fish,

"so as not to deplete the resources."

The state game department has placed a blanket

ban on the netting

of steelhead (a type of trout)

and other fish by the Indians, declaring the steel-

head game fish only: Some 100 Indians currently

face trial for fishing off the reservations, and the

arrests continue as the trial here goes on.

State officials have continually charged that the

tribes do not know how to regulate their off-res-

ervation fishing and thus threaten the conserva-

tion of steelhead and salmon..

At the trial, however, biologist and fisheries ex-

pert Dr. James Heckman testified to the contrary.

The Indians

"know much more

about the fish

and fishing than many of us learn in college,"

he said. According to Heckman's figures, the In-

dians take only

5 to 6 percent of the total catch

in the area, the rest going to sports fishing and

commercial catches.

Over the past 50 years the annual salmon catch

, ordinator.

Lane also pointed out that "the state has ailed

to recognize the fac that the treaty rights of In-

dians never belonged to the state in the first place.

They were original rights held by the Indians

before there was a state and reserved for them-

selves in an honored agreement with the federal

government while Washington was still a territory."

Furthermore, the federal government has allowed

the state to develop two completely different cases.

The fisheries department argues that it does rec-

ognize treaty rights, and simply asks the court

to determine the scope of those rights so it can

regulate them. The game department, on the other

hand, says the Indians have no treaty rights,

- and refuses to concede that it should allow any

tribal fishing at all.

Despite these obstacles,

the Indians

say they

are determined to

"fight as our ancestors have

for over 100 years iur our rights, as the original

inhabitants of this land, to fish and sustain our-

selves."

that

the method oi selection by the House Select Comittee was such

that the Comnittee was not obtaining the best possible witnesses and

that in most inatances

It would be benaficial for both the Comittee

and the Bureau for the Bureau to have an Input into the witness

selection procesa.

It was indicated to Vermeire that the Burea

mon learning of the tople that was the subject of a beasing could

suggest the witness that would be the nost knowledgeable concerning

that particular natter and, more importantly, be in a position

address policy questions which right arise during a hearing.

Vernelte stated that,

generally, in the future he in

tended to consult the Bureau

nrior to requesting a partictlar

witness so that the connittee sdeht avoid urchlans such as- those

that vere posed during the testimony of Unit Chiei James C. Kraus.

He stated that he could not make a coumituent for the Committee

that the Bureau would have an Input into the sitnese selection

process; however,

he stated that both he and Toothy Oliphant,

Staff Menber of the louse Select Cormittee, felt strongly that

This recommends House Select Committee on

Intelligence (HSC) Staff be given Limited access to o&cal

file material under same guidelines which were applied when

we permitted Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSC)

Staff access to it.

Letter from Department 10/6/75 forwarded HSC

request dated 10/3/75 requesting that we deliver "all files,

memoranda and materials found in former Director, J. Edgar

Hoover's safe, after his death." Department memorandum

requested discussion with us regarding response to HSC

request. From 10/9/75 to 10/21/75, Michael E. Shaheen, Jim

and Steven Blackhurst, Special Counsels for Intelligence

Coordination of the Department, negotiated with the HSC on

this request. On 10/21/75, Mr, Blackhurst informed us that

the HSC will accept the same guidelines which applied in

our granting SSC access to 0 & C material. Single copies

of the aforementioned guidelines? fiff aforementioned

correspondence are attached.

Procedure followed with

SEC 35+

to first make

42 144-464-145

available for review the excised summaries of the 0 & C

files prepared by the Inspection Division. Review of these

summaries, while not disclosing derogatory information to

which the Committees are not privy, served to have the SfG -

ZENGOSURE eliminate fron further consideration some files which were

of no interest to the SSC.

Thereafter, Supervisor HughS

NOV # 1975

Mallet, now of Legal Counsel Division,

met with Committee

Staff, holding possession of the actual O & C files and

responding, according.: to guidelines, to inquiries by Staff

for pertinent information. This procedure satisfied SSC

requirements and it is hoped that following the same process

will satisfy HSC, while protecting our interests.

Re:

Houstudy 75

62-116464

The 0 & C material is, of course, closely held

and it will be necessary initially for Mr. Mallet to meet

with HSC Statt for the handling of the 0 & C material,

inasmuch as he is most familiar with the necessary process.

However, in view of Mr. Mallet's other current responsibilities,

a representative of the Intelligence Division will be phased

into this process as soon as possible.

Richard Vermiere, HSC Staff Member, informed

Supervisor Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel Division, 10/21/75,

that he

would like to begin review of O & C material 10/23/75.

However, on 10/22/75, he told Mr. Daly that he would be out

of town on 10/23 and

10/24/75 and would therefore contact

us thereafter to make arrangements for review of this material.

ACTION:

With your approval, we will proceed as indicated

above to grant limited access by HSC Staff to O & C material.

SUBJECT:

0 E C Files AccEss

The procedures which were adonted on Jilly 24, 1975, will

ultimately apply to access quacéions involved in the 0 & C Files.

I have discussed tho C & C Files and our concurns about them with

the Senate Sclact Committee staff and have reached an agreement

which the bureau finds most satisfactory. The agreement, wich

I propose to carry out, is as follows:

the tams of the Prosecures.

As to those files which contain

ferosatory infomation, access will be wither foreves, ine

file wul be held an the cablocy on special asant top already

in an inteview loat. The derogatony intormation will, thus,

not be disclosed, ed the SSC staff members do not rant to have

it; however, the information as to the proceduras which resuited

in the collection of the derogatory information, and any disposi-

Mr. Clarence M. Kelley, Director

Washington, D.C. 20535

Dear Mr. Kelley:

I want to thank you for your reply to my inquiry concerning Bureau operations

within Berkeley. I would like to follow up that reply with an additional

inquiry into some of the policy matters which underpin that response.

1. I was frankly surprised to note the size of the contingent of Agents op-

1975

erating from the Berkeley Field Office (19), and would appreciate knowing

how this compares to other cities of 100,000 population?

In addition,

how does this compare to other cities of 100,000 population which are

located within a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area of the size of

Francisco-Oakland SMSA and which have other major offices

this instance offices are located in San Francisca and Oakland aù Teast)? l

.?.

What are the Bureau's policies regarding "affirmative action" or assignment

to areas with substantial minority communities? Berkeley has a Black

population of some 25% and a population of other minorities around 10%,

yet the Field Office is 100% white/male.

Is this a situation which the

BureBureau tries to avoid, or is it not a consideration?

3.

What percentage of the Offices time is devoted to those categöries of

activity which are labeled as "domestic intelligence and internal,

4.

What plans are there for deploying SWAT teams

are Agents subordinate to or restrained by the Berkeley Police Department

in utilizing SWAT teams?

Would the Bureau refrain from SWAT type deployment

at the request of the local jurisdiction?

These questions are of particular

concern to me in light of the decision, and appropriate one I believe, of

Chief Agent Bates to avoid the use of such force in apprehending the rampants

of the so-called Symbionese Liberátion Army. 62 114 345

5. Has the Bureau utilized so-called "black bag" operations in carrying

out its mission in Berkeley? If so, how many type operations were

carried out? When were they carried out, and if they have been term-

carried

inated, when were they so terminated?

I thank you for your consideration of this further inquiry and look forward

to your reply.

Dear Mr. Jones:

As you are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the nature of the

Bureau's involvement in local law enforcement affairs.

This concern has been

heightened by my appointment to the House Select Committee to Investigate the

U.

S. Intelligence Community. In this light, 1 am requesting answers to the

following questions concerning FBI activity in Berkeley:

1. What is the size of the contingent of agents in the Berkeley field office?

2. What are the functional responsibilities in the field office, and what are

the percentages of agents involved in each, i.e., political, drug abuse,

criminal, etc.?

3.

What are the titles of the agents, and how do these relate to their

involvement in category two?

4.. What is the ethnic and sexual breakdown of the staff and agents in the

Berkeley field office?

5. What are the interactions and working relationships between the field

office, the Berkeley Police Department, the University of California

Police Department, private security agencies and informers?

How many

informers are utilized by the field office?

6. Recent disclosures have raised serious questions regarding the Bureau's

involvement in political surveillance activities of organizations and

individuals over the past several years. What actions has the local

field office taken to correct the abuses of these actions, and what

political surveillance is being undertaken?

There are currently nineteen Special Agents

As I have already Indicated, the FBI does not

conduct "political" investigations, nor do we conduct

"political surveillances."

We do, of course, have a

responsibility for conducting domestic intelligence

investigations authorized under legislative enactments,

Presidential Directives and instructions of the

Attorney General. These matters relate to espionage,

sabotage, treason, sedition, and other activities

involving the Internal security of the United States.

The policies relating to such investigations are

not made on an ad hoc basis by individual

Agents or individual offices, but conform with broad

policy applicable to all offices.

The FBI offers a variety of courses of

instruction for law entorcement personnel throughout

the United States, including such subjects as

anti-sniper and survival trashang and special weapons and

tactics, commonly known as

The basic purpose

of this

training is to provide well prepared

with a minimum of risk to innocent bystanders, the law

'of the training of our own personnel in this field.

report on the quantity of electronic surveillance equipment in

our possession.

By memorandum dated October 9, 1975, captioned "u.s.

you, we furnished our rationale for purchasing equipment from the

U.S. Recording Company.

In brief, our arrangements with the u.s.

Of our purchases from the U.S. Recording Company for the

period of July 1, 1969, through September 11, 1975, 65 percent

were of confidential nature.

In making out purchases through

this company under confidential arrangements, ve hopcíully will

preclude hostile foreign intelligence services from learning the

type of equipment this Bureau uses.

It is felt that the rationale

behind the arrangoments for the confidential purchase of such

equipment still exists and should be continued.

The requirement for the submission of an annual in

vontory relating to electronic surveillance equipment vas set

forth in the Attorney Genoral's "Hemorandum to the Heads of

Some Intelligence Agencies Don't Report on Electronic Surveillance

Equipment

NBC reported Wednesday that some of the federal intelligence

agencies that are required by law to report on the quantity

of electronic surveillance equiprent yearly have refused to

comply with the requirement.

Carl Stern (NBC) reported that in 1968, FBI Director

J. Edgar Hoover declined to furnish such information to

Attorney General Ramsey Clark because he didn't like him

or trust him.

"The Central Intelligence Agency not only

ignored the order but three months ago when asked by the

Justice 'Department why it wasn't obeying reporting require-

ments, said it was not and would not and indicated that it

alone would be the judge of what the law requires.

The

Justice Department has not chosen to press the matter,"

Stern said. The Secret Service has not reported in the

past but is now, he added.

When asked for copies of the reports from the various

agencies, the Justice Department said it had lost them and

had to ask the agencies for dupiicates.

"So much for supervisión of electronic eavesdropping.

With that sort of vigilance it is not hard to understand

how abuses occur even if laws and regulations are coming

out of our ears," Stern said. -- NBC Today Show

At 2:41 p.m. on October 10, 1975, a caller identifying

herself as Susan Poor, employed as a Research Assistant by the House

Select Committee, advised me that the Committee needed background

data concerning William C. Sullivan, former Assistant to the Director.

She indicated that the Committee would need such information during the

early part of the week of October 13th. I asked her whether she needed

information such as the dates of his Bureau employment and his assignment

and she indicated that was the nature of the information desired.

It appears that the Committee is planning to call Mr. Sullivan

as a witness. It would be appropriate for us to respond by furnishing the

Committee background data concerning Mr. Sullivan's employment with the

FBI.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That the Administrative Division prepare in letterhead memorandum

format a background summary concerning Mr. Sullivan's dates of employment

and his assignments in the FBI.
