FROM : M. D. Stevens

DATE: 30 Docember 1963

SUBJECT: OSWALD CASE

1. Reference in made to the attached copy of an Incoming

State Department telegram dated 19 December 1963, In connection with

the Harvey Lee OSAID Cese (see Tab A). This telogram concerns & Mr.

and NEE, DEMOIRBHSCHILNT tho appear to have lived 12 Dallas, Texas,

but on 2 June 1963 went to Halti and have not since returned to the

United States.

2. Acoording to this telegram, the DIMOHRKNSCHILDTS vere

Interviewed at Port au Prince on 19 December 1963 at which time they

stated that they left Dallas on 19 Aprll (1963) for Hew York and

OSWAID on their Mey vialt to Dallas.

3. The above referred to incoming telegram makes reference to

prior messages of which I have not received copies and it Is Impossible

to determine what connection the DEVOERRISCHIDTE have with the OSWAID

Case. The telegran refers to the fact that Mrs. DEMOHREISCHTTDT believed

she "saw gun at apertment" In Oakleaf, a Dallas suburb. (The Hew Yark

Times of 20 December 1963, in referring to the arrest of Russell W. NCLARRE

of Dallas on charges of having threatened on 21 lovember 1963 that he was

going to kill President Kennedy the next day, stated that MCLARRY lives 1n

an apartment house

"In the Oakellff section of Dallas, & sprawling area

where OSHAID Lived". (See paragraph 3 of Tab A). It appears from Information

In the telegram thit the DEMORINSCHTLOTs were wall acquainted with the

OSWALDE. Mrs. DEMOHRENSCHILDT took Mrs. OSWAID in ber ear from Fort Worth

to Dallas for dental treatment a week or two after they firet met OSWALD.

4. According to Mr. and MrB. DEMOHRENSCHILDT, they were

interested in the OSWALDs solely in helping them as "unfortunate people".

They named the following persons who might have additional information

regarding the OSWALDs: SamuelYBALLON, an; lavestment banker 10 Dallas,

to whom OSWALD applied for a job, and Theo MilLER and his Russian wife.

Security Indices contain no Information

On BALTON OF MPLIER. BALLEN was mentioned at length in a Washlagton Post

article on 1 December 1963 as a petroleum economist who interviewed OSWALD

for a job.
