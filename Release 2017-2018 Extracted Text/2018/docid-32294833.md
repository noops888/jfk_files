Re Philadelphia letter to the Bureau 3-22-61.

Information contained in referenced communication was.
made available to and discussed with Colonel MALCOLM CUMMING, i
official of British Security Service, MI-5. Colonel CUMMING : ‘4
advised that MI-5 for a number of years has developed certain” :
individuals in Lloyds of London as confidential sources. Colonel ~ i
CUMMING at the request of this office contacted these sources . “
at: Lloyds to determine the answers to questions raised by the 4
Philadelphia Office concerning subject's financial dealings |
in the gambling casino at the Plaza Hotel, Havana, Cuba. G)

On April 24, 1961 Colonel CUMMING advised that MI-5's
confidential sources had stated that Lloyds of London had acted }
as the re-insurer for the American International Re-Insurance i
Corporation of New York City to the extent of $70,000 for a :
policy made out to subject in connection with the gambling
casino at the Plaza Hotel, Havana. G6 )

Colonel CUMMING stated in April, 1959, a claim was
paid to subject for $185,000 presumably by the American Inter-
national Re-Insurance Corporation in respect to a fire which
had occurred at the gambling casino, Plaza Hotel, Havana, on

Corporation would not know that the original information came, t- 2

Colonel CUMMING also pointed out that the term
"insured" by Lloyds of London is a misnomer as Lloyds do not
pay out claims to individuals but act as a re-insurance
organization for other insurance companies and any money
paid by Lloyds is paid not to the individual policy holders
but to other insurance companies to help them cover their
losses when heavy demands are put upon their resources by
their own policy holders. ()

No information was obtained indicating subject or
any of his associates had any kind of an insurance policy
other than the fire insurance policy mentioned above and
no information was. available identifying the officers of-
the corporation of which subject was a member, (@,

As there are no further leads outstanding, this
case is being placed in an RUC status. Cw
