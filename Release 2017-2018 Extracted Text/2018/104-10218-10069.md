CARRY ONLY FIVE PASSENGERS ON ITS MEXICO-TO-HAVANA KUN.) WHEN

REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS
ASSISTING THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN MEYICO, (SOURCE COMMENT:
LOPEZ 1S PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE RCOPRRSENTATIVE AT
TAE CUBAN EMBASSY, SINCE HE IS VERY CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND AP=
PEARED TO FEEL THAT THE MEXICANS CONNECTED FITIE.,THE CASE WHO HAD
NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSAGE TO cup.)
