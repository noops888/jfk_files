order to formulate plans for this InvaBion, he had

explained that be

""sucked in" by communist ideology

and became

because the Cubans desired

, the invasion of Panama in their own way.

As a result,

he

was summoned to the office. of RAUL

CASTRO and made to stay in that vicinity until the

Invaders bad departed Cuba.

DAVIDSON recalled that this

had taken place in April of 1959. °

Upon being released, MIRO stated that he bad

fled to Miami, Florida,

whereupon he had immediately

called Panama

and notified unidentified persons of the

imminent Invasion.

MIRO claimed that he had instrueted

that the invaders

be captured but not killed since

they had been deceived by the Cubans.,

MIRO told DAVIDSON that he planned

.to

Invade Panama in January, 1960.

He desired that DAVIDSON

assist him in obtaining $50,000 and enough equipment and

armament to outfit 250 men for the invasion.

DAVIDSON

advised that he had a list of this equipment but could

not locate it at that particular moment, but when it vas

located,

would furnish the list to the FBI.

DAVIDSON

recalled that the list did include icur BY's,

250 - 30

caliber machine guns, 300 Garand rifles, 3,000 "K" rations,

which MIRO indicated

would be enough for ten days, 250

knapsacks,

250 canteens, 250 bayonets,

'an unrecalled

quantity of 60 millimeter mortars, an

unrecalled number

of 100 pound Napalm bombs, and one LST.

DAVIDSON recalled that even though MIRO desired

enough rations for ten days, he had stated that the

Invasion would end in a successful revolution in Panama

concerning the invasion.

He would not identify any

individuals by name,

but indicated that his "green light"

had been obtained through Uniter States officials in the

Panama Canal Zone.

At this point DAVIDSON told MIRO he

was going to check on his story to ascertain 1f, in fact,

he did have any backing from United States Government

officials.

He subsequently told MIRO that he would

contact the FBI, the State Department, and the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA).

There were no specific

objections raised by MIRO and he told DAVIDSON that he

would have to contact high officials to verly his story.

MIRO told DAVIDSON that if his assistance

would be given, DAVIDSON would be granted cutting rights

on 100,000 acres of timber land in Panama subsequent to

the success of the revolution.

DAVIDSON stated that on Decenber 9, 1959,

MIRO reappeared at his office

his efforts to effect an invasian of Panama.

ARAGON

affirmed to DAVIDSON that MIRO had the backing of the

United States Government regarding his plans.

From

that ARAGON had crevisusly been ass.lcted with labor

organizations in Panama and DAVIDSON felt that ARAGON

previously mentioned labor gocus in Washington, D. C.
