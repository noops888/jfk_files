order to formulate plans for this invasion, he had
traveled to Cuba and conferred with Cuban Prenier FIDEL
TRO, his brother, RAULiCASTRO, Head of the Armed

» and Commandante ERNESTO "CHE" \GUEVARA. MIRO
explained that he was “sucked in* by communist ideology
and became disillusioned because the Cubans desired
to conduct?, the invasion of Panama in their own way.
As a result, he was summoned to the office. of RAUL
CASTRO and made to stay in that vicinity until the
invaders had departed Cuba. DAVIDSON recalled that this
had taken place in April of 1959, *

Upon being released, MIRO stated that he had
fled to Miami, Florida, whereupon he had immediately
called Panama and notified unidentified persons of the
imminent invasion, MIRO claimed that he had instructed
that the invaders be captured but not killed since
they had been deceived by the Cubans, :

MIRO told DAVIDSON that he planned .to °
invade Panama in January, 1960. He desired that DAVIDSON
assist him in obtaining $50,000 and enough equipment and
armament to outfit 250 men for the invasion, DAVIDSON
advised that he had a list of this equipment but could
not locate it at that particular moment, but when it was
located, would furnish the list to the FBI, DAVIDSON
recalled that the list did include fcur PBY's, 250 .30
caliber machine guns, 300 Garand rifles, 3,000 "K" rations,
which MIRO indicated would be enough for ten days, 250
knapsacks, 250 canteens, 250 bayonets, ‘an unrecalled
quantity of 60 millimeter mortars, an unrecalled number
of 100 pound Napalm bombs, and one LST,

DAVIDSON recalled that even though MIRO desired
enough rations for ten days, he had stated that the

invasion would end in a successful revolution in Panama
within 72 hours.

MIRO desired that DAVIDSON attempt to acquire
the above material and equipment through the Nicaraguan
Government. He subsequently told DAVIDSON that he, MIRO,
had the complete backing of the United States Governnent

he did have any becking from United States Government
officials. He subsequently told MIRO that he would
