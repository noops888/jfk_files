This information will not be repeated in view
of the fact it is secondhand information and would be
of no value in any Federal,proceedings as testimony, It
is noted that on 12/14/59 SUR TEATS telephonically con-
tacted SA RICHARD B, KELLOGG and advised that he had
learned from LEOPOLDO ARAGON that the proposed “savind ()

had taken place on 12/11/59 in the office of I. IRVING
DAVIDSON as scheduled. MIRO had been turned down by
DAVIDSON but would possibly.attempt to go to Nicaragua,
HEURTEMATTE stated that MIRO apparently convinced DAVIDSON
that he was not a communist and was anti-CASTRO, HEURTEMATTS
ommented that this was not tri and stated that he con-
idered MIRO to be worthless, Bieicon had told HEURTEMATTE
that MIRO usingthe name CARLOS’ VASQUEZ placed_a ca rom

‘Ss
)
The name of and his identity as a
CIA representative has been sé orth in the details of

this report to give a complete picture of the activities
of MIRO and also to show hi, odus operandi. It is noted
that the identity of d-his connection with CIA
is apparently well known as evidencedby the fact that the
end. JOSEPH pane made available to HEURTEMATTE, DAVIDSON,

and JOSEPH}MEROLA of Miami Beach,..Rlorida, through the
endeavors da conversation of MIRO. It is felt by WFO
that other individuals have also been apprised of this
information by MIRO in attempts to find backing for an
invasion of Panama. Due t rygtements made by MIRO
concerning the backing by his vasion efforts,
this report will be classified "Secret."

The Special Agents who observed ARAGON and MIRO
enter 1612 K Street, N.W., on 12/11/59, were KELLOGG,
JAMES CALVIN CONRAD, and CARROLL J. HUNT. It is noted
that SA CONRAD observed DAVIDSON, ARAGON, and MIRO depart
1612 K Street, N.W., at 6:07 p.m., 12/11/59.

Bureau airtel, 12/15/59, instructed WFO to _
submit recommendations concerning further investigative
efforts regarding MIRO. Due to the fact that ARAGON
does not desire to testify for fear of reprisals by MIRO,
it is felt that successful prosecution of the subject
with the information available is doubtful. It is noted
that ARAGON has furnished the only documentary evidence
