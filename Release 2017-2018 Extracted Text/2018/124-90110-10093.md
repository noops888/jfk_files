This information will not be repeated in view

of the fact it is secondhand information and would be

of to value in a peer cecile as testimony. It

is noted that on 12/14/59

He telephonically con

tacted SA RICHARD B. KELLOGG and advised that he had

learned from LEOPOLDO ARAGON that the proposed meeting

had taken place on 12/11/59 in the office of I. IRVING

DAVIDSON as scheduled. MIRO had been turned down by

DAVIDSON but would possibly attempt to go to Nicaragua.

HEURTEMATTE stated that MIRO apparently convinced DAVIDSON

that he was not a communist and was anti-CASTRO. HEURTEMATTE

commented that this was not true and stated that he con-

that MIRO usingthe name CARLOS VASQUEZ placed a caL strom

DAVIDSON's office to Panama telephone number 3-7001 and

attempted

Due to the fact that ARAGON
