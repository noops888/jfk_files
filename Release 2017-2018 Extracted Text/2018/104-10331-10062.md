JFK Records

This is in response to your request that I review ASAP the proposed regulations by the JFK

Assassination Records Review Board.

I see Sheryl Walters hand very much in evidence here. I see from the attachment that she is the Board's

GC. •

Like you, I am very concerned about the breadth of the reg's definitions. The key to keep in mind is the

statutory authority for the Board. I would argue that the definition of "assassination record" in the statute

(44 U.S.C. section 2107 note; section 3(2) of the Act) is more limited than the reg. The statute defines an

assassination record as one "related" to the assassination of JFK. Thus, when section 1400.2 (d) and (e)

of the reg authorize Board access to organizational charts of governmental agencies and records

necessary and sufficient to describe the agency's records policies and schedules, filing systems and

organization, and storage facilities and locations, I would argue that such information is way too far afield.

There is no way we can allow the Board to have access to this information, which in any event is

prohibited by section 403g from disclosure notwithstanding any other law.

The same issue arises with respect to section 1400.7(d) of the reg that proposes to include in the

definition of record any records for a person by another name or personal identifier. This would appear to

authorize Board access to all information about an agent who may have only been tangentially involved in

the assassination but whose crypt is given in many other unrelated documents about unrelated

operations. Talk about your camel's nose under the tent!

Finally, section 1400.5 of the reg raises an old dog of an issue. The National Security Archive (Sheryls

old employer) has been fighting for a long time in FOlA litigation that the FOlA refers to records and that

therefore all information in a responsive record must be released unless otherwise exempt. There is no

FOIA exemption, they argue, for non-responsive material in a record. This is a big problem for multi-topic

documents, such as the NID. We, of course, argue that agencies are only required to process that which

is asked for and delete non-responsive material as unrequested. The proposed reg would mean that the

Board would have access to all information in a document about several unrelated operations or events if

that document even mentioned the assassination or anything related to it. Again, the camel's nose.

JFK Assassination Records

Proposed Regulations

1. Attached for your review and comment is a copy of

proposed regulations prepared by the JFK Assassination

Records Review Board.

The regulations focus on the

definition of "assassination record", which is very broad.

The possibility of requiring additional records searches is

raised.

The Board plans to discuss the regulations at its

next meeting on 6-7 March, so it would be helpful to give

the Board our input in advance of that meeting. Please

provide Barry Harrelson (x30292) or me (x30373) with your

comments by 1 March.
