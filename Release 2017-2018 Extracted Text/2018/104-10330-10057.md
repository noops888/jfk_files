MR. PEREIRA: A pleasure. We’re pleased
to try to help and provide information that might

|give some background to put the sequestered

collection in context for the board.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: That would be very

phelpful. —

MR. PEREIRA: In the spring of 1992, prior
to the enactment of the Assassination Records Act,
the then-Director of Central Intelligence, Robert
Gates, issued instructions to begin reviewing for
declassification all records related to the
assassination.

The CIA history staff was charged with
identifying the relevant records, which they did.
lAnd -once that happened, our group that we
represent, the historical review group, took
custody of the records and immediately began
reviewing them for declassification for release to
the National Archives.

[ Oiice the Records Act was passed, our goal
became to release as many records as possible by
fthe 22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act.
And approximately 125,000 pages were transferred to
the National Archives by that date.

: With subsequent releases, the Agency has

now declassified and transferred some 227,000 pages

MILLER REPORTING .CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


23
to the National Archives. And based on discussions
with the Board, we’re trying to release additional
| information that had been redacted earlier.

The remaining records are in various
stages of review. Some require review by other
agencies. Some is congressional Material. And
final decisions on other records are awaiting
| discussion with the board, as you know.

The Kennedy assassination records in the
CIA consist of two major groups of files.

One group consists of the documents in the
Lee Harvey Oswald file, sometimes referred to as
the Oswald 201 file. ‘These consist mainly of
documents that -were collected after the

assassination and during the Warren Commission

= investigation. And there are about 26,000 pages of

| material in this file. All but a handful have been
declassified and sent to the National Archives.

The second group is one of major interest
to you today, I think. It’s comprised of the
sequestered collection. These are records that

were made available to the House Select Committee

jon Assassination and which the committee asked CIA
n

jto hold in safekeeping upon the completion of the
J committee's investigation.

And there are certain additional records,
including 400 excerpts from the minutes of the
| director of Central Intelligence morning meetings
| ana some working files that have been added since
Jag92. But that’s pretty much the landscape of the
records- we have.

By going directly to the sequestered
collection, I’d like to say that, first of all,
| every document in the sequestered collection was
available to the board for review. Every document
is available in full to the board without
| redactions.

j A’ portion of the documents that were

| created specifically in response to requests from
lene House Assassination Committee are in the

ae | record. Other records were already in existence
Iprior to the creation of the committee. And still

other documents were created by the committee

itself. For example, there are notes of interviews

(202) 546-6666

conducted by the committee's staff.

So, these are the three categories: those
Jcreated for the committee at their request; others
that existed that we provided to them at their

| request; and others that the committee itself
created.

Now, within the sequestered collection,
there are two major categories of records. This is
eee -ja simple breakdown. I hope this is helpful. one
category consists of about 129,000 pages of hard
copy. The second category consists of 72 reels of
imicrofilm or the equivalent of 163,000 pages of
l nara copy.
| Now, the question has come up of why the
documents were sequestered. And this is explained

sin a Memotandum of Understanding, -signed by the

chairman of the Assassination Committee and the
director of Central Intelligence. And I have a
copy here to submit to the board.

: The memorandum states that, "Upon
termination of the Committee, all materials

| provided by CIA and examined by the Committee will

507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002

cm 26

be kept and preserved within a segregated and

| secure area within CIA for at least 30 years,
unless the DCI and the House of Representatives
agree to a shorter period of time."

In April 1979, Robert Blakey, the chief
| counsel and staff director of the Assassinations
Committee, visited CIA headquarters; and he
completed the process of designating what materials
were to. be sequestered. All the- documents made
available to the Assassination Committee were
included in this sequestered collection.

The second question that often comes up
is, where did we get authority to start reviewing
these records prior to the Assassination Act? And
}this goes back to my point about Robert Gates
ranting to get started as quickly as possible in
the ‘review and declassification.
|" So, the Agency wrote to the Speaker of the
|| House, Thomas Foley, in 1992, requesting approval
| to begin declassifying and releasing the records.
And in October of that year, Speaker Foley wrote a

letter to the director, granting CIA the authority

MILLER REPORTING CO., INC.
507 C STREET, N.E.
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20002
(202) 546-6666


27
to do so.

The Speaker's decision was clearly made in

anticipation of passage of the Assassination
Records Collection Act. So, we have the records,
Jand we started processing.

Within the two categories that I
mentioned, the hard. copy material is one. And we
have a page describing that for the board, which
|r/11 leave with you. This includes copies of most
of the CIA- documents and the Oswald 201 file that I
| referred to earlier.

Also included in the hard copy are other
|) 202 files, pérsonnel files, security files on
persons who are. mentioned in documents relevant to
the assassination or who figure in one of the

kconspiracy ,theories.

AY

This part, the hard copy, also includes
about 30,000 pages of documents, memos, and notes

-- many of these, handwritten -- that were created

iby the Assassination Committee itself. So, those
H.

are in the hard copy.
,

Now, the microfilm portion of the

(202) 546-6666

28

Hprinted out in hard copy. So, we have both; and

both of these are available to the board, both the
microfilm itself and the printout.

The decision to microfilm was apparently
based. on two mater considerations, as far as we can

determine from our records. First, the integrity

Jof-the sequestered records had to be maintained.

Second, a number of the files that the

Assassination Committee requested were active

| files, and had to be available to allow people to

continue conducting their normal activities within
tthe Agency.
ee

So, the solution was to replace certain
records with microfilm versions. And these records

were microfilmed during 1979 and 1980 with the

approval of the Assassinations Committee. And we

jhave memos for the records showing how that

}happened, so that you will have the history on

29
that.

Now, looking at the content. of the

microfilm, a sizeable portion of this -- probably
50 percent -- duplicates the hard copy in the
sequestered files. For example, there are 12 reels
of material from the Oswald 201 file.

The bulk of the reels consists of files on
individuals and organizations, including personnel
files of CIA employees. There are also a number of
files on anti-Castro organizations. All but a
small percentage are CIA-originated cables, or
dispatches, or memoranda and other documents.

In looking at the microfilm, we believe
there are questions’ of privacy that the board may
want to consider in determining what information is
sto be reléased. Some of the records, for example,
contain medical information on an individual.

There are also questions of relevancy that
we suggest the board consider. For example, many
of the documents cover sensitive activities that go
far beyond the time frame of the assassination or
Ly

investigations into the assassination.

That‘s rather brief; but I hope this is

Juseful to the board in trying to understand the
sequestered documents, sometimes called segregated
| documents. We use those terms interchangeably.
And we certainly look forward to continuing
| cooperating with the board, with the goal of
| releasing as much information as possible to the
j American public.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Very well. Mr.
Harrelson, do have anything to add?

MR. HARRELSON: No.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Questions on the part
of the board? Dr. Joyce.

DR. JOYCE: Mr. Pereira, you mentioned
Jthac 50 percent of the microfilm appears to
duplicate “what already exists in hard copy. You
| mentioned the 201 file as an example of that.
Maybe I missed it, but could you
| characterize perhaps the portion that appears not

jtto be duplicated in hard copy? Do you have any

|

information about that?

MR. PEREIRA: The types of material that

isn’t duplicative?

DR. JOYCE: Yes.

MR. HARRELSON: This is where you get into
the 201 files which make up the bulk of the
microfilm, and it covers the areas of individuals

who were not -- or areas of their careers that were

not involved in the assassination period So,

there would not be documents from there in the hard
copy.

Most of the hard copy, apparently, was
created as the HSC staffers asked for particular
information. They would look at a file, and ask
for copies of it. The ultimate was one cable,
where we found 43 copies. So, most of it -- I
would say, every document is duplicated at least
ronce, and‘“used at multiple times throughout the
collection.

DR. JOYCE: And it would appear, then,
that most of the information within the 201 file --

MR. HARRELSON: The other area of unique
information is the Cuban exile activities. Much

a

more in the microfilm than in the hard copy.

collection. And most of that was released in
August ‘94.
CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Other questions?
MS. NELSON: How much have you been able
to look at this sequestered file? It’s enormous.
It boggles the mind, going through 72 reels of
microfilm. No wonder you printed hard copy. But I
would imagine you‘ve only done. some sampling.

MR. HARRELSON: With. the exception of the
201 file -- the duplicate microfilm 201 file and
the -- Well, that’s the only exception.-- We have
looked at every page of material.

MS. NELSON: Do you have a sense of what's
not, in your view, an assassination record?. Are
there certain percentages or certain numbers of

-hose? oe
Oe,

MR. PEREIRA: I think we need to defer to
the board on that. We’re suggesting certain --

MS. NELSON: Yes. That’s what --

MR. PEREIRA: -- questions that the board
may address, but we are deferring completely to you
,

in interpreting the law. And, so, we‘re assuming

that every piece of paper we have that was
| sequestered is potentially relevant. au

MS. NELSON: Under the ‘statute, we'll have
to see what that. is.

MR. PEREIRA: Yes, following the statute.

CHAIRMAN TUNHEIM: Any further questions?

DR. HALL: . John, do youl know what of these
materials the HSCA used and didn’t use?

MR. PEREIRA: There‘s a -- I‘11 let Barry
| comment on this, as well. There's a little bit of
uncertainty. To go back, every record that we made
| available to the committee is in the sequestered
collection.

Some of. the indications are that there was
ja very thorough review, obviously, by the committee
£ a lot of records. My impression is that, for
Sthoy eecois the committee staff requested
ertain files. We provided an entire file -- let‘s
say, on an individual.

But the committee staff may have said,
“Well, this really isn’t all that relevant to our

L-
fwork, but thank you. We now know who that person

is, because someone suggested this person may have
tbeen involved, and we needed to check that name."
And in. checking the name, we get the
| impression very quickly they determined they didn't
Have to read every single paper in the file. It's
that sort of breakdown, I think.
MR. HARRELSON: There are indications, as
you go through the microfilm, that some of the
|files were not reviewed. There is-a sheet for
these files signed by the staffers, and the
notations there. We have never -- Since we were
ere the file as a whole, we never went through
and calculated which one of these it indicated they
had reviewed or not.

DR. HALL: And was it the case, or were
there instances that you‘re aware of, where they

their names written on them -- different things.
MR. PEREIRA: But they seem to have made
very thorough notes on documents that they found +
jwere valuable.
DR. HALL: Did the CIA, in providing these
materials, put any restrictions on them with regard

MR.. PEREIRA: By the committee itself, you

mean?
- DR. HALL: Yes.
MR. PEREIRA: I.don‘’t know what the. record

MR. HARRELSON: They were held in one
central. location -- all notes -- for review. The

these files, makes their notes. And the notes

would then be reviewed by, -- at least, by a staff

MR. PEREIRA: There was an arrangement

whereby, if they wanted to use a record elsewhere

DR. HALL: I see.

MR. PEREIRA: But they could make the

arrangement to have them use the document.

DR. HALL: Congress has less than a’
distinguished history in handling some documents of
a classified nature, and there is this kind of
|problem. As document hunters, there's sort of an
interesting problem -- the extent of which, we get
unauthorized copying made; and then those documents
are out there somewhere else.

But that’s a side show to this. So, thank
eeu very much.
