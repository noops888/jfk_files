revealed that on 1 October 1963 Lee OSWALD had been in touch there
with Soviet Consul Valery KOSTIKOY about a telegram which the

hovever. This information, which comes in in great masses, had not
deen previously associated with OSWALD beeause his name ie not
actually mentioned in it, but the subject mtter shows it is about

votes of 1 Ostcber known to be OSWALD's.

4. This further technical information covers a roma-robin of
telephone calle and visits which OSWALD made to the Soviet and Cuban
Exbassies in Mexico City between 27 September and 3 October 1963.
This has been supplemented by reports on hig travel in and out of Mexico

Mexican Inmaigration Service records.

5. In brief, all this informstion shows that Lee Harvey OSWALD
entered Mexico (apparently by car) at Rueve Laredo on 26 September
1963, claiming he was a photographer, living in New Orleans and bound
for Mexico City. On 27 September he was in Mexico City phoning the
Soviet Embassy to ask for a visa so he could go to Gdessa, USSR. On
28 September, he was at the Cuban Exbassy, an@ Silvia DURAN, a Mexican
Employee of the Cuban Exbassy, telephoned the Soviet Enbassy about his

viea which would permit him and his wife to go on to the Soviet
Union. Silvia DURAN asked assurance that the Russians would grant
him the visa. A while later a Soviet official calls Silvia DURAN
back and explains that the vise applicant had been dealing with
the Soviet Consulate in Washington about the same matter and that
they could not be sure that he would ever get the Soviet visa.
The Soviet official added that the applicant had a letter showing
he belonged to an organization in favor of Cuba. Silvia DURAN and
the Soviet official agree to table the matter._

6. On 28 September 1963, OSWALD again visits the Cuban Embassy
end talks to Silvia DURAN about the same matter, and she phones the
Soviet Eubassy. OSWALD also talks te a Soviet official on her phone

apparently e forwarding address where he can be reached. There is
some hint this sddress may be in Cuba.

7. On 1 October, OSWALD has his phone conversation with Soviet
Consul. KOSTIKOV about his visa, and on the same day, OSWALD phones
the Soviet Military Attache about the same matter. The Military Attache
gives him the number of the Consul. Finally, on 3 October, OSWALD
phoned the Military Attache again and tried to talk about a visa, but
the Military Attache again referred him to the Consul and give him ®
the right phone number.
