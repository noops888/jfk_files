Attached is a memorandum setting forth full details

Jfk

relative to the story that appeared in the London Evening Stan-

aard on June 13, 1968, to the effect that "new and startling"

Intormation had

been reported to American officials by an uniden

tifled Arab Government concerning Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.

White House had previously made inquiry on June 13 concerning

chis release and a preliminary report was furnished the White

House that date showing that the allegation had no basis in

fact.

This story was authored by Jon, also known as John,

Kinche who has since been described by CIA as an unscrupulous

free lance journalist who apparently supports official Israell

Zionists lines in his work.

Kinche alleged that his source identified Sirhan as

having traveled to the Middle

East from the United States in

1964 and 1966, during the latter visit spending time in Calro,

Egypt.

It was reported that he allegedly married one Leila

Ussef Mikhael at Es Salt, Jordan, during another trip to the

Middle East on June 27, 1957.

Our investigation shows this to be entirely without

foundation since we can definitely show Sirhan to have been

either gainfully employed

y employee an ad

ts alleged to have been starta? school during the perlods he

Furthermore, Interview with

each of his brothers indicate Sirhan has not

left this country

since his arrival on Fare te, 1957.

JAN. 12,

The State Department, through its Embassy in London,

contacted Kimche in an effort to pin him down relative to this

story but he refused to identify his source and seemed unimpressed,

according to the state Department, by the possibility this might

be a simple case of mistaken, identity.

ACTION:

Attached for approval is a memorandum for the White

House, Vice President, and the Department setting Iorth Iull

relative to the
