Remyairtel 6/17/64.

Reairtel advised PH 672-C-TE has énecountered difficulty
in obtaining premises of 900 South 8th Street, Philadelphia, as
owner of this property does not want the address to be known
as a hangout. His efforts to date have been negative. He has
not been able to obtain the assistance of ANGELO BRUNO in this
regard due to BRUNO's recent trial, EDPA. Accordingly, PH
is discontinuing efforts at this time to establish technical
coverage at both 900 and 902 South 8th Street, Philadelphia.

If the opportunity arises at a later date, PH will again request
authority to establish coverage at these addresses.
