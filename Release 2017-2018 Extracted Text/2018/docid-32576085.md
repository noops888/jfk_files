Remyairtel 6/17/64.

Reairtel advised PH 672-C-TE has incountered difficulty

in obtaining premises of

owner of this property does not want the address to be known

as a hangout.

His efforts to date have been negative.

He has

not been able to obtain the assistance of ANGELO BRUNO in this

regard due to BRUNO's recent trial, EDPA. Accordingly, Ph

is discontinuing efforts at this time to establish technical

coverage at both 900 and 902 South 8th Street, Philadelphia.

If the opportunity arises at a later date, PH

will again request

authority to establish coverage at these addresses.
