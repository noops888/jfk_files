ANCLATTER-1; Query on Citizenship.

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

AR :

Please investigate status, take appropriate remedial steps

and advise.

REF: WAVE 9311, 14 July 1964

Prior to his current trip for training, AMCLATTER1

requested permission to make a stopover in raTAl on his return

to JUWAVE to inquire about the status of his citizenship.

offered Instead to have the matter looked into during his 'train-

ing course and then,

if there was anything his presence in

ZRIETAL could accomplish, to have arrangements made for appropriate

contacts.

To this end he submitted a memorandum outlining his

recollection of the history of his case. It is paraphrased in

sterile form below.

for approximately 16 months, I worked

in Identity A.

Before taking the appointment I consulted with

Identity B, who warned me that I was endangering my citizenship,

but also promised to help in case of trouble because I had offered

- to cooperate fully with ODEARL.

It so happened that I quickly

worked my

way up to the rank of Sergeant and was detailed to liaison

with ODYOKE agencies.

This facilitated my volunteering information

not normally given in liaison contacts,

and even my fulfilling of

requirements levied by them, particularly ODEARL and ODACID.

b. I believe that it must have been Identity C who

made the charge that deprived me of my citizership on the techni

cality that to have achieved my rank and position I must be

considered a PBRUVEN citizen.

Identity C and I had crossed

swords over a frf..d of mine

who had beer refused a PEPrIME visa.

Later Identity C was fired for having beed Involved in a visa

selling racket.

UFGA-16973

Ijentity B was very sympathetic and arranged to

have my suit for reinstatement take: by Identity D which handled

most ODYOKE legal business locally.

In 1951 Identity D referred

my case to a ZRISTAL law firm whose name I cannot recall exactly

but which initiated legislative action

¿ travelled to

ZRMETAL once,

to lobby on my own behalf, and was able to speak

with Identity E who promised to make a favorable recommendation.

Travel costs and other problems prevented my following up,

however, and nothing ever came of the bill as far as I know.

de

In 1959 Icentity D called me and told me that my

services would be needed again in view of the Communist tendencies

of the AMTHUG-] regime.

I agreed to cooperate without hesitation,

and was introduced to Identity F, KUBARK Chief of Station, who

assigned me to Isentity Go

Together we organized a group to

Infiltrate the PBRUMEN government.

I was evacuated to the JMAVE

area with my family in the fall of 1960, and was met by Identity

H.

the course of my relations with him and Identity I, I was

promised thot my citizenship status would be inquired into

officially, and that my service to KUBARK would resolve any doubts

that might have existed in the case.

In the summer of 1961g I decided in sheer desperation

to drive to ZRMETAL and to ask Identity. I for direct help in

citizenship matter.

My JMWAVE contacts, I explained, claimed that

there was no record of my quest for citizenship reinstatement.

Identity I sent someone to take notes on my case, and also intro

duced me to Identity & as my next supervisor in the JAVE area.

Identity J later advised me that my

file had been mislaid, hut

that the case was being reactivated.

In march 19oag cover business provided an opportunity

or me to leave the country long enough to re-enter with a

permanent residence visa.

At that time I was told by the Im

(ration officer (to my dismay) that my five-year waitin; perlod for

citizenship would begin on the date of my re-entry.

On another

cover trip in April 1963,

I met Identity K who said that he could

not believe that my citizenship had not been

reinstated by that

He said that he and Identity I had been given to understand

that 1t was all taken care of.

I wish to make the record clear that I have never

appliod for citizenship in any other country; that I did everything

posstble under the above circumstances to maintain my PEPRIV

citizenship; that I tried by every means avatlable to have my

citizenship reinstated after I learned that 1t had been takor from

me (without a hearing, by the way); and that the pertues passport

used in my evacuation was procured only after agsurances from

Idontity I that the action would not have an adverse eftect upon

attempts so reinstate my citizenship.

It would be appreciated 11 Hesdquarters could find some

way ol expeditire ANCIATIER-Is case.

Bringing this predicamont to

& satisfactory conclusion would relleve him of a personal dilemma

which might weigh heavily to the dotriment of his operational

effectiveness,

Any questions or instructions on the matter up until

20 August should ha

to ANCLATTYP-1 throush dio training

case silicer (note reference and provious correspondence ior tratu

site).
