The questioning goes as follows: "What instructions were

you given by Mr. Bissell at the meeting?"

Answer, from Mr. Halpern. "Mr. Bissell said that he had
recently, and he didn't specify the date or the time, he had
recently been chewed out in the Cabinet Room in the White House
by both the Prasident and the Attorney General for, as he put it,
sitting on his ass and not doing anything about getting rid of
Castro and the Castro regime,. ‘His orders to noth{ Pana
to me were to plan for. an:.operation to-accomplish that. end."

Then at page 36 and 37, Mr. Smothers returned to the same
Meeting. Mr. Smothers, at Page 37, asked the question of Mr.
Halpern as follows:

Question, "Let me ask you it another way. What was your
understanding of what Mr. Bissell had been told to do by the
President and the Attorney General?"

Answer, "To gat rid of Castro and the Castro regime on the

i
island of Cuba."

Now, in substance, did you have such a conversation with
Mr. Halpern?

Mr. Bissell. I assume his testimony is correct. I don't
happen to remember the meeting.

Mr. Schwarz... All right.

And did you have some conversation with the President and

the Attorney General in which they told you in effect, in

SUBJECT: *- Question “3 of 4 Questions Developed during ssc
‘ Hearing of Mr..Richard Bissell on 12 June 1975:

"A CIA ‘cable’ (OUT 51708, dated 1 May 1961)
contains a paragraph that certain informa-
tion from another cable or report was to
be withheld from the Department of State.
The Committee question is, What is it that
was to be withheld? Why? Was it actually
withheld and for how long?"

RESPONSE TO QUESTION 3:

This answer is based on our assumption that the

Committee's query concerns paragraph two, OUT 51708. |The

background is this. Consul General Dearborn had instructed ee lemmas!

the Chief of Station to determine from CIA whether or not

!
detailed information on plans of the dissidents to undertake !
i t

Fe the assassination of Trujillo which the Consul General had

acquired and reported to CIA (IN 44067, 30 April 1961) had
been given to the Department of State. CIA Headquarters

replied (OUT 51708) that the substantive intelligence .con-

cerning. the plans and identities of those who, according

to the report, Waiad participate had been passed to'the

Department ‘of’ Stadgpiion 1 May 1961."
. In its reply (out 51708) , CIA Headquarters appended

as paragraph two a query of its own. With parenthetical

.to permit easier understanding, it was:

The Chief of Station replied (IN 44957, 2 May 1961)

that Consul General Dearborn had informed him that

was aware of the presence in the Consulate of the

but that the Consul General, in a note sent via another

Consulate employee who was traveling to Washington at the

same time, had asked[—————SWYS tot: to talk about them to eo

2) authorized officials). The cable included the suggestion

that CIA Headquarters ask to plead ignorance if

asked about the presence of the and to refer

any inquiries in the Department of State to CIA,

The exchange evidently reflected the intent of Consul
General Dearborn - and CIA Headquarters - to limit -knowledge-

ment of SEatE UNE Gue re already aware. ‘It is noted that Mr.

as quickly as we can.

Mr. Smothers. Senator, we are now trying to track down

the other addressees on the 13 August memorandum. We have
|
heard from three of them, and one of them is the Ambassador to

Santo Domingo, and we are sending written interrogatories.
Another one, Mr. Wilson, is in today, and we have still another
one who is in South Carolina, and we will be talking with him.

After some further inquiry, it may be necessary, we will
probably have to make a decision whether we will need to. talk
to General Lansdale again. I believe we are already planning
for Mr. Maheu and if we are, we should certainly have that
picture clear in about another week.

The Chairman. Last night, Senator Tower and I met with
the leadership relative to the problem that the Committee faces
with finishing up its work on the assas$ination issue. It was

the strong feeling of the leadeershin that the Committee should

issue a united report and that we should make every effort to

in it. I could be wrong about that, but I am almost certain

that he was not.

Senator Schweiker. Mr. Chairman, I would like to read
the whole paragraph so that nobody accuses me of excerpting
part or parcel of the paragraph. It tells a package, but it
has some names I'd like to ask the witness about. It says,
“Whether or not the zealots received direct orders from the
President or the Attorney General, they did receive orders to
eliminate Castro from power in Cuba. The secret war was a
result of that eee and Castro's assassination, if not
specified, was a logical objective of that war «| Acting on the
President's authority,.JMWAVE trained several thousand Cubans
in geurrilla tactics, armed then with weapons and explosives
and sent them down to the Caribbean with hopes of glory. «All
of them sought to end Castro's hold on Cuba, and many of them

made attempts on Castro's life in the impromptu tradition in

the attack on the Laquina Hotel which is referred to above.

Mr. Dennin. - Now, in Paragraph 2 of the same memorandum,
it is stated that these arms would presumably be used against
key members of the Trujillo regime?

Mr. Bissell. That's right.

Mr. Dennin. That's the last sentence of Paragraph 2.

And you are aware, are you not, sir, that this memorandum was
concurred in by your Deputy-that would be at the time Mr. Helms,
where'tt says, concurred, Deputy Director of Plans? And from
your review of the IG report, I take it that you did not concur
in it, but that Mr. Helms did in your absence?~

Mr. Bissell. I believe that is the case. This copy
doesn't show it.

Mr. Dennin. We have requested, and I‘heard again on this
from Mr. Elder yesterday, that there is no copy extant which

would show who actually signed, on behalf of the Chief , Western

Hemisphere Division, and Ican ‘inform. you sir,.that. tied)
that was not again, according to the IG report, Colonel King,
but: apparently in his absence, his deputy, Pwas not
you as DDP, but it was your deputy who concurred in that, and
further that it was not the Director of Central Intelligence
which approved it, but his Deputy, at the time General Cabell.

Mr. Bissell. Right.

Mr. Dennin. Everybody was apparently out of town at that

particular point.

See that, sir?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I do. |

Mr. Dennin. Now let me point out a couple of things
raised in this memorandum. Once again there is very specific
discussion of assassination, a method of assassinating Mr.
Trujillo which is discussed as using a powerful bomb. A
further method is putting poison in Trujillo's food or alter-
natively in his medicine, and finally, possible methods of
delivering arms and materials to the dissidents are discussed.

Specifically at the end of that Paragraph 3 you will note that

(____} reports that @MDECK turned his attention away from arms *

and started talking about delivery of other types of materials,
exotic materials, powerful bombs,

Mr. Bissell. I am not finding that particular paragraph.

Mr. Dennin. Say the beginning of Paragraph 4. Let me
just read you the first sentence of Paragraph 4.

"ERBRCREA) said the object of obtaining this kind of help
anyway is the elimination of Trujillo and instead of using
arms or grenades, he began to speak of more exotic materials
and methods." And then it goes on to talk about the powerful
bomb that could be planted along the route of Trujillo's
evening walk.

Do you see that, sir?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I do.

Mr. Dennin. Would you agrze with me that there is no

question whatsoever that based upon this memorandum for the
record, if it accurately describes the conversation which the
Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division-3 participated, that
assassination was being discussed, that it was being discussed
in a very specific sense, and that it was made perfectly clear,
as the first sentence in Paragraph 4 indicates, that the purposd
to which the exotic materials sought by the dissidents would be

put was the assassination of Mr. Trujillo?

Mr. Bissell. I do.

Mr. pennin. Mould you feel that this memorandum would havd

come to your attention, either directly from or
from his immediate superior, Colonel King?

form of an outgoing cable or something of that|sort. C10) x

P SECRE | a
The Chairman. Why didn't you include that| in the memor-
andum?
Mr. Bisséll. I cannot tell you, Mr. ‘Chairman. I do not
remember what considerations moved me. I don't know whether
\

it was because this was common knowledge and it seemed to me

unnecessary to include it, or as you are implying, there was

an element of concealment here. I would be very surprised if
it were the latter, in this case. Cia A |
Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, if Counsel will yield? Since

I was originally asked to join Counsel to do work up on the

|
Trujillo program, and I think he knows this too, it appears in
the record before the Committee out of the '67 |Inspector
General's report and all of the cable traffic which was directed

from the Consul General to the State Department through the

CIA channels that this plan of the high explosive device was

transmitted to Consul General Dearborn,
promptly classified it as an insane idea, which, if they try
to-do this, because of the heavy guard, they're going to all
get themselves killed.

And it would appear to me that if that transpired before
the memorandum, the memorandum standing on itsj/own looks very
bad, but with this other information having been tranzmitted

back to the that it was a foolish plan, it

would appear that there was no plan that they thought was

workable in the United States government.
