The questioning goes as follows: "What instructions were

you given by Mr. Bissell at the meeting?"

Answer, from Mr. Halpern. "Mr. Bissell said that he had

recently, and he didn't specify the date or the time, he had

recently been chewed out in the Cabinet Room in the White House

by both the President and the Attorney General for, as he put it,

sitting on his ass and not doing anything about getting rid of

Castro and the Castro regime.. His orders to both!

and

to me were to plan for an operation to accomplish that end."

Then at page 36 and 37, Mr. Smothers returned to the same

meeting. Mr. Smothers, at page 37, asked the question of Mr.

Halpern as follows:

Question, "Let me ask you it another way. What was your

understanding of what Mr. Bissell had been told to do by the

President and the Attorney General?"

Answer, "To get rid of Castro and the Castro regime on the

island of Cuba."

Now, in substance, did you have such a conversation with

Mr. Halpern?

Mr. Bissell. I assume his testimony is correct. I don't

happen to remember the meeting.

Mr. Schwarz.. All right.

And did you have some conversation with the President and

the Attorney General in which they told you in effect, in

SUBJECT:

Question 3 of 4 Questions Developed during SSC

Hearing of MI. Richard Bissell on 12. June 1975:

"A CIA cabie (OUT 51708, dated I May 1961)

contains a paragraph that certain informa-

tion from another cable or report was to

be withheld from the Department of State.

The Committee question is, What is it that

was to be withheld?

Why?

Was it actually

withheld and for how long?"

RESPONSE TO QUESTION 3:

This answer is based on our assumption that the

Committee's query concerns paragraph tio, OUT 51708.

The

background is this. Consul General Dearborn had instructed

the Chief of Station to determine from CIA whether or not

detailed information on plans of the dissidents to undertake

the assassination of Trujillo which the Consul General had

acquired and reported to CIA (IN 44067, 30 April 1961) had

been given to the Department of State. CIA Headquarters.

replied (OUT 51708) that the substantive intelligence .con-

cerning the plans and identities of those who, according

to the report, woutd participate had been passed to the

Department of Stageron 1 May 1961.

In its reply (OUT 51708), CIA Headquarters appended

as paragraph two a query of its own. With parenthetical

The exchange evidently reflected

the intent of Consul

General Dearborn - and CIA Headquarters - to limit knowledge-

ment of State wu were already aware.. It is noted that Mr.

was in alal the target of tendentious regime-inspired

radio commentary in the Dominican Republic. Further allega-

tions could have impaired.his ability to serve in that

country.

a very

small item, but we should track it down.

If there are any other loose ends, let's tie them up just

as quickly as we can.

Mr. Smothers. Senator, we are now trying to track down

the other addressees on the 13 August memorandum. We have

heard from three of them, and one of them is the Ambassador to

Santo Domingo, and we are sending written interrogatories.

Another one, Mr. Wilson, is in today, and we have still another

one who is in South Carolina, and we will be talking with him.

After some further inquiry, it may be necessary, we will

probably have to make a decision whether we will need to talk

to General Lansdale again. I believe we are already planning

for Mr. Maheu and if we are, we should certainly have that

picture clear in about another week.

The Chairman. Last night, Senator Tower and I met with

the leadership relative to the problem that the Committee faces

with finishing up its work on the assassination issue. It was

the strong feeling of the leadership that the Committee should

issue a united report and that we should make every effort to

Mr. Bissell. I don't believe

in it. I could be wrong about that, but I am almost certain

that he was not.

Senator Schweiker. Mr. Chairman, I would like to read

the whole paragraph so that nobody accuses me of excerpting

part

or parcel of the paragraph. It tells a package, but it

has some names I'd like to ask the witness about. It says,

"Whether or not the zealots received direct orders from the

President or the Attorney General, they did receive orders

to

eliminate Castro from power in Cuba. The secret war was a

result of that policy, and Castro's assassination, if not

specified, was a logical objective of that war.

Acting on the

President's authority, JMWAVE trained several thousand Cubans

in geurrilla tactics, armed then with weapons and explosives

Mr. Dennin. • Now, in Paragraph 2 of the same memorandum,

it is stated that these arms would presumably be used against

key members of the Trujillo regime?

Mr. Bissell. That's right.

Mr. Dennin. That's the last sentence of Paragraph 2.

And you are aware, are you not, sir, that this memorandum was

concuried in by your deputy that would be at the time Mr. Helms,

where it says, concurred, Deputy Director of Plans? And from

your review of the IG report, I take it that you did not concur

in it, but that Mr. Helms did in your absence?

Mr. Bissell. I believe that is the case. This copy

doesn't show it.

Mr. Dennin. We have requested, and I heard again on this

from Mr. Elder yesterday, that there is no copy extant which

would show who actually signed, on behalf of the Chief, Western

Hemisphere Division, and I can 'inform you sir, that'":'

that was not again, according to the IG report, Colonel King,

but apparently in his absence, his deputy, Ms.

"was not

you as DDP, but it was

your deputy who concurred in that, and

further that it was not the Director of Central Intelligence

which approved it, but his Deputy, at the time General Cabell.

Mr. Bissell. Right.

Mr. Dennin. Everybody was apparently out of town at that

particular point.

see that, sir?

MI. Bissell. Yes, I do.

Mr. Dennin. Now let me point out a couple of things

raised in this memorandum. Once again there is very specific

discussion of assassination, a method of assassinating Mr.

Trujillo which is discussed as using a powerful bomb. A

further method is putting poison in Trujillo's food or alter-

natively in his medicine, and finally, possible methods of

delivering arms and materials to the dissidents are discussed.

Specifically at the end of

that Paragraph 3 you will note that

reports that EMPECK turned his attention away from arms

and started talking about delivery of other types of materials,

exotic materials, powerful bombs,

Mr. Bissell. I am not finding that particular paragraph.

Mr. Dennin. Say the beginning of Paragraph 4. Let me

just read you the first sentence of Paragraph 4.

"EMpack A, said the object of obtaining this kind of help

anyway is the elimination of Trujillo and instead of using

arms or grenades, he began to speak of more exotic materials

and methods." And then it goes on to talk about the powerful

bomb that could be planted along the route of Trujillo's

evening walk.

Do you see that, sir?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I do.

Mr. Dennin. Would you agrse with me that there is no

question whatsoever that based upon this memorandum for the

record, if it accurately describes the conversation which the

Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division-3 participated, that

assassination was being discussed, that it was being discussed

in a very specific sense, and that it was made perfectly clear,

as the first sentence in Paragraph 4 indicates, that the purpose

to which the exotic materials sought by the dissidents would be

put was the assassination of Mr. Trujillo?

Mr. Bissell. I do.

ME. Dennin. Xwould you feel that this mamorandum would have

come to your attention, either directly from Mr.

or

from his immediate superior, Colonel King?

Mr. Bissell. Us would guess this or a summary, and

conceivably it could have come to my attention,

again in the

form of an outgoing cable or something of that sort. (90) X

Mr. Dennin. Now having taken some time to go over this,

sit, and the reason I do, I would like you now to turn to and

consider the memorandum from you which is under Exhibit I

in the Senator's bill -- and Curt, you have in your book, on

top of that, the minutes of this Special Group meeting, on

February 14th, '61.

The Chairman. Why didn't you include that in the memor

andum?

A

Mr. Bissell. I cannot tell you, Mr. Chairman. I do not

remember what considerations moved me. I don't know whether

it was because this was common knowledge and it seemed to me

unnecessary to include it, or as you are implying, there was

an element of concealment here. I would be very surprised if

it were the latter, in this case. (103) A

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, if Counsel will yield? Since

I was originally asked to join Counsel to do work up on the

Trujillo program, and I think he knows this too, it appears in

the record before the Committee out of the '67 Inspector

General's report and all of the cable traffic which was directed

from the Consul General to the State Department through the

CIA channels. that this plan of the high explosive device was

transmitted to Consul General Dearborn, the Station Chief,

who

promptly classified it as an insane idea, which, if they try

to do this, because of the heavy guard, they're going to all

get themselves killed.

And it would appear to me that if that transpired before

the memorandum, the memorandum standing on its own looks very

bad, but with this other information having been tranzmitted

back to the

that it was a foolish plan, it

would appear that there was no plan that they thought was

workable in the United States government.

Mr. Dennin. Among other things, that advises - well,

that our position, our being the Agency, is that you should

attempt to avoid precipitous action by the intornal dissidents

to the opposition groups until headquarters, by that you mean

CIA headquarters, are better prepared to support assassination

and assassination is added in, I believe the original word is

the code, EMSLEW effect a

change in the regime and to cope

with the aftermath.

On page 2, it indicates that "Headquarters is prepared to

take the following actions:

as soon as the capability to receive those was developed". and it

it

was always the understanding and knowledge of Headquarters at

that time and specifically your understanding and knowledge when

you received and reviewed this cable, that those sought after

were to be used specifically in connection with

an assassination attempt on Trujillo, wasn't that so?

MI. Bissell. It probably was. I don't remember whether

there was any other use, possible use of tham, but I'm going

to let that stand. (107) B

Mr. Dennin. Well, going back to just those, there is no

doubt on that, to the document at Tab M, M as in Mary --

RESPONSE TO QUESTION 1:

No specific documentation to show that the Department
