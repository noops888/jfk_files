KDAFGHAN - Mexico City, Mexico ~ FI/CI Support Project
Targetted Against the Cuban Embausy in / Wo:

Purpose

KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides the Mexico
City Station with fixed photographic and physical surveillance
of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The
objectives of the project are to furnish photographie coverage
of the Cuban installation during daylight hours; ‘to assist
the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the
installation and to fulfill various requirements in support
of other Station Cuban operations.

Description

The KDAFGHAN Project continues to encompass two assets,
KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been associated with the
project since 1962. Both agents continue to furnish information
on a timely basis on the personalities and activities of the
Cuban target. A description of the individual assets is set

i 1

forth below:

a. KDAFGHAN-1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in
Mexico who left Cuba in 1960. He has “been the principal
agént of the KDAFGHAN Project since 1962, KDAFGHAN-1's
cover is that of a translator and would-be writer. Family
holdings from his deceased father also provide financial
backstopping, All photographic coverage of the main Embassy
gate through final printing and mounting is processed by
KDAFGHAN-1. ij

b. KDAFGHAN-2 (201-305604): KDAFGHAN-2 is the mother of
KDAFGHAN-1. Her cover is that of a dependent mother. KDAFGHAN
acts as KDAFGHAN-1's assistant and fill-in whenever he is away
from the basehouse.

Changes 4
eS \
The only major change during the Project year was the
-Anstallation of a:TV monitor/robot canern combination ‘during
October 1970, the month designated as “Cuban month." : This
jadded coverage contributed to the compilation of target
Studies on several Cuban officials, Paese studies will be
“used as a starting point for future operations, namely’ the
recruitment/defection of these officials.

Accomp) ishnents

\

A. The main value of the production of the KDAFGHAN
Project has been in establisning the pattern of various Cuban
Embassy employees. The monitoring hab also revealed which
automobiles: the various employees usually drive, Photographic
gad Lake Of the visitors to the main gate of the Cuban Embassy
and logs of the movement of Cuban Embassy personnel have proved
yery useful in ‘identifying new Cuban PCS employees in Mexico,
Normally the’ Station has been able to maten Moverents of new
and old employees during the initial period when duties and
contacts were being turned over to the now employees and so
identify theiy duties.’ KDAFGHAN has provided current photographs
of TOY and transiting Cuban offictals and Headquarters’ has
often provided positive identifications of these persons,
Norberto Hernandez, a DGI headquarters of ficer
visiting Mexico, was identificd in thia way, j

2. The Station utilizes KDAFGIAN Photographic coverage
and logs to verify the visits of Station assets to the Cuban

Embassy,

3. KDAFGHAN also provides coverage of what appears to
be Amorican visitors to the Cuban Embassy mata gate. In the
case of Americans who arrive in automobiles bearing U.S.
lleense plates, the license plate number, car d scription,
and sterile copies of, photographs are given to the Por for
jdentification, A significant result of the RDAPGHAS operation
gucluded a photographic of a specific individual | on old FBI
target - who had been seen visiting the Cuban installation.

4. KDAFGHAN also provided useful coverage for the
KDACOUSTIC.3 operation, an operation aimed at the recruitment
or defection of a DGI officer. This coverage enabled the
Station to determine KDACOUSTIC-3's movements, an inportant
factor in timing the calls and visits of our access agents,
This use of the. operation should prove extremely yaizable during
the coming year since a more Aggressive reeruitment Frogram
against ‘the Cuban target is planned,

SECRET


«KDAFGHAN-1° whe:

“Problems and Se urity : j

No agent control or operational problems have been
reported. “Neither were there any sccurity problems encountered
during ‘the period.’ Gerald D, FAHLANGER continues to be the
Case Officer ‘and hafdler of KDAFGHAN-1, FAHLANGER has met
and could continue: to meet KDAFGHAN-2 in an emergency, The
alternate Case Officer is Terence D. SISTONE who meets i
; FAHLANGER is not available, Both Case Officers
are known tothe assets in alias, and both mect KDAFGHAN-1
in a-safehouse. During February 1971 the safchouse was
changed-in compliance with normal operational security,
Meetings are generally held once a week. ‘More frequent
contact can be made. by telephone, In an emergency, anyone
can call KDAFGHAN-1 at his home and say they are a’ friend
of "Pepe Simon." KDAFGHAN-1 will reply "I haven't seen him
since last Christmas." KDAFGHAN-1 speaks English

Coordination:
The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the |
Cuban target in general, He has not been specifically briefed

on this operation,

Future Plans;

The Station is constantly examining the possibility of
gn audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy.
A successful audio device would serve, in most cases, to
identify the individuals who are photographed by KDARGHAN-1
since they normally identify themselves to the gate house
attendant. There are a few Station assets who have occasional
access to the gate house, and it is conccivable that one of
them could place a quick plant device, provided security
conditions are favorable, The Station currently has under
consideration a recruitment effort against a lower level
employee of thé Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous
help in such an operation,

LIONION - Mexico City, Mexico ~- FI/CI Support Project
Targotted Against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City. “FY 1971 Cost

Purpose:

The LIONION Project provides the Mexico City Station
with fixed, selective photographic and physical surveillance

=f the Cuban Embassy and Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. It

4s designed to provide information in support of Priority A,
paragraphs 2 and 4 of the current Operating Directive, that
is, the Cuban target present in-Mexico and the support
rendered by Cubans in Mexico to exile and other leftist
groups in Mexico,

Description: j

1. The LIONION Project currently encompasses two agents,
LIONION/1 and LIONION/2, 2-basehouse directly across from the
Cuban compound, and a safchouso for mectings with Station Case
Officers. The two agents furnish photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the main entrance to the Cuban Embassy. In
addition, on a spot basis, photographic coverage ‘and visual
surveillance of the Cuban Consulate entrance is possible. The
agents also act as dispatchers for the unilateral LIEMBRACE
surveillance team when the LIEMBRACE team is being \used
against Cuban target individuals. A description of the
individual assets is set forth below.

2. LIONION/1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in
Mexico who left ‘Cuba in 1960. He has been the principal agent
of the LIONION Project since 1962. LIONION/1's cover is that
of a translator and would-be writer, Family holdings in



-2-

Tampa, Florida, inherited from his deceased father also
«provide financial backstopping. LIONION/1 received. his
“immigrado" (permanent immigrant) status in 1965 and- now
shas a good deal of ,immunity from harassment from Mexican
immigration authorities. All photographic coverage of the
main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping, and
‘mounting “is processed by LIONION/1. LIONION/L and LIONION/2
maintain a log ‘which indicates when a photograph was taken,
and pertinent. identifying data. License numbers of cars
used by: various Cuban Embassy personnel are recorded as woll
As License numbers of cars of unidentified porsons visiting

the Cuban Embassy.

3. LIONION/2 (201-305604): Mother of LIONION/1. Her
cover is that of a dependent mother. As with LIONION/1, sho
has "immigrado" status and has heen associated with the
LIONION Project since 1962. LIONION/2 acts as LIONION/1's
assistant and £ill-in whenever.ho is away from tho LIONION

basehouse,

Changes:

During the project year, the pulse camera coverage of
the Cuban Consulate entrance was discontinued, Little or no
use was being made of the product from this camera. One
reason for limited use was that there was no real way to
readily fix the timo--or the day-- a particular photo was
taken. There were no other significant changes in the
project during FY 1970.

Accomplishment:

1. The LIONION production for FY 1970 consisted almost
entirely of photographic coverage of visitors to the Cuban
Embassy main entrance and of logs of the movement of Cuban
Embassy personnel and visitors. This proved very useful in
identifying new Cuban Embassy PCS cmployces in Mexico. The
monitoring also revealed which cars the various employees

usually drove.

2. LIONION also tock photographs of what appeared to
be American visitors to the Cuban Embassy front gate. In
the case of Americays who arrived in automobiles bearing
U.S. license. plates, the license plate numbers, car
descriptions, and sterile copies of photographs were given

to LNERGO for identification.



£

3.. Tho Station also used tho LIONION photographic
coverage and log. to. check on tho reports of Mexican and
other JKLANCE assets who claimed to have visited the Cuban
-Bobassy; In the case’ of some assets, LIONION/1 was givon
w photograph of the. agent and told to be particularly alert
at cortain times of certain days to confirm the agent's
entry and exit, This proved particularly useful in checking
AVDINE/L's story of contact with tho Cubans. It also con-
firmed LIRELIC/1's visit to the Cuban Embassy at an early
staxo ln Station recontact with LIRELIC/1.

Prob loms ¢.

1, No agent control or operational problems have been
reported, Noither were there any security problems
encountered during the period. LIONION/1 was met in a
safvhouso on an average of once por weck by Andrew E.
PELLEMENT, in alias, “Following PELLEMENT's doparture in
date May, Gerald .D. FAHLANGER took over the rosponsibility
for thy LIONION Project. FAHLANGER, in alias, meets LIONION/1
approximately once per week. In January 1970, the Station
had LIONION/1 change the safchouse used for mectings with
Station.officers, le signed a ono-year lease on the new
apartmont, in alias. LIONION/1 uses the apartment on weekends
and ovonings to lend credence to the cover story he usod in
ronting; i.e., that he lives out-of-town and maintains this
small apartment in Mexico City for use during his frequent
visit

2. Station visits to the LIONION baschouse were limited
to three during the reporting period. These were made during
non-daylight.hours, LIONION/1 picked up the Station officer
away vom the LIONION basehouse area and drove tho officer
te the ‘Ghouse in LIONION/L's own car. The basehouse hag
a driveway off the street entrance-way which facilitates
entry during non-daylight hours.

3. During the Project Year, the pulse camora and the
electronic equipment used with the LISAMPAN operations were
removed from the baschouse, thus reducing the amount of
compromising equipment in the basehouse.


Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the
Cuban target in general, He has not been specifically
briefed on this operation, :

Future Plans

= i. The ation is re-examining the various points of
viow which the LIONION baschouse provides of the Cuban
Embassy complex in ordor to determine what steps can be
taken to improve tho usefulness of the LIONION product.

For instance, from thu window in the room where the pulse
camera proviously was installed, un excellent view can be
had‘of the Cuban Embassy garden and the walkways between
the three Cuban Embassy buildings--as well as the Consulate.

“The Station plans’'to have LIONION/1, on a spot-check basis,

observe the garden area, In -this way, ‘the Station hopes to
update its information ow the locatiom of the various
otficers' offices, the .general pattorn of movement and
activity, ete, This area will ‘also be observed during the
night to soo if it can be determined which areas are being
used for living quarters ov offices.

2. It is also planned to assess LIONION/1's ability

to observe and draw appropriate conclusions from his obser-
vations, and to write these up for the Station,

3. Depending on the need for Consulate coverage, the
installation of closed circuit-TV coverage of the Consulate
entrance is boing considered.

4. The Station is being queried as to emer,

gency contact
arrangements with LIONION/1. fi

Costs:

1. General: This renewal request is for the period
1 July 1970 through 30 June 1971. (FY 1971), in the amount
of

2. Source of Fund: Project LIONION is included in

the Western Hemisphere Division's FY 1971 Operating Program
in the amount off f



ti
&

~S-

3. Project Budget: The following is a cost breakdown
for.the preceding, current and next fiscal years:

4. Foreign Currency: There is no need for foreign
currency which the Station cannet provide. There are no
non-JKLANCE funds involved in this project.

5. ‘Commitments: LIONION/Y and LIONION/2 receive, in
addition To their regular salary, the equivalent of one
month's salary as a Christmas bonus. LIONION/1 is reimbursed
for operational exponses related to the project. In the
event of termination, cach agent will receive thirly duys
actual notice,

6, Funding; All funds are passed by the case officers
during the safchouso meetings with LIONION/1 who receipts for
the funds on the spot. The amount of funds used under this
project are not enough to arouse the suspicion of LIONION/L
by the authorities should he be apprehended, He has suf-
ficient private income to cover the JKLANCE funds he receives.

7. Accounting: All funds are accounted and certified
for in accordance With JKLANCE regulations.

8. Annexes: None.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : LIONION Project Renewal Request

1. Approval is requested of the LIONION Project_for the
poriod 1 July 1969 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970). fo!
Funds are available. i

2. Project LIONION is a support project which “provides
the Mexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical
surveillance’of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.
The surveillance is conducted by two indigenous agents located
in 2 basehouse directly across from the Cuban compound. At
times the principal agent o acts as a dispatcher for the
LIEMBRACE surveillance team. Information is radioed to the
team concerning the departure of Cuban officials, thus allowing
the team to xemain a more discreet distance from the target.

: 3. As reflected in the attached Project Renewal. an
Audio device planted in the gatehouse of the compound could
be monitored at the LIONION basehouse, aiding greatly in
identifying visitor Since the-time the Station subzitted
the renewal, however, this device ceased to function along
With the rest of the LISAMPAN devices. This’ installation
was monitored through carricr current from the LISANPAN/
LISASU baschouse, also situated in front of the compound.
Since the connection between the two basehouses was by carrier
current only, and since the agents in each basehouse are un-
Qware of the other's activity, a possible compromise of the
LISAMPAN/LISASH activity should not affect LIONION security.

. 4. Although the LIONION Project does not produce dis-
Seminable positive intelligence, it is considered by the
Station as essential to its Cuban operations. The 4.100 or
nore selective individual photographs produced annually,



oy.

Couplod with the visiial observations, were effective in
Providing timely operational information. In addition, over
8,000 .foct of pulse camera film is produced annually, recording
“the Amigo of cach visitor to the Consulate. “The years of
experience of the principal agent have given him intimate
knowlodge of the target personalitics. ‘ile often brings matters
fo tho immediate attention. of the Station withoat having been
levied tho specific requirement to do so. Ass result, the
Station ts afded greatly in keeping abreast of the day to j
day activities of the Cuban compound.

5. in recent months, the LIONION Project was useful to
the Station in checking out statements made by ESMARROW-1,

GS. in March 1969, the Project provided photus-of three
U.S. citizens who visited the Cuban Embassy and wore suspected
or peing draft dodgers. The photos were passed to the Phy
within three hours of the request for information,

7. Other than the loss of the audio device in gatehouse,
there have been no changes. The operation continueate run
smoothly, :

8. Approval 1s recommended.

A. Objectives

° roject LIONION, 9 long-term nupport project designed to
providé fixed photograpbic, teciinical, and physical surveillance
of the PBRUME Embeesy and Conanlete in Mexicu City, haw the
following specific objectives:

a. To furnish photographic coverago during daylight
hours of the main entrances to the target inctallation,

b. To operate as a listening post in support of
technical operations agninst thie target to complement the
photogrephic coverage.

c. To redio dispatch physical surveillance teans
ageinst pereons useoclated with the target.

4, To aoaist the Station in compiling; information for
individual dossiers on officials of the target installation.

e. To fulfill various requirements in support of other
Station PRRUMEN operations.

2. The nbove-cited objectives are in agrecnent with the
over-all objectives of Station Kexico City.

Be. Changes

Oliver D. CIMOCH assumed administrative and operational
reavonsibility for Project LICNION in December 1967 and
continued this responsibility until his departure in December
1668. Pending arrival of CIiOCH's revlacement, the Project was
handled by Station Officer Gerald D. FAINLANGEX and Station WOACRE
representative, Walter W. CURMBURY. On 28 February 1969, LIONIOH-~1
was introduced to Andrew E. PELLEMENT, who assumed Project
responsibility effective that date.

C. Intelligence Production

As an operational supeort project, Project LIOMION does not
produce dissemirable positive. intelligence. Quantitatively,
during.CY 1968, the Project provided over 4,000 selective individual
photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering the target
instellation and over 8,0CO feet of pulse camera film, There hes

teen no formal audio product frem Project LICxIoK since July
1968 when the tranecription of the LISAMPAN/DM: traffic was
terminated. As reported extensively in HMMA. 36553, 19°...
February 1969, the Station has teen unable to activate LISAMPAN/

TON ‘product is discussed in paragraph ) telow. The Station

Headquarters. The. cost-of this portion of the operation ia
minimal, however, since it is.limited to the cost of the film.
and development at Eeadquarters. The camera works autovatically _

. aud requires only minimal maintensnce.

D. Effectiveness

1. Project LIOUION is considered by Station Mexico City as
essential to its PBRULEN operations, It has consistently proven
highly effective and responsive to Station reauiresents of both
long and short renge neture. LIO:I0N-1, the Project's only full
time agent, continues to furnish on a timely tasis, information
on the personalities and ectivities of the target personnel,
IIONIOW-2 continues to backstop LIONIOH-1 end substitute for bin
when he is away from his post. At the age of 70, she is not
able to man the LIOFICK base full time, and her sight is
failing. She is atle to photogreph. visitors, however, and live

PAK/DOG traffic. LIOKXION-2's role as a |
Ok-l insures continuous coverage of the target
during daylight hours, five days a week. LIOFION-l's more than
six years of experience working on the same target continue to
produce an increasingly complete and accurate identification of
the stati and visitors to LIkING. These years of experience have
developed an agent knowledgeable of WOFIRM operational and
security requirementa who will often bring to the Stetion's
attention those matters which he feels are of immediaté interest
without having special requirements levied.vpon him and without
waiting for the next regularly scheduled meeting with his
Station contact. He has on numerous occasions notified the
Station of the presence of suspect PRKUMEM security types. He
has slso frequently passed along operational leads of use to
the Station in other aspects of ite PHRUMEN operations.

2. The addition of LISANPAN/DOG to the LIONION besenouse
has noticeably increased LIONION-l's esbility to identify new
visitors to the target and at timee, determine the nature of
their business. The LISAMPAN/DOG product was channeled to the
LIOWION bssehouse by carrier current from Lisa? LISASH on
10 April 1968. Since its primary value is a aid to LIOhioN-2
in identifying LIRING visitors, its product has not been recorded

or transcrited since July 1968, LIONICK-1 live monitors the
treffic from his baschouse. LIGA! PAN-1 whe wans the LISASH
base has teen told nothing of the LICHION base and LIONIOX-1
- wes offered no explanation concerning the manner in which
LISAMPAN/DOG. production is channeled to him. Thus a possible
compromise of the LISADI basehouse, linked directly to LIRING,
would not compromise the LICL1Uk basehouse waich has no direct

link with the target.

3. Project LION1ON was of direct assistance to the Station
on-two separate occasions in recent months:

a. As aresult of information received on a priority
fx basis (the same day as requested) from LIOHION=1, the
Station was able to verify certain statements wade by
ESWARROW=1 concerning the locetion of LInING officials at
specific times. LIOIOK-1 reported the times at which
these officials ceme in and out of the LIRING compound and
provided a description of the clothes they vere weering at
the time, LIGNION~-1's information raised the possibility
that ES# OW-1 might at least teve been corfused in his
reporting of the times at wrich he met LIPING personnel,

etc.
b. In March 1969,  LIé tie] was able to provide

pictures of three ‘OLADY males, who, although unidentified,
fitted the general deecription and time frame furnished by

INERGO, The latter suspected that two or three “OLADY
draft dodgers might visit LIRING to orrange trevel: to
PBRUMGN. ‘The Station was able to furnish LNERGO.with
pictures of the three together with a report of their
arrival and departure from LIRING within three hours of
ile request for informution. Ad ion was
promptly forwarded to INURGO es it tecame available from
LIQWICEH-2. :

4. During the past year, Li0hI0-1 acted as a dispatcher
for the LIEPHEACE surveillence team on a number of occesions.
hy utilizing. his ventee point in the area of the target, he is
able to redio information to the L. RACE team on the arrival
end departure of LIRING officials thus allowing the team to
remain at s distsree from the target unseen hy possible, counter-_
surveillence from the target. The Station plens to use. LIONION-1

lessen the risk of exposure of the team to the PERU. IS.

decision can be made on that second gift until mid-1970,

E. Problems

‘BAKER was turned off for se i reasons on

16 January 1969 at 1345. hours. All sutsequent attempts to
reactiva'e it have teen unsuccessful, Headguartera was requested
to review ell availeble Station informaticn on this to decide
whether BAKER's atrupt end was the result of a compromise or
whether it was somehow connected with the installation of

TELEX equipment at LINING.

HMMA-33841,

The AMOTs have received and reviewed a number of the
prints from the LIONION operation and report that it
is a time-consuming and largely unproductive effort

The practical results of such a review, 1.c., the
identification of the greatest number of visitors to
LIRING, can be realized best through the widest cir-
culation of the’ prints among the AMOT staffers, con~
tacts, and informants. This practice would result
in wide knowledge of the existence mf the operation,
and in the expenditure of many.man-hours which, it
appears, could be more productively spent in other

pursuits.

The AMOT organization currently does not have either
the qualified personnel or available space and equip-
ment to process the film as suggested in paragraph
three of reference. Until they move into new quarters,

PROJECT LIONION RENEWAL REQUEST

A. Objectives:

1. Project LIONION is a long-term.support project designed
to provide fixed photographic, technical; and physical surveillance
of the P@RUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The specific
objectives are:

a, To furnish photographic coverage during the
daylight hours of the main entrances to the target
installations.

b: To matntain in readiness a listening post to
support technical operations against. the targets.

¢. To radio dispatch physical survelllance teams
against persons associated with the targets.

d. To provide for # mechanism which can fulfill
various miscellaneous PBKUMEN support requirements.

2. The above-cited objectives are in agreement with the over-
all objectives of Station Mexico City.

B. Changes:

In late January 1967 the operational and administrative
responsibilities for Project LIONION wore transferred from Howard A,
TRECKLEK to Cornelius L. PEUVION. No-agent handling, control, or
administrative problems were encountered during the past year,

Cc. Intelligence Production:

As noted in Section A above, Project LION{ON is an operational
support project and does not produce disseminable positive
intelligence. During the past year this project did provide over
5000 individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering
or leaving the target installations, aS well as approximately 8000
feet of pulse camera film. Information on the comings and goings
of target personnel and visitors to the installations, which
LIONION-1 provides in daily logs, has been incorporated into Station
files and on occasion made available to other stations or LNHARP
sencies, i.e., LNERGO. LION{ON has been particularly ‘useful in
spotting new employees whose photos are then passed to LITAMIL=7
for identification.



cede tee! ate dae ce

Figen,

D. Effectiveness:

1... Project LIONION 18 ‘considered by the Station to ve highly
effective ‘and essential. In addition to providing the valuable
photographic coverage citéd above, LIONION-1 continues to provide
interesting observations on the personalities and activities of
the personnel working in the targets, LIONION-1 reporting 18
being incorporated into the recruitment operations targeted against

“LIRING=2 ‘atid LIRING-16.

In early July LIONION-1 obtained and furnished a new safe
Apartment which is being used for sensitive or lengthly meetings
with LIRESORT-1 as well as ‘LIONION-1. The safe site has been
Stocked with a sufficient supply of food so as to allow two persons
to live there for at least three days in the event the Station
ever needs a cooling-off site for an agent or defector.

cpa, Throughout the past project year ‘LIONION-1 continued to |
function effectively as the radio dispatcher for the LIEMBRACE
freveillance Team. “Nuch of this effort was expended in estimating
the movement/tabit pattern of LIRING-2, a prercquisite for his

pending recruitment.

E. Problems:

1. On 27 June LIONION-1 was hospitalized for emergency
Surgery to treat a perforated ulcer. Since LIONION-2's presence
Cae teduived at the hospital during the operation and also through=
out the postoperative convalescence period, photographic coverage
was suspended until 10 July.

2. Other than a temporary postoperative morale slump on the

part of LIONION-1, there have been no significant personnel,
security, or administrative problems.

F, Liaison:
Not applicable to Project LIONION.
G. Interagency Coordination:
Not applicable to Project LIONION.

Hq. Plans:

1, The Station plans to continue to exploit LIONION-1's
experience, training, and location to provide the photographic
Coverage cited above. In addition, the Station plans to make more
extensive use of the operational lox books and personality
observations provided by LIONION-1 in support of an intensive

physical penetration ‘program.



sony eNom,

2. During the ensuing period, the Station plans to utilize
LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 as LP operators for a portion of the
LISAMPAN technical penetration operation, It is anticipated that
this additional tank will not be levied on LIONION-1 and LIONION-2

iB.

until after 1 January 196:
I. Costs:

1. For the past project year, 1 January through 31 December

19 t is estimated that the t roject cost will be about
It is approved forf P

2. For the renewal per t January through 31 December
1968, it is requested that be approved. This is broken

down as follows:

a. It should be noted that the operational loan made to
LIONION-2 to enable her to qualify for inmigrado status in Mexico
(see Cost Section of previous project renewal request) has been
completely repaid. The loan, which was placed in an escrow-type
fecount, was withdrawn in monthly. increments by LIONION-1 and
incorporated into his revolving fund. A detailed accounting was
iepared cach month by LIONION-1, a practice which will be continued
during the ensuing project year.

. MEMORANDUM FOR : Chief, WH Division
SUBJECT. 3 Renewal of Project LIONION

(Photographic/Technical Coverage
of Cuban Embassy in Mexico)

; +
ACTION REQUIRED: Approvals Requested Paragraphs One
and Four

1. Approval is requested to renew Project
LIONION for the period | January through 3L December

annual expenditure o ineluding
for FY 1967 andf for FY 1958, WH
for this activity for

Division programmed
FY 1967 and funds are—ava . The Project cost

has been increased by| over the previous year,
occasioned by a small monthly raise for the Principal
Agent and a new provision for miscellaneous operational

expenditures,

2. Although this two-man Project does not
produce positive intelligence, it contributes. sub-
stantially and directly to the coverage of the Cuban
Embassy and Consulate in Mexico, producing photographs
in bulk of persunnel und visitors as well as intorma-
tion on patterns of activity and personal associations,
And supporting recruitment attempts. It is contemplated
that the Project will afford support to the ‘extensive
technical penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LISAMPAN)
currently scheduled for installation in mid-January
1967, One of these penetrations is scheduled for the
Embassy gatehouse where visitors would normally
identify ‘themselves upon entering. Information from
the gatehouse is to be transmitted securely to the
LIONION basehiouse as well as to the LISAMPAN listening
post. By collating this and other LISAMPAN information
with the photography, it is hoped to be able to identify
photographically many of the, visitors to the Embassy.



3. The. physical security of the photo-basehouse
has been improved and the overall security of the
Project’ is considered to be satisfactory, i

“4. It will be noted that in February 1966 the
Station assisted LIONION-2, a Cuban citizen, to
qualify for Mexican immigrant status with a loan of
| which Was reduced ¢ as of
31 December 1966 at a reraynent rate of per
month. This loan is being protected by an appropriate
Memorandum of Trust. ‘Approval is requested to
continue this: arrangement until LIONION-2's inmigra
tion status is settled, estimated to occur by ;

30 November 1967.

C. Intelligence Production:

There are no other changes

The intelligence production 1s the sasie as that reported in the reneval

requeat for last year,

It ie difficule to estimate the intelligence value in

numbers of reports as there are so few positive reporta mide from this type of

production on the photographic end of the project.

But’ this photographic

coverage is of inestimable operational intelligence value in coverage of the

PBRUMEN target.

D, Effectiveness:

Should the LISAMPAN operation become active, part of LIONION’s
time will be used in support of ‘that operation,

The Station's estimate of the value of this project has not changed from

that expressed in the renewal request of last year.

LIONION has further es=

tablished ‘his importance to the Station's operational activities by demonstrating
hie ability to spot surveillance targets at LIRING from only a physical descrip~

tion provided by the Case Officer.

If the planned LISAMPAN activity gets underway,

LIONION observations and insight into activities of LIRING will be increased

greatly,

The apartment spotted by LIONION~1 and obtained by the Station across from
LIRING that was mentioned in last year's renewal request is scheduled to be

utilized in the LISAMPAN operation,

The location of LIONION-1 across from the

target and his background knowledge built up over the years are invaluable assets
to the Station's coverage of the prioary target of the Related Mission Directive.

EB. Problems;

_ There were no major problems during the-past year, one security problea
involved the claimed spotting of some of the photogrphic equipment from the
street by David M, WILSTED'(P), A thorough check of the basehouse by LIONION*1
and the Case Officet failed to reveal any such equipuent as being visible frow
he street. However, additional security measures vere taken by darkening the
. background inthe room:béhind: the equipment through hanging of heavier drapes
‘on the. window, “drapesoathe wall, and putting up a portable screen behind

the equipment... This also serve: @ security check against the prying eyes

of the houseliold servant’ as LIONION-1 can now open the door ‘fully to the room
when the servant pages him and she.cannot see the equipment, The other problea
-48 the obtaining of inmigrado status for LIONION-2. This involves the depositing
of funds to a bank account and is discussed under paragraph I,

F, Liaison:
There is no liaison involved in the project.
G. Interagency Coordination:
Not applicable,
a, Plans:

It is planned to have LIONION*1 keep special logs on the activities of
selected targets in LIRING as he has done over the past year, With the case
officer handling LIONION-1 directly on a weekly basis, it is planned to continue
picking his brains for additional details on the LIRING target. Hopefully
LIONION-1 and 2 will be utilized for assistance in covering the proposed take

from the LISAMPAN operation,

\
LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL

A. Current Objectives: This Project is a technical, currently

primarily photographic, surveillance operation against the Cuban
Embassy and Consulate ‘in Mexico City. Its original objectives,
still current, include furnishing photographic coverage during
daylight hours of the Embassy and Consulate entrances; furnishing
@ control point for. dispatching physical surveillance teams
against persons associated with the target; and furnishing
a listening post (LP) in readiness to monitor and record
~technical audio penetrations of the target. Two new cbjectives
added during the Project year include assisting Station Mexico
City to build up individual dossiers on target officials; and
affording an observation post for Station activities involving
direct contact with the target. These new objectives are in
consonance with Priority A, Objective 1 of the current Related
Mission Directive for Station Mexico City.

B. Changes: There have been no changes in personnel and none
are conterplated during the coming year, Meadquarters is
assuming the task of developing some of the film exposed

under this Project. LIONION-1's pay was increased per
month effective 15 March 1965,

C, Intelligence Production: The Project is not designed to
produce disscminable information. It produced thousands of
excellent photographs during the year which were shared with
Headquarters and Station JMWAVE. Information on the comings
and goings of target personnel and visitors to the target have
been incorporated into many Station files, principally. the
dossier files. No precise statistics are available, but at
least 100 exposures are made daily during target working hours,

D. Effectiveness: The Project is considered highly successful
and essential by the Staton, In addition to the excellent photo-
graphic coverage provided, LIONION-1, the Principal Agent, has
developed into a first-class asset for other operational duties,
The Project Basehouse was essential to mounting and monitoring
the Station's attempt at recruitment and subscquent harassment
of a sensitive target employee. The Case Officer in charge of
the attempt sat with LIONION-1 for several woeks observing the
movement pattern of the target employee, LIONION-1 manned one
of the radio dispatch posts used to control the physical

_ surveillance of the target employee while near the Baschouse.


&

Without the ‘Baschouse:and LIONION=1's expert knowledge of the

target personnel and activities, such an operation could not
have been mounted. The operation itself. was an attempt to
satisfy the top priority requirement laid’on Station Mexico City
by Headquarters. It’ is expected that future similar operations

will depend toa large extcht on the facilities provided by
this Project, z

Another very effective performance by LIONION-] was his
obtaining, by sharp observation and quick, intelligent and
Secure action, an apartment ina building directly across
the street from the target. The Station had been sceking
an apartment in this building for many years,

F.. Problems: The only problem currently besetting the Project
is the exceSsive work load on the Principal Agent. To alleviate
this, Headquarters is assuming the task of developing some of
the film produced by the Project.

Cover for LIONION-1 has ceased to be a problem. He has
received his permanent immigrant status and now has a good deal
of immunity from harassment from Mexican immigration authorities.
He was able to get his translator cover backstopped directly
eut of the Office of the President of Mexico and thus has a
strong protective security factor built inte it,

F. Liaison: The Project has no liaison connection. LIONION-1's
cover backstop with the Office of the President of Mexico is non.
operational.

G. Interagency Coordination: Not applicable.

H. Plans: It is planned to make better use of LIONION-1's
observations and operational logbooks during the ouming year
rather than to.settle for his excellent photographs alone.

It has been found that he can often supply valuable additional
information because of his "feel" for those persons who are
under constant observation from the Basehouse. He can- read
Significance into activity which might go unnoticed or be
misinterpreted by observers with less experience. He will
also be called upon fér assistance in future recruitment
operations similar to: the case mentioned in paragraph D
above. Several such operations are being contemplated for
calendar year 1966, tne period for which the Project renewal

is being requested,
