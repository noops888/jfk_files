MENORANDUM FOR: Chief, lestern Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT

: Project NDAFGHAN Termination

1.

¿ request for termination action is contained in

paragraph four, herein.

Project KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides

the Mexico City

Station with fixed photographic and physical

surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

The objectives of the project are to furnish photographic cov-

erage of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to

assist the Station in compiling dossiers on officials

of the

installation,

and to fulfill various requirements in support

of other. Station Cuban operations. The KDAFGHAN project

en-

compasses two assets, NDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been

associated with the project since 1962.

While this project may be of some value to the FBI

(FBI compares KDAFGHAN photographs with the photographs of

known leaders

of extrenist groups in the u.s.

photographs of persons who are subjects of identification

orders prepared on badly wanted fugitives in the U.S., it is

of little value, as presently constituted, to Mexico City

are other means of obtaining photographs of

PCS and TD) Cuban personnel. :

4.

In early 1972 the Station mounted a thorough CI review

of all Cuban operations in

an attempt to improve their overall

security.

Although KDAFGHAN-1 passed the SGSWIRL with no

apparent

deception, his Cuban exile status, the long period

of time he has been operating his OP site in close proximit

to the Cuban Erbassy,

and the

potential (perhaps imnediate)

• danger presented by his and KDAFGHAN-2's Cuban relatives made

it clear that the agents should be terminated.

In view lof the

aforementioned, as well as security considerations in the JMYAK

case, in/l requests approval to terminate this project effec-

tive

In order to

meet termination commitments,

project NDAFGHAN was amended on

30: June 1972 by DIRECTOR: 285255

in the amount of 59,000, incre ions the project's authorization

from $11,950. to $20,950

KDAFGHAN - Mexico City, Mexico - FI/CI Support Project

Targeted Against the Cuban Embassy ta'Moston Clev

Purpose

KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides the Mexico

Cits Station with fixed photographic and physical surveillance

of

the Cuban Embassy and Consulate In Mexico City.

The

objectives of the project are to furnish photographic coverage

of the Cuban installation during daylight hours,

to nssist

the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the

installation and to fulfill various requirements in support

of other Station Cuban operations.

Description

The KDAFGHAN Project continues to encompass two assets,

KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been associated with

the

project since 1962.

Both agents continue to turnish information

on a timely basis on the personalities and activities

of the

Cuban target. A description of the individual assets

1s sct

forth below:

n. KDAFGHAN-1 (201-288218) :

A Cuban lawyer in exile in

Mexico wno left Cuba in 1960.

He has been the principal

agent of the KDAFGiAN Project since 1962.

KDAFGHAN-1's

cover is that of a translator and would-ve writer.

holdings from his deceased father also provide financial

backstopping.

All photographic coverage of the main Embassy

gate through final printing and mounting is processed by

KDAFGHAN-1.

b. KDAFGHAN-2 (201-305604): KDAFGHAN-2 is the mother of

KDAFGHIN-1.

Her cover is that of a dependent nother.

KDAFGHAN - 2

acts as KDAFGHAN-l's assistant and fill-in whenever he is away

from the basehouse.

Changes

The only major change during the project reyr was the

Installation of a TV monitor/robot camera combiration during

October 1970, the month designated as

"Cuban month."; This

added coverage contributed to

the compilation of targot

studies on several Cuban officials.

Phese Studies will be

used as a starting point for future operations, nanely the

rocruitment/defection of these officials.

Accomplishments

1. The main value of the production of the KEAFGHAN

Project has

been in establisning the pattern of various Cuban

Embassy employees.

The monitoring hag also revealed which

automobiles the various employces usually drive.

Photographic

the visitors to the muin Rate of the Cuban Embassy

and logs of the movement of Cuban Embassy personnel have proved

very useful in identifying now Cuban PCS employees

in Mexico

Normally the Station has buen able to match movements of new

and old

esployees during the initial period when duties and

contacts were being turned over to the new employees and so

identify their dutles.

KDAFGILN has provided current photographs

of TDY and transiting Cuban officials and Headquarters has

often provided positive identifications of these persons.

Norberto Hernandez, a DGI headquarters officer

1191t1ng lexico, was identified In this way.

2. The Station utilizes KDAFGIAN photographic coverage

logs to verify the visits of Station assets to the

Cuban

Embassy.

3. KDAFGHAN also provides covernge of what appears to

be American

visitors to the Cuban Embassy main gate.

In the

caso of Americans who arrive in automobiles

bearing U.s.

license plates, the license plate number,

car description,

and storile copies of photographs are given to the fSt for

identification.

A significant

result of the KDAFGELY operation

included a photographic of a specific individual - ac old FBI

target - who had been seen visiting the Cuban installation.

KDAFGHAN also provided useful coverage for the

KDACOUSTIC-3 operation,

an operation aimed at the recruitment

or defection of a DGI officer®

This coverage enabled the

Station to determine KDACOUSTIC-3's movements, an inportant

factor in timing the calls and visits of our access agents.

This use of the operation should prove extremely valuable during

the coming year since a more aggressive recruitment program

against the Cuban target is planned.

Problems and Security

No agent control or operational problems have been

reported.

Neither were there any security problems encountered

during the period.

Gerald D. FAHLANGER

continues to be the

Case Officer and handler of KDAFGHAN-1.

FAHLANGER has met

and could continue to meet KDAFGHAN-2 in an emergency. The

alternate Case Officer is Terence D. SISTONE who meets

KDAFGHAN-I when FAILANGER is not available.

Both Case Officers

are known to the

assets in altas,

and both meet KDAFGHAN-1

in a Safehouse. During February 1971 the safehouse was

changed in compliance with normal operational security.

Meetings are generally held once a week.

KDAFGHAN-1 speaks English.

Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the

Cuban

target in general. He has not been specifically briefed

on this operation.

Future Plans:

The Station is constantly exanining the possibility of

an audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy®

A successful audio device would serve, in most cases,

identify the individuals who are photographed by KDAFGHAN-1

since they normally identify themselves to the gite house

attendant.

There are a few Station assets who have occasional

house, and it is conceivable that one of

place a quick

are favorable.

consideration i recruitment effort against a lower level

help in such an operation.

2. Project LIONION is a support project which provides

the Nexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical

surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

The surveillance is conducted by

two indigenous agents located

in : basehouse

directly across from the Cuban compound.

At

times the principal agent diso acts as a dispatcher for the

team.

Information is tadioed to the

tean concerning the departure of Cuban officials, thus allowing

the team to remain a more discreet distance from the target.

3.

As reflected in the attached Project Renewal, n

device planted in the gatehouse

the compound could

be monitored at the LIONION

basehouse, aiding greatly in

identifying visitors. Since the time

the Station submitted

the

renewal, hoverer, this device ceased to function along

with the rest of the LISANPAN devices.

This' installation

was monitored through carrier current

from the LISAMPAY/

LISASH baschouse. also situated in front of the compound.

Since the connection between

the two baschouses was by carrier

current only, and

since the agents

in each baschouse are

aware of the

other's

activity,

i possible compromise

LISAMPAN/LISASH activity should not affect LIONION security.

4.

Although the LIONION Project does not produce dis-

seminable positive intelligence,

it is considered by the

Station as essential to its Cuban

operations.

PROJECT LIONION

RENEWAL REQUEST

A. Objectives:

1.

Project LIONION 15 a long-term. support profect designed

to provide fixed photographic,

technical, and physical surveillance

of the PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The specific

objectives nro:

a .

To furnish photogiaphic covcrage during the

daylight hours of the main entrances to the target

Installations.

To maintain in readiness a listening post to

support technical opcrations against. the targets.

To l'adio dispatch physical survelllance teams

against persons associaled with

the targets.

To provide for & mechanism which can fulfill

various niscellancous PBRUMEN support requirements.

The above-cited objectives are in agrecuent with the over-

all objectives of Station Mexico CIty.

B. Changes:

In late January 1967 the operational and administrative

responsibilities for Project LIONION were transferred fron llowerd A.

TRICKLE to Cornelius L. PEUVION.

No. agent handling, control, of

administrative problems were encountered during the past year.

C. Intelligence Production:

As noted in Section A above, project LIONION is an operational

support projoct and does not, produce disseminable positive

Intelligence.

During the past ycar this project did provide over.

5000 individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering

or leaving the target installations,

as well as approximately 8000

feet of pulse camera film.

Information

of target personnel and visitors to the installations, which

LIONION-1 provides in daily logs,

has been Incorporated into Station

and on occasion made available to other stations or LNHARP

agencies, i.c., LNERGO.

LIONION has been particularly userul in

spotting new employees whose photos

are then passed to LITANIL-?

for identitication.

D. Effcctiveness:

1. PrOJeCt LIONION is considered by the Station to be highly

effective and essentlal..

In addition to providing the valuable

photographic coverage cited above, LIONION-I continues to provide

Interesting observations on the personalities and activities of

the personnel working in the targets.

LIONION-1 reporting is

being incorporated into the recrultment operations targoted against

LIRING=? and

LIRING-16.

In early July LIONION-l obtained and furnished a new safe

apartment which is beiny used for sensitive or lengthly

with LIRESORT-1 as

well as LIONION-l.

The safe site has been

stocked with a sufficient supply of food so as to allow two persons

to live there

for at least three days in the event the Station

ever needs a coollng-off site for an agent or defector.

Throughout the past project year LIONION-I continued to .

function.effectively as the radio dispatcher for the LIElBRACE

Surveillaice Team.

Much of this effort was expended in estimating

the movement/ habit pattern of LIRING-2, a prerequisite for his

pending recruitment.

E. Problems:

1. On 27 June LIONION-I was hospitalized for emergency

surgery to

treat a perforated ulcer.

Since LIONION-2's presence

was

requiled at the hospital durin

the operation and also through

out the postoperative convalescence period, photographic coverage

was

suspended until 10 July.

2.

Other than a temporary postopcrative morale slump on the

part of LIONIOr-1, there have

been no significant personnel,

security, or administrative problems.

F. Liaison:

Not applicable to Project LIONION.

G.

Interagency Coordination:

Not applicable to Project LIONION.

H. Plans:

1.

The Station plans to continue to exploit LIONION-l's

experience, training, and location to provide the photographic

coverige cited above.

In addition, the Station plans to make more

extensive use of the

operational log books and personality

obscrvations provided by LIONION-l in support of an intensive

physical penetration program.

account,

occasioned by a small

monthly raise for the Principal

Agent and a new provision for miscellancous operational

expenditures.

2. Although this two-man Project does not

produce positive intelligence, it contributes.sub

stantially and directly to the coverage of the Cuban

Embassy and Consulate in Mexico, producing photographs

in bulk of personel and visitors as well as iniorma-

tion on patterns of activity and personal associations,

and supporting recruitment attempts.

It is contemplated

that the Project will afford support to the extensive

technical penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LISAJPAN)

currently scheduled for installation in mid-January

1967 .

One of

these ponetrations

is scheduled for the

Embassy gatehouse where visitors

would normally

identify themselves upon entering.

the gatehouse is to

be transmitted securely to the

"LIONION baselinuse as well as

to the LISANPAN listening

By collating this and other LISANPAN intormation

photographically many of the visitors to the Embassy.

It do difficult to estimate the Intelligence value in

numbers of reporte as there are so few positive reports made from this type of

production on the photographic end of the project.

But this photographic

PBRUMEN target.

Should the LISAMPAN operation become active, part of LIONIoN'e

D. Effectiveness:

The Station's estimate of the value of this project has not changed from

that expressed in the renewal request of last year.

E. Problems:

There were no major problems

during the past year.

One security problea

involved the

clatoed spotting of some of the photogaphic equipment from the

street by David M. WILSTED (P). A thorough check of the basehouse by LIONION*l

and the Case Officer

talled to reveal any such equipsent as being visible fron

the street. However, auditional security measures were taken by darkentag the

background

in the room behind the equipment through hanging of heavier drapes

on the window;

drapes on the wall, and putting up a portable screen behind

che equipment. This also serves as a security check against the prying eyes

of the household servant as LIONION-l can now open the door fully to the room

when the servant pages him and she cannot see the equipment.

The other problem

lo the obtaining of inmigrado status

fOr LIONION-2.

This involves the depositing

of funds to a bank account and ta discussed under paragraph I.

F. Liaison:

There is no liaison involved in the project.

Co Interagency Coordination:

• Not applicable.

H. Plans:

It is planned to have LIONION*I keep special logs on

the accivities of

selected targets in LIRING as he has done over the past ycar. With the case

officer handling LIONION-l directly on a weekly basis, it is planned to continue

picking his brains for addicional details on the LIRING target. Hopefully

LIONION] and 2 will be utilized for assistance in covering the proposed take

from the LISAMPAN operation.

I. Costs:

other Station aggers.

Objectives 4 and S are additiong to those objectives set forch in che

original project outline.

B.

Changed. There have been no changer in personnel and none are contem-

plated in the coming year.

It 18 being proposed in separate correspondence that

LIONION-L'a pay was Increased 40 dollars a nonth effective 15 March 1965.

C.

Intelligence Production. The operation has produced thousands of excellent

photographs, many of which are shared with Headquarters and Station IMWAVE.

Infor

mation on the comings and goings of target permonnel and visitors to the carget

Installation has

been incorporated into many Station files (primarily personally

files - Individual

It ha's been very heavy.

Scacion JWAVE shouid perhaps be called upon for an

independent evaluation of LIONION production it has recrived.

esseutial by the Station.

In addicion in excellent photographic coverege provided

by the LIONION agents, the station. has füund in LIONION-l a first clasg asset for

other operational duties.

was invited to appear for confrontation outside the Erassy. Wichout the LIONION

base and the expert kncwledge of LIONION-l of target personnel and activicles,

such an operation as LIRIS could

not have been rounted. It night be noted

this operation was an accerge to satlify the top priority requirement laid on

Scätion Mexico by Headquarters. It le expected that additional similar operation

will depend to a large extent on the facilitles provided by the LIONION operation.

Another very effective performance by LIONIONal was his obtaining - by

sharp observacion and quick, intelligent, secure accion -an apartment la

bullding directly across the atreet from

the target Echassy, The Station had been

sasking an apartuent in this bullding for mny years.

E. Problema.

The problem of cover for LIONION-I sorked out well during the

year to the poine where

It ceased being a problem.

By living hia cover as a trans-

lator he was enabladto bulld in atrong self protection when called upon to do some

cranolations for the office of che president of Mexico.

Toward the end of the year,

LIONION-l received the coveted status of "Inmigrado" which confers a great deal of

Inmunity from harrassment by Mexican authoritleo.

The only problen now besetting the project is LIONION-l's excessive work

load. An indicated above, an attempt la being made to alleviate chia load.

ш:E350д.

The operation has no Ilalson connection. LIONION-l's connection

with the Mexicau Presidency is non-operational.

G. Interasency Cecilination. Not applicable.

H. Ilans.

It la planned

to nake better use of LiesIoN-l'a observations

NENORANDUM FOR: WII/EXQ

SUBJECT

LIONION Project

1.

LIONION Is a new project which is submitted in the

amount of $10,478.

This is a photographic surveillance opera-

tion targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Moxico City.

TwO

ngents are involved; LIONION-l, a young Cuban lawyer in exilo,

and LIoNION-2, his nother.

The agchts act as observers and

photographers.

LIONION-1 Is also used as a dispatcher for the

LI EMBRACE

surveillance tean, from which he is compritmented,

to covet individuals associated with this target.

These ngents

were previously

used in connection with the unfinteral tele

phone

tap

operation against the Cuban Embassy.

The current

photographic

operntion began in the latter part of 1962,

and was

previously funded under Cuban FI funds.

The operation

has provided valuable data for the identification of Cuban

Embassy personnel and visitors, and on their patterns of

action and personal associations.

2.

The

security of this operation, particularly the

agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements,

appear reasonably sound.

Both agents know that they are

working for AlS, and LIONION-1 was successfully FLUTTERED

in October 1963.

However, LITANIL-T and LITANIL-9, who ae

penetrations of the

Embassy, are aware of this

activity, as they are used to help identify individuals

photographed.

Approval for the LIONION Project is recommended.

It 1s requested

that, in order to assist Headquarters'

evaluation, project reporting include details of CI/CE data

furnished, and examples of leads developed from such information.
