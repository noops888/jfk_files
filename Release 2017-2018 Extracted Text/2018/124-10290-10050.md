Several plans of action were discussed at the

meeting and it was also brought out that a master plan

was needed for the orgenization.

that

acts-of violence would be committed in the U. S.,

and this group would make it appear chat Castro Agents

From Cuba are

involved, thus creating ill feelings between

the U. S.

and Cuba.

Another plan discussed was the

renting of several apartments in various parts of the l. S.

Including Los Angeles and New York. Anti-CASTRO Cubans

playing the role of Castro Agents

could draw attention

to these apartments by

being very loud and carrying

packages

in and out of

the apartments to make chem appear

suspicious

When they felt they had attracted attention

they would

mention names of several dignitaries so that

these names would find their way back tothe FBI and

create investigative confusion in the FBI.

Another plan discussed was the blowing ap

of every lighthouse in the Bahamas between the U..S.

and Cuba.

Another plan mentioned was for the organization

to "rip off" drug pushers.

The above plans were merely

discussed in generalities.

HIRAM GONZALEZ was very concerned about security

Other organizations so that in ettect various organizatas

The mission failed because

MM T-2 was told that öne small boat was a "Formula"

and the small boats departed from the Key West, Florida area.

As armament, these boats had a twenty millimeter cannon and

a fifty caliber machine gun.

faced with all this, we are founding the Cuban Anti-Communist

In this battle, we will not respect "sancturaries"
