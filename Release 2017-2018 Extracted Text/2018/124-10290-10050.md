Several plans of action were discussed at the
meeting and it was also brought out that a master plan
was needed for the organization, One plan discussed was
that acta of violence would be committed in the U, 8.5
and this group would make it appear that Gastro Agents
from Cuba are involved, thus creating ill feelings between
the U. S. and Cuba, Another plan discussed was the :
venting of several apartments in various parts of the U. $.
including Los Angeles and New York. Anti-CASTRO Cubans
playing the role of Castro Agents could draw attention
to these apartments by being very loud and carrying
packages in and out of the apartments to make them appear
suspicious. When they felt they had attracted attanttan
they would mention names of several dignitaries so that
these names would find their'way back tothe FBI and
create investigative confusion in the FBI.

\ Another plan discussed was the blowing wp

of every lighthouse in the Bahamas between the U.S.

H aud Cuba. Another plan mentioned was for the organization
to “rip eff" drug pushers. ‘The above plans were merely

ciscussed in generalities,
| HIRAM GONZALEZ was very concerned about. see rity
of Liga Anti-Comunista’ Cubana. Members of LACC are not to

mention that they belong to this organization. The way
this organization is to be run is to get small groups
together to discuss plans and never to have large meetings.
They feel LACC should infiltrate Alpha 66, an anti~ :
ilitant organization with headquarters in Miami, ar
other organizations so that im effect various organizat has
would be cory ous LACC plans. This infiltration would
take approximately 8 - 9 months to be put into’ operation.

MM T-2, on July 15, 1975, advised that six persons

in the Bahamas or the shooting of ships trading with Cuba.

The persons involved left the Florida area about two weeks

ago and were gone several days. They used two small speed
boats and a "mother ship". The persons who went on the mission
were FRANK CASTRO of the FLNC, RAMON OROSCO ,HECTOR CABRERA,
RAFAEL TORRES, a member of (HECTOR DURAN’ s\group » and two u
unidentified boat. mechanics. The mission failed because

of some unexplained difficulty in making a rendezvous with

the mother ship.

MM T-2 was told that one small boat was a "Formula"
and the small boats departed from the Key West, Florida area.
As armament, these boats had a twenty millimeter cannon and
a fifty caliber machine gun.

| |
| ! MM T-3 said that on July 11, 1975, JUAN PEREZ

‘ FRANCO, President of Brigade 2506, said that FRANK CASTRO
and others went on a naval mission recently with two fast
boats and a mother boat. PEREZ FRANCO said Brigade 2506
was involved in this mision. According to PEREZ FRANCO,

| a ship trading with Cuba was going to be attacked near

Cuba. The mission failed as due to some difficulty the

small boats were unable to meet the mother ship.

Brigade 2506 is an association of members of
Brigade 2506, which took part in the Bay of Pigs invasion
of Cuba in 1961.

The following is a translation, by Miami :

and spiritual values of Western culture, using infiltration,
guerrilla warefare,’ murder and kidnapping, to draw in the
circle and get to the nerve center of the world, the
‘American continent, and thus eliminate our way of life--
faced with all this, we are founding the Cuban Anti-Communist
League (L.A.C.C.), to destroy the perverse plans of Soviet
Russia and CASTRO Communism in the Western Hemisphere.

In this battle, we will not respect “sancturaries"
since Communism, with its lack & scruples, recognizes no
frontiers which limit their destructive activities.

Our purpose is to put an end to Communism, in
@der to rescue our country from the claws of the Communists,
and to help preserve liberty for the brother nations ot

The officers are SALVADOR DIAZ VERSON, President, RAFAEL
PEREZ DORESTE, Secretary, ISRAEL SOTO BARROSO, Director of

and CARLOS R. PEREIRA, Director of Finance. According to
the source, he was told by PEREZ DORESTE during the past
PEREZ DORESTE, Ei

Z, formed the League because

people are hesitant to cooperate with the FLNC

because of fear that they will become involved with

the FBI, and because of the alleged infiltration by drug
pushers into the FLNC. PEREZ DORESTE, therefore, got the
above-listed officers (of the League) to help him because these
particular persons are well respected throughout the Cuban
community, whose reputations are untarnished. All the
officers are well known to the source with the exception

of PEREIRA, who according to PEREZ DORESTE, is in charge

of all finances for the FLNC. PEREZ DORESTE is to sell
bonds through the League, again because of resistance

on the part of the Cuban community in Miami to the FLNC.
