• has no illusions about permarent change.

F - Say Garrison gots a11 his convictions and it turns ort that hich men in the CIA are

do you think is going to happent Certainly there's sont kird of "powor vacuun" left.

I. - Woll wo are prosently residing in a totalitarian siste ard the fact that thera

might be a power vacuum doesn't frighten me.

That would be a massive improvement

ovor what, we have at the present time. I don't see Prosidont Johnson fleeing to Sweden.

I don't thinis that will be the result and I don't thine that what takes place in new

Orleans in terns of the trial will have that iind of shocking effect upon tha

American people.

Firstly becauso they probably won't even know about it since they

have to roly upon tho media for tho faces and the media has noù proved to ba too re11-

able in this area for the last 42 years.

Walter Cronkite in stentorian tones will make some roference to Southern justice. So

I think that what is taking placo here will never bo accurately reportod just as.

has beon tiring place here for nors than the last year has been distorted by iBe, CBs,

New York Times, Time magazine and most of all Newsreok, the liberal publication.

I think that ons cannot expoct that the facts which are presented at the Shaw trial

w1li be genuinely broadcast arour the country.

P - Explain to me what Garrison 1s talking about when he talks about an operational

level, an intermodiato level, ani then the sponsor levol.

I - I've rocently intorviewed a porson closely assoclated with the ClA for & rumber

of years.

I've talled with hin about the assassination of the president and he said it

fits into tho classic pattorn of program for "executiva action" and which.ar in-

telligence agency in the United States on abroad would have used to bring about the

operation.

He says the footprints of an intelligence operation are all over Daaley

Plaza. He describes it as at ons end of the chari there is a sponsor; chat is the ran

or organization who vants the joo done.

At the other and of the chart is the tarrot;

the target is the objective the sponsor mants to achievo.

It may be the blowine up

of a bridgo or tha sabotaging ot a ship or assassamsiing a head of state. It may be

going into an embassy and renoving documents, photorraphing them and returnine them.

In the latter case the objectiva is never to let anyone inor the job has been planned

or has been done. Fowever whon it comes to bloring up a bridge or killina a presi

dent, it is of courso impossiblo to prevent knowledge that the job has been done and

then it is most important io pretent aryone fron inuring uno the real sponsoi is.

The chain can

the chain.

I asked him what was insant by that and he said you kill him.

There are a

serios of

false sponsors that are also escablished so chat in case amone is curious,

which the Warren Corndssion was not, thoy will fird false loads. So if the Comm-

ission had examinod the evidenco closely ani lound thore was a conspiracy ard vera

they curious enough to fird out tho might have been bahird the conspiracy they would

have uncovered many false leads which vero scattored acourd Dealoy Plaza live leaves

For example they rould have fourd oui that Jack Ruby was associated

with organized crine.

There would have been irdications that Castro was irvolved

In the assassination.

For instance Oswald was planing possibly to go to lica after

the assassination.

Thore are a tholo host of clues that point in various diractions

the extrono right, extrome loft, organized erime.

These are just three examples of

tho cluas that were developed but it never got that far bocause the Commission baing

a liberal boay decided that it had no concern with the brith and that it would

compromise.

True libaralism.

The Cormission decided it would compromise because

those who planned the assassinscion envisioned pianos taking off the next mornin

to bomb China or Cuba or Russiu or hopsfuily all three.

The Presideri didn't want

that to happen and the Commission mas established to conceal the jacis and in con-

cealing the lacts, thoy also corcealed any oviderce oi a conspiracy includin the

things that dismsys me, that while one would expect attacks from the right, one would

expect the left to have a more sophisticated view, a knowledgeable view of what takes

On April 22, 1969, Sheriff FRANK CLINE, DeSoto

County Sheriff's Office, Arcadia, Florida, advised a Special

Agent of the FBI that he has recently received information

indicating that MARK LANE, a white male, age 42, has

recently been

in the Arcadia, Florida, area trying to stir

up trouble and

agitate the Negro population of

DeSoto

County against Sheriff CLINE. According to CLINE, LANE is

the author of the book Rush to Judgment, and LANE has also

recently authored an article for Playboy Magazine concerning

the recent murder trial of JAMES RICHARDSON, who was convicted

in July, 1968, in DeSoto County, Florida, for the murder of

his seven children by poisoning.

LANE has recently been

working closely with attorney JOHN ROBINSON, Flagler Beach,

Florida, who was RICHARDSON's defense attorney at the murder

trial.

LANE and ROBINSON have indicated in numerous news

articles that they have developed additional evidence

indicating RICHARDSON's innocence. Sheriff CLINE feels that

LANE's recent efforts to agitate among the Negro residents of

DeSoto County have been connected with LANE's efforts to

obtain publicity concerning the RICHARDSON case, and thereby

gain additional financing through LANE's articles and a book

which LANE reportedly is planning to write about

the

RICHARDSON case.

LANE has recently been traveling with a

white

female, known to CLINE as CAROLYN MUGAR, in MUGAR's blue

1967 Volvo station wagon, bearing Massachusetts license

137-018. MUGAR and LANE have recently been residing in a

Jakeside cottage at Flagler Beach, Florida, which is owned

by attorney JOHN ROBINSON.

On April 29, 1969, CEORGE LANE, JR. and

VIRGINIA LANE, 565 Retta Esplanade, Punta Gorda, Florida,

telephone 639-3928, personally contacted

a Special Agent

of the FBI at the sarasota, florida, Resident Agency. LANE

stated that he and his wife are independent reporters,

working principally for the United Press International and

for the St. Petersburg Times of St. Petersburg, Florida.

LANE stated that he and his wife had covered the

JAMES RICHARDSON murder trial in Arcadia, Florida, during

1968, and have been preparing a manuscript with the in-

tention of publishing a book about the RICHARDSON murder

, case.

On March 28, 1969, LANE was telephonically

contacted by one MARK LANE, who is in no way related to

GEORGE LANE, and MARK LANE indicated that he was aware that

GEORGE LANE was preparing to publish a book on the

RICHARDSON case.

MARK LANE stated he wanted to get

together with GEORGE LANE in order to read their files and

manuscript about the RICHARDSON case. An appointment was

made, and MARK LANE met with Mr. and

Mrs. GEORGE LANE at

their office, 207 Tamiami Trail, Punta Corda, Florida, at

When MARK LANE appeared for this

meeting, he was accompanied by his girl friend, CAROLYN MUGAR,

a white female, age approximately 22 years, 5'7" tall,

At this meeting, MARK LANE made numerous probing

inquiries concerning GEORGE LANE's knowledge of the

RICHARDSON case, and appeared to be seeking additional

witnesses who might be able to assist in exonerating

RICHARDSON. During the course of conversation, MARK LANE

stated that he has

been in the Arcadia, Florida, area

talking to the residents of the Negro section of the town

and trying to stir up trouble against Sheriff FRANK CLINE

of DeSoto County, Florida. MARK LANE expressed a great

deal of animosity toward Sheriff SLINE, and indicated he

does not understand how the people of DeSoto County have

allowed him to remain as Sheriff. MARK LANE indicated that

he intends to continue trying to stir up the Negro residents

of DeSoto County against Sheriff CLINE.

MARK LANE also inquired about GEORGE LANE'S

knowledge of any "underprivileged Indians" who might be

residing in the Immokalee, Florida, area.

From this

inquiry, GEORGE LANE understands or believes that MARK LAND

is trying, or will be trying in the near future, to agitate

trouble in the Immokalee, Florida, area, based on alleged

discrimination against the Seminole Indians who reside in

that area.

MARK LANE advised GEORGE LANE that he and

Miss MUGAR are presently staying at Flagler Beach, Florida,

at a cabin owned by attorneys JOHN ROBINSON and RICHARD WHITSON,

who represented JAMES RICHARDSON at his murder trial and are

still representing RICHARDSON trying to get him a new trial.

GEORGE LANE noted

that JOHN ROBINSON is a Negro attorney. He

stated he believes WHITSON is also a Negro.

MARK LANE stated that he and Miss MUGAR ara

presently traveling extensively throughout the southeastern

part of the United States, frequently visiting New Orleans,

Louisiana, as well as going to Boston, Massachusetts,

occasionally. They also go to Immokalee and Miami, Florida,

on occasion.

They apparently travel in the volvo station

wagon, according

to GEORGE LANE.

GEORGE LANE stated that it was his distinct

impression from his contact with MARK LANE that MARK LANE

is an agitator who is interested in stirring up racial

disturbances, particularly in the Arcadia and Immokalee,

Florida, areas. GEORGE LANE stated he has brought the above

information to the attention of DeSoto County Sheriff

FRANK CLINE, Arcadia, Florida.

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that during

their meeting with MARK LANE and CAROLYN MUGAR, they

received the very definite impression that MARK LANE

and

MUCAR are romantically involved, although MUCAR appears

much younger than MARK LANE. MUGAR appears to be a "wild,

'hippie'".

she assists MARK LANE as a photographer.

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that besides the

interest which MARK LANE and MUGAR evidenced in the

RICHARDSON case, they also appeared very interested in any

trouble spots in Florida, such as Negro unrest and

mistreatment of Indians.

On October 29, 1969, a confidential source abroad

dvised that during the month of October, 1969, an organization

The Communist-front organization "International

Association of Democratic Lawyers" (IADL) held its 8th Congress

in Budapest during the period March 30-April 3, 1964,

attended inter alia by a delegation from the Danish

Section

of the IADL. One of the delegates was a Copenhagen lawyer

named JORGEN JACOBSEN, who, prior to the Congress, had

collected some material concerning the assassination of

President KENNEDY. This material was to be used for a

draft resolution to the effect that the Congress was to

advocate unbiased

inquiries into the circumstances surroun-

ding the assassination and the sequel to it.

At the Congress, JORGEN JACOBSEN met the American

lawyer MARK LANE, who in his capacity of chairman of the

"Citizens' Committee of Inquiry" was working on an

independent inquiry into the murder, having

no confidence in

the material prepared by the Dallas

Police.

Between JORGEN JACOBSEN and MARK LANE

cooperation

was established on this draft resolution, which, incidentally,

was adopted by the Congress.

This cooperation was developed

further, and led to the establishment in Denmark of a so-

called

"Mark Lane Committee" for the purpose of collecting

all available information on the assassination of the

Prostent and informing the rubic of am bushed-up os

suppressed details concerning the murder.

Following the congress, however, MARK LANE himself

went to Denmark, where, in the "Lawyers'. Debating Club,"

the

"Students' Association" in Copenhagen, and the "Students'

Society" in Arhus, he told about his inquiries so far, aiming

at proving that reactionary, lascist circles were behind the

assassination of President KENNEDY. (5/

considered as long since dissolved, comprised a total of 16

The work of the American authorities on the

report of

In connection with the references of the Danish

press to this matter, in November, 1964, the "Berlingske

Tidende" published an article, the contents of which MARK LANE

considered defamatory.

The result was a libel action against

the newspaper, and on November 11, 1965, the High Court found

this case JORGEN JACOBSEN acted as counsel

for MARK LANE.

In 1966, MARK LANE, who in the meantime had

married a Dane and temporarily settled in Denmark, published

a book entitled Rush to Judgment, the substance of which is

that the murder of the President was not the work of a single

individual, but a conspiracy. Based on this book, a

documentary film was subsequently produced. Moreover, in

the course of the years since the assassination, MARK LANE

gave a great number of lectures about his inquiries and his

opinion of the events in Dallas on November 22: 1963. 5)

noted between him and Danish deserters' committees.

In

July, 1968, however, an IDL meeting took place in Grenoble,

France; an item on the agenda of this meeting concerned the

legal basis of refusing to take part in wars of aggression.

The identities of the participants of this meeting are not

refuse parti

known, but the fact that the IADl dealt with the subject and

that the two former IADL delegates are personally acquainted

and associated with this Communist front organization seems

to indicate that, some time or other, the idea arose between

them to bring American deserters to Denmark in order to

confront the authorities of a NATO country with a concrete

request for political asylum for American deserters.

(S)

The case of the two deserter American soldiers,

TED PRICE and REGINALD ALDERTON, which caused

so much

comment in the press, should undoubtedly be regarded in the

light of this. Escorted by MARK LANE, PRICE and ALDERTON

deserters, and he added that he had filmed the whole trip

the sequence of events up until then for the purpose of

this hearing

Eventually, the hearing got underway before

During the preliminary

phases of the hearing, MARK LANE argued with the commissioner

relative to his representing TONDA at this hearing because

Commissioner BRUCE allowed LANE to represent Miss FONDA.

The defense for FONDA moved to have the charges

this was why

she was stopped and checked by the United States Customs

Service on November 3, 1970. LANE also tried to bring

out that the vials, pills, capsules, etc. that FONDA had

in her possession were medicine which would not be checked

for an ordinary United States citizen, but, because

FONDA's name was on this list, she was

charged with bringing

these pills into the United States.

In regard to the assault charge against FONDA,

JAMES HENRY, as both of these veterans could relate data con-

cerning atrocities and massacres they had personally witnessed

while in Vietnam.

these individuals could be located.

LANe condemned the training being given to American

nilitary personnel prior

He claimed that United States recruits are summarily punished

if they refer to Vietnamese,

by any other term other than

either North or South Vietnamese,

"sookss;

LANE claimed that these military personnel receive rote

training in chanting over and over more than 100 times daily,

"kill, kili, kill.

MARK LANE claimed that there has been "a silent

mutiny" going on among United States troops in Vietnam for

somewhat over six months. He stated that enlisted personnel

during

which they pool sums of money, usually from S150 to $300,

to be paid out as a bounty for the G.I. who kills his command-

ing officer during the next military engagement in the jungles

When LANE was asked what he felt should be done

about American service personnel who are currently being

held prisoner in North Vietnam, he responded that he was

glad the question had been asked. LANE stated that Americans

who are concerned about brutalization of United States

prisoners abroad should immediately demand full investigation

"Idaho Daily Statesman, " Boise, Idaho, quoted wing Commander

During the summer of 1971, MARK LANE visited Paris,

France, while on his way to Italy. LANE was believed to be en

Lotta Continua, an Italian Marxist-Leninist group, which was

The source stated that

LANE currently heads

"Helping Hand," a servicemen's underground newspaper in Utah

which is directed

toward personnel of an Air Force base in

that state.

LANE indicated that he is very encouraged by the

response "Helping Hand" has received, and stated that he hoped

to convince the servicemen on the base to sabotage their work,

which, according to LANE, is very specialized and consists in

part of helping lay out bomb runs in South Vietnam. As an

example of a method of sabotage, LANE proposed altering the

bomb run layouts by glacing pencil marks slightly off their

correct positions.

III. MISCELLANEOUS

In the February 9, 1968 issue of the litica Daily

Press, a Utica, New York daily newspaper, on page seventeen

was an article

entitled "Lane Says CIA Had Part In Plotting

JFK's Death." The article read as follows:

"Hamilton--Facts in a pending New Orleans

trial will

startle and

shock' Americans over

FBI-CIA and other government collusion in

President Kennedy's assassination, controversial

Warren report critic Mark Lane said last night.

"Speaking to more than 425 in the Colgate

University Chapel, Lane lashed at coveruns and

lies, calling them

'hallmarks' of a total-state.

He was interrupted

repeatedly by prolonged

applause and encouraging laughter.

"He said the facts would come out in the

conspiracy trial, likely before April, of Clay

Belshaw, a prominent New Orleans executive.

"Lane praised

efforts

of New Orleans

District Attorney Jim Carrison. Lane, a former

New York City assemblyman, is now on farrison's

staff as special counsel investigator.

"He wound up a lecture tour with his

Colgate address and was to head back

to the

southern city.

" 'I predict Americans will be startled

and shocked

to learn

the ClA (central intelligence

Agency participated in planning the assassination

of the President and that the FBI (Federal Bureau

of Investigation) knew about it five days in ad-

vance and no one told the President,' he said.

"He pictured Lee Harvey Oswald, whom the

Warren Commission called the only assassin, as

an FBI pawn

who informed that agency about the

plot November, 1963, five days before it happened.

"Lane said the FBI

sent telegrams

to its

southern offices the night of November 17,

saying that an attempt would be made on Kennedy's

life in Dallas, Texas--Where in fact Kennedy was

slain on Now. 22.

" 'Jet, President Kennedy', he said, 'was

told, in October that the same group was

planning

to assassinate him in Chicago and he cancelled that

trip.'

"The death motive, he said, could be traced

to Kennedy's withdrawals of 1, 500 men from

Vietnam two months before his

death and

another

1,500 men shortly before he was killed. That

left a total of 15,500. It is now over a half

million men. '

"He said he didn't know why the Kennedy

family had remained silent.

He said the voters

should ask this

of New York Sen. Robert F.

Kennedy, the late President's brother.

"He said Jack Ruby, Oswald's killer, was

afraid to talk in Texas

and that Chief Justice

Earl Warren refused Ruby's plea to tell you

everytling I know', in Washington D. C.

"He said Oswald's widow, Marine Porter,

testified yesterday before a

New Orleans grand

jury. He

said her answers would be 'very

illuminating'.

"Lane said the government and news media

have tried hard

to stop the New Orleans trial.

He said the FBI

tried

to prevent publication of

his 1966 best selling book 'Rush to Judgement'.

"He said FBI assistant director John Roche

it.

"Lane refused to say if Communists were

behind the assassination. Somewhat cryptically,

he said, 'philosophically the shots came from

the right, not the left.'

"Nearing 41 and coughing fron a cold, Lane

"He said five shots were fired, ine from in

front of the president's slow moving car, and

two from behind and another that missed ricocheted

into a spectator's face.

"Lane said a photo showed Oswald standing

in the doorway of the Texas School Depository

Building as Kennedy's car passed, and not on the

sixth floor from where the fatal

shots allegedly

were fired. He said the warren group cut out this

evidence.

"Lane ridiculed Warren Commission members,

the government and news media. He scorned

for a recent TV show about the Garrison-Belshaw

case, for 'false statements, statements out of

context, and bits and pieces. NBC is much aware
