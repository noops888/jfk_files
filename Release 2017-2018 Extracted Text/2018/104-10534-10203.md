INTRODUCTION

The following summary and analysis is not intended to be
all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi=
zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished
by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO. To attempt to do so would be repetitious
and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the
formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of
primary concern.

This summary will not contain a detailed psychological
assesement of NOSENKO nor will it contain a recitation of the numerous

theories which have been promulzated in the past concerning varying

aspects of the NOSENKO case, This summary will de primarily
directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or wae not
* dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively
plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in -
a reassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO
has admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that

these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance

ULOUL0G7

Be



&

e@

but not to mislead this Agency in any material matters of an operational

or policy nature.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding of the phrase "bona

fides"! 2 considered in thi

summary, NOSENKO will be judged primarily
on whets:» be voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB kno.viedge,
and whether his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this
Agency were known to the KGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent
aspects will be considered, but his admitted previous errors, lies and
exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a
“uuna fide" defector.

There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement
against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or
correlatec to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer. For
purposes of thié analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas

considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may differ in regard to

whether this arbitrary standard is a completely accurate standard, but it
is felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from other
sources derived througi independent investigation will permit tae reader
to assess the information in toto against any standard he considers
appropriate.

The previous summary on NOSENKO entitled, "The Exami-

nation of the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector," has been considered in

.O CASE

SINCE 39 OCT

ER 1967

Since 30 October 1967, interviews with Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

have been conducted by one individual not previously known personally to
NOSENKO but who has been aware of the NOSENKO case since June 1962.
Interviews have been detailed and very extensive in scope, have

been recorded and transcribed, and have covered the entire life and caree.

of NOSENKO without regard to whether a particular aspect had been
covered during previous interview or interviews,

NOS:

(, although naturally apprehensive during the firet few
interviews, has been cooperative, has developed a relaxed attitude, and
the interviewer has noted no significant reluctance to discuss any aspect
of his life, career, or activities. On occasion NOSENKO has indicated a
reluctance to make positive statements in certain areas previously
considered at a minimum extremely controversial. This reluctance

was understandable and when it became apparent to NOSENKO that the

interviewer would not dispute cr disparage his statements without adequate
reason, this reluctance on the part of NOSENKO, in the opinion of the
interviewer, totaily disappeared.

During the interviewing period, particularly in the first 6ix montas,

MOSENKO materially assisted

¢ interviewer by preparing approximately
sixty memoranda on such diverse subjects as his life, motivation for de-
fection, individual cases, notes which he furnished to CIA in 1964, KGB
organization, and KGB officer and agent personalities, As an example

of the scope of this work by NOSENKO, four of the memoranda included
remarks concerning approximately 875 KGB officers, 100 KGB agents,

35 GRU officers, and 400 other Soviet nationals. These lists were alpna-
beticaliy arranged and the above indicated cooperation of NOSENKO hae
materiaily assisted in the organization and evaluation of information

furnished by him curing current interviews.

Copies of transcripts of interviews with NOSE

KO and related
memoranda have been disseminated to the FBI and the CI Stafi. Special
Agent Elbert Turner and Special Agent James Wooten of the Washington
Field Office/FBI in particular have given great assistance in research
and compilation of new or additional information and the FBI has inter-
viewed or reinterviewed a number of United States citizens concerning

whom NOSENKO has furnished pertinent information,

In addition, throe profesrionals from the SB Division have
reviewed the current information and ceeisted in the retrieval of
previous information from NOSENKO and collation of current
tnfermetion with previous tnformath-1. The latter is a tremendous
task because of the volume of materisl; the nuniber of individual
ceases i-volwed; and the extensive information in regard to KGB
persoasiities, precedures, organizational structure end activities.

The 85 Diviston elso provided the services of an expert
translstor to trensiste the tapes of the 1965 interrogation of NOZENK?
by Petr DERYABIN and one cf the previously mentioned three pro~
fessionals completed a new tranelation of the 1962 interviews with
NOSENKO. In addition, transcriptions of certain cther particularly
pertinent previous interviews of NOSEWK have bean completed by
the Office of Security.

Approximately 7000 pages of tranecripts and related material
have boen comptled and disseminsted since late October 1967. Com-~-
ments concerning the value of the tnformation contained in the ebove
materiel are contained fn another section of this eurmmary. As of the
present thne, & complotc anslyeis io not possible since @ considereble

‘The polygraph interview of NOSENK was initiated on

questions of a pertinent nature were included in the polygraph tater-

ANALYTICAL COMMEN

TS CONCERNING THE BONA FIDES

YURIY IVANOVICH NOSENKO

As indicated in the utroduciion to this summary, injormation in

regard to Yuriy ivanovich NOSENO will be considered against an arbi-~

trary but realistic list of areas considered =-rtinent to the question of
whether NOSENKO voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB
knowledge, and whether hie 1962 and early 1964 contacts with represen: -

atives of this Agency were known to the KGB.

It was noted that m

vation and certain other pertinent aspects

would aiso be considered but that his admitted previous lies and exag-

gerations would not per se warrant 4 conclusion that NOSENKO is not a
"bona fice defector."

The following is a iist of the areas considered pertinent and which
are being given specific consideration, Attached is a separate section
containing remars in regard to the designated areas of A - H.

A, Is NOSENKO identical to the person wnom he claims

to be?

B. Is the claimed HGB career of NOSENKO plausible?

- GuUL022



13-00000

ns:

est DR:

¢

Has NOSENKO given an acceptable expianation of
his motivation in contacting CLA in 1962 and for his
cefection in 1964?

is the information furnished by NOSENKO to CIA

concerning KGB operations, personalities, and organi-
zation reasonably commensurate with his claimed KGB
career?

Can the information furnished by NOSENKO be con-
sidered in toto as having resulted in material damage
to the KGB and/or has the information furnished by
NOSENKO been of significant benefit to Western Intelli-
gence?

Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in
information furnished by NOSENKO which would warrant
@ conclusion that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB?

is there evidence of a political or any other type objective

which could justify a dispatch of NOSENXO by the KGB
with permission to speak freely to CIA concerning his
knowledge of the KGB and without NOSENKO being given

a specific mission or missions?



13-00000

H. Is there an; evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO
in 1962 or in 1964 with CIA were known to the KGB
prior to his defection or that NOSENKO was ever briefed
by the KGB relative to his behavior or KGB objectives

during these contacts or aiter his defection?

13-00000

A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person

om he claims to be?

During interviews NOSENKO has {urnisaed detaiieé information in regard
to his family, his activities as a youth, the schoois he attended, assoc-
iates of his father and raother, and his own associates. The period
under consideration in this section is the period preceding his entry

into the First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-
March 1953.

Information furnished by NOSENKO concerning his father and
mother and his early iife, together with other information such as a
comparison of photographs of NOSENKO and a photograph of nis father
and confirmed travel of his mother to Western Europe in 1956 with
Madame KOSYGINA, conclusively establish that he is Yuriy Ivanovich
NOSENKO, the son of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, the Minister of Ship-
building in the USSR prior to his death in 1956. This is also satisiactorily
supported by personal-type information furnished oy NOSENKO concern-
ing other Associates of his father and mother.

Since, as indicated above, there is considered to be no doubt

that Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO is the son of the former Minister of

Shipbuilding, a detailed study of his life prior to 1945 (age 18) is of

le or no value in assessing the bona fides or non-bona fides of

se of his youthiul inciscretions, of which he has

admitted a number, is of no insport in a discussion of whether NCSENKO

was or was not Gispatched by the KGB, Obtaining any coilatera:

hand informa

nin regard io NOSENKO beiore 1945 would be of

negligible value, but there actually is supporting information from
Nikolay ARTAMONOV, a defector irom the Sovict Navy, concerning
the claimed attendance by NOSENXO at a military-naval preparatory

school in Leningrad,

NOSENKO, during current interviews, has stated that he grad-

~

uated from the Institute of International Relations in 1950 and had
attended the Institute since 1945. He has explained that he shoud nave
graduated in 1949 since it was a four-year course, but failed the éinal
examination in Marxism and therefore was required to attend the institute
for a longer period of time anc again take his final examinations.

Based on information furnished by NOSENKO concerning co-
students and the Institute, there is no reason to doubt that he actually
attended and gracuated from the Institute of International Relatiors in
1950. The previous controversy in this matter was camplicated by

NOSED

KO who, in 1964 after nis defection, stated in a biography that

he had graduated from the Institute in 1949. Actually this statement

: 01027



13-00000

by NOSENKO in 1964 resulted in conflicting information since NOSENKO
on 9 June 1962 during his first contact with CIA had stated that he
“completed the Institute of International Relations in 1950.‘ NOSENKO

has given the explanation that he changed the date of his graduation to

1949 because he did not wish to admit that he had failed to graduate in
1949, NOSENKO explained that this change in his date of graduation
caused him to pre-date kis actual entry into Navy Intelligence to 1950
instead of 1951 and his actual entry into the KGB from 1953 to 1952.

The above action by NOSENKO is included in what NOSENKO has
characterized as hie “stupid blunders." The latter is a rather apt
characterization of his now admitted lies and exaggerations but is not
evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. It is evidence of
a certain personality trait of NOSENKO who has in the past by his own
admission tended to enhance his importance and astuteness by graphically
portraying his personal participation in KGB activities concerning which
he had knowiedge but did not personally participate. ’

The claimed service of NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence during
March 1951 to early 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas has been

seriously questioned in the past. Specific comments on this period of

6004028
SECRET



13-00000

porerenet

time are contained in a separate section of this summary, but it is
considered that the recent interviews of NOSENKO satisfactorily sub-
stantiate his claimed service in Navy Intelligence during March 1951
to early 1953.

Attached is a typed copy of a handwritten memorandwn completed
by NOSENKO on 31 October 1967. This is a biographical statement con-
cerning his iife and KGB career, No effort has been made to correct
grammatical errors or spelling since to do 80 would be in conflict with
the manner in which current interviews were conducted; namely, to give
NOSENKO an opportunity to recuunt his life and activities to permit a re-
examination of the entire case, The comprehension and fluency of
NOSENKO in the English language was adequate for interview purposes

in October 1967 and both have materially improved since that time,

ini

ews of and memoranda prepared by NOSENKO since

31 Octoder 1967 have not indicated any material discrepancies with the
statements of NOSENO in the attached memorandum, One change that
has been niade by NOSENKO is that he now dates his transfer from the
First Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, to the Seventh
Department, SCD, as occurring in the latter part of May 1955 rather

than June - July 1955 as indicated in the attached statement. NOSENKO

also now dates the period in which an unsatisfactory "characterization"

1955 rather than May - June 1955, Since the unsatisfactory personnci

neither of the above changes are considered to be of a significant nature,

An effort has been made during current interviews to differentiate between

All cadets of this school were sent to forest (about 200 km.

In nummer 1945 there was created the institute of the inter-
national relations in Moscow and in July I entered in this institute.

In - uly my father went in Germany with the group of engineers
and he took me (I received a ternporary rank of a eenior lieutenant,

documents and a uniform).

In 1945-1950 I studied at the institute. In 1946 I acq
with a girl - Snicixov FLAVIA, student of the inedicine insisvuce. 1
wae in close rv: !.one with this girl, because of the pregnancy i married
her and she mace an abort, My parents were against the marriage and

we did not live together and we soon divorced, In the end of 1946 I was

acquai nted with Telegin AUGUSTINE and was going to marry her, re=

ceived a fiat in 1947 (St, Mira - former Ist Uecyehckad, 162/174}. In

- November her father, Generai TELEGIN, was arrested, but I married

her. The marriage was not successiul. I foundout about her close
relations with the brother, and the child-giri was born with pathological
changes. Iwas not the father of this child, After that I broke with her
and we were living separately (end of 1948 - beginning 1949).

In spring 1950 before state exams in the institute wae working

the commission, which was deal ing with future works of the students of

my 5th course, I expressed a wish to work in any military organization

of State Security), But MGB did not accept me. After that with the
help of the father I began to deal with the personnel department of the
intelligence of the ministry of military navy concerning my future work,

Passing state exams I failed Marxism-Leninism and with a
group of fails I wae passing state exams once more, In October 1950
I finished the institute and reecived a diploma.

1 was accepted in the navy intelligence in the 13 of March 1951
and in March 17 went by a train to Soviet Harbour (inteiligence of 7th
Fleet, as an interpreter of the information department). Before going
to the Far East I began my divorce with the former wiie,

At the end of April 1952 I went on a leave in Moscow, Immediately
after returning in Moscow I had a blood cough out, I: the middle of May

finished my treatment and returned in Moscow, Because of the health
I could not return back to the Far East and the personnel department of

B, is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible? In the

past the theory has been advanced that NOSE

.O was never an officer

in the KGB. information of a detailed nature from NOSENKO concern-
ing the KGB, particularly the Second Chief Directorate, nas been 60
extensive as to invalidate any contention that he was not a KGB officer,

It is considered that NOSENKO was a KGB officer in ine claimed
Departments curing the claimed periods of time and served in the claimed
positions in each Department, It is interesting to note that NOSENKO hase
not materiaily varied in his statements in regard to the above since his
original contact in June 1962 (with the exception of his change to 1952 a8
date of his eniry into the KGB and then later reverting to the date given
in 1962). There have been some variations in dates of a minor nature,
as indicated elsewhere in this summary, but these are of month or day
of transfer irom one Department to another and not considered critical
or evidence of deception. NOSENKO has admitted previously giving false

information in regard to rank and medals, but his basic story concerning

0001043



13-00000

os ae

his KGB career today is not significantly different from the fragmentary
version he gave in June 1962.
Basically the following is now considered to have been the KGB
career of NOSENKO:
Mid-March 1953 - late May 1955, First Section,
First Department, SCD
Late May 1955 - December 1959 (1958 - December
1959 = Deputy Chief of Section) Seventh
Department, SCD
January 1960 - December 1961, Deputy Chief of .
Section, First Section, First Department,
scD
January 1962 - July 1962, Chicf of First Section,
Seventh Department, SCD
July 1962 ~ January 1964, Deputy Chief of Seventh
Department, SCD
(NOTE: The term Deputy Chief is being used throughout thie
summary, but the better terminology probably is "Deputy to Chief,"
The position of "Deputy Chief" in United States Government parlance,

including CLA, is not synonymous with the term "Deputy Chie!" as used

in Soviet organizations and more specifically in the KGB. As an example,
a Chief of Department in the KGB or the Chief of a Residentura abroad
may have 2, 3 or even 4 deputies, one of waom is given the titie of

First Deputy, This particular deputy acts in the absence of the Chief

of Department and in genera} has supervisory functions over all the

Department sections. The «+.<eption to the latter is when the Chiei of

Department retains direct supervision over what he may consider the
most important section, Other deputies have supervisory functions only
over designated sections or organizational components, )

During current interviews and in prepared memosanda, NOSENKO
has furnished detailed information which it is considered substantiates

his claimed positions in the KGB, Detailed remarks on these topics are

contained in separate sections of this summary.

It ie realized that GOLITSYN, although confirming that NOSENK
was a KGB officer in both the First Department and Seventh Department,
SCD, has stated that NOSENKO remained in the First Department until
circa 1958 and that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief of the First Section,
First Department, in 1960, It is impossible to correlate this information
with the above indicated opinion that NOSENKO left the First Department

in late May 1955 and was Deputy Chief of the First Section, First Depart-

ment, in 1960, nor is an adequate explanation of these variances available

aes oouLC 45



13-00000

at thie time. On the other hand, it is not reasonable that NOSENKO
would lay claim to the title of Deputy Chief of the First Section, First
Department, if this were not true when he clearly knew of the visits of
GOLITSYN to the First Section in 1960 - 1961 and of his conferences
with officers ciosely associated with NOSENKO at that time,
NOSENKO has also mentioned a number of officers of the SCD
or former cificers of the SCD who transferred to the FCD with whom
he was personally acquainted and who were also known to GOLITSYN,
A number of these officers were officers from whom GOLITSYN has
stated he obtained certain information or through whom he became aware
of certain activities including Viadislav M. KOVSHUK, Gennadiy I.
GRYAZNOV, Vladimir Ivanovich PETROV, Yuriy L GUK, Vladimir
A, CHURANOV, Yevgeniy GROMAKOVSKIY and Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV,
The statement cf NOSENKO that although he had heard of
GOLITSYN he had never personally met GOLITSYN, stands in conflict
with the statements of GOLITSYN that he, GOLITSYN, had met and

talxed with NC?“ “KO in the SCD in the late 1950's. The description

of GOLITSYN of t:is meeiing is that of a casual encounter in the halis

rather than a specific office visit. In light of this, the absence of any
reason why NOSENKO from his point of view should remember such

an encounter and the absence of any reason for NOSENKO to lie on this

a)

issue, it is eminently reasonable to conclude that the encounter took

place but that NOSENKO eimply has no recollection of it, There is

no reason to attach sign-cicance to this lapse of memory.

The previous opinion that NOSENKO did not noid the claimed

tion oi Deputy Chiei, First Section, First Department, curing 1960 -
1961 has had the most me: = in the controversy over his statements

reiat

ive to his KGB carce:, This particular aspect will be covered in
detail in another section, but of note at this time is tne controversy
over what duties the position of Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD, KGB,
entails or does not entail. It is a fruitless exercise to attempt to judge
whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the First Section in i960 - 1961
on the basis of whether his knowledge of the total activities ci the First
Section was commensurate with the knowledge of a Deputy Branch Chief
in CIA in regard to the activities of the entire Branch,

Whether NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of Section in tae SCD,
KGB, must be judged on the basis of what were the duties of a Deputy
Chief of Section in the SCD and in particular what were his cuties in
the particular assignment, The organizational structure of the KGB
may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure

of CIA, but any similarities are surely not such as to permit a judgment

as to whether NOSENKO heid a certain claimed position on the basis

of a comparison of his activities and responsibilities with that inherent

in a somewhat similar position in CIA.

One of the most important differences between United States

agencies or organizations, inciuding CIA, and the bureaucratic structure
of agencies or organizations in the USSR, including the KGB, is the
salary structure. Pay of a KGB officer is based on military ranx and
on actual position held with an additional percentage increase for longevity
and language qualification, Actual position held is important from a
monetary viewpoint in addition to the prestige. As an example, the
difference in monthly salary between a captain and a major is twenty
rubles and the difference in salary between a Senior Case Officer and
a Deputy Chief of Section is also twenty rubles. An increase in miiitary
rank alone has limited pay advantages, as for example a Lieutenant
:

Colonel who is only a Senior Case Officer receives less pay than a major
who holds the position of Chief of Section,

During current interviews, an eifort has been made to obtain

‘ irom NOSENKO statements concerning his responsibilities in the various

claimed positions. The judgment on whether he held or did not hold

the various claimed positions, in view of the absence of any factual

considerable degree on the logic of the statements made by NOSENKO.

Admittedly this is not the most satisfactory way of resoiving the

questions, out it is the only method possible at this time,

moi ion in contacting CLA in 1962 and for his defection in 1964? Of

the cight listed categories which are being given specific consideration
in the matter of the bona fides of NOSENKO, this category is probably
the most difficuit in which to present a logical position with factual
support, There are too many intangible aspects involved and altaough
motivation is an important factor, full resolution of the motivation
problem ie not a paramount factor in deciding whether NOSENKO is or

is not a dispatched agent. NOSENKO could have contacted this Agency in
1962 and defected in 1964 without KGB knowledge and yet even at this late
date have failed to disclose some important events of a personal nature
which actually were important ingredients in his ultimate decision.
Deiecters are humans and have at least the normal reluctance to admit
unfavorable informazion whica.taey consider of a personal nature.

On 31 October 1967 NOSENKO, following a request, furnished a
handwritten memorandum on the topic of his motivation, a typed copy of
which is attached. The memorandum, although not grammatically correct,
is quite understandable and is worthy of review. The tenor of the memo-

i randum is one of increasing disillusionment with the Soviet regime.

best usually a gradual process in which many factors, some recognized
and some not recognized by the individual, have played a role in varying

degrees.

NOSENKO, until 1955 and poss:

y until the death of his iather

in August 1956, could be compared to the profligate son of wealthy

parents in the United States who finally graduates from college and obtains
employment perhaps in the firm of his father without actually earning any of
the luxuries he has enjoyed. The father of NOSENKO was not only wealthy

by Sovict standards but also held a high government position. The

influence of his father and the name vi his iather undoubtedly was an
important if not the most important Jactor in NOSENKO even being
permitted to enter the Naval RU and the XGB even though NOSENAO is
particularly reluctant to admit, perhaps even to himself, that this was
the primary reason.

The above should not be construed as any reflection on the

actual intelligence of NOSENKO, but rather as an explanation of how

NOSENKO could have even entered the Naval RU and KGB. His

following the death of his iather inclu

is undisciplined is supported by his admissions relative to his life in

the USSR and his behavior both in 1962 in Geneva and for a period oi time

after his defec-ion in 1964. NOSZNKO was addicted to women, liquor, and
the material things which can be purchased with money or obtained through

influence,

A question has been previously raised regarding bis motivation

in contacting CIA in 1962, particularly his statement that he needed money
and wouid sell "two Pieces of information. ' NOSENKO aas stated that he
wanted to make a contact with the Americans, that he vas not emotionally

contact he would be making an ultimate commitment from which he could

no longer retreat.

NOSENKO has stated that he gave considerable thought to the
best way to contact the Americans so that he would be believed and not

rejected and came to the conclusion that he would offer to sell some

information, NOSENKO stated that he thought if he approached the

Americans stating he was a "KGB counterintelligence officer who wanted

to give information, "he would not have been believed and would have
been peremptorily rejected, NOSENKO stated he had difficulty deciding
how much money to ask for and how to make the approach, but finally
decided to do it through DawiiiNEAR® whom the KGB considered was with
American Intelligence,

The above statements by NOSENKO are not in conflict with the -

record, NOSENKO did offer to sell “two pieces of information, " almost
immediately gave more information, made no significant demande for
money, and in fact his price for "two pieces of information" was
ridiculously low by American standards. NOSENKO has during current
interviews stated, as he first stated in 1962, that he had spent excessive
amounts of money in one or two riotous evenings. However, NOSENKO
has during current interviews stated that he could have covered hi:

SEGREF

NOSENKO has otated that the night before his departure from
Geneva to the USSR be gave serious thought to defection but wae not
emotionally adapted to defect st that tims. Following his return to the
Sovict Union, NOSENK®O, during a period of time, made his final
Gecieion to defect at the first opportunity, realizing that it meant
leaving his wife, childras, ond other members of hie fer ily in the
USSR.

Some aspects of the motivation of NOSENKO are obscure and
will probably so remain, It would be preferable Lf an exact datailed
chronology of all the factore involved could be prepared or if even
cortsin obvions factors could be accuratoly delineated. These are both
trpossible at this time and probably at any time in the future, What
ig important st thic time te a deciaton v6 to whether the motivation of

SUBJECT: NOSENKO, Yuri Ivanovich

: The following is a typed copy of  noudwritten memorandum
. furnished by Subject on 1 November 1967, following a request on
\ 31 October 1967:
What were the motif and the reasons which have led me to
the decision to breake with the Soviet Russia? The only definite ie an i
underetanding of the situation in the Soviet Russia, the knowledge of

the methods of the communist regime, the knowledge of the real foreign

and interior policies of the Soviet government and the iaith in the right

nesa of the {reo world,

It wae not a decision which was accepted or could be accepted

ina month or a year, This decision was slowly growing inme, 1

think that the beginning was in the studentship,
‘ : Living with my parents and being in the circles of the parent's
{ and my acquaintanceé I knew more then there was written in newspapers

and periodice and that was propagandized by radio and TV, Working in

the Far Eaet and later being in trips in different regione and cities of

Russia I found out much better the life and conditions of the life of the

people of the Soviet Russia.

i When I worked 11 years in MVD-#GB i understood and found |
out very many things, detaile and the real deal of the existing regime,
about methods of the work of MGB-MVD-KGB and about their doings,
about hundreds of thousands of tie people of Russia who were (and
still are) considered "politicaliy" dangerous and around whom was
(and atill is) going an active work of all organs KGB.

At the same time when I was several times abroad I have
seen personally the so-called "decay" at the West, Ihave seen in
reality how is living people, :

Several times when I was abroad 1 was thinking about staying
at the West and not returning in Russia, but only one thing was keeping
me ~~ my family.

In 1962 in Switzerland I made the acquaintance with the
Americans. From my part "the sell of the information" was a real
show, Iwas thinking that they would not beiieve me otherwise, In
that period of the time there was going a big struggle in me to stay
abroad or to return home till the last dayé of living in Geneva and even
when I was returning home in Vienna.

In 1962+1963 I decided definitely that i did not want and could
not live more in the Soviet Russia, In this period of time I have done

all my best to go as soon as possible abroad,

D, Is the information furnished by NOSENZO to CLA concerning

KGB operations, personalities, and organization reasonably commen-

surate with his claimed KGB career? The conclusion is that the infor-
mation furnished by NOSENKO concerning KGB operations, personalities,
and organization is more than reasonably commensurate with nis claimed
career in the KGB from mid-March 1953 to his defection in early February
1964,

In reaching the above conclusion, consideration has been given
to his claimed departmental assignments and claimed positions in each
department, Certain allowance has been made for faulty memory with
consideration being given to whether there is any indication of deception

or whether the fi

lure to recall a particular item of interest can logically
:

be attributed to the vagaries of the human mind. There is, oi course, no

accurate standard of measurement which would permit a positive deter-

mination as to whether inability to recall certain deiails or events is

actually due to the fact that the human mind cannot recall all past events

or could be attributed to willful deception,

An effort has been made to determine if there are any particular
patterns or areas wnere NOSENKO has indicated he did not recali
specific matters or certain detaiis, and no pattern or specific areas

have been noted, NOSENAO, in iact, has an unusually good memory

as evidenced by the extensive information iurnished by NOSENKO purely

from recollection, In addition, there has been no material reiuctance

on the part of NOSENKO io discuss his entire life, KGB off.cers he has
known, KGB organization anc procedures, or other topics c: “uierest,
NOSENKO has furnished considerable detail concerning KGB
officers whom he has known at various periods in his entire KGB career.
He has been very consistent in information furnished and has frequently
added certain details which he recalied at a later date.
Certain remarks will be made in another section in regard to
the volume and scope of information furnished by NOSENKO. This in-

confirm tarough collateral sources that NOSENKO 6¢.:ved in bis claimed
positions, Neither has it been possible to obtain from other sources an
applicable description of the duties or responsibilities of an individual
holding any of the positions NOSENKO claimed to have held after 1958. It
is felt there can be no question that NOSENKO served in the capacities of

junior case officer, case officer, and senior case officer during 1953 - 1957.

mie

As regards the duties and responsibilities of a Deputy Chief of Section,

Chief of Section, and Deputy Chief of Department, and whether NOSENKO
held these various claimed positions, a considerable amount of personal

judgment has been necessary. This personal judgment has been made in
as judicial a manner as possible, with full knowledge that any opinion in !
regard to the above is largely dependent upon information from NOSENKO, H

NOSENKO has compiled detailed diagrams of the actual offices

he claims to have occupied and surrounding offices curing the four pri-
mary periods of time: 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -
1963. He hae prepared specific memoranda concerning his co-officers

and other personnel, and changes of personnel, as well as diagrams

of the offices of the C

i and Deputy Chiefs of the SCD during 1956 -
1964. This material is internally consistent. Furthermore NOSENKO
could not possibly have known that this detailed information could not
immediately be checked for accuracy, at least in part, with a source

or another officer who has defected since mid-1964, Ii these diagrame
and memoranda were not relatively correct, NOSENXO, who is quite
astute in matters of counterintelligence, would hardly have voluntarily
prepared the material in such detail, This type of information is
peculiarly adaptable for analysis by a knowledgeable source or by another
defector and could, if not relatively correct, permit a rather positive con-
clusion that NOSENKO was lying or fabricating information.

NOSENKO has furnished quite specific information on KGB
operations during the 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -
1963 periods of time. As might be expected, his specific knowledge is
Jess or the 1953 - 1955 period; but his own personal situation and attitude
until 1955 - 1956, which are mentioned elsewhere, should be given
consideration. In any event, he has furnished adequate information so
that his claimed assignment during 1953 - 1955 is considered sufficiently
substantiated even though his actual job performance undoubtedly

deserved a low rating.

The knowledge of NOSENiO concerning cases, KGB operations,
and other offic: rs can consistently be related to his claimed department

and position assignment during the 1953 to January 1964 period. The

is broader after 1957 than before, which is comvatible with his claim of

increased responsibilities. His knowledge of the work of other departments

scope of his knowledge of his own department when considered in toto
i

of the SCD irom the late 1950's on is also more extensive, which is aiso a
further indication that NOSENKO actually held the claimed positions

during this pericd of time.

NSA ormployee who defected to the USSR in 1962, end tha Information

Prior to the surfecing of John Discos SMITH by the Soviste
be the tail of 1967, GTTEMES tnformation concerning KGB knowledge
of American code clerks was being investigated; and John Discce
SMITH was a leading suspect. After the surfaciag of SMITH by the
Soviets, {t became apparent that SMITH, rather than HAMILTON, was
tdentical to "ZHARI," Investigation disclosed that no definite informa-
tien could be established {n regard to the actual whereabouts of SAUTH
after circa mid-1960. It cannot be positively stated that appropriate
iaveatigetion in 1964 of the "ZHARI" lead would have led to the identi-
fleation of Joha Discos SMITH a8 "ZHARI," However, such (dontifi-
cation would bave been of conaidersble Interest to the Departmsnt of
Stete and CIA, and could very well kave permitted certata oction which i
would bave at least lessened the propaganda effect of the surprise
Gemouzcement by the Soviets in the fall of 1967.
NOSEKKO, {m June 1962, furnished {rformation from which |

William VASSALL could be quickly identified. GCLITSYN, ta late

tration of the British Government on the basle of, walsh the British

13-00000

Services had compiled a lst af twenty euspects, including VASSALL.
Even though (t may be presumed that {mveatigation of the twenty suspects
would ultimately have resulted in # determination that VASSALL wae
the agent on whom GOLITSYN had furnished certain information, the
information from NOSCNKO tn June 1962 resulted in the earlier termi-
notion by the British Services of a still valuable productive KGB agent.

Aldhough not the case of a KGB agent, the maiter of tha micro-
phones tn the United States Embassy should also be mentioned,
GOLITSYN, following hie defection tm Lecernber 1961, furnished
certain faformation in regard to microphones In the United States
Embassy (Chancery). Since in fact the microphones we.e connected
to contral cables, location of ona microphone would logically have led
to the exporurte of the entire set of inicrophones. However, sppro-

priate ection was not taken on this information and the KGB would have

bean aware tart no action wes taken prior to June 1962 when NOSENKO
fizet contacted CLA.
If NOSENKO te # dispatched KGB agent, It {a rot clear why the

°

KGB would attract spactilc attention to a eyatem of microphones which
aiat have otill had some value ae of June 1962. A preeumption may
be made that tf NOSENKO was a dispatched agent, the KGB had, as of
1962, an advanced system of monitoring devices which rendered the

above microphone system obsolete. However, no concrete evidence

of such an sdvauced system ig available and it should be noted that it

F._Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in

iniorraation furnished by NOSENKO which would warrant a conclusion

that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB? The conclusion in this

summary is that NOSENKO was not dispatched by the KG, in
reaching this conclusion, a full examination of the above «, ‘ion has
been both a necessary and integral part. ai

It is inherent that the volume of information furnished by
NOSENKO is only one of the factors which should be given consideration
in arriving at a conclusion that NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by
the KGB. If NOSENKO was ieee by the KGB, the KGB would have
surely decn willing to sacrifice certain information of value to the KGB
in order te support the bona fides of NOSENKO, However, if NOSENKO
was dispatched, it must have been to accomplish or further a KGB
purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be
unknown.

An examination of the circumstances under which NOSENKC first
contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his behavior during these contacts is
particularly pertinent since during this period of time NOSENKO would
have surely been under direct KGB control if there are any implications

of KGB dispatch in the NOSENKO case.

13-00000

NOSENKO has stated that his original approach to "sell two
pieces of information" was his own idea as to what was most lixely to
be successful. NOSENKO has stated that he wanted to make a contact
with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the

time, and felt that if he merely stated that he was a "XGB counter-

intelligence officer who wanted to give information," he very possibly

would be rejected. It should be noted that NOSENKO even during his
first contact did not limit his remarks to the "two pieces of information"
and began to talk quite freely on other matters.

If NOSENKO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 1962
contacts, would have been very carefully briefed and that his remarks
or statements would have not been of a nature which could cause any
suspicion in regard to the bona fides ef NOSENKO. Instead, Mecteeat
review of his statements and remarks during his five contacts in 1962
indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and actual lies were quite*

likely typical of a braggadocio element in the personality of NOSENKO

and may also have been evidence supporting the statement by NOSE!
that he usually had a few drinks of liquor before each contact in

Geneva.

0001080



13-00000

NOSENKO, during his five contacts in Geneva, made many
statements which in retrospect were impossivie, and the investigation
of which could only have raised cezzain questions con: 2rning NOSENKO.

The following is a list of the more obvious areas in which NOSED

KO
made gross exaggerations or made incorrect or impossible statements.
(a) NOSENKO claimed he personally was with
Oleg M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the SCD, during the
recruitment pitch to James STORSBERG. (This was
a lie and an interview with STORSBERG with display -
of photograph would have disclosed that NOSENKO

did not participate. )

{b) NOSENKO was involved in the recruitment
/ approach to Russell LANGELLE. (This was a lie and
LANGELLE was available for interview. )

(c) NOSENKO said he recruited LUNT

LUNT) in Bulgaria. (Actuaily NOS

O never met

LUNT, }

/ co01esi



13-00000

(4) NOSENXO claimed personal contact with Edmund
STEVENS who, according to NOSENKO, hat been recruited
by the KGB. (NOSENKO actually had never personally met
STEVENS and only bad seen STEVENS once at a distance.)

{e) NOSENKO dated the recruitment of "ANDREY"
in Moscow as 1949-1950, At the same time he furnished
information that "ANDREY" (who is considered identical to
Dayle Wallis SMITii) was in Moscow during a part of the time
that Roy RHODES, also a recruited agent, was assigned to
Moscow, 1951-1953, “ANDREY" (SMITH) wae actually in
Moscow 1952-1954,

(f) NOSENKO said he, GRIBANOV, and anotzer officer
met Edward Ellis SMITH. (NOSENKO has since stated be did
not meet SMITH and that his only role was obtaining a foreign
typewriter and paper for a KGB agent involved in the SMITH
operation. }

(g) NOSENXO in a number of instances spoke in the
first person, caying "We did this," or "We did that," in

reference to a particular KGB activity in which he now admits

f G001082

SECRET



13-00000

he was not involved but had some knowledge. (If

NOSENKO was under KGB control in 1962, doth he

and the AGB should have known that these indicated

exaggerations would eventually lead to a question

concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO. }

In 1562-1963 a number of similarities were noted between
information furnished by NOSENKO and information which had been
furnished by GOLITSYN prior to June 1962. These similarities were
quite striking and gave rise to certain suspicions of NOSENKO because
he provided information which the KGB would presumably have considered
already compromised as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN. Certain
of the similarities at the time could only be explained in terms of
NOSENKO being a dispatched agent, The following are some examples of
the similarities noted.

(a) Both furnished information in regard to

Johan PREISFREUND.

{b) Both furnished information in regard to a
military code clerk case (James STORSBERG).

{c) Both furnished information in regard to a
trip of Viadislav KOVSHUK, under an assumed name,
to the United States. (GOLITSYN was cure it was

connected with a reactivation of an agent formerly in

QO04D%



13-00000

Moscow, or a recruitment of an +

erican formerly
with the United States Embassy in Moscow; and NOSENKO

related it directiy to the

ANDREY" case, giving the

assumed name which KOVSHUK used. )
(cd) Both furnisned information in regard to
microphones in the United States Embassy in Moscow.
(e) Both furnished information in regard to

Edmund STEVENS and Isaac Henry SHAPIRO,

The above list is not complete nor does it indicate the actual
differences in the amount of information furnished on any particalar
topic by GOLITSYN and NOSENKO. To cite the above in detail in tris
aummary is believed unnecessary since the only point of real interest
is whether the fact that NOSENKO was aware of certain events, cases,
ot situations of which GOLITSYN was also aware raises a legitimate
question concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO.

The above area of concern has deen thoroughly examined and
it is considered that the fact that NOSENKO furnished some information

on certain cases or situations previously mentioned in lesser or

greater detail by GOLITSYN cannot logically be construed as evidence

g001cs4



13-00000

ase

that NOSENKO was dispa:

ed by the KGB. NOSENKO has curing

current interviews satisiactorily sourced his information in alm-st
every instance. ina few insiances he has said he did not recali
how he learned of a particular piec. of information but these
apparent lapses of memory were not large in number and are
considered to be in no way suspicious,

The general area in which there was a similarity between
information furnished by GOLITSYN in late 196] - early.1962 and
information furnished by NOSENKO in June 1962 and which would have
been the most significant insofar as the security of the United States
Government was or is cozcerned related to certain activities centering
arocné or in the First Department, SCD.

It is the conciusion of this summary that NOSENKO was an
officer of the First Section, First Department, SCD, during 1953-1955
and was Deputy Chief of the same section in 1960 - 1961. Therefore,
the fact that NOSENKO furnisned information concerning certain cases
or situations in the First Department and the fact that GOLITSYN

furnished information concerning the same case or situation is not

unusual or necessarily suspicious. NOSENKO has stated that GOLITSYN

that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief of the First Section in 1960 has

been noted and commentec on in another section of this summary.

GOLITSYN has furnished certain injormation which he re-

ceived from officers of the First Section, First Department, SCD. '
In each instance where this information, which was fragmentary, could
not be immediately correlated with information from NOSENKO, it was
previously considered to be evidential of deception or lying on the part

of NOSENKO, This position, however, failed to allow for the possibility
that the discrepancies between the two sources were, at least in certain
instances, more apparent than real,

In certain instances it has now been possible to correlate irag-
mentary information from GOLITSYN with information from NOSENKO,
making it evident that in these instances the differences could not be
construed as in any way reflecting against NOSENKO, The four examples
cited below represent two probable correlations, (a) and (b); one possible
correlation, (c); and one instance where no correlation is possible at this
time, (4):

(a) GOLITSYN furnished information which he
received in April-May 1960 from Gennadiy GRYAZNOV
that an attempt had been made by the KGB to recruit an

i 0001087

teat


13-00000

American female employee of the American Embassy
in Moscow through a male Soviet friend, but that tae
attempt had failed, GOLITSYN also furnished information
that the woman had left Moscow by the time he learned of
the information but that the Soviets hoped she would return
to Moscow so that further work could be undertaxen to
efiect her recruitment. He did not recall the name of the
secretary, but did recall that it was a long and "German
sounding" name.

NOSENKO has furnished information in regard to a
recruitment attempt against Collette SCHWARZENBACH,
who it is considered is identical to the "American secretary"
referred to by GOLITSYN. However, SCHWARZENBACH
was not a female secretary in the American Embassy, but
had been employed as a secretary to the wife of Ambassador
BOHLEN during 1955 - 1956 and from 1958 - 1959 was employed
as a correspondent by the United Press in Moscow. The
recruitment attempt against SCHWARZENBACH, according to
NOSENKO, occurred in 1959 and was an operation of the First

Section, First Department, SCD.

mation that GOLITSYN also learned from GRYAZNOV in

the epring of 1960 that GRYAZNv.V had developed an operation

against an American Embasey military code cler# in which the

KG was "99 per cent sure" that the target would be recruited.

This is believed to unde.:biedly be a reference to the case of
James STORSBERG who was actually the subject of a recruit~
ment approach in 1961,

There is considered to be a good possibility that
GOLITSYN actually learned of the above information from
GRYAZNOV in early January 1961 when he was again in Moscow
rather than during the spring of 1960 when GOLITSYN was
preparing for his assignment to Helsinki, Finland. This
theory is supported by information on page 163 of the previous
summary that GOLITSYN has stated he learned in January
1961 from Viadisiav M. KOVSHUX (Chief of the First Section)
that Johan PREISFREUND had recently been used in the
successful recruitment of an American employee oi the
Embassy, Joban PREISFREUND was used in the STORSBERG
operation, according to NOSENKO, and NOSENKO was also

o001Ce9
n

Te

aware that GOLITSYN had a conversation with KOVSHUK about
PREISFREUND since GOLITSYN wanted to use PREISFREUND
in Helsinki, NOSENKO has stated he was not present curing

the above conversation, It is very possibie that KOVSHUK

exaggerated a little in his conversation with GOLITSYN in the
matter of why GOLITSYN could not use PREISFREUND as an
agent.

NOSENKO has furnished extensive information in regard
to the James STORSBERG case and with cue consideration to
the accuracy and recollection of GOLITSYN, there does not
appear to be an adequate basis for questioning the bona fides of
NOSENKO on the basis of the differences between the report-

ing by GOLITSYN of information he received from GRYAZNOV

what is considered to have been the James

STORSBERG case and detailed information furnished by
NOSENKO concerning the James STORSBERG case, The
exact date of the recruitment attempt against STORSBERG
has not been positively established, but it is considered to
have occurred before early May 1961 and probably in the
March-April 1961 period. The statement by James

SEGRER


13-00000

STORSBERG that it occurred in October 1961 is com-
pletely unacceptable and is even contradicted oy other
statements by STORSBERG himseii,

(c) Page 163 of the previous summary contains
information from GOLITSYN which he had received from
GRYAZNOV in April or May 1960 that an American
employee of the Embassy in Moscow was either recruited
or prepared for recruitment on the basis of a homosexual
compromise beginning in 1959 and concluding in 1960,
The previous summary also states that according to
GOLITSYN, the KGB had photographed the American in
various homosexual acts, but SHELEPIN, who had just
become Chairman of the KGB, was at the time stressing
ideoiogical rather than blackmail recruitments. SHELEPIN

cid not exclude future use of the photographs which the KGB

would hold in reserve.

NOSENKO has furnished information concerning the
homosexual compromise of Robert BARRETT, who wae a
guide at the United States Exhibition in Moscow in 1959, and
with whom "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY", two homosexual

GooL1CaL

“SECRETS


13-00000

agents of NOSENKO, became acquainted, Work against
the United States Exhibition was the responsibility of
the Ninth Department, SCD, but various Departments
were particip. ting under the direction of the Ninth
Department,

One of the above homosexual agente succeeded in
involving BARRETT in homosexual activities which were
photographed by the KGB but, according to NOSENKO,
although the photographs were of a good quality, the KGB
was unable to use the photographs in 1959 because of a

general ban by the Central Committee on the recruitment

of the United States Exhibition guides due to the plauned

visit of President EISENHOWER to the Soviet Union,
NOSENKO also stated that the compromising material

and information on BARRETT was later given to the First

Department and that BARRETT was recruited by the Second

Section, First Department when he returned with another

Exhibition in 1961, and that he, NOSENKO, was not involved in

the recruitment operation, BARRETT, following his return

= 000192



13-00000

to the Uniied Staies in January 1962, confessed to the

FBI that he hac been recruited in 1961 on the basis of

compromising photographs which had been taken
during his 1959 trip to Moscow.

Although it cannot be established at this
time, it is possibie that the information furnished
by GOLITSYN which he had received from GRYAZNOV
actually refers to the Robert BARRETT al It should
be noted that Robert BARRETT could not actuaily be
characterized as an “American employee of the Embassy
in Moscow."

(a) Page 162 of the previous summary contains infor-
mation from GOLITSYN that in the spring of 1960 when he
visited the First Section, First Department, SCD, he learned
from GRYAZNOV that GRYAZNOV had as an agent an Embassy
code clerk who was scheduled to be transferred to tielsinki.
GRYAZNOV indicated to GOLITSYN that the code clerk had

already furnished the KGB with some inforraation, that he was

i GauLes3



13-00000

considered by the KGB to be a “real agent and that if
the transfer of the code cierk materialized, GOLITSYN
might have the code clerk as an agent ia Helsinki.

NOSENKO has furnished no information which ca:. be
correlated in any way with the above information from
GOLITSYN, but neither has the information from GOLITSYN
resulted in an identification despite the considerable investigation
which has been conducted in the matter. Although this is
considered to be a valid lead, it need not necessarily refer
to a code clerk who was in the United States Embassy in
Moscow during 1960 - 1961. I: is also possible that the previous
remark by GOLITSYN concerning the above "code clerk" who
might be transferred to Helsinki as well as his cited remarks
in a-c could be clarified or at least additional information
obtained if a specific reinterview on these matters was possible,

The trip of Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki, Finland in

November 1960 should be mentioned in any comparison of information

from NOSENKO with information from GOLITSYN. This conflict is

also mentioned in another section pertaining to the 1960-1961 ce veer
oi NOSENKO. GOLITSYN stated that KOSOLAPOV came to Helsini
to accompany an American Embassy code ciezx on tne train to
Moscow and that KOSOLAPOV planned to strike up an acquaintance
with the code clerk which could be continued in Moscow.

The American Embassy code clerk referred to above was
undoubtedly John GARLAND and the train manifest lists John GARLAND
and Viktor KOLOSOV (Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV) as passengers on the
same train from Helsinki to Moscow, NOSENKO is aware of the
identity of John GARLAND but claims no knowledge of the above trip
of KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki, although being well aware of a previous trip.

NOSENKO, as Deputy Chief of the First Section specifically
charged with work against code clerks, should have been aware oi the
November 1960 trip of KOSOLAPOV to and irom Helsinki. His lack of
knowledge may or may not be explainable in terms of his other activities
such as hie trip to Cuba in November-December 1960 but it cannot be
interpreted as evidence NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB since, if
he had been, the KGB should have briefed NOSENKO on the trip of
KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki in November 1960, as this was an event tae

KGB knew GOLITSYN was aware of.

A theory which has previously been given consideration and
warranted fui) consideration was that if NOSZNKO was cispatched,

his mission was to confuse leads furnished to A

rican intelligence

and/or to é

grate tie value of information furnished by GOLITSYN.

In connection with this theory, it should be noted taat NOSENKO during

current interviews has not made any remarke which could in any way

be construed as derogatory to GOLITSYN. In addition, NOSENKO Goes
not claim to have any detailed knowledge of the FCD and frequently,
when some topic peculiar to the FCD bas been broached with NOSENKO,
his immediate reply has been to the effect that "I didn't work in the CD,"
or "You should ask GOLITSYN about that,"
In connection with any consideration of whether the contact of
NOSENKO with CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have been initiated by
the KGB as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN, the timing of certain
events should be noted. GOLITSYN defected on 15 December 1961,
ry NOSENKO Geparted from Moscow in March 1962 for Geneva, Switzerland,
where he remained until 15 June 1962.
It is felt that it would have been practically impossidle if not

impossible for KGB officials to complete an assessment of the actual or

potential damage which could result from the defection of GOLITSY:

- 001096



13-00000

select NOSENKO as the individual who would be dispatched to counter-

act the possible damage, and appropriately brief NOSENKO prior to

his departure for Geneva in March 1962. Therefore, if NCSENKO ‘

was cispatched by the KGB, it would appear that pians ior this would

have predated the defection of GOLITSYN and that any GOLITSYN

aspect could only be a related aspect and not the basis for tae original

plan to dispatch NOSENKO. In addition, if NOSENKO was dispatched,

it would hardly seem necessary for the KGB to send NOSENKO to

Geneva two and one-half months before hie first contact wita CIA. !
The theory has also been considered that NOSENKO could have

been dispatched to confuse and divert American intelligence and thus

to protect an important KGB penetration or penetrations of the United

States Government, particularly CIA. This is a theory which should

and kas been given full consideration, dui it is not possible to ctualiy
substanti ate or refute this theory in the absence of specific information |
that high-level KGB penetrations do or do not exist.

Actually, as regards NOSENKO, the primary area which should
be given consideration in the above matter is if all the information from

NOSENKO is accepted, what effect would or could it have on the efforts

rt

SECRET

of American counter-intc.Jigence tS dciermine the identity of and
take appropriate action against KGB penetrations of the United
States Government. The only answer to this question seems to be

that there would be iittle consoiation or assurance to American inielli-

gence even if every statement by NOSENKO was accepted at face value,

The only specific area in which NOSENKO could be even con-

sidered to claim futl knowledge is the United States Embassy in Moscow.
In this area hie statements could be construed as assurance that there
were no recruitments of American personnel in the United States Embassy
in Moscow from 1953-December 1963 with she exception of “ANDREY"
(Dayle Wallis SMITH) and Herbert HOWARD. The basis for this
expressed opinion of NOSENKO is considered elsewhere in this summary
and analysts may differ as to whether a recruitment could have occurred
of which NOSENKO did not have knowledge, assuming that his statements
are made in good faith, it should be noted, however, that at this time
there ie no specific information which is in direct conflict with the
expressed opinion of NOSENHO.

NOSENKO, as previously mentioned, has never claimed any
particular knowledge of FCD activities. In addition, he does not claim

to be aware of all recruitments of Americans by the SCD, Asan .

13-00000

example, -he has made it clear that his knowledge of SCD activities

against members of deiegations, ioreign businessmen, foreign students,

ard indivicuais in tae USSR on the iavitation of a Soviet organization or

4 component of the Soviet Government is extremely limized and at best

y of a collateral nature.

NOSENKO does not even claim any detailed knowledge of

activities of the Second Section (Active Line) of the First Department, SCD,

nor does ke claim to know all of the cases of which the Chief of the Seventh

Department was aware, The latter is specifically supported by certain

notes brought out by NOSENKO which are short references to a number

ef Seventh Department cases which are identified only by the KGD code
name, These notes, according to NOSENKO, were made when he had an

opportunity to review a notebook held by the Chief of the Seventh Department

and constitute the only knowledge NOSENKO had of these particular cases.

H._Is there any evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO in 1962

or in 1964 with CIA were known to the XGB prior to his écfection or

that NOSENKO was ever briefed by the KGB relative to his behavior

or KGB objectives during these contacts or aiter his defection? The

conclusion is that there is no evidence that ihe contacts of NOSENKO
in 1962 or in 1964 with CIA were known to the KGB prior to his
defection and that NOSENKO was never briefed in any manner by the KGB.

The basis for the above conclusion is substantially contained in
previous sections. It is being treated ere as a separate area of interest
since it is a sufficiently important area as to warrant individual consideration.

It is recognized that since positive factual confirmation such as
the KGB file on NOSENKO is not available, any conclusion concerning
whether NOSENKO wes or was not dispatched by the KGB can only be

‘ormation from NOSENKO,

based on the iull review of available
collateral sources, independent investigation and the opinion of the
individual analyst concerning the significance or non-significance of
each item of available information.

‘The conclusion that the contacts of NOSENKO with CIA in 1962

and 1964 prior to his defection were not known to the KGB is

necessarily based in part on a judgment as to whether any of his

activities or information logically warrant a substanti

jal suspicion
that they were or could be in any part the result of KGB direction
or control. One of the particular areas considered wae hie apparent

behavior during his contacts with CIA

June 1962 and the conclusion
was that it was incomprehensible that he could have been under KGB
control at that time,

Consideration has been given to the possibility that hie 1962
contacts with CLA were not known to the KGB, but became known to
the KGB later and NOSENKO was doubled by the KGB. it was con-
cluded that there was no basis for or information which would warrant
serious consideration of the above possibility aside from the separate
conclusion that the KGB would be very unlikely to reward a traitcr in
KGB eyes by sending him again to Geneva where he would be quite free
to defect.

Worthy of comment in this section is the iact that NOSENKO,
during his 1962 contacts, expressed considerable concern over his
personal security, requesting that knowledge concezning his identity be

kept to an absolute minimum, that no communications be sent to the

PREViOUS CONCLUSIONS RE NOSENKO.

AS CONTAINED ON PAGES 357 - 360 OF

"THE EXAMINATION OF THE BONA FIDES OF A KGB DEFECTOR"

The foliowing is a quote of the previous conclusions in the case of Yuriy

Ivanovich NOSENAO. (Tine specific conclusions have been give: the designation

of A - G for purposes of easier correlation with otier sections vf this summary.)
“SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES'

“NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in
successively senior positions of aunoriy from which he derived
extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and results of KGB
operations against Americans in the Soviet Union in the period
1953-1963. To substantiate his claim, he provides an impressive
array of information about KGB personnci, organization and opera-
tions which, to the extent that it has been confirmed, is presumptive
evidence of his bona fides, Various Soviet officials, including

' intelligence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's

claims. According to some of these sources, NOSENKO was a

senior KGB officer who occupied a series of sensiive positions, who

6001114


enjoyed considerable autiority and trust despite personal short-
comings, and whose defection, ‘the preatcst loss ever suffered

yzed the work of @& KGB GEGESESR

by Soviet Intelligence’, pa

«Legal Residency, and justified the formulation of plans to assas-

sinate him."

“The examination has compared cach element of NOSENKO's
biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known
facts and reasonable surmise. The ¢xamination rvilects the
test to which his accounts were put; whether his accounts are
internally coherent and consisteni with known fact, and whether

he actually gained the information

has from occupying the
KGB positions he claims to have hcid. In short, is ne what he
says he a according to his own accounts?"
“This examination had led to the following findings, arrived
at independently:
A. NOSENKO cic not serve in the Naval RU
in any of the capacities or at the places and times he
claimed,
B. NOSENKO cid not enter the KGB in the
manner or at the time he claimed.
C. NOSENKO cid aot serve in the American gooiti5
Embassy Sectioa througout the 1953-1955 period as

he claimed.


D. During the period 1955-i960, he was neither
a senior case oificer in, nor Deputy Cnief of, the Seventh
Degartment Arnerican-Briiish Commoaweaith Section.

fof the

E. NOSEN:

KO was neither Deputy

American Embassy Section nor a senior oiiicer or
supervisor in the Section during the period 1961-1962. (sic)
F, NOSENXO's claims, that in 192-he was Caief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section and was"

thereafter a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are

not credible.

~  G, NOSENKO has no valid ciaim to certainty

that the KGB recruited no American Embassy personnel

between 1953 anc iis defection in 1964.
TheSe findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of probability
or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance of available evidence
in each instance."

“Phe above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive evidence
of NOSENKO's bona fices. The contradictions in NOSENKO's accounts

of his life and KGB service are so extensive as to make ais claims

as a whole unacceptabie. While truth and fact in this case frequently

i Go01116


13-00000:

cert

Zot be estabiisned w: ty, itis evident that truth and

fact are not what NOSEN&KO relates. By almost any test, virtually

any of NOSENKO's above claims are

impugned oy iact or probability,
or contradicted or retracted in nis own statements, NOSENKO is

not what he claims to be, and thus he is not a bona fide defector."

“Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is not a dona fide

defector, it is necessary to attempt to determine his true motives

for contacting American intelligence and for providing the information
he has given. Here, it must be recognized that the evidence, largely
consisting of NOSENKO's own assertions, does not permit unequivocal

coaclusions, Nevertriess, the question cannot be ored, The

character of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact that
some of his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet officials,
and the necessity to make decisions about NOSENKO's future all
require that at least a provisional judgment de mace,"

"Of the reasonable explanations advanced ior NOSENKO's
misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a swindler posing
as a former KGB officer for reasons of personal advantage; that he
suffers from a deranged personality or unbalanced mind; that he has
greatly exaggerated his actual rank, status and access in the KGB, for
simply personal reasons; or, finally, that he is a dispatched KGB

GOOLL17

agent."


13-00000

jities are easily dismissed. That
is not simply a swindler who falsely claims for personal

advantage te have been a KGB ofiicer is evident, we believe, irom

the confirmed details of KGB organization, persorrel and operations
which he has provided and which couid only derive from within the
KGB itself."

“Second, as noted in the ext, extensive psychiatric and

psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out the"

possibility that NOSENKO’s actions and testimony are the product
of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind."

"It is somewhst more plausible that NOSENKO is a KGB
officer who served in at icast some of the components for some
or all of the time periods that he claims, but who greatly exag-
gerated his positions, rank and access to intormation, and
invented some matters outright, to achieve greater status with
American Intelligence. This expianation, however, fails to

accommodate the fact < several XGB oijiicers have asserted

that NOSENKO did in fact aold senior positions in the KGB. Also,
NOSENXO's assertions with respect to ais rank, GRIBANOV's
patronage, the recall telegram, and the like, cannot be justa

product of his own invention, since these were the subject of

, 0001118

comment by other sources."

“Because none of tae above explanations is consistent with
the data ceveloped in interrogations and investigations, we are
left with the nypothesis that NOSENKO was dispatched by the ‘
KGB. Waiie this e.pianation does not reconcile all the anomalies,
none of them renders it untenable, "

“In the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or

%

other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that the _
evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was dispatched
by the KGB, an¢ believes that prudence requires that he be

regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and that his infor-

mation snould be assessed accordingly."

A, XOSENKO cic not serve in the Naval RU in any of the capacitics

or at the places and times he claimed, (Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "A" in the previous summary in regard

tc NOSENKO. The current conchision is

at tre claimed service
NOSENKO in Navy Inieliigence (Naval RU) during March 1951 to early
1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas is adequately substantiated
and should be acceptec,

The interrogations of NOSENKO prior to 1967 were complicated
by NOSENKO changing the date of his gracuation irom the institute of
International Reiations irom 1950 to 1949 because he did not wisn to

admit that he had failed to graduate in 1949

ih the majority of his class.
However, ‘previous e<iorts of NOSENKO to revert to his original 1962
statement that he graduated in 1950 were not accepted and an unwarranted
significance was given to the 1949 - early 1953 period of time.

It is considered that NOSENKO has adequately explained his
“stupid blunders" as they relate to the above and to certain other personal

matters and that his claimed service in Navy Intelligence from March

bey goostzt



13-00000

195i to early 1953 both in the Far East and the Baltic area is fuliy

accepiabie, It is not considered necessary to comment concerning all

he remarks in the previous summary regarding the claimed Naval
RU service of NOSENKO as reflected on pages 49-59 and remarks wiil,
for purposes of brevity, be limiied in scope.

The statement is mace in the previous summary that "The sole
Headquarters RU officer NOSENKO identified was the Personnel Chief,

Colonel KALOSHIN. He ide:

‘ied no ranking officers in either the Baltic
or Far East Intelligence Staffs. Some 30 GRU officers he did identify,

by his own admission, NOSENKO knew not {rom his Naval RU service,

but through social acquaintance, later, in Moscow, or through hia visits

to Geneva,"
Attached is a copy of a handwritten memorandum voluntarily

prepared by NOSENKO in late i967 containing the names of a number

of GRU personnel of whom ke had some knowledge. The attached was
not prepared as the result of.any inquiry concerning his claimed Naval
RU service, but was only a small part of the material prepared by
NOSENKO at this time, The entire material included remarxs by
NOSENKO regarding approximately 875 KGB officers, 100 KGB agents,

35 GRU officers and 400 other Soviet nationals.

:

It is interesting to note that the attached list contains the names

of approximately 26 GRU cers whom NOSENKO relates to the cariy

1950's period, In addition, NOSENKO has, during current interviews

and in other memoranca, furnished the names of additional Navy Inteli-
gence personnel whom he knew in the 1951 - early 1953 period.

Page 52 of the above summary and other related pages cuestion

whether NOSENKO ever served in the Baltic area with Naval Inteliigence
and even Guestion his geographical knowledge of the area, Attached is a
copy of a handwritter. memorandum with certain diagrams prepared by
NOSENKO on 21 February 1968 concerning his assignment with Navy
Intelligence ia the Far East and the Baitic area, The memorandum was
completed by NOSENXO without any reference material and a review of
his diagrams indicates they are quite accurate.

NOSENKO nad previously stated that his service in the Baltic
area was at Sovetsk Primorskiy and during current interviews recailed
that the former name of the place, an almost deserted fisnermen's :
village, was Fishausen, The previous designation given by NOSENKO
for this place as having the mail address of Sovets Primorskiy had
caused the conclusion that his alleged place of assignment was non-
existent, A further check in,the-matter would have disclosed that the
i place was not nonexistent, that it is currently known as Primorsk and
~J that the former German name of the fishing village was Fischhausen,

f fi (001423


13-00000

The previous summary aiso stated that despite his claimed

active cornmissioned service in ihe Navy, NOSENKO knew nothing of

Soviet Navy tradition, doctrines, or organization of procedures, it
sould be noted that there is a considerable difference between being
a member of the Naval RU and being an actual member of the Soviet

Navy. The situation could be compared to a career civilian employee

of the Oiiice of Naval Intelligence and a line officer in the United Siates

Navy.

NOSENKO cic not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time

neg, (Previous conchusion)

The above is conclusion "B" in the previous summary in regard
tw NOSENKO, The conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO entered
tue then Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his
entry wae not only facilitated by but duc to the influence of General
Bogdan Zakharovich KC3ULOV.

Previous statements by NOSENKO and changes relative to date of
entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section of the summary
and will not be repeated here, His statements during current interviews
that he entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a case officer in the First
Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, are con«
sidered adequately Raeriren and should be accepted,

The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) that
NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed
was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSENKO as to when
he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in

1965 NOSENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.

oob1132



13-00000

in 1964, NOSENKO had given two dates in 1952 as iis time of entry into
the KGB in an eifort not to admit that he had failed to graduate from the
Institute of International Relations in i949.

The previous summary gave considerable weight to the statements
oi NOSENKO indicating that he did not enter the KGB (MVD) under what
are considered normal KGB procedures, Proper allowances were not
given for position of the father of NOSENKO, the Minister of Shipbuilding, a
and the influence of General KOBULOV. An analyst can either accept or
reject the statement of NOSENKO that he entered the KGB (MVD) through
the influence of General KOBULOV; but, if the statement is accepted, then
the failure of NOSENKO to be required to follow normal KGB procedures
should aleo be accepied. A Communist society or a Soviet intelligence
organization is not and could not be immune to influence by a bigh official.

Genera] KOBULOV as o:

the Minister of the then MVD.
The previous summacy raises several points concerning the
eligibility of NOSENKO for the KGB (MVD). It points out on page 67
that other than bis undistinguished period of service with the Naval RU,
he was no more eligible for a KGB appointment in 1953 than he was at

the time of his previous rejection in 1950, This statement is not contro-

rtible and is fully accepted with the qualification that in 1950 NOSENKO

7 GOOL133

-SECREF

$


13-00000

was not sponsored by any pereon of influence as was tae case in 1953
with General KOBULOV who in mid-March 1953 was the First Deputy

to BERIYA.

‘The previous summary also siates that according to KGB

defectors familiar with the standards in jorce at the time, no candidate

was accepted who had ever had tuberculosis. This is a flat statement

which it is doubtiul any defector or series of defectors could fully

%

substantiate; namely, that it never happened. Until and unless it is
medically proven that NOSENKO did not have tuberculosis, it is accepted
that he did have tuberculosis in 1952 and was at a sanitarium -- rest

piace in Kubinka. It is also accepted that he was an o

er in the KGB

after mid-March 1953. The influence of KOBULOV could undoubtedly

have permitted NOSENKO to entex the KGB even though he previously

had tuberculosis, but the flat staternent taat no candidate was accepted who

had ever had tuberculosis is not and cannot be sufficiently substantiated.
The previous summary contained a number of additional remarks

and conclusions intended to show that NOSENKO was not eligible for and

therefore could not have entered the KGB (MVD). Comments concerning

these wiil be brief since there is considered to be no adequate basis at

this time on which to contend that NOSENKO did not enter the KGB

(MVD) as an officer in mid-March 1953. A comment was made that

13-00000

KO Gid not take a physical examination in connection with nis

processing for KGB entry, and that such a medical examination was
4 routine and mandatory part of the processing of a KGB candidate.
This statement makes no allowance for the influence of General
KOBULOV; but, in addition, does not ceasider the fact that the Navai

RU dossier on NOSENKO was avaiiable to the KGB (MVD).

The previous summary also failed to note that tae MVD wouid

. . have had independent injormation in regard to NOSENKO since the MVD

“would have conducied any iécessary inquiry in connection with the entry
of NOSENKO into the Naval RU. As of 1953, the MVD undoubtedly also
had a dossier on the father of NOSENKO since this was still the STALIN
era, :

The summary also states that NOSENKO did not complete the

necessary iengthy Anketa before entry into the KGB (MVD) and di

personnel office fice, It woud

visit the personnel

seem that the influence of General KOBULOV could have permitted the
elimination of most if not all of the necessity of complying with normal
procedures, but NOSENKO has during interviews stated that he com-
pleted the Anketa while sitting at his desk after entry into the KGB (MVD),

Page 70 of the previous summary states that NOSENKO did not

know the designation of his own Directorate either at the time he allegedly

‘| WULL35



13-00000

entered on duty or during his first year of KGB service. While
NOSEZENKO has claimea that the designation of bia Directorate at the
time he entered the KGB (MVD) in mid-March i953 was the Second
Chief Directorate and that it subsequently ws redesignated the

First Chief Directorate, DERYADBIN bas staincd this reversal of

csignations occurred in March 1953.

va," (STALIN died In-barly Marea 1953 and that eame mont the
MVD and the MGB were merged under the name MVD with BERLYA
as Minister, BERIYA held this position until his arrest in early June
1955. BERIYA was succeeded by KRUGLOV, who held office for less
thana year. Yuriy RASTVOROV was recently queried concerning the
date of the reversal of the designation of the FCD and SCD and places
it as the end of April or early May 1953, GOLITSYN has indicated that

the ci fe occurred "s0on after the advent of BERIYA as nead of the

MVD in April 1953," In the light of our inability to fix the eifective cate
of the reversal of the designations of the SCD and the TCD, it is
unreasonable to impugn NOSENKO on his statement as to the designation
of his Directorate at the time of his entry into the KGB (MVD).

There is a disagreement between NOSENKO and others as to who
was responsible for the reversal of designations of the FCD and the SCD.

NOSENKO is of the opinion that it occurred under KRUGLOV, which is

of designations, it would appear that NOSED

\KO is inerror, tiowever,

the fact that he was a new junior officer and that this was a period of

upheaval in the KGB (MVD) effectively eliminates any significance in

this issue.

NOSENKO is criticized in the previous summary for not knowing
the location of the Chief Directorate of the Militia or the history of the
iI (Committee of Informatioz). NOSENKO has stated that he had no
contacte with cither office during 1953-1955 and there is no adequate reason

to disbelieve this statement. He is not aware of when the AI ceased to

exist (193) ver iu tae summary, but other information indicates the KI

memory concerning the location and their knowledge of Agency ‘acilities at

any given period of time or when Agency components or related organizations

were organized or ceased to exist.

The point has also been made that any career of NOSENKO
in the KGB shoud have ended or he should have at least encountered
difficulty when his denefacior General KOBULOV, together with the
brother of General KOBULOV, was arrested with the BERIYA group in

early June 1953, NOSENKO has during current interviews stated that he

encountered no culties but is aware that the KOBULOV connection cd
was discussed by an officer from the Personnel Directory with an

official of the First Department. Under other circumstances NOSENKO

would very possibly have encountered difficulty; but, it should be noted

that the father of NOSENKO retained his position, that NOSENKO only

met General KOBULOV through his father, and that NOSENKO has stated

that although nis father knew General KOBULOV, his father could in no

way be considered a member of the BERIYA group.

KO cid not serve in the American Embassy Section

throughout the 1953 - 1955 pericd as ne claimed, (Previous conciusion)

The above is conclusion "C" in the previous summary. The
conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO was an officer oi the First
Section (American Embassy Section), First Department, from mid-March
1953 to late May 1955 when he was transferred to the Seventh Department,
ScD.

This period of time has been covered in detail with NOSENKO
during current interviews, The conclusion is that NOSENO was an
vilicer in the First Section but was not a very, effective officer and that
both his work and behavior were decidedly influenced by the fact that he
was the son of the Minister of Shipbuilding. NOSENKO is reiuctant to

admit that he was other than slightly lackadaisical in his work curing

this period of time, but is not hesitant to admit that his personal be-
havior was such as to cause him to be removed as Secretary to the

Komsomol unit in 1954 and to cause an unsatisfactory "characterization"

Sa

- his father was advised of his d

to be prepared in early 1955 which necessitated a decision as to whether
he would be fired irom the KGB or transierred to some other component.

‘The influence of his family is quite apparent in the above since

culties in 1954 by an official of the
KGB and his mother interceded on his behalf in 1955 with the Caiei of
SCD. The result in 1955 was that NOSENKO was transferred to the
Seventh Department and not fired from the KGB.

The question has been raised as to how NOSENKO could remain

in the KGB when after 1954 he was not a member of the Komsomol and

le to become a candi

te for the Communist Furty, This
is a valid question but a plausible explanation is again the fact that he was
the son of the then Minister of Shipbuilding.

NOSENKO has stated curing previous anc current interviews tia:
following his entry into the KGB and until circa mid-1954 he was respon-
sible for work against American correspondents in Moscow. He has not

claimed that he had any successes and has stated that the work with news-

paper correspondents already recruited was being handled by other o:
NOSENKO has explained that during this time he was a "new officer, "
indicating he could hardly Lave been expected to act as an experienced
officer, His knowledge of correspondents in Moscow during this period

of time, together with his knowledge oi other KGB officers and his

2 GOOL144


13-00000

—_——-

information concerning his own azents is believed of sufficient weight
to accept the statement of NOSENKO that work against American cor-
respondents was his assignment irom mid-March 1953 to mid-1954,

From circa mid-195¢ until nis transfer to the Seventh Depart-
ment in late May 1955, NOSiNKO ciaims and has claimed he was an
officer of the First Section with the responsibility of work against the
Military Attaches (Army) at the United States Embassy in Moscow. It
is considered, based on his knowledge of the various Military Attache
personnel and other coliateral information furnished by NOSENKO, that
NOSENKO was an officer. of the First Section during the mid-1954 - late
May 1955 period of time, that his primary work was against members
of the Office of the Military Attache, but that the quality of his work
undoubtedly left much to be desired.

In circa mid-1954, NOSENKO was removed as Secretary of the
Komsomol unit and by early 1955 bis performance was such that at least
certain officials in the First Department desired his removal from the
First Department, if not the KG3. Under these circumstances,
NOSENKO could be criticized as having been a very poor if net
undesirable KGB officer, but his knowledge of the First Section during

this period of time and his knowledge of the members of the Office of

the Military Attache supports the clairn of NOSENKO that he was an
oificer of the Firs? Section with the indicated assignment as related
by him.

NOSENKXO has stated that the work against the Military ‘

Attaches was not primarily directed toward development of recruitment
possibilities, but was directed toward control of the Military Attaches
on trips in order to prevent observation of sensitive areas, sensitive
sites or sensitive activities in the USSR. This attitude by the KGB

would appear to be completely plausible and NOSENKO noted as

exceptional in this regard the recruitment attempt against Captain Waiter
MULE. NOSENKO explained thie exception as retaliation for approaches
to Soviets in the United States in that period.

NOSENKO has been criticized because he did not know all the
details concerning the Military Attaches which it was considered he
should have known ii he had the specific responsibility for work against

the Military

ches during the indicated period of time. it is submitted

that this may be evidence o: his failure to satisfactorily fulfill his

The effectiveness or non-eifectiveness of NOSENKO during his
assignment to the First Section, First Department, from mid-March
1953 to late May 1935 can have little pertinency in the question of the |
bona fides of NOSENKO if it is accepted that he actuaily was an oificer
in the First Section during this period of time. It is felt that information
furnished by NOSENKO in current interviews and in previous interviews
is of sufficient scope and detail that his claimed service as an officer

in the First Section during this period of time is completely acceptable.

D. During the period of 1955 - 1900, NOSENKO was neither e

senior case officer in, nor Deputy Chief of, the Seventh Department,

American-British Commonweaith Section, (Previous conclusion)

‘The above is conclusion "D" in the previous summary. The
current conclusion is that NOSENKO was an officer in the Seventh
Department, SGD, from late May 1955 to December 1959 and was
Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section, Seventa
Department from 1958 to December 1959.

During current isiterviews, NCSENKO has furnished extensive
information concerning his own activities in the Seventa Department
during the 1955-1959 period. Interviews of persons who were the sudject
of KGB interest collateraily confizm that NOSENKO was personally in-
volved in certain claimed activities during 1955 to December 1959.
These activities include among others the recruitment of Richard BURGI
in June 1956, contact with Sir Allen LANE ané Arthur BIRSE in the
summer of 1957, the recruitment of Gisella HARRIS in 1958, the re-

cruitment of George DREW in the spring of 1959, the recruitment of

pope vrata

William Stanley WILBY in June 1939, the recruitment of David. TAYLOR
in the summer of 1959, the recruitment of Gerard MERTENS in July -
August 1959, and the recruitment of Arsene FRIPPEL in 1959. The
foregoing is not a complete list of all cases in which NOSENKO claims
personal involvement, but is representative of cases in which his alleged
participation has been confirmed by interviews with the individual who
was the KGB target. :

Sir Allen LANE, Arthur BIRSE, William Stanley WILBY, and
David TAYLOR were British citizens and the other above-named indi-
viduals were United States citizens. This would seem to substantiate
the claim of NOSENKO that during 1955 - December 1959 he was'an
officer engaged in KGB operations against American-British Common-
wealth tourists in the USSR,
it In addition, NOSENKO has furnished specific information about
an operation against Martin MALIA, an American tourist who was in
the Soviet Union from approximately September 1935 to December 1955,
MALIA has not been interviewed and «vill not be interviewed, so at thie
time no particular 1955 case in which NOSENKO claims involvement

or personal knowledge has been substantiated by interview of the

individual involved,

veloped after 1955 which primarily consisted of Intourist personnel
and two homesexual agents, “SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" (GB code
names), whose extensive use in KGB operations has been confirmed by
interviews with individuais who were the subject of homosexual com-
promise operations.

ceded that, if ali the sub-conclusions and the interpretations of. various
areas of information were accepied witaout qualification, there is any

are certain assumptions and interpretations which appeared in the
previous summary which are particularly worthy of cominent and which
are considered erroneous or require additional clarification.

On page 145 it is stated that the evidence suggests that NOSENKO

was an English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a counter-

intelligence officer responsible for the identification of foreign agents

among tourists or for the development, recruitment, and exploitation

of agents for the KGB. The Second Chief Directorate, KGB, and the
MVD have used homosexual and heterosexual compromise in numerous
known {and presumably unknown) successful recruitments and recruit-
ment attempts. This activity has not been limited to the Seventh Depart-
ment, SCD; and the innuendo that NOSENKO was “only an English-

speaking specialist in sexual entrapment" and not a KGB g@@dd Wen

considered with the detailed information NOSENKO has. provided on
Seventh Department personnel, activities, procedures, and topice of
a similar nature is not considered to have any foundation in fact.

| Page 145 of the above summary lists eleven operations which

i were Seventh Department cases prior to 1960 and which were included

in the notes furnished to CIA in 1964 by NOSENKO. The named operations

were those against Bernard PECHTER, Patrick PRESSMAN, John RUFE,
Gerald SEVE&N, Sofia SHATTAUER, (inu) KARLOV, Norman FISK,
Ralph MATLAW, Marvin KANTOR, Michael GINSBURG, and William
TARASKA. The criticism made in regard to the above elevin cases

was that NOSENKO could not describe the in

idual operations other
than to say that he had recorded the name of the target and such detaile
as he could acquire when he reviewed.the activities of the Seventh Depart-
+ ment in 1962 foliowing his return from the Firet Department.

The notes brought out by NOSENKO axe considered in another

section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a iuil review

of all of the notes of NOS=)

‘<O currently availabie indicates that his
statements as to how and why he obtained the information in the notes
are completely piausible. A detailed explanation of the notes furnished

by NOSENKO would almost necessitate a separate listing of the approxi-

mately 150 cases or names mentioned in the notes.

During current interviews, NOSENKO furnished specific
information on certain of the above eleven cases, including Wiliiam

» Michael GINSBURG and John RUFE.

TARASKA, Bernard PECiHT.
it skouid aiso be noied that certain of the cases such as Marvin. KANTOR

iam TARASKA were cases in which the tourist was visiting

and
relatives in the Soviet Union and that NOSENKO hae given a satisfactory
expianation of how he iearned of the KANTOR case.’ NOSENKO hag, in
discussing hie duties as Deputy Chief of the American-British Common-
wealth Section, algo explained that if a tourist indicated that he intended
tovisit relatives in the USS, the case automaticaily was assigned toa
group of officers in the Section who reported directiy to the Chief of
Section and were not under the supervision of NOSENKO.

NOSENKO has stated that he noted the names of three of the

z individuals when retiring the iiles of "GRIGORIY" and "SHMELEV, "

two homosexual agents of NOSENKO previously mentioned. NOSENKO
has expiained that "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" had the assignment of
identifying American travelers with homosexual tendencies, that they
had contact with numerous Americans, and that they had homosexual

activity with individuals on whom they reported but on whom no overt :

action was taken by the Seventh Department, In some cases the individual

go01153

— SECRET



was not considered a worthwhile target and in others the information
Was just maintained for possible use at a later date if the individual
revurned to the USSR.

NOSENKO has aiso explained how he learned of the Patrick
PRESSMAN and Gerald SEVERN cases; and, the iisting of the Sofia
SHATTAUER case in connection with the 1955 - 1959 period is in com-
plete error since page 427 of the previous summary contains information
from NOSENKO on her recruitment in 1962. During current interviews
the notes which NOSENKO brought out in 1964 have been discussed in
detail with NOSENKO, He has given.a detailed explanation of the material
which he brought out and his explanation of all aspects ie very convincing.

The prevjous summary (page 144) suggested that the involvement
oi NOSENKO in certain cases being handled by other Sections in the
Seventh Departinent or by the KGB Directorate of Moscow was, unusual,
An exarnination of the cited cases does not indicate that his participation
was unusual, but rather that his explanation of why ne was involved is
logical and normal, No consideration was previously given to the English
language capability of NOSENKO or the fact that his own homosexual agents
were used in two of the four cited cases,

The summary also noted that there was a question concerning

whether Gisella HARRIS was necessarily a Seventh Department case.
goust54

This question seems quite superfluous since HAM i:-i.was in the USSR

on a tourist visa and "real" tourists are the responsibility of the Seventa
Department, Departmental responsibility within the SCD ior an indi-
vidual traveling in te USSR is décided on the basie of how the individual
is traveling; i.e., whether on a tourist visa, as ‘a member of a delegation,

as the invitee of an organization in the USSR, as a iormer diplomat

stationed in Moscow, as a diplomat not previotsly stationed in Moscow, a
as a member of the Cultural Exchange program, as a student attending
a university in the USSR, etc. There are also various other factors

which affect the determination of which Department or organizational

component of the SCD has the responsibility for a tourist case. These

factors incluée whether the individual is already suspected of foreign
intelligence connections ané whether the individual is 4 businessman.

th addition, certain actual tourists in the USSR may never become the

responsibility of the SCD if the individual is of specific interest to the
FCD.

On pages 148 - 149, NOSENKO is criticized for not knowing at
least some of the substance of the information furnished by George
BLAKE in regard to the CIA-MI-6 program of utilizing tourist agents
in the USSR. This criticism completely ignored the fact that NOSENKO

made severai references in 1962 to the KGB having such information

6001155


Sa ‘

althouga he cic then ané stiil suspects that William VASSALL was the

source. The references by NCSENKO 10 the KGB having such i
mation were not developed in 1962 or later interrogations, and it was

blisned that NOSENHO had.

actually seen excerpts of information passe’ by George BLAKE.

According to NOSENKO, the information which was obviousiy only

partial was furnished to the FCD by the SCD and could only have come

from an agent,
The previous summary (page 149) also notes that in 1961 CIA
acquired a lengthy Top Secret study on the subject of the use of tourists
by American Intelligence for espionage and operational support in the
Soviet Union (document was iurnished by GOLITSYN following his de-
fection in December 1961), it was noied that the summary contained
“references to certain 1958 - 1959 tourists whom the KGB counter-
intelligence identified as American agents and noted that NOSENKO
claimed he was Deputy Chief oi the American-British Commonwealth
Section in this period of time and that he claimed the KGB icentified
no American Intelligence agenis curing this period of time. What later
is described as a claim by NOSENKO is neither an accurate reflection

of what NOSENKO said prior to 1967 or has said since 1967.

NOSENKO ias never claimed to know all activities against
American travelers in the Soviet Union curing 1958 ~.1939. Many
of these travelers would ave been the responsibility of a section in
the Seventh Departinent, other than the Ameriean-British Cormmon-
wealth Section, or another Department'in the SCD, NOSENKO was
quite aware that certain of the American tourists in 1958 -.1959 were
actiz.g suspiciously from a KGB point of view.

NOSENKO has stated he was aware that a document which the
Seventh Department kad prepared and iurnished to the FCD in an effort
to obtain further assistance from the FCD in the work against tourists
had been compromised by GOLITSYN, NOSENKO stated he wae not in
the Seventh Department when the document was prepared and did not
review the document until after the defection of GOLITSYN and foiiow-
ing advice from the FCD to the Seventh Department, SCD, that the
document had been compromised. The document furnished by GOLITSYN
has never been reviewed with NOSENKO to determine if it contained
additional information not in the document which he was aware had
been prepared by the Seventh Department for the FCD.

NOSENKO has been impugned on his apparent unfamiliarity with

‘a number of cases cited as examples in the document furnished by

GOLITSYN. In current interviews, however, the descriptiq}§{MEGENKO

It ip not bellowed that the listed failures of NOSENK® to identify

tions &e to what the KGS knows, it {s possible that (0) the KGB did not i

te the KGB was not available at the First Section, First Department,

euggested in epite of claims by NOSENIKO that he had to have known

13-00000

F,_NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the .

American-British Commonwealth Section and was thereafter a

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible. (Previous
Rezuty

conclusion)

The conclusion of this summary is that NOSENKO was Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section (First Section) from
January 1962 to July 1962 and that he was a Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Department thereafter.

NOSENKO has stated that, although he was offered the position
of a Deputy Chied of the First Department, SCD, by Oleg M. CRIBANOV,
Chief, SCD, and although an order had beea prepared and was in the
Personnel Directorate, he declined the proffered position,

According to NOSENKO, he knew that Sergey Mikhaylovich
FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the First Department, did not want NOSENKO
as a Deputy Chief, but instead wanted to promote Vladislav KOVSHUK,

then Chief of the First Section, to the position, FEDOSEYEV was

SECRET Co01218



willing to promote NOSENKO to the position of Chief, First Section.
However, GRIBANOV id not wish to promote KOVSHUK and NOSENKO
considered that under the circumstances it would be better for him to
return to the Seventh Department rather than to become a Deputy to
FEDOSEYEV who wanted KOVSHUKas a Deputy.

Vladimir Dmitriyevich CEELNOKOV had offered NOSENKO the
position of Chief of the First Section, Seventh Department, pending the
reassignment of BALDIN to Germany at which time NOSENKO would
become a Deputy Chief, Seventh Department, replacing BALDIN. The
above explanation of NOSENKO seems plausible and credible and indi-~
cates that GRIBANOV, the Chief of the SCD, for reasons best known to
GRIBANOV, was assisting NOSENKO in his career in the KGB.

This section actually covers two periods in the claimed career
of NOSENKO; namely, January - July 1962 as Chief of the First Section,
and July 1962 - January 1964 as a Deputy Ciief of the Seventh Depart- ‘
ment, Since NOSENKO was in Geneva, Switzerland, irom March to
June 1962, he actually cannot be seriously faulted for not having de-
tailed knowledge of the activities of the First Section during January -
July 1962. The previous summary (pages 268 - 291) contains remarke
in regard to the January - July.1962 period, including the period of

March - June 1962 when he was in Geneva. Four specific tourist cases

Qd0L1219

‘s CoE



are discussed in the previous summary: the cases of Wallace Everett
JOUNSON, William Carroll JONES, Natalie BIENSTOCK, and Horst
BRAUNS. Apparent conilicts between information from NOSENKO and
information Cerived from subsequent ‘interviews with these individuals
were cited as evidence impugning NOSENKO, It-is not believed that the
previous comments concerning these cases constitute any substantial
evidence that NOSENKO did not hold the claimed position of Chief oi the
First Section, Seventh Department, during January - July 1962. That
there were KGB operations against JOHNSON, JONES, BIENSTOCK and
BRAUNS has been confirmed through interviews by the FBI of all four
individuals.

A few additional remarks in regard to the above four cases are
warranted, not because it is considered that there are any substantial
discrepancies between waat NOSENKO has said and what each individual
stated when interviewed, but because they may provide additional clari-
fication,

In the Wallace Everett JOHNSON case, it was previously noted
that JOHNSON arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961 and that the KGB
operation against him occurred on 5 January 1962, The summary sug-
gested that the short lapse of time indicated that the homosexual tend-
encies of JOHNSON were known to the KGB prior tohis arrival, contrary
to the statements of NOSENKO, NOSENKO during curgantiinesgviews

EJ

SEGRE


13-00000

has stated that the KGB learned of the homosexual tendencies of JOHNSON
“by chance" soon aiter his arrival, “SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY," two
homosexual agents of NOSENZO, were at the time operating ovt of a room

at the Metropol Hotei where JOHNSON stayed, They met JGHNSON there
and reported his apparent homosexual tendencies.

In regaré to the William Carroli JONES case, NOSENKO during
current interviews has furnished additional information on the AGB operation
against JONES, including the woman Ludmila BUGAYEVA wio was recruited
as an agent to work against JONES and was used in another case. The other
details furnished ie NOSENKO concerning the JONES case are compatibie
with his claim to having been Chief of the First Section, ‘Severth Department,

In regard to the Natalie BIENSTOCK case, NOSENKO did not claim
to have been the responsible case ofiicer but was able to provide enough

_ Specific information concerning the case to bring about a confession when
she was interviewed by the FBI, That he did not know all the cetails con-
cerning the BIENSTOCK case could be explained by his claim to have been
Chief of Section and not the case oificer directly involved wita the case,

In regard to the Horst BRAUNS case, in the previous summary
the criticism was levied that NOSENKO did not know why BRAUNS visited

the USSR and was not able to identify any Soviet citizens whom BRAUNS

met in the USSR, It was also stated that NOSENKO had explained that

—

the Seventh Department was not concerned wita foreigners visiting
relatives in the USSR nor wica Soviet expatriates, NOSENKO, accord-
ing to the previoss summary, was aware that BRAUNS was a former
Soviet citizen and the summary stated tbat his plan to visit relatives
was information available to the KGB cirough kis visa application.

In regard to the statement that the Seventh Department was not
concerned with foreigners visiting relatives in the USSR nor with Soviet
expatriates, this is not in agreement with current information from
NOSENKO, * Cases of "true" tourists, which were normally the respon=
sibility of the Seventh Department, could become the responsibility of
another department or KGB component where Soviet relatives were
involved, However, if the case was not taken over or assigned by higher
authority to another department or component, it was and remained the
responsibility of the Seventh Department, The fact that BRAUNS was a
former Soviet citizen could very well have made BRAUNS of interest to
the Second Section, First Department, or a direction in the Service of
the SCD, However, in the absence of an actual reassignment by higher
authority, the case would remain the responsibility of the Seventa Departe
ment since BRAUNS was visiting the Soviet Union on a tourist visa. The
previous summary also indicated that BRAUNS listed on his visa appli-

cation that he planned to visit relatives in Leningrad, BRAUNS had a

relative or relatives in Leningrad, Although BRAUNS, when interviewed by
the FBI, mentioned a number of items oi which the KGB was aware concern-
ing his background and occupation irom his visa application, there is no
specific reierence in these interviews indicating his statement of purpose
in visiting tie USSR.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary revicws remarks by

NOSENKO on the Boris BELITSKIY case and states that his claimed role

in the case was not plausible. There are several stccific points made in
the summary which imply that NOSENKO was lying about his knowledge of
the case, Tuere is adequate reason to believe that NOSENKO exaggerated
his own 1962 role in that NOSENKO now states he was to.give assistance
to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV in the handling of BELITSKIY in Geneva
in 1962 and rot to suzervise ARTEMOV.

‘The more important aspect and the primary one is the difference in
“what NOSENKO specifically reported about the BELITSKIY case and infor-
mation from the actual CIA record of the case. There are major difier-
ences and without going into all the details of the case which is very involved,
‘an effort has been made toward determining whether these apparent differ-
ences necessarily indicate that NOSENKO was or is lying or whether there
is a possibility he is relating the actual KGB version of the case.

NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY was a KGB agent whom

American Intelligence recruited in London in 1960 or 1961 and that the
6001223 .
6

SEG


KGB purpose in running the operation was to lure American Intelligence
into meeting BELITSKIY inside the USSR. Tae previous summary stated
that NOSENAO did not know when the BELITSXi. operation started

(Brussels, Belgium, 1958}, did not know the nature of the British

involvement, cid n-t know the operational details and contact arrange-
ments BELITSKIY. had with CIA, and did not know BELITSKIY's pattern
of activity in Moscow or Geneva.

NOSENKO during current interviews has indicated an awareness
that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use
BELITSKIY against the British. However, he still has dated the recruit-
ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in Loadon and still states that the
primary purpose of the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in
contacts with BELITSKIY within the USSR, The latter was considered
completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSKIY was recruited in
Brussels, Belgium, in 1958; that three letters had been mailed to
BELITSXIY in the ussR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY
had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR.

There are at this time sufficient unresolved questions in the
BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis-
erepancies between the statements by NOSENKO on the BELITSKIY

case and the actual record are a reflection against NOSENKO, i:

the other hand, there is some reason to believe NOSENKO has

furnished the actual KGB version of the BELITSKIY case and that the
KGB, at least as of 1962, did not know the true story of the relation-
ship of BELITSKIY with CIA, There is a distinct possibility the
KGB believed the BELITSKIY recruitment occurred in 1961 in London
and BELITSKLY did not then nor has he since admitted to the KGB
iis association with GIA actually started in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium.
As a possible reason why BELITSKIY would have told the KGB in
1961 a partial story of his contact with American Intelligence, some
at present unknown event may have occurred in 1961 which caused
BELITSKIY to believe his security was endangered and ae a result
he told the KGB of certain events in London in 1961, relating these
events as being the original approach to BELITSKIY by CIA.

The following are certain of the points which suggest the KGB
actually considered that BELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in London

?
in 196] and that BELITSKIY may have never told the KGB of the
developments in his case prior to 1961:
(a) BELITSKIY was in London in April 1960 at which
time he was in contact with a British citizen who was also”
reporting to MI-5. This individual reported information

received from BELITSKIY which may have been a lead to

6001225



13-00000

George BLAKE. (It seems highly untikely the KGB would

ever have directed BELITSKIY to jurnish information which

may have been a lead to George BLAKE, or at least could

have caused the employees of the unit in which BLAKE was

employed from June 1959 to August 1950 to come under

suspicion a6 having. passed information to Soviet Intelligence.)
(6) NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY, aiter he went

to Geneva in 1962, managed to reinitiate contact with CIA

rather quickly because he met a girl he had previously known

whom he was sure was an American Intelligence agent and

that she must have reported his ee in Geneva to American

Intelligence. (Ii the BELITSiIY case had been controiled by the

KGB from its inception in 1958, the KGB would have known of

the internal mailings to BELITSKIY and the fact that BELITSKIY

had a cover address Saas the Soviet Union through which to

initiate contact. However, if BELITSKIY did not tell the KGB

anything about his contacts with CIA prior to 1961 and then

gave only a partial story of what happened in London in 1961,

BELITSKIY would not have told the KGB of the internal mail-

ings to BELITSKIY in the USSR or the fact that he long had

a cover address outside the USSR. BELITSKIY therefore

As previously indicated, the conclusion is there are a sufficient’

number of unresolved questions in the BELITSKIY case so that discrep-

ancies between information {:0m NOSENKO and the actual record in the
BELITSKIY case cannot at present be comsidered as a reilection against
NOSENKO, andthere is a distinct possibility the KGB actually did not
know the true facts of the BELITSKIY case.

The previous summary noted on page 106 that-Nataliya SHULGINA
was an Intourist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO in 1955, It also
noted that NOSENKO had stated Boris BELITSKIY “reported to the KGB
that CIA had warned BELITSKIY against SHULGINA," The previous
summary stated BELITSKIY reported to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB
agent and "CIA did-not warn BELITSKIY,"

There appears to be no doubt at this time that the statement by
NOSENKO that BELITSKIY reported the "CIA had warned BELITSKIY
against SHULGINA, "is a reasonably accurate description of what actualy
happened in May 1962 during Agency contacts with BELITSKIY in Geneva.
The record reflects that BELITSKIY stated SHULGINA had confidentially
told him of her status as a KGB agent, stating she had been doubled by
the KGB after having been forcibly recruited by American Intelligence

whik previously in Paris, France.

6001228

ll

13-00000

It was determined there was no collateral information which
would indicate that the statement by SHULGINA had any factual basis
and BELITSKIY was warned SHULGINA may have been acting on behaif

I + of the KGB in stating to BELITSKIY she had been “forcibly recruited by
American Intelligence" at a previous date. It was also suggested to
-BELITSKIY that he should go to the KGB ar a loyal Soviet citizen and

report the apparent indiscretion of SHULGiNA.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary, in connection with
the BELITSKIY case, made reference to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV.
It was stated that ARTEMOV had been involved with a series of America:.

tourist agents in the Soviet Union and although NOSENKO was allegedly

familiar with ARTEMOV, he was unaware of the involvement of ARTEMOV

i 2 with American tourist agents in 1958 - 1959, The summary noted this

-was during a period when NOSENKO claimed to have been Deputy Chief
3 of the American-British Commonwealth Section of the Seventh Depart-
ment, Although not specificaily stated, the above suggested ARTEMOV
was actually in the Seventh Department in 1958 - 1959 and that NOSENKO
was not even aware ARTEMOV was in the Seventh Department. NOSENKO
hae consistently stated that ARTEMOV was assigned to the First Section,
First Department, from the time he entered into the KGB in approxi-

Jv) mately 1957.

A closer examination of the cases cescribed in the previous

reveals there is no c

summary.as "CiA American tourist agents,
flict in the involvement of ARTEMOV in these cases and the statement
by NOSENKO that ARTEMOV was with the First Section, First Depart-

ment, As anexample, one of the cases is the case of Edward McGOWAN,

NOSENKO has furnishe:

information concerning this case, stating it was
originaliy a Seventh Department case and that after the mailing of a letter .
by the individual in Minsk, the case was immediately taken over by the
Firet Department, There is adequate reason to believe ARTEMOV only
became involved after the case was transferred to the First Department.
Another of the cases involved the contact of ARTEMOV with E
32 ty,
and visited the USSR on a teurist visa. Such an individual would under
no circumstences be considered a true tourist or the responsibility of
the Seventh Depariment, particuiariy since apparently the individual was
even traveling under a diplomatic passport. it is, assumeé the individual
was oi interest to the First Chief Directorate and if the First Chief
Directorate required or desired support from ihe SCD, it would normally
request the First Department for such assistance and it is extremely un-
likely that the FCD would request the Seventh Department for assistance

ina case involving an American diplomat.

Pages 332 - 333 of the previous surnmary contain the basis
for the previous conclusion that the claim of NOSENKO that he was a
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department from July 1962 to January
1963 was not credible, It is considered that a detailed rebuttal is
not necessary since this conclusion was apparently based on inadequate
information. During current interviews, NOSENiO has furnished
details concerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position
which substantiate his claim to kaving been a Deputy Chief of the
Seventh Department from July 1962 to January 1964,

An example in support of the statement that the previous conclu~

gion was based on inadequate information is the matter of the writtea

notes which NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 1965.
The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is
inadequate, inaccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews,
an effort had not been made to obtain from NOSENKO a detailed expian=
ation of his notes or of how he obtained the information in the notes.
During current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed iniorma-
tion concerning ail aspects of his notes. This information supports his
claimed position of Deputy Chied of the Seventh Department and includes
collateral support to his claim of being Deputy Chief of the First Section,
First Department, in 1960 - 1961.

Primariiy the notes of NOSENAO can be categorized as
follows: i
(a) Short case summaries dy the Chiefs of the : i

First Section, Second Section end Sixth Section, Seventa

Department, NOSENKO has stated that he was in 1962 -
1963 responsibie for supervision over these Sections end
that Filip Denisovich BOBKOV, Deputy Chief, SCD, wbo
supervised the Seventh Department, requested a list of all

recruited agents of the Seventh Department. According to

i
i

NOSENKO, the order from BG3KOV was to only retain the

tt

files (cases) of agents in tourist firms and that the files of

other recruited agents should be sent to the FCD or Archives.

NOSENKO has stated that ne im turn levied on the Chiefs of
the three Sections the requirement of BOBXOV, but also ex~

panded the request to include all 1960 - 1962 cases, not

excluding previous cases or cases which had already been
given to the FCD. The notes of NOSENKO included hand-
written reports from the Chief or Acting Chief of each Section
on recruited agents, with information varying from agent to
agent and even including some human errors.

Many of the above cases had previously been trans~

ferred to the FCD, but the remarks of NOSENKO abou tein 04232

5



inclusion support his statement that he had expanded

the original request from BOBKOV so that he would have
some “pieces of information to give CLA."

(b) Notes by NOSENKO on other cases which he learned
of during the 1962 - 1963 period. Certain of the notes were
made from a review of a notebook kept by the Chief, Seventh
Department, to which NOSENKO had access on at least two
occasions. Most of his notes were not detailed but were
sufficient to refresh the memory of NOSENKO at a later
date and yet were somewhat innocuous to maintain before
his defection,

(c) Notes for lectures to officers of the Seventh Directorate
prepared while with the First Department, 1960 - 1961, and
the Seventh Department, 1962 - 1363.

(6) Draft report for the briefing of the new Chief, First
Department, in the latter part of 1961. .
{e) One of three copies of an unregistered report pre-
pared by the Chief, Seventh Department, and two Deputy Chiefs,
including NOSENKO. This was a briefing paper for use by the

Chief (CHELNOKOV) in an appearance before the Collegium

of the KGB which was reviewing the activitieu of the Seventh
ie 6001233

-SEGREF



13-00000

Department, According to NOSENKO, the prepared

report was never typed as a formal cocurnent.

The view has been set forth that NOSENKO took undue risk in
carrying written notes with him out of the Sovict Union, An examination
of this material suggests that NOSENKO was using extreme care in
collecting material and was not attempting to obtain documents, the
possession of which might be incriminating or which if he had brought
out would have been immediately missed, Instead, he collected a con-
siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with
little or no fear that a search of his effects in the KGB aiter his depart-
ure for Geneva would disclose that certain material was missing. None

of the material was registered and all could have previously been des-

‘troyed by NOSENKO.

The previous summary stated that NOSENKO brought three KGB
documents to Geneva, These were typed papers but none was registered

or actually accountable, The reference to three documents was to:

) The draft report for the briefing of the Coliegium
which has been mentioned previously.

(b) A typed two-page report on several cases, Actually
a Chief of Section had typed his notes on cases instead of

submitting in handwriting as the others did,

document end did not contain the usual information as to

number of copies typed.

G, NOSENKO is no vi.

d_ claim to certainty that the KGB

recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and his

defection in 196%. (Previous conclusion)

The conclusion in tiis summary is that NOSENKO is oi the

n that there were no KGB recruitmenis of United States Embassy

personnel in Moscow between 1953 and December 1963 with the exception
of "ANDREY" (Dayle Wailis SMITH) and Herbert HOWARD, who actually
was [24 prrteree but did work part of the time in the Embassy.

The question here is whether or not the expressed opinion of
NOSENKO is sufficiently based on actual knowledge 60 that this opinion
can be accepted as absolute evidence that there were no other KGB

recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time, The

that the opinion of NOSENKO cannot be
accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, there is a possibility that
a recruitment could have occurred and NOSENKO not be aware in any
way of the recruitment, This should in no way be interpreted as a
suggestion that NOSENKO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased
observer without personal knowledge could and should be hesitant to
accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO in this particular area.
The actual basis for the stated opinion of NOSENKO. she ld be

Gu!

examined and can be cited as follows.



{a) During March 1953-late May 1955 NOSENKO

was 4 case ocificer in the First Section, First Department,
SCD, NOSENKO does noi claim that he would Lave known.
the detaiis concerning any recruitments (other than
"“ANDREY") in this period, but states if there nad been
ke would bave heard "sometiing.

(b) During late May 1955 to December 1959 NOSENKO
was in the Seventh Department, not the First Department,
but continued to have contact with certain officers in the
First Section, First Department. NOSENKO is of the
opinion that if there had been a recruitment in the United
States Embassy during this period he would have heard
"something" even though he would probably have learned
few details.

(c) During the January 1960-December 1961 period
NOSENKO was Deputy Chied of the First Section, First
Department, and he has made the categorical statement
that there were no recruitments by the KGB of United
States Embassy personnel during this period of time.

He has also stated that if there had been any recruitments
during the 1953-1959 period he is sure he would, during
1960-1961, have heard or learned some details of tht}()1 238

NOSENKO since the Chief of Section was Vladislav

KOVSHU& who had been an officer of the First Depart-
meni since 1953, actually working in the First Section
except Zor the periods of time that he was in the United
States to reactivate "ANDREY" in 1957-1958 and a
period of time that he was Deputy Chief of the First
Department, ;

{€) During 1962-1963 NOSENKO was again in the
Seventh Department, However, he continued to maintain
contact with certain officers of the First Section, First
Department; in particular, Gennadiy I. GRYAZNOV,
who succeeded NOSENKO as Deputy Chief of the First
Section, then became Chief of Section, and in the latter
part of 1963 became a Deputy Chief of the Firet Department,

According to NOSENKO his relationship with
GRYAZNOV was sufficiently close during 1962-1963 that
he is sure GRYAZNOV would have furnished NOSENKO
some information in regard to any successful recruitments
of United States Embassy personnel. NOSENKO pointed
out that he learned of the existence of the Herbert HOWARD
case from GRYAZNOV in 1962, although it wae not until

1963 that NOSENKO heard the name. NOSENKO actually

learned of the name when the First Section, First
Department, needed the services of the Seventh
Department (Third Section) in obtaining a room {n 2

ae

In genaral the above constitutes the basis for the stated opinion
: of NOSENKO that "ANDREY" and Herbert HOWARD were the only
successful KGB recruitments during 1953 - December 1963. It should
be noted that there are no other identified KGB recruitments during
this pertod of time which would specifically refute the opinion of

NOSENKO. However, in view of the cited actual basis for the opinion

esses geeeecee eneteeeeeeseatentenpessssesnqesessetovesg erie ten eeeeeveeneenseeereeeseesentrnespeenoseoe

of NOSENKO, acceptance of the opinion of NOSENKO as being an
honest opinion should not be converted into 2 statement that it is
absolute proof that another recruitment could not have occurred,
NOSENKO may te completely correct in his opinion, but since
NOSENKO wae only in the First Department 1953 - 1955 and 1960 - 196) H
his opinion that he would have heard “something” about a recruitment

in 1953 - 1959 or 1962 - 1963 tannot be accepted as infallible.
