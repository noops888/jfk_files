INTRODUCTION

The following summary and analysis is not intended to be

all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi-

zational, operational, personality and case type intormation furnished

by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO. To aitempt to do so wouid be repetitious

and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the

formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of

primary concern.

This summary will not contain a detailed psychological

assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain a recitation of the numerous

theories which have been promulgated in the past concerning varying

aspects oi the NOSENKO case. This summary will be primarily

directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was not

dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career is relatively

plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been cooperative in

a reassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO

has admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that

these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance

-SECRET

but not to mislead tois Agency in any material matters of an operational

or policy nature.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding oi ibe phrase "bona

fices" as considered in this summary. NOSENiO will be judged primarily

on whet..: he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB kno.riedge.

and whelder his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with representatives of this

Agency were known to ibe IGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent

aspects will be considered, but his admitted previous errors, lies and

exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a

"uuna fide" defector.

There is not an accurate standard or scale of measuremen:

against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or

correlated io determine il he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer. For

purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas

considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may difier in regard to

whether this arbitrary siandard is a completely accurate standard, but it

is felt inat the information from NOSENKO and information from otner

sources derived through independent investigation will permit the reader

to assess the information in toto against any standard he considers

appropriate.

The previous summary on NOSENKO entitled, "The Exami-

nation of the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector, " has been considered in

SUMMERY OF DEVELOPVENTS IN NOSENKO CASE

SINCE 30 OCTOBER 1967

Since 30 October 1967, interviews with Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

have been conducted by one individual not previously known personally to

NOSENIO but who bas been aware of the NOSENXO case since June 1962.

Intervicws have been detailed and very extensive in scope, have

been recorded and transcribed, and have covered the entire life and caree.

Of NOSENKO without regard to whether a particular aspect had been

covered during previous interview or interviews.

NOSENKO, although naturaily apprehensive during the firet few

interviews, has been cooperative, has developed a relaxed atitude, and

the interviewer has noted no significant reluctance to discuss any aspect

of his life, career, or activities. On occasion NOSENKO has indicated a

reluctance to make positive statements in certain areas previously

considered at a minimum extremely controversial. This reluciance

was understandable and when it became apparent to NOSENKO that the

interviewer would not dispule co disparage his statements without adequate

reason, this reluciance on the purt oi NOSEiXO, in the opinion oá the

interviewer, totall; disappcared.

During the interviewing period, pariicularly in the cirst sir monine,

¡OSINKO materially assisted ine interviewer by preparing approximately

sixty memoranda on such diverse subjects as his lie, motivation ior de-

jection, individual cases, noies which he furnished to CLA in 1904, KGB

organization, and KGB officer and agent personalities. As an example

of the scope of this work by NOSENKO, four of the memoranda included

remarks concerning approximately 875 KGB officers, 100 KGB agents,

35 GRU officers, and 400 other Soviet nationals. These lists were alpha -

beticaliy arranged and the above indicated cooperation oi NOSENKO has

materiaily assisted in the orgarization and evaluation of iniormation

furnished by him during current interviews.

Copies of transcripis of interviews with NOSENKO and relatec

memoranda have been disseminated to the FBi and the Cl Stali. Special

Agent Eibert Turner and Special Agent James Wooten of the Washington

Field Office/FBI in particular have given great assistance in research

and compilation of new or additional information and the FBI has inter-

viewed or reinterviewed a number of United States citizens concerning

whom NOSENKO has furnished pertinent information.

ANALYTICAL COVIVENTS CONCERNING THE BOXA FIDES OF

YUR!Y IVANOV:CH NOSENKO

As indicaied in the itroduciion to this summary, incormation in

regard to Yuriy ivanovich NOSENiO will be considered against an arbi-

trary but realistic list of areas considered vertinent to the question of

whether NOSENKO voluntary defected to lins Agency without KGB

knowledge, and whether his 1962 and early i904 contacts with represer!.

atives of this Agency were known to the KGB.

It was noted thai motivation and certain other pertinent aspects

would aiso be considered bui that his admitted previous lies and exag-

geraiions wouid not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is not a

"bona fide defector."

The following is a list of the areas considered pertinent and which

are being given specific consideration. Attached is a separate section

containing remarks in regard to the designated areas oi A - H.

A. Is NOSENKO identical to tre person waom he claims

to be?

B. Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible?

zation reasonably commensurate with his claimed KGB

E. Can the irformation iurnished by NOSENKO be con-

sidered in toto as having resulted in material damage

to the KGB and/or has the information furnished by

NOSENKO been of significant benefit to Western Intelli-

gence?

F. Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in

information furnished by NOSENKO nich would warrant

a conclusion that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB?

G. is there evidence of a political or any other type objective

which could justify a dispatch of NOSENKO by the KGB

with permission to speak freely to CIA concerning his

A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims lo be?

During interviews NOSENKO has furnisaed detailed information in regard

to his family, his activities as a youth, ine schoois he attended, assoc-

iates of his father and rother, and his own associates. The period

under consideration in this section is int period preceding his entry

into ine First Department, Second Chiei Directorate, ViVD, in mid-

March 1953.

Information furnished by NOSENKO concerning his father and

mother and his early life, together with other information such as a

comparison of phoiographs ul NOSENKO and a photograph of his father

and confirmed travel of his mother to Western Europe in 195ó with

Madame KOSYGINA, conclusively establish that he is Yuriy Ivanovich

NOSENKO, the son of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, the Minister of Ship-

building in the USSR prior to his death in 195ó. This is also satisiactorily

supported by personal-type information furnished oy NOSENKO concern-

ing other associates of his father and motner.

Since, as indicated above, there is considered to be no doubt

that Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO is the son of the former Minister of

Shipbuilding, a detailed study of his life prior to 1945 (age 18) is of

MOSENKO. An expose of his youlniul indiscretions, of nich re sas

admitted a number, is oí no import in a discussion of whether NOSENKO

was or was not dispatched bi the #GB. Obtaining any coilaterai first-

hand injormation in regard io NOSENKO uciore 1945 would be oi

negligible value, but there actually is supporting iniormation from

NikoLay ARTAVONOY, a delecior iron the Sovict Nary, concerning

the claimed attendance by NOSENKO at a military-naval preparaiory

school in Leningrad.

NOSENKO, during current interviews, has stated that he grad-

uated from the Institute of International Relations in 1950 and had

attended the Institute since 1945. He has explained that he shouid have

graduated in 1949 since it was a four-year course, but failed the final

examination in Marxism and iherefore was required to attend the institute

sor a longer period of time arc again take his final examinations.

Based on iriormation furnished by NOSENKO concerning co-

studenis and the Institute, there is no reason to douot inat he acruaily

attended and graduated from the Institute oi International Relatiors in

1950. The previous controversy in this matter was complicated by

NOSENKO who, in 1964 after his defection, stated in a biography that

he had graduated from the Institute in 1949. Actually this statement

by NOSENKO in 196% resulted in conilicting information since NOSENKO

on 9 June 1962 during his first contact with CIA had stated that he

"completed toe Institute of International Relationa in 1950. " NOSENKO

has given the explanation that he changed the date of his graduation to

1949 because he did not wish to admit that he had ailed to graduate in

1949. NOSENKO explained that this change in his date of graduation

caused him to pre-date his actual entry into Navy Intelligence to 1950

instead of 1951 and his aciual entry into the KGB from 1953 to 1952.

The abore action by NOSENKO is included in what NOSENKO has

characterized as his "stupid blundera." The latter is a rather apt

characterization of his now admitted lies and exaggerations but is not

evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. It is evidence oi

a certain personality trait of NOSENKO who has in the past by his own.

admission tended io enhance his importance and astuteness by graphically

portraying his personal participation in KGB activities concerning which

he had knowiedge but did not personally participate.

The claimed service of NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence during

March 1951 to early 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas has been

seriously questioned in the past. Specific comments on this period of

considered that the recent interviews oi NOSENKO satisfactorily sub-

stantiate his claimed service in Navy Inteiligence during March 1951

Attached is a typed copy of a handwritten memorandum completed

by NOSENKO on 31 October 1967. This is a biographical statement con-

cerning his life and KGB carcer. No effort has been made to correct

grammatical errors or speiling since to do so would be in conflict with

the manner in which current interviews were conducted; namely, to give

NOSENKO an opportunity to recuunt his life and activities to permit a re-

examination oi the entire case. The comprehension and fluency of

NOSENKO in the English language was adequate for interview purposee

in October 1907 and both have matcrially improved since that time.

interviens of and memoranda prepered by NOSENKO since

• 31 October 1967 have not indicaled any material discrepancies with the

siatemerts of NOS EINiO in the altached memorandum. One change tiat

has been niade by NOSENKO is that he now dates his transfer from the

First Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, to the Seventh

Department, SCD, as occurring in the latter part of May 1955 rather

than June - July 1955 as indicated in the attached statement. NOSENKO

neither of the above changes are considered to be of a significant nature.

An effort has been made during current interviews to differentiate between

In summer 1945 there was created the institute of the inter

national relations in Moscow and in July I entered in this institute.

In uly my father went in Germany with the group of engineers

and he too‹ me (1 received à temporary tanis of a senior lieutenant,

documenis and a unilorm).

In 1945-1950 I studied at the institute. In 1946 I acquainted

with à girl - Sitiror FLAVIA, stuient of the medicine inbire. I

was in close Ii:.! ona with this girl, because of the pregnancy i married

her and she maic an abort. My parents were against the marriage and

we did not live together and we soon divorced. In the end of 194ó I was

acquainted with Telegin AUGUSTINE and was going to marry her, re-

ceived a flat in 1947 (Si. Mira - former Ist Uecychekad, 162/174). In

• November her father, Generai TELEGIN, was arrested, but I married

her. The marriage was not successiul. I foundout about her close

relations with the brother, and ihe child-giri was born with patnological

changes.

I was not the father of this child. After that I broke with ner

and we were living separately (end of 1948 - beginning 1949).

In spring 1950 before state exams in the institute was working

of State Security). Bu: MGB did not accept me. After that with the

help of the father I began to deal with the personnel department of the

intelligence of the ministry of mililary navy concerning my future work.

Passing state exams I failed Marxism-Leninism and with a

group of fails I was passing state exams once more. In October 1950

I finished the institute and received a diploma.

I was accepted in the navy intelligence in the 13 of March 1951

and in March 17 went by a train to Soviet Harbour (intelligence of 7in

Fleet, as an interpreter of the information department). Before going

to the Far East I began my divorce with the former wife.

At the end of April 1952 i went on a leave in Moscow. Immediately

alter returning in Moacow I had a blood cough out. Il the middle os May

I went to a tuberculous sanatorium not far from Moscow. in July I

finished my treatment and returned in Moscow. Because of the health

I could not return back to the Far East and the personnel department oi

the navy inteiligence seni me to Baitic Sea (as a senior interpreter oi

the navy intelligence poirt of the intelligence of 4th Fleet - in Sovietsk,

Kaliningrad's district).

In September-October i952 I received a rank of licutonan..

In Sovietak the work was not interested and for me it was nothing

to do. Besides this the cia te was not good for my health and I decived

to change the job. With : purpose beiore new year at the end of 1952

I took a leave and went to Moscow. January l I was with my parents

at the evening party at the cottage of General MGB KOBULOV, whom I

did not know before, but I knew his son-in-law Vahrushev Vasili - a

former stucent and my friend. I lold him about my job and that now 1

was thinking about change of the job. KOBULOV was speaking with me

on this theme and propose we work and his help in MGB, but nothing

more definite was said about my work. This month I reported to the

incad of the personnel department of the navy intelligence KALOSHIN

about my decision and that I will be working in MGB.

In the end of January I went again in the tuberculous sanatorium,

where I was in 1952. In the days of funeral of STALIN I has come to

Moscow and visited the ministry where my father was working. There

I have seen General KOBULOV who has come to the father and he said

that he would settle my question concerning my job. After several days

past the theory has been advanced that NOSENKO was never an officer

ing the KGB, particularly the Second Chief Directorate, ias been so

extensive as to invalidate any contention that he was not a KGB officer.

It is considered that NOSENKO was a KGB officer in ine claimed

Departments curing the claimed periods of time and served in the claimed

positions in each Department. It is interesting to note that NOSENKO has

not materiai; varied in his statements in regard to the above since his

original contact in June 1962 (with the exception of his change to 1952 as

date of his eniry into the KGB and then later reverting to the date given

in 1962). There have been some variations in dates of a minor nature,

as indicated elsewhere in this summary, but these are of month or day

of transfer irom one Department to another and not considered critical

or evidence oi deception. NOSENIO has admitted previously giving false

information in regard to rank and medals, but his basic story concerning

his KGB career today is not significanily different from the fragmentary

version he gave in June 1962.

Basically the following is now considered to have been the KGB

career f NOSENKO:

Mid-March 1953 - late May 1955, Firat Section,

First Department, SCD

Late May 1955 - December 1959 (1958 - December

1959 - Deputy Chief of Section) Seventh

(NOIE: The term Deputy Chief is being used throughout this

summary, but the better terminology probably is "Deputy to Chief."

The position of "Deputy Chief" in United States Government parlance,

including CIA, is not synonymous with the term "Deputy Chief" as used

in Soviet organizations and more specifically in the KGB. As an example,

a Chief of Department in the KGB or the Chief of a Residentura abroad

may have 2, 3 or even 4 deputies, one oí whom is

given the titie oi

First Deputy. This particular deputy acts in the absence of the Chief

of Department and in generi: has supervisory functions over all the

Department sections.

The cception to the latter is when the Chie of

Department retains direct supervision over what he may consider ine

most imporiant section. Other deputies have supervisory functions only

over designated sections or organizational components. )

During current interviews and in prepared memoianda, NOSENKO

has furnished detailed information which it is considered substantiates

his claimed positions in the KGB. Detailed remarks on these topics are

contained in separate sections of this summary.

It is realized that GOLITSYN, although confirming that NOSENKO

was a KGB officer in both the First Department and Seventh Department,

SCD, has stated that NOSENKO remained in the First Department until

circa 1958 and that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief oi the First Section,

First Department, in 1960. It is impossible to correlate this information

with the above indicated opinion that NOSENKO left the First Department

in late May 1955 and was Deputy Chief of the First Section, First Depart-

ment, in 1960, nor is an adequate explanation of these variances available

it this time. On the other hand, it is not Icasonable that NOSENKO

would lay claim to ine litie of Deputy Chief oi the Firsi Section, First

Department, l this were noi true when he cicarly knew of the visits oi

GOLITSYN to the Firsi Section in 1960 - 1961 and of his conierences

with officers ciosely associated with NOSENKO at that time.

NOSENKO has aiso mentioned & number of officers di the SCD

or former cilicers of the SCD who transferred to the FCD with wiom

he was personally acquainted and who were also known to GOLITSYN.

A number of these officers were officers from whom GOLTSYN has

stated he obtained certain information or through whom he became aware

oi certain activities inciuding Viadislav M. KOVSHUK, Gennadiy I.

GRYAZNOV, Vladimir Ivanovich PETROV, Yuriy I. Guis, Vladimir

A. CHURANOV, Y'ergeni; GROMAKOVSKIY and Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV.

The statemont of NOSENKO that although he had heard of

GOLITSYN he had never personally met GOLITSYN, stands in conflict

with the statements of GOLITSYN that he, GOLITSYN, had met and

ralied with NO NKO in the SCD in the late 1950'5. The description

of GOLITSY vi iris meeting is that of a casual encounter in the halis

rather than a specific office visit. In light of this, the absence of any

reason why NOSENKO from his point of view should remember such

an encounter and the absence of any reason for NOSENKO to lie on this

0001046

## Page 48

13-00000

issue, it is eminently reasonable to conclude that the encourier took

place but that NOSENKO simply has no recollection oi it, merc is

no reason to attach sign cance to this lapse of memory.

The previous opinios thai NOSENKO did not noid the claimed

wition oi Deputy Chiei, First Section, First Department, Guring 1960 -

190% has had the most me.: in the controversy over his statements

reiative to his KGB carces. This particuiar aspect will be covered in

detail in another section, but of note at this time is the controversy

over what duties the position of Deputy Chief oi Section in ine SCD, KGB,

entails or does not entail. Il is a fruitless exercise to attempt to judge

whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chief oi the First Section in 1960 - 1961

on the basis of wether his knowledge of the toial activities si the First

Section was commensuraie with the knowledge of a Deputy Branch Chief

in CIA in regard to the activities of the entire Branch.

Whether NOSENKO was a Depuij Chief of Section in ide SCD,

KGB, must be judged on the basis of what were the duties oi a Deputy

Chief of Section in the SCD and in particular what were his duties in

the particular assignment. The organizational structure of the KGB

may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure

of CIA, but any similarities are surely not such as to permit a judgment

Ei.c

as to wnether NOSENKO heid a certain claimed position on the basis

of a comparison oi his activities and responsibilities with that inherent

in a somewhat similar position in CIA.

One of the most important difierences between United States

agencies or organizations, inciuding CiA, and the bureaucratic structure

of agencies or organizations in the USSR, including ine KGB, is the

salary structure. Pay oi a KGB officer is based on military rani and

on actual position heid with an additional percentage increase for longevity

and language qualification. Actual position held is important from a

monetary vievpoint in addition to the prestigc. As an example, ine

difference in montaiy

salary between a captain and a major is iserty

rubles and the dilference in salary between a Senior Case Officer and

a Deputy Chief of Section is also twenty rublus. An increase in miitary

rank alone has limited pay advantages, as for example a Lieutenant

Colonel who is oruy a Senior Case Officer receives less pay than a major

• C. Fias YOSENKO given an acceptable explanation of nis

motivation in contacting Cil in 1962 and for his deiecsion in 1904? Of

the cigat listed categories waich are being given specific consideration

in the matter of the bona fides of NOSENKO, this category is probably

the most difficuit in which to present a logical position with actual

support. There are too many intangible aspects involved and altaough

motivation is an important factor, full resolution of the motivation

problem is not a paramoun: factor in deciding whether NOSENKO is Or

is not a dispatched agent. NOSENKO could have contacted this Agency in

1962 and defected in 19u% without KGB knowledge and yet even at this late

dato have failed to disclose some important events oí a personal nature

which actually were important ingredients in his ultimate decision.

Defectcis are humans and have at least the normal reluctance to admit

unfavorable informaiion weich they consider of a personal nature.

On 31 October 1967 NOSENKO, following a request, furnisned a

handwritten memorandum on the topic of his motivation, a typed copy of

which is attached. The memorandum, although not grammatically correct,

is quite understandable and is worthy of review. The tenor of the memo -

randum is one of increasing disillusionment with the Soviet regime.

NOSENKO and others of his generation have lived in a Soviet society

throughout their entire lives. The envizorment is an importani factor

of influence in

the life of an individual and irue disillusionment is at

best usually a graduai process in vich, many factors, some recognized

and some not recognized by ine individual, save played a role in varying

degrees.

NOSENXO, until 1955 ard possibi; until the death of his iather

in August 1956, could be compared io the profligate son of wealihy

parents in the United Staies who linally graduates from college and obtains

employment perhaps in the firm of his father without actually earning any of

the luxuries be has enjoyed. The faiber of NOSENKO was not only wealthy

by Sovici standaris bui also held a diga government position. The

influence of his fatcer and the name di dis iater undoubtedly was an

important if not the must imporiani lacior in NOSENKO even being

permitted to enter the Naval RU and the XG3 even though NOSENXO is

particularly reluctani to admit, perhaps even to himself, that this was

the primary reason.

The above should not be construed as any reflection on the

actual intelligence of NOSENKO, but rather as an explanation of how

NOSENKO could have even entered the Naval RU and KGB. His

periormance in both prior to 1956 by his own admission was such that

be probably would have been summarily ierminated ii he had not been

the son oi tue capable, respecied Minister oi Shipbuiiding.

Lí a certain amount of speculation is permitied, ibe

disiliusionment o1 NOSENKO, who iost many personai advantages

following the death of his father inciuding a personal automooile, may

have actually started soon after the leach of his fatner. That NOSENYO

is undisciplined is supported by his acmissions relative to his life in

the USSR and his behavior both in 1962 in Geneva and for a period oi time

after his defec ion in 196%. NOSENKO was addicted to women, liguor. and

the material things which can be purchased with money or obtained through

influence.

A question has been previously raised regarding his motivation

in contaciing CIA in 1962, particulazly his statement that he needed money

and would sell "two pieces of information." NOSENKO das stated that he

wanted to make a contaci with the Americans, that de vas not emotionally

ready to defect, but thai he subconsciously believed inai if he made a

contact he wouid be making an ultimate commitment from which he could

no longer retreat.

NOSENKO has stated that he gave considerabie thought to the

beat way to contact the Americans so that he would be believed and not

rejected and came to the conclusion that he would offer to sell some

information. NOSENKO staied that he thought if he approached the

Americans stating he was a "KGB counterintelligence officer who wanted

to give information, " he would not have been believed and would have

been peremptorily rejected. NOSENKO stated he had difficulty deciding

how much money to ask for and how to make the approach, but finally

decided to do it inrough Dawa VAnis whom the KGB considered was with

American Intelligence.

The above statements by NOSENKO are not in conflict with the

record. NOSENKO did offer to sell "two pieces of information, " almost

immediateiy gave more information, made no significant demands for

morey, and in fact his price for "two pieces of information" was

ridicuiously low by American standards. NOSENKO has during current

interviews stated, as he first stated in 1962, that he had spent excessive

amounts of money in one or two riotous evenings. However, NOSENKO

has during current interviews staied that he could have covered his

expenditures by other means without receiving any money from the

Americans.

Operational Memo # N-4

SUBJECT: NOSENKO, Yuri Ivanovich

The following is a typed copy of a hundwritten memorandum

furnished by Subject on l November 1967, foilowing a request on

31 October 1967:

What were the motif and the reasons which have led me to

the decision to breake with the Soviet Russia? The only definite is an

understanding of the situation in the Soviet Russia, the knowledge of

the methode of the communist regime,

the knowledge of the real foreign

and interior policies of the Soviet government and the laith in the right

nese of the iree world.

It svas not a decision which was accepted or could be accepted

in a month or a year. This decision was slowly growing in me. I

think that the beginning was in the studentship.

Living with my parents and being in the circles of the parent'e

and my acquaintances I knew more then there was written in newspapers

and periodice and that was propagandized by radio and TV. Working in

the Far East and later being in trips in different regione and cities of

Russia I found out much better the life and conditione of the life of the

people of the Soviet Russia,

## Page 58

13-00000

When I worked 1l years in MVD-*GB i understood and found

out very many things, detaile and the rcal deal of the existing regime,

about methods

of the work of MGB-MVD-KG3 and about their doings,

about hundreds of thousande of the pcople of Russia who were (and

still are) considered "politically" dangerous and around whom was

(and atill ic) going an active wori of all organs KGB.

At the same time when I was scveral times abroad I have

seen personally the so-called "decay" at the West. I have seen in

reality how is living people.

Several times when I was abroad I was thinking about staying

at the West and not returning in Ruasia, but only one thing was keeping

me - my family.

In 1962 in Switzerland I made the acquaintance with the

Americans.

From my part "the sell of the information" was a real

show. I was thinking that they wouid not beiieve me otherwise. In

that period of the time there was going a big struggle in me to stay

abroad of to return home till the last days of living in Geneva and even

when I was returning home in Vienna.

In 1962-1963 1 decided definitely that i did not want and could

not live more in the Soviet Russia. In this period of time I have done

all my best to go as soon as possible abroad.

D. Is the iniormatior furnished by NOSENKO to CIA concerning

KCB operations, personalities, and organization reasorably commen-

surate with his claired KGB career? The conclusion is that the infor-

mation furnished by NOSENKO concerning KGB operations, personalities,

and organization is more than reasonably commensurate wiin nis claimed

career in the KGB from mid-Varch 1953 to his defection in early February

1964.

In reaching the above conclusion, consideration has been given

to his claimed departmental assignments and claimed positions in each

department. Certain allowance has been made for lauily memory with

consideration being given to whether there is any indication of deception

or whether the fauure to recali a particular item oi interest can logically

be attributed to the vagaries of the human mind. There is, oi course, no

accurate standard oi measurement which would permit a positive deter-

mination as to whether inability to recall certain deiails or events is

actually due to the fact that the human mind cannot recall all past events

or could be attributed to willful deception.

An efíort has been made to determine if there are any particular

patterns or areas where NOSENKO has indicated he did not recali

specific matters or certain details, and no pallern or specific areas

have been noted. NOSENKO, in iact, has an

unusually good memory

as evidenced b; the extensive iniormation iurnished by NOSENKO purely

from recollection, In adcition, there has been no material reiuctance

on the part of NOSENKO io discuss his entire life, KGB officers he has

known, KGB organization and procedures, or other topica di nièrest.

NOSENKO has furnished considerable detail concerning KGB

officers whom he has inown at various periods in his entire KGB career.

He has been very consistert in information furnished and has frequently

added certain details which he recalied at a later date.

Certain remarks will be made in another section in regard to

the volume and scope of information furnished by NOSENKO. This in-

formation is nol sciective, out is ad excellent indicator that NOSENKO

was assigned to the First Depariment and Seventh Department, SCD,

during the claimed periods of time and neld the claimed positions. Con-

sideration has been given to his various claimed KGB assignmente in

evaluating the information iurnished in an effort to assess whether his

indicated knowledge was commensurate with his claimed position during

a particular period of time or suggested the possibility that he did not

occupy ibe position wnich he claimed to have heid.

It is consicered thai iniormation furnished by NOSENKO supporta

his claimed positions in the SCD. It has not been possible to substantially

confirm tarough collaieral sources that NOSENKO srived in bis claimed

positions. Neither has it been possible to obtain from other sources an

applicable description of the duties or responsibilities of an individual

holding any of the positions NOSENKO claimed to have held after 1958. It

is feit there can be no question that NOSENKO served in the capacities of

junior case officer, case officer, and senior case officer during 1953 - 1957.

As regards the duties and responsibilities of a Deputy Chief of Section,

Chief oi Section, and Deputy Chief of Department, and whether NOSENKO

held these various claimed positions, a considerable amount of personal

judgment bas been necessary. This personal judgment has been nade in

as judicial a manner as possible, with full knowledge that any opinion in

regard to the above is largely dependent upon information from NOSENKO.

NOSENKO has compiled detailed diagrams of the actual offices

he claims to have occupied and surrounding offices curing the four pri-

mary periode of time: 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -

1963. He has prepared specific memoranda concerning his co-officers

and other personnel, ard chunges of persorrel, as well as diagrars

of the oifices of the Chiai and Deputy Chiefs of the SCD during 1956 -

1964. This material is internally consistent. Furthermore NOSENKO

could not possibly have known that this detailed information could not

immediately be checked for accuracy, at least in part, with a source

or another officer who has defected since mid-1964. li these diagrams

and memoranda were not relatively correct, NOSENKO, who is quite

astute in matters of counterintelligence, would hardly have voluntarily

prepared the material in such detail. This ype of information is

peculiarly adaptable for analysis by a knowledgeable source or by another

defector and could, if not relotively correct, permit a rather positive con-

ciusion that NOSENKO was lying of fabricating information.

NOSENKO has furnished quite specific information on KGB

operations during te 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1950 - 1962, and 1962 -

1963 periods of time. As migat be expecied, his specific inowledge is

Less for the 1953 - 1955 period; but his own personal situation and attitude

until 1955 - 1956, which are mentioned elsewbere, should be given

consideration. In any event, be has furnished adequate information so

that his claimed assignment during 1953 - 1955 is considered sufficiently

substantiated even though his actual job periormance undoubtedly

deserved a low rating.

The knowledge of NOSENKO concerning cases, KGB operations,

and other officies can consistenily be related to his claimed department

and position assignmeni during the 1953 to January 1964 period. The

scope of his inowiedge of his own department when considered in toto

is broader after 1957 than before, which is compatible with his claim of

increased responsibilities. His knowledge of the work of otber departments

of the SCD irom the late 1950's on is also more extensive, which is aiso a

further indication that NOSENKO actually beld the claimed positions

during this period of time.

F. Is there evidence of KGB decestion or "give away" in

incormation furnished by NOSENKO which wouid warrant a conclusion

that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KCB? The conclusion in this

summary is that NOSENKO was not dispatched by the KGI. In

reaching this conclusion, a full examination of the above " ion has

been both a necessary and integral part.

It is inherent that the volume of information furnished by

NOSENKO is only one of the factors which should be given consideration

in arriving at a conclusior thât NOSENKO was or wäs not dispatched by

the KGB. Il NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, the KGB would have

surely been willing to sacrifice certain information of value to the iGB

in order to support the bona fides of NOSENKO. However, if NOSENKO

was dispalched, it must have been to accomplish or iurther a KGB

purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be

unknown.

An examination of the circumstances under which NOSENKO first

contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his behavior during these contacts is

particularly pertinent since during this period of time NOSENKO would

have surely been under direct KGB control i there are any implications

of KGB dispatch in the NOSENKO case.

NOSENKO has staied that his original approach to "sell iwo

pieces of information" was his own idea as to what was most likely to

be successful. NOSENKO has stated that he wanted to make a contact

with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the

time, and felt that if he merely stated that le was a "KGB counter-

intelligence officer who wanted to give information," he very possibly

would be rejected. It should be noted that NOSENKO even during his

first contact did not limit his remarks to the "two pieces of information"

and began to talk quite freely on other matters.

IL NOSENKO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 1962

contacts, would have beer very carefully brieied and that his remarks

or statements would have not been of a nature which could cause any

suspicion in regard to the bona fides cí NOSENKO. Instead, a current

review of his statements and remarks during his five contacte in 1962

indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and actual lies were quite

likely typical of a braggadocio element in the personality of NOSENKO

and may also have been evidence supporting the statement by NOSENKO

that he usually had a few drinks of liquor before each contact in

Geneva.

NOSENKO, during his five contacis in Geneva, made many

statements wnich in retrospect were impossioie, and the investigation.

of which could only have raised ceriain questions con arning NOSziKO.

The following is a list of the more obvious areas in nich NOSENiO

made gross exaggerations or mace incorrect or impossibie statements.

(a) NOSENKO claimed he personally was with

Oleg M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the SCD, during the

recruitment gitch to James STORSBERG. (This was

a lie and an interview with STORSBERG with display

of photograpi would have disciosed inat JOSENKO

did not participate. )

(0) NOSENKO was involved in the recruitment

approach to Russell LANGELLE. (This was a lie and

LANGELLE was available for interview.)

(c) NOSENKO said he recruited LUNT (riorace

LUNT) in Bulgaria. (Actuaily NOSENKO never met

IUNT.)

(d) NOSENKO claimed personal contact with Edmund

by the KGB. (NOSENKO actually had never personally met

STEVENS and oniy had seen STEVENs once at a distance.)

(e) NOSENKO dated the recruitment of "ANDREY"

in Moscow as 1949-1950. At ihe same time he furnished

information that "ANDREY"' ¡vbo is considered identical to

that Roy RHODES, also a recruited agent, was assigned to

Moscow, 1951-1953. "ANDREY" (SMITH) was actuaily in

Moscow 1952-1954.

(5) NOSENKO said be, GRIBANOV, and anoiser officer

met Edward Ellis SMITH. (NOSENKO has since staied he did

not meet SMITH and that his only role was obtaining a foreign

typewriter and paper for a KGB agent involved in the SMITH

operation. )

(g) NOSENIO in a number of instances spoke in the

first person, saying "We did this, " or "We did that, " in

reference to a particular KGB activity in which he now admite

he was not involved but had some knowledge. (I

NOSENKO was under KGB control in 1962, both he

and the MiGB should have known that these indicated

exaggerations would eventually lead to a question

concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO.)

In 19ó2-1963 a number of similarities were noted between

information furnished by NOSENKO and information which had been

furnished by GOLITSYN prior to June 1962. These similarities were

quite striking and gave riseto certain suspicions of NOSENKO because

he provided information which the KGB would presumably have considered

already compromised as a result oi the defection of COLITSYN. Certain

of the similarities ai the time could only be explained in terms of

NOSENKO being a dispaiched agent. The following are some examples of

the similarities noted.

(a) Both furnished information in regard to

Johan PREISFREUND.

(b) Both furnished information in regard to a

military code clerk case (James STORSBERG).

(c) Both furnished information in regard to a

trip of Vladislav KOVSHUK, under an assumed name.

to the United Staies. (GOLITSYN was sure it was

assumed name which KOVSHUK usca. )

(a) Both furnished information in regard to

microphones in the United States Embassy in Moscow.

(e) Both furnished information in regard to

Edmund STEVENS and Isaac Henry SHAPIRO.

The above list is not compiete nor does it indicate the actual

differences in the amount of information furnished on any partic diar

topic by GOLITSYN and NOSENKO. To cite the above in detail in leis

summary is believed unnecessary since the only point of real interest

is whether the fact that NOSENKO was aware of certain events, cases,

or situations of which GOLITSYN was also aware raises a legitimate

question concerning the bona fides o NOSENKO.

The above area of concern has been thoroughly examined and

it is considered that the fact that NOSENIO furnished some informasion

on certain cases or situations previously mentioned in lesser or

greater detail by GOLITSYN cannot logically be construed as evidence

that NOSENKO was dispaiched by the KGB. NOSENKO has during

current interviews satisiaciorily sourced his information in alir.: st

overy instance. in a few insiances he has said he dia not recali

how he learned of a particular piec. oi information but these

apparent lapses of memory were not large in number and are

considered to be in no laj suspicious.

The general area in which there was a similarity between

information furnished by GOLITSYN in late 1961 - early 1962 and

information furnished by JOSENKO in June 1962 and which would have

been the most significant insoíar as the security of the United Staies

Government was or is co-cerned relaica io certair activities centering

around or in the First Department, SCD.

It is the conciusion of this summary that NOSENKO was an

officer of the First Section, First Depariment, SCD, during 1953-1955

and was Deputy Chief of the same section in 1960 - 1961. Therefore,

the fact that NOSENKO furnished information concerning certain cases

or situations in the Firs: Depariment and the fact ihat GOLITSYN

furnished information concerning the same case or situation is not

unusual or necessarily suspicious. NOSENKO has stated that GOLITSYN

been noted and commented on in another section of this summary.

GOLITSY, has furnished certain iniormation which he re-

ceived from officers of the First Section, First Department, SCD.

In each instance where this information, which was fragmentary, couid

not be immediately correiated with information from NOSENKO, it was

previously considered to be evidential i deception of lying on the part

Of NOSENKO. This position, however, failed to allow for the possibility

that the discrepancies between the two sources were, at leaet in certain

instances, more apparent than real.

In certain instances it has now beer possible to correlate irag-

mentary information from GOLITSYN with information from NOSENKO,

making it evident that in these instances the differences could not be

construed as in any way reflecting against NOSENKO. The four examples

cited below represent two probable correlations, (a) and (b); one possible

correlation, (c); and one instance where no correlation is possible at this

time, (d):

to Moscow so that further work could be undertaken to

effeci her recruitment. Fie did not recall the name of the

referred to by COLITSYN. However, SCHWARZENPACH

was not a female secretary in the American Embassy, but

had been employed as a secretary to the wife of Ambassauor

BOHLEN during 1955 - 1956 and from 1958 - 1959 was employed

as a correspondent by the United Press in Moscow. The

recruitment attempt against SCHWARZENBACH, according to

NOSENKO, occurred in 1959 and was an operation of the Firs:

There is considered to be a good possibility that

GOLITSYN actually learned of the above information from

GRYAZNOV in early January 1961 when he was again in Moscow

rather than during the spring of 1960 when GOLITSYN was

preparing ior lis assignment to Helsinki, Finland. This

theory is supported by information on page 163 of the previous

summary that GOLITSYN has stated he learned in January

1961 from Vladisiav M. KOVSHUK (Chief of the First Section)

that Johan PREISFREUND had recently been used in the

successíul recruitment of an American employee oi the

Embassy.

Johan PREISFREUND was used in the STORSBERG

aware that GOLITSYN had a conversation with KOVSHUK about

PREISFREUND since GOLITSYN wanted to use PREISFREUND

in Heisinki. NOSEYKO has stated he was not present during

the above conversation. It is very possibie that KOVSHUK

exaggeraied a littie in his conversation with GOLITSYN in tie

matter of why GOLITSYN could not use PRE'SFREUND as an

agent.

NOSENKO has furnished extensive irormation in regard

to the James STORSBERG case and with due consideration to

tie accuracy and recoilection of GOLITSYN, there does noi

appear to be an adequate basis for questioning the bona fides of

NOSENKO on the basis of the differences between the report-

ing by GOLITSYN of information he received from GRYAZNOV

concerning what is considered to have been the James

STORSBERG case and detailed information furnished by

NOSENKO concerning the James STORSBERG Case. The

exact date of the recruitment aîtempt against STORSBERG

(c) Page 163 of the previous summary contains

information from GOLITSYN wnich he had received from

GRYAZNOV in April or May 1960 that an American

employee of the Embassy in Voscow was either recruited

or prepared for recruitment on the basis of a homosexual

compromise beginning in 1959 and concluding in 1960.

The previous summary also states shat according to

GOLITSYN, the KGB had photographed the American in

various homosexual acts, but SHELEPIN, who had just

become Chairman of the KGB, was at the time stressing

iceoiogical rather than biacimail recruitments. SHELEPIN

aid not exclude future use of the photographs which the KGB

would hold in reserve.

NOSENKO has furnished information concerning the

homosexual compromise of Robert BARRETT, who was a

guide at the United States Exhibition in Moscow in 1959, and

with whom "SHIMELEV" and "GRIGORIY", two homosexual

agente oí NOSENKO, became acguainted. Work against

the United States Exhibition was the responsibility of

the Ninti Depariment, SCD, but various Departments

were participing under he direction of the Ninth

Department.

One of the above homosexual agente succeeded in

involving BARRETT in homosexual activities which were

photographed by the KGB but, according to NOSENKO,

although the photographs were of a good quality, the KGB

was unable to use the photographs in 1959 because of a

general ban by the Central Committee on the recruitment

of the United States Exhibition guides due to the planned

visit of Presidert EISENHOWER to the Soviet Union.

NOSENIO also stated that the compromising material

and information on BARRETT was later given to the First

Department and that BARRETT was recruited by the Second

Section, First Department when he returned with another

Exhibition in 1961, and that he, NOSENKO, was not involved in

the recruitment operation. BARRETT, following his return

to the Unied Staics in January 1902, confessed to the

FBI that he had been recruited in 19ó1 on the basis of

compromising photographs which had been taken

during his 1959 trip to Moscou.

Although it cannot be established at this

time, it is possibie that the information furnished

by GOLITSYN which he had received from GRYAZNOV

actually refers to the Robert BARRETT case. It should

be noted that Robert BARRETT could not actuaily be

characterized as an "American employee of the Embassy

in Moscow."

(d) Page 162 of the previous summary conia ins infor-

mation from GOLITSYN that in the spring of 1960 when he

visited the First Section, First Department, SCD, he learned

from GRYAZNOV that GRYAZ.\OV had as an agent an Embassy

code clerk who was scheduled to be transferred io rielsinki.

GRYAZNOV indicated to GOLITSYN that the code clerk had

already furnished the KGB with some inforration, that he was

considered by ine XGis to be a "real" agent and that ii

the transier of the code cierk materialized, GOLITSIN

might have the code cleric as an agent in Helsinki.

NOSENIO has furnished no information which ca. be

correlated in any way with the above information from

GOLITSYN, bui neither has the information from GOLiTSYN

resulted in an identification despite the considerable investigation

which has been conducted in the matter. Although this is

considered to be a valid lead, it need not necessarily reier

to a code clerk who was in the United States Embassy in

Moscow during 1960 - 1961. I: is also poesiole thai the previous

remark by GOLITSYN concerning the above "code clerk" who

might be transferred to Helsinki as well as his cited remarks

in a-c could be clarified or ai least additional information

obtained if a specitic reinterview on these matters was possible.

The trip of Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki, Finland in

November 1960 should be mentioned in any comparison of information

from NOSENKO with information from GOLITSYN. This conflict is

to accompany an Ámerican Embassy code cieris on the train to

Nioscow and that KOSOLAPOV pianned io sirike up an acquaintance

with the code clerk which could be continued in Moscow.

The American Embassy code cierk referred to above was

undoubtedly John GARLAND and the train manifest lists John GARLAND

and Viktor KOLOSOV (Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV) as passengers on the

same train from Heisinki to Moscow. NOSENKO is aware of the

identity of John GARLAND but claims no knowledge of the above trip

Of KOSOLAPOV to leisinki, although being well aware oí a previous trip.

NOSENKO, as Deputy Chief of tae First Section specifically

charged with work against code clerks, shovia have been aware oi ine

November 1960 trip of KOSOLA?OV to and irom Helsinki. His lacis of

knowledge may or may not be explainable in terms of his other activities

such as his trip to Cuba in November-December 1960 but it cannot be

interpreted as evidence NOSENKO was dispaiched by the KGB since, if

he had been, the KGB should have briefed NOSENKO on the trip of

KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki in November 1960, as thie was an event sce

KGB knew GOLITSYN was aware of.

A theury which has previously been given consideration and

Warranted fui consideration was that il NOSENKO was dispaiched,

his mission was io confuse leads furnished to American intelligence

ard/or io ¿enigraie tue vallie oi information furnished by GOLiTSYN.

In connection with this iceory, it should be noied inat NOSENKO during

current interviews has noi made any remarks which could in any way

be construed as derogatory to GOLITSYN. In addition, NOSENKO does

not claim to have any detailed knowledge of the FCD and frequently,

when some topic peculiar to the ICD bas been broached with NOSENiO,

his immediate reply has been io the elleci that "I didn't work in the ECD,"

or "You shouid ask GOLiTSYN about thut."

In connection wiil any consideration of whether lae contact of

NOSENKO with CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have been initiatea by

the KGB as a result of tine defection of GOLITSIN, the timing oi certain

events should be noted. GOLITSYN defected os 15 December 1961.

NOSENIO deparied from Moscow in March 1962 for Geneva, Switzeriana,

where he remained until 15 June 1962.

It is felt that it would have been practically impossible if not

impossible ior KGB officials to complete an assessment of the actual of

potential damage which could result from the dejection of GOLITSYN.

was dispatched by the KG3, it would appear that pians ior this would

have predated the defection of GOLITSYN and inat any GOLiTSYN

aspeci could only be a clated aspect and not the basis for ine original

plan to dispatch NOSENKO. In audition, if NOSENKO was dispatched.

it would hardly seem necessary for ike KGB to send NOSENKO i

Geneva two and one-half months before his first contact with CIA.

The theory has also been considered thai NOSENKO could have

been dispatched to confuse and divert American inteiligence and taus

to protect an important KGB penetration or penetrations of the United

States Covernment, particularly CA. This is a ineory which should

and has been given full consideration, out it is noi possible to factualiy

substantiate or refute this ibeory in the absence of specific information

that high-level KGB penetrations do or do not exist.

Actually, as regards NOSENKO, the primary area waich should

be given consideration in the above matter is if all the information from

were no recruitments of American personnel in the United States Embassy

in Moscow from 1953-December 1963 with he exception of "ANDREY"

(Dayle Wallis SMITH) and Herbert HOWARD. The basis for this

expressed opinion of NOSENKO is consiered eleewhere in this summary

and analysts may differ as to whether a recruitment could have occurred

of which NOSENKO did not have knowledge, assuming that his statements

are made in good faith, it shouid be noted, however, that at this lime

there is no specific incormation which is in direct conflict with the

expressed opinion oi NOSENKO.

NOSENKO, as previously mentioned, has never claimed any

particular knowledge of ECD activities.

In addition, he does not claim

to be aware of all recruitments of Americans by the SCD.

against members oi deiegations, ioreign businessmen, foreign studenis,

mainly of a collateral nature.

NOSENKO does not even claim any detailed krowleúge oi

nor does be claim to know all of the cases of which the Chief of the Seventh

Department was aware. The latter is specifically supported by certain

notes brought out b; NOSENKO which are short references to a number

o! Seventh Department cases which are identified only by the KGB code

name. These notes, according to NOSENKO, were made when he had an

opportunity to review a notebook beld by the Chief of the Seventa Department

and constituta the only knowledge NOSENKO had of these particuiar cases.

HI. Is there ar; evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO in 1902

or in 196s with CIA vere known to ine CB prior to his ¿cfection or

that NOSENKO was ever briefed by the KUB relative to his behavior

or KGB objectives during these contacis or alter his aclection? The

conclusion is that there is no evidence that ice contacts of NOSENKO

in 1962 or in 1964 with CIA were inown to the KGB prior to his

defection and that NOSENKO was never brieled in any manner by the KGB.

The basis for ice above conclusion is substantially contained in

previous sections. It is being treaied bere as a separate area of interest

since it is a sulficiently important area as to warrant individual consideration.

It is recognized thai since positive factual confirmation suci as

the KGB file on NOSENIO is not available, any conclusion concerning

whether NOSENKO was of was not dispatched by the KGB can only be

based on the full review of availabie indormation from NOSENKO,

collateral sources, independent investigation and the opinion of the

individual analyst concerning the significance or non-significance of

each item of available information.

The conclusion that the contacis of NOSENKO with CIA in 1962

and 1964 prior to his defection were not known to the KGB is

0001107

SECRET.-

## Page 110

necessarily based in pari on a judgment as to whether any of his

activities or information logically varrant a substantial suspicion

that they were or could be in any part the result of KGB direction

or control. One of the particular areas considered was his apparent

bchavior during his contacts with ClA in June 1902 and the conclusion

was that it was incomprehensible that he could have been under KGB

control at that time.

Consideration has been given to the possibility that his 1962

contacts with CIA were not known to the KGB, but became known to

the KGB later and NOSENKO was doubled by the KGB. it was con-

cluded that there was no basis for or information which would warrant

serious consideration of tie above possibility aside from the separate

conclusion that the KOB wouid be very unlikely to reward a traiter in

KGB eyes by sending him again to Geneva where he would be quite free

to defect.

Worthy of comment in this section is the fact that NOSENKO,

during his 1962 contacts, expressed considerable concern over his

personal security, requesting that knowledge concerning his identity be

kept to an absolute minimum, that no communications be sent to the

primary conclusions concerning the claimed Naval RU (Navy Intelligence)

and KGB Career of NOSENKO. These conclusions or findinge are

independently treated in separate attachments.

With the exception of "G," the conclusions in lais summary are

in direct conflici with the above conclusions and are basically that

NOSENKO served in the Naval RU from March 1951 to early 1953, was

• a KGB officer from March 1953 until his defection in Februazy 1964,

and held his claimed positions in the KGB during the Narch 1953 -

February 1961 period.

PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS RE NOSENKO

AS CONTAINED ON PAGES 357 - 360 OF

"THE EXAMINATION OF THE BONA FIDES OF A KGB DEFECTOR"

The foliowing is a quote of the previous conclusions in the case of Yuriy

Ivanovich NOSENKO. (T'ne specific conclusions have been fire ine designation

of A - G for purposes of easier correlation with otier sectiona vi this summary.)

"SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S 30%1 FIDES"

"NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in

successively senior positions of aunoriy from which he derived

extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and results of KGB

operatione against Americans in the Soviet Union in the period

1953-1963. To substantiate his claim, he provides an impressive

array of information about KGB personnei, organization and opera-

tions which, to the extent that it has been confined, is preaumptive

evidence of his bona fides. Various Soviet oificials, including

intelligence officers, have generally corroboraied NOSENKO's

claims. According to some of these sources, NOSENKO was a

senior KGB officer who occupied a series of sensive positions, who

0001114

---

## Page 117

13-00000

enjoyed considerable autority and trust despite personal short

coming., and whose acfection, 'the gicatest loss ever suffered

by soviet Intelligence', paralyzed lie work of em kGß eas

• Legal Residency, and justified the formulation oí plans to assas-

sinate him."

"The examination has compared each element of NOSENKO'e

biography relerant to his claimed KGB service with known

facis and reasonable surmise. The examination reilects the

test to which his accounts were pul: whether his accounte are

internally coherent and consistent with known fact, and whether

he actually gained the information de has from occupying the

KGB positions he claims to have heid. In short, is he what he

says he is, according to his own accounts?"

"This examination had led to the ioilowing findings, arrived

at independently:

A. NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU

in any of the capacities or at the places and times he

claimed.

B. NOSENIO did not enter the KGB in the

manner or at the time he claimed.

C. NOSENKO did not serve in the American

Embassy Section througaout the 1953-1955 period as

he claimed.

C001115

•...

D. During the period 1955-1960, ie was neither

a senior case oilicer in, nor Diputy Chiti of, the Seventh

Department Amnezican-British Commonwealth Section.

E. NOSENKO was neither Depuly Chief of ine

American Embassy Section nor a senior officer or

supervisor in int Section during the period 1961-1902. (sic)

F. NOSE,XO's claims, that in 1962 se was Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section and was

thereafter a Deputy Chief of the Sevenin Department, are

not credible.

G. NOSENKO has no valia ciain io certainty

that the KGB recruited no American Embassy personnel

berveen 1953 and his defection in 1964.

Inese lndings difier somewhat with respect io degree of probability

or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance of avaiiable evidence

in each instance. "

"The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive evidence

OÍ NOSENIO's bora fices. The contradictions in NOSENKO's accounts

of his life and KGB service are so extensive as to make nis claims

as a whole unacceptabie. While truth and fact in this case frequently

G001116

## Page 119

cantot se establisned with certainty, it is evicent that truth and

laci are not what NOSENKO reites. By ahnosi any test, virtually

any of NOSENXO's above claims are impugned by jaci or provability,

or coniradicted or retracied in his own stalements. NOSENKO is

nor what he claims to be, and thus he is not a bora lice deíector."

"Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is not a bona fide

dejector, it is necessary to attempi io determine his true motives

for contacting American inielligence and for providing the iniormation

he has given. Here, it must be recognized that the evidence, largely

consisting of NOSENKO's own assertions, does not permit unequivocal

conclusions. Neverheiess, the question cannot be ignored. The

character of ine information NOSENKO nas conveyed, ine fact that

some of his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet officials,

and the necessity to maxe decisions about NOSENKO's future ali

require that at ieasi a provisional judgment be made. "

"Of the reasonable explanations advanced ior NOSENKO's

misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a swindler posing

as a former KGB officer for reasons of personal advantage; that he

suffers from a deranged personality or unbalanced mind; that he has

greatly exaggerated his actual rani, status and access in the KGB, for

simply personal reasons; or, finally, that he is a dispatched KGB

agent. "

"The first iwo possibilities are casily dismissed. That

NOSENKO is not simply & swindler woo falsely claims for personal

advaniage to have been à KG3 officer is cvident, we believe, rom

tne confirmed details of KGB organizaiion, persornel and operations

which he has provided and wiich couid only derive from within the

KGB itself. "

"Second, as noted in ine text, extensive psychiatric and

psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out the

possibility that NOSENiO's actions and testimony are the product

of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind."

"It is somewhat more plausible inat NOSENKO is a KGB

officer who served in at ieast some of the components for some

or all of the time periods that he ciains, bui wno greatly exag-

geraier his positions, rank and access to intormation, and

invented some matiers outright, io achieve greater status with

American Intelligence. This explanation, however, fails to

accommodate tre fact thai several KGB officers have asserted

that NOSENKO did in fact nold senior positions in the KGB. Also,

NOSENXO's assertions with respect to his rank, GRIBANOV's

patronage, the recall telegram, and the like, cannot be justa

product of his own invention, since these were the subject of

comment by other sources. "

"Because none of ine above explanations is consistent with

the data developed in inierrogations and investigations, we are

left with lie hypothesis inat NOSENKO was dispaiched by the

KGB. Whiie this e planation does not reconcile all the anomalies,

none of inem renders it untenable. "

"In tne absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or

other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that the

evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was dispatched

by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires that he be

regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and that his infor-

mation should be abscssed accordingly. "

1. NOSENiO did not serve in tie davai RU in any of the capacities

or ai the places anci times he ciaired. (Previoua conclusion)

The above is conclusion "A" in the previous summary in regard

IC NOSENKO. The current conclusion is that tre claimed service of

NOSENKO in Navy Inielligence (Naval RU) during March 1951 to early

1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas is adequately substantiated

and should be accepiec.

The interrogations of NOSENKO prior to 1967 were complicated

by NOSENKO changing the date of his graduation irom the Institute of

International Reiations irom 1950 to 1949 because he dia noi wish to

admit that he had failed io graduate in 1949 with the majority of his class.

However, previous ejoris of NOSENKO to revert to his original 1962

statement that he graduaied in 1950 were not accepted and an unwarranted

significance was given to the 1949 - early 1953 period oi time.

It is considered that NOSENXO has adequately explained his

"stupid blunders" as they relate to the above and to certain other personal

matters and that his claimed service in Nary Intelligence from March

195i to early 1953 boü in the Far East and the Baltic area is fuliy

accepiabie. I is not considered necessary to comment concerning all

oi the remarks in the previous summary regarding the claimed Naval

RU service oi NOSENKO as

reilecied on pages 49-59 and remarks will,

for purposes of brevity, be limited in scope.

The statement is made in the previous summary that "The sole

Headquarters RÜ officer NOSENKO identified was the Personnel Chicí,

Colonel KALOSHIN. He identified no ranking officers in either the Baltic

or Far East Inteligence Staffs. Some 30 GRU officers he did identily.

by his own admission, IOSENIO knew not from his Naval RÜ service,

but through social acquainiance, later, in Voscow, or through his visits

do Geneva."

Altached is a copy oi a handwritten memorandum voluntarily

prepared by NOSENKO in late 1967 containing the names ci a number

of GRU personnel of whom ie had some knowledge. The attached was

not prepared as the result of any inquiry concerning his claimed Naval

RU service, but was only a small part of the material prepared by

NOSENKO at this time. The entire material included remarks by

NOSENKO regarding approximately 875 KGB oilicers, 100 KGB agents,

35 GRÜ officers and 400 other Soviet nationals.

It is interesting to note that the altached list contains the names

oi approximaiely 20 GRU oificers whom NOSENKO relates to the cariy

1950's period. In addition, NOSENKO has, during current interviews

and in other memoranda, furnished the names of additional Navy Intelii

gence personnel whom he know in the 1951 - carly 1953 period.

Page 52 of the above summary an other related pages question

wnether NOSENXO ever served in the Baltic area with Naval Intelligence

and even question his geographical knowledge of the area. Attached is a

copy o: a handwritter memorandum with certain diagrams prepared by

NOSENKO on 21 February 1968 concerning his assignment with Navy

Intelligence in the Far East and the Baitic area. The memorandum was

compicted by NCSENKO without any reierence material and a review of

his diagrams indicates they are quite accurate.

NOSENKO had previously stated that his service in the Baltic

area was at Sovetsk Primorsiiy and during current interviews recailed

that the former name of the place, an aimost deserted fishermen's

village, was Fishausen. The previous designation given by NOSENSO

for this place as having the mail address of Sovetsi Primorskiy had

caused the conclusion that his alleged place of assignment was non-

existent. A further check in the matter would have disclosed that the

place was not nonexistent, that it is currently known as Primorsk and

that the former German name of the fishing village was Fischhausen.

The previous summary aiso siated that despite his claimed

Soviet Nary iradition, doctrines, or orgarization of procedures, It

souid be noted that there is a considerable difference between being

a member oi the Naval iU and being an actual member of the Soviet

Navy.

The situation could be compared to a carcer civilian empioyee

B. NOSENKO did not inter the GB in the manner or at the time

claimed.

(Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "B" in the previous summary in regard

in NOSENKO. The conclusion in this summary is that NOSENiO catered

the then Second Chiei Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his

entry was not only facilitated by but due to the influence of General

Bogdan Zakharovich KC3JLOV.

Previous statements by NOSENKO and changes relative to date of

entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section of the summary

and will not be repcated here. His statements during current interviews

that he entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a case officer in the First

Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, are

con-

sidered adequately substantiated and should be accepted.

The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) that

NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed

was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSENKO as to when

he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in

1965 NOSENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.

in 1964, NOSENKO had given to daies in 1952 as dis time oi entry into

the KGB in an elort not to aumit that he had failed to graduaie from the

Institute of Internacional Relations in 1948.

The previous summary gave considerable weight io the statemente

OÍ NOSENKO indicating ihai he disi not enter the KGB (VVD) under what

are considered normal KGB procedures. Proper allowances were not

given for posicion of the fairer of NOSENKO, ine Minister of Shipbuilding,

and the influence of General KOBULOV. An analyst can either accep. or

reject the statement of NOSENKO that he entered the KGB (MVD) through

the influence oi General KOBULOV; but, if the statement is accepted, then

the failure of NOSENKO to be required to follow normal KGä procedures

should also be accepted. A Communist society or a Soviet intelligence

organization is not and could not be immune to influence by a bigh oificial.

the Minister of the then MVD.

The previous summaiy raises

several points concerning the

eligibility of NOSENKO for the KGB (MVD). It points out on page 67

that other than his undistinguished period of service with the Naval RU,

he was no more eligible for a KGB appointment in 1953 than he was at

the time of his previous rejection in 1950. This statement is not contro-

vertible and is fully accepted with the qualification that in 1950 NOSENKO

was not spondored by any person of influence as was the case in 1953

¿O BERIYA.

The previous summary also siates that according to KGB

dcícctors familiar with the siandards in iorce at the time, no cancidate

was accepted who had ever had tuberculosis.

This is a flat statement

which it is doubiíul any defector or series of defectors could fully

substantiate; namely, that it never happened. Until and unless it is

medically proven that NOSENKO did not have tuberculosis, it is accepted

that he did have tuberculosis in 1952 and was at a sanitarium -- rest.

piace in Kubinka. It is also accepied that he was an officer in the KGB

after mid-Varch 1953. The influence of KOBULOV could undoubtedly

have permitied NOSENKO to enter the KGB even though he previously

had tuberculosis, but the flat siatement inat no candidate was accepted who

had ever had tuberculosis is not and cannot be sufriciently substantiated.

The previous summary contained a number of additional remarks

and conclusions intended to snow that NOSENKO was not eligible for and

therefore could not have entered the KGB (MVD). Comments concerning

these wiil be brief since there is considered to be no adequate basis at

this time on which to contend that NOSENKO did not enter the KGB

(MVD) as an officer in mid-March 1953. A comment was made that

3

NOSENKO did not take a physical examination in connection wit his

processing ior KGB entry, and that such a medical examiration was

a routine and mancaiory part of the processing of a KGB candidate.

This staierent makes no allowance for the influence o! General

KOBULOV; but, in addition, docs not consider the faci that the Navai

Rü dossier on NOSENKO was available to the KGB (MVD).

The previous summary also failed is note that ine MVD wouid

have rad independent iniormation in regard to NOSENXO since ine MVD

would have conducied any necessary inquiry in connection with the entry

of NOSENKO into the Naval RU. As of 1953, the MVD undoubtediy also

had a dossier un the father of NOSENKO since this was still the STALIN

era.

The summary

also states that NOSENKO did nor compiete the

necessary jengthy Anketa before entry into the KGB (iVVD) and did not

speax to any personnel officers or visit the personnel office. it would

seem that the influence of General KOBULOV could have permitted the

elimination of most if not all of the necessity of complying with normal

procedures, but NOSENKO has during interviews stated that he com-

pleted the Anketa while sitting at his desk after entry into the KGB (MVD).

Page 70 of the previous summary states that NOSENKO did not

know the designation of his own Directorate either at the time he allegedly

STALiN died in carly Varcia 1953 anc that same month the

MVD and the MCB were merged under the name WVD with BERIYA

as Minister. BERIYA held this position until his arrest in early June

195j. BERIYA was succeeded by KRUGLOV, who held office for less

than a year. Yuriy RASTVOROV was recently queried concerning the

date of the reversal of the designation of the FCD and SCD and places

it as the erd of April or early May 1953. GOLITSYN has indicated itai

the change occurred "soon after ine aúvent of SERiYA as head oi she

MVD in April 1953. " In the light of our inability to fix the electivé cate

of the reversal of the designations of the SCD and the ECD, it is

unreasonable to impugn NOSENKO on his statement as to the designation

of his Directorate at the time of his entry into the KGB (MVD).

There is a disagreement between NOSENKO and others as to who

was responsible for the reversal of designations of the FCD and the SCD.

NOSENKO is of the opinion that it occurred under KRUGLOV, which is

C. NOSEYKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section

throughout she 1953 - 1955 perica as he claimed. (Previous conciusion)

The above is conclusion "C" in the previous summary. The

conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO was an officer of the First

Section (American Embassy Seciion), First Department, from mid-Varch

1953 to late May 1955 when he was transierred to the Sevenin Department,

SCD.

This period of time has beer. covered in detail with NOSENKO

during curreni interviews. The conclusion is that NOSENKO was an

viticer in the First Section but was not a very effective officer and that

both his works and behavior were decidedly influenced by the fact thai he

was the son of the Minister of Shipbuilding. NOSENKO is rejuctant to

admi: that he was other than slightly lackadaisical in his work curing

this period of time, but is not hesitant io admi: that his persoual be-

havior was such as to cause him to be removed as Secretary to the

Komsomol unit in 1954 and to cause an unsatisfactory "characterization"

to be propared in early 1955 which necessitated a decision as to whether

he would be fired irom the KGB of transierred to some other component.

The induence of his family is quite appareni in the above sirce

" nis father was advised of his difficulties in 1954 by an oilicial of the

KGB and his mother inierceded on his behalf in 1955 with the Chies of

SCD. The result in 1955 was that NOSENKO was transferred to the

Seventh Department ard not fired from the KGB.

The question has been raised as to how JOSENKO could remais

in the KGB when after 1954 be was not a member of the Komsomol and

was not eligible to become a candivate for the Communist Firty. This

is a valid question but a plausible explanation is again the fact that he was

the son di the then Minister of Shipbuilding.

NOSENKO has stated during previous and current interviews ii:

Jollowing his entry into the KGB and until circa mid-1954 he was respon-

sible for work againsi American correspondents in Moscow. He has nos

claimed that he had any successes and has stated that the work with news-

paper correspondents already recruited was being handled by other oificers.

NOSENKO has explained that during this time he was a "new officer, "

indicating be could hardly have been expected to act as an experienced

officer. His knowledge of correspondents in Moscow during this period

of time, together with his knowledge of other KGB officers and his

6001141

information concerning his own ajents is believed of suificient weight

to accept tne statement of NOSENKO that work against American coi-

respondents was his assignmen irom mid-Varca 1953 to mid-1554.

From circa mid-1954 until his transfer to ine Seventh Depart-

ment in late May 1955, NOSeNXO ciaims and has claimed be was an

officer of the First Section with loe responsibility of work against the

Vilitary Attaches (Army) at the United Stales Embassy in Moscow. It

is considered, based on his knowledge of she various Military Aitache

personnel and oiher coliatera; irformaiion furnished by NOSENXO, that

NOSENKO was an officer of the First Section during the mid-1954 - late

May 1955 period of time, that his primary work was against members

of the Oilice oi the Military Attache, but that the quality of his work

undoubtedly left much to ve desired.

In circa mid-1954; NOSENXO was removed as Secretary of the

Komsomol unit and by early 1955 his performance was such that at least

certain officials in the First Department desired his removal from the

First Department, if not the KGB. Under these circumstances,

NOSENKO could be criticized as having been a very 200r if not

undesirable KGB officer, but his knowledge of the First Section during

this period of time and hia knowledge of the members of the Office of

the Military Aitache supporis the claim oi NOSENKO toat he was an

oilicer of the Firs; Section wiüh the indicated assignment ab related

by him.

NOSINXO has siaied that the work against the Military

Attaches was noi primarily directed toward developmeni of recruitment

possibilities, but was direcied toward control of the Military Attaches

on trips in order to prevent observation of sensitive areas, sensitive

sires or sensitive activities in the USSR. This attitude by the KGB

would appear to be compietely plausible and NOSENKO noted as

excepsionzi in tois regard the recruitment attempt against Captain Waiter

MULE. NOSENKO explained this exception as retaliation for approaches

to Sovieis in the Uniid Siaies in that periou.

NOSENKO has been criticized because he did not know all the

details corcerning the Military Attaches which i: was considered he

should have known il be kad the specific responsibility for work against

the Military Aitaches during the indicated period of time. it is submitted

The effectiveness or non-effectiveness of NOSENKO during his

assignment to the First Section, First Department, from mid-March

1953 to late May 1955 can have little pertinency in the question of the

bona fides of NOSENKO if it is accepted that he actuaily was an oificer

in the First Section during this period of time. It is felt that iniormation

furnished by NOSENKO in current interviews and in previous interviews

is of sufficient scope and detail that his claimed service as an

in the First Section during this period of time is completely acceptable.

D. During the périod of 1955 - 1900, NOSENKO was neither a

seidor case officer in, nor Deputy Cher o1, the Seventh Department,

American-British Commonwcaith Section. (Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "D" in the previous summary. The

current conclusion is that NOSENXO was an officer in the Seventh

Department, SCD, from late May i955 to December 1959 and was

Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section, Seventi

Department from 1958 to December 1959.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has furnished extensive

information concerning his own activities in the Seventh Department

during the 1955-1959 period. Interviews of persons who were the subject

of KGB interest collateraily confirm that NOSENKO was personally in-

volved in certain claimed activities during 1955 to December 1959.

These activities include among others the recruitment of Richard BURGI

in June 1956, contact with Sir Allen LANE and Arthur BIRSE in the

summer of 1957, the recruitment of Gisella HARRIS in 1958, the re-

cruitment of George DREW in the spring of 1959, the recruitment of

William Stanley WiLBY in June 1959, the recruitment of David TAYLOR

in the summer of 1959, the recruitment oi Gerard VERTENS in July -

August 1959, and the recruitment of Arsere FRIPPEL in 1959. The

foregoing is not a complete list of all cases in which NOSENKO ciaims

personal invoivement, but is representalive oi cases in wnich his allegea

participation has been confirmed by interviews with the individual who

was the KGB target.

Sir Allen LANE, Arthur BIRSE, William Stanley WILBY, and

David TAYLOR were British citizens and the other above-named indi-

viduals were United States citizens. This would seem to substantiate

the claim of NOSENKO that during 1955 - December 1959 he was an

officer engaged in KGB operations against American-British Common-

wealth tourists in the USSR.

in addition, NOSENKO has furnished specific information about

an operation against Viartin MALIA, an American tourist who was in

the Soviet Union from approximately September 1955 to December 1955.

ViALIA has not been interviewed and will not be interviewed, so at this

time no particular 1955 case in which NOSENKO claims invoivement

or personal knowledge has been substantiated by interview of the

individual involved.

NOSENKO has furnished inormation on the travel of certain

United States Government officiais, inciuding Congregsional represent-

atives to the ÜSSR in 1955 - 195ó; and the trip oi Supreme Court Justice

William O. DOUGLAS in 1955 which, when consisred with the previously

mentioned specifies, adequately substantiate his nimed service in the

Seventh Department and work against American-British Commorwealth

tourists during the late May 1955 - December 1959 period.

NOSENKO has stressed that when he transferred to the Seventh

Department, the Tourist Section had just been established and an agent

network was not vailable for opcrations against American and British

tourists. This seems quite logical since the infiux of tourists into the

USSR was ju t in a iormalive stage.

NOSENKO has spoken in detail about an agent network he dc-

veloped after 1955 which primarily consisted of Intourist personnel

and two homosexual agents, "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" (KGB code

names), whose extensive use in KGB operations has been confirmed by

interviews with individuais who were the subject of homosexual com-

promise operations.

was not an oificer in the claimed positions in the Seventh Department

during the period of late Vay 1955 - December 1959. Nor is it con-

areas of information were accepied without quaiification, there is any

evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. However, inere

are certain assumptions and interprctations which appeared in the

previous summary which are particularly worthy of comment and waich

are considered erroneous or require additional clarification.

On page 145 it is stated that the evidence suggests that NOSENKO

was an English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a couater-

intelligence officer responsible for the identification of foreign ageris

among tourists or for the development, recruitment, and exploitation

of agents for the KGB. The Second Chief Directorate, KGB, and the

MVD have used homosexual and heterosexual compromise in numerous

known (and presumably iriknown) successíul recruitments and recruit-

ment attempts.

This activity has noi been limited to the Seventh Depart-

ment, SCD; and the innuendo that NOSENKO was "only an English-

speaking specialist in sexual entrapment" and not a KGB gaUdritien

considered with the detaied itormation NOSENKO has provided on

Sevenin Departineni persoirel, activities, procedures, and topica of

a similar tature is not considered to have any ioundation in fact.

Page 145 oi the above surnmary lists eleven operations which

were Seventh Depariment Cases prior to 1960 and which were included

in the notes furnished to ClA in 1964 by NOSENKO. The named operations

were those against Berrard PECHTER, Patrick PRESSMAN, Join RUFE.

Gerald SEVERN, Sofia SHATTAUER, (inu) KARLOV, Norman FISK,

Ralph MATLAW, Varvin KAVIOR, Michael GINSBURG, and William

TARASKA. The criticism made in regard to the above eleven cases

was that NOSENKO could not describe the irdividual operations other

than to say that he had recorded the name of the larget and such details

as he could acquire when he reviewed the activities of the Seventh Depart-

• ment in 1962 foilowing his return from the Firet Department.

The notes brought out by NOSENiO aïe considered in another

section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a fuil review

of all of the notes oi NOSENKO currently availabie indicates that his

statements as to how and why he obtained the information in the notes

are completely piausible.

A detailed explanation of the notes furnished

by NOSENKO would almost necessitate a separate listing of ine approxi-

mately 150 cases or names mentioned in the notes.

During curreni interviews, NOSENKO furnished specific

indormation on certain of the above eleven cases, including William

TARASKA, Bernará PECTiTER, Michaei GINSBURG and John RUFE.

I shouid aiso be noied that certain of the cases such as Marvin KANTOR

ard William TARASKA were cases in wich the tourist was visiting

reiatives in the Soviet Union and that NOSENKO has giver a satisiactory

expianation oi how he jearned oi the KANTOR case. NOSENKO has, in

discussing his duties as Depuy Chief oi the American-British Common-

wealth Section, aiso explained that il a tourist indicated that he intended

to visit relatives in the USS?., the case automatically was assigned to a

group di officers in the Section who reported directiy to the Chief of

Section and were not under the supervision of NOSENKO.

NOSENKO has stated that he noted the names of three oi the

individuals when retiring the files of "GRIGORIY" and "SHMELEV, "

two homosexual agents of NOSENKO previously mentioned. NOSENKO

has expiained that "SHIMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" had the assignment of

identifying American travelers with homosexual tendencies, that they

had contact with numerous Amcricans, and that they had homosexual

activity with individuals on whom they reported but on whom no overt

action was taken by the Seventh Department. In some cases the individual

was not considered a worihwhile target and in others the iniormation

was just maintained for possible use at a later date if the individual

returned to the USSR.

NOSENKO has aiso explained how he learned of the Patrick

PRESSMAN and Gerald SEVER, cases; and, the listing oi the Sofia

SHATTAUER case in connection with the 1955 - 1959 period is in com-

plete error since page 427 of the previous summary contains information

from NOSENKO on her recruitment in 1962. During current interviews

the notes which NOSENKO brought out in 1964 have been discussed in

detail with NOSENKO. He has given a detailed explanation of the material

which he brought out and his explanation of all aspects is very convincing.

The previous summary (page 144) suggested that the involvement

•i NOSENKO in cerlain cases being handled by other Sections in the

Seventh Department or by ihe KGB Directorate oi Muscow was, unusual.

An examination of the cited cases does not indicate that his participation

was unusual, but rather that his explanation of why he was involved is

logical and normal. No consideration was previously given to the English

language capability of NOSENKO or the fact that his own homosexual agents

were used in two of the four cited cases.

The summary also noted that there was a question concerning

whether Gisella HARRIS was necessarily a Seventh Department case.

SEÜNE!

This question seems quite superfluous since HAzit was in the USSR

on a tourist visa and "scal" tourists are the responsibility of the Seventi

Depariment. Departinental rcoponsibility within the SCD for an indi

vicual traveling in the USSR is decided or the basis of how the indivicual

is traveling: i. e., whetner on à tourisi visa, as a member of a deiogation.

as the invitee of an organization in the CSSR, as a former diplomat

stationed in Voscow, as a dipiomat not previously stationed in Moscow,

as a member of ine Cuitural Exchange program, as a student attending

a university in the USSR, etc. There are also various other factors

which affect the determination of which Department or organizational

component of the SCD has the responsibility for a tourist case. These

factors include whether the individual is already suspected of foreign

intelligence connections and whether the individual is a businessman.

In addition, certain actual tourists in the USSR may never become the

responsibility oi the SCD if tre individual is of specific interest to the

FCD.

On pages 148 - 149, NOSENKO is criticized for not knowing at

least some of the substance of the information furnished by George

BLAKE in regard to the CIA-MI-6 program of utilizing tourist agents

in the USSR. This criticism compleiely ignored the fact that NOSENKO

made several references in 1962 to the KGB having such information

althouga he did then and still suspects thai William VASSALL was the

source. The relerences by NOSENKO to the KGB having such inior-

mation were not developed in 1902 or later interrogationg, and it was

not until current interviews thai it was established that NOSENZO had.

According to NOSENXO, the iniormation which was covious iy only

The previous summary (page 149) also notes that in 1961 CLA

acquired a lengthy Top Secret study on the subject of the use of tourists

by American Intelligence for espionage and operational support in the

Soviet Urion (document was lurnished by GOLITSYN following his de-

fection in Decemder 1901). it was noied that ine summary contained

"references to certain 1958 - 1959 tourists whom the KGB counter-

intelligence identified as Amirican agents and noted that NOSENKO

claimed he was Deputy Chief oi the American-British Commonwealth

Section in this period of time and that he claimed the KGB identified

no American Intelligence agenis during this period of time. What later

is described as a claim by NOSENKO is reither an accurate reflection

of what NOSENKO said prior to 1967 or has said since 1967.

of tnese travelers wolic lave been the reaponsibility of a section in

ine Sevenin Departrer, other than the American-British Commer-

weaith Section, or aroiner. Depariment in the SCD. NOSENKO was

quite aware that certain of the American touriste in 1958 - 1959 were

actig suspiciously from a KGB point of view.

NOSENKO has stated he was aware that a document which the

Seventh Department had prepared and iurnished to the FCD in an effort

to obtain further assistance from the FCD in the work against tourists

had been compromised by GOLITSYN. NOSENIO stated he was not in

the Seventh Department when the document was preparca and did not

review the documeni until after the defection of GOLITSYN and foiow -

ing advice from the FCD to the Seventh Department, SCD, that the

document rad been compromised. The document furnished by GOLITSYN

has never been reviewed with NOSENKO to determine if it contained

additional information not in the document which he was aware had

been prepared by the Seventh Department ior the FCD.

NOSENKO bas been impugned on his apparent unfamiliarity with

a number of cases cited as examples in the document furnished by

F. NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the

American-British Commonwealth Section and was thereafter a

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not crediole. (Previous

conclusion)

The conclusion of this summary is that NOSENKO was Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section (First Section) from

January 1962 to July 1962 and that he was a Deputy Chief of the Seventh

Department tbereafter.

NOSENKO has stated that, although he was offered the position

of a Deputy Chiei of the First Department, SCD, by Oleg M. CRIBANOV,

Chief, SCD, and although an order had been prepared and was in the

Personnel Directorate, be declined the profered position.

According to NOSENKO, he knew that Sergey Mikhaglovich

FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the First Department, did not want NOSENKO

as a Deputy Chief, but instead wanted to promoie Vladislav KOVSHUK,

then Chief of the First Section, to the position. FEDOSEYEV was

willing to promote, NOSENKO to the position of Chief, First Section.

However, GRIBANOV did not wish to promote KOVSHUK and NOSENKO

considered inat under the circumstances it would be better for him to

return to the Seventh Department rather than to become a Deputy to

FEDOSEY EV who wanted KOVSriüKas a Deputy,

Vladimir Dmitriyevich CHELNOKOV had offered NOS ENKO the

position of Chief of the First Section, Seventh Department, pending the

reassignment of BALDIN to Germany at which time NOSENKO would

become a Deputy Chief, Seventh Department, replacing BALDIN. The

above explanation of NOSENKO seems plausible and credible and indi

cates that GRIBANOV, the Chief of the SCD, for reasons best known to

GRIBANOV, was assisting NOSENKO in his career in the KGB.

This section actually covers two periods in the claimed career

§ NOSENKO; namely, January - July 1962 as Chief of the First Section,

and July 1962 - January 1964 as a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Depart-

ment. Since NOSENKO was in Geneva, Switzerland, from March to

June 1962, he actually cannot be seriously faulted for not having de-

tailed knowledge of the activities of the First Section during January -

July 1962. The previous summary (pages 268 - 291) contains remarke

in regard to the January - July 1962 period, including the period oi

March - June 1962 when he was in Geneva. Four specific tourist cases

0001219

## Page 222

13-00000

are discussed in the previous summary: the cases of Wallace Everett

JOHNSON, William Carroll JONES, Natalie BIENSTOCK, and Horst

BRAUNS. Apparent conlicts between information from NOSENKO and

information derived from subsequent interviews with these individuals

were cited as evidence impugning NOSENKO. It is not believed that the

previous comments concerning these cases constitute any substantial

evidence that NOSENKO did not hoid the claimed position of Chief oi the

First Section, Seventh Department, during January - July 1962. That

there were KGB operations against JOHNSON, JONES, BIENSTOCK and

BRAUNS has been confirmed through interviews by the FBI of all iour

individuals.

A few additional remarks in regard to the above four cases are

warranted, not because it is considered that there are any substantial

discrepancies between wizat NOSENKO has said and what each individual

stated when interviewed, but because they may provide additional clari-

fication.

In the Wallace Everett JOHNSON case, it was previously noted

that JOHNSON arrived in Moscow on 31 December 1961 and that the KGB

operation against him occurred on 5 January 1962. The summary sug-

gested that the short lapse of time indicated that the homosexual tend

encies of JOHNSON were known to the KGB prior to his arrival, contrary

to the statements of NOSENKO. NOSENKO during current zagview

3

## Page 223

13-00000

has stated that the KGB learea of the homoscrual tendencies oi JOHNSON

"by chance" soon after his arrivai. "STiVELEY" and "GRIGORIY, "two

homosexual agenis of NOSENKO, were at the time operating out oi a room

at the Metropol Hotei where jOHNSON stayed. They met ICHSON there

and reported his apparent homosexual tendencies.

In regari to the William Carrol JONES case, NOSENKO during

current interviews has furnished additional information on the KGB operation

against JONES, including the woman iudmila BUGAY EVA who was recruiied

as an agent to work against JONES and was used in another case. The other

details furnished by NOSENXO concerning the JONES case are compatibie

with his claim to having been Chief of the First Section, Severth Department.

In regard to the Nataie BIENSTOCK case, NOSENKO did ros claim

to have been the responsible case officer but was abie to provide erough

specific informaiion concerning tre case to bring about a coriession when

she was interviewed by the FBI. That he did not know all the cetails con-

cerning the BIENSTOCK case could be explained by his claim to have been

Chief of Section and not the case oificer directly invoived with the case.

In regard to the Forst BRAUNS case, in the previous summary

the criticism was levied that NOSENKO did not know why BRAUN'S visited

the USSR and was not able to identify any Soviet citizens whom BRAUNS

met in the USSR. It was also stated that NOSENKO had explained that

0001221

## Page 224

the Seventh Depariment was no, concerned wit foreigners visiting

reiatives in the ESSR nor with Soviet expatriates. NOSENKO, accord-

ing to the previoss summary, was aware that BRAUNS was a former

Soviet citizen and ibe summary siated loat his pian to visit relatives

was information available to the KGB trough his visa application.

In regará to the staiemen: that toe Sevenih Depäriment was not

concerned with foreigners visiting relatives in tae USSR nor with Soviet

expatriates, this is not in agreement with curren: information from

NOSENKO, * Cases of "true" tourists, which were normally the respon

another department or KGB component where Soviet relatives were

involved. Howerer, if the case was not taker over or assigned by higher

authority to anoicer department or component, it was and remained the

responsibility of the Seventh Department. The fact that BRAUNS was a

former Soviet citizen could very well have made BRAUNS of interest to

the Second Section, First Deparimeni, or a direction in tae Service of

the SCD. However, in the aosence of an actual reassignment by higher

authority, the case would remain the responsibility of the Sevents Depart

ment since BRAINS was visiting the Soviet Union on a tourist visa. The

previous summary also indicaied that BRAUNS listed on his visa appli-

cation that he planned to visit relatives in Leningrad. BRAUNS bad a

relative or relatives in Leningrad. Although BRAUNS, when interviewed by

the FBI, mertioned a number of items oi which the KGB was aware concern-

ing his background and occupation irom his visa application, there is no

specific reierence in these interviews indicating his statement of purpose

in visiting ine SSR.

Pages 282 - 28ó of the previous summary revicws remarks by

NOSENKO on the Boris BELITSKIY case and states that his claimed role

in the case was not plausible. There are several accific points made in

the summary which imply that NOSENKO was lying about his knowledge of

the case. Taere is adequate reason to believe thai NOSENKO exaggerated

his own 1962 role in that NOSENKO now states he was to give assistance

¿o Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV in the handling of BELITSKIY in Geneva

in 1962 and rot to supervise ARTEMOV.

The more important aspect and the primary one is the difference in

"what NOSENIO specifically reported about the BELITSKIY case and inior-

mation from the actual CiA record of the case. There are major dilier-

ences and without going into all the details of the case which is very involved,

an effort has been made toward determining whether these apparent differ-

ences necessarily indicate that NOSENKO was or is lying or whether there

is a possibility he is relating the actual KGB version of the case.

NOSINKO has stated that BELITSKIY was a KGB agent whom

American Inielligence recruited in London in 1960 or 1961 and that the

0001223

6

-SECRET

---

## Page 226

13-00000

KGB purpose in running the operation was to lure American Intelligence

into meeting BELITSKIY inside he USSR. The previous summary stated

that NOSENKO did no: know when the BELITSki: oporation started

(Brussels, Belgium, 1958), did not know the nature of the British

involvement, did n:t know the operational details and contact arrange-

ments BELITSKIY had with CIA, ard did not know BELITSKIY's paitern

of activity in Moscow or Geneva.

NOSENKO during current interviews has indicated an awareness

that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use

BELITSKIY against the British. However, he still has dated the recruit-

ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in Loadon and still states that the

primary purpose of the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in

contacts with BELITSKIY within ine USSR. The latter was considered

• completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSKIY was recruited in

Brussels, Belgium, in 1958; that three letters bad been mailed to

BELITSKIY in the USSR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY

had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR.

There are at this time sufficient unresolved questions in the

BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis

crepancies between the statements by NOSENKO on the BELITSKIY

case and the actual record are a reflection against NOSENKO U0l1 224

SECRET

## Page 227

toe other band, there is some reason to believe NOSENKO bas

furnished the actual KGB version of the BELITSKIY case and that the

KGB, at least as of 1962, did not know the true story of the relation-

ship of BELITSKIY with CIA. There is a distinct possibility the

KGB believed the SEMITSKIY recruitment occurred in 1961 in London

and BELITSKIY did not then nor has be since admitted to the KGB

his association with CIA actually started in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium.

As a possible reason way BELITSKIY would have told the KGB in

1961 a partial story of his contact with American Intelligence, some

at present unknown event may have occurred in 1961 which caused

BELITSKIY to believe his security was endangered and as a result

he told the KGB of certain events in Loadon in 1961, relating these

events as being the original approach to BELITSKIY by CIA.

The following are certain of the points which suggest the KGB

actually considered that BELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in London

in 1961 and that BELIISKIY may have never told the KGB of the

developments in his case prior to 1961;

(a) BELITSKIY was in London in April 1960 at which

time he was in contact with a British citizen who was also

reporting to MI-5. This individual reported information

received from BELITSKIY which may have been a lead to

0001225

8

SECRET

## Page 228

13-00000

George BLAKE. (It scems highly undikely the KGB would

ever have directed BELITSKIY to iurnish information which

may have been a lead to George BLiKE, or at least could

have caused the employees of the knit in which BLAKE was

employed from June 1959 io August 1900 to come under

suspicion as having passed information to Soviet Intelligence.)

(b) NOSENKO has staied that BELTSKIY, aiter he went

to Geneva in 1962, managed to reinitiate contact with CIA

rather quicily because he met a girl he had previously known

whom he was sure was an American Intelligence agent and

that she must have reported his presence in Geneva to American

Intelligence. (l the BELITSiSIY case had been controlled by the

KGB from its inception in 1958, the KGB would have known of

the internal mailings to BELITSKIY and the fact that BELITSKIY

had a cover address outside the Soviet Union through which to

initiate contact. However, if BELITSKIY did not tell the KGB

anything about his contacts with CIA prior to 1961 and then

gave only a partial story of what happened in London in 1961,

BELITSKIY would not have told the XGB of the internal mail-

ings to BELITSKIY in the USSR or the fact that he long had

a cover address outside the USSR. BELITSKIY therefore

As previously indicated, the conclusion is there are a sufficient

number of unresoived questions in the BELITSKIY case so that discres

ancies between information i:om NOSENKO and the actual record in the

BELITSKIY Case cannot at present be considered as a reilection against

YOSENKO, and there is a distinct possibility the KGB actually did not

know the true facts of the BELITSKlY case.

The previous summary nored on page 106 that Nataliya SHULGINA

was an Intourist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO in 1955. It also

noted that NOSENKO had stated Boris BELITSKIY "reported to the KGB

that CIA had warned BELITSKIY agairst SHULGINA. " The previous

• stated BELITSKIY reported to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB

agent and "CIA did not warn BELITSKIY. "

There appears to be no doubt at this time that the statement by

DOSENKO that BELITSKIY reported the "CIA had warned BELITSKIY

against SHULGINA, " is a rcasonably accurate description of what actualy

happened in May 1962 during Agency contacts with BELITSKIY in Geneva.

The record reflects that BELITSKIY stated SHULGINA had confidentially

told him of her status as a KGB agent, stating she had been doubled by

the KGB after having been forcibly recruited by American Intelligence

while previously in Paris, France.

G001228

## Page 231

13-00000

it was determined there was no collateral imormation which

would indicate that the statement by SHULGINA had any factual basis

and BELITSKIY was warned SHULGINA may have been acting on behaid

of the KGB in stating to BELITSKIY she had been "iorcibly recruited by

American Inteiligence" at a previous date. It was also suggested to

BELITSKIY that he should go to the KGB as a loyal Soviet citizen and

report the apparent indiscretion of SHULGiNA.

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary, in connection with

the BELITSKIY case, made reference to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV.

It was stated that ARTEVOV had been involved with a series of America.

tourist agents in the Soviet Union and although NOSENKO was allegedly

familiar with ARTEMOV, he was unaware of the involvement of ARTEMOV

with American tourist agents in 1958 - 1959. The summary noted this

-was during a period when NOSENKO claimed to have been Deputy Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section of the Seventh Depart-

ment. Although not specificaily stated, the above suggested ARTEMOV

was actually in the Seventh Department in 1958 - 1959 and that NOSENKO

was not even aware ARTEMOV was in the Seventh Department. NOSENKO

has consistently stated that ARTEMOV was assigned to the First Section,

First Department, from the time he entered into the KGB in approxi-

mately 1957.

12

SECRET

0001229

## Page 232

13-00000

A closer examination of the cases described in the previous

summary. as "CiA American tourist agents," reveals there is no con-

flict in the invoivement of ARTEMOV in these cases and ine statement

by NOSENKO that ARTEMOV was with the First Section, First Depart-

ment.

As an example, one of the cases is the case of Edward McGOWAN.

NOSENXO has furnishica irformation concerning this case, stating it was

originally a Seventh Department case and that after the mailing of a leiter

by the individual in Minsk, the case was immediately taken over by the

First Department. There is adequate reason to believe ARTEMOV only

became involved after the case was transferred to the First Department.

Another of the cases involved the contact of ARTEMOV with L

no circumstances be considered a true tourist or the responsibility of

the Seventh Depariment, particulariy since apparently the individual was

Directorate required or desired support from ine SCD, it would normally

request the First Department for such assistance and it is extremely ur-

likely that the FCD would request ine Seventh Department ior assistance

in a case involving an American diplomat.

Pages 332 - 333 of the previous summary contain the basis

¡or the previous conclusion thai the claim of NOSENIO that he was a

Deputy Chiei di the Seventh Departinent from July 1962 to January

1963 was not crcdible. It is considered that a detailed rebuttal is

not necessity since this conclusion was apparently based on inadegudie

information. During current interviews, NOSENKO bas furnished

details concerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position

which substantiate his claim, to having been a Deputy Chief of the

Sevents Depariment from July 1962 to January 1964.

1n example in support of the staiement that the previous conclu

sion was based on inadequate information is the matter of the written

rotes which NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 1964.

The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is

inadeguate, inaccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews,

an effort had not been made to obiain from NOSENKO a detailed expiar-

ation of his notes or of boiv he obtained the information in the notes.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed iniorma-

tion concerning all aspects of his notes. This information supports ais

claimed position of Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and includes

collateral support to bis claim of being Deputy Chief of the First Section,

First Department, in 1960 - 1961.

Primarily the notes di NOSENKO can be calegorized as

follows:

• (a) Snori case sunmaries by the Chicfs of the

First Seciion, Second Section and Sixth Section, Seventa

Depärtment. NOSENKO has siaied that he was in 1962 -

1963 responsibie for supervision over these Sections and

that Filip Denisovich BOBKOV, Depudy Chiei, SCD, who

supervised the Seventh Depariment, requested a list of all

recruited agents of the Seventh Department. According to

NOSENKO, the order irom BOBIOV was to only retain the

files (cases) of agents in tourisi firms and that the files of

other recruited agerts should be sent to the FCD or Archives.

NOSEN%O has stated that ne in turn levied on the Chieis of

the inree Sections the reguirement of BOBKOV, but also ex-

panded the request to include ail 1960 - 1962 cases, no:

excluding previous cases or cases which had already been

given to the FCD. The notes of NOSENKO included hand-

written reports from the Ciniei or Acting Chief of each Section

on recruited agents, with information varying from agent to

agent and even including some human errors.

Many of the above cases had previously been trans-

ferred to the FCD, but the remarks of NOSENKO aboli thejf0U1232

15

## Page 235

13-00000

inclusion support his statement that he had expanded

the original request irom BOBKOV so that he would have

some "pieces of information lo give ClA."

(b) Notes by NOSENKO on other cases waich he learned

of during the 1962 - 1963 period. Certain of the notes were

made from a review of a notebook kept by the Chief, Severin

Department, to which NOSENKO had access on at least two

occasions. Most of his notes were not detailed but were

sufficient to refresh the memory of NOSENKO at a later

date and yet were somewhat innocuous to maintain before

his defection.

(c) Notes for lectures to oificers of the Seventh Directorate

prepared while with the First Department, 1960 - 1961, and

the Seventh Department, 1962 - 1763.

(d) Drait report ior the briefing of the new Chief, First

Department, in the latter part of 1961.

(e) One of three copies of an unregistered report pre-

pared by the Chief, Seventh Department, and two Deputy Chiefs,

including NOSENKO. This was a briefing paper for use by the

Chief (CHELNOKOV) in an appearance beiore the Collegium

of the KGB which was reviewing the activitieu of the Seventh

Drpartment. According to NOSENKO, the prepared

report was never syped as.

a formal document.

The view has beea set forth thai NOSENKO took undue risk in

carrying written notes with him out vi the Soviet Union. An examination

of this material suggesis inat NOSENKO was using extreme care in

collecting material and was not attempting to obtain documents, the

possession of which might be incriminating or which if he had brought

out would have been immediately missed. Instead, he collected a con-

siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with

little or no fear that a search of his effects in the KGB aiter his depart-

ure for Geneva would disclose that certain material was missing. None

of the material was registered and all could have previously been des

troyed by NOSENKO.

The previous summary stated that NOSENKO brought three KGB

documents to Geneva. These were typed papers but none was registered

or actually accountable. The reference to three documents was to:

(a) The draft report for the briefing of the Coliegium

which has been mentioned previously.

(b) A typed two-page report on several cases. Actually

a Chief of Section had typed his notes on

cases instead of

submitting in handwriting as the others did.

G. NOSENiO: 25 no valici claim to certainty that the KGB

recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and his

defection in 196%. (Previous conclusion)

The concision in this summary is that NOSENKO is oi the

orizion that there were no iG3 recruitmenis o linited States Embassy

personnel in Moscow beiween 1953 and December 1963 with the excoption

Of "ANDREY" (Dayle Wailis SMITH) and Herbert'FiOWARD, who actually

was a 29 employee bus did work part of the time in the Embassy.

The question here is whether or not the expressed opinion of

NOSENKO is sufficiently based on actual krowledge so that this opinion

can be accepied as absolute evilence that there were no other KGB

recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time. The

only logical conclusion is that tac opinion of NOSENKO cannot be

accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, there is a possibility that

a recruitment could have occurred and NOSENKO not be aware in any

way of the recruitment. This sould in no way be interpreted as a

suggestion that NOSENXO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased

observer without personal knowledge could and should be hesitant to

accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO in this particular area.

The actual basis for the stated opinion of NOSENKO bould be

examined and can be cited as follows.

Department, and he has made the categorical statement

thai there were no recruitments by the KGB of United

States Embassy personnel during this period of time.

He has also stated that if there had been any recruitments

during the 1953-1959 period he is sure he would, during

1960-1961, have heard or learned some details of 404)01239

case or cases. There is merit to this contention by

NOSENKO since the Chief oi Section was Vladislav

KOVSHUK wno had been an ofticer of the First Depart-

meni since 1953, actually working in the First Section

excepi ior the periods of time that he was in the United

States to reactivaie "ANDREY" in 1957-1958 and a

period of time that he was Deputy Chief of the First

Department.

(d) During 1962-1963 NOSENKO was again in the

Seventà Department. However, he continued to maintain

contact with certain officers of the First Section, First

Department: in particular, Gennadiy I. GRYAZNOV,

who succeeded NOSENKO as Deputy Chief of the First

Section, then became Chief of Section, and in the latter

part of 1963 became a Deputy Chief of the First Department.

According to NOSENKO his relationsbip with

GRYAZNOV was sufficiently close during 1962-1963 that

he is sure GRYAZNOV would have furnished NOSENKO

some iniormation in regard to any successful recruitments

of United States Embassy personnel. NOSENKO pointed

out that he learned of the existence of the Herbert HOWARD

case from GRYAZNOV in 1962, although it was not until

1963 that NOSENKO heard the name.

NOSENKO actually

learned of tbe namo when the Firat Sectlon, Firet

Departnent, needed the services of the Seventh

Department (Third Section) in obtaining a room i z

certain hosel for the Soviet girl friend of HOWARD.

In gonoral the above constitutes the basis for the stated opinion

Of NOSENKO that "ANDREY" and Herbert HOWARD were the only

Duccessful KGB recruftmente during 1953 - December 1963. It should

be noted chat there are no other Identified IGB recruitmente during

this pertod of time which would spectfically refute the opinlon of

NOSENKO. However, in vlew nê the cilod actual basto for the opinion

Of NOSENKO, acceptance of the opinion of NOSENKO as being an

honest opiaton should no: be couverted into & statement that it le

absolute proof that anosher recruitment could not have occurred.

NOSENIO may be completely correct in hie opinion, but dince

NOSENKO was only in the Firat Department 1953 - 1955 and 1960 - 1961

his opinion that he would have heard "something" about a recruitnent

In 1953 - 1959 or 1962 - 1963 ¿annot be accepted as infallible.
