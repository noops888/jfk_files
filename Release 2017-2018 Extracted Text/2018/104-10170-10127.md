Sergio Viconte ARCACHA Saith (Enclosure 2 of referenco memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba

1.

•Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the dato he first

arrived in thou.s. However,

he became the FRENTE REVOLU

CIONARIO DEBOCRATICO (FRD) delegate In New Orleans prior

to tho Bay of Pigs invision and continued in that position

until the FRD ceased to function.

The FRD was the predecessor

of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and

supported by the Agency.

The organization was used as a

front for rocrultment of Brigado 2506 for the invasion.

During this poriod ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters

in Niami through a post office box in Coral Gables, and

reportodly maintained extensivo relations with the New

Orleans FBI and Immigration offices.

Two of his regular

FBI contacts woro & Mr. De Bruce and the deceased Guy

2:

ARCACIA was also one of the promoters of the

FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which was licorpornted

In New Orleans on 6 January 1961.

This organization was

ostensibly created by several New Orleans business and

political figures, including the decensed former FBI agont,

Guy Banister;

to collect coney to ald Cubans in their

right against Communism.

According to the articles of

incorporation;

these donations would also be used to support

the FRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,

less a percentage to be retained by. the FDC.

An investi

gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded

that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal sain

of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of

ARCACHA.

The investigation produced no evidence that any

individual donations. were ever solicited or reccived and

recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the

books of the New Orleans Exporters Company be investigated

for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of

federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New

Orleans Exporters Company, Gerard F.

Tunague, and the Chief

of New Orleans Stevedores

Union, Alfred Chittenden, were

officials of the FDC.

Approximately one month after the

FDC was created,

strong criticism from some

prominent Cubans

put the organization: out of business.

Information in an inmigration card reflects that

ARCACHA travelled to Caracas,

Venezuela at an unspecified

His address in. Venezuela was HOTEL TIUNA, Caracas,

and his Us address. was listed as 4523 Duplesses Street,

New Orleans.: Passport No. 00133.

Emillo SANTANA (paragraph y C of reference memorandum)

ĐPOB:

7 Sept I935, Cardenas' 1936 and

Cuba

(also reported 7 Sept

Intanzasy Sept 1937

Subject is probably identifiable with Emilio SANTANA

Galindo, who was recruited by JNWAVE in December 1960 as a

guide for an infiltration team.

SANTANA was pald a monthly

salary under provisions of his NOC until he was terminated

on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team

became inoperable due to occupation of the target area by

Soviet technicians:

Another compelling reason for SANTANA's

termination stemmed from his untruthful reporting concerning

certain aspects of the team operations.

In an attempt to establish positive identification,

JAWAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (Miant)

Sheriff's office that an Emilio SANTANA (no matronymic)

•born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a fugitive from

Louisiana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet

132287F, based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana.

He was

arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff'g

office on 2 February 1966 and was presumably sent back to

Louisiana.

At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his

address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same

address

shown on an old immigration' brm when he was

living in Miami.

Headquarters files indicate SANTANA 1s

separated from his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami address.

Since SANTANA's date of birth: vartes

on various documents in his 201 file, the variation in birth

date on his arrest sheet is not conclusive:

The fact he

did give his former address to the arresting officers

indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo. A 1962 immigration

form includes a photograph which could

be obtained from

JMNAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

Although JUWAVE has had

no contact with SANTANA

his termination, there is a note in Station files

23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his:

employer on an auto credit application.

DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIASTIL (DRE)

1.

Tho Dre was concolved, created and funded by the

Agency In September 19G0 and terminated in December 1966.

It was an outgrowth of the activtst student group in Cuba

which fousht akainst BATISTA and later against CASTRO.N

Many of the leadors came into exile around September 1960

and vere subsequently tralned and Infiltrated into Cuba

by the Arency In late 1960 whore they operated by obtain-

tox Intelligonco sotting up action teams,

ete., up through

the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

While the DRE was initially set

up as a psych warfare outfit, the orcantzation was given a

large amount of paramilitory ald in funds and material.

After the Shy of Pies, the DRE engaged in independent

mIlitary actions, which declined at Agency direction and

because of a roduction in funds

from lato 1962 untll tor

mination of the group.

Members were used through 1966 ag

political action agents, for publishing propaganda which

was sent throughout

the Hemisphere,

attending

internattonal

student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio

programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2.

After the cutback in military operations any

of the

best DRE members

relocated in other

areas.

present there are delegations in most Latin American coun

tries which have maintalned some contact with various

Agency stations over the years although the DRE is no

longer very active.

During the organization's 6 jear

period of actlve existence DRE personnel were in contact

with several wAVE staffers and outside contract agents.

However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contact

with DRE personnol was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel

SALVAT, the curront DRE Secretary General whoris now

operating a bookstore in Miant, Florida,

THE INFOEYATION COUNCIL OF THE ANERICAS, INC. (INCA)

ISCA is an anti-Communist propaganda organization

with headquarters In New Orleang,

that disseminates English

and forelen language propaganda tapes and films on a world

wide basts. conducts public foruns of an extremist

political nature,

etc.

The organizational impetus and funds

apparently come from wealthy Sow Orleans figures including

Dr. Alton OCHSNER, of the OCHSSER CLINIC, and Willard E.-

ROBERTSON.

In recent yoars funds have been supplied of the

SCILICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY. An ISCA letterhead listing all

the officers and offictals has been requested from JAvE,

which fias had some casual correspondence with the organiza-

tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO.

visit where Miss CASTRO was given

an award at a dinner

sponsored by INCA.

The dinner, which was attended by civic

Icaders and representatives of

all news media, took place

shortly

after Miss CASTRO's defection and there was

considerable interest in her appearance.. INCA was particularly

interested since

it had distributed hundreds of English

and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when

she

was. surfaced

in Mexico.

In October 1966 INCA again

requested that Miss CASTRO

appear as a guest speaker in

major American citles in connection with the release of

the INCA motion picture production "HITLER IN HAVANA".

Following various reviews of the file, JIWAVE decided the

film would probably become controversial and it would

be

inadvisable to permit Miss

CASTRO to accept the invitation.

Because of INCA's

extremist political orientation, JuwAVE

has wanted to

avold any move involvesent between

and INCA and Based to prevent this

one casual contact betweenbour asset-and Edward BUTLER,

Executive Vice-President of INCA, since Miss CASTRO'S 1965

FRENTE REVOLLCIONARIO DENOCRATICO (FRD)

. (CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FROVT)

1. Tho FRD was created with Agency

assistance,

guidance and financial support in Hay

1960 and consisted

of soveral antl-CASTRO groups.

The FRD was forned aga

political action, propaganda and military unit.

Initial

actions consisted of extonsive radio and printed propaganda,

demonstrations, and trips

throughout the Hemispherc to gain

support for the fight against CASTRO.

The FRD also functioned

as the front orkanization for recruiting

the members of

the Bay of Pigs Invasion force and carried

out & missive

program of social assistance to Brigado 2506 members in

training camps and thelr fanilies.

Although the FRD head-

quarters wore based in Miamt, delegates were assigned to

other arcas which included New Orleans,.

Louisiana,

Tampa,

Florida,

and Moxico City, to gather intolligence and

coordinate Cuban refugee

activities

2 :

In late 1960 or carly 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL (CRC) was

formed to coordinato and direct FRD

activities and this group was headed by Agency and white

House sponsored Dr. Jose MIRO Cardona, assisted by Manuel

ARTIME and Dr. Antonio VARONA.

Both

the FRD and the CRC

continued to function until October 1961. when the FRD was

completely absorbed by the CRC In order to avoid the confusion

resulting from duplication of personnel, activitles and

funding.

The CRC also had direct access

to President

Kennedy

and top hite House aides.

Because of the magnitude

of the FRD and CRC operations and the Agency participation

in the activitles and funding of the groups, a laige number

of JMWAVE and Headquarters were directly involved with both

FRD and CRC personnel.
