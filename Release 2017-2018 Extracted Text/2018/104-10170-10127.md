Serglo Viconte ARCACHA Smith (Enclosure 2 of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba

1, “Traces en.ARCACHA do tot reflect the date ho first
arrived in’ tho-U.S.° Howeter, he becamo the ‘FRENTE REVOLU~
CLONAREO.DEMOCRATICO. (FRD) delegate in New. Orleans prior
to thy ‘Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position
until tho FRD ceased to function, The FRD was the predecessor
Of the CUBAN: REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and
supported’ by the Agency. The organization was uscd as a
front for recruitment of Brigade 2506 for the invasion,

During this period ARCACHA reported to the FRD headquarters
in Miami ‘through ‘a post office box in Coral Gables, and
reportedly ‘maintained extensive relations with tho New
Orleans FBI .and Immigration offices, Two of his regular
FBI contacts were a Mr, De Bruce and the deceased Guy

Banistor,

2, ARCACHA. was also one of the promoters of the
FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which was incorporated
in New Orleans. on 6 January 1961. This organization was
ostensibly created by several New Orleans: business and
political figures, including the deceased former FBI agent,
Guy Banister, to collect money to aid Cubans in their .
fight against Communism, According to the articles of
incorporation, these donations would also be used to support
the FRD and the. funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,
less a percentage to be retained by. the FDC, An investi-
gation conducted by a reYiable Miami Station asset concluded
that the FDC.was organized strictly for the personal gain
of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of
ARCACHA, The’ {nvestigation produced no evidence that any
individual donations. were ever solicited or received and
recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the
books of the.Néw.Orleans Exporters Company be investigated
for evidence of personal gain and Possible evidence of
federal. tax evasion, since both the president of the New
Orleans Exporters Company, Gerard F. Tunague, and the Chief.
of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were
officials of the FDC, Approximately one month after the
FDC was created, strong criticism from some prominent Cubans
put the organization: out of business,

3. Information in an immigration card reflects that
ARCACHA travelled to Caracas, Venezucla at an unspecified
date. His address in Venezuela was HOTEL TIUNA, Caracas,
and his US address was listed as 4523 Duplesses Street,
New Orleans.. Passport No, 00433.

Emilio SANTANA (paragraph 7 C of reference memorandum)

DPOB: 7 Sept 1935, Cardenas, Matanzas, Cuba.
(also reported 7 Sept'1936 and 7 Sept 1937

,l. Subject is probably identifiable with” Emilio: SANTANA
Galindo, who Was recruited by JMWAVE. in December 1960 as a
guide for an infiltration team, SANTANA was paid a monthly.
salary undér provisions of his MOC until he was terminated
on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team
became inoperable due to occupation of the target area’ by
“Soviet technicians. Another compelling reason for SANTANA'S
termination stemmed: from his untruthful reporting concerning
certain aspects of the team operations,

2, In an attempt to establish positive identification,
JNWAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (Miamt)
Sheriff's office that an Emilio SANTANA (no matronymic)
born 6 July 1936 in.Ciba, was declared a. fugitive from
Louisiana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet
132287F, based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana,

He was arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff's
office on 2 February’1966 and was presumably sent back to
Louisiana. At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his
address as. 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same
address shown on an old immigration. frm when he was
living. in Miami, Headquarters files indicate SANTANA is
separated from his wife who apparently still resides at :
the old Miami address, Since SANTANA's date of birth. varies.
- 0h various documents in his 202 file, the variation in birth: .
date on his arrest. sheet is not conclusive. The fact he —
did give his former address to the arresting officers
indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo. A. 1962 immigration
form includes a photograph which could be obtained. from
JMWAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

3. Although JMWAVE has had no contact with SANTANA
since his termination, there is a-note in Station files
dated 23 June 19€4 that SANTANA used the Agency as his
employer on an auto credit application,

with INCA prior to January 1965 when INCA sponsored Miss i
CASTRQ's appearance in New Orleans. At that time an Agency

leaders ‘and Tepresentatives of all news media, ‘took place
shortly after Miss CASTRO's defection and there was
considerable interest in her appearance. INCA wae particularly
interested since it had distributed hundreds of English
and Spanish language tapes containing her statements when
she was. surfaced in Mexico, In-October 1966 INCA again
requested that Miss CASTRO appear as a guest speaker in
major American cities in connection with the release of
the INCA motion picture Production "HITLER IN HAVAN, '.
Following various reviews of the film, JMWAVE decided the

FRENTE REVOLUCIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD)
(CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY | FRONT)

1, Tho FRD was created with Agency assistance,
guidance and financial support in May 1960 and consisted
of several anti-CASTRO groups. The FRD was formed as: a
political action, propaganda and military unit. Initial
actions consisted of extensive radio and printed propaganda,
demonstrations, and trips throughout the Hemisphere to gain
support for the fight against CASTRO, The FRD also functioned
as the front organization for recruiting the members of
the Bay of Pigs invasion force and carricd out a missive
program of social assistance to Brigado 2506 members in
training camps and their families. Although. the FRD head-
quarters wore based in Miami, delegates were assigned to
other ‘arcas which included New Orleans, Louisiana, Tampa,
Florida, and Mexico City, to gather intelligence and
coordinate Cuban refugee activities, :

2. In late 1960 or carly 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY
COUNCIL (CRC) was formed to coordinate and direct FRD
activities and this group was headed by Agency and White
House sponsored Dr. Jose MERO Cardona, assisted by Manuel
ARTIME and Dr, Antonio VARONA. Both the FRD and the CRC
continued to function until October 1961.when the FRD was
completely absorbed by the CRC in order to avoid the confusion
resulting from duplication of personnel, activities and
funding. The CRC also had direct access to President
Kennedy and top Bhite House fides, Because of the’ magnitude
of the FRD and CRC operations and the Agency participation
in the activities and funding of the groups, & large number
of JMWAVE and Headquarters were directly involved with both
FRD and CRC personnel,
