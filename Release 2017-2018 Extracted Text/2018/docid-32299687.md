investigative efforts of Italian Police in this matter.

Dr. MANOPULO has made himself available to Legat on a

24 hour basis and is frequently in telephonic contact

with police districts in Italy to make certain all leads

are covered.

Because of Dr. MANOPULO's excellent. coop-

eration, Legat. has been able to reply to Bureau requests

in a prompt manner. (alu)

At the present time Dr. MANOPULO has placed

stops for BRUNO at all airports and seaports in Italy.

All police districts have been alerted and re-alerted

by telegram and have been instructed to immediately

telephone Dr. MANOPULO should information regarding

BRUNO's whereabouts be obtained.

Particular investiga-

tive attention is being given by Italian Police in

Caltanisetta, Mosciano St. Angelo, and the small com-

munities surrounding Mosciano St.

Angelo. In this re-

Rome; Legat has also arranged for Italian Police at

s Fiumicino Airport to immediately cöntact him at

the office or home if BRUNO should prepare to travel to

the United States by air. (G-')(u)

On November 2, 1963, and again on November 5,

1963, contact was made with Mr. EVerell balioN, Consul,

American Embassy, Rome, relative to the restriction of

BRUNO's passport

for travel to the U.S. only. DAMRON

stated that he has not yet received word from the U.S.

Department of State concerning this matter. We are

following with DAMRON and will keep the Bureau advised

of developments.

Upon receipt of Bureau cable dated November 4,

1963, Dr. MANOPULO was requested to determine the loca-

tion of JAMES M. SALVATORE, reportedly, in Rome to give

$4,000.00 to BRUNO. As of the date of this letter, no

information has been received. (El)(a)

On November 5, 1963, Dr. MANOPULO called to

advise that Italian Police have determined there is no

motel or hotel in Mosciano St. Angelo.

The closest

motel to Mosciano St. Angelo is located at Pineto, Italy

(Pineto Motel), a small resort town on the Adriatic coast. (G-l/(u)
