SOURCE:

1. Contrary to the reports which are issued by the Cuban Government, the

financial status of the Cuban econony is rapidly deteriorating and
beconing a serious problem. During July 1959 an advisor to Prime
Minister Fidel CASTRO Rua, warned hin to proceed nore slowly with the
agrorian reform, because the Cuban treasury vaa running short of funds. Bees
It was pointed out that 57 sygar mills were barkrupt and had not paid

. the plantation owners for the 1959 sugar crop. CASTRO waa told that
4f the reckless confiscation of agricultural properties ccatinued, the
Cuban Goverment would become obligated to assume even more debts in
order to alleviate the hunger of farm vorkers.t :

2, Avother drain on the econony is goverment subsidies. For example,
the danoo de Desarrollo Econonico y Social (BANDES, Social and
Economie Development Bank) coutrols about U.S. $400 nillion in
properties and investnents such as the Compwita Cubans de Aviscion

Cuban Airline Company). The companies kave been caught in the
presont contraction of capital and cannot survive without goverment
subsidies, The subsidies paid by BAIDSS anount to U. S. $8 million
@ month, and this 1s only one exemple of the many payments vhich ere
draining tae Cuban treasury.2 .

2. Tre Source thought that nothing could stop CASTRO jn his determination

UC to proceed with the agrarian reform progran a9 fast as possible. Since
the biggest obstacle to carrying out this program 1s the lack of mossy,
the ‘touree was ef the opinion that CAST33 would do anything to obtain
this money aai night even confiscate bank accounts and moneys and nego-
tiable iretrmenta held in safety deposit daxes. Carrying thie one
step furthar, The yource thought such coufiscatory tactics could only.
be a teaporary saving dovice and that eventually it would be necessary
for CASTIO te obtain a large loan frax another country. Fe speculated
that this weald mean either the United States or the Soviet Union, and
feared that if it were the lattery/it vould ean the end of frienily
relations with tho United States. In respect to CASTRO's possible
hood for a loan, another, fairly reliable, source reported on 18 August
1959 that CASTR) was trying te obtain a 0,000,000-peso loan from xocet—
