I. Sontrary to the reporte which are issued by the Cuban Covermont, the

financial status of the Cuban economy le rapidly deteriorating and

beconing a serious problem. During July 1959 an advisor to Prime

Minister Fidel CASTRO fuz, warned hir to proceed more alowly with the

agrarian reform, because the Cuban treasury was running abort of funda.

It was pointed out that 57 aygar mille were barkrupt and had not paid

the plantation ownars for the 1959 sugar crop. CAST-O was told that

if the reckless confiscation of agricultural properties ecutinued, the

Cuban Governent would become obligated to asmme even more debts in

order to alleviate the hunger of farr vorkera 1

2. Another drain va the econory is goverment subsidies. For example,

the danoo de Desarrollo Econonico y Social (BANDES, Social and

Econonio Development Bank) coutrole about U. S. $400 a121103 In

properties and investments such as the Compañla Cubans de Aviacion

(Cuban Airline Company). The companies have been asurbt in the

present contraction of capital and cannot survive without goverrment

subaldies.

The subsidies paid by BArD'S amount to U. S. $8 million

a month, and this to only one exemple of the many payments which are

draining the Cuban treasury,?
