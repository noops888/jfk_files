1. The following CIA Staff Employees, all of whom

are now retired, participated in the preparation of DIR

86054 on 30 November 1963:

Originator: Mr. Louis Armstrong

Coordinators:

Mr. John M. Whitten, MT. William

Tyngs Ms- Sue L

Darling

Authenticator:

Mr. W11 liam B. Tyng" ("'for".

Desmond FitzGerald)

Releasor: Mr John Me Whitten ("for" J. C. King)

2. We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana

flight No. 465 on 22 November 1963 from Mexico City to Havana,

Cuba, was Mario MAURI who was accompanied by his wife, Maria

Antonieta MAURI. We have been unable to determine who trans-

mitted the information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we

have not been able to locate any documents relating to this

matter in Latin America Division files or the Oswald files.

We have been unable to locate any documents which

would indicate that there was a response to DIR 86054 from

Mexico City.

4.. Assuming there was no response to DIR 86054, the

originating Headquarters component should have initiated

follow-up action if a response was not received.

5.

We have

been

unable to find any further information

relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.
