2. We believe that the Italian diplomat on the Cubana
~ flight No. 465 on 22 November 1963 from Mexico City to Havana,
is} Cuba, was Mario MAURI who was accompanied by his wife, Maria
Antonieta MAURI. We have been unable to determine who trans-
mitted the information contained in DIR 86054 to CIA and we
have not been able to locate any documents relating to this
matter in Latin America Division files or the Oswald files.

3. We have been unable to locate any documents which
would indicate that there was a response to DIR 86054 from
Mexico City. . . :

4. Assuming there was no response to DIR 86054, the
originating Headquarters componeng” should have initiated
follow-up action if a response was not received.

5. We have been unable to find any further information
relating to DIR 86054 in Latin America Division files.
