MEMORANDUM FOR: MI. MeGeorge Bundy E

SUBJECT

:.

Intention of Cuban Exile Student Organization

(DRE) to Send Letter to President Kennedy

1. Confirming the advice given you on 8 December, it

has been reported to us by a reliable penetration source

within the organization that the Cuban exile student organi

zation, DRE (Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil), with

headquarters in Miami, has drafted a letter for President

Kennedy. The gist of this letter is that the DRE, while

recognizing the U. S. Government's problems and difficulties

with respect to the Cuban situation, still expects President

Rennedy to "fullfil his promises to

liberate Cuba."

2. The DRE leaders plan to give the letter to their

regular CIA contact officer on 12 December for transmittal

to the President. Subsequently, if steps are not taken by

the United States Government to carry out this pledge, the

DRE "will act.". The report does not state specifically what

action is contemplated by the DRE, but we assume that it

would involve a resumption of commando raids and harrassment

tactics against Cuba.

3. On 13 December the DRE plans to release this letter

to the press and on the same date will attempt to stimulate

maximum propaganda support in Latin America for the DRE position.

Preparatory to this attempt, the DRe will send special

emissaries to Costa Rica, Mexico, and other Latin American

countries. If the campaign results in substantial support

for the DRE position, the organization would prepare to

initlate "action against Cuba" subsequent to 17 December.

In addition to the foregoing, the DRE is considering broading

its base and developing into a political movement, provided

it can obtain appropriate support in Latin America.

4. We have instructed the source of this report, who

is a confidant of the DRE. leaders and, in fact, has been asked

to attempt

to dissuade the Dre from taking this precipitous action which

could harm the cause of Cuban liberation. We have not as yet

been advised of the results of our source's efforts in this

regard.

5. If the DRE leadership goes through with its plan to

present this letter to its CIA contact officer on 12 December,

the officer will make every effort to dissuade the DRe

leadership from thus attempting to pressure the United States.

Government.

6. We will keep you apprised of any important developments

in this matter.
