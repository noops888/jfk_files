P. 7.

On March 1, 1967, I contacted Mr. Delaha and reiayed the folloring

information to him:

We have Mir. Marochini's updated PIR. If anything comes up that

Iir. Harochini's capable of performing, we will be glad to consider

him for it.

Since he has been over here nunerous times recently

and there has been no significant change in employment requirements

that would benefit Nir. Marochini, I advised Mr. Delaha that I diu

not feel that an interview was warranted at this time.

I advised him that we would continue to review Mir. Harochini's

skilled employment requirements were becoming very infrequent

because of the status of the program. I asked fir. Delaha if he

would please talk to fir. Marochini and acknowledge our receipt oi

his letter requesting an interview and to relay the information

that he (lir. Delaha) and I had discussed over the phone.

Your additional request for further oportunity for betterment within Chrysler

Corporation is commendable. However, some salient points of our endeavors in

your behalf are evidently being overlooked on your part and I should like to

being ever looked

remind you again of the following efforts in this respect:

(a) Your previous requests have been promptly processed through all

levels of supervision up to the Personnel Placement Graup for

review and consideration.

(b) Personal interviews have been arranged for you to present your

case directly to these same levels of supervision and channels

of personnel communication.

(c) No effort has been made to hold you in the current job or

classification, department or area of endeavor.

(d) Your personnel records, updated to your specifications, are

in the hands of the proper Personnel Department employees for

further processing.

In view of the above actions, communications and personal interviews

exhausting all possible avenues of stating your desires in this matter

to the proper parties, my only reply can be to the effect that the matter is

in the proper hands of our Personnel Placement Section.
