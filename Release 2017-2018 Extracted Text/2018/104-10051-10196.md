Uitically and enctionally, to be permitted to become any further involved in

3+ The very fact that 2/5» © NUBAKE agent, and GULUB, 2 known Bisnis. ~
are ‘in contact with each other, has implications which warrant close scrutiny.
Whils it may be a bit too early to ponder the direction GULUB's interest could
take, (Ge SOLIB sizing wp 4/5 for recrutinent, or ie he falling for her, gem~

inely?) the following comments are offered in the knowledge that they ate, by
and large, self-evident. GOLUS has taken the intiative in contact
with A/S, which follows the not uneesmen modus operandi of a gift, dimers,
movies, an appeal to the intellest, language lessons, and a little Liaison
initiated through the "Jilted husband" routine. All of these
revolved around 4/5's spartment, which the question of 1)
roomate. It would be odd to us if a natix sbaring an
an American, wouldn't be suspicious of a Soviet coming to the apartment for

etc. Perhape Costille has already satisfied himself on this point, but Heade
quarters would appreciate being assured of the roommate's sjatus and relishility.

whether they are students of Soviet affairs, or of the Russian language, etc.)
what the backgrounds are of the AIS officers rumring the operations, and related =~

vagainst the AIS, since he, as KGB Rezident would have broader responsibilities.

pressions.’ It might be interesting to see whether after a while he turns over
the Costille contact to someone else, such as Viktor Natveyevich ZPGAL, to whom
he hag introduced Costille. In this context, it is interesting te consider the
Eubassy report received as an attackment to OFHA-l)067, In this report, Costille,
says that CHALKOVSEIY, ZEUAL and GOLUB seem to be maintaining the majority of
contacts with Americans. Some time ago we at Headquarters wondered if CHALKOVSKIY
wight Same specialize in American contacts, since he was the one who took

over thi contact. And ZEOAL has spent considerable time in the United
States, 50 be someting of an American specialist, too.

5. It is difficult to say whether the following is relevant or not, but we

USSR is a spy. Here we have the suspect KGB Rezidents in two Scandinavian countries
sinaltaneously expressing the same thoughts to and about Americans. We realize
that one shouldn't try to make too much out of these coincidences, but it is worth
that in Demmark the KGB Rezident has subsequently turned over the contact
with the AIS officer to an underling at the sams tims that GOLUB is introducing
Costille to ZEGAL who may, in turn, carry on the contacts. We plan to piint out
this coincidence to thel

6. To get back to the cass in point: The pattern of a/5's contacts with
GOLUB suggests that the latter has spotted and is in the process of assessing, and
cultivating A/5. It may be that GOLUB is trying to involve A/5 in a romantic re~
‘lationship in which emotional control could be exercised, since it is quite un
Likely that this shrewd intelligence operator "likes her for her mind". It would
also seem that the Soviets have a continuing interest in Costille’ and assuming
that they are aware of at least some of the Costille~A/5 contacts, thsy may have
in mind recruiting 4/5 tog information on Coatille and other American targets.
GOLUB certainly appears to be trying to get 4/5 on the “hook!, be it for herself
or toget information on the AIS, or both.

7» Costille says he has never been seen with A/S and that all contact with
har has been held in his apartment or car. However, it appeare quite possible
that their meetings have been observed, if the RIS had an inclination to do so,
and it may well. be that GOLUB is aware of the contact. It is requested that
Costille advise Headquasters, for record purposes, as to the means of contact
employed by him and A/5: telephone, meeting plans for a certain day ofeach week
or alternate days, etc. Also, does she come unaccompanied to his apartment efor
does ha mest her at a designated place, what is the usual hour (daylightor dark),
guration of visit; if meeting is in his car, where do they meet, do they drive
around, where does he drop her off? All of this could be surveilled by the Sovicts,
if they were so inclinéd.

8, If our suspicion is correct that GOLUB has A/S and Costille tabbed, from a
CE standpoint it would be appropriate to .discourage any further contact between
«A/5 and GOLUB. He might just contime to fish around for occasional Items of
operational intelligence, and wa ses nothing to be gained from the contact. A/S
might have enough of a sense of mission to allow herself to be egged on into a
conversation from which GOLUB would derive more benefit than she or we. If GOLUB
«wants to defect, he won't need A/5's help, and he's probably too sharp, and she
too untutored, for us to be the winner in a continuation of this relationship.
alt this point, it is suggested that Costille himself ‘be careful in his relations’:
arith GOLUB and report indstall on all such contacts.
