the gist of the consensus of opinion derived theretrol.

Putting firut things firat, It ia belloved that AEPAWNSE/5 (referre

reasoning 1s as follow.

3. The very fact that A/5, & SUBARK agent, and GOLUB, a known RISik,

are 'in contact with each other, has implications which warrant close scrutiny.

While it may be & bit too early to ponder the direction GOLUBts interest could

take, (Is GOLUB sizing up N5 for recrudtaent, or is he falling for her, gen

Inely?) the fallowing comments are offered in the knowledge that they are, by

and large, self-evidente Goals has taken the intrative in wintaining contact

with 4/5, which followy the not meamen modus operandl of a gift, dirers,

movies, an appeal to the intelleet, language lessons, and a little liaison

quarters wonld appreciate being assured of the rocatels status and reliabllity.

4o GOLD has made provocative remarks to both A5 and Costille, including

sona pertaining to the 1/5 Gostille relationship, A/5's trip to the

USSBig the

likellhood that COLUBig contact with A/5 had come to the attention of the US.

Embassy with resultant inquiries instigated by Costille, and to the possibility

that A/S was reporting on her contact with GOLUB to the U.S. Embassy.

doubtedly the thought has occurred to the station that COLU may well have

costille tabbed as an als offleer specialtring in RedSkiN type operations

As

you will, recally in a couple of instances COLUB hinted to A/5 that he suspected

that someone else was paying for her trip to the USSR when he asked her to when

did she have to account for her expenditures.

Some of the things GOLUB might

hope to gadn from these contactsy assuning that be is susploious of both Costille

and A/5, ares an indication of the type of people PBPRIME sends on REDSKTH

missions, what their backgrounds are and perhapa how they are spotted (a.5.;

what the backgrounds are of the ATS officers ruming the operations,

vagainst the AlS, since he, as kis Rexident would have broader responsibilities.

However, he might well be interested in "keeping his hand in" and of naintaiming

pressions. It might be interesting to see whether after a while he turns over

the Costille contact to someone else, such as Viktor Matreyevich ZIGAL,

he has introduced Costille. In this context, it is interesting to consider the

Embassy report received as an attachment to OFHA-4067. In this report, Costille,

says that CHALKOVSKTY, ZEGAL, and GOLUB seem to be maintaining the majority of

contacts with Anericans. Some time ago we at Headquarters wondered 11 CHALNUVSHLI

might be plaming to specialise in Americaa contacts, since he was the one who took

And ZEGAL, has spent considerable time in the united:

States, so he right be something of an American specialist, too.

5. It is difficult to say whether the following is relevant or not, but we

were interested toroad a recent

dispatch concerning & luncheon ir

volving a KuBArker and two known ris orlicers. At this luncheon the suspect KGB

Rezident in Denmark alleged that one out of every three American Visitors to the

USSR 1a a spy. Here we have the suspect KGB Residents in two Scandinavlan countries

simltanecusly expressing the same thoughts to and about Americans. We realize

that ons shouldn't try to make too much out of these coincidences, but It is worth

noting that in Dermark the KgB Rexident has subseguently turned over the contact

with the AlS officer to an underling at the same time that GOLUB is Introducing

Costille to LEGAl, who mays in turny carry on the contacts. We plan to point out

this coincidence to the

6. To get back to the case in points

The pattern of A/5's contacts with

suggests that the latter bas spotted and 1s in the process of assessings and

cultivating A/5. It may be that GOLUB is trying to involve N/5 in a romantic re-

Lationship in which emotional control could be exercised, since it is quite un

Iikely that this shrewd Intelligence operator "likes her for her mind". It would

also seem that the Soviets have a contiming interest in Costille and assuning

that they are aware of at least some of the Costille A/5 contacts, thy may have

in mind recruiting A/5 togot information on Costille and other American targets.

GOLUB certainly appears to be trying to get A/5 on the "booky, be it for herself

or to get information on the AIS, or both,

7. Costille says he has never been seen with A5 and that all contact with

her has been held in his apartment or car.

However, It appears quite possible

that their meetings have been observed, 1f the RIS had an inclination to do so,

and it may well be that GOLJB is aware of the contact.. It is requested that

Costille advise Headquarters, for record purposes, as to the means of contact

employed by him and 4/5: telephone, meeting plans for a certain day ofeach week

or alternate days, etc.

Also, does she come unaccompanied to his apartment e or

does ba meet her at a designated place, what is the usual hour (daylightor dari)s

duration of visit; il meeting Is in his car, where do they meet, do theydrive

around, where does he drop her off? All of this coold be surveilled by the Sovlets,

8. Il our suspicion ia correct that COLus has A/5 and Costille tabbed, from a

CE standpoint it wonid be appropriate to discourage agy further contact between

cA/5 and GOLUB.

he might just contime to fish around for occasional items of

operational intelligence, and we see nothing to be gained from the contacte

might have enough of a sense of mission to allow herself to be egged on into a

conversation from which COLUB would derive more benefit than she or we.

If GOLUB

wants to defect, he won't need A/S's help, and he's probably too sharp, and she

too untutored, for us to be the winner in a contimation of this relationship.

At this point, lt is suggested that Costille himself be careful In his relations!
