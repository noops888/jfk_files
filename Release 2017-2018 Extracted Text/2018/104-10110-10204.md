At Miami Beach, Florida

Acting Special Agent in Charge, Richard BAKER, of the Miani
FRI was contacted in his office, third floor, Justice Building,
3915 Biscayne Blvd., at 0955 hours, 25 July 1960, by the Reporting
Agent and FOB Security Officer, Jobn J. SULLIVAN. Mr. SULLIVAN
briefed Mr. BAKER why we were there and requested that he furnish
any information available relative to the incident that occurred
at the University Court Resort Motel on 19 July 1960. Mr. BAKER
et 1005 hours requested FBI Special Agent George DAVIS, the in-
vestigator handling this matter, to participate in the discussion.

Special Agent DAVIS indicated that at 1500 hours on 19 July
1960 @ call was received from Mrs. Clark VALENTINER, wife of an
executive of the Continental Can Company, Havana, Cuba, who re-
ported that she had overheard a discussion of an anti-CASTRO group.
At this point, Me. DAVIS pointed out thet his detailed report on
this matter which is incorporated in a larger report dealing with
unsolicited information, was forwarded to the FBI Headquarters
on Saturday, 23 July 1960. DAVIS added that the only matter that
he did not include in his investigative report was tvo license
plates mmbers which Mrs. VALEIIINER hed provided him. Mra.
VALENTOUER had noted the license plates of the participants in
the meeting conducted in Room 209 at the University Court Resort
Motel.



feso0o 2 August 1560

Shortly after the call was received by the FBI fron Mrs.
VALENTDNSR, FSI. Special Agemt Howard ALBAUGH informed "Eernie"
RELCHSARDT of the aforementioned telephone call. “Bernie” sub-
sequently asked Special Agent DAVIS to contact Mrs. VALENTINSR
for the purpose of determining what she had overheard, refrain
from discussing this matter further with anyone, and.also to
caution her friends whon she had told of the incident to do lite-
wise. ;

Special Agent DAVIS mentioned that Mrs. VALBIFIINEN hed
returned to her room, 210, at the University Court Resort Hotel
at 1130 hours, 19 July 1960, and noticed bellows of cigar amoke
emanating from underneath her kitchen door. Upon examining the
situation, she overheard low conversing in the connecting roan.
In listening further, Mrs. VALENTINER was able to record the
conversation in Reon 209 by taking copious notes. Mra. VALENTINER
believed there were three Cubans present together with two other
individuals whose nationality she could not determine but whose
names she established to be Frank HEIDER and “Jimaie." One of .
the Cubans served as an interpreter and BENDER spoke vith a dis-
tinct Germanic. accent. Mrs. VALENTINER told DAVIS that Hr. BENDER
during the meeting had stated that he was "hired by the United
States to do maray with CASTRO." Mrs. VALENTINER also noted during
the meeting references. to Howard and HUHT, which she surmized
to be one Howard HUNT.

Special Agent DAVIS indicated that he interviewed Hrs.
YVALENTINER in her quarters in the motel during the hours 2300 to
O145 on 19 and 20 July 1960. ‘he writer, at thia point, inquired
as to the size of the crack underneath Mrs. VALENTINER's kitchen
door. DAVIS answered by stating that it wes Jarge (exact dimen-
sions not noted). He further declared that she had mentioned to
him that she was able to observe the portion of the leg (to the
imee) of many of the individuals participating in the discussion.
‘The weiter further queried DAVIS as to whether she had any know-
ledge of Spanish. DAVIS replied that she advised him that she
possesses fluent lmowledge of Spanish after having resided in Cuba

+ for ten years. Her husband has lived in Cuba for thirty years.

While at the motel, DAVIS chserved that she had notes of the
conversation which she referred to during the interview. It should
be noted that these notes were not confiscated by DAVIS.

DAVIS stated that Mrs. ROBINSON, who is also a resident of
tha motel, was present during the meeting for a very short pericd
(exact times unimown). Mrs. ROBINSON is the wife of en American
Uusinesaman in Cuba. Mr. Lawrence BREWER of the Esso Company of

Cuba is also knowledgeable of the incident since she called him
for airice. BREWER advised her to call the FBI. She telephoned
the FEL fram the home of Hrs. MORRIS or MORRISON (not further _
identicied).

lies. VALENTINER, accordimg to DAVIS, did a little investigating
on her oyn. After the meeting of the group was over, Frank BENDER
called Sational Airlines to camfirm his reservations for 19 July
1960, Shortly thereafter, Mrs. YVALENTIUER called National Airlines
and dersermined that BENDER wes destined for Washington, D.C, She
also comducted diserset inquimies at the motel ani ascertained
that tine oceupants of Room 20@ were a group of businessmen using —
the remm for the day. Mrs. VA:LENTINER was careful to note the
license: plates of two cars thet were used by the conferees. She
conduezed no further investigation.

Smeeial Agent DAVIS descx-ibed Mra. .VALENTINER as discreet,

cooperracive, intelligent, anct CASTRO, and anti-Commmist, DAVIS

feels <nat this varticular incident will "@tesa natural death"

and thet the people who have irecone knowledgeable to sane extent

of our activity are discreet enough to not discuss it further.
Dering bis discussion with Mem. VALENTINER, DAVIS at no time divulged
any United Statea Goverment mpensorship of this matter.

Acrling Special Agent in Charge Richari BAXER concluded that

.. 28 far 2s the local FBI Office was concerned, this was a closed
matter. He added that any otluer participation by his offtce would

have tw be approved by FAL Hemiquarters,

Ax 1100 hours, 24 July 16:50, the Reporting Agent, unier alias,

Clark WALSNTINER currently occupies roca 210 at this motel where,

hed she elected to Go so,woula be able to cyezhear the entire -
conver=scion in room 209 from ther kitchenette. As will be noted

on the rege 7 diegraa of Ethibtt 46, her kitchen extends three to
four feet (actual measurement) into roo 209. The kitchen door

is of yiyvoed construction. Im building C there is a 3/4 to 1 inch

to Lie. ERCWN, previously identified in this report, tha windows
were closed and the air conditioning vas on when the mestings
were conducted. _

It would be difficult for anyone to monitor the conversation
in recs 209 from either the back or front doors as they are of
gnoked glass construction thereby affording the occupants of the
room to note anyone standing in front of then.
