While at the United Nations in 1961,.OLTMANS claimed.to be an
unattached and unsponsored UN correspondent. He was socially
ostracized by the Nutch delegation and fellow Dutch newsmen at
the United Nations for openly pro-Indonesian public stand and
was not permanently accredited to the United Nations. Dutch
correspondents stated they have never seen one story written by
OLTMANS in the obscure Dutch monthly he ostensible worked for,
nor could OLTMANS produce a single clipping to demonstrate his
journalistic activities. Despite fact his material not printed
OLTMANS traveled extensively and those knowing his personal and
financial status did not believe he would have been able to pay
for these trips even if his stories were selling. He-was viewed
with disfavor in reputable Dutch political and press circles for
his loose handling of the truth.

broadcast by Dutch television Foundation, at top "viewing time.

A calmaand composed GARRISON explained that President Kennedy mur-
dreed because his concept of detent was detrimertal to the "mili-
tary industiral complex". GARRISON repeated well-known thesis Kenned
victim of plot: by CIA, who made common cause with the military-
industrial establishment, with vested interest in keeping cold war
going. GARRISON also stated CIA committeed to Asian land war while
one of President's last orders was for troop reduction tehre. He
predicted that the President who brings US to brink: of peace will
suffer same fate as Kennedy.

When queried about the reason for program, especaally made for a
European audience, GARRISON said the growing CI A influence on US
media made it impossible for him to be heard in his own country.
The interviewer, OTLMANS, charcaterized by former colleagues as
someone "more interested in shady politics than.in journalism.
During the traumatic New Guinea period OLTMANS acted as SUKARNO's
unofficial aid.

person and presentation was sufficiently credible to elicit rather
