MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Operations Staff

SUBJECT : Review of Agency Holdings. regarding.
Photograph of Unidentified Individual
in Mexico City published by the
Warren Commission

REFERENCE : Letter dated 15 April 1975 by
- Mr. David W. Belin, Executive Director
of the Commission on CIA Activities
within the United States, to
* Mr.. E. Henry Knoche (copy attached to
accompanying report)

1. This : is further to, and in completion of, my
interim memorandum of a few weeks ago.

26 The ‘attachment is a detailed review in narrative,
_chronological..order:- together with appropriate comment-
ary - of. our extensive holdings on the OSWALD case that
- have a bearing on the matter of photographs taken by
Mexico: City’ Station on 1, 4 and 15. October 1963 of an
Unidentified. Individual. As a consequence of a combina-
tion. of. analytical error, misjudgement and under the
stress of an urgent desire to. contribute to the develop-
ment of the investigation of the assassination, a
cropped version of one of the photographs.of the
Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of
evidence in- the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an
FBI representative in Dallas. The successive vicissi-
tudes which have now made this event a cause celebre
right down to the present moment are detailed in the
narrative.

3. The attached report is not intended to be an
answer to the Fensterwald/O'Toole article which Mr. Belin
attaches to his memorandum. (I have prepared a paragraph-
by-paragraph refutation dnd comment on that article,
which I believe is more appropriately handled by a sepa~
rate memorandum to Mr. Belin, and I will prepare this as
a memorandum if that is desired.) =

4. The point of. the referenced memorandum is that
consideration should be given now to "whether or\not the
entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time." This
submission is designed to make it possible for you, the
IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this
decision. The narrative-interpretive summary has been
put together in such a way that it discloses no cyptonyms,
pseudonyms or other CIA jargon. However, its contents qo
well beyond what has been released to the public thus far
in the Warren Commission documentation. This point must
be borne .in mind in making a decision on Mr. Belin's
question. To remove any question in anybody's mind about
our good faith in this matter, the narrative is backed up
by copies of actual documentation from our files. It
seems to me necessary, in reply to Mr. Belin, that he or
his representative. review the documentation that backs up
the narrative. The documentation has not been keyed into
the narrative presentation, but it follows the chronologi-
cal order of presentation from 9 October into the latest
developments in the matter, and there is an overall index
to facilitate reference to individual items. [NB: There

is only one copy of this collection; this is it-]

5. As noted above, one of the photographs taken in
Mexico City on.4 October 1963 was introduced into the
Warren Commission public record. ° However, .it was..intro-
duced into that. record in two cropped versions. -The
Warren Commission and its staff were made fully aware in
the course of their inquiry.at Headquarters and in
Mexico City of the origins of the photograph, the fact
that we had additional photographs of the same individual
taken at different times in Mexico City and on the basis
of full knowledge of these facts reached their own con-
clusions regarding the irrelevance of the photograph to
OSWALD and the assassination.

6. In fact, we actually hold twelve different photo-
graphs of the Unidentified Individual. Each of these ag /S
reproduced in the collected documentation backing up the
narrative report (see Items 25 - 27). Chief, LA Division,

had indicated in writing to DC/OPS Staff, that he has no
objection for Mr. Belin to do whatever is desired with
these photographs at this time. It should be noted that
Mx. Fensterwald in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by
Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the
twelve photographs, other than the one already published
in the Warren Commission report. (It is these two that
he has published in The New York Review of Books article
which Mr. Belin attaches to his mémorandun.)

t
7. It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on
whether the entire matter can be fully disclosed at this
time should bear in.mind that a subsidiary decision must
also be made, i.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up

‘the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to

publish. the entire run of the photographs for the first
time without taking out the background. Obviously, none
of these questions apply to the passage of this material
to Mc. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission itself. I
think they should see the entire documentation as it
stands. Perhaps after that, the question of what could
be discussed and the question of “how?" and "how much?"
could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself. My personal
recommendation is that the more we can say about this
matter in a fully open and final manner, the better of F
we will be as an Agency. But it is my understanding

that there are still sensitive.aspects deriving from the
fact that the operation which produced the photographs
was jointly run with Mexican Yiaison and as a consequence
publication at this time would create ‘additional problems
lat that level_in Mexico¢ Also, it should be noted that
the Ambassador, according to Win Scott's memorandum to
J.C. King on22 November 1963. (see ftem 8 in the backup
documentation), “allegedly played a direct role in the
decision to put the photographs into’ the hands of the FBI
in Dallas laterally from the Field. As far as I know,
there has not'.been anything published about this aspect
at any time. in the past nor have we had any discussions
with the State Department about that asyect of the matter.
