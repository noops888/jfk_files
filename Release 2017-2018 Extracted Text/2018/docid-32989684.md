Jx., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the
Department, addressed to John A. Mintz, Assistant Director,
Legal Counsel Division, dated October 3, 1975. The memorandum
instructs the Bureau to provide access to the House Select Com-
mittee Staff Members to the Kissinger 17 material which was
previously made available for review by the Senate Select Com-
mittee. This material is exclusive of logs pertaining to
electronic surveillance matters.

Attached is a memorandum from Michael E. Shaheen, Gf f/
tA

Upon receipt of attached memorandum, SA Paul V. Daly
of this Division telephonically contacted Steven Blackhurst,
Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the
Department, and advised Blackhurst that the instructions insofar
as allowing the House Select Committee Staff Members to-take notes
on the materials and remove these notes without screening by Bureau
personnel back to their offices was contrary to the agreement set.
forth in the Departmental letter to the Senate Select Committee of
July 15, 1975. This letter required prior Bureau screening of
notes taken by Staff Members during their review of the afore-
mentioned material. Blackhurst subsequently advised SA Daly that
the Committee was agreeable to having their notes screened by
Bureau personnel prior to their removal to their offices.
Blackhurst was then informed that inasmuch as this involved the
State Department and the White House, the Department should ad-
vise the appropriate representatives of the White House and the
State Department of the aforementioned matter, especially in view
of information furnished by the Committee indicating that Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger would be testifying in executive session
before the House Select Committee og Friday, October. 31st. 4

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: HOUSTUDY

On 10/30/75, Shaheen telephonically advised SA Daly
that the Committee representatives were on their way with
Blackhurst to Bureau space to review the Kissinger 17 materials
and that Daly was to advise Blackhurst that the Attorney General
had instructed the Committee not be granted access to the materials.
Upon arrival, Staff Members for the House Select Committee John
Atkisson and Timothy Oliphant were advised of the Attorney General's
decision by Blackhurst. Oliphant promptly consulted with Committee
Counsel. Aarron Donner and Donner advised Blackhurst that the Com-
mittee was. considering issuing subpoenas for the material and
would hold a press conference concerning the Department's noncomp-
liance with the Committee request. Blackhurst indicated to SA
Daly that ‘he was not fully cognizant of the background concerning
the Attorney General's instruction; however, apparently the White
House had instructed the Attorney General not to make the material
available. He stated that he had informed the White House of the
aforementioned request and their compliance thereof early on the
morning of October. 30th and that the White House had apparently
telephoned the Department objecting to making the material avail-
able.

Subsequently, Blackhurst telephonically advised SA Daly
that the Attorney General had feviewed the motion to modify the
Protective Order covering the Kissinger 17 documents which was
filed on October 28, 1975, and signed by the Judge on October 29,
1975, which allowed for Housé Select Committeé access to the
documents protected by a Protective Order which was issued by
that court on June 28, 1975, with the exception of electronic
surveillance logs. The Attorney General after this review in-
structed that the material be made available.

The Honorable Edward H. Levi OCT 2 3 197%
Attorney General
U.S. Department of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530 O.LA,

Dear Mr. Levi:

One of the objectives of this Committee is to establish
the cost of domestic intelligence. This letter is to request
that you provide FY 76 budget numbers (dollars and manpower)
concerning intelligence activities and intelligence related
activities within your Department. Should this kind of data
not be readily available, by Department, Bureau, Administration,
etc., your best estimate and an explanation as to how the
computations were made will suffice. We have a good deal of
budgetary data re: FBI, DEA, etc. already. However, it is in
a format that does not readily lend itself to isolating intelli-
gence activities per se, hence this request.

Should there be any questions regarding this matter, Roger
Carroll of this staff, at 225-9751, is available for more
details. We would appreciate your response by October 31, 1975.

Sincerely,

A. Searle Field
Staff Director.

RE: REQUEST FOR FBI MATERIALS
RELATING TO ALLEGED TLLEGAL
WIRETAP ON TELEPHONE OF
HARRY £, KAPLEAN

Reference is made to HSC letter dated September 9,
1975, requesting "a copy of any information, reports or
memoranda concerning an illegal wiretap on the phone of
Me. Harry BE. Kaplean, Chairman of the Pennsylvania State
Milk Marketing Board.”

Review of records of the FBI reveals that the
Harry EH. Kaplean referred to in referenced HSC letter of
September 9, 1975, appears te be identical with information
located in FBI files concerning Harry E. Kapleau, Chairman
of Pennsylvania State Milk Marketing Board,

In response to referenced USC inquiry, there
aré attached two pieces of correspondence concerning Kepleau
which represent the only information located in FBI
\o Headquarters files concerning any alleged illegal wiretapping
on the telephone of that individual.

The subject matter of this particular request concerns — -

Interception of Commuriications violation which possibly occurred |
in 1972. House Resolution 591, which created the HSC, apparently -
restricts its authority insofar as an inquiry is concerned
to intelligence operations. In view of this mandate, it vost)
not appear appropriate for the HSC to inquire into possible
eriminal violations referred to this Bureau such as the subject
matter of HSC inquiry set forth in referenced letter of
September 9, 1975. It is requested that the Department make
a determination as to whether the enclosures shold be furnished

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

On 10/10/75, Congressman Robert McClory, HSC
Member, along with representatives of the HSC Staff, were
briefed in general terms by representatives of the Intelligence
Division concerning the manner in which Bureau electronic
surveillances were conducted., On 10/15/75, the HSC by letter
(which the Department advises was personally approved by
Representative McClory) modified their letter of 8/19/75 by
limiting theirrequest to a list of all electronic surveillances
conducted by this Bureau against "domestic targets" during
the period 1970-1975. This latter request for the specific
identity of such targets was appealed to the Department in
view of the AG's prior decision to furnish the HSC only
with supportive documents relating to these operations,
appropriately excised so as not to identify the target,

On 10/20/75, Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, Department of Justice,
advised that the above matter had been taken up with-the AG
who requested that, prior to making a decision as to whether
or not to accede to the latest HSC request, he desired
this Bureau to furnish him with:

1. A list of all United States citizens and ©
organizations which were the subjects of Bureau electronic
surveillance during the period in question where there was
no imdi¢ation of foreign contacts and indicating which
surveillances had become public knowledge, and

2. Alist of all United States citizens and
organizations which were the subjects of Bureau electronic
surveillance during the period in question in which foreign
contacts were involved again indicating which surveillances
had become public knowledge.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

OBSERVATIONS :

Surveillance against "domestic targets" wherein
there is no indication of foreign contacts has been
prohibited by the Keith Decision in 1972 and, consequently,
no such surveillances were conducted by this Bureau after
that date. There is attached in response to the AG request
three lists setting forth the identity of United States
citizens and organizations which were the targets of Bureau
electronic surveillances during the period 1970-1975, In
addition to the above two requested lists, it was deemed
advisable to furnish the AG with a third list identifying
those surveillances which are currently in litigation, as
well as similar surveillances which could be affected by
the outcome of such litigation, as it appears that a court
ruling in such matters will eventually involve a decision
as to the extent of foreign contacts, if any, involved in
these operations.

‘RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached three lists of Bureau~conducted
electronic surveillances of United States citizens and
organizations conducted during the years 1970-1975 be
provided the AG in accordance with his aboveestated request.,

On the late afternoon of October 11, 1975, Douglas Marvin, Special t A

Assistant to the Attorney General, called me and requésted that the mn
Attorney General be furnished a brief statement concerning FBI relation- ‘
ships with the Senate Select Committee and the House Select Committee
for inclusion in a statement being prepared for submission to the White
House. Mr. Marvin said that the Attorney General's intention was to
bring together anticipated problems concerning the two committees in the
hope that a means for resolving these matters might be found.

I discussed this request with Mr. Jenkins in the absence of
Mr. Callahan and I returned Mr. Marvin's call and dictated to the
Attorney General’s secretary. I requested her to furnish me with a copy
of the dictation. Attached is the page furnished by the Attorney General's.
secretary which I received on October 15, 1975. L

This matter was brought to the attention. of the Executives Contefence

FBI Relationships with the Senate and ‘House Select Committees

Senate Select Committee

FBI relationships with the Senate Select Committee generally

: have been harmonious with responses to the Committee requests
delivered promptly. When difficulties have occurred they
have been overcome by negotiation and tolerance on both sides.
Future difficulties that may be confronted and require similar
resolution include the scope of any public hearing regarding
electronic surveillance of foreign nationals or their agents
and establishments.

House Select Committee

In the past the FBI has experienced the following difficulties
with the House Select Committee:

(1) It has held public hearings which were orchestrated
to present adverse views without an opportunity for
prepared rebuttal, such as occurred on October 9, 1975,
regarding electronic surveillance matters;

(2) It has demanded delivery of documents on unreas-
onably short notice considering the time necessary to
locate and prepare for deliverythe enormous quantity
of documents called for;

(3) It has interviewed employees, former employees
and confidential sources of the FBI without’ first
advising the FBI of the proposed interview and has
demanded .the appearance of agents below the policy-
making level.

A large number of documents'dealing with electronic surveillance
conducted without a warrant between 1970 and July 30, 1975, were
furnished to the Committee on Friday, October 10, 1975. Certain
excisions in these documents were made and it remains to be seen
whether the Committee will accept the determinations made as to
what types of information, e.g., identities of subjects who were
monitored, should have been excised.

The overriding concern for the future is the need to establish

an understanding on both sides of the policies to be followed by
each in responding to the Committee's mandate. General agreement
to specified operating procedures would alleviate the suspicion
on the part of the Committee and the fear of Committee seesponsi-
bility on the part of the FBI. ivte

a On October 9, 1975, pursuant to a request of the Committee, ae
Supervisor James Kraus, of the General Investigative Division, appeared

as a witness to testify concerning the Bureau's work in interception of
communications investigations. Also appearing as witnesses were Anthony J. P.
Farris, “former United States Attorney; Anthony V. Zavala, former Houston
Police Department officer; Michael J. Hershman, former Chief Investigator

for the National Commission for the Review of Federal and State Laws

Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance; and Martin L. Kaiser,

the owner of a corporation which specializes in the development and manufacture
of electronic surveillance and counter-measure equipment.

Efforts were made on the evening of October 8th, with the prior

approval of the Deputy Attorney General, to substitute a Bureau official

for Mr. Kraus as the Committee witness, however, the Committee refused i a

to agree to such substitution. Assistant Director Gallagher and I accompanied

Mr. Kraus and during the course of the testimony Mr. Kraus consulted with

me concerning appropriate responses. On my recommendation, Mr. Kraus i

advised the Committee that his appearance had been required by the Committee"
in the face of the Bureau's offer to provide testimony by Bureau officials, and
further that Bureau officials were available to respond to the Committee

questions. Again, the Committee rejected that offer. As explained at the

conclusion of the hearing by Chief Counsel A. Searle Field, the Committee

intentionally called a Unit Chief in order to have his testimony : as to the

operations of the unit which specifically supervises IOC inves Ae if 3B Be

STATEMENT OF ANTHONY J. P. FARRIS,
Former United States Attorney for the
Southern District of Texas
Before the
Select Committee on Intelligence
October 9, 1975

Mr. Chairman, my name is Anthony J. P. Farris, and I
am an attorney with Farris, Pain & Horne in Houston. From
February 14, 1969 to December 30, 1974, I served as United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, with the principal

office in Houston. The District, is the eighth largest of the 94.

I understand I am here to testify about allegations of
illegal electronic surveillance by local law enforcement authorities
in Houston, Texas, about the lack of aggressiveness by the FBI -
in investigating those allegations, about allegations that the

"FBI and DEA had known about illegal electronic surveillance by
Houston Police Department officers and neither investigated them
nor reported them, and about allegations that both FBI and DEA
agents had either participated in illegal electronic surveillance,

or at ‘least witnessed it.

These matters first came to light when the IRS commenced

an investigation of a big-time heroin dealer in Houston in 1971.

That investigation led the IRS into an investigation of illegal
electronic surveillance by certain members of the Houston Police
Department. The latter investigation commenced in September of

1972 and resulted in indictments of nine officers in May of 1974.

When -the allegations of Houston Police Department illegal
electronic surveillance began to surface in the late summer and

a | oe @

early fall of 1973, my chief assistants and I commenced commun-
ication with the FBI in Houston about these possible violations
and started to send material to the FBI. Allegations then
commenced about participation in illegal electronic surveillance
by the FBI and DEA. ‘In preliminary and pretrial hearings in

the case of U.S. vs. Dudley Clifford Bell, Jr. in November of

1973, counsel for Defendant alleged. that the PBI Special Agent

in Charge knew about the Houston Police Department's illegal
activities and did not investigate them. He also alleged that
electronic eavesdropping equipment had been sold to. a named FBI
agent in Houston and that federal funds had gone to the purchases
of equipment for electronic surveillance purposes by local law
enforcement entities. I sent a copy of that transcript to the
FBI SAC in Houston sometime in the fall of 1973 and to Washington

in 1974.

The District Attorney of Harris County (Houston) sent two
of his assistants to discuss allegations of illegal wiretapping
with the FBI SAC in Houston in the fall of 1973. In short, the
FBI in Houston had information before them of probative value
of. allegations of illegal electronic surveillance by local and

federal’ authorities in the fall of 1973.

The investigation being conducted by the IRS in the fall
of 1973 resulted in indictments of seven Houston Police officers
and two former police officers in early 1974. From late 1973

until early 1974 I attempted to keep the same IRS agents on the

investigation of the Houston Police Department with the idea in

NW 55292 DocId:32989684 Page 93



mind that it was really an on-going investigation. Commissioner
Alexander denied that request through his assistants because the
IRS is chartered to investigate only Title 26 matters. From late
1973 to April, 1974, my chief assistants and I continued to
communicate with the FBI in Houston relative to the Houston Police
Department electronic surveillance and.we did so by telephone,
in person and in writing. In April, 1974, we sent a lengthy
letter with exhibits to the FBI SAC in Houston and asked him
formally, firmly and in writing to commence his investigation if
he had not already done so. A copy of this lengthy letter and
copies of the exhibits were sent to the General Crime Section in
the Department of Justice in Washington. The FBI only saw fit to i
assign one agent to this complex investigation of the country's
fifth largest police department. This FBI agent submitted reports
to our office which were notable only in their lack of substance,
: FO saws atte .
depth, and consisted (largely)of Xeroxed newspaper articles. We
continued to communicate in writing, by telephone and in person
with the FBI in Houston urging them to give us something to" work
on and my then Assistant Chief of Criminal spoke in blunt English
to the lone agent assigned to this matter. In June, 1974, a new
SAC had taken over in the Houston office of the FBI. Our letters,
memos and phone calls to the FBI in Houston continued unabated,
with copies to Washington, through December, 1974. There was no
noticeable increase in quantity or quality of the FBI reports
received by us. In the latter part of 1974, the new Police Chief,

Carroll Lynn, gave us additional information about allegations of

NW 55292 DocId:32989684 Page 94



Houston Police Department illegal electronic surveillance, about
allegations that the FBI and DEA had participated in illegal
electronic surveillance and that the FBI and DEA haa known about
these illegal activities and had done nothing about them. ,/ We
passed these allegations on to an FBI inspector visiting in
Houston in late October or early November, 1974 and to.the~

General Crime Section of the Department of Sustice.

Finally, in Decmeber, 1974, unable to get cooperation from
the FBI in Houston, I wrote a lengthy letter to Attorney General
Saxbe with copies to the Deputy Attorney General,the Assistant
Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division, and to the
General Crime Section recapitulating every point I could think
of and sending as exhibits copies of all the correspondence with |
the FBI, copies of the transcripts of the Dudley Bell hearings
and copies of the teangerines oe the recordings made by Chief

Lynn of his own men.

I know of my own knowledge that the investigation of the
Houston Police Department matters, as conducted by the FBI through
1974, would rate one on a scale of ten. I know of my own

knowledge that when there were hijacking and kKidnapp cases in

Houston the FBI had brought ‘in many agents from other offices and

I know of no FBI policy that would forbid bringing in agents from

other FBI offices to help out in the Houston Police Department
case. I know of no internal investigation having been conducted
by the FBI of either the type of investigation conducted by the

‘ FBI of the Houston Police Department or of allegations of illegal

NW 55292 DocId:32989684 Page 95



“»  -, @ —

electronic surveillance by fedéral officers. I do know personally
that through December 30, 1974, the General Crime Section of

the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice showed very
little interest in the investigation of this country's Eifth
largest police department or of the allegations that federal
agents had actually witnessed illegal electronic surveillance

‘ activities and had done nothing about them.

In closing, I would once again bring up a suggestion that
the PBI bring in agents from other offices to investigate
allegations of illegal activities by local law enforcement officers.
This was first suggested by five U.S. Attorneys, in Arizona in
1973, while meeting with Bill Cleveland of the FBI. : Mr. Cleveland
indicated to us that he interpreted our suggestion as an affront i
to the integrity of the FBI. We repeated this suggestion in a
report to the Attorney General early in 1974 and two of us repeated
ae to Clarence Kelley in New Orleans in September, 1974 at the
U.S. Attorneys' Conference. I personally repeated it to two
committees here in Washington this year and am repeating it once

again now. .



STATEMENT OF ANTHONY V. ZAVALA “
Former Officer, Narcotics Divi-
sion, Houston Police Department .
Before the. :
Select Committee on Intelligence
October 9, 1975

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, my name is
Tony Zavala. I want to thank the Committee for giving me this
chance to testify today, and I hope I can help in your investi-
gation. I also hope that by telling you what I know, I can
help other police officers from falling into the same trap
that I did---learning to break laws, and winding up on my way

to prison.

I am a former police officer with the Houston Police
Department, narcotics division. I joined the Department in

1965. JI started in narcotics in 1967, where I’ stayed until

1973, when I was suspended preceeding my indictment in 1974

on wiretapping charges. In June of 1975 I pled guilty to one
count of wiretapping. Three weeks ago I was sentenced to |
three years in Federal prison. I begin my prison -term one week

from next Tuesday.

During my work with narcotics at the Houston Police De-
partment I became more and more involved with wiretapping.
The first time was in early 1968, when one of my supervisors
ordered me to monitor a conversation from an empty building in
downtown Houston. The last time was in 1972, when I monitored
conversations in a narcotics case, where because of the wire-

tapping involved, all charges against the suspect were dismissed.

Nw 55292 ee aE 97 ENCLOSURE] b2 Me to¢~ = .



In between, from 1968 to 1972, I was personally involved in

about 35 illegal wiretaps.

Mine was not an unusual case. Over time, as the twenty

or so narcotics officers I worked with talked castally at

‘ police headquarters, I'’learned that other officers were. doing
it too--just about all the other officers. I would estimate
that during the time I was there, the narcotics division
conducted somewhere between 700 and a thousand illegal wire-
taps. ,

And there were other divisions using wiretaps: intelli-
gence, vice, homicide, burglary and theft. Again, I know this -
only through the casual talk of many fellow officers at head~-
quarters. But we all talked, every day. We would talk about i
our cases---the names, who we were tapping, what we were hearing,
how it was working out.

And while we talked, members of other agencies---Federal
agencies, like BNDD and the FBI---would walk in and ‘walk out,
and participate in the conversations.

While I cannot point to any one specific conversation
with any one particular FBI agent, for example, I know that it
was all discussed freely, and that everyone. knew what was going

on. Wiretapping, in fact, became second nature to us all.

“So that the Committee may have’ some idea of the modus
operendi of tapping in Houston, I will describe our procedures.
When one of'us wanted a tap, we would ask ‘one of our supervisors--
a Sergeant, a Lieutenant, or a Captain. If the supervisor

approved, and he always did, he would telephone someone I

a 55292" Dold: 32989684 Page 98



. 3.
e .@

happen to know at Southwestern Bell Telephone Company for”
the particular "cable and ‘pair information" we needed for the
tap. The individual at the phone company routinely

supplied what we needed a short time later. He would call
the supervisor usually; but sometimes he would call back
directly to officers like me.

The "cable and pair" information would include a specific.
location where the tap was to be installed. That information
would be given to another officer who was assigned to actually
install the tap--usually on a telephone pole. Later, ‘the field
officer, like me, was told he could go ahead and monitor, and
that's what he did.

Sometimes we would lose a tap. That. is, Telephone Com-
pany workmen would discover a tapping device. They would call
us, ask if we had lost the device, and return it without another
word.. :

The Telephone Company was involved in other ways too. We

used to attend narcotics training seminars... I did not think it

was strange at the time, but there was always a Southwestern

Bell representative there. He would offer complete cooperation

“in our enforcement efforts. Any information we needed, he said,

_we could have.

The equipment for these taps was produced by our own police
department. It was manufactured, fas a matter of fact, on the
sixth floor of headquarters. That also was common knowledge
among us all, and the Federal men who frequented our headquarters.

I myself have been in that sixth floor facility many times.

[NW 55292 Docld:32989684 Page 99



e : e 4.

” The guys a actually installed le taps were well
trained, and the training was always being. updated. The
supervisors wanted everybody to be able to install a tap,
but that meant climbing poles, and some of us were afraia
of heights. I remember a Sergeant announcing that a pole-
climbing school would be started in the department to take

care of that. But it never got going.

Mr. Chairman, I understana the Committee is interested

in Federal officers' direct participation in wiretaps. r
heard about many cases from fellow police officers. But Es
that is hearsay. I have more direct knowledge.

"On one occasion--in 1969--I was assigned by a Captain
to monitor a tap in a drug case. It was a lengthy tap. My
job was to monitor on nights and weekends. One night a fellow
police officer introduced me to several Federal narcotics
agents, two of whom I got to know pretty well, as they kept
coming and going, and listening with me to the conversations
of the target. Some weeks later the suspect in the. case a
arrested--by the Federal agents, incidentally--and afterwards
the three of us were discussing the wiretap at police headquarters. .
“My two Federal friends were disturbed because the entire
conversation took place in front of a high ranking BNDD
supervisor. They said I shouldn't-talk about wiretapping in
front of him that way. .The supervisor was smiling the whole

time.

. 55292 DocId:32989684 Page 100



e € 5.

"In 1971, I conducted a wiretap on a narcotics suspect for
about two months, During the whole two-month period I supplied

the content of the tap to a United States Customs agent.

In 1972 and 1973, I worked as 7 DALE taskforce officer,
‘auring which time my paycheck came from LEAA. In one case I
remember I attempted to obtain legal wiretap authorizations,
through the Federal authorities I was working with. After ‘awhile,
I was told a effect that the "Title III procedures were too
much of a hassle" and that I would have to "do it in another

way. ‘I definitely understood the word "it" to mean the wire-
tap I wanted. Later, I did conduct a wiretap in that case,
without going through any Title III procedures.

ae hehe like to say also, while I was working with DALE's
Federal men, there were many conversations about my anaes

cases. It was never said in so many words, but I am sure it’

was understood that wiretaps were being conducted.

As time went on, late in my work with the Department, the
secrecy and the lying became a real burden for me. I wanted out.
I tried several times to get transferred. But it never worked
out. The. Feds started to get interested too.

Once, in 1972, the FBI apparently started an javestigation.
But in that. case our department conveniently knew about it in
advance. One of my superiors told us to "knock off the wiretaps
for awhile; I just got the word from the Feds; a taskforce is in
“town ready to arrest anybody it finds wiretapping--even police

officers." That happened a couple of times.

STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. HERSHMAN 4
‘ BEFORE
HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

October 9, 1975

Mr.’ Chairman and Members of the Committee. Thank you

very much for the opportunity to appear before you this morning.

For a period of fourteen months I served as the Chief
Investigator for the National Commission for the Review of
Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic
Surveillance. The "National Wiretap Commission" was established
to conduct a comprehensive study and review of the operation and
application of the electronic surveillance provisions of the

Omnibus Crime Bill enacted in 1968.

I would like to direct my introductory remarks to the

problem of illegal electronic surveillance. During my tenure

at the National Wiretap Commission the question most frequently
asked of me concerned the frequency of illegal wiretapping and
bugging in the United States. Although some individuals profess
to have an answer to this question, no-one can really know.
The nature of illegal electronic surveillance is such that most

] individuals remain unaware of their victimization. Furthermore,
many of those who do discover that they have been bugged or
tapped are reluctant to report it, because of embarrassment,
“publicity and a fear of subsequent investigations. These factors
combine to make it virtually impossible to estimate how much

wiretapping is taking place.

NW 55292 Docld:32989684 Page 103


However, we do know that illegal electronic surveillance

takes place, and there is evidence to indicate that it has
not substantially declined since enactment of the Federal Wiretap
Act in 1968. The motivations and incentives for illegal wire-”
tapping have not significantly changed; illegal electronic
surveillance remains an inexpensive and effective technique to
gather information. In addition, it is a crime in which the

rewards generally outweigh the risks.

Before going further, I would like to put my remarks in
perspective. Wiretapping and bugging occurs, but certainly not
to the degree claimed by many. We find that most of the individuals
claiming massive eavésdropping are in the business of de-bugging,

or selling de-bugging equipment.

Perhaps the most interesting point is that most of the

illegal wiretapping and bugging that takes place in the United: States
today occurs in the private sector, and that most of it has nothing

to do with preventing crime. Eavesdropping devices are targeted on

employee dishonesty, on. husbands and wives, political, information,
industrial espionage, courtship situations, and illegal police

surveillance.

The significant point is that there is apparently little
attempt by the federal government to curb these invasions of our
personal privacy, or to curb the multi-million dollar traffic in
spy devices. The FBI is supposed to be in charge, but the stories

of blatant abuse go on and on.

A recent case illustrates the point. In 1974, a Florida
man in the middle of a divorce proceeding secreted a tape
recorder equipped with ‘an automatic activator under a night table.
in the bedroom of his home and connected the device to the
telephone wires. When asked about the purchase of the equipment,~
the husband stated that after having seen the equipment in a

j : sales catalogue he "walked into a retail store and bought ieee
The automatic activator, a device which allows for self-starting

ena stopping, cost $25.00 and the instructions explained how it
should be hooked across the telephone wires and plugged into the

tape recorder.

The tap, which was instituted in order to gain advantage
- in a child custody battle, was discovered by the wife who reported
it to the telephone company. The husband was sentenced by a

state court to six months probation.

To give some idea of how easy and widespread illegal

electronic surveillance is in the United States today, I would .

L- like to report the results of an investigative study just completed
i by the Wiretap Commission. The purpose.of the survey was to
determine the types of electronic surveillance and countermeasures
available to the general public and to determine the number of
‘private investigators willing to discuss, even in the course of

a simple telephone request, installing illegal eavesdropping

devices.

115 private investigating firms were contacted, in seven

‘cities. 42 either offered to perform illegal wiretapping and

[Nw 55292 Docld:32989684 Page 105



bugging themselves or referred the caller to- another agency

that would provide the illegal service. Approximately a dozen |
firms indicated they would be willing to discuss the subject 3£

the caller would come in to the office. The remaining firms :
indicated that they would only engage in de-bugging. The estimated
costs of bugging or wiretapping ranged from $30 to $5,000, and ;
suggested methods ranging from simple tape recorders to a closed

circuit T.Vv.

When we speak of electronic surveillance, we cannot
consider the act without some mention of the tools. There is,
and always has been, ‘a proliferation of devices on the American ft

market which are readily adaptable to eavesdropping.

Alarmingly, some of these devices are advertised, contrary
to Federal laws, in popular periodicals. The manufacturers
attempt to disguise their eavesdropping potentials by claiming
usages as "baby sitters" and "burglar alarms." Advertisements
read:

“World's Smallest Transmitter
Listen-in on any standard FM Radio
This miniature electronic marvel picks up the slightest

sound and clearly transmits them to any standard FM
radio up to 350 feet away..."

or

"Wall Hanging Thermometer FM Transmitter
which féatures a transmitter built into a wall thermo-
meter. Its sensitive microphone picks up all voices
and sounds in a room, transmitting by battery for more .
than one week." :
These advertised devices are aimed at relatively unsophis~

ticated individuals. Government agencies have no need for such

cy

wishes to purchase

electronic z ipme < car cit the business

of. any one of a dozen man

acturers which build and’.sell

surveillance equipment to government agencies. .

Many state and local police, however, are not authorized
to engage in electronic surveillance. The Wiretap Commission
discovered a number of police departments in states without
authorization statutes, that is, without specific laws allowing
for the use of court ordered wiretapping or bugging, who were
purchasing electronic. surveillance equipment which could be of

no lawful use to them.

The Commission's review of the sales of ten “Ranufacturers
of electronic seed ena equipment showed that the manufacturers

have ‘le ft the determination of whether

or official was authroized to purchase equipment largely up to
the department involved, with the result chat a number of sales

of questionable legality have been made.

The reason given. by some officials for their possession
of the equipment is not entirely satisfactory. In Dallas, for
example, where wiretapping without the consent of one party is

not permitted, the Chief of Police was quoted as stating that his

e bugging equipment "to make sure our good

is in working order

The results of the Wiretap Commission's study, which was
conducted by only two people, are certainly interesting. But
they are particularly revealing when contrasted with the results
ofa Department of Justice study which: was released two days ago.
That study noted that there were only 11 convictions last vane

in cases it prosecuted under the electronic surveillance statutes.

Privacy invasion, as typified by illegal eavesdropping,
has a chilling effect in our, society. Before speaking, many :
people weigh the costs of speaking freely against the risk of
the possible word-for-word @isclosure of their conversations to
unintended recipients, The comment, "I can't talk over the

telephone," has become the trademark of mistrustful individuals.

One step in restoring the confidence of Americans must be
an aggressive and affirmative approach to enforcing the criminal
statutes against illegal wiretapping. If any one factor has led
to the continuance of eavesdropping it is the failure of law
enforcement -~ Federal, State, and local -- to take the offensive
against this type of crime. The authorities must take the
initiative and prove to the public that they.are as interested in

protecting the people's privacy as they are their property-~

Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MARTIN L. KAISER “
‘. BEFORE THE
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
October 9, 1975

Mx. Chairman and Members.of the committee. My name is
Martin L. Kaiser and I am the president and sole: owner ia esrre
L. Kaiser, Inc., a Maryland corporation chartered in 1965, which
specializes in the development and manufacture of electronic
surveillance and counter-measure equipment. We presently market
over’ 300 products and have serviced and continue to service a
large variety of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.
Our list of clients includes but is not limited to the CIA, DIA,
Army Intelligence,.OSt, DEA, U.S. Postal Service, Secret Service,
ATF, IRS, Treasury, the FBI and numerous state and local law

enforcement agencies.

In 1975 I received the Baltimore County Distinguished
Citizen Award. I have been hired as a consultant by law enforce-—
ment agencies throughout the United States and was recently
commissioned by President Sadat, of Egypt to develop the electronic
surveillance and counter-measure capabilities for the Egyptian

Secret Service.

In 1968, the Omnibus Crime Bill was passed by Congress and

its passage had a great impact on the manufacture and sale of

. electronic surveillance equipment. Pursuant to this Act, the -

manufacture, assembly, possession, and sale of electronic
surveillance equipment was severely restricted. Advertising of

such equipment was absolutely forbidden. I noticed that there

ie Wher /32-

DocId:32989684 Page 109



were two types of manufacturers, those who lived up to the
dictates of the Omnibus Crime Act and those who flagrantly
violated its mandates. I called numerous and glaring violations
dealing. with illegal manufacture, sale, advertising and stockpiling
to the attention of the FBI. These types of violations were
clearly revealed by advertisements for electronic surveillance
equipment which were occasionally transparent and misleadingly
disguised as novelty items and which proliferated in both trade
and popular magazines. JI would like to call your attention to a
variety of these items, copies of which are included-in your
briefing books.
To the best of my knowledge none of the many violations
! Mie achion o%
which I reported to the FBI ever resulted in) iprosecutions. The
advertisements have not abated. In fact, they have proliferated
and the companies are flourishing. While I do not know why the
FBI refuses to enforce the regulations pertaining to electronic
surveillance equipment and enacted by Congress, I can offer this
theory. The FBI aisestigaters do not seem to possess sufficient
" Jechueal expertise in order to feel confident in bringing cases against
these violators. Therefore, as time goes by it becomes increas-
ingly more difficult for them to prosecute activities they have
allowed to flourish over a period of years. This problem becomes
more complex when we deal with technical advertisements. I call
your attention to page 103 of the Lafayette catalogue. ' Devices
described on this page can only be used in the furtherance of

wiretapping.

NW 55292 Docla:32989684 Page 111

During one of my visits tothe FBI, I noticed an entire

staff of people intently examining blown up schematic designs

‘of a pinball machine. They were apparently trying to put together

some sort of case regarding the interstate transportation of
pinball machines to Louisiana. If a similar effort was expended
to insure Bureau familiarization with the components of electronic
surveillance equipment, the illegal traffic in these materials

could be arrested.

I began my relationship with the FBI around 1967 or 1968.
All my correspondence was sent directly to the FBI. However, the
FBI would never correSpond with me. Instead, they sent agents

to my factory who selected equipment and made large orders. I

.was directed not to send equipment to the FBI, but instead to

sell it to the U.S. Recording Company, a private company located
at 1347 South Capitol Street, Washington, D. C. I informed the ,
Bureau that federal law would not allow me to sell to anyone
except bona fide governmental agencies. The FBI agents assured
me my actions were proper and subsequently supplied a stamp to
U.S. Recording which purported to certify on the purchase orders
that the transaction was in accordance with federal law. Subse~
quently, I discovered that U.S. Recording was charging the FBI

a 30% mark-up on the products that I supplied to them. During my
dealings with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I sold a total
of $100,090 worth of electronic surveillance equipment to the

FBI which was routed through U.S. Recording.



I was recently contacted by a distributorship in Massa-
chusetts which informed me that they had received a request for
my equipment to be routed through U.S.. Recording. I have provided
you with their brochure which shows that the specific item
ordered is marked up 100 percent by the company in Massachusetts
and will undoubtedly receive a further mark-up at the hand of

U.S. Recording on the way to its ultimate consumer.

I am in the constant process of improving and adding
innovations to my equipment. In order to insure the high
performance of my equipment, I will modify any equipment I have
sold with my latest innovations absolutely free of charge. In
1975, I contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order
to have them return equipment purchased from me so that I could
modernize and upgrade the quality of these electronic devices.
The FBI initially denied that they had any of my equipment. I

“ consider this action not only frustrating, but a foolish: exercise
of secrecy for its own sake. Eventually, the FBI did admit

possession of my equipment.

In the course of my dealings with the other governmental
agencies to which I have previously alluded, I found myself in
another complex business arrangement. Whenever I would orally
contract to furnish a governmental agency with electronic
surveillance equipment, the written order for such equipinent ae
would always be routed through Ft. Holabird as a U.S. Army order,
There was no indication on the order as to the real purchaser
of the equipment.

ke 55292 DocId:32989684 Page 112



As an aside, while at Ft. Holabird, I noticed that my
_, equipment was being inserted into a number of imaginative objects,
including but not limited to mattresses, golf clubs and electric

toothbrushes.

In summation, it is clear to mé as an expert in the field
of @lectronic surveillance equipment, that the FBI demonstrates
virtually no interest in enforcing federal laws dealing with
electronic surveillance equipment. This is discouraging to me,

both morally and financially.

If the Committee is interested, I would be pleased to
demonstrate examples of equipment which I have sdld to the

intelligence community.

Thank you.

Dear Mr. Chairman:
L
‘This is in response to your letter of October 8, 1975, soliciting
my views and those of my associates concerning the future role of the intel~
ligence community. As I indicated to you in my initial response to your
letter, dated October 17, 1975, I appreciate the opportunity to offer my
ebservations as to the future of United States intelligence agencies and
activities insofar as the FBI is concerned. Gf course, congressional
assessment of the activities and effectiveness of the FRI and other
membors of the intelligence eommunity ia not yet complete, and I
feel that it would be inappropriate for me to make specific recommen-
dations for consideration by your Committes at this time. However, T
would like to offer some general observations which relate to the fulfili-
ment of the Nation's security requirements.

T would hope that, out of the curront Legisletive and
Executive Branch examination of the intelligence agencies and their
proper role, a consensus could be achieved concerning Presidential
powers in the national security ficld. :

i. To onsure the future effectiveness of our national security
programs, I helieve that the Congress should clearly define the broad
objectives which it expeets should be achieved by the various apencies,

Foner whieh function as components of the United States intellirence community.
Dep. - As the FBI Director, I accept full responsibility for teking appropriate
wr ae — action te eehieve such goals through the establishment end supervision

Honorable Otis G. Pike

We must have improved communications betwcen the security/
intelligenee agencies of the Executive Branch and the Congress, so that the
American public might be assured that the Nation's law enforcement end
national security interests are being protected in a manner consistent with
the policies declared by their elected representatives. We should strive to
establish some form of meaningful oversight of FBI activities so that we may
avoid duplication of testimony and the proliferation of requests for hichly
sensitive information beyond that which is absolutely ossential. Establish-
ment of a joint Senate-House oversight committee would be an appropriate
mechanism to achieve this objective.

It is my hope that any future determinations by the Congress to
enact statutory safeguards to protect the integrity of the law enforcement
function will not impose undue restrictions on necessary investigations
concerning critical national security matters. We in the FBI desire a
balanced picture to emerge concerning FBI investigations, which, in
addition to calling attention to any weakness in its performance, also
recognizes its accomplishments, and preserves for the FBI the investi-
gative flexibility necessary to fulfill responsibilities of ever-increasing
complexity. This flexibility is essential if we are to function effectively
as a deterrent to Increasing threats to our liberties, both from criminal
elements and the organized, sophisticated elendestine operations of our
potential adversaries in the international environment. In the domestic
security and foreign counterintelligence areas, the maintenance of the
stability of our system of Government and the prevention of violence and
disorder are the FBI's primary objectives.

My staff and I would be happy to meet with you at any time
to discuss the future role of the FBI in the intelligence community and the
steps which we might now take to ensure the civil liberties of our people
and the protection of our national security.

Sincerely yours,

Clarence M, Kelley
Director

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

Briefing was initiated by Special Agent McNiff
discussing the ground rules under which the briefing would
be given, emphasizing the sensitivity of such information -
and suggested the’ format to be followed, all of which were
agreed to by those in attendance.

Section Chief Branigan then followed with a briefing,
in general terms, of the two proprietaries operated by the
Bureau in the field of national security, and Section Chief
McCarthy similarly followed with a briefing of three
proprietaries operated by ‘the Bureau in the field of organized
erime. Upon conclusion of the briefing relating to each
operation, HSC Staff Member Hughes asked a number of questions

- concerning each which were answered to his satisfaction by
Messrs. Branigan and McCarthy. At no time were any of these
eerie? identified by name nor were the names of involved
individuals mentioned. Mr. Hughes was advised that material
relating to the proprietaries in the national security field
is classified "Top Secret."

From the nature of the questions asked by Mr. Hughes,

{it appears the primary interest of the HSC in this area is

the financial aspects relating to each operation. Specific

questions dealt with the initial and operating costs, source

of funds, arrangements for handling of possible. profits,

compliance with Federal and local tax regulations, as well

as compliance with ordinances relating to incorporating,

licensing, etc,

At the conclusion of briefing,Mr. Hughes stated
Ihe was impressed by the Bureau operations in these areas,
that information furnished him on this occasion would be
given to appropriate HSC personnel on a strict need-to-~know

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

other HSC Staff Members present a brief resume of the
background and history of this Bureau's involvement in the
field of electronic coverage, including authorization for
use of same, procedures utilized for obtaining warrantless
telephone and microphone surveillances, extent to which this
Bureau has used this technique in the years 1970-1975 and,
in general terms, the type and value of information received
from this technique.

During the above briefing, Representative McClory
interjected several questions concerning the applicability
of Title III as provided by the Safe Streets Act of 1968,
which questions were answered by Mr, Wannall. Inspector Hotis
advised Representative McClory that he, Hotis, interpreted
the 1968 Act as an invitation to Congress to draft legis-
lation regarding electronic surveillance which would be
applicable to security-type investigations.

In response to specific questions, Mr. Wannall
also advised HSC representatives that this Bureau has not
engaged in warrantless electronic surveillance of domestic
targets since the Keith Decision in 1972, that at the time
of the Keith Decision this Bureau had 10 or less domestic
targets under electronic surveillance; that all such physical
installations were made strictly by Bureau personnel; that
on oceasion arrangements are perfected with telephone
companies for the use of leased lines and that on occasion
such installations are made at the request of other Government
agencies and with the approval of the Attorney General.

Representative McClory then inquired as to the
number of electronic surveillances maintained by the Bureau
on domestic targets during the years 1970 to 1972, and
Mr. Oliphant inquired as to whether or not the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) was one such target during that period.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

Mr. Wannall answered that the Intelligence Division is presently
in the process of preparing material identifying all electronic
surveillances conducted by this Bureau during the years 1970

to 1975, as well as obtaining excised supporting documents
containing the authorization for each operation, This material
lis being furnished the HSC on a continuing basis and it is
lanticipated the entire project will be completed in the very
near future, Answers to the above questions, although not
immediately available at the time of the briefing, will be’
found in the above material being prepared by this Bureau.

Representative McClory inquired as to whether such
material would include information relating to the Halperin
(one of the Kissinger 17} case. Department Attorney Blackhurst
responded that the Halperin material is covered by a restrictive
court order but he would attempt to see if the court order
applied to the HSC, and, if so, he would attempt to Soa the
court order modified.

Representative McClory also stressed the importance
of prompt replies being made to HSC inquiries explaining that
the HSC Chairman considers a delay in replying as being
synonymous with a lack of cooperation. Mr. Wannall advised
that all HSC inquiries are being handled as expeditiously as
possible and he pointed out that, during the month of
September, 61.4 Agent supervisors out of a total of 130 assigned
to the Intelligence Division were occupied in non-substantive
work matters such as preparing responses to the HSC inquiries.

Inquiries from the HSC representatives then turned,
in general terms, to areas covering the now defunct Attorney
General subversive list, criteria and purpose of the Security
Index and its successor, the ADEX, and Soviet ‘espionage in ©
this country.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

At the conclusion of the briefing, Representative
McClory expressed to Mr, Wannall his thanks and the thanks
of other HSC Staff Members present for the information
provided during the briefing and added that he hopes the
current spirit of cooperation between the HSC and the FBI
will continue and that the purpose of the HSC in formulating
meaningful legislation of benefit to the intelligence
community will be accomplished.

OBSERVATIONS :

Information requested by the HSC concerning electronic
surveillance conducted by this Bureau is being handled as a

‘special project by the Intelligence Division, It is estimated

that the complete response in this sensitive area will
encompass excisions to some 1,650 documents, To date, 165
excised items have been furnished the HSC. Remaining excisions
will. be furnished the HSC on a continuing basis and it is
expected the project will be completed by 10/17/75, The next
communication prepared by this Bureau forwarding the above
material to the HSC will contain a specific reply to HSC
inquiries concerning the number of domestic targets under
electronic surveillance during the years 1970 to 1972 and
whether or not the SWP was such a target. Contact will be
maintained with Mr. Blackhurst of the Department to ascertain
whether or not pertinent material related to the Halperin case
should be furnished the HSC.

“Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

other HSC Staff Members present a brief resume of the
background and history of this Bureau's involvarent in the
field of electronic coverage, including authorization for
use of same, procedures utilized for obtaining warrantless
telephone and microphone surveillances, extent to which this
Bureau has used this technique in the years 1970-1975 and,
in general terms, the type and value of information received
from this technique.

During the above briefing, Representative McClory
interjected several questions concerning the applicability
of Title III as provided by the Safe Streets Act of 1968,
which questions were answered by Mr. Wannall. Inspector Hotis
advised Representative McClory that he, Hotis, interpreted
the 1968 Act as an invitation to Congress to craft legis-
lation regarding electronic surveillance which would be
applicable to security-type investigations.

In response to specific questions, Mr. Wannall
also advised HSC representatives thet this Bureau has not
engaged in warrantless electromic surveillance of domestic
targets since the Keith Decision in 1972, that at the time
of the Keith Decision this Bureau had 10 or less domestic |
targets under electronic surveillance; that al. such physical
instellations were made strictly by Bureau personnel; chat
on occasion arrangements are perfected with telephone
companies for the use of leased lines and .that on occasion
such installations are made at the request of other Government
agencies and with the approval of the Attorney General.

Representative McClory then inquired as to the
number of electronic surveillances maintained hy the Bureau
on domestic targets during the years 1970 to 1972, anc
Mr. Oliphant inquired as to whether or not the Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) was one such target during that period.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

Mr. Wannail answered that the Intelligence Division is presently
in the process of preparing material identifying all electronic
surveillances conducted by this Bureau during the years 1970

to 1975, as well as obtaining excised supporting documents
containing the authorization for each operation. This material
is being furnished the HSC on a continuing basis and it is
anticipated the entire project will be completed in the very
near future. Answers to the above questions, although not
immediately available at the time of the briefing, will be
found in the above material being prepared by this Bureau.

Representative McClory inquired as to whether such
material would include information relating to the Halperin
{one of the Kissinger 17) case. Department Attorney Blackhurst
‘responded that the Halperin material is covered by a restrictive
court order but he would attempt to see if the court order
applied to the HSC, and, if so, he would attempt to have the
court order modified.

Representative McClory also stressed the importance
of prompt replies being made to HSC inquiries explaining that
the HSC Chairman considers a delay in replying as being
synonymous with a lack of cooperation. Mr. Wannall advised
that all HSC inquiries are being handled as expeditiously as
possible and he pointed out that, during the month of
September, 61.4 Agent supervisors out of a total of 150 assigned
to the Intelligence Division were occupied in non~substantive
work matters such as preparing responses to the HSC. inquiries.

Inquiries from the HSC representatives then turned,
in general terms, to areas covering the now defunct Attorney
General subversive list, criteria and purpose of the Security
Index and its successor, the ADEX, and Soviet espionage in
this country.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R,. Wannall
Re: Houstudy 75
62-116464

At the conclusion of the briefing, Representative
McClory expressed to Mr. Wannall his thanks and the thanks
of other HSC Staff Members present for the information
_ provided during the briefing and added that he hopes the
current spirit of cooperation between the HSC and the FBI
will continue and that the purpose of the HSC ia formulating
. Meaningful legislation of benefit to the intelligence
community will be accomplished.

OBSERVATIONS :

Information requested by the HSC concerning electronic
surveillance conducted by this Bureau is being handled as a
special project by the Intelligence Division. It is estimated
that the complete response in this sensitive area will
encompass excisions to some 1,650 documents. To date, 165
excised items have been furnished the HSC. Remaining excisions
will be furnished the HSC on a continuing basis and it is
expected the project will be completed by 10/17/75. The next
communication prepared by this Bureau forwarding the above
material to the HSC will contain a specific reply to HSC
inquiries concerning the number of domestic targets under
electronic surveillance during the years 1970 to 1972 and
whether or not the SWP was such a target. Contact will be
maintained with Mr, Blackhurst of the Department to ascertaia
whether or not pertinent material related to the Halperin case
should be furnished the HSC.

RECOMMENDATION :

None. Above submitted for information.

UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE (HSC)

Reference is made to HSC request dated August 27, 1975,
for "delivery of all ADEX lists that have been maintained since
January 1, 1973 until the present." It is also noted on the
occasion of the testimony of Assistant Director E. W. Walsh of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) before the HSC on
August 7, 1975, on the subject matter "Budget Inquiry on
Intelligence Activities," pages 1278-1279 of the testimony
transcript indicates that Representative Ronald V. Dellums
inquired "What is the SI?; What was the authority for it?;

Is it still in operation?; If not, when did it end?; Was
operation ever discussed with Congress or OMB; Did Bureau
budget show funds for operation of SI?"

As the subject matter of both the Administrative Index
(ADEX) and the Security Index (SI) programs are interrelated,
there is set forth below background information concerning these
programs which is believed will be responsive to inquiries of
the HSC. 7

During 1939 and 1940, a custodial detention
list was compiled by the FBI consisting of the identity of
those individuals whose presence at liberty in the United
States in time of war or national emergency would be dangerous
to the public peace and safety of the United States Government.
On June 26, 1940, the Attorney General was advised of such a
list and on March 18, 1941, information pertaining to the
identity and tendencies of individuals on this list was forwarded
to the Department of Justice. The use of the term custodial
detention list was discontinued on August 14, 1943, and the

list then became known as the SI. During 1945 the SI was
cancelled except for those portions relating to communists,
Russians, and individuals whose nationalistic tendencies
resulted from an ideological or organizational affiliation

with Marxist groups. On March 8, 1946, the FBI advised

the Attorney General a list was being prepared of all members
of the Communist Party and any others who would be dangerous

or potentially dangerous in the event of a break in diplomatic
relations with the Soviet Union, or other serious crisis,
involving the United States and the USSR. This list was

to be prepared as a result of developments in the international
situation during that time period and in light of Soviet
espionage investigations then being conducted by the FBI. The
Attorney General was apprised of this list so the Attorney
General could advise whether such action met with his approval.
As far back as September 20, 1946, the Department of Justice
advised the FBI that a program was under consideration for the
detention of communists in the event of a national emergency
or hostilities between the United States and the USSR through
Presidential Directive which vould empower the Secretary of War
to define a military exclusion area and would provide for the
detention of persons by the Bureau of Prisons. During August,
1948, the Department provided the FBI with a Departmental
Portfolio entitled, "Program For Apprehension and Detention of
Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National Defense
and Public Safety of the United States." This program estab-
lished guidelines for the apprehension by the FBI of individuals
considered dangerous to the national defense of the United States
during times of emergency. In time of an emergency a
Presidential Proclamation would be issued and brought before
Congress for ratification.

On September 23, 1950, the Internal Security Act of
1950 became a law and with it the passage of Title II concerning
the Emergency Detention Act (EDA). Title II of the Internal
Security Act declared that when a state of internal security
emergency is proclaimed by the President, he, through the
Attorney General, would direct the apprehension and detention
of each person as to whom there were reasonable grounds to
believe that such person probably would engage in, or probably
conspire with others to engage in acts of espionage or sabotage.
The list, or SI, being maintained by the FBI of those persons
who should be considered dangerous during times of an emergency
was to be utilized to aid in the apprehension and detention
of individuals under the auspices of the EDA. During 1951, a

because they exercise their constitutional rights of protest
or dissent. Membership in a subversive organization is not
sufficient to warrant inclusion on this index. Individuals
who are included are those who have exhibited a willingness

or capability of engaging in treason, rebellion, sedition,
sabotage, espionage, assassination of Government officials,
terrorism, guerrilla warfare, or other acts which would result
in interference with or a threat to the survival and effective
operation of national, state, or local government. During 1972
the operation of this index was evaluated and revised to include
only those individuals who pose a realistic, direct and current
danger to the national security.

The ADEX is printed on 5 x 8 cards which are main-
tained at FBIHQ in the Intelligence Division. Name, back-
ground information, file numbers, and type of activity in
which the individual is engaged are placed on the cards. This
index is reviewed continuously and on a monthly basis is brought
up to-date with names being added and deleted. Once deletions
are made, former lists cannot be reconstructed. The index
on January 15, 1975, contained the names of 1,537 individuals
and as of August. 15, 1975, there were 1,294 names on the index.

As an administrative aid the index currently utilized
by the FBI enables the FBI to remain alert to individuals who
have exhibited a propensity to conduct acts inimical to the
national security and affords the FBI a record of individuals
who would merit close investigative attention pending legal
steps by the President to take further action. It also
serves as an extremely valuable list of individuals who pose
a threat to the safety of the President of the United States,
thereby enabling the FBI to provide current data to the
United States Secret Service concerning these individuals.

As noted above, the past lists cannot be reconstructed
and the index contains only the names and background information
which would identify individuals listed thereon. For reasons
of privacy and inasmuch as release of information on this
index could adversely affect current operations and
investigations being conducted by the FBI, information con-
tained on the index is not being furnished.

From a review of pertinent FBI files and from
contact with knowledgeable FBI personnel, it does not
appear the operation of the SI was discussed with
Congress or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
nor has the budget of the FBI indicated a specific
breakdown of funds for operation of the SI.

NOTE:

LHM is being classified "Secret" inasmuch as information
contained therein discusses aspects of the Emergency Detention
Program, which program was classified by the Department.

Questions pertaining to the budget and whether
the SI had been mentioned to Congress or OMB were discussed
with Section Chief L. Clyde Groover of the Administrative
Division. Mr. Groover indicated he was unaware of any
previous testimony before Congress or information being
provided OMB regarding the SI. He further indicated the
Bureau budget did not specifically break down costs for
operation of the SI.

voluntarily appeared in my office and advised me that he had been inter -
viewed by a representative of the House Select Committee on September 26,
1975. The purpose of the interview was to develop information concerning
confidential business transactions between the FBimd Mr. Tait’s company,
the U.S. Recording Company. Mr. Tait advised that his understanding é
that his relationship with the FBI was confidential and he so advised the ,<"""
Committee representative who responded that it may become necessary
for the Committee to issue a subpoena for Mr. Tait’s testimony and
for his records. Mr. Tait requested advice as to what action he should
take in response to demands by the Committee for information concerning
matters regarded as confidential.

Itold Mr Tait that the information he furnished me would be
made available to the Department for consideration of action that might be taken
by the Attorney General concerning what appears to be interference with
FBL confidential sources. wesentatives of the we’ Committee,

I called Mr. Cochran in the Laboratory and reauested him

such records would be properly protected by classification and to assess
the damage that might be incurred if the records are produced to the
Committee. I also spoke to Michael Shaheen in the Deputy Attorney General's
office, explained to him in general terms the problem of Committee interviews

not to try to be evasive. The information he wanted he knew Mr. Tait
could supply and if you will not cooperate with us and give us the
information, we will subpoena the records of your company.

Mr. Tait advised Mr. Vermeire that he could not give

had classified the information, Mr. Tait advised that the Bureau had
classified his records.

Mr. Tait cited an incident that happened probably in
1969 or 1970 which concerned John Matter and a contract with
the Martin Kaiser Company. Mr. Vermeire asked why this deal,
which concerned the purchase of some equipment, was not worked
out through Mr. Tait. Mr. Tait's response was that he thought this
information should be something received from the Bureau and that
he did not wish to discuss the matter.

Mr. Vermeire noted that there had not been as many
contracts with his company since the death of Mr. Hoover and he
wanted to know if he had received all the contracts because ha had
been a close personal friend of Mr. Hoover.

In response to my question regarding his purpose in
coming to the Bureau to furnish this information, Mr. Tait advised
that he had come to the Bureau voluntarily to furnish the information
concerning the interview and to receive some guidance as to what
he should do if he was recontacted by the House Select Committee.

Mr. Tait advised that he stamped the following statement
on all his contract forms:

"This order complies with the provisions of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of
1968."

Mr. Vermeire mentioned that Mr. Tait had no right to use
this stamp. That the above statement could only be used by a law enforcement
agency, or a law enforcement agent employed by a law enforcement agency.

I called Mr. Cochran in the Laboratory and‘asked him to
determine whether or not the records of confidential purchases were protected
by the classification Confidential under the executive order including records
maintained by the dealers and alsoI called Mike Shaheen in the
Deputy Attorney General's office and told him that we had a problem
concerning a confidential source of the Bureau who had been approached
by representatives of the House Committee for interview concerning his
confidential relationship with the Bureau. I told him of the possibility
that the records could be protected by classification, but I asked him if the
Department would be willing to address the matter with the Chairman of the

House Committee on the basis that the Committee staff is interfering
with our confidential sources by interviewing them personally.

Shaheen said that we have such an agreement with the Senate, but

no agreement with the House Committee, but that he felt that this matter
» should be presented to the Attorney General formally and that te
Attorney General would probably address the matter to the Chairman

of the Committee.

Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination in the Department, telephonically advised SA
Paul V. Daly of this Division that he had received an oral request from
Richard Vermeire of the House Select Committee that Unit Chief James C.
Kraus be made available for public testimony before the House Select
Committee, Thursday, 10/9/75, the exact time was not specified. Vermeire
stated the topic of the hearings would be the Bureau's investigation of
Interception of Communications violations.

Director Sec'y

It was pointed out to Blackhurst that Kraus was a Unit Chief
in the General Investigative Division and the Bureau traditionally, as have
other Government agencies, used personnel in a policy-making position for 7 eS
purposes of testimony before Congressional Committees. It was explained , a
to Blackhurst where in the Bureau's organization a Unit Chief would rank,y” ot
and Blackhurst indicated he was not aware of what the rank Unit Chief conveyed

It was also pointed out that this was the same issue that had been
presented in the dispute between the State Department and this Committee
concerning who would be appropriate to testify concerning particular matters
and to our knowledge this dispute had not been resolved. Blackhurst indicated
he would communicate to the White House the request of the House Committee
and point out the fact the fact the Committee was calling witnesses to testify
on investigative policy who were not in a policy-making position. He also
stated he would convey this same problem to the Attorney General through
Special Assistant to the Attorney General, Doug Marvin. Blackhurst agreed
that the procedure concerning the designation by the Committee of witnesses
is not acceptable and that he would recommend that the Department andsthe
White House resist as much as possible this request: b 2 ITE Pls of fe VIB

RE; HOUSTUDY

In view of the possibility that our protests may not be
successful and Unit Chief Kraus may ultimately have to testify, it is
believed advantageous to waive the employment agreement of SA Kraus
and the Code of Federal Regulations provisions for purposes of testimony
at this time.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1) That the employment agreement and Code of Federal
Regulations provisions be waived for purposes of testimony by SA Kraus

concerning the Bureau's investigation of Interception of Communications
matters.

Subsequently, Blackhurst advised he had talked to a White
House representative concerning the aforementioned matter and the White
House indicated it was up to the Department of Justice to set policy in this
regard. They stated they had similarly referred the matter in dispuebetween
the State Department and the Committee to State Department to resolve.

_ Blackhurst requested a letter be written immediately to the Attorney General

setting forth the Bureau's observations concerning this request. A letter
is separately being sent to the Attorney General.

By memorandum dated 10/7/75, you were advised that we
have been requested by the House Select Committee to make avail-
able Unit Chief James C. Kraus for testimony concerning Inter-
ception of CommuniGations violations before that Committee on
10/9/75. We also advised that we were preparing a letter to the
Attorney General expressing this Bureau's position that it was
not appropriate or desirable for a Unit Chief to testify con-
cerning the Bureau's investigative matters and we would rather
designate another appropriate Bureau official for purposes of
this testimony. The letter was prepared and delivered to the
Department on 10/7/75.

: At his request, Assistant Director John A. Mintz and
Executive Assistant to the Deputy Associate Director Paul Mack

and John Pringle of the General Investigative Division met with 7
Deputy Attorney General Harold Tyler. Also present from the vi
Department at. the meeting were Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special or
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, and his Assistant, Stevgi
Blackhurst. The Deputy expressed concern that if the Bureau Of "
Department were to resist the request of the House Select Com- ee
mittee, as was requested in our letter of 10/7/75, that the
Committee might escalate this resistence into a matter re-

quiring litigation. He pointed out that the State Department

in their refusal to make certain employees available before

that Committee appears to be entered into a situation which

will lead to litigation. As a counterproposal, Assistant

Director Mintz suggested that it would be appropriate for the
Bureau to attempt through contact with Staff Members of the

House Select Committee to arrange for a substitute witness

and in the alternative arrange to have another Bureau.’ official

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: HOUSTUDY

Pursuant to the aforementioned suggestion, SA Paul V.
Daly of this Division discussed this matter with Richard Vermeire
of captioned Committee. Vermeire indicated that he could not make
a decision in this matter and referred SA Daly to A. Searle Field,
Staff Director for the House Select Committee. Field, after con-
ferring with Chairman Otis Pike, advised SA Daly that it was not
acceptable for the Bureau to substitute a witness for purposes
of the testimony. He stated, however, the Committee had no
objection to the Bureau sending along another Bureau official
with Unit Chief Kraus. Field stated the hearing will be held
at 10 a.m., 10/9/75, in Room 2118, Rayburn Building, and that
Kraus would be a "peripheral witness." By this Field explained
that the main witnesses would be Michael J. Hershman, Chief
Investigator of the National Wiretap Commission, former U.S.
Attorney in Houston, Texas, Anthony J. P. Farris, a manu-
facturer of electronic surveillance devices and an individual
who had done wiretapping. He indicated that Kraus would be
asked very few questions and that the possibility existed that
he might not be asked any questions and this is what he meant
by "peripheral witness." It was explained to Field that there
might be some questions which Kraus could not respond to be-
cause they involved ongoing Bureau investigations or other
policy considerations and Field concurred Kraus should merely
so state if such a question is asked.

The aforementioned decision of the House Select
Committee was explained to Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination Shaheen and he was askéd if the Department was
willing to have someone accompany Kraus to this particular
hearing. He stated no. It was pointed out that there is a
possibility we might get questions concerning current in-
vestigations or other areas in which the Bureau cannot
respond. Shaheen indicated that if there is a question
such as the Houston Wiretapping matter which is being re-
viewed by the Department, this Bureau should refuse to
réspond stating that this matter is currently under review
by the Department and likewise if the question should per~
tain to an ongoing investigation, refuse to respond on that
basis.

The Congressional Record of 9/17/75 contained comments
made by Chairman of captioned Committee, Otis Pike, stating that
a notebook bearing a classification stamp had been left unattended
in a Congressional office. His comments indicated that Roderick
Hills, Assistant Counsel to the President, was the individual
responsible for leaving the notebook. Pike indicated he would
assist the FBI in investigating the matter. News accounts quoted
Hills as stating the notebook did not contain classified material.

In view of Chairman Pike's apparent expectation that the
FBI would conduct an investigation concérning the aforementioned
matter, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division at the request of Ex- , 93

RE: HOUSTUDY '75

The briefings went rather smoothly and the
only area of extensive questioning by the Staff Members
was the area of extremist activity in the AIM. The
Staff Members requested to be advised concerning allega-
tions of harassment by SAs of the FBI in connection
with investigations on the Pine Ridge Reservation prior
to the killing of two SAs. The Staff Members were
advised that allegations of harassment were received
by the FBI and were looked into and it was determined
that they were unfounded and, further, that the Agents
on Pine Ridge Reservation, including the Agents who were
killed, were performing their official duties in con-
ducting investigations concerning criminal activities
and persons connected with fugitive matters. When asked
for specific details concerning these allegations of
harassment and the Bureau's answer on each one, the Staff
Members were advised that they should make a request in
writing. They advised that they would do this.

In addition to the above, they asked specific
questions concerning informants, including how many
informants were presently in the Republic of New Africa.-
The Staff Members were advised that informants were not
a matter to be discussed in this briefing and that if they
desired additional information concerning informants,
they should also make a request in writing.

ACTION:

On August 7, 1975, Assistant FBI Director Eugene 1.
Valsh appeared before a hearing of the NSC dealing with the
subject matter “Budget Inquiry on Intelligence Activities."
During the course of the hearing, members of the Committee made
specific inguiries into the operations of this Bureau, which

provides leased lines for use in technical surveillances all of

As the hearing proeceded, it became readily apparent tat the
objective of the hearing was to provide a f for allegations made by
former United States Attorney Anthony J. P>\farris; Michael J;\Hershman,
former General Investigator for the National Commission for the‘Review of
Federal and State Laws Rolating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance;
Anthony V;, Zavala, former officer of the Narcotics Division of the Houston
Police Depitment and Martin L; Kaiser, the sole owner of a corporation
which specializes in the developmeht.and manufacture of electronic surveillance
and counter-measure equipment. The point of thelr combined testimony
was that the FBI was unwilling, as a matter of policy, to undertake appropriate
investigation of violations of the wirctapping statutes. In addition, the
Committee addressed inquiries to Mr. Kraus concerning administrative
matters and FBI policy which, because of his position, he was not prepared
to discuss,

Though Mr, Kraus offered an explanation to the Committee that he had
been interviewed by Committee staff members and had advised the staff
of the limits of his authority and knowledge concerning FEI activities,
the Committee still had insisted upon his appearance as the F BI representative.
Mr. Kraus suggested that other Bureau officials would be more
appropriate witnesses to respond to the Committee's inquiries, however,
the Committee declined to accept the offer of the availability of another
Bureau official. It should be noted that two Assistant Directors were
present with Mr. Kraus and available to respond to any inquiries the
Committee might have addressed to them.

The result of the arrangement enforced by the Committee's
insistence upon Mr. Kraus appearing as the witness was that the Committee
received public testimony containing numerous allegations concerning the
FH, United States Attorneys, and the Department, but did not afford an

opportunity for approyriate response, This imbalance was unfair to the witness
and to the Fit. ‘Therefore, sa we indicated in our oreyious memorandum, we
{cel it is inappropriate for the House Select Committee to dictate the level

of representation of the PEI before the Committee in public seasion.

udexstanding with Chairman Fike that would permit the Committe’
legitimate inquiries to be answered by those officials in a position to
furnish complete and accurate statements of policy concerning broad
administrative and operational maters. Further, we request that in
fature appeerances before the House Select Committees you designate an
appropriate Department official to attend and to Se prenared to respond

what the Department's position would be if the Committee wanted

that should they xeceive a request concerning Bureau informant

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

‘

Attached concerns the Interception of
Communications fcase which our Houston Office
has under investigation regarding alleged
wiretapping activities by the Houston Police
Department. |

The UPI news release states that former
United States Attorney Farris said the FBI and
the Drug Enforcement Administration knew about
the illegal wiretaps and did nothing despite
repeated requests for an investigation by his
office. The article also says he wrote to the
then Attorney General Saxbe and other officials
and talked personally once last year with FBI
Director Clarence Kelley. GID is not aware af
any personal contact with the Director.

It is noted this statement is either a
misquote or is in direct conflict with prior
testimony by Farris before the Subcommittee on
CGeurts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration
of Justice of the Committee on the Judiciary
on 5/27/75, wherein Farris waB asked by Congress-

man Drinan why he didn't O Clarence Kelley.
He replied that he h ho the people in the
Criminal Division a General Crimes Section
would do that as ad done in other cases.
