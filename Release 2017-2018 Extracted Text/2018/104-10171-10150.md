FROM: = Deputy Director, : ae

suns: “Tnternationsl Rescue Comittee trons formerly International
7 Rescuc aml Relief Cumittee {]7uc).

1. Reference fa made to the request of Mr. Abajian on 15 December 1954
for information concerning the above naned organization and individuals asov-

* elated with the organiration,

2. Dr, Bola GAMTAY, @ former major in the Royal Hungarian Police, sub-
itted a decusent to the Departsent of State charging the TRC and various
renbers of the argentzation vith futhertiy the Interests of Conmuniss unier
tha gulae of an anti-Communist relic? orgnnication, The files of this office
contaia no derogatory information on Bela CANTAY. Hio true name ie appare
ently Dr. Adaibert GANTAY, born 2O March 1910 in Budapest, ikmgary. A res
port of 22 Fovesber 149 indicated that Subject hod proviously been active.
for a Weatern Intelligence group in activities directed against the Soviet

‘Union.

3. According to a repart of 30 Mareh 1953, the International Rescue
and Relief Comittee (IRC) with offices at 103 Park Avene, Hew York City
acd 35 Boulevard des Cameines, Paris, is an outgrowth of the former Inter
national Kelief Cumuittes ond the Scergemy Relief Comittee. It was farmed
originally to assist refugees from Mari Germany. Sinue 1945 it hao furctioned
5 an anti-Fuseist organization ansisting refugces without regant to nation~
ality. It was stated in ths report that the IRIC, though’ not ostensibly a
Cosmamist organization, hed several Caanmmists affiliated with it.

4. A relisble source reported on 15 March 1950 that one-third. af the
budset of the International Rescue Comittee for 1943 ami 19:9 was expended
in France in connscyion vith Spaniar’s in exile, who were considerably
penetrated by Cammmist influence. David MARTIN, described by Source as the
prine‘pal force withing the IXC, vas referred to os an ex-Trotckyite of ean-

siderable ability and enevay.

5. Tt was stated in a report dated 20 March 1949 from a reliable source
that cine Vorid War Ti, the IRC hea ecee under suspicion es a possible



eésoe ot

Commmist organization or clever front organization used by Comunists for
intelligence purposes. It was noted that in the United States ami Burope
the JRC maintained cloce contact vith anti-Govict exigre groups.

6. In mammry, verious allegations havo. been made against mubers of ‘
‘the IRC te the effect that they ore Marxists, Cammmists or at least Sociale
iets. Hone of these proffered. opinions can be substantiated; yet, it is
Plauible that the organization has been penetrated by Commmist agents. The i
Gegree of control, if any, cxercised by them cannot be determined from a ree
view of tha available material, nor can it be determined with certainty who Hl
in the organization are ectually Courmmists. Attached hereto is available
intrsation concerning the folloving individuals mamtioned in GAFIAY's reporty _
