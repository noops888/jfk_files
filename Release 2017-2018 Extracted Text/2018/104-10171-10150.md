speare Report on Satellite nationals in the North German Area.

In 1945 the total number of refugees in west Gormany amounted

to 10 millions

of people.

By 1953 this number had been reduced to

approximately 240,000, whore it has resined relatively otatio ever

Of this latter number, approximately 12,373 (or ca. 5% 0f

the total) mere located in the Hamburg area. As a sroup, they

youthful and prolific. Approximately 128 are social cau.s, 50% are

active and employable adults, 8% are esployed by the occupation

authorities and over 25% are unemployad.

The overall percentage of non-German refugees among the native

population is .48%.

In Hanburg this fizure 18 .73% unfle Schloswig

It is interesting to compare

the figure 2204 with the total for Hamburg

refugee camps in

Table A, 2189,

and also with the figure in

Table B,

2018 (17 February 1955) to show how statio these figures are. (Table As

June 1952).

Also of intorest is ta fact that the ratio of these in

pamps to those outside is generally 5:3 (Table A), while zor Hamburg,

the ratio is closer to 115.

7. To show why the German authorities tend to pay less attention

to the nor German refugees,

the figures for Geran refigees for land

Niedersachsen as of 1 Aurust 1953 are included in Table D. (See also

figures in 5 above..

. If one includes those Geraans receiving

then the figure is 142,186 in 1623 camps
