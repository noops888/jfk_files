Subj : Request for Information under FOIA on OSWALD

We have attached a copy of the printout on OSWs D from the ©.
U.S. Defector Machine Program, a sub-program of the Soviet GICS -
Machine Program. (The 26 page computer print-out to which Mr. ba
Lané makes reference is probably the file content listing. Itis © :
remarkable that FOIA requests now and then indicate leaks of
information, )- Under the terms published in the Federal Register,
we are not-obligated to provide (a) material from newspapers, books, =
and other overt sources; nor (b) information provided by other USG
agencies; nor. (c) information provided by foreign services. Data.
from those three sources have been marked in yellow, leaving only
some 16 lines. ' (The sources are SB Division's SPR filed in 201-305052
and HMMA-31932.. I assume that both of these sources involve foreign
liaison, and hence are exempt. ) In any case, there is nothing in the
machine summary which is not covered by the 201. If you want to send
the machine dossier along to DDO/FOIO, Ihave no objection, but nothing
from this machine dossier should be passed to the requester.
