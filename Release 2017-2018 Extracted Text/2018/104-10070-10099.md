HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE BRAVO GROUP IN LATE 60S.

MIAMI'S RECORDS OF SABOTAGE OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA

MAY BE ABLE TO ISOLATE TWO OR THREE PERSONS WHO

FIT THIS GENERAL CRITERIA FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

D. CHISAGE- 1 ALLEGES THAI QUESADA WAS IN NEW

ELIMINATE ROGELIO RODRIGUEZ (DEPENDING UPON HIS

PRESENT WHEREABOUTS) AS A PRIME CANDIDATE.
