mentioned directly or indirectly in the draft report. The draft, on

its first page, alleges "Cointelpro is the story of decent mén who did
terrible things for what they saw as the greater good of the country"
and later editorializes ‘the only conclusion that can be drawn from
the cases is that the Bureau considered the First Amendment a danger
to the country, ' and these conclusions characterize the overall tenor
of the draft. Numerous selective quotes are incorporated in the
report from documents and depositions, some of which are obviously
out of context. Former Assistant to the Director William C, Sullivan
is cited, as are former Assistant Director Charles D, Brennan and
Section Chief George C. Moore of the INTD. Also, INTD supervisors
Thomas J, Deakin, Russell Horner (retired) and David Ryan are cited
extensively. The report concludes Cointelpros became more damag-
ing to constitutional rights as they progressed, with the latter two
programs targeting Black Nationalists and New Left, the most
offensive. Selective, incomplete summaries of numerous Cointelpro
actions are cited, usually without characterizing the subversive or
extremist nature of the targets or detailing the true objective of the
FBI. While the report indicates the FBI notified the Executive and
Legislative Branches regarding the existence of the Cointelpros, it
downplays this effort by indicating the notification was vague and
incomplete and by citing two former Attorneys General alleged
ignorance of the programs. An effort is made to discredit the review
of the Department (Petersen Committee of the Criminal Division) and
Civil Rights Division review of Cointelpros as incomplete.

ACTION:

That the attached letter enclosing a memorandum setting
forth the comments of the Special Agents who reviewed the draft
report be forwarded to the Attorney General for his information and
for possible referral to the SSC and/or the White House.

DETAILS:

On 3/2-3/76, Intelligence Division Supervisors Don K.
Pettus, Arthur G, Pote and David Ryan visited the SSC offices at the
Dirksen Office Building to review the 133-page (double spaced)
Committee draft report on discontinued FBI Cointelpros. Barbara
Banoff of the Committee staff made available three copies of the SSC
draft report dated 2/24/76, entitled "Cointelpro: The FBI's Covert
Action Programs against American Citizens," which were to be
reviewed for classification. The copies of the draft report were
noted ''Sensitive" and it was indicated each copy was one of 13.

Classification; Two items appearing in the draft report
were deemed by the reviewers to require classification of "Secret"
or higher as their disclosure could jeopardize sensitive sources
and/or techhiques in the foreign intelligence area. These two items
were identified on a separate sheet of paper and furnished to the SSC
on 3/3/76. They are being identified by separate memorandum.

Statement to SSC Staff: Upon completion of the review of
the draft. on 3/3/76, the FBI representatives submitted in a sealed
envelope to Miss Banoff a statement reading as follows:

At the invitation of the Senate Select Committee
(SSC) staff, on 3/2-3/76, FBI representatives reviewed
the draft report of the Committee, dated 2/24/76,
entitled, "Cointelpro: The FBI's Covert Action Pro-
grams against American Citizens."* Items appearing
in this report which require classification have been
separately identified on this date to the SSC staff.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

The SSC draft report is based upon selective docu-
mentation using out-of-context quotes from FBI corre-
spondence and depositions in support of conclusions
which are phrased in a subjective and condemnatory
manner in language calculated to present the Bureau in
a most unfavorable light.

As the entirety of the draft is couched in phrases
intended to indicate the Bureau deliberately violated con-
stitutional rights, and that that violation was in fact its
motive; and as the FBI reviewers had no concurrent
access to the depositions and other documentation
referred to in the draft, it is felt no purpose would be
served in attempting to refute the allegations page by
page. Nor would any valid purpose be served in attempt-
ing to argue with or contradict conclusions reached by
the draft's authors. Therefore, no comment will be
made on the content of the draft.

Finally, it is a matter of concern that inadequate
consideration was given to the rights of privacy of those
mentioned directly or indirectly in the draft, whether
private citizens, organizations which cooperated with
the FBI, or officials.

In reference to the above statement, the FBI reviewers
asked for a copy of SA Ryan's deposition which had previously been
submitted to the Committee so it could be checked against the draft
to verify the accuracy of statements attributed to Ryan in the draft
and also to determine if they had been utilized out of context. After

Memorandum to Mr. T, W, Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

checking with the Committee Security Officer, Miss Banoff advised
the FBI reviewers would not be afforded access to any depositions or
other supporting documentation of the Committee.

Editorialization by the SSC: The draft, on its first page,
alleges "Cointelpro is the story of decent men who did terrible
things for what they saw as the greater good of the country, " without
any supporting material. Later, and throughout the report, it is
indicated 'The techniques were adopted wholesale from wartime
intelligence, " apparently paraphrasing information furnished to the
Committee by former Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan
who is cited in the report as describing counterintelligence as
"dirty ousiness."" "The unexpressed major premise of programs
(Cointelpros) was that a law enforcement agency has not only the
right but the duty to maintain the existing social and political order
by secretly manipulating thoughts and behavior and to immobilize
those who threaten that order by seeking activity to change it or by
adopting visibly different life styles.'' Further in the report,
Cointelpro is described as "a declaration of war on the advocates of
change" and also characterized as a "sophisticated vigilante operation."
The draft attempts to depict the Bureau in a most unfavorable light
by such statements as "The image of an agent of the U. S. Govern-
ment scrawling a poisoned pen letter to somebody's wife in language
usually reserved for a bathroom's walls is not a happy one. '*
Finally, the draft alleges "The instances of attacks on speaking,
teaching, writing and meeting go on and on." There follow several
examples of "attacks, '' leading to the draft's statement that "The only
conclusion that can be drawn from the cases is that the Bureau con-
sidered the First Amendment a danger to the country, " a conclusion
which is felt to be characteristic of the overall tenor of the language
of the draft.

Memorandum to Mr. T, W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Quotes from Depositions: Among the present and former
Bureau officials quoted in the draft are former Assistant to the Direc-
tor William C, Sullivan, Assistant Director Charles D, Brennan,
Section Chief George C. Moore, and Supervisors Thomas J. Deakin,
Russell Horner and David Ryan, all of the INTD, As noted above,
access to the full depositions of these officials is apparently not avail-
able even to those who furnished said depositions.

However, Ryan's deposition is quoted in the draft in
several instances in a mamner believed to be inaccurate or at best
distorted to support SSC conclusions. It is indicated in the draft that
Ryan, in his deposition, described "fellow travelers" as "those taking
positions supported by the communists, such as school integration,
increased minority hiring and opposition to HUAC."" Although Ryan
recalls defining ‘fellow travelers" in his deposition, the description
furnished in the draft report is not recalled, is not in his wording,
and is not in accordance with his views.

Also, in a footnote further in the report, a number of
lurid and sexually oriented techniques are cited followed by the state-
ment "The subject could go on, but the subject is,'as Ryan put it,’
‘degrading. ''' Ryan specifically remembers his use of the word
"degrading" was in reference to the insistence of SSC staff members
to discuss sexually oriented techniques to'the exclusion of all others
during his deposition, and not to characterize Cointelpro. (Banoft
was orally advised by Ryan on 3/3/%6 of this distortion),

Definition of "New Left’: In an obvious attempt to support
its contention that the Titles of the various Cointelpros and the targets
were vague and ill-defined, the draft report indicates "nor could any-
one at the Bureau even define 'New Left'" on page 4. This statement

Memorandum to Mr. T, W. Leavitt

is again reported on page 9. However, on page 40, in an apparent
self-contradiction, the report states "Some agents defined 'New Left'
functionally, by connection with protest. Others defined it by philos-
ophy, particularly antiwar philosophy." The draft report ignores the
fact that former Assistant Director Brennan, in his public testimony
before the SSC, was asked to and did define "New Left." Additionally,
Ryan in his deposition indicated to the SSC he could define 'New Left”
but did not believe it pertinent to his testimony. One former INTD
supervisor is cited in the report as stating in his deposition he was
unable to define "New Left, "' and that he recalled no specific defini-
tion in Bureau documents.

Emphasis on Black Nationalist and New Left Programs:
While the report indicates over half of all Cointelpro actions were
conducted in the program which targeted the Communist Party, USA
(CPUSA), specific actions in this area are alluded to in a vague and
generalized manner. The report concludes the Cointelpros became
more damaging to constitutional rights as they progressed, with the
final two programs, which targeted Black Nationalists and New Left,
the most offensive. Selective incomplete summaries of numerous
Cointelpro actions targeting such groups.as the Black Panther Party
(BPP) are cited with either no characterization of their propensity
for violence or with incompleté descriptions regarding their extremist
or subversive nature.

| A specific example of failure to characterize an organiza~
tion with a propensity for violence occurred in the summary of a
Cointelpro action directed against a member of the Black Liberators.
A characterization of the organization. would have disclosed it as a
pseudo military group composed of black militants who sought open
confrontation with the establishment and emulated the BPP in its aims.
In addition to the failure to characterize organizations, no effort was made .

throughout the draft to outline the true objective of the FBI or to
indicate any positive results were obtained in any instance. Also,
on one occasion the report cites in some detail a suggested technique
of a sensationalist nature which the draft states was ''apparently"
dropped, ignoring a communication furnished to the SSC reflecting
that the proposal had been dropped.

Unreported Cointelpro Activities: Quoting former
Assistant to the Director Sullivan, the draft report states that although
the formal program was instituted in 1956, Cointelpro-type activities
had been conducted by the FBI for years. It cites the originating
Cointelpro document in the CPUSA as indicating an "ad hoc" Cointelpro
consisting of "harassment" had existed for years primarily operated
by the field offices. The formal Cointelpros are described as an
effort by the FBI to expand and formalize the scope and targets.

The SSC draft comments that it had been advised of two
Cointelpro actions effected after FBI Headquarters issued instructions
that the programs be discontinued and indicates a comprehensive
review of FBI files would undoubtedly uncover numerous others.

To support this contention, the report states the SSC dis-
covered a third instance of Cointelpro action which occurred four
months after termination of the programs. This instance involved
the furnishing of information to a friendly newspaper source under
the so-called "Mass Media Program" intended to discredit an
attorney and his client. A footnote at this point in the report indicates
that Charles Colson spent seven months in jail for similar activity
involving the client.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

An effort is made in the draft report to indicate Cointelpro
actions were conducted under other titles and, as alleged by the
Socialist Workers Party, are still being conducted in the form of
harassment interviews, contacts with employers, etc. The draft
states '. . . actions in the Rev. Martin Luther King case which
cannot, by any stretch of the language, be called 'investigative' were
not called Cointelpro, but.were carried under the investigative caption.”

Inciting Violence: The report makes an extensive effort
by citing selective actions to indicate Cointelpro intended to incite
violence, including murders. In what appears to be an obvious
attempt to. characterize the FBI as unconcerned regarding violence,
former Section Chief 'Moore was asked whether the fact no one was
killed was the result of 'luck or plan.' He answered: 'Oh, it just
happened that way, Iam sure.'' Numerous examples of actions
directed against the BPP, and particularly the BPP-US feud, are
cited to indicate the FBI incited violence which could be attiributed to
actual murders. Frequent reference is made io "snitch jacket" tech-
niques which are described as "labeling a group member an informant
when he is not." Although this expression is not known to have been
utilized within the Bureau, the report accredits it to former Section
Chief Moore and indicates this technique could well result in violence.
The report does indicate in one instance in 1971 a technique was
"rejected because of the possibility it would result in a target's death."
It downplays these instructions by stating two other unidentified tech-
niques which could result in murder were approved shortly thereafter.

The draft report indicates a separate report is being pre-
pared on disruptive efforts aimed at the Panthers and it "will examine
in detail the Bureau's attempts to foment violence."

Memorandum to Mr. T., W, Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75

Notification: In a more objective treatment, the draft
report sets out in some 15 pages details relating to Bureau documen-
tation alerting members of the Executive Branch, including the
Cabinet, and members of the Legislative Branch to the existence of
the Cointelpros. However, it is indicated that only the CPUSA and
White Hate Programs were discussed in documents notifying offi-
cials outside the Bureau, and in these instances the references to
Cointelpro were generalized or vague. The report emphasized the
Fiscal Year 1963 budget testimony explicitly outlines our Cointelpro
efforts, but questions that such information was ever presented
before the Subcommittee on Appropriations.

Department Review: The draft report criticizes the
Department of Justice review of FBI Cointelpros (Petersen report)
as incomplete, implying cover-up or a lack of penetrative interest,
It is indicated Department attorneys working with the Petersen
Committee were not allowed to work with original Bureau files/docu-
ments and were required to rely on FBI-prepared write-ups which
were incomplete. Portions of legal memoranda which appeared as
exhibits in the original Petersen report, and which have not previ-
ously been publicized, are cited in the SSC draft and these, too, are
taken out of context or limited to support contentions of the SSC. The
SSC draft differs with the conclusions of the Petersen Report in that
interferences with First Amendment rights in the Cointelpros were
"insubstantial" and also in the Petersen report classification of some
techniques as “legitimate."' It is indicated that although the Petersen
report concluded infringements upon First Amendment rights consti-
tuted only a small percentage of the overall techniques, the victims
in these instances would not consider the attack upon their rights as
insubstantial.

Memorandum to Mr. T, W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

In regard to the review of the Cointelpros by representa-
tives of the Civil Rights Division, the SSC draft indicates the decision
that prosecution was not warranted was "a finding endorsed by
Assistant Attorney General Stanley Pottinger after a hasty two-day
review of the documents in 1975." (On 3/3/76 Ryan pointed out to
Banoff that in his deposition he had indicated he had been present
when representatives of the Civil Rights Division, including Pottinger,
had reviewed the Cointelpro files and he considered the review had
been thorough, both as relates to general and specific areas. Banoff
responded by saying Pottinger, himself, had been interviewed and
had indicated his review had been "hasty." It is noted Civil Rights
Division attorneys reviewed the five basic Cointelpros on three
separate days and spent an additional day reviewing more recently
uncovered FBI Cointelpro files. )

Miscellaneous: Typical of distortions appearing in the
SSC draft was the statement "As David Ryan, Chief of the Cointelpro
Unit, . ." which indicates an overall responsibility of Ryan for over-
all Cointelpro activity. (Banoff was advised on 3/3/76 that in his
deposition he indicated he had been a Unit Chief responsible for
Cointelpro during the period 1963-67, and his primary involvement
was with the CPUSA effort. Banoff agreed the phrase was a distor-
tion and commented she realized Ryan had no involvement with the
Black Nationalist or New Left Programs. )

The SSC draft cites Supervisor Thomas J, Deakin as

", . . the only Bureau witness to have reservations about Cointelpro's
constitutionality,'' Continuing, the report states "Another witness

gave a more typical response, When asked whether anybody at any
time during the course of the programs discussed their constitution-
ality or legal authority, he replied "No, we never gave it a thought.'
(Moore deposition), "*

Information set forth above is typical of the distorted
character of the SSC report. Ryan specifically recalls when he was
being deposed he was questioned if consideration had been given to
the constitutionality of Cointelpro techniques and he responded affirm-
atively. Ryan not only indicated this was a continuing consideration,
but he cited examples. One example which appears in Ryan's deposi-
tion relates to Cointelpro efforts to expose and preclude clandestine
Communist Party use of meeting halls. Ryan advised former
Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont had questioned the consti-
tutional proprieties of such action as possible violations of the First
Amendment rights, and efforts had been made to preclude such
infringements. It would appear the SSC staff selectively and deliber-
ately ignores information available to it furnished by witnesses.

Notionals (fictitious organizations) are briefly alluded to
in the draft report. Three examples are given. One relates to an
organization whose members are all Bureau informants. The report
indicates a notional chapter of the W. E, B, DuBois Club was con-

. Sidered but never effected. A second type organization is described

as one with unsuspecting (non-informant) members, and in this
example the establishment of a Klan organization under the control

of a Bureau informant (the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan)

is mentioned, indicating the Bureau paid the informant's expenses in
setting up this 250-member group. The third example relates to an
organization which is wholly fictitious for the purpose of disseminating
propaganda. The Committee for Expansion of Socialist Thought in
America (CESTA) is described as such a group. CESTA attacked the

CPUSA from the Marxist right for two years in approximately 1965-67,
Although the SSC draft is not severely critical of CESTA, it makes

no effort to point out evidence indicating the operations was success-
ful, it being noted this information was available to it.

While at the SSC offices, staff member Walter Ricks fur-
nished the FBI reviewers pages 17-52 of the SSC draft report relating
to FBI/Internal Revenue Service (IRS) matters, and specifically to
disclosure by IRS of tax information to the FBI, This report indicates
approximately 200 requests were made by the FBI for tax returns
between 1966 and 1974, and 130 of these were for domestic intelli-
gence or "counterintelligence!' purposes. It is indicated the 130
requests primarily related to New Left and black extremist matters,
Although a large portion of this report cites the use of tax informa-
tion for Cointelpro purposes, the reviewers advised Ricks they were
not primarily responsible for reviewing this section of the SSC draft
report.

A copy of referenced SSC request is attached below

to the current SSC request for a list or itemization, the

following should be noted. J, 4, Deegan to Mr. W. R. Wannall

memorandum 12/18/75, reported the request of Mr. Shaheen of

the Depertment for a list of the reported 25 COINTELPRO«type

activities the FBI engaged in against King. He stated that

the request was channeled to him from the Attorney General

through Fhilip White of the Criminal Division. We then prepared

such an informol listing and delivered a copy to Shaheen as

noted in the Deegan memorandum and we noted that with little

exception, all the meterial referred to on the list had

previously been given to the SSC, including underlying documents.

In connection with the current SSC request, Mr. Shaheen was

consulted by Supervisor S. F, Fhillips of the SENSTUDY 75 Project

and he agreed that it was unnecessary to prepare any actuel

list or itemization but merely refer the SSC to its prior

requests and our responses thereto, This has been done in

the LHM now going forward.

4ssociate Director James B, Adams testified before the Committee
thet there had been "25 incidents of FBI harassment with respect
to Martin Luther King, Jr." The SSC requested an itemization
of the incidents to which Mr. Adams was referring. The request
also noted the assumption of the SSC that all underlying
materiels pertaining to each of the incidents had been previously
supplied to the Committee and that in the event this wes not
the case, the SSC desired copies of such mrteriels,

In connection with Mr. Adams' testimony it is noted
that et one point he was questioned by SSC Chairman Frank Church
about FBI efforts to discredit King. in answering a specific
question as to the efforts of the FBI to prevent King from
having en audience with the Pope, Adams steted, “There were
approximately 25 incidents, I believe, of actions teken in this
regard, I think Mr. Schwarz has those available, that I would
lump basically all of them into the same situation... ."

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT FRANCIS T. LEONARD BY SSC STAFF
MEMBER MICHAEL EPSTEIN

On Friday, February 27, 1976, at approximately 10:30
A. M., Special Agent Francis T. Leonard, who is currently
assigned to the Boston Division, met with SSC Staff Member
Michael Epstein in a room on the sixth floor of the 01d Senate
Office Building, Washington, D. C.

Special Agent Leonard was not provided with a warning
as to his vights nor was he placed under oath at the outset of
the interview.

The only two occupants of the room at the outset of
this interview were Leonard and Epstein. Epstein ascertained
from Leonard that he had entered on duty as a Special Agent
with the FBI on August 6, 1951, and had been assigned to the
New York Office from April 1955 to May 1967. Leonard stated
that during the period from 1955 through approximately 1964,
his work entailed investigations regarding the internal security
of the United States. —

Epstein inquired as to what role Leonard played in the
investigation of one Stanley David Levison. Leonard replied that
he was the case Agent of the Stanley David Levison investigation
during the late 1950s and early 1960s although he could not be
sure of the exact years because of the extensive period of time
that has elapsed since he was involved n that investigation.
Epstein queried Leonard as to his recollection of how he became
the case Agent in the Levison case, and Leonard replied that to
the best of his recollection the Levison case was reopened and
assigned to him based on new information that Levison was a
secret member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA).

This decument contains neither
recommendations nor conclusions

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE on INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT FRANCIS T. LEONARD BY SSC STAFF
MEMBER MICHAEL EPSTEIN

At this point Epstein stated wasn't it in fact Levison's
association with Martin Luther King, Jr., that led to the
veopening of the case and Leonard replied that he was positive
that was not the reason for the reopening of the case but
rather information regarding Levison's activities with the
CPUSA. Epstein inquired as to specifically what these
activities of Levison's were and Leonard refused to reveal
them because he felt that by so doing, he may jeopardize the
security of a highly reliable source of the Bureau that had
furnished the information regarding Levison. Leonard further
explained that he felt this would be in violation of the agree-
ment between the Bureau and the Committee if he should reveal
this information.

Epstein then showed Special Agent Leonard a memorandum
bearing his name to the SAC, New York, dated August 22, 1962,
entitled Stanley David Levison and asked Leonard if he recalled
the memo. Special Agent Leonard stated that he did not recall
the memo but that undoubtedly it was his memo and appeared to
be a characterization of Stanley David Levison. Epstein then
inquired as to what the procedure was for formulating such a
characterization and it was explained to him by Special Agent
Leonard to the best of his knowledge. At this point Epstein
stated that he would prefer to continue the interview with the
presence of a court stenographér and asked if Special Agent
Leonard had any objection to that. Special Agent Leonard
replied that he had no objection to a court stenographer being
present. At this point the interview was terminated at ‘approxi-
mately 11:05 A. M.

The interview was resumed at 11:25 A. M. in the same
room with the court stenographer present and all the informa-
tion discussed in the first interview was repeated for the
benefit of the court stenographer up to and including the dis-
cussion regarding the characterization of Stanley David Levison
dated August 22, 1962. At that point in the second interview,
Epstein held up a report on Martin Luther King, Jr., written
by Special Agent John Elliott of the New York Office. Epstein
asked Leonard if he knew Elliott and he replied that he did. ‘He
did not make the report available to Leonard but Epstein then

SEBRET

‘SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT FRANCIS T. LEONARD BY SSC STAFF
MEMBER MICHAEL EPSTEIN

asked Leonard if he was aware of any relationship between
Stanley David Levison and Martin Luther King prior to Leonard
being assigned the case Agent of the Levison investigation.
Leonard replied that he was not. At this point Epstein
referred to page 17 of Elliott's report and gave the follow-
ing four dates: December 26, 1956; September 24, 19583
January 18, 1959; and May 6, 1960; on which it was reported
by sources of the FBI that there was a relationship between
Stanley David Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr.

At this point Epstein produced-another memorandum
written by Special Agent Leonard to the SAC, New York, dated
July 26, 1963, which was another characterization of Stanley
David Levison stating that he was a secret member of the CPUSA.
Epstein asked Leonard if he recalled writing such a memorandum
and he replied that, although he did not recall it, obviousiy
it was a memorandum written by hima that time. Again Epstein
and Leonard discussed the administrative procedure that would
be used by the New York Office to make up a characterization
eard regarding an individual. During this portion of the con-
versation, Epstein asked Leonard if he knew the identity of
the Agent who handled the highly reliable source that was
used to characterize Stanley David Levison. Leonard stated
that he did know the identity of the Agent but refused to
disclose it because by so doing it could lead to the identifica-
tion of this highly reliable source of information. At this
point Epstein asked Leonard what he meant when he said Levison
was a secret member of the Communist Party and Leonard pointed
out to Epstein that it was not Leonard but the source of this
information who described Levison as a secret member of the
Communist Party and that Leonard was merely repeating that for
the purpose of making a characterization of Levison. Epstein
then asked Leonard,what his definition was of a secret member
of the CP and Leonard said he could only give his own definition
because he was not aware of the criteria that Bureau headquarters
or the New York Office would have for such a definition. Epstein
stated that he desired Leonard to give his own definition which
he furnished as follows:

‘SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT FRANCIS T. LEONARD BY SSC STAFF
MEMBER MICHAEL EPSTEIN

1. An individual that would not openly take
part in any CPUSA function such as a national
convention or state or district convention.

2. An individual who would not be carried on any
membership list.

3.. Not to be a card carrying member of the CP.

4, Not to be publicly associated with any known
members of the CP, socially or otherwise.

Leonard further stated that a secret member would be an
individual who adhered to and supported the principle of the
CPUSA, that is, to overthrow the United States Government by
force and violence and that a secret member would make a
contribution toe the CPUSA in order that they could accomplish
that goal whether it be financial or otherwise.

Epstein then asked if the FBI made any effort to
establish Stanley David Levison's connection with the CPUSA
other than that which was furnished by the highly reliable
source referred to earlier in this memorandum. Leonard stated
that there was a constant effort made by physical surveillances
and contact with other sources of information to determine a
relationship between Stanley Levison and other CP members.
Epstein asked if Leonard participated in any physical surveillances
of Stanley Levison and Leonard stated that he did recall taking
part in such physical surveillances but could not recall the
results of these surveillances.

Epstein and Leonard then discussed memoranda regard-
ing technical surveillances of Stanley David Levison in very
general terms. Epstein asked if Leonard could recall any
evidence of Stanley Levison influencing the civil rights movement
at the direction of the CPUSA and Special Agent Leonard answered
that he could not.

The interview was terminated with two last questions,
one regarding the fact that if Special Agent Leonard had

knowledge that microphones were installed at one time or another
in the hotel rooms of Martin Luther King and Leonard answered
that he had recollection of general information to that effect
‘and, secondly, did Special Agent Leonard know William Sullivan
(presumably former Assistant Director William Sullivan) and
Special Agent Leonard replied his only personal relationship
with Sullivan was when Sullivan lectured to Leonard's training
class in 1951. °

The interview was terminated at approximately 1:35 P. M.
on February 27, 1976.

Dear Judge Tyler:

In your letter of February 10, 1976, you indicated that the
Department and the FBI are prepared to cooperate with us in respond-
ing to the request of the Government Information and Individual
Rights Subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations,
provided existing guidelines and agreements established between the
Department and GAO are honored. The Subcommittee had requested that

we review and describe al] lists and indices of individuals maintained
by the FBI for investigative purposes.

We have discussed with the Subcommittee staff your proposal and
the guidelines under which we reviewed and reported on the FBI's
domestic intelligence operations. The Subcommittee staff believes
the proposed arrangement and existing guidelines are generally
satisfactory.

7 It is our intention in this review. as well as in future reviews
of FBI programs and activities, to observe the general rules governing
the handling and disclosure of information which we established with
the FBI pursuant to the domestic intelligence review.’ In this regard,
we will take all necessary precautions to protect any documents pro-
vided to us and will honor any security classifications applied to
those documents. All information will be treated in the greatest
confidence and in accordance with FBI security standards to prevent
even inadvertent release of sensitive information. As we did with

our report on the FBI's domestic intelligence operations, issued
February 24, 1976, we will give the FBI the opportunity to review

the draft report on the results of We pe) Ss, whether

it contains any sensitive information which the FBI believes might
compromise its operations.. Also, if during our review we receive
any requests for specific Department and/or FBI documents or files,
we will refer the requestor to the Department or FBI.

We are prepared to abide by the above ground rules; however, as
stated in my letter of December 30, 1975, to you, we must have access
to all persons and all records and documentation necessary to conduct
our review and answer the Subcommittee's request. We do not presently
foresee the need for investigative files to complete our review. We
cannot preclude that possibility, however, and would have to insist
on access to such files if the need arises.

Although any guidelines and agreements established between GAO
and. the Department pursuant to our review of FBI activities would be
honored regardless of which GAO auditors are involved, the review for
the Subcommittee will be conducted by the same staff that conducted
the domestic intelligence review. Since the Subcommittee requested
our review in November 1975, the staff would like to begin work at
FBI Headquarters as soon as possible in order to expedite our response.
We will coordinate with FBI officials in this regard.

We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
Sincerely yours,

Re: Solo
100-428091

We believe the excisions were made properly as the
reasons for excisions do not pinpoint the SOLO operation and
the information is described as coming from several sources.

Previous references to SOLO data have been made
public and this operation has continued for over 24 years.
Some examples of prior disclosures are: (1) Newspaper article
by Victor Riesel on 4/14/64 which published the agenda for a
highly’ secret CPUSA meeting which was reported on by CG 5824;
(2) Another article by Riesel on 5/14/64 which comments on
“Moscow Gold," the Soviet funding of the CPUSA; (3) The

_ printed report of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of
- Representatives, considering the impeachment of former: .
President Nixon which was made available to the public in
mid-1974 contains on Page 408, Book VII, Part I, a phrase
from thé Huston report that the CPUSA receives most of its
finances from the Soviet Union; (4) John Barron's 1974 book
"KGB" identified NY 694's Soviet contact as V. A. Chuchukin as
a KGB officer and described him as a disinformation officer;
and (5) The 12/1/75 issue of "Time Magazine" reports the basis
for FBI investigation of Martin Luther King was information
received in 1963 from two high-level CPUSA officials regarding
communist party penetration of King's organization. As a result |
of the publication of the "KGB" book, the Soviets suspended the
SOLO operation for six months.

A conference has been scheduled to be held 3/17/76
with representatives of Chicago and New York Offices in
attendance at FBIHQ.’ We will-discuss the extent of damage to
this operation based upon the current release of information

. ,in the SSC Hearings, the value of the SOLO operation, and future
course of action.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt
R Solo eenannonwenee z
saree 28091

DETAILS :

SOLO is our code word covering a sensitive
network of highest-level. informants operating against the
Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), the Soviet Union, and other
communist parties of the world. SOLO informants handle the
liaison between CPUSA and USSR, including the transfer of
money to the CPUSA.

The printed report entitled "Hearings Before the
Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect
to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate, 94th
Congress, Volume 6, Federal Bureau of Investigation," contains
certain information concerning the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA)
beginning on page 822 which was reproduced from FBI documents.
Printed as reasons for excisions is the phrase that the
document was excised as it could identify sensitive sources
providing information concerning CPUSA funding and travel
abroad by CPUSA functionaries. Volume 2 of the above report
contains a statement that most of the CPUSA finances are from

‘the Soviet Union. The above- information has been furnished

Chicago and New York Offices and Chicago teletype 3/12/76
expressed concern about the above information which could
terminate _this operation.

» : Copies of the SSC meccings were released by SSC
Staff to the news media on 3/8/76; however, the general public
will not be able to purchase copies until about 4/15/76.

By way of background, Bureau letter 7/1/75 transmitted

to the Attorney General for his approval and for forwarding
to the SSC’a document (Bureau letter 1/19/61 to the
Honorable Robert F. Kennedy) which contained a summary memoran-
dum setting forth the overall activities of the CPUSA. This
memorandum was excised at FBIHQ and the reason for excisions

- was given as stated above, i.e., information concerned CPUSA
funding. By letter 11/14/75 to the Attorney General, Bureau
noted additional excisions which could be made to above
document which would result in its declassification from "Top
Secret;" thus authorizing the SSC to make it. available for

public hearings.

Memorandum toMr,. T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62+116395

A review of the SSC draft report on FBI Cointelpros on
3/23/76 by Intelligence Division supervisors determined that one
item which was unclassified should be classified "Secret." The
item, which appeared on page 78, paragraph 1, lines 68, read as
follows: ". « . to having the FBI Lab forge an informant*s report
in the target’s handwriting, thus making it extremely difficult for
him to deny the accusation,***"" SSC staff member Barbara Banoff
advised on 3/15/76 that the staff, after a review of this item, pro-
posed that "forge" be changed to "fake." She was telephonically
advised on 3/16/76 that the change was not acceptable to the Bureau.
She then proposed that the following unclassified sentence be inserted:
"The method of pointing the fingers range from having an authentic
informant start a rumor about the target member, to anonymous
letters or phone calls, to faked informant reports." Banoff then
advised this sentence would be substituted for the previous phrase
referring to the FBI Laboratory forging an informant*s report in the
target's handwriting,

The change now proposed by the SSC would seem to offer
no justification whatsoever for classification, and would appear to be
in such general terms that there is no danger that it would compro=
mise any of our sensitive intelligence sources and/or techniques.

If the proposed change is approved, the SSC will confirm it in writing
to this Bureau.

By letter dated 2/17/76 from F. A. 0.°Schwarz, Z
Counsel for captioned Committee, addressed to Michael E.
Shaheen, Jr., Counsel, Office of Professional Responsibility,
U. S. Department of Justice, procedures were set forth for
our review of draft reports relating to FBI activities. The
procedures allowed for our review for the purpose of determining
whether there were any “classifications (or other such problems,
e.g., the identity of informers) which may be inadvertently raised"
in the Committee's reports. The procedures were that these re-
ports would be reviewed in Committee space.

Subsequently, on 3/8/76, Mitchell Rogovin of CIA advised
that William Miller, Staff Director of captioned Committee, had
agreed to a procedure whereby the reports would be reviewed in Ss
the interested agency's space with the author of the report being.
available. Subsequent to the receipt of this information from
Rogovin, John T. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director of captioned
Committee, was advised by SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that
consistent with Miller's agreement the FBI in the future would
review the reports affecting the Bureau in Bureau space. EI11iff

ho apparently was unaware of this agreement said he saw no
problem with this procedure.

Dear Mike: .-— : : 7

Pursuant to my conversation today with Mr. Steve
Blackhurst .of your office, I wish to clarify and amplify
my request of February 4, 1976, Part II.

The Select Committee requests that the FBI pro-
vide any materials pertaining to the electronic surveil-
lance of White House staff officials under the administra-
tion of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944 and 1945,
specifically including the residence telephones of
Mr. Harry Hopkins and Mr. Thomas Corcoran. In addition,
the Select Committee requests materials pertaining to the
authorization and purpose of the electronic surveillances
from 1945 to 1948 represented by the material appearing
in the “official and confidential" files of Director Hoover.

Please expedite this matter as il is necessary
for inclusion in our report.

Sincerely,

ED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

On March.2-3, 1976, FBI Intelligence Division supervisors
visited the Senate Select Committee (SSC) offices at the Dirksen Office
Building to review the 133-page (double spaced) Committee draft

report on discontinued FBE Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros).

Barbara Banoff of the Committee staff made available three copies of
the SSC draft report dated February 24, 1976, entitled "Cointelpro:
The FBI's Covert Action Programs against American Citizens," which
were ta be reviewed for classification, The copies of the draft report
were noted "Sensitive" and it was indicated each copy was one of 13,

Classification: Two items appearing in the drait report
were deemed by the reviewers to require classification of "Secret"
or higher as their disclosure could jeopardize sensitive sources
and/or techniques in the foreign intelligence area. These two items
were identified on a separate sheet of paper and furnished to the SSC
on Iéarch 3, 1976,

Denial of Access te Supporting Documents: The FBI
reviewers asked for a copy of Speci: rent Ryan's deposition which
had previously been submitted te the Committee soit could be checked
against the draft to verify the accuracy of statements attributed to
Ryan in the draft and also to determine if they had been utilized out
of contest, After checking with the Committee Security Officer,

Miss Banoff advised the FBI reviewers would not be afforded access
to any depositions or other supporting documentation of the Committee,

United States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Editorialization by the SSC: The draft, on its first page,
alleges "Cointéelpro is the Stary df decent men who did terrible
things for what they saw as the greater good of the country," without
any supporting material. Later, and throughout the report, it is
indicated "The techniques were adopted wholesale from wartime
intelligence, " apparently paraphrasing inforraation furnished to the
Cozamittee by former Assistant to the Director William C, Sullivan
who is cited in the report as describing counterintelligence as
“dirty business," "The unexpressed major premise of programs
(Cointelpros} was that a law enforcement agency has not only the
right but the duty to maintain the existing social and political order
by secretly manipulating thoughts and behavior and to immobilize
those who threaten that order by seeking activity to change it or by
adopting visibly different life styles. Further in the report,
Cointelpro is described as "a declaration of war on the advocates of
change" and also characterized as a "sophisticated vigilante operation. "
The draft attempts to depict the Bureau in a most unfavorable light
by such statements as 'The image of an agent of the U. S, Govern-
ment scrawling a poisoned pen letter to somebody's wife in language
usually reserved for a bathroom's walls is not a happy one.”
Finally, the draft alleges "The instances of attacks on speaking,
teaching, writing and meeting go on and on." There follow several
examples of "attacks," leading to the drafi's statement that “The only
conclusion that can be drawn from the cases is that the Bureau con-
sidered the First Amendment a danger to the country," a conclusion
which is i to be characteristic of the overall tenor of the language
of the draft,

Guotes from Depositions: Among the present and former
Bureau officials quoted in the draft are former Assistant to the Direc~
tor William C. Sullivan, Assistant Director Charles D. Brennan,

United States Senate Select Covamittee

Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Seetion Chief George C, Moore, and €upervisors Thomas J, Deakin,
Russell Horner and David Ryan, all of the Intelligence Division (INTD),
As noted above, access to the full depositions of these officials is
apparently not available even to those who furnished said depositions.

However, Ryan's deposition is quoted in the draft in
several instances in a manner believed to bé inaccurate or at best
distorted ta support SSC conclusions. It is indicated in the draft that
Ryan, in his depositton, described "fellow travelers" as "those taking
positions supported by the communists, such as school integration,
increased minority hiring and opposition to HUAC," Although Ryan
recalls defining "fellow travelers" in his deposition, the description
furnished in the draft report is not recalled, is not in his wording,
and is not in accordance with his views.

Also, in a footnote further in the report, a number of
lurid and sexually oriented techniques are cited followed by the state-
ment "Dhe subject could go on, but the subject is, 'as Ryan put it, *
‘degrading. '"* Ryan specifically remembers his use of the word
"degrading" was in reference to the insistence of SSC staff members
to discuss sexually oriented techniques to the exclusion of all others
during his deposition, and not to characterize Cointelpro. (Sanoff
was orally advised by Ryan on March 3, 1976, of this distortion. }

Definition of "New Left": In an obvious attempt to support
its contention that ihe titles of the various Cointelpros and the targets
were vague and ill-defined, the draft report indicates "nor could any-
one at the Bureau even define 'New Left’ on page 4. This statexaent
is again reported on page 9. However, on page 40, in an apparent
self-contradiction, the report states "Sorae agents defined 'New Left"

Be



United States Senate Select Committee
‘To Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

functionally, by conection with protest. Others defined it by philos-
ophy, particularly antiwar philosophy." The draft report ignores the
fact that former Assistant Director Brennan, in his public testimony
before the SSC, was asked to and did define "New Left,” Additionally,
Ryan in his deposition indicated to the ESC he could define "New Left"
but did not believe it pertinent to his testimony, One former INTD
supervisor is cited in the report as stating in his deposition he was
unable te define "New Left,” and that he recalled no specific defini-
tion in Bureau documents,

(An FSi document dated October 28, 1963, captioned
"New Left Movement," contains a detailed definition of "New Left."
A copy of this document was referred to the SSC and it appears as
Exhibit 61 on page 669 in Volume 6 of the published SSC hearings
relating to the FBI, November 18-19, December 2-3, 9+11, 1975.)

Emphasis on Black Nationalist and New Left Programs:
While the réport indicates over half of all Cointelpro actions were
conducted in the program which targeted the Communist Party, USA
(CPUSA), specific actions in this area are alluded to in a vague and
generalized manner, The report concludes the Cointelpros became
more damaging to constitutional rights as they progressed, with the
final two programs, which targeted Black Nationalists and New Left,
the most offensive, Selective, incomplete summaries of nuraerous
Cointelpro actions targeting such groups as the Black Panther Party
(BPP) are cited with either no characterization of their propensity
for violence or with incomplete descriptions regarding their extremist
or subversive nature.

A specific example of failure to characterize an organi-
zation with a propeasity for violence occurred in the summary of 9
Cointelpro action directed against a member of the Black Liberators.

United States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities (GSC)

A characterization of the organization would have disclosed it as a
pseudomilitary group composed of black militants who sought open
confrontation with the establishment and emulated the BYP in its aims,
In addition to the failure to characterize organizations, no effort was
made throughout the draft to outline the true objective of the FSI or

to indicate any positive results were obtained in any instance, Also,
on one occasion the report cites in some detail a suggested technique
of a2 sensationalist nature which the draft states was “apparently”
dropped, ignoring a communication furnished to the SSC reflecting
that the proposal had been dropped,

Unreported Cointelpro Activities: Quoting former
Assistant to the Director Sullivan, the drait report states that
although the formal program was instituted in 1956, Cointelpro-type
activities had been conducted by the FEI for years. Ht cites the orig~
inating Cointelpro document in the CPUSA as indicating an "ad hoc”
Cointelpro consisting of harassment” had existed for years primarily
operated by the field offices. The formal Cointelpros are described
as an effort by the #81 to expand and formalize the seope and targets.

The SSC draft comments that it had been advised of two
Cointelpro actions effected after Gi Headquarters issued instructions
that the programs be discontinued and indicates a comprehensive
review of FRI files would undeubtedly uncover numerous others,

To support this contention, the report states the SSC dis-
covered a third instance of Cointelpro action which occurred four
months after termination of the programs. This instance involved
the furnishing of information te a friendly newspaper souree under
the so-called "iass Media Program" intended to discredit an
attorney and his client, A footnote at this point in the report indicates
that Charles Colson spent seven months in jail for similar activity
involving the client,

~5-



DocId:32989587 Page 74

‘Onited States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

(Although the above-described action might be described
as of » Cointelpro-type, it was not conducted under any Cointelpro,
The action is not specifically identified in the S&C draft report, but
in Volume 6 of published SSC hearings, November 18-19,

December 2-3, 9-11, 1975, the action is described in testimony of
SSC staff member Joim Eiff appearing on page 165, and in staff
report entitled "Political Abuse and the FBI" which appears as
Exhibit 36 on page 470, The action relates to FGI furnishing of public
record information to a newsman regarding the coramunist assocla-
tions of Leonard B. Boudin, attorney for Daniel Elisberg, Exhibit 37,
page 486 of the same published volume, indicates the action wag con-
ducted under the Boudin caption without reference to Cointelpro.)

An effort is made in the draft report to indicate
Cointelpre actions were conducted under other titles and, as alleged
by the Socialist Workers Party, are still being conducted in the form
of harassment interviews, contacts with employers, etc. The draft
states ", . . actions in the Rev. Martin Luther King case which
cannot, by any stretch of the language, be called ‘investigative’ were
not called Cointelpro, but were carried under the investigative caption."

Inciting Violence: The report makes an extensive effort
by citing selective actions to indicate Cointelpro intended to incite
violence, including murders. In what appears to be an obvious
attempt to characterize the FBI as unconcerned regarding violence,
former Section Chief "ivcore was asked whether the fact na one was
killed was the result of ‘luck or plan.’ He answered: ‘Oh, it just
happened that way, Iam sure."’ Numerous examples of actions
directed against the BPP, and particularly the BPP-US feud, are
cited to indicate the FSI incited violence which could be attributed ta

~G-



i

United States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to intelligence Activities (SSC)

actual murders. Frequent reference is made to "snitch jacket" tech-
niques which are described as "labeling a group member an informant
when he is not,’ Although this expression is not known to have been
utilized within the Bureau, the report accredits it to former Section
Chief Moore and indicates this technique could well result in violence.
The report does indicate in one instance in 1971 a technique was
"rejected because of the possibility it would result in a target's death,”
It downplays these instructions by stating two other unidentified tech-
niques which could result in murder were approved shortly thereafter.

The draft report indicates a separate report is being pre-
pared on disruptive efforts aimed at the Panthers and it "will examine
in detail the Bureau's attempts to foment violence." —

Notification: in 9 more objective treatment, the draft
report sets dat in Some 15 pages details relating to Bureax documen-
tation alerting members of the Executive Branch, including the
Cabinet, and members of the Legislative Branch to the existence of
the Cointelpros. However, it is indicated that only the CPUSA and
White Hate Programs were discussed in documents notifying offi-
Gials outside the Bureau, and in these instances the references ta
Cointelpro were generalized or vague. The report emphasized the
Fiscal Year 1963 budget testimony explicitly outlines our Cointelpro
efforts, but questions that such information was ever presented
before the Subcommittee on Appropriations.

Departinent Review: The draft report criticizes the
Department of Justice review of FBI Cointelpros (Petersen report)
aS incomplete, implying cover-up or a lack of penetrative interest,
It is indicated Department attorneys working with the Petersen
Committee were not alowed to work with original Bureau files/docu-
raents and were required ta rely on FBI-prepared write-ups which
were incomplete, Portions of legal memoranda which appeared as
exhibits in the original Petersen report, and which have not previ-
ously been publicized, are cited in the SSC draft and these, too,

United States Cenate Select Committee

Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

are taken out of context or limited to support contentions of the SSC.
The SSC draft differs with the conclusions of the Petersen report in
that interferences with First Amendment rights in the Cointelpros
were "insubstantial" and also in the Petersen report classification
of Some techniques as "legitimate," It is indicated that although the
Petersen report concluded infringements upon First Amendment
rights constituted only a small percentage of the overall techniques,
the victims in these instances would not consider the attack upon
their rights as insubstantial.

In regard to the review of the Cointelpros by representa
tives of the Civil Rights Division, the SSC draft indicates the decision
that prosecution was not warranted was "a finding endorsed by
Assistant Attorney General Stanley Pottinger after a hasty two-day
review of the documents in 1975." (On March 3, 1976, Ryan pointed
out to Banoff that in his deposition he had indicated he had been
present when representatives of the Civil Rights Division, iicludinz
Pottinger, had reviewed the Cointelpro files and he considered the
review had been thorough, as relates to both general and specific
areas, Banoif responded by saying Pottinger, himself, had been
interviewed and had indicated his review had been “hasty. It is
noted Civil Rights Division attorneys reviewed the five basic
Cointelpros on three separate days and spent an additional day review-
ing more recently uncovered FBE Cointelpro files. )

Miscellaneous: Typical of distortions appearing in the
SSC draft was the statement "As David Ryan, Chief of the Cointelpro
Unit. . .” which indicates an overall responsibility of Ryan for over-
all Cointelpro activity. (Banoff was advised on March 3, 1976, that
in his deposition he indicated he had been a, Unit Chief responsible
for Cointelpro during the period 1963-67, and his primary involve-
ment was with the CPUSA effort. Banoff agreed the phrase was a
distortion and commented she realized Ryan had no involvement
with the Black Nationalist og New Left Programs. )

-8-



United States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to intelligence Activities (SSC)

The S&C draft cites Supervisor Thomas J, Deakin as
", ,. the only Bureau witness to have reservations about Cointelpro's
constitutionality."" Continuing, the report states "Another witness
gave a, more typical response. When asked whether anybody at any
time during the course of the progrars discussed their constitution-
ality or legal authority, he replied,'No, we never gave it a thought.
(ioore deposition), "

information set forth above is typical of the distorted
character of the SSC report. Ryan specifically recalls when he was
being deposed he was questioned if consideration had been given to
the constitutionality of Cointelpro techniques and he responded affirm-
atively, Ryan not only indicated this was a continuing cousideration,
but he cited exaraples. One example which appears in Ryan's deposi-
tion relates to Cointelpro efforts to expose and preclude clandestine
Communist Party use of meeting halls, Ryan advised former
Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont had questioned the consti«
tutional proprieties of such action as possible violations of the First
Amendment rights, and efforts had been made to preciude such
infringements.

Notionals (fictitious organizations) are briefly alluded to
in the draft report. Three examples are given, One relates to an
organization whose members are all Bureau informants. The report
indicates a notional chapter of the W. E. B, DuBois Club was con<
sidered but never effected, A second type organization is described
as one with unsuspecting (non-informant) members, and in this
example the establishment of a Klan organization under the control
of a Bureau informant (the Confederate Knights of the Ku Idux Klan)

is mentioned, indicating the Bureau paid the informant's expenses in
setting up this 250-member group. The third exomple relates to an
organization which is wholly fictitious for the purpose of disseminating
propaganda. The Committee for Expansion of Socialist Thought in
America (CESTA) is described as such a group. CESTA attacked the
CPUSA from the arxist right for two years in approximately 1965-67.
Although the SSC draft is not severely critical of CESTA, it makes

ne effort to point out evidente indicating the operation was success-
ful, it being noted this information was available to it.

SYNOPSIS:

The SSC staff, as a result of suggestions made by Intelli-~
gence Division supervisors following review of the SSC draft report
on FBI Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros), agreed to delete
one-item entirely and seek a change in wording of the other item so
it might be declassified. The Bureau takes the position at this time
that change would be unacceptable to warrant declassification because.
of possible compromise of a sensitive technique with foreign intelli~ a
gence ramifications.

DETAILS;

A memorandum on 3/9/76 advised that as a result of the
review of the SSC draft report on FBI Counterintelligence Programs
(Cointelpros), it was determined that two items included in the draft
which were unclassified should be classified "Secret.""| At the con~
clusion of the review, a written statement was submitted to SSC staff
member Barbara Banoff, setting forth the two items that should be
classified "Secret" in order to protect foreign intelligence sources
and/or techniques.

Miss Banoff advised SA Don Ks Pettus on 3/15/76 that
the Committee has agreed to delete any reference in the report to
the item which set forth the proposal that a representative of the FBI
Laboratory sabotage a printing press imported from East Germany.
by the Communist Party, USA.

The second item which the review determined should be
classified appeared on page 78, paragraph 1, lines 6-8, and read as
follows: '", < < to having the FBI Lab forge an informant's report in
the target's handwriting, thus making it extremely difficult for him
to deny the accusation,***" Banoff advised on 3/15/76 that the staff,
after a review of this item, proposed that "forge" be changed to
"fake," noting that this is not the only instance in which a fake infor=
mant report has been submitted, Banoff indicated the SSC would like
to have a reply on 8/16/76 as to whether the recommended change
would be approved by the Bureau, She did indicate that if the recom-
mendation was accepted a letter would be submitted by the SSC to the
Bureau confirming the change. Supervisor David Ryan, on 3/15/76,
advised that changing the word "forge" to "fake'' would be inadequate
in that it could still compromise a technique which could cause
Communist Party members to conduct additional reviews of an
incident in 1965 when this technique was used in a successful
counterintelligence action with foreign intelligence ramifications.

This page was Captioned "Case Number 1L, Ku Klux

we, on one occasion, had used an informant to break away

from one Klan organization for the purpose of creating an

opposition Klan group which would cause dissension and hope-

fully neutralize Klan activities in the area. There were

no. specifics mentioned in this write-up nor did it indicate

the ‘state in which this occurred nor any time frame. At

jour suggestion, Mr. Kelley agreed that he would change this
ite-up to reflect that we did not instigate the creation

however, did utilize this group

after it was created through our informant. Additionally,

he agreed to change this write-up to reflect that although
there were a considerable number of charters issued for new
units, only a few actually came into being. The write-up

as it appears would not further identify any of our informants

On 3/8/76, Banoff telephonically requested SA Ryan to
review the original serials for the two items (100-3-104-34-1001 and
100~-3- 104-1492) to determine if they, infact, were classified, A
review of the files determined the first item had not been classified
and the second was classified "Confidential." Banoff was advised
these serials were originally intended to be internal documents and,
when reviewed for classification retroactively, the first was over-
looked and the second was misinterpreted as to degree of classification,
Banoff was advised that publication of this information at this time
could be reasonably expected to result in serious damage to the
national security as it could disclose intelligence sources and/or
methods, Banoff advised that she anticipated this information would
not be included in the published SSC report,

Item 1 above contains information received and reported
exclusively by our sensitive Solo informants and its publication could
cause speculation within the Communist Party as to their identities,
Item 2 relates to the capability of the FBI Laboratory in an area
with foreign intelligence ramifications, Publication of the second
item in the SSC report could cause Communist Party members to
conduct additional reviews of an incident in 1965 when this technique
was used in a successful counterintelligence action with foreign intel-
ligence ramifications, The original documents relating to these two
techniques have now been classified "Secret."

pirector-not-anpeer, as requested on an upcoming "Pace the Nation"
TV program. 7

On March 12th Joan Barone, Assistant Producer of “Face
the Nation,” Washington, D. C., contacted Deputy Assistant Director
Homer A. Boynton of my staff to request that the Director give
consideration to appearing on the “Face the Nation" program on
the Sunday after the release of the Senate Select Ci ttee report
on the Bureau. Miss Barone indicated that the report is scheduled
to be released at the end of March and, therefore, the appearance:
would be on Sunday, April 2nd, or if the report is delayed, Sunday,
April llth.

I feel that the Director should not appear at.this tine
on this program. It can be expected that the final report of the
Senate Select Committee will be highly critical of the Burea&, and
I do not feel that the Director, because of other heavy commitments,
will have the time to he adequately briefed to respond to the alle~
gations contained in the rt. In addition, it is felt that the
Director shovld not be stigmatized by close association. with the
alleged nistakes and improprieties of the past.

RECOMMENDATION

what the Director not accept the invitation to appear on
"Face the Nation” and Miss Barone be informed that the reason for
this is the Director is heavily committed for the next several
months. '.

This is to record for the file my review of
certain documents from Department files which Department

is furnishing copies of to the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities (SSC).

On 3/17/76, Mr, Steven Blackhurst, Assistant
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, brought to
my office several documents from Department files concerning
Martin Luther King, Jr., and related matters which SSC Staff
Member Michael Epstein had previously reviewed at the
Department and then requested delivery. Blackhurst asked
that I review the documents to see if the Bureau had any
objection to their delivery and to make any excisions which
the Bureau felt appropriate. After review, it was my
judgment that no problem was apparent except as relating
to one document, the New York report of SA Philip H, Sheridan
dated 7/12/63, "Communist Infiltration of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference; IS-C" (Bureau file
100-438794-21). I suggested that on page 4 in the following,

This memorandum reports the review by Special
Agent (SA) Andrew J. Duffin of that portion of the Senate
Select Committee (SSC) draft concerning the National
Security Agency (NSA) and the Watch List.

On 3/5/76, SA Duffin reviewed the portion of the 7
SSC draft report concerning NSA and the Watch List in the :
SSC space, The draft, 94 pages, doubled spaced, entitled
"National Security Agency Surveillance Affecting Americans"
was classified "Top Secret/Handle Via Comint Channels
Only". and was draft dated 2/26/76,

The review revealed that the vast majority of
the text concerned NSA and secondarily CIA and its
cooperation with and support of NSA functions and only
tlarginally dealt with the FBI, The references concerning
fhe FBI deal particularly with the Watch List and the FBI

Memorandum to Mr, T. W. Leavitt
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Additionally, on page 29, a paragraph contained
examples of names of individuals and organizations
submitted for inclusion on the Watch List by Secret Service
! and the FBI, Attributed to the FBI were Muhammed Ali,

Roy Innis and Eldridge Cleaver “as well as the Black

Student Unions at many colleges and universities.”

Mr. Schneitter was advised that it would be the FBI's

position that these names should not be set forth in the

| report for numerous reasons not the least of which would
be that they could ostensibly. lead to the revelation of
sensitive sources or methods on behalf of the intelligence

! community through subsequent Freedom of Information Act

| (FOIA) requests or law suits, He stated he appreciated

| the FBI's position; however, the decision as to the

| inclusion in the SSC's report was as yet undecided.

The original handwritten notes taken during the
course of this review are being maintained in the Senstudy
Project files.

On 3/8/76, Mr. John Wobensmith, NSA, telephon-
ically conferred with SA Duffin indicating that the SSC
draft concerning his agency had been reviewed numerous
times by NSA personnel and, in fact, by NSA's Director
and Deputy Director, both of whom passed on its contents
as to classification and accuracy. He noted that ultimately
when the report is published it will not be classified
and NSA has agreed to this as they have successfully
accomplished deletions which would necessitate classification,
He advised that the only item contained in the report
with which NSA was still concerned was the setting out
of actual identities of individuals and groups as contained
on the Watch List submitted by Secret Service and FBI.

Ce

John Crewdson, reporter for the "New York Times," contacted
Deputy Assistant Director Homer Boynton of my staff on March 9th to
advise that he was preparing a story which would allege that the FBI
had been penetrated by the KGB on three occasions since World War

| II. Fane
Crewdson stated that one of these penetrations was in “A
New York, one in Washington, and one in San Francisco. He related \

that his information concerning the San Francisco penetration was ~
quite incomplete and had to do with some FBI documents which were \
reportedly furnished to a member of the Soviet Consulate in

San Francisco and a member of the Consulate subsequently attempteg |
to sell these documents back to the Government. The New York 1a 1
involved an Agent in that office; however, Crewdson would provide

no additional details. He did state, however, that he was famili.

L with the story involving "Edie," a waitress in a restaurant next

the New York FBI Office who had had an affair with an Agent in they
New Yogk Office; however, Crewdson was also aware that this ate
was concluded with a determination that it was not a penetration
of the FBI by the XGB.

CORD!

Crewdson also advised that he had additional information

that an Agent in the Washington Field Office (whose name he did no

know) was involved with the KGB and that this Agent had obtained

~ some documents from the Washington Field Office and had furnished
them to the Soviets. The Bureau resolved this matter when it observed
the Agent making a telephone call from a telephone booth--supposedly
to a Soviet contact. The telephone booth beg was in Montgomer

identity is set forth. Both of these instances appear to be
related to COINTELPRO actions involving the two men, The
sortions of the report concerning the Black Extremist Program
land King were reviewed by Special Agent H. A, Newman,

Several errors were noted in the report, one being
improper attributions to Special Agent Rachner, which were
corrected, In discussion with Walter Ricks, SSC Staff Member,
it was pointed out that material contained on pages 49 and 50
concerning the FBI's role in audits done by IRS regarding
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) were not believed to

ov, be accurate, Ricks advised that he coyld not say positively
off atts that this information was obtained from FBI documents and,
cones pile? in fact, admitted that the language used appeared somewhat
we

d chet speculative and he would make an effort to change the report
an ee to put the FBI's role in proper perspective, Ricks stated
to see ! Ine would discuss this matter with other staff members and

BAe ges try to find the source of the conclusions and if the comments

ait The portion of the report reviewed by Bureau
foersonnet contained no recommendations by SSC. With the
exception of the above-cited information concerning SDS,
all material cited appears to have been documented and facts
as set forth stood on their own.

RECOMMENDATION :

Because of selection of the SSC of isolated instances
of questionable use of IRS tax information, no press response
be developed attempting to challenge this section of the
draft report, The primary thrust of the report is aimed at

IRS release of tax information without requiring sufficient
justification,

relating to the preparation of its draft report on "Cointelpro; The

FBI's Covert Action Programs against American Citizens." ,
aX
On 3/2-3/76 Supervisors Don K, Pettus, Arthur G, Pote SS
and David Ryan of the Intelligence Divis Divisi n visited SSC offices to ~
review the draft of thé Committee's report on Cointelpros for the need

being prepared detailing the results of this review. Information set.
forth here herein was furnished in personal conyérsations by SSC staff
member 1 Bafbara Banoff, Because it is not known what assumption

of confidentiality was intended by Banoff, it is being set forth herein

for background purposes to assist those ‘officials involved in matters
relating to the SSC.

On 3/2/76, in furnishing copies of the draft report to 9 _-”
Bureau representatives, Banoff stated "Try not to get upset abouk ~~
the inflammatory statements," On 3/3/76 Banoff commented that
this was the fifth draft of the SSC report on Cointelpros, indicating
disagreement Wi With many of the changes made. When one of the Bureau
representatives indicated to her that much of the language of the report

did not sound like her wording, she she indicated the report. had been sub-

and instructed her to take similar action to give it "punch" and, add
"color." She said Schwarz: had completely rewritten, himself, the
first two pages of the report and he had also eliminated from the

report "flatter" material inserted by Banoff.

It is noted the first two pages of the draft report contained
such statements as 'Cointelpro is the story of decent men who did
terrible things for what they saw as the greater good of the country, "
and", .. the techniques were adopted wholesale from wartime
intelligence."

Banoff also advised that after Schwarz. had rewritten
portions of the report, it had been read by Committee member

Senator Walter_E. Mondale, Mondale Had returned the report, instruc-_

ting some of the "editorializing" be eliminated,

On 3/2/76 Ryan was greeted by Schwarz. at the Committee
offices, Schwarz. queried as to Ryan's opinion of the draft report.
When Ryan indicated the report was based on selective documentation,
much taken out of context, Schwarz: responded, "Well, what did you
expect?"

-Banoff opined the draft. report.on.Cointelpro would. .
receive considerable additional editing by Schwarz, Minority Counsel
Curtis R._ Smothers, and by Committee members_before it was finally_
released for publication.” She also expressed the opinion it would be
‘shortened considerably from its preseni ‘pases (double spaced)

prior to its publication.

Dear Mike:

In recent days the Select Committee has submit-
ted portions of its report to the FBI for review to deter-
mine whether their publication might inadvertently reveal
classified information. This process is proceeding smooth-

cane ly, and I have advised you periodically of the results.

I want to assure you that the Select Committee
does not intend to publish any materials without prior
review by the FBI. The inclusion in the report of specific
references to, quotations from, or summaries of material
provided by the Bureau does not mean that the Committee
will inter ret clearance o the report by* 1é 5 Bureau asa

~addréional materials or _portions_ thei
appear inthe report are to be
or other public release, prior review by the FBI will be
sought.

Sincerely,

It seems clear that preliminary investigations will
constitute the bulk of such cases in terms of the ~
number.of cases, though probably not in terms of in-
vestigative effort expended. The -guideYines indicate
that preliminary investigations may -be ‘terminated at
any time by the Attorney General, his designee, or _
FBI Headquarters, “If no 90-day éxtensions are involved,

BACKGROUND CONCERNING THIS INQUIRY AND THIS QUESTION WAS IMMEDIATELY
RELAYED TO DIRECTOR KELLEY. ADVICE WAS RECEIVED FROM DIRECTOR
KELLEY THAT HE HAD JUST TALKED WITH INSPECTOR BOYNTON, EXTERNAL
AFFAIRS, CONCERNING SIMILAR INQUIRY RECEIVED FROM CREWDSON OF THE NEW
YORK TIMES AND DIRECTOR ASKED THAT SIMILAR RESPONSE AS GIVEN TO
CREWDSON BE FURNISHED TO DILLON. AFTER DISCUSSING THIS WITH
INSPECTOR BOYNTON, ASAC BARGER FURNISHED THE FoLLyf tne TO PATRICK
DILLON IN RESPONSE TO HIS INQUIRY, “THE FBI WAS AWARE OF ATTEMPTS

TO INFILTRATE THE BUREAU IN RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER, WE HAVE
CONDUCTED EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATIONS AND THOSE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE
NOT DISCLOSED EVIDENCE OF ANY SUCCESSFUL RECRUITING OR OPERATION OF
AN EMPLOYEE OF THE FBI BY ANY FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.”

IN RESPONSE TO SD INQUIRY, DILLON ADVISED THAT HIS INQUIRY WAS
BASED ON INFORMATION HE HAD RECEIVED FROM A VERY RELIABLE SOURCE
WHICH HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY, THAT A FORMER AGENT IN WAHSINGTON
SOMETIME AFTER NINETEEN SIXTY HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED AS POSSIBLY
BEING RECRUITED BY THE KGB. THE AGENT APPARENTLY HAD AMASSED A
SIZEABLE DEBT AND HAD DEFINITELY BEEN CONTACTED BY THE KGB. FURTHER
THAT BALTIMORE UNDERCOVER AGENTS HAD HIM UNDER SURVEILLANCE WHEN HE

ONCE AND THEN WAITED FOR A CALL BACK. AFTER A LENGTHY CONVERSATION,
THE AGENT WAS TAKEN TO THE FBI WHERE HE WAS GIVEN A POLYGRAPH WHICH
WAS INCONCLUSIVE AND HE WAS ALLOWED TO RESIGN.

DILLON SAID THAT THERE WAS ALLEGEDLY ANOTHER INCIDENT WHICH
TOOK PLACE IN NEW YORK, BUT HE DID NOT HAVE ANY DETAILS ON IT.

SD UNION CARRIED A FRONT PAGE ARTICLE IN THE MARCH TEN INSTANT

| 1946-1963.

This letter is to confirm that John Elliff was assured by
Mr. Shackleford that the FBI has no objection on security
_ grounds to the publication of this report. If any changes
are made in the substance of this portion of the report,
it will be resubmitted prior to publication.

At approximately 5:00 p.m. on 3-8-76, John Ellift
Domestic Task Force Director of the Senate Select Committee, advised
Inspector John B. Hotis that the final report released earlier oe

afternoon by the Senate Select Committee contained inrmation that
was not cleared by the Bureau for publical ion. He said that £ Volume 2,

‘Page 270, of the hearings on the Huston Plan set forth the names of
individuals and organizations that were the subjects of 13 telephone
surveillances and one microphone surveillance. The report also included
memoranda containing the names or initials of FBI personnel who had
reviewed or approved the surveillances. Among the subjects identified
were the Black Panther Party, the CPUSA, the Jewish Defense Meiamsinat
Huey Newton, and two women who were active i in the New Left. ~

Elliff said he had given explicit instructions that this S
information was to be excised before publication and did not know. why

it: was included in the final report. He said that 30 copies of the report
had already been distributed to members of the press, and it was-not, _
likely they could be recalled. He also felt that any attempt to have .
the documents returned would draw the press's attention to the problem.
Elliff said he regretted the oversight but did not think there was anything
irther that could be done about the disclosures.

Re: SENSTUDY

ADDENDUM BY LEGAL COUNSEL, 3/9/76, JAM:mfd

Inspector Hotis advised me of the above information immediately
after receiving it from John Elliff.a I instructed him to advise the
Intelligence Division while I alerted Mr. Adams to the problem. Mr. Adams
instructed that copies of the materials released by the Committee should
be made available to the Intelligence Division as soon as possible in order
that they could be reviewed to determine whether any other materials
were improperly included. I instructed SA John Dennis Miller to
obtain additional copies of the materials and provide them to the Intelligence
Division on the evening of March 8, 1976, and he did so. I advised
Assistant Director Leavitt of Mr. Adams’ instructions and requested him
to have the materials reviewed appropriately. :

Reference is made to memorandum Mr. F. J. Cassidy ‘Eo if

Mr. Leavitt dated 3/9/76, which outlined various problems and
apparent slanted writing in the Senate Select Committee's
COINTELPRO report.

On 3/4/76, during a discussion concerning another
matter, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division mentioned to Domestic
Task Force Director John T. Elliff that there were apparent <a
problems regarding that Committee's report on COINTELPRO. It nt
was pointed out that the Bureau representatives who had reviewed_-
the report felt there were statements taken out of context and
that in general it was a highly critical report of this Bureau.

ferier stated that a decision had been made by F. A. O. Schwartz,

VE

Chief Counsel, and Curtis Smothers, Minority Counsel, that they
would highlight the actions taken in COINTELPRO and not describe
or characterize the victims or objects of comer. activities.
They felt that it was Be tig that "Ce pps scree WE

It was pointed out to EL that in order to geta

true picture of the activities in COINTELPRO if*Was “Tess *tan
fair to isolate the acts from the context in which the activi-
ties were committed. He reiterated this was a decision of
Smothers and Schwartz and that there was no question in his
mind that this was a report that "zapped" the Bureau. He
indicated he would bring the observations of the Agents that
had reviewed the report and the observations of SA Daly to the
attention of his superiors. f

slowly intensifying confrontation between the Federal
Governmert and a minimum of 3,000 poor people. Tactics
will mainly be sit-ins and marches which will be put into ]
play over a period of weeks and not all at once. As of i
» April 22, 1968, Dr. King and up to 100 other civil rights

-and Negro community leaders from around the country will start
visiting congressional leaders, heads of Government departments
and agencies,"presenting to them the demands of the campaign and

- asking them to take action. Several days later, after nothing
has been done, they will probably pick one office and refuse to
leave. When they are arrested, the poor people across the country
will be mobilized and begin to come in caravans."

|

i The article indicated that well before the April 22nd
| starting date, work was expected to start on a "New City of
Hope" with tents or temporary buildings set up on a 30 acre
site and supplied with electricity, sewer lines, an outdoor
theater, kitchens and parking.

| The article indicated: that ie still Y noting To done
| by the Federal Government, then acts of "moral disobedience"
will begin.

The "People's World" issue of March 23, 1968, carried
Le an article which indicated that Dr. King spoke before 150
Negro church leaders at the Elks Club on Central Avenue, Los
Angeles, California on March 16, 1968. Dr. King urged the
ministers to begin now to organize for mass outpourings of i
people from their congregations to join the demonstration.

-The "People's torld" is a West Coast communist
newspaper which is published weekly in San Francisco, |
California.

The same issue of the "People's World" also carried . |
an article which indicated that the massive demonstration in |
Washington beginning on April 22, 1968, will be a "black-brown i
thing". This was disclosed at the California Democratic Council i
Convention which was held in Anaheim, California on ithe weekend of
March 16 - 17, 1968, by Dr. Martin Luther King, the /initiator i

and described the caller as one “deeply concerned with the
. under privileged group of humanity," It was mentioned to

DITTO the caller did not want to be publicly identified

as it could possibly render harm to his business and bring

about retalitory action from the white extremists involv~

ing possible physical harm to his wife and family.

It was at this point that DITTO volunteered the
information set out in instant LH. He offered to furnish
the caller with further information regarding Washington
Spring Project after his meeting with KING,

Prior to terminating the interview, it was
established that DITTO would be telephonically contacted
by the caller following his scheduled conference with KING
in Detroit, It is the opinion of the contacting Agent
that if KING actually comes to Detroit on 4/4/68, that
this return telephonic recontact with DITTO would be productive
and pertinent data regarding Washington Spring Project
could be obtained from him,

The LEM is classified confidential so as not to
disclose the use of this technique from which further valuable
information could be obtained.

Capitol the first week of April, 1968, in as effort to pressure
Congress into passing legislation favorab to the Negro. .

On March 5, 1968, GOLDEN ASRORINKS,, Field Secretary,
SCLC, was interviewed by Agent of the FBI at his residence
122 West Peterson Street, Edenton, North Carolina. FRINKS said~
that he is pleased with the progress that Congress is making

even if legislation is passed, this will not change SCIC's . |
plans for a march on Washington, D. C. FRINKS pointed out that
Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING has not spelled out his demands as yet
and that they will include much more than just a housing law.

are assured a minimum income which would be paid by the Federal
government. His concept of this plan would be that the number

of days per year an individual is employed by private’ industry
would be subtracted from the total in the year and then the i
government would pay the balance. He said that it would be the a
government's responsibility to provide the work they wish these i{
individuals to do, even if it be only menial labor. He said that Se
it would also be the government's responsibility to enforce this /
plan to insure that the persons are actually doing the work.

With regard to the march, he said that he has 21 paid
employees working for him throughout the State of North Carolina,
He said that these individuals are not being paid a salary but
subsistence only. He said that these people were unemployed

ENCLOSURE



L RE; WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT 7 : an

: FRINKS said that these 21 persons are recruiting others
to go to Washington, D. C., for the march and act as squad ce
leaders, guides, etc. for the masses who will follow, He said

\ that his paid employees have a goal of 200 such persons and
that 155 have already been recruited, After the recruitment

drive is complete, only a Tév he Di will remain on the

payroll, : :

FRINKS said that he and‘his group of about 200 will
leave North Carolina on April 15 or 16, with a planned arrival |.
in Washington, D. C., on April 22, 1968. Concerning transportation,
he said that the means of transportation has not yet been worked
out. He said he has given consideration to buying old busses
or cars, but the busses especially do not seem to be available.
FRINKS said there has been a suggestion to drive to a distance
of 100 miles south of Washington and then walk the rest of the
way. There has also been the suggestion to walk the entire way.
FRINKS said he personally.prefers to go by bus or car if possible,
stopping in the small towns en route. He hopes to set up tents
at night along the way. He mentioned the town of Suffolk,
Virginia, as a possible first night stop. He commented that he

“also hopes to set up tents in Washington, but he feels that they
will be prohibited from doing this.

A Upon arrival at Washington, D. C., FRINKS believes that
Dr, KING will be there to meet them. Shortly after their
arrival, he believes that KING will make his demands and then
call all Negroes to Washington who have grievances. The hard
core group of squad leaders and guides will be stationed at
the entrances to the city and at the Federal buildings and
direct each incoming group to the office building that should
best be able to handle their particular grievance. FRINKS
estimated that the demonstrations in Washington will last about
three weeks. _ i -_

FRINKS advised that he and Dr. KING are very much
«concerned about STOKLEY CARMICHAEL and the Student Nonviolent
’ a Coordinating Committee (SNCC) trying to interfere cr take over
a once the Negroes are in Washington. He said CARMICHAEL's
presence represents violence and the communist influence in the
civil rights movement. He said Dr. KING spoke with CARMICHAEL
during the last week in February and has a promise from him that
he will not interfere with the plans of SCLC. FRINKS advised
\ that KING plans additional talks with CARMICHAEL. FRINKS said
if he does come, "we will bust his head."

FRINKS said that his headquarters for this march is at -~
his residence or at his office located above the Credit
Union Building, 405 Broad Street, Edenton, North Carolina.

: He pointed out that he is still working for Dr.
REGINALD HAWKINS in support of his campaign for governor.
He said that he is finishing a seven weeks leave of absence,

but believes that this will be extended for an additional seven
weeks, He said the campaign is badly in need of money; however, |
there are many more supporters than originally expected. He™
mentioned that his telephone bill for his residence telephone
was over $1,000, and that it has been disconnected.

It was observed that FRINKS was driving a a blue
recent model Dodge, four-door, bearing 1968 North Carolina

reads, " HAWKINS FOR GOVERNOR, Candidate for Hope and Progress."

SECURITY MATTER ~ SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN
LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

On 2/6/68 Mrs, Dorothe Matlack, Office of the He
Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of suset
the Army, advised that on 2/5/68 Major General Roland del Mar
(U.S. Army, retired), who resides at 520 N Street, Southwest,
Apartment 8-231, Washington, D.C., und whose telephone number
is 554-7473, fvsnished the following information: :

General del Mar said that he has been furnished

~
B88 Fantormation by a professional associate, whom he described
8 a8 aas a "friendly enemy" and with whom he maintains an armed
$$ 98 truce. This associate, whom the General declined to iden-
a: B5 taty except to indicate that he is a fellow member of the
gi &8 Council on Foreign Relations Study Group on U.S, Policy in
S's 9 the Caribbean, has informed the General that when Martin
§8 83 luther King leads the April march in Washington, he plans to
Secs rally on the steps of the U.S, Supreme Court under the "Equal
8$99 Justice for All" engraving. According to General del Mar's
a § § source, there is a law which forbids this; therefore, King's
8 sg group hopes to be arrested. iA & Q
g 2 eee
& sf The source advised that at the rally King will be
&. § making demands for legislative action, giving Congress one
& 2S week to pass certain legislation. The source quoted King as
® § saying that, “The Negroes are tired of Congress resting on
fe sgits dignity." According to the source, if the demands of
x King's group are not satisfied within one week, they plan to
. 3 ‘burn Washington." The source further said that King has not
S23 really felt that he-wanted to go along with H."Rap" Brown but
“&gG that if King does not get his legislative demands in April,
Sse he intends to join forces with those of Brown for all-out
sis -violence.in the United States.

PARK ELWOOD, Chief of Police, Ada, Ohio, advised
SA STEPHEN FUNDERBURK on 1/12/68, that he learned that
Dr. JAMES UDY, Ohio Northern University, Ada, Ohio,
who was in charge of the program featuring Rev. MARTIN LUTHER
KING at Ohio Northern University, chartered a plane from Lima,
Ohio, to pick up Rev. KING at Cleveland, Ohio, at 7:30 AM,
1/11/68. Rev. KING then gave his talk at Ohio Northern
University from approximately 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, at the
University gym, which was attended by 2200 people plus 500 more
who listened over the public address system at the University
Auditorium. Rev. KING in his talk discussed poverty, housing
for Negroes, Negro unemployment, rat control, etc.; KING
suggested and condoned civil disobedience to bring about
better conditions for Negroes. KING made reference to a recent
statement of ADAM CLAYTON POWELL that Rev. KING advocated
violence at this time and KING denied that this was so, as he
does not condone violence in the civil rights movement.

Further along in his talk Rev. KING mentioned that

"his group Was planning massive demonstrations in Washington,

D. C., and five other major cities, including Cleveland, in
the Spring and Summer of 1968, to get action to aid Negroes
in the United States; KING gave no details of this project.

According to Chief ELWOOD, there were no problems,
incidents, ete. in connection with Rev. KING's visit to
Ada, Ohio, and KING departed that city during the early
afternoon of 1/11/68, for Cleveland, Ohio, and New York City.

Gleveland sources could not furnish any. information
that Rev. KING spent any time in the Cleveland area on either

“L/1O or 11/68, nor have they seen any indication that there

has. been any planning or activity in Cleveland on Rev. KING's

SECURITY MATTER - C

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (chaired by Senator John L.
McClellan) which currently is conducting the hearings concerning riots
and civil disorders, has requested information concerning the demon-
stration being planned by Martin Luther King, Jr., in Washington this -
spring. King has publicly stated that he intends to conduct massive
civil disobedience in Washington this year unless specific demands

for congressional action to solve the problems of poor Negroes are met.

Enclosed is a brief summary of pertinent information
§ concerning King’s plans for this event. The information contained
nereet is of a public source nature. ue

in addition to furnishing the enclosed write-up » to
3 O'Donnell, it is felt we should keep the leadership in the House of

* concerning these demonstrations insofar as that they might affect
the Congress. Hence, it is believed a copy of the enclosed write-up
should be furnished to Speaker of the House McCormack and Senate
% Majority Leader Mansfield for their information. :

Hon. resentative Carl B. Albert

Washington, DC.

Dear Representative Albert:

I am enclosing for your consideration a compendium of reactions.
such as could logically be triggered in the minds of many of our ~
citizenry across America upon being apprised through the news media
of what transpired during the course of a House subcommittee proceedin,
on 2/25/76 in which recommendations were made that several witnesses
be cited for contempt of Congress. The witnesses were all presumably
honorable and civic minded public servants employed past or present in
intelligence operations who, on orders from highly placed superiors
stemming from expressed wishes of the President, declined to produce -
documents or to testify about a sensitive government intelligence
program.

It is sincerely believed that the views expressed are not greatly]
unlike those likely to be found in many quarters were there to be a ~
taking of the pulse of public opinion on the matter. Brevity has been
sacrificed in order:'to bring out a sampling of a number of trends of
thought that could flow from an examination of the facts reported in
this case.

The views set forth in the attachment establish a basis for the
appeal in the concluding paragraph, which is highlighted by being
repeated herewith 3

In the interests of justice and good government, it is hoped that
those who are responsible for voting on the contempt citations recommen
by the subcommittee referred to herein, including members of that :
subcommittee, will take sufficient time to so examine and analyze all
pertinent facets of this situation as to assure final action that will

inpertiality, fairness, and a considered perspective on the real inten
of the Founding Fathers when they wrote our beloved Constitutions

REFLECTIONS ON REPORTED PROCEZDINGS OF A HOUSS SUBCOMMITTER
LEADING TO RNCOMMNDATIONS ON 2/25/76 OF CONTEMPT CIDATIONS,
AND ENUMERATION OF SEVERAL LIKELY ReACTIONS THAT COULD BE

S@IRRED UP IN TH MINDS OF PERSONS COGNIZANT OF THE EPISODE.

A person presumed to be sincerely interested in fostering
respect for law and order and for the wisdom embodied in our *
constitutional form of government, might be hard pressed, either
through lucky inadvertance or deliberate design, to put together
in a single paragraph, more words to defeat the above—outlined
purpose than may be found in the following example:

" The Attorney General is without any authority. It is the
most outrageous assumption, the most arrogant display by the
Attorney General I have ever seen. Some damn two-bit appointee
of the Fresident is not the law-making body of this coumtry.”

If the account published on page 12 of the New York Times of
2/26/76 is an accurate reflection of what transpired during hearings
held by the Government Information and Individual Rights Subcommittee
of the House of. Congress on 2/25/76, the above is but one of the
remarks attributed to a member of that subcommittee, reportedly
made in the course of attempts to extract information about the
government's interception of telegraph and Telex messages, that
give rise to natural questions about the dignity, propriety and
justification for such a bumptious approach to such a serious
subject matter.

fo begin with, one might wonder to whom the author of the quoted
paragraph, Representative John B. Moss, was really addressing his
somewhat less than tactfully phrased object lesson on the apportionme:
of powers in our federal system of government.

One might find it difficult to believe that any of the witnesses
reportedly confronted that day, F.BoI. Agents, a former F.BsI. Agent
and an employee of the National Security Agency, even by the vaguest
hint or most facetious remark, could have proffered the suggestion
that the Attorney General ( or any appointee of the President )
constitutes “the law~ making body of this country. " Witnesses such
as these are not noted for flippancy when under questioning by duly
consvituted authority, and are not likely to be complete ignoramuses
regarding the basic structure of our government. They can be assumed
to have a better than grammar school level understanding of the
systez so wisely established by the Founding Fathers, with beautifull:
designed separation of powers. between three branches, legislative,
executive and judicial, amd they can likewise be assumed to have a
general awareness of the conga a1 powers alloted to each of

~#sson, then, was likely lost on, if indeed intended for
mnesses, from whom the subcommittee was attempting to extract
on against instructions issued by the Attorney General and/or

Secretary of Defense in the wake of the expressed wishes of
ident. :

One might. logically, then, turn to wondering if perhaps the object
lesson was not really directed at President Ford and Attorney General
Edward Ho Levi, lest either somehow be lacking in knowledgeability as ~
to what does constitute " the law-making body of this country." After
all, the legislator who brought up the lesson material reportedly
did meke the assertion : " The real contempt here has been committed
by the Attorney General of the United States and the President of the
United Statess”

Interestingly enough, after thus having had the finger placed on
where the alleged blame truly lies, the subcommittee, with commendable
promptness as @ noteworthy virtue, recommended contempt citations
for the witnesses who presumably were conveniently close at hand. Thus
was the stage set for proposed martyrdom, should they fail. to disobey
their superiors, of the emissaries,the messengers bearing the offendin,
messages, while the fingered true culprits , afar from Garcia im the
relative seclusion of executive heirarehy, remain momentarily free
except as targets of name calling.

“The witnesses were pressured as to whether they had a constitutio:
al basis for refusing to produce the documents or ansyer the questions
states the news article.

Now, one might muse, this Constitution to which the subcommittee
alludes, is a little bit vague about some things, very clear about
otherse

For one thing, it clearly does not designate the Attorney General
as the law-making body. The Congressman's basic contention on that ~
score is incontestably correct!

How, the same Constitution that says: " All legislative powers
herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States
which shall consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives ",
also states, while speaking of the President: " ~» he shall take care
the laws be faithfully executed and shall Commission all the
ers of the United States."

Characteristically, this Constitution, which does not spell out
ing in fine detail, did not describe by title the various

rs to be appointed by the President. Yet it would be less than
prudent to contend that the authors did not intend the President to
appol = an officer to assist him in fulfilling his stipulated responsi
ility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

Since the holder of the title Attorney General, whose office
was ereated September 23,1789, has, from earliest times in our
uutionally~based government, been generally recognized as
est designated legal executive officer in the land, it
“2 seem to be now a little late to contest in unceremonious
circumstances, the validity of this well~established custom having
its beginnings in our country's original cabinet membership.

The spectacle of a member of our country's law-making body
loudly declaring that "The Attorney General is without power" might,
in itself, be sufficient basis for the generation of curiosity
as to the degree of consistancy maintained by the author of this
rather startling new doctrine, when engaged in referring to power
as it applies to a cabinet officer, and when engaged in referring
%o power as it applies ( even by inference) to the office held by

In fairness, some might be heard calling, we must assume that it
was an inadvertant mistake. - ~- no, rather, a deliberate exaggeration
for the sake of emphasis! 7 7

But alas! That is not the end of it! There are others who might
be responding along lines such as those that follows

To refer to the Attorney General disdainfully as " some damn
two-bit appointee of the President", a characterization made even
more dramatic when coming from a Federal law-maker, might rightfully
be considered as an indulgence in rhetoric hardly appropriate to
the occasion, much less suitable at any time, and as certainly
hardly déstined to inspire respect for duly constituted authority
or confidence in these holding high office in the Federal Government.
At a time when lawlessness and disrespect for authority ravage our

of another are not likely to be helpful.

In publicly charging the Attorney General with arrogance, a lew-
maker raises the question as. to the applicability of the very same
term to his own conduct in so doings

This Attorney General was clearly acting on the expressed wishes
of the President ( assuming the New York Times account correct)>
President Ford had already made it known in an earlier expression of
his ews, that he believes the public interest requires the records
sought not be disclosed to the committee.

fhis particular President, unlike many elected Presidents who
preceeded him, happens to be in office because of the esteem in which
he wes held by fellow members of Congress who put him there. Because of
his heavy, and only recently concluded backréund in the legislative
branch of the government, here is a President who is one least likely
to be unmindful of or callous about the rightful concerns of Congress,
even as he goes about the exercise of his new-found duties in another
branch of our same governments i

That the President's opinion on this highly important matter should
be afforded courteous consideration seems self evident. Were such
needed, lending additional support than normal for the sanity and

REFLECTIONS ON EPISODE 2/25/76

articular time, is the circumstance that as one running
e, he is unlikely to be desirous of creating a viable
issue arising out of charges of excessive use of executive

That all of our nation's defense secrets should, one ‘by one, beilai
bare to inquiring congressmen without grave reason can hardly find
justification in any wording to be found in the Constitution,

There are few who would seriously contend that throughout
congressional investigations conducted during the past year
related to the nation's intelligence community, outstanding skill
and wisdom have unerringly been exercised in the handling, protection
of, asd safekeeping of all the vital defense information that came
under the purview of the investigators. At this very moment, Congres
is engaged in efforts to uncover as yet unknown particulars concernin,
leaks and improper disclosures of information that have resulted in
damage to the nation's defense posture.

That some matters are of such a nature that they should rightfull
be regarded as, and properly handled as secret, is specifically
instructed in the Constitution in the phrase :'" Hach House shall
keep a Journal of the Proceedings and from time to time publish the
same, excepting such parts as may in their Judgement require secrecy

Having thus established the propriety of secrecy being afforded
certain appropriate natters coming within the cognizance of one brani
of the government, the Founding Fathers, though not spelling it. out
in the Constitution, can be assumed to have expected that good
judgement would likewise be exercised by officials in the other
branches of the government in the prudent safeguarding of secret
information coming within their purview.

The word “secrecy” has come on hard times. In the hands of some
it hes become a nasty word.

Perhaps it is not insignificant to note here, in passing, that
the comotations of " duplicity ", "deceit", or "coverup", given
too frequently these days to the word "secrecy" ( particularly
vlied to sensitive government operations), as if such should
w be accepted as the basic part of the definition of the word,
not distinctions that seemed of great concern to the authors of
Censtitution. It does not follow that they were accordingly
men, unaware of the frailties and connivings to be expected of
eubers of society, or that, because techniques have become
h more sophisticated, their understanding of the word is no

To recognize, the unpleasant fact that there exists always the
possibility of a few miscreants lurking in government who would
hide behind the protective cover of the stamp of secrecy to cover
their mistakes, is hardly sufficient reason to obliterate secrecy,
where such is necessary to our survival in a world in which we are
surrounded by forces of hostility and by those who would not be un—
happy over our downfall. F



HW 55166 DocId:32989587 Page 189

=~5-

Unceasing efforts can and should be made to uncover and unseat
the miscreants, through prudent means, leaving the nation's secrets
entact in the process. The old definition of the word secret needs
no 2iverations

Surely the thinking American public expects a strong and effective
gence gathering capability. Surely that same public recognizes
the ascessity for lucid and reasonable legislative guidelines to :
hels sssure that capability.

Now, one might be inclined to inquire, just what is the real
purpose, shorn.of all trappings, behind this Subcommittee's
tenacious desire to obtain full information about the government's
Telex and teletype interception project?

Could it be the uncovering of miscreants ? This would be one of
the functions of the legislative oversight process. But surely, in
view of the President's stand, there must be something beyond this
to warrant the making of a public issue such as we see heree

On the other hand; one can assume that Congress has quite enough
on its hands as an oversight organization, not to be seriously
considering moving permanently into the field of physically operating
the intelligence community, assuming its day to day functions of
collecting, assimilating, digesting, analyzing, and appropriately
disseminating intelligence data.

No, there certainly must be some other basis for insistance
on the acquisition of the information and documents sought, and 7
the resultant responsibility that automatically flows with them
for assuring their ppoper storage and safekeeping.

Of one thing we may be certain! Our Constitution says nothing
about the right of the public to know everything.

Unfortunately for the security of the nation, there has been
considerable undue acquiescense about dreadful recently popularized
distortions of the real meaning of some of the freedoms guaranteed
in the Constitution. Not the least of these distortions, perhaps,
are popular misconcepts about the intent of the so-called "freedom
of speech" and "freedom of the press" clause, that have been foisted
on a submissive public. An unwholesome aura of sanctity that has
been placed on perverted definitions of these freedoms has provided
cover for disclosure of state secrets and vital intelligence data
that never should have been made known to " the public”, Realisticall,
"toe public" means not only the enlightened citizenry of this country
(2s some would like us to believe), but in addition every unenlighten
eccentric, every ideological extremist, every scheming potential’
eneny, in every nut house, every subversive clubhouse, every espionag:
center on five continents and on the islands and waters set between.

There is a sensation value, of but a temporary nature, inherent
in the disclosure of intelligence operatetions data. Surely the
polivical or other gain achievable through taking advantage of that
value cannot be considered a legitimate goal in the absence of an
objective weighing of the goal against the potential loss of
intelligence capacity. :



Poe . ‘a Gm

a. , o
eran ever @ goals of the Subcommittee*in this episode, we
confidence that they are not for political advantage or

self interest.

rtunately, Congress seems to be operating in this area under
the same difficulties as the intelligence community it is
ting, without clearly defined guidelines as to its functions
esponsibilities, and commitments to the protection of vital
informations

Ho one is, nor is expected to be expert in all matters. Election
from one's home district to the office of congressman, in itself, by
no means qualifies one as an instant expert on matters of national
defense and international intrigue.

The President, as the nation's officer-in-charge of the nation's
intelligence-gathering community, on the other hand, does have
instant. access to whatever vital experience resides within, or
whatever significant information is developed by that community.

At his fingertips are the best qualified experts in the nation on
intelligence matters. His knowledgeability about the sensitivity

of an ongoing intelligence operation, by the very nature of things,
can be presumed to be of a higher degree than that of the average
congressman. Axiomatically, his duty to assure protection to areas
where secrecy is vital, is greater in magnitude and awsomeness than
that of other office holders.

The Attorney General has been called arrogant. Was his arrogance
to be found in his compliance with the expressed wishes of his
superior, the highest executive officer in the land? If it were for
some completely different behavior that the Attorney General was
thus categorized, would it not be well to have this made known on
the public record,along with other details that have been made known
through the press?

Are the President and the Attorney General really guilty of
contempt, as claimed, or is this but a loose figure of speech?

It was not by any loose figure of speech that recommendations
were handed up that witnesses before the Subcommittee be cited for
contempt.

Zt seems reasonable to envisage a viewing by the general public
the punitive action recommended by this subcommittee, as reaction
iff. A possible miff over lack of success through immediate vic
+ could be looked upon as being, in essence, a vaguely—defined
s yet dimutive battle of wills between a legislative subcommitte

oranch power struggle who happened to get in the way of the

As to the criminality of their behavior, how many objective observer:
of news accounts thus far available, are likely, on that information
to believe these witnesses to’ be criminally motivated or of
comptenptuous dispisition toward lawful authority, simply because,
in this controversial situation, they have seen fit to obey superiors
who happen to be top-level government officers?

ao There has be&Wn no issue raised here s@ the civic-mindedness,
* dedication to public service, patriotism, or loyaity to their oaths
of office on the part of any of these men. :

Hopefully for the safety of our citizenry, the hard-earned
image of the average FBI Agent as a trustworthy and dedicated
ec servant, has not been as greatly harmed by the massive
of one-sided adverse criticism leveled at the FBI as their
ectors, with all of their distortions, exaggerations, and
sponsible behavior, would have wished.

It is not inconceiveable that the net result of a decision by
Gongress to approve contempt citations against these witnesses,
might be not so much in any damage done to these few individuals,
as in the possible cheapening of the value of the process, through
undesirable dilution in the minds of a discerning public of the
gravity of the offense of being held in contempt of Congress.

No proper judgement can be made of the rightness or wrongness
of the actions of any persons involved in a situation such as the

Church to Honorable Clarence M,. Kelley, Director, Federal
Bureau of Inveatigation, dated February 20, 1976, which
requested the Attorney General's concurrence in the FBI's
reinstitution of the destruction of certain FBI documents

| By letter to the Director of the PBI dated January 37,
1975, from Senate Majority Leader Hike Mansfield and Minority
Leader Hugh Scott, the FBI was advised of the U. §. Senate's
4dntended investigation and study of intelligence activities by
the FBI and other Government agencies. ‘fhe scope of this in~-
vestigation and study vas described in Senate Pesolution 21 of
the 94th Congress.

| fhe aforementioned letter specifically requested the

FBI not destroy or otherwise dispose of any records or documents
which might have a bearing on the subjects under investigation or

h 21. That Section of the Resolution deseribed the Senate’a exten-
sive interest in the domestic intelligence as well as foreign
counterintelligence, activities of Executive Branch agencies,

P- including the FBI.

In accommodation of that request, Director Kelley
inmediately issued instructions to all offices and divisions of
the FEI establishing a moratorium on the destruction of ali records
of whatever description. In retrospect, the FBI now feels that the

The Select Committee deeply appreciates you

has been costly and has produced substantial administra-
tive burdens.

Therefore, the Select Committee would raise no
objection to the resumption of destruction of certain
records which would have no relationship whatsoever to the
matters specified in S. Res. 21. We are concerned, how-
ever, that resumption of routine destruction in accordance
with your established Records Retention Plan may result in

On February 13, 1976, a conference was held in Kansas >
City attended by the Director, 8 SACs and 2 representatives from
the External Affairs Division. The purpose of the conference was
to review ideas and procedures used by the field in promoting the ~
best interests of the Bureau through local media.

Tt

ye

It was the general feeling of the SACs that one’of the \g
most difficult problems in responding to criticism of the Bureau
relates to the reported abuses regarding the FBI's activities
-against Dr. Martin Luther King. The SACs felt that if an
appropriate answer could be prepared by FBIHQ they would be in
a better position to counter such criticism. While it was
explained that the testimony of Deputy Associate Director James
Adams was the best materidl available to respond to the
Martin Luther King criticism, the SACs felt that the Bureau should
have a more succinct and definitive answer.

The Director concurred with the observations of the
