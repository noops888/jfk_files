PURPOSE:

This is to report the review by Intelligence Division (INTD)

representatives of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) draft report on

our discontinued Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros) and to

recommend our comments relating to the report, as furnished on

3/3/76 to the SSC staff, be furnished to the Attorney General for

possible referral by him to the Committee and/or the White House.

SYNOPSIS:

DA13 41=8-00

On 3/2-3/76 INTD Supervisors Don K. Pettus, Arthu

Pote and David Ryan reviewed the 133-page (double spaced) SSC draft

report dated 2/24/76, entitled "Cointelpro: The FBI's Covert Action

7

Programs against American Citizens," at SSC offices for the need

for classification. Two items appearing in the report requiring

classification of "Secret" or higher were identified to the SSC and

will be outlined separately. Upon completion of the review of the

report, the FBI representatives submitted to the SSC staff a brief

statement indicating that because the report was based upon selec-

tive documentation, contained conclusions phrased in a subjective

and condemnatory manner, and because the reviewers were denied

access to depositions and other documentation referred to in the draft,

it was felt no purpose would be served in attempting to refute or con-

tradict conclusions by the draft's authors, and therefore no comment

would be made. Further, the statement indicated a concern that

inadequate consideration was given to the rights of privacy of those

mentioned directly or indirectly in the draft report. The draft, on

its first page, alleges "Cointelpro is the story of decent men who did

terrible things for what they saw as the greater good of the country"

and later editorializes "the only conclusion that can be drawn from

the cases is that the Bureau considered the First Amendment a danger

to the country, " and these conclusions characterize the overall tenor

of the draft.

Numerous selective quotes are incorporated in the

report from documents and depositions, some of which are obviously

out of context. Former Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan

is cited, as are former Assistant Director Charles D. Brennan and

Section Chief George C. Moore of the INTD. Also, INTD supervisors

Thomas J. Deakin, Russell Horner (retired) and David Ryan are cited

extensively. The report concludes Cointelpros became more damag-

ing to constitutional rights as they progressed, with the latter two

programs targeting Black Nationalists and New Left, the most

offensive. Selective, incomplete summaries of numerous Cointelpro

actions are cited, usually without characterizing the subversive or

extremist nature of the targets or detailing the true objective of the

FBI. While the report indicates the FBI notified the Executive and

Legislative Branches regarding the existence of the Cointelpros, it

downplays this effort by indicating the notification was vague and

incomplete and by citing iwo former Attorneys General alleged

ignorance of the programs. An eifort is made to discredit the review

of the Department (Petersen Committee of the Criminal Division) and

Civil Rights Division review of Cointelpros as incomplete.

ACTION:

That the attached letter enclosing a memorandum setting

forth the comments of the Special Agents who reviewed the draft

report be forwarded to the Attorney General for his information and

for possible referral to the SSC and/or the White House.

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

DETAILS:

On 3/2-3/76, Intelligence Division Supervisors Don K.

Pettus, Arthur G. Pote and David Ryan visited the SSC offices at the

Dirksen Office Building to review the 133-page (double spaced)

Committee draft report on discontinued FBI Cointelpros. Barbara

Banoff of the Committee staff made available three copies of the SSC

draft report dated 2/24/76, entitled "Cointelpro: The FBI's Covert

Action Programs against American Citizens," which were to be

reviewed for classification. The copies of the draft report were

noted "Sensitive" and it was indicated each copy was one of 13.

Classification: Two items appearing in the draft report

were deemed by the reviewers to require classification of "Secret"

or higher as their disclosure could jeopardize sensitive sources

and/or techniques in the foreign intelligence area. These two items

were identified on a separate sheet of paper and furnished to the SSC

on 3/3/76. They are being identified by separate memorandum.

Statement to SSC Staff: Upon completion of the review of

the draft on 3/3/76, the FBI representatives submitted in a sealed

envelope to Miss Banoff a statement reading as follows:

At the invitation of the Senate Select Committee

(SSC) staff, on 3/2-3/76, FBI representatives reviewed

the draft report of the Committee, dated 2/24/76

entitled, "Cointelpro: The FBI's Covert Action Pro-

grams against American Citizens." Items appearing

in this report which require classification have been

separately identified on this date to the SSC staff.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

The SSC draft report is based upon selective docu

mentation using out-of-context quotes from FBI corre-

spondence and depositions in support of conclusions

which are phrased in a subjective and condemnatory

manner in language calculated to present the Bureau in

a most unfavorable light.

As the entirety of the draft is couched in phrases

intended to indicate the Bureau deliberately violated con-

stitutional rights, and that that violation was in fact its

motive; and as the FBI reviewers had no concurrent

access to the depositions and other documentation

referred to in the draft, it is felt no purpose would be

served in attempting to refute the allegations page by

page. Nor would any valid purpose be served in attempt-

ing to argue with or contradict conclusions reached by

the draft's authors. Therefore, no comment will be

made on the content of the draft.

Finally, it is a matter of concern that inadequate

consideration was given to the rights of privacy of those

mentioned directly or indirectly in the draft, whether

private citizens, organizations which cooperated with

the FBI, or officials.

In reference to the above statement, the FBI reviewers

asked for a copy of SA Ryan's deposition which had previously been

submitted to the Committee so it could be checked against the draft

to verify the accuracy of statements attributed to Ryan in the draft

and also to determine if they had been utilized out of context. After

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

checking with the Committee Security Officer, Miss Banoff advised

the FBI reviewers would not be afforded access to any depositions or

other supporting documentation of the Committee.

Editorialization by the SSC: The draft, on its first page,

alleges "Cointelpro is the story of decent men who did terrible

things for what they saw as the greater good of the country, " without

any supporting material. Later, and throughout the report, it is

indicated "The techniques were adopted wholesale from wartime

intelligence, " apparently paraphrasing information furnished to the

Committee by former Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan

who is cited in the report as describing counterintelligence as

right but the duty to maintain the existing social and political order

by secretly manipulating thoughts and behavior and to immobilize

those who threaten that order by seeking activity to change it or by

adopting visibly different life styles." Further in the report,

Cointelpro is described as "a declaration of war on the advocates of

change" and also characterized as a "sophisticated vigilante operation."

The draft attempts to depict the Bureau in a most unfavorable light

by such statements as "The image of an agent of the U. S. Govern-

ment scrawling a poisoned pen letter to somebody's wife in language

usually reserved for a bathroom's walls is not a happy one. "

Finally, the draft alleges "The instances of attacks on speaking,

teaching, writing and meeting go on and on. " There follow several

examples of "attacks," leading to the draft's statement that "The only

conclusion that can be drawn from the cases is that the Bureau con-

sidered the First Amendment a danger to the country, " a conclusion

which is felt to be characteristic of the overall tenor of the language

of the draft.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

Quotes from Depositions: Among the present and former

Bureau officials quoted in the draft are former Assistant to the Direc-

tor William C. Sullivan, Assistant Director Charles D. Brennan,

Section Chies George C. Moore, and Supervisors Thomas J. Deakin,

Russell Horner and David Ryan, all of the INTD. As noted above,

access to the full depositions of these officials is apparently not avail-

able even to those who furnished said depositions.

However, Ryan's deposition is quoted in the draft in

several instances in a manner believed to be inaccurate or at best

distorted to support SSC conclusions. It is indicated in the draft that

Ryan, in his deposition, described "fellow travelers" as "those taking

positions supported iy the communists, such as school integration,

increased minority hiring and opposition to HUAC." Although Ryan

recalls defining "fellow travelers" in his deposition, the description

furnished in the draft report is not recalled, is not in his wording,

and is not in accordance with his views.

Also, in a footnote further in the report, a number of

Jurid and sexually oriented techniques are cited followed by the state-

ment "The subject could go on, but the subject is, 'as Ryan put it,'

'degrading.'" Ryan specifically remembers his use of the word

"degrading" was in reference to the insistence of SSC staff members

to discuss sexually oriented techniques to the exclusion of all others

during his deposition, and not to characterize Cointelpro. (Banoff

was orally advised by Ryan on 3/3/76 of this distortion).

Definition of "New Left": In an obvious attempt to support

its contention that the titles of the various Cointelpros and the targets

were vague and ill-defined, the draft report indicates "nor could any-

one at the Bureau even define 'New Left'" on page 4. This statement

is again reported on page 9. However, on page 40, in an apparent

self-contradiction, the report states "Some agents defined 'New Left'

functionally, by connection with protest. Others defined it by philos-

ophy, particularly antiwar philosophy. " The draft report ignores the

fact that former Assistant Director Brennan, in his public testimony

before the SSC, was asked to and did define "New Left." Additionally,

Ryan in his deposition indicated to the SSC he could define "New Left"

but did not believe it pertinent to his testimony. One former INTD

supervisor is cited in the report as stating in his deposition he was

unable to define "New Left, " and that he recalled no specific defini-

tion in Bureau documents.

Emphasis on Black Nationalist and New Left Programs:

While the report indicates over half of all Cointelpro actions were

conducted in the program which targeted the Communist Party, USA

(CPUSA), specific actions in this area are alluded to in a vague and

generalized manner. The report concludes the Cointelpros became

more damaging to constitutional rights as they progressed, with the

final two programs, which targeted Black Nationalists and New Left,

the most offensive.

Selective, incomplete summaries of numerous

Cointelpro actions targeting such groups as the Black Panther Party

(BPP) are cited with either no characterization of their propensity

for violence or with incomplete descriptions regarding their extremist

or subversive nature.

A specific example of failure to characterize an organiza-

tion with a propensity for violence occurred in the summary of a

Cointelpro action directed against a member of the Black Liberators.

A characterization of the organization would have disclosed it as a

pseudo military group composed of black militants who sought open

confrontation with the establishment and emulated the BPP in its aims.

In addition to the failure to characterize organizations, no effort was made

throughout the draft to outline the true objective of the FBI or to

indicate any positive results were obtained in any instance. Also,

on one occasion the report cites in some detail a suggested technique

of a sensationalist nature which the draft states was "apparently"

dropped, ignoring a communication furnished to the SSC reflecting

that the proposal had been dropped.

Unreported Cointelpro Activities: Quoting former

Assistant to the Director Sullivan, the draft report states that although

the formal program was instituted in 1956, Cointelpro-type activities

had been conducted by the FBI for years.

It cites the originating

Cointelpro document in the CPUSA as indicating an "ad hoc" Cointelpro

consisting of "harassment" had existed for years primarily operated

by the field offices. The formal Cointelpros are described as an

effort by the FBIto expand and formalize the scope and targets.

The SSC draft comments that it had been advised of two

Cointelpro actions effected after FBI Headquarters issued instructions

that the programs be discontinued and indicates a comprehensive

review of FBI files would undoubtedly uncover numerous others.

To support this contention, the report states the SSC dis-

covered a third instance of Cointelpro action which occurred four

months after termination of the programs. This instance involved

the furnishing of information to a friendly newspaper source under

the so-called 'Mass Media Program" intended to discredit an

attorney and his client. A footnote at this point in the report indicates

that Charles Colson spent seven months in jail for similar activity

involving the client.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

An effort is made in the draft report to indicate Cointelpro

actions were conducted under other titles and, as alleged by the

Socialist Workers Party, are still being conducted in the form of

harassment interviews, contacts with employers, etc. The drait

states ". . . actions in the Rev. Martin Luther King case which

cannot, by any stretch of the language, be called 'investigative' were

not called Cointelpro, but were carried under the investigative caption."

Inciting Violence: The report makes an extensive effort

by citing selective actions to indicate Cointelpro intended to incite

violence, including murders. In what appears to be an obvious

attempt to characterize the FBI as unconcerned regarding violence,

former Section Chief "Moore was asked whether the fact no one was

killed was the result of 'luck or plan.' He answered: "Oh, it just

happened that way, I am sure. '"

Numerous examples of actions

directed against the BPP, and particularly the BPP-US feud, are

cited to indicate the FBI incited violence which could be attributed to

actual murders. Frequent reference is made to "snitch jacket" tech-

niques which are described as "labeling a group member an informant

when he is not." Although this expression is not known to have been

utilized within the bureau, the report accredits it to former section

Chief Moore and indicates this technique could well result in violence.

The report does indicate in one instance in 1971 a technique was

"rejected because of the possibility it would result in a target's death."

It downplays these instructions by stating two other unidentified tech-

niques which could result in murder were approved shortly thereafter.

The draft report indicates a separate report is being pre-

pared on disruptive efforts aimed at the Panthers and it "will examine

in detail the Bureau's attempts to foment violence. "

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

Notification: In a more objective treatment, the draft

report sets out in some 15 pages details relating to Bureau documen-

tation alerting members of the Executive Branch, including the

Cabinet, and members of the Legislative Branch to the existence of

the Cointelpros. However, it is indicated that only the CPUSA and

White Hate Programs were discussed in documents notifying offi-

cials outside the Bureau, and in these instances the references to

Cointelpro were generalized or vague. The report emphasized the

Fiscal Year 1963 budget testimony explicitly outlines our Cointelpro

efforts, but questions that such information was ever presented

before the Subcommittee on Appropriations.

Department Review: The draft report criticizes the

Department of Justice review of FBI Cointelpros (Petersen report)

as incomplete, implying cover-up or a lack of penetrative interest.

It is indicated Department attorneys working with the Petersen

Committee were not allowed to work with original Bureau files/docu-

ments and were required to rely on FBI-prepared write-ups which

were incomplete. Portions of legal memoranda which appeared as

exhibits in the original Petersen report, and which have not previ-

ously been putticised, are cited in the sse drait and these, too, are

taken out of context or limited to support contentions of the SSC. The

SSC draft differs with the conclusions of the Petersen Report in that

interferences with First Amendment rights in the Cointelpros were

"insubstantial" and also in the Petersen report classification of some

techniques as "legitimate." It is indicated that although the Petersen

report concluded infringements upon First Amendment rights consti-

tuted only a small percentage of the overall techniques; the victims

in these instances would not consider the attack upon their rights as

insubstantial.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

In regard to the review of the Cointelpros by representa-

tives of the Civil Rights Division, the SSC draft indicates the decision

that prosecution was not warranted was "a finding endorsed by

Assistant Attorney General Stanley Pottinger after a hasty two-day

review of the documents in 1975." (On 3/3/76 Ryan pointed out to

Banoff that in his deposition he had indicated he had been present

when representatives of the Civil Rights Division, including Pottinger,

had reviewed the Cointelpro files and he considered the review had

been thorough, both as relates to general and specific areas. Banoff

responded by saying Pottinger, himself, had been interviewed and

had indicated his review had been "hasty. " It is noted Civil Rights

Division attorneys reviewed the five basic Cointelpros on three

separate days and spent an additional day reviewing more recently

uncovered FBI Cointelpro files.)

Miscellaneous: Typical of distortions appearing in the

SSC draft was the statement "As David Ryan, Chief of the Cointelpro

Unit. . " which indicates an overall responsibility of Ryan for over-

all Cointelpro activity. (Banoff was advised on 3/3/76 that in his

deposition he indicated he had been a Unit Chief responsible for

Cointelpro during the period 1963-67, and his primary involvement

was with the CPUSA effort. Banoff agreed the phrase was a distor-

tion and commented she realized. Ryan had no involvement with the

Black Nationalist or New Left Programs.)

The SSC draft cites Supervisor Thomas J. Deakin as

". . . the only Bureau witness to have reservations about Cointelpro's

constitutionality." Continuing, the report states "Another witness

gave a more typical response. When asked whether anybody at any

time during the course of the programs discussed their constitution-

ality or legal authority, he replied 'No, we never gave it a thought.'

(Moore deposition)."

Information set forth above is typical of the distorted

character of the SSC report. Ryan specifically recalls when he was

being deposed he was questioned if consideration had been given to

the constitutionality of Cointelpro techniques and he responded affirm-

atively. Ryan not only indicated this was a continuing consideration,

but he cited examples. One example which appears in Ryan's deposi-

tion relates to Cointelpro efforts to expose and preclude clandestine

Communist Party use of meeting halls. Ryan advised former

Assistant to the Director Alan H. Belmont had questioned the consti-

tutional proprieties of such action as possible violations of the First

Amendment rights, and efforts had been made to preclude such

infringements. It would appear the SSC staff selectively and deliber-

ately ignores information available to it furnished by witnesses.

Notionals (fictitious organizations) are briefly alluded to

in the dratt report. Three examples are given. One relates to an

organization whose members are all Bureau informants. The report

one relates to eport

indicates a notional chapter of the W. E. B. DuBois Club was con-

sidered but never effected. A second type organization is described

as one with unsuspecting (non- informant) members, and in this

example the establishment of a Klan organization under the control

of a Bureau informant (the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan)

is mentioned, indicating the Bureau paid the informant's expenses in

setting up this 250-member group. The third example relates to an

organization which is wholly fictitious for the purpose of disseminating

propaganda. The Committee for Expansion of Socialist Thought in

America (CESTA) is described as such a group. CESTA attacked the

CPUSA from the Marxist right for two years in approximately 1965-67.

Although the SSC drait is not severely critical of CESTA, it makes

no effort to point out evidence indicating the operations was success-

ful, it being noted this information was available to it.

While at the SSC offices, staff member Walter Ricks fur-

nished the FBI reviewers pages 17-52 of the SSC draft report relating

to FBI/ Internal Revenue Service (IRS) matters, and specifically to

disclosure by IRS of tax information to the FBI. This report indicates

approximately 200 requests were made by the FBI for tax returns

between 1956 and 1974, and 130 of these were for domestic intelli-

gence or "counterintelligence!' purposes. It is indicated the 130

requests primarily related to New Left and black extremist matters.

Although a large portion of this report cites the use of tax informa-

tion for Cointelpro purposes, the reviewers advised Ricks they were

not primarily responsible for reviewing this section of the SSC draft

report.

A copy of referenced SSC request is attached below

to the current SSC request for a list of itemization, the

following should be noted. J. ⅙. Deegan to Mr. IT. R. Wannall

memorandum 12/18/75, reported the request of ir. Shaheen of

the Department for a list of the reported 25 COINTELPIO-type

activities the FBI engaged in against King. He stated that

the request was channeled to him from the Attorney General

through Philip White of the Criminal Division. We then prepared

such an informal listing and delivered a copy to Shaheen as

noted in the Deegan memorandum and we noted that with little

exception, all the meterial referred to on the list had

previously been given to the SSC, including underlying documents.

In connection with the current SSC request, Mr. Shaheen tas

consulted by Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the SENSTUDY 75 Project

and he agreed that it was unnecessary to prepare any actual

list or itemization but merely refer the SSC to its prior

requests and our responses thereto. This has been done in

the Lit now going forward.

also noted the assumption of the SSC that all underlying

materiels pertaining to each of the incidents had been previously

supplied to the Committee and that in the event this ves not

the case, the SSC desired copies of such uterials.

In connection with MI. Adams' testimony it is noted

that at one point he was questioned by SSC Chairman Frank Church

about Ill efforts to discredit King. In answering a specific

question as to the efforts of the FBI to prevent King from

having an audience with the rope, Adams stated, "There were

approximately 25 incidents, I believe, of actions taken in this

regard.

I think Mr. Schwarz has those avallable, that I would

lump basically all of them into the same situation • . .."

At the time of Mr. Adams' testimony, his reference

Assoc. Dir..

to "approximately 25 incidents" was not based on any list of

Dep ADAiitenization'' of such ineidents which the FBI mey have compiled.

DID '''Kether, he was referring in approximate numbers and general

Admins, teras to the number of incidents whereby the FBI had taken

Ext. Affairs actlons concerning King which could be described as "discrediting""

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT FRANCIS T. LEONARD BY SSC STAFF

MEMBER MICHAEL EPSTEIN

on Friday, february 21, 1916, at approximately 10:30

A. M., Special Agent Francis

T. Leonard, who is currently

assigned to the Boston Division, met with SSC Staff Member

Michael Epstein in a room on the sixth floor of the Old Senate

Office Building, Washington, D. C.

Special Agent Leonard was not provided with a warning

as to his rights nor was he placed under oath at the outset of

the interview.

The only two occupants of the room at the outset of

this interview were Leonard and Epstein. Epstein ascertained

from Leonard that he had entered on duty as a Special Agent

with the FBI

on August 6, 1951, and had been assigned to the

New York Office from April 1955 to May 1967. Leonard stated

that during the period from 1955 through approximately 1964,

his work entailed investigations regarding the internal security

of the United States..

he was the case Agent of the Stanley David Levison investigation

during the late 1950s and early 1960s although he could not be

sure of the exact years because of the extensive period of time

that has elapsed since he was involved n that investigation.

Epstein queried Leonard as to his recollection of now he became

the case Agent in the Levison case, and Leonard replied that to

the best of his recollection the Levison case was reopened and

assigned to him based on new information that Levison was a

secret member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA).

This document contains neither

recommendations nor conclusions

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT FRANCIS T. LEONARD BY SSC STAFE

MEMBER MICHAEL EPSTEIN

At this point Epstein stated wasn't it in fact Levison's

issociation with Martin Luther King, Jr..

that led to the

reopening of the case and Leonard redlied that he was dositive

hat was not the reason for the reopening of the case dut

rather information regarding Levison's activities with the

CPUSA. Epstein inquired as to specifically what these

activities of Levison's were and Leonard refused to reveal

them because he felt that by so doing, he may jeopardize the

security of a

highly reliable source of the Bureau that had

furnished the information regarding Levison. Leonard further

explained that he felt this would be in violation of the agree-

no Felt the sould be

ment between the Bureau and the Committee if he should reveal

this information.

Epstein then showed Special Agent Leonard a memorandum

bearing his name to the SAC, New York, dated August 22, 1962:

entitled

Stanley

• David Levison and asked Leonard if he recalled

the memo. Special Agent Leonard stated that he did not recall

the memo but that undoubtedly it was

his memo and appeared to

be a

characterization of Stanley David Levison. Epstein then

inquired as to what the procedure was for formulating such a

characterization and it was explained to him by Special Agent

Leonard to the best of his knowledge.

At this point Epstein

stated that he would prefer to continue the interview with the

presence of a court stenographer and asked if Special Agent

Leonard had any objection to that. Special Agent Leonard

replied that he had no objection to a court stenographer being

At this point the interview was terminated at approxi-

mately 11:05 A. M.

The interview was resumed at 11:25 A. M. in the same

room with the court stenographer present and all the informa-

tion discussed in the first interview was repeated for the

benefit of the court stenographer up to and including the dis-

cussion regarding the characterization of Stanley David Levison

August 22, 1962. At that point in the second interview,

a report on Martin Luther King, Jr., written

by Special Agent John Elliott of the New York Office.

Epstein

asked Leonard if he knew Elliott and he replied that he did. : He

did not make the report available to Leonard but Epstein then

RET

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT FRANCIS T. LEONARD BY SSC STAFF

MEMBER MICHAEL EPSTEIN

asked Leonard if he was aware of any relationship between

Stanley David Levison and Martin Luther King prior to Leonard

being assigned the case Agent of the Levison

investigation.

Leonard replied that he was not. At this point Epstein

referred to page 17 of Elliott's report and gave the follow-

ing four dates:

December 26, 1956; September 24, 1958;

January 18, 1959; and May 6, 1960; on which it was reported

by sources of the FBI that there was a relationship between .

Stanley David Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr.

At this point Epstein produced another memorandum

written by Special Agent Leonard to the SAC, New York, dated

July 26, 1963, which was another characterization of Stanley

David Levison

stating that he was a secret member of the CPUSA.

Epstein asked Leonard if

he recalled writing such a memorandum

and he replied that although he did not recall it, obviously

it was a memorandum

written by hima that time.

Again Epstein

and Leonard discussed the administrative procedure that would

be used by the New York Office to make up a characterization

card regarding an individual.

During this portion of

the con-

versation, Epstein asked Leonard if he knew the identity of

the Agent who handled the highly reliable source that was

used to characterize Stanley David Levison.

Leonard stated

that he did know the identity of the Agent but refused to

disclose it because by so doing it could lead to the identifica-

tion of this highly reliable source of information.

reliable

At this

point Epstein asked Leonard what he meant when he said Levison

was a secret member of the Communist Party and Leonard pointed

out to Epstein that it was not Leonard but the source of this

information who described Levison as

a secret member of the

Communist Party and that Leonard was merely repeating that for

the purpose of making a characterization of Levison.

Epstein

then asked Leonard, what his definition was of a secret member

of the CP and Leonard said he could only give his own definition

because he was not aware of the criteria that Bureau headquarters

or the New York Office would have for such a definition. Epstein

stated that he desired Leonard to give his own definition which

he furnished as follows:

MEMBER MICHAEL EPSTEIN

1. An individual that would not openly take

part in any CPUSA function such as a national

convention or state or district convention.

2. An individual who would not be carried on any

membership list.

3.. Not to be a card carrying member of the CP.

4. Not to be publicly associated with any known

members of the CP, socially or otherwise.

Leonard further stated that a secret member would be an

individual who adhered to and supported the principle of the

CPUSA, that is, to overthrow the United States Government by

force and violence and that a secret member would make a

contribution to the CPuSA in order that they could accomplish

that goal whether it be financial or otherwise.

Epstein then asked if the FBI made any effort to

establish Stanley David Levison's connection

with the CPUSA

other than that which was furnished by the highly reliable

source referred to earlier in this memorandum.

Leonard stated

that there was a constant effort made by physical surveillances

and contact with other sources of information to determine a

relationship between Stanley Levison and other CP members.

Epstein asked if Leonard participated in any physical surveillances

of Stanley Levison and Leonard stated that he did recall taking

conara stated

part in such physical surveillances but could not recall the

results of these surveillances.

Epstein and Leonard then discussed memoranda regard-

ing technical

surveillances of Stanley David Levison in very

general terms. Epstein

asked if Leonard could recall

any

evidence of stanley Levison influencing the civil rights movement

at the direction of the CPUSA

and Special Agent Leonard answered

that he could not.

The interview was terminated with two last questions,

one regarding the fact that if Special Agent Leonard had

knowledge that microphones were installed at one time or another

in the hotel rooms of Martin Luther King and Leonard answered

that he had

recollection of general information to that effect

and, secondly, did Special Agent Leonard know William Sullivan

(presumably former Assistant Director William Sullivan) and

Special Agent Leonard replied his only personal relationship

with Sullivan was when Sullivan lectured to Leonard's training

1951.

The interview was terminated at approximately 1:35 P. M.

The honorable Harold R. Tyler

Dear Judge Tyler:

senate Selec

In your letter of February 10, 1976, you indicated that the

Department and the FBI are prepared to cooperate with us in respond-

ing to the request of the Government Information

and Individual

Rights Subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations,

provided existing guidelines and agreements established between the

we review and describe all lists and indices of individuals maintained

by the FBI for investigative purposes.

We have discussed with the Subcommittee staff your proposal and

the guidelines under which we reviewed and reported on the FBI's

domestic intelligence operations. The Subcommittee starf believes

the proposed arrangement and existing guidelines are generally

satisfactory.

It is our intention in this review, as well as in future reviews

of FBi programs and activities, to observe the general rules governing

the handling and disclosure of information which we established with

the FBI pursuant to the domestic intelligence review.' In this regard,

we will take all necessary precautions to protect any documents pro-

vided to us and will honor any security classifications applied to

those documents. All information will be treated in the greatest

confidence and in accordance with FBI security standards to prevent

even inadvertent release of sensitive information. As we did with

our report on the FBI's

domestic intelligence operations, issued

February 24, 1976, we will give the FBI the opportunity to review

the draft report on the resu to 2-0uF 6343e e3/ ether

it contains any sensitive information which the FBI believes might

compromise its operations.. Also, if during our review we receive

any requests for specific Department and/or FBI documents or files,

we will refer the requestor to the Department or FBI.

We are prepared to abide by the above ground rules; however, as

stated in my letter of December 30, 1975, to you, we must have access

to all persons and all records and documentation necessary to conduct

our review and answer the Subcommittee's request,

We do not presently

foresee the need for investigative files to complete our review.

We

cannot preclude that possibility, however, and would have to insist

on access to such files if the need arises.

Although any guidelines and agreements established between GAO

and. the Department pursuant to our review of FBI activities would be

honored regardless of which GAO auditors are involved, the review for

the Subcommittee will be conducted by the same staff that conducted

the domestic intelligence review. Since the Subcommittee requested

our review in November 1975, the

staff would like to begin work at

FBI Headquarters as soon as possible in order to expedite our response.

We will coordinate with FBI officials in this regard.

We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.

Sincerely yours,

Lites home

SYNOPSIS :

SSC Hearings, that have been published and released

to the news media, contain references regarding CPUSA funding

from the Soviet Union. The CPUSA funding is channelized

through SOLO operation and our Chicago Office feels this could

terminate the SOLO operation. We believe excisions of docunents

furnished to SSC were made properly and some examples of

previous disclosures are listed herein. A conference is

scheduled for 3/17/76 at FBIHQ to analyze extent of damage,

value of this operation, and future action.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

None.

Re:

100-428091

We believe the excisions were made properly as the

reasons for excisions do not pinpoint the SOLO operation and

the information is described as coming from several sources..

Previous references to SOLO data have been made

public and this operation has continued for over 24 years.

Some examples of prior disclosures are: (1) Newspaper article

by Victor Riesel on 4/14/64 which published the agenda for a

highly secret CPUSA meeting which was reported on by CG 5824;

(2) Another article by Riesel on 5/14/64 which comments on

"Moscow Gold," the Soviet funding of the CPUSA; (3) The

printed report of the Committee on the Judiciary, House of

Representatives, considering the impeachment of former:

President Nixon which was made available to the public in

mid-1974 contains on Page 408, Book VII, Part I, a phrase

from the Huston report that the CPUSA receives most of its

finances from the Soviet Union; (4) John Barron's 1974 book

"KGB" identified NY 694's Soviet contact as V. A. Chuchukin

as

a KGB officer and described him

as a di information officer;

and (5) The 12/1/75 issue of "Time Magazine" reports the basis

for FBI investigation of Martin Luther King was information

received in 1963 from two high-level

CPUSA officials regarding

communist party penetration of King's organization. As a result

of the publication of the "KGB" book, the Soviets suspended the

SOLO operation for six months.

A conference has been scheduled to be held 3/17/76

with representatives

attendance at FBTHQ.. Of Chicago and new York Offices in

We will discuss the extent of damage to

this operation based upon the current release of information

in the SSC Hearings, the value of the SOLO operation, and future-

course of action.

Memorandum to Mr. I. W. Leavitt

Re: S010

I00-42809I

DETAILS:

SOLo is our code word covering a sensitive

network of highest-level. informants operating against the

communist Party, USA (CPUSA) , the Soviet Union, and other

communist parties of the world. SOLO informants handle the

liaison between CPUSA and

USSR, ircluding the transfer of

money to the CPUSA.

The printed report entitled "Hearings Before the

Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect

to Intelligence Activities of the United States Senate, 94th

Congress, Volume 6, Federal Bureau of Investigation, " contains

certain information concerning the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA)

beginning on page 822 which was reproduced from FBI documents.

Printed as reasons for excisions is the phrase that the

docunent was excised as it could identify sensitive sources

providing information concerning CPUSA funding and travel

abroad by CPUSA functionaries. Volume 2 of the above report

contains a statement that most of the CPUSA finances are from

the Soviet Union.

The above. information has been furnished

Chicago and New York Offices and Chicago teletype 3/12/76

expressed conc in about the above information which could

terminate

this operation.

Copies of the SSC Hearings were released by SSC

Staff to the news media on 3/8/76; however, the general public

will not be able to purchase copies until about 4/15/76.

By way of background, Bureau letter 7/1/75 transmitted

to the Attorney General for his approval and for forwarding

to the SSC a document (Bureau letter 1/19/61 to the

Honorable Robert F. Kennedy) which contained a summary memoran-

dum setting forth the overall activities of the CPUSA.

This

memorandum was excised at FBIHQ and the reason for excisions

vandinge" as stated above, 'e information concerned CPUsA

By letter 11/14/75 to the Attorney General, Bureau

noted additional excisions which could be made to above

document which would result in its declassification from "Top

Secret;" thus authorizing the SSC to make it available for

public hearings.

PURPOSE:

To advise of proposal by the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

to delete a phrase currently in the SSC draft report which is classified

and insert an unclassified broad generalization of several investigative

techniques which would be published in the final SSC report.

SYNOPSIS:

An SSC staff member was advised on 3/16/76 that a pro.

posal to change the wording of an item in the SSC draft report on

Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros) so that it might be

declassified is unacceptable. A start member then proposed to

delete the classified item and insert an unclassified sentence which

summarizes several investigative techniques. There is no apparent.

basis for classification of the new proposal. The revision, if

approved, will be confirmed in writing by the SSC to this Bureau.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62÷116395

DETAILS:

A review of the SSC draft report on FBI Cointelpros on

3/2-3/76 by Intelligence Division supervisors determined that one

item which was unclassified should be classified "Secret." The

item, which appeared on page 78, paragraph 1, lines 6-8, read as

follows: "... to having the FBI Lab forge an informant*s report

in the target's handwriting, thus making it extremely difficult for

him to deny the accusation. **** SSC staff member Barbara Banoff

advised on 3/15/76 that the staff, after a review of this item, pro-

posed that "forge" be changed to "fake." She was telephonically

advised on 3/16/76 that the change was not acceptable to the Bureau.

She then proposed that the following unclassified sentence be inserted:

"The method of pointing the fingers range from having an authentic

informant start a rumor about the target member, to anonymous

letters or phone calls, to faked informant reports." Banoff then

advised this sentence would be substituted for the previous phrase

referring to the FBI Laboratory forging an informant*s report in the

target's handwriting.

The change now proposed by the SSC would seem to offer

no justification whatsoever for classification, and would appear to be

in such general terms that there is no danger that it would compro

mise any of our sensitive intelligence sources and/or techniques.

If the proposed change is approved, the SSC will confirm it in writing

to this Bureau.

By letter dated 2/17/76 from F. A. 0. Schwarz,

Counsel for captioned Committee, addressed to Michael E.

Shaheen, Jr., Counsel, Office of Professional Responsibility,

U. S. Department of Justice, procedures were set forth for

our review of draft reports relating to FBI activities. The

procedures allowed for our review for the purpose of determining

whether there were any "classifications (or other such problems,

e.g., the identity of informers) which may be inadvertently raised"

in the Committee's reports.

The procedures were that these re-

ports would be reviewed in Committee space.

Subsequently, on 3/8/76, Mitchell Rogovin of CIA advised

that William Miller, Staff Director of captioned Committee, had

agreed to a procedure whereby the reports would be reviewed in

the interested agency's space with the author of the report being.

Subsequent to the receipt of this information from

(Rogovin, John I. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director of captioned

Committee, was advised by SA Paul V. Daly of this Division that

consistent with Miller's agreement the FBI in the future would

review the reports affecting the Bureau in Bureau space. Elliff

who apparently was unaware of this agreement said he saw no

problem with this procedure.

Finally, It was pointed out at the February 24,

19/6, meeting that numerous documents concerned the most.

sensitive of matters, many classified "Top Secret." Consid-

eration has been given to furnishing exeised versions of

these documents to the SSC but it is epparent that such

excisions, as would be necessazy, would render the documents

virtually useless. It was also noted that some of the

natters discussed in the sensitive documents had already

been made known to the SSC through personal briefings by FBI

personnel and submission to the SSC of other documents.

Examples are matters rolating to surreptitious entries and

incommunicado Interviers. It was, therefore, agreed that,

in lieu of furniahing to the SSC the sensitive documents,

the memorandum to be furnished the SSC would summarize and

explain the situation in a manner which would satisfy the

SSC's request..

Enclosed for your approval and forwarding to the

SSC is the original of a memorandun in response to lis

December 11, 1975, request.

Also being furnished to you,

for your records, is a copy of the menorandum along wich a

(1) Investigative report dated May 23, 1975,

at New York CIty.

(2) Two FD-302's, both dated May 5, 1975, which

are Ineluded in the above report.

June 4, 1973. TBI letter to the Attorney General dated

The following concerns the "sensitive practices"

aspect of the SSC request. All but two of the documents

are classified "Top Secret," one "Secret" and one "Confidenttal."

Some of the natters discussed in these highly sensitive

documents have already been made known to the SSC through

personal briefings by FBI personnel and submiasion to the

SSC of other documents.

Examples are matters relating to

surreptitious entries and incommunicado interviewe.

The documents in the "sensitive practices" area

for the most part deal with sensitive sources and methods

and, in most instances, are in the realm of pecullarly

sensitive foreign inteltigence operations.

ALso, the

release of a substantial portion of these documents could

have an adverse effect on the foreign relations of our

Reference is made to the letter dated December 11,

1975, From SSC Chairman Frank Church to the Attorney

General, which discussed matters relating to FBI practices

which might be considered to be or have the appearance of

being improper, as well as sensitive FBI practices.

The

SSC requested certain documents relating to this matter.

Being delivered with this memorandum are a

number of documents, nostly of FBI origin, which are believed

responsive to the SSC request. Inasmuch as a mumber of

these documents deal with allegations of misconduct on the

part of present and former FBI personnel, the names of

these personnel have been excised for privacy reasons.

The following should be noted concerning the

Caputo matter about which the SSC is being furnished several

documents under the title "John Caputo." Additional

documents concerning this matter exist in the Department of

Justice files but, because they have been previously

furnished to the SSC, duplicate dissemination is not now

being made. FBI memorandum dated January 26, 1976, Facili-

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Your statement to the Cormittee on December 11, 1975 indicated

that on February 26, 1975 you instructed FBI Directör Kelley to report

to you "any requests made of the Bureau or practices within the Bureau,

which he deems improper or which present the appearance of impropriety."

You stated further that on February 28, 1975 Director Kelley ordered

FBI personnel to report such requests or practices to him. According

to your written statement, you reaffirmed your february directive in

; July 1975 and made an additional request "for a report of all sensitive

investigative practices."

You indicated that the Director promotly complied with your

directives and "has regularly provided information on conduct by Bureau

agents and programs underway within the Bureau that could raise questions."

In your response to questions from members of the Committee you

testified that the information reported by Director Kelley in response

to your directives dealt with FBI activities and programs outside the

COINTELPRO.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMNITTEE

TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS VITH

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

On March 2-3, 1976, EBt Intelligence Division supervisors

visited ine venate select committee us elrices at the Jirksen onice

Building to review the 133-page (double spaced) Committee draft

report on discontinued FBI Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros).

Barbara Banoit oi the Committee stair raade available three copies of

the SSC drait report dated February 24, 1976, entitled "Cointelpro:

The FBI's Covert Action Programs against American Citizens, " which

were to be reviewed for classification. The copies of the drait report

were noted "Sensitive" and it was indicated each copy was one of 13.

Classification: Two items appearing in the draft report

were deemed by the reviewers to require classification of "Secret"

or higher as their disclosure could jeopardize sensitive sources

and/or teciniques in the foreign intelligence area. These two items

were identified on a separate sheet of paper and furnished to the SSC

on Farch 3, 1976.

Denial oi Access to Supporting Documents: The FBI

reviewers asked for a copy of Special Agent Fyan's deposition which

had previously been submitted to the Committee so it could be checked

against the draft to verify the accuracy of statements attributed to

Ryan in the drait and also to determine if they had been utilized out

of context, After checking with the Committee Security Oificer,

Miss Banoit advised the FBI reviewers would not be afforded access

to any depositions or other supporting documentation of the Committee.

United States Senate Select Committee

To Study Governmental Operations with

Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

Editorialization by the SSC; The drait, on its first page,

alleges "Cointelpro is the story of decent men who did terrible

things for what they saw as the greater good of the country," without

any supporting material. Later, and throughout the report, it is

indicated "The techniques were adopted wholesale from wartime

intelligence, " apparently paraphrasing information furnished to the

Committee by former Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan

who is cited in the report as describing counterintelligence as

"dirty business," '"The unexpressed major premise of programs

(Cointelpros) was that a law enforcement agency has not only the

right but the duty to maintain the existing social and political order

by secretly manipulating thoughts and behavior and to immobilize

those who threaten that order by seeking activity to change it or by

adopting visibly different life styles." Further in the report,

Cointelpro is described as "a declaration of war on the advocates of

change" and also characterized as a "sophisticated vigilante operation,"

The drait attempts to depict the Bureau in a most unfavorable light

by such statements as "The image of an agent of the U. S, Covern-

ment scrawling a poisoned pen letter to somebody's wife in language

usually reserved for a bathroom's walls is not a happy one."

Finally, the drait alleges "The instances of attacks on speaking,

teaching, writing and meeting go on and on. " There follow several

examples of "attacks," leading to the drait's statement that "The only

conclusion that can be drawn from the cases is that the Bureau con-

sidered the First Amendment a danger to the country," a conclusion

which is felt to be characteristic of the overall tenor of the language

of the drait.

Quotes from Depositions: Among the present and former

Bureau officials quoted in the drait are former Assistant to the Direc-

tor William C. Sullivan, Assistant Director Charles D. Brennan,

United States Senate Select Committee

To Study Governmental Operations with

Fespect to Intelligence Activities (ESC)

Section Chief George C. Moore, and Supervisors Thomas J. Deakin,

Fussell Horner and David Ryan, all of the Intelligence Division (INTD).

As noted above, access to the full depositions of these officials is

apparently not available even to those who furnished said depositions.

However, Ryan's deposition is quoted in the drait in

several instances in a manner believed to be inaccurate or at best

distorted to support sec conclusions.

It is indicated in the draft that

Fyan, in his deposition, described "fellow travelers" as "those taking

positions supported by the communists, such as school integration,

increased minority hiring and opposition to HUAC," Although Hyan

recalls defining "fellow travelers" in his deposition, the description

furnished in the draft report ie not recalled, is not in his wording,

and is not in accordance with his views.

Also, in a footnote further in the report, a number of

lurid and sexually oriented techniques are cited followed by the state-

ment "The subject could go on, but the subject is, 'as Fyan put it,'

'degrading. '" Ryan specifically remembers his use of the word

"degrading" was in reference to the insistence of SSC staff members

to discuss sexually oriented techniques to the exclusion of all others

during his deposition, and not to characterize Cointelpro. (Banoff

was orally advised by Fiyan on March 3, 1976, of this distortion. )

Definition of "New Left": In an obvious attempt to support

its contention that the titles of the various Cointelpros and the targets

were vague and ill-defined, the draft report indicates "nor could any-

one at the Bureau even define 'New Left'" on page 4. This staterent

is again reported on page 9. However, on page 40, in an apparent

self-contradiction, the report states "Some agents defined 'New Left'

functionally, by connection with protest. Others defined it by philos-

ophy, particularly antiwar philosophy." The draft report ignores the

fact that former Assistant Director Brennan, in his public testimony

before the SSC, was asked to and did define "New Left." Additionally,

Ryan in his deposition indicated to the ESC he could detine "New Left"

but did not believe it pertinent to his testimony. One former INTD

supervisor is cited in the report as stating in his deposition he was

unable to define "New Left,"' and that he recalled no specific defini-

tion in Bureau documents.

(An FBI document dated October 28, 1063, captioned

"New Left Movement," contains a detailed definition of "New Left."

A copy of this document was referred to the SSC and it appears as

Exhibit 61 on page 669 in Volume 6 of the published SSC hearings

relating to the FBI, November 18-19, December 2-3, Đ-11, 1075.)

Emphasis on Black Nationalist and New Left Programs:

While the report indicates över half of all Cointelpro actions were

conducted in the program which targeted the Communist Party, USA

(CPUSA), specific actions in this area are alluded to in a vague and

generalized manner. The report concludes the Cointelpros became

more damaging to constitutional rights as they progressed, with the

final two programs, which targeted Black Nationalists and New Leit,

the most offensive. Selective, incomplete summaries of numerous

Cointelpro actions targeting such groups as the Slack Panther Party

(SPP) are cited with either no characterization of their propensity

for violence or with incomplete descriptions regarding their extremist

or subversive nature.

A specific example of failure to characterize an organi-

zation with a propensity for violence occurred in the summary a a

Cointelpro action directed against a member of the Black Liberators.

A characterization of the organization would have disclosed it as a

pseudomilitary group composed of black militants who sought open

confrontation with the establishment and emulated the BPP in its aims.

In addition to the failure to characterize organizations, no effort was

made throughout the draft to outline the true objective of the FBI or

to indicate any positive results were obtained in any instance. Also,

on one occasion the repori cites in some detail a suggested technique

of a sensationalist nature which the draft states was "apparently"

dropped, ignoring a communication furnished to the SSC reflecting

that the proposal had been dropped,

Unreported Cointelpro Activities: Cuoting former

Assistant to the Director Sullivan, the drait report states that

although the formal program was instituted in 1956, Cointelpro-type

activities had been conducted by the FBI for years.

It cites the orig

inating Cointelpro document in the CPUSA as indicating an "ad hoc"

Cointelpro consisting of "harassment" had existed for years primarily

operated by the field offices. The formal Cointelpros are described

as an effort by the r'Bi to expand and formalize the scope and targets.

The SSC draft comments that it had been advised of two

Cointeloro actions effected after FCi Headquarters issued instructions

that the programs be discontinued and indicates a comprehensive

review of fBI files would undcubtedly uncover numerous others.

To support this contention, the report states the SSC dis-

covered a third instance of Cointelpro action which occurred four

months after termination of the programs. This instance involved

the furnishing of information to a friendly newspaper source under

the so-called "Mass iedia Program" intended to discredit an

attorney and his client. A footnote at this point in the report indicates

that Charles Colson spent seven months in jail for similar activity

involving the client.

(Although the above-described action might be described

as of a Cointelpro-type, it was not conducted under any Cointelpro,

The action is not specifically identified in the SEC drait report, but

in Volume 6 of published SSC hearings, November 18-19,

December 2-s, 9-11, 1975, the action is described in testimony of

SSC staff member John Ellift appearing on page 105, and in staff

report entitled "Political Abuse and the FBI" which appears as

Exhibit 36 on page 470. The action relates to FBI furnishing of pablic

record information to a newsman regarding the communist associa-

tlons of Ieonard B. Boudin, attorney for Daniel Elisberg. Exhibit 37,

page so0 of the same published volume, indicates the action was con-

ducted under the Boudin caption without reference to Cointelpro.)

An effort is made in the draft report to indicate

Cointelpro actions were conducted under other titles and, as alleged

by the Socialist Workers Party, are still being conducted in the form

of harassment interviews, contacts with employers, etc. The draft

states "... actions in the Rev. Martin Luther King case which

cannot, by any stretch of the language, be called 'investigative' were

not called Cointelpro, but were carried under the investigative caption."

Inciting Violence: The report makes an extensive effort

by citing selective actions to indicate Cointelpro intended to incite

violence, including murders. In what appears to be an obvious

attempt to characterize the FBI as unconcerned regarding violence,

former Section Chief "Moore was asked whether the fact no one was

killed was the result of 'luck or plan.' He answered: 'Oh, it just

happened that way, I am sure. "f Numerous examples of actions

directed against the BPP, and particularly the BPP-US feud, are

cited to indicate the FBI incited violence which could be attributed to

actual murders. Frequent reference is made to "snitch jacket" tech-

niques which are described as "labeling a group member an informant

when he is not." Although this expression is not known to have been

utilized within the Bureau, the report accredits it to former Section

Chief Moore and indicates this technique could well result in violence.

The report does indicate in one instance in 1971 a technique was

"rejected because of the possibility it would result in a target's death."

It downplays these instructions by stating two other unidentified tech-

niques which could result in murder were approved shortly thereafter.

The draft report indicates a separate report is being pre-

pared on disruptive efforts aimed at the Panthers and it "will examine

in detail the Bureau's attempts to foment violence. "

Notification: In a more objective treatment, the drait

report sets out in some 15 pages details relating to Buresu documen-

tation alerting members of the Executive Branch, including the

Cabinet, and members of the Legislative Branch to the existence of

the Cointelpros. However, it is indicated that only the CPUSA and

White Hate Programs were discussed in documents notifying offi

cials outside the Bureau, and in these instances the references to

Cointelpro were generalized or vague. The report emphasized the

Fiscal Year 1903 budget testimony explicitly outlines our Cointelpro

efforts, but questions that such information was ever presented

before the Subcommittee on Appropriations.

Department Review: The draft report criticizes the

Department of Justice review of FBI Cointelpros (Petersen report)

as incomplete, implying cover-up or a lack of penetrative interest.

It is indicated Department attorneys working with the Petersen

Committee were not allowed to work with original Bureau files/docu-

ments and were required to rely on FBI-prepared write ups which

were incomplete. Portions of legal memoranda which appeared as

exaly been pubell, et eated te toes diat and the so, too,

are taken out of context or limited to support contentions of the SSC.

The SSC draft differs with the conclusions of the Petersen report in

that interferences with First Amendment rights in the Cointelpros

were "insubstantial" and also in the Petersen report classification

of some techniques as "legitimate," It is indicated that although the

Petersen report concluded intringements upon First Amendment

rights constituted only a small percentage of the overall techniques,

the victims in these instances would not consider the attack upon

their rights as insubstantial.

In regard to the review of the Cointelpros by representa-

tives of the Civil Fights Division, the SSC draft indicates the decision

that prosecution was not warranted was "a finding endorsed by

Assistant Attorney General Stanley Pottinger after a hasty two-day

review of the documents in 1975." (On March 3, 1976, Ryan pointed

out to Banot that in his deposition he had indicated he had been

review had been thorough, as relates to both general and specific

areas. Banolf responded by saying Pottinger, hirself, had been

interviewed and had indicated his review had been "hasty. " It is

noted Civil Rights Division attorneys reviewed the live basic

Cointelpros on three separate days and spent an additional day review-

ing more recently uncovered FBI Cointelpro illes. )

Miscellaneous:

Typical of distortions appearing in the

SSC draft was the statement "As David Fyan, Chief of the Cointelpro

Unit, " which indicates an overall responsibility of Fyan for over-

all Cointelpro activity. (Banoff was advised on March 3, 1976, that

in his depositton he indicated he had been a Unit Chief responsible

for Cointelpro during the period 1963-67, and his primary involve-

ment was with the CPUSA effort. Banoff agreed the phrase was a

distortion and commented she realized Ryan had no involvement

with the Black Nationalist of New Left Programs.)

The OSC arait cites Supervisor Thomas J. Dealin as

"'... the only Bureau witness to have reservations about Cointelpro's

constitutionality." Continuing, the report states "Another witness

gave a more typical response. When asked whether anybody at any

time during the course of the programs discussed their constitution-

ality or legal authority, he replied, 'No, we never gave it a thought.'

(Moore deposition). "

Information set forth above is typical of the distorted

character of the SSC report. Fyan specifically recalls when he was

being deposed he was questioned it consideration had been given to

the constitutionality of Cointelpro techniques and he responded affirm-

atively. Ryan not only indicated this was a continuing consideration,

but he cited examples. One example which appears in Ryan's deposi-

tion relates to Cointelpro efforts to expose and preclude clandestine

Communist Party use of meeting halls. Eyan advised former

Assistant to the Director Alan I1. Belmont had questioned the consti-

tutional proprieties of such action as possible violations of the First

Amendment rights, and efforts had been made to preclude such

infringements.

Notionals (fictitious organizations) are brietly alluded to

in the draft report. Three examples are given, One relates to an

organization whose members are all Bureau informants. The report

indicates a notional chapter of the W. E. B. DuBois Club was con-

sidered but never effected. A second type organization is described

as one with unsuspecting (non-informant) members, and in this

example the establishment of a Klan organization under the control

of a Bureau informant (the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan)

is mentioned, indicating the Bureau paid the informant's expenses in

setting up this 250-member group. The third exomple relates to an

organization nich is wholly fictitious for the purpose of disseminating

propaganda. The Committee for Expansion of Socialist Thought in

America (CESTA) is described as such a group. CESTA attacked the

CPUSA from the Marxist right for two years in approximately 1965-67.

Although the SSC drait is not severely critical of CESTA, it makes

no effort to point out evidence indicating the operation was success-

ful, it being noted this information was available to it.

PURPOSE:

To advise of action taken by the Senate Select Committee

(SSC) regarding classification changes made as a result of a review of

the SSC draft report on 3/2-3/76 by Intelligence Division supervisors.

SYNOPSIS:

The SSC staff, as a result of suggestions made by Intelli

gence Division supervisors following review of the SSC draft report

on FBI Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros), agreed to delete

one- item entirely and seek a change in wording of the other item so

it might be declassified. The Bureau takes the position at this time

that change would be unacceptable to warrant declassification because

of possible compromise of a sensitive technique with foreign intelli

gence ramifications.

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

DETAIIS:

A memorandum on 3/9/76 advised that as a result of the

review of the SSC draft report on FBI Counterintelligence Programs

(Cointelpros), it was determined that two items included in the draft

which were unclassified should be classified "Secret." At the con

clusion of the review, a written statement was submitted to SSC staff

member Barbara Banoff, setting forth the two items that should be

classified "Secret!' in order to protect foreign intelligence sources

and/or techniques.

Miss Banoff advised SA Don Ku: Pettus on 3/15/76 that

the Committee has agreed to delete any reference in the report to

the item which set forth the proposal that a representative of the FBI

Laboratory sabotage a printing press imported from East Germany

by the Communist Party, USA:

The second item which the review determined should be •

classified appeared on page 78, paragraph 1, lines 6i8, and read as

follows: "... to having the FBI Lab forge an informant's report in

the target's handwriting, thus making it extremely difficult for him

to deny the accusation.**** Banoff advised on 3/15/76 that the staff,

after a review of this item, proposed that "forge" be changed to

"fake," noting that this is not the only instance in which a fake infor.

mant report has been submitted. Banoff indicated the SSC would like

to have a reply on 3/16/76 as to whether the recommended change

would be approved by the Bureau. She did indicate that if the recom-

mendation was accepted a letter would be submitted by the SSC to the

Bureau confirming the change:

Supervisor David Ryan, on 3/15/76,

advised that changing the word "forge" to "fake" would be inadequäte

in that it could still compromise a technique which could cause

Communist Party members to conduct additional reviews of an

incident in 1965 when this technique was used in a successful

counterintelligence action with foreign intelligence ramifications.

On 3/8/76, Banoff telephonically requested SA Ryan to

review the original serials for the two items (100-3-104-34-1001 and

100-3-104-1492) to determine if they, in fact, were classified. A

review of the files determined the first item had not been classified

and the second was classified "Confidential." Banoff was advised

these serials were originally intended to be internal documents and,

when reviewed for classification retroactively, the first was over-

looked and the second was misinterpreted as to degree of classification.

Banoff was advised that publication of this information at this time

icould be reasonably expected to result in serious damage to the

national security as it could disclose intelligence sources and/or

methods, Banoti advised that she anticipated this information would

not be included in the published ssC report.

Item 1 above contains information received and reported

exclusively by our sensitive Solo informants and its publication could

cause speculation within the Communist Party as to their identities.

Item 2 relates to the capability of the FBI Laboratory in an area

This menorandun is being prepared to recommend that the

Director not appear as requested on an upcoming "Face the Nation"

On March 12th Joan Barone, Assistant Producer of "Face

liomer A. Boynton of my staff to request that the Director give

consideration to appearing on the "Face the Mation" program on

the Sunday after the release of the Senate Select Comnittee report

on the Bureau.

Miss Barone indicated that the report is scheduled

to be released at the end of hatch and, therefore, the appearance.

would be on sunday, April 2nd, or if the report is delayed, sunday,

April 1lth.

I feel that the Director should not appear at this time

on this progran. It can be expected that the final zeport of the

Senate Select Cormittee will be highly critical of the Bureau, and

I do not feel that the Director, because of other heavy conmitments,

vii11 have the time to be adequately briofed to respond to tha alle-

gations contained in the report.

In addition, it is felt that the

Director should not be stignatized by close association with the

alleged nistakes and improprieties of the past.

RECONMENDATION

That the Director not accept the invitation to appear on

"Face the Nation" and Miss Barone be informed that the reason for

this is the director is heavily committed for the next several

Special Counsel for

that I review the documents to see if the Bureau had any

objection to their delivery and to make any excisions which

the Bureau felt appropriate. After review, it was my

judgment that no problem was apparent except as relating

to one document, the New York report of SA Philip H. Sheridan

dated 7/12/63, "Communist Infiltration of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference; IS-C" (Bureau file

This memorandum reports the review by Special

Agent (SA) Andrew J. Duffin of that portion of the Senate

Select Committee (SSC) draft concerning the National

Security Agency (NSA) and the Watch List.

On 3/5/76, SA Duffin reviewed the portion of the

SSC draft report concerning NSA and the Watch List in the

SSC space. The draft, 94 pages, doubled spaced, entitled

"National

Security Agency Surveillance Affecting Americans"

was classified "Top Secret/Handle Via Comint Channels

Only" and was draft dated 2/26/76.

The review revealed that the vast majority of

the text concerned NSA and secondarily CIA and its

cooperation with and support of NSA functions and only

-

marginally dealt with the FBI. The references concerning

the FBI deal particularly with the Watch List and the FBI

input thereto. Several quotes exerpted from FBI documents

however, the original documents from which these were

taken were not available for review. EX-115 7 MAR 19 1976

There were three passages in the report which

the reviewer felt were misleading (contained on pages 2, 29

and 45) which were discussed with SSC Staff Member Brett:

Schneitter. Mr. Schneitter advised that the individual

who actually drafted the report was no longer with the SSC

and, upon reading these questioned passages, he (Schneitter)

agreed that they were subjectively written and deleted them.

Mr. Wobensmith was advised that it was the

Bureau's position that these names should not be set

forth in the report. He stated that was NSA's adamant

position and advised that NSA would continue to implore

the SSC to delete these names.

On 3/9/76, Mr. Brett Schneitter, SSC, supra,

telephonically advised SA Duffin that the SSC had decided

that no identities of either individuals or organizations

would be set forth in the portion of the SSC report

concerning NSA.

ACTION:

That no press response be developed regarding

the draft report of the SSC on the NSA inasmuch as it

is felt no new issues areraised which would warrant the

Bureau's comment.

Memorandum to Mr. I. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

Additionally, on page 29, a paragraph contained

examples of names of individuals and organizations

submitted for inclusion on the Watch List by Secret Service

and the FBI. Attributed to the FBI were Muhammed Ali,

Roy Innis and Eldridge Cleaver "as well as the Black

Student Unions at many colleges and universities."

Mr. Schneitter was advised that it would be the FBI's

position that these names should not be set forth in the

report for numerous reasons not the least of which would

be that they could ostensibly. lead to the revelation of

sensitive sources or methods on behalf of the intelligence

community through subsequent Freedom of Information Act

(FOIA) requests or law suits. He stated he appreciated

the FBI's position; however, the decision as to the

inclusion in the SSC's report was as yet undecided.

The original handwritten notes taken during the

course of this review are being maintained in the Senstudy

Project files.

On 3/8/76, Mr. John Wobensmith, NSA, telephon-

ically conferred with SA Duffin indicating that the SSC

draft concerning his agency had been reviewed numerous

times by NSA personnel and, in fact, by NSA's Director

and Deputy Director, both of whom passed on its contents

as to classification and accuracy.

He noted that ultimately

when the report is published it will not be classified

and NSA has agreed to this as they have successfully

accomplished deletions which would necessitate classification.

He advised that the only item contained in the report

with which NSA was still concerned was the setting out

of actual identities of individuals and groups as contained

on the Watch List submitted by Secret Service and FBI.

ARTICLE BY JOHN

CREWDSON,

"HEW YORK TIMES"

"TI PENETRATION, MARCELO, 1976

Director Sec'y -

John Crewdson, reporter for the "New York Times,"

contacted

Deputy Assistant Director Homer Boynton of my staff on March 9th to

advise that he was preparing a story which would allege that the

FBI

had been penetrated by the KGB on three occasions since World War

II.

Crewdson stated that one of these penetrations was in

New York, one in Washington, and one in San Francisco.

He related

that his information concerning the San Francisco penetration was

quite incomplete and had to do with some FBI documents which were

reportedly furnished to a member of the Soviet Consulate in

San Francisco and a member of the Consulate subsequently attemptes

to sell these documents back to the Government.

Involved an Agent in that office; however, Crewdson would provides

no additional details. He did state, however, that he was familiat

with the story involving

a waitress in a restaurant next

the New York FBI Office who had had an affair with an Agent in the

Rew

Yark Office; however, Crewdson was also aware that this matters

was concluded with a determination that it was not a penetration

of the FBI by the KGB.

crewason also advised that he had additional intormation!

that an Agent in the Washington Field Office (whose name he did not

know was involved with the KGB and that this Agent had obtained

some documents fron the Washington Field Office and had furnished

them to the Soviets.

The Bureau resolved this matter when it observed

the Agent making a telephone call from a telephone booth--supposedly

to a Soviet contact.

The telephone booth which was in Montgomery

Washington Field

Office. The Agent who was

Soviets was observed making a phone call and was subsequently inter-

viewed

. and fired.

Crewdson stated that he had all of the aforementioned

information from a highly reliable source.

The following statement was furnished to Crewdson as

the Director's reponse to the allegations set forth above:

"FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley advised that all

U.S. Intelligence agencies are targets for pene

tration by hostile foreign intelligence services.

The FBI is no exception and is constantly on the

alert to detect such attempts at penetration.

the years several allegations have come to our

attention that attempts have been, made to penetrate

the FBI.

Exhaustive investigations have not disclosed

any evidence that a hostile foreign intelligence

service ever successfully recruited or operated an

employee of the FBI."

This memorandum reports the review of that

section of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) drast report

captioned YIRS:

An Intelligence Resource and Collector""

by Section Chief R. I. Shackelford and Special Agent B. C.jl

IOr Bureau personnel to review above document for need for

A request was made to the Legal Counsel Division

classification.

On 3/2/76 this review was conducted consisting

of pages 17 through 52 of that document and based on the

review of the document alone, which was the only material

available, no need for classification is evident.

The document purportedly studies the means

03

obtaining and the uses made of IRS tax information.

The

report relates primarily to the pre-1968 period and criticizes

IRS for release of tax information without requiring a stated

purpose and criticizes the FBI for some of its uses of the

information.

For your information, the pre-1968 procedures

for obtaining tax information by the FBI would appear to have

been accurately supported.

There was no definition of the

exact procedures subsequent to 1968 other than to mention that

in 1968 by virtue of IRS request procedures were changed. No

reference was made to procedures used for obtaining tax

information subsequent to 1968.

Beginning in 1968 IRS

tightened up their procedures and required a formal letter

from an Assistant Attorney General for the Bureau to obtain

the returns. In general, the report was highly criteali

IRs for the release of tax iXol at RECitant stated purpose 4 95

and highly critical of what appear

In support of their conclusion of improper use of

it was pointed out that material contained on pages 49 and 50

Ricks advised that he could not say positively

that this information was obtained from FBI documents and,

admitted that the language used appeared somewhat

to put the FBI's role in proper perspective. Ricks stated

he would discuss this matter with other staff members and

try to find the source of the conclusions and if the comments

were not documented try to make appropriate revisions.

The portion of the report reviewed by Bureau

personnel contained no recommendations by SSC. With the

exception of the above-cited information concerning SDS,

all material cited appears to have been documented and facts

as set forth stood on their own.

RECOMMENDATION:

Because of selection of the SSC of isolated instances

of questionable use of IRS tax information, no press response

be developed attempting to challenge this section of the

draft report.

The primary thrust of the report is aimed at

IRS release of tax information without requiring sufficient

justification.

Dear Mike:

During the week of March 1-5, 1976, Mr. Robert Shackleford

and other officials of the FBI Intelligence Division re-

viewed a draft portion of the Select Committee's final re-

port on domestic intelligence. This portion of the report

included the following:

B. The Establishment of a Permanent Domestic Intel-

ligence Structure: 1936-1945

C. Domestic Intelligence in the Cold War Era:

1946-1963.

This letter is to confirm that John Elliff was assured by

Mr. Shackleford that the FBI has no objection on security

grounds to the publication of this report. If any changes

are made in the substance of this portion of the report,

it will be resubmitted prior to publication.

Thanks very much for your help throughout the inquiry into

this subject.

On 3/2-3/76 Supervisors Don K, Pettus, Arthur G. Pote

review the drait of the Committee's report on Cointelpros for the need

for classification and related matters.

A separate memorandum is

being prepared detailing the results of this review.

forth herein was furnished in personal conversations by SSC staff

member Barbara Banoff. Because it is not known what assumption

of confidentiality was intended by Banoff, it is being set forth herein

for background purposes to assist those officials involved in matters

relating to the SSC.

UNRECOND COPY RILED IC2

On 3/2/76, in furnishing copies of the draft report to

Bureau representatives, Banoff stated "Try not to get upset about

the inflammatory statements." On 3/3/76 Banoff commented that

this was the fifth draft of the SSC report on Cointelpros, indicating

disagreement with many of the changes made. When one of the Büreau

representatives indicated to her that much of the language of the report

did not sound like her wording, she indicated the report had been sub-

jected to considerable rewriting by SSC Chief Counsel Frederick A. O.

Schwarz, Jr. She said Schwarz had edited and rewritten the report

and instructed her to take similar action to give it "punch"' and add

'color. She said Schwarz had completely rewritten, himself, the

first two pages of the report and he had also eliminated from the

report "flatter" material inserted by Banoff.

It is noted the first two pages of the draft report contained

such statements as "Cointelpro is the story of decent men who did

terrible things for what they saw as the greater good of the country, "

and ". . . the techniques were adopted wholesale from wartime

intelligence."

Banoff also advised that after Schwarz had rewritten

portions of the report, it had been read by Committee member

Senator Walter E. Mondale. Mondale had returned the report, instruc

ting some of the "editorializing!' be eliminated..

On 3/2/76 Ryan was greeted by Schwarz, at the Committee

doffices.

Schwarz. queried as to Ryan's opinion of the draft report.

When Ryan indicated the report was based on selective documentation,

much taken out of context, Schwarz: responded, "Well, what did you

lexpect?"

Banott opined the drait report on Cointelpro would

receive considerable additional editing by Schwarz, Minority Counsel

Curtis R.

Dear Mike:

TUATION CONTAILO

DAS 11-2-0050,32

In recent days the Select Committee has submit-

ted portions of its report to the FBI for review to deter-

mine whether their publication might inadvertently reveal

classified information.

This process is proceeding smooth-

ly, and I have advised you periodically of the results.

I want to assure you that the Select Committee

does not intend to publish any materials without prior

review by the FBI.

The inclusion in the report of specific

references to, quotations from, or summaries of material

provided by the Bureau does not mean that the Committee

will interpret clearance of the report by the Bureau as a

basis for disclosing the underlying materials:

additional materials of portions thereof which ao natt

"In the report are to

"be considered" for püblication

or other public release, prior review by the FBI will be

sought.

not subject to the same reporting requirements as full

It seems clear that preliminary investigations will'"

constitute the bulk of such cases in terms of the

number. of cases, though probably not in terms of in-

vestigative effort expended.

The quidelines indicate

that preliminary investigations may be terminated' at tir.

The guidelines for domestic security Investi-:

ments which will enable your department to closely monitor

most of the described activities.

I would like to be

able to implement with your department a method whereby:

the Congress can be a participant in the receipt and

analysis of such reports. I believe this to be extremely

important at the beginning while the guidelines are

getting their initial field testing. On this issue, I

would also appreciate your earliest comment and response,

At approximately 5:00 p.m. on 3-8-76, John Elliff

Director Soc'y -

Domestic Task Force Director of the Senate Select Committee, advised

Inspector John B. Hotis that the final report released earlier that

afternoon by the Senate Select Committee contained information that

was to ta years on the listen set orth that lame

individuals and organizations that were the subjects of 13 telephone

surveillances and one microphone surveillance. The report also included

memoranda containing the names or initials of FBI personnel who had

reviewed or approved the surveillances. Among the subjects identified

were the Black Panther Party, the CPUSA, the Jewish Defense League,

Huey Newton, and two women who were active in the New Left. -

- :

Elliff said he had given explicit instructions that this

information was to be excised before publication and did not know why

it was included in the final report. He said that 30 copies of the report

had already been distributed to members of the press,..

and it was not

likely they could be recalled. He also felt that any attempt to have

the documents returned would draw the press's attention to the problem.

Elliff said he regretted the oversight but did not think there was anything

further that could be done about the disclosures.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: SENSTUDY

ADDENDUM BY LEGAL COUNSEL, 3/9/76, JAM:mid

Inspector Hotis advised me of the above information immediately

after receiving it from John Elliff.a I instructed him to advise the

Intelligence Division while I alerted Mr. Adams to the problem. Mr. Adams

instructed that copies of the materials released by the Committee should

be made available to the Intelligence Division as soon as possible in order

that they could be reviewed to determine whether any other materials

were improperly included. I instructed SA John Dennis Miller to

obtain additional copies of the materials and provide them to the Intelligence

Division on the evening of March 8, 1976, and he did so. I advised

Assistant Director Leavitt of Mr. Adams' instructions and requested him

to have the materials reviewed appropriately.

apparent slanted writing in the Senate Select Committee's

COINTELPRO report.

on 3/4/76, during a discussion concerning another

matter, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division mentioned to Domestic

Task Force Director John T. Elliff that there were apparent

problems regarding that Committee's report on COINTELPRO.

was pointed out that the Bureau representatives who had reviewed

the report felt there were statements taken out of context and

that in general it was a highly critical report of this Bureau.

Elliff stated that a decision had been made by F. A. 0. Schwartz,

Chief Counsel, and Curtis Smothers, Minority Counsel, that they

would highlight the actions taken in COINTELPRO and not describe

or characterize the victims or objects of COINTELPRO activities.

¡ At 1:05 P.M. ASAC Halter telephonically advised

he had now received information that king did not walk

in the march but was in an automobile at the head of it.

However, he left the march very shortly after it started

when the trouble began and Negroes began shouting,

"Black Power." Halter advised that there was considerable

looting on Main and Beale Streets.

The police used gas

to break up the march and at the time of his call the

situation was fairly well under control although the

Negroes were dispersing into other areas of Memphis.

He advised that the National Guard had been called and

the Memphis Unit would be activated, in about two hours.

The Jackson, Tennessee, Unit will be activated in about

six hours.

Halter said he had no information as to the

extent of injuries at this time.

The above information has also been furnished

to the Department and the military.

Tactics

will mainly be sit-ins and marches

which will be put into

play over a period of weeks and not all at once.

As of

April 22, 1968, Dr. King and up to 100 other civil rights

•and Negro community leaders from around the country will

start

visiting congressional leaders, heads of Government departments

The article indicated that well before the April 22nd

starting date, work was expected to start on a "New City of

Hope" with tents or temporary buildings set up on a 30 acre

site and supplied with electricity, sewer lines, an outdoor

theater, kitchens and parking.

The article indicated that if still nothing is done

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

FRINKS said that these 21 persons are recruiting others

to go to Washington, D. C., for the march and act as squad

leaders, guides, etc. for the masses who will follow.

He said

that his paid employees have a goal of 200 such persons and

that 1os have already been recruited..

After the recruitment

drive is complete, only a lew or the 21 will remain on the

payroll.

FRINKS said that he and his group of about 200 will

leave North Carolina on April 15 or 16, with a planned arrival

in Washington, D. C., on April 22, 1968. Concerning transportation,

he said

that the means of transportation has not yet been worked

out.

He said he has given consideration to buying old busses

or cars, but the busses especially do not seem to be available.

FRINKS said there has been

a suggestion to drive to a distance

of 100 miles south of Washington and then walk the rest of the

way.

There has also been the suggestion to walk the entire way.

FRINKS said he personally prefers to go by bus or car if possible,

stopping in the small towns en route.

He hopes to set up tents

at night along the

way.

He mentioned the town of Suffolk,

Virginia, as a possible first night stop. He commented that he

also hopes to set up tents in Washington, but he feels that they

will be prohibited

from doing this..

Upon arrival at Washington, D. C., FRiNks believes that

Dr. KING will be there to meet them.

Shortly after their

arrival, he believes that KiNG will make his demands and then

call all Negroes to Washington who have grievances.

The hard

core group of squad leaders and guides will be stationed at

the entrances to the city and at the federal buildings and

Jirect each incoming group to the office building

• that should

best be able to handle their particular grievance. FRINKS

estimated that the demonstrations in Washington will last about

three weeks.

FRINKS advised that he and Dr. KING are very much

concerned about STOKLEY CARMICHAEL and the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC) trying to interfere or take over

once the Negroes are in Washington.

He said CARMICHAEL'S

presence represents violence and the communist influence in the

civi] rights movement. He said Dr. KING spoke with CARMICHAEL

during the last week in February and has a promise from him that

he will not interfere with the plans of SCLC. FRINKS advised

that KING plans additional talks with CARMICHAEL. FRINKS said

if he does come, "we will bust his head."

He said that he is finishing a seven weeks leave of absence,

there are many more supporters than originally expected. He

mentioned that his telephone bill for his residence telephone

Miami, Florida, reported on February 22, 1968, that the

Ministers Leadership Training Program continues along

guidelines previously set out with little or no discussion

relating to the Washington Spring Project.

On February 21, 1968, the Miami Office of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation received an anonymous

• telephone call from a male who inquired if the Federal

Bureau of Investigation was aware that MARTIN LUTHER KING

was in Miami, Florida.

The caller statad he intended to

kill KING and would like to bomb KING's room at the Sheraton-.

Four Ambassadors Hotel, Miami, Florida, but feared injuring

other people.

The caller made reference to a German lugar that

he wanted to kill MARTIN LUTHER KING with and/or blow

up the hotel.

On February 21, 1968, BOB ASHAUER, Chief Security

Rev. KING in his talk discussed poverty, housing

KING made reference to a recent

violence at this time and KING denied that this was so, as he

does not condone violence in the civil rights movement.

Further along in his talk Rev. KING mentioned that

his group was planning massive demonstrations in Washington,

D. C., and five other major cities, including Cleveland, in

the Spring and Summer of 1968, to get action to aid Negroes

in the United States; KING gave no details of this project.

According to Chief ELWOOD, there were no problems,

Ada, Ohio, and KiNG departed that city curing the early

afternoon of 1/11/68, for Cleveland, Ohio, and New York City.

that Rev. KING spent any time in the Cleveland area on either

1/10 or 11/68, nor have they seen any indication that there

unequivocal commitment for prompt Congressional action.

If an affort is made to stop the Washington, D. C.,

demonstrations, simultaneous demonstrations will commence

in 15 other major cities throughout the United States.

In the interim SCLC will assign one or more staff

members to Washington, D. Co, and other cities to select

and train leaders for these demonstrations. It is King's

desire to train approximately 200 leaders in each of these

cities who in turn will recruit individuals to participate

in these proposed civil disobediences.

The above-referenced

the cities involved

and, there known, the identity of individuals who will

participate in this regard.

In view of the above, recipient offices are to

advise the appropriate local authorities of these current

plans of SCLC. At that time, close liaison should be

established with these agencies so that any information

in this regard received by them will be imnediately

furnished your office.

In addition, youshould alert your ghetto

I am confident that within the scope of your current

concern is the matter of public reaction to the proceeding

in which members of a House sub-committee recommended on

2/25/75 contempt citations against several responsible present

and/or former government employees for declining under

instruction of highly placed superiors to produce documents

or testily about a sensitive government intelligence program.

Accordingly, I have enclosed some remarks included in

copies of a letter of this date to Representative Carl B. Albert

and enclosure thereto, reflecting my view of what might be

expected as the normal reaction of many American citizens to

revelations concerning this highly charged and controversia

situation.

Pitila!

Dear Representative Albert:

I am enclosing for your consideration a compendium of reactions

such as could logically be triggered in the minds of many of our

citizenry across America upon being apprised through the news media

01

what transpired during the course of a House subcommittee proceeding

on 2/25/76 in which recommendations were made that several witnesses

be cited for contempt of Congress. The witnesses were all presumably

honorable and civic minded public servants employed past or present in

intelligence operations who, on orders from highly placed superiors

stemming from expressed wishes of the President, declined to produce

documents or to testify about a sensitive government intelligence

program.

It is sincerely believed that the views expressed are not greatly

unlike those likely to be found in many quarters were there to be a

taking of the pulse of public opinion on the matter. Brevity has been

sacrificed in order to bring out a sampling of a number of trends of

thought that could flow from an examination of the facts reported in

this case.

The views set forth in the attachment establish a basis for the

appeal in the concluding paragraph, which is highlighted by being

repeated herewith:

In the interests of justice and good government, it is hoped that

those who are responsible for voting on the contempt citations recommen

by the subcommittee referred to herein, including members of that

subcommittee, will take sufficient time to so examine and analyze all

pertinent facets of this situation as to assure final action that will

neve as lis sole motivation probity, with neavy emphasis on objectivity

impertlality, fairness, and a considered perspective on the real intent

of the Founding Fathers when they wrote our beloved Constitution.

REFLECTIONS ON REPORTED PROCECDINGS OF A HOUSE SUBCONMITTED

LEADING TO RECOMHNDATIONS ON 2/25/76 OF CONCHIPT CITATIONS,

AND ENUMGRATION OF SEVERAL LIKELY REACTIONS THAI COULD BE

STIRRED UP IN THE MINDS OF PERSONS COGNIZANT OF THE EPISODE•

HH 55166

A person presumed to be sincerely interested in fostering

respect fox law and order and for the wisdom embodied in our

constitutional form of government, might be hard pressed, either

through lucky inadvertance or deliberate design, to put together

in a single paragraph, more words to defeat the

above-outlined

purpose than may be found in the following example:

" The Attorney General is without any authority. It is the

most outrageous assumption, the most arrogant display by the

Attorney General I have ever seen. Some damn two-bit appointee

of the tresident is not the law-making body of this country."

It the account published on page 12 of the New York Times of

2/26/76 is an accurate reflection of what transpired during hearings

held by the Government Information and Individual Rights Subcommittee

of the House of Congress on 2/25/76, the above is but one of the

remarks attributed to a member of that subcommittee, reportedly

made in the course of attempts to extract information about the

government's interception of telegraph and Telex messages, that

give rise to natural questions about the dignity, propriety and

justification for such a bumptious approach to such a serious

subject matter.

To begin with, one might wonder to whom the author of the quoted

paragraph, Representative John B. Moss, was really addressing his

somewhat less than tactfully phrased object lesson on the apportionmer

of powers in our federal system of governmento

One might find it difficult to believe that any of the witnesses

reportedly confronted that day, F.B.I. Agents, a lormer F.B.I, Agent

and an employee of the National Security Agency, even by the vaguest

hint or most facetious remark, could have proffered the suggestion

thet the Attorney General (or any appointee of the President )

constitutes "the law making body of this country, " Witnesses such

as these are not noted for flippancy when under questioning by duly

constituted authority, and are not likely to be complete ignoramuses

regarding the basic structure of our government. They can be assumed

to have a better than grammar school level understanding of the

syster so wisely established by the Founding Fathers, with beautifully

designed separation of powers between three branches, legislative,

executive and judicial, and they can likewise be assumed to have a

general awareness of the containe nal powers alloted to each of

HE LESSOn, then, was Likely lost on, It indeed intended ior

Edward F. Levi, lest either somehow be lacking in knowledgeability as

to what does constitute

all, the legislator who

brought up the lesson material reportedly

make the assertion: " The real contempt here has been committed

by the Attorney General of the United States and the President of the

United States®'

Interestingly enough, after thus having had the finger placed on

where the alleged blame truly lies, the subcommittee, with commendable

promotess as a noteworthy virtue,

recommended contempt citations

for the witnesses who presumably were conveniently close at hand. Thus

WaS

Since the holder of the title Attorney General, whose office

created September 23,1789, has, from earliest times in our

Constitutionally based government,

been generally recognized as

the higest designated legal executive officer in the land, it

woà seem to be now a little late to contest in unceremonious

circunstances, the validity of this well-established custon having

its beginnings in our country's original cabinet membership.

The spectacle of a member of our country's law-naking body

Loualy declaring that "The Attorney General is without power" might,

in iiself, be sufficient basis for the generation of curiosity

as to the

degree of consistancy maintained by the author of this

rather startling new doctrine, when engaged in referring to power

as it applies to a cabinet officer, and when engaged in referring

to power as it applies (even by inference) to the office held by

• himseli.

In fairness, some might be heard calling, we must assume that it

was an inadvertant mistake - - no, rather, a deliberate exaggeration

Ior the sake of emphasis!

But alas! That is not the end of it! There are others who might

be responding along lines such as those that follow:

To refer to the Attorney General disdainfully as " some damn

two-bit appointee of the President", a characterization made even

more dramatic when coming from a Federal law-maker, might rightfully

be considered as an indulgence in rhetoric hardly appropriate to

the occasion, much less suitable at any time, and as certainly

hardly déstined to inspire respect for duly constituted authority

or confidence in those holding high office in the Federal Government.

at a time when lawlessness and alsrespect for authority ravage our

land, ilippant aspersions by one public official about the authority

of another are not likely to be helpiul.

In publicly charging the Attorney General with arrogance, a law

maker raises the question as to the applicability of the very same

term to his own conduct in so doing

This Attorney General was clearly acting on the expressed wishes

of the President ( assuming the New York Times account correct)

President Ford had already made it know in an earlier expression of

his views,

that he believes the public interest requires the records

sought not be disclosed to the committee.

This particular resident, unlike many elected fresidents who

preceded him, happens to be in office because of the esteem in which

he res held by fellow members of congress who put him there. Because of

his neavy, and only recently concluded backround in the legislative

branch of

the government, here is a fresident who is one least likely

to be unmindful of or callous about the rightful concerns of congress,

even as he

goes about the exercise of his new found duties in another

branch of our same governmento

That the President's opinion on this highly important matter should

be afforded courteous consideration seems self evident. Were such

needed, lending additional support than normal for the

sanity and

propriety of, placing reasonable confidence in this particular President

justification in any wording to be found in the Constitution,

There are few who would seriously contend that throughout

congzessional investigations conducted during the past year

related to the nation's intelligence community, outstanding skill

and wisdom have unerringly been exercised in the handling, protection

under the purview of the investigators. At this very moment, Congres

is engaged in efforts to uncover as yet unknown particulars

concernin

leaks and improper disclosures of information that have resulted in

damage to the nation's defense posture.

That some matters are of such a nature that they should rightfull

be regarded as, and properly handled as secret,

is specifically

instructed in the Constitution in the phrase : " Each House shall

keep a Journal of the Proceedings and from time to time publish the

sane, excepting such parts as may in their Judgement require secrecy

Having thus established the propriety of secrecy being afforded

certain appropriate matters coming within the cognizance of one brana

of the government, the tounding fathers, though not spelling it. out

in the constitution, can be assumed to have expected that good

juâgement would likewise be exercised by officials in the other

branches of the government in the prudent safeguarding of secret

information coming within their purview.

The word "secrecy" has come on hard times. In the hands of some

it has become a nasty word.

the connotations of " duplicity "

as applied to sensitive government operations, as if such should

sosshow be accepted as the basic part of the definition of the word,

were not distinctions that seemed of great concern to the authors of

the corstitution. It does not follow that they were accordingly

naive men, unaware of the frailties and connivings to be expected of

sore zembers of society, or that, because techniques have become

so much more sophisticated, their understanding of the word is no

longer valid.

Io recognize the unpleasant fact that there exists always the

possibility of a few miscreants lurking in government who would

hide behind the protective cover of the stamp of secrecy to cover

their mistakes, is hardly sufficient reason to obliterate secrecy,

where such is necessary to our survival in a world in which we are

surrounded by forces of hostility and by those who would not be w

happy over our downfall.

Unceasing efforts can and should be made to uncover and unseat

the miscreants, through prudent means, leaving the nation's secrets

entact, in the process. The old definition of the word

secret needs

no iteration.

Surely the thinking American public expects a strong and effective

intelligence gathering capability. Surely that same public recognizes

the zecessity for lucid and reasonable legislative guidelines to

help assure that capability.

Now, one might be inclined to inquire,

just what is the real

purpose, shorn of all trappings, behind this Subcommittee's

tenacious desire to obtain full

information about the government's

Telex and

• teletype interception project?

Could it be the uncovering of miscreants ? This would be one of

the functions of the legislative oversight process. But surely, in

view of the President's stand, there must be something beyond

this

to warrant the making of a public issue such as we see here.

On the other hand; one can assume that Congress has quite enough

considering moving permanently into the field of physically operating

collecting, assimilating,

disseminating intelligence datas

No, there certainly must be some other basis for insistance

on the

acquisition of the information and documents sought, and

the resultant responsibility that automatically flows with them

for assuring their ppoper storage and safekeeping.

Of one thing we may be certain! Our Constitution says nothing

about the right of the public to know everything.

Unfortunately for the security of the nation, there has been

considerable undue acquiescense about dreadful recently popularized

distortions of the real meaning of some of the freedoms guaranteed

are popular misconcepts about the intent of the so-called "freedom

of speech" and "freedon of the press" clause, that have been foisted

on a submissive public. An unwholesome aura of sanctity that has

been placed on perverted definitions of these freedoms has provided

cover for disclosure of state secrets and vital intelligence data

that never should have been made known to " the public". Realisticall

"the public" means not only the enlightened citizenry of this country

(as some would like us to believe), but in addition every unenlighten

eccentric, every ideological extremist, every scheming potential

enery, in every nut house, every subversive clubhouse, every espionag

center on five continents and on the islands and waters set between.

There is a sensation value, of but a temporary nature, inherent

in the disclosure of intelligence operatations data. Surely the

political or other gain achievable through taking advantage of that

value cannot be considered a legitimate goal in the absence of an

objective weighing of the goal against the potential loss of

intelligence capacity.

Iron one's home district to the office of congressman, in itself, by

no means qualifies one as an instant expert on matters of national

defense and international intrigue.

The President, as the nation's officer-in-charge of the nation's

intelligence-gathering community, on the other hand, does have

instant access to whatever vital experience resides within, or

whatever significant information is developed by that community.

At his fingertips are the best qualified experts in the nation on

intelligence matters. His knowledgeability about the sensitivity

of an ongoing intelligence operation, by the very nature of things,

can be presumed to be of a higher degree than that of the average

congressman. Axiomatically, his duty to assure protection to areas

where secrecy is vital, is

some completely different behavior that the Attorney General was

thus categorized, would it not be well to have this made known on

the public record, along with other details that have been made known

through the press?

Are the President and the Attorney General really guilty of

contempt, as claimed, or is this but a loose figure of speech?

It was not by any loose figure of speech that recommendations

were handed up that witnesses before the subcommittee be cited for

contempt.

There has

no issue raised here as

the civic-mindedness,

dedication to public service, patriotism, or loyalty to their oaths

of office on the part of any of these men.

Hopefully for the safety of our citizenry, the hard-earned

image of the average FBI Agent as a trustworthy and dedicated

public servant, has not been as greatly harmed by the massive

volome of one-sided adverse criticism leveled at the FBI as their

desractors, with all of their distortions, exaggerations, and

irresponsible behavior, would have wished.

It is not inconceiveable that the net result of a decision by

Congress to approve contempt citations against these witnesses,

might be not so much in any damage done to these few individuals,

as

the possible cheapening of the value of the process, through

undesirable dilution in the minds of a discerning public of the

gravity of the offense of being held in contempt of Congress.

No proper judgement can be made of the rightness or wrongness

On February 13, 1976, a conference was held in Kansas

City attended by the Director, 8 SACs and 2 representatives from

the External Affairs Division. The purpose of the conference was

to review ideas and procedures used by the field in promoting the

best interests of the Bureau through local media.

1

It was the general feeling of the SAls that one of the

most difficult problems in responding to criticism of the Bureau

relates to the reported abuses regarding the FBI's activities

• against Dr. Martin Luther King. The SACs felt that if an

appropriate answer could be prepared by FBIHO they would be in

a better position to counter such criticism.

While it was

explained that the testimony of Deputy Associate Director James

Adams was the best material available to respond to the

Martin Luther King criticism, the SACs felt that the Bureau should

have a more succinct and definitive answer.

FILED

The Director concurred with the observations of the

AL

SACs and instructed that an appropriate response be provided to the

field which could be used to counter criticisms of the Bureau's

harassment of Martin Luther King.
