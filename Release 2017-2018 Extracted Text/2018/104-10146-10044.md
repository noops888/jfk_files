SECRET

THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

Office of Legislative Counsel

| OLG # 78-3222

20 December 1978

Mr. G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel & Director

Select Committee-on Assassinations

House of Representatives

Washington, D.C.

20515

Dear Mr. Blakey:

Following our conversation on 17 December, about

CIA's reporting to the Warren Commission on Oswald's

movements at a certain

location outside the United States,

it occurred to me that it might assist your researchers

if I were to specify the reporting in question. (U)

I have already described oux role in obtaining the o8

information from

Tof the Cuban Consulate,)

and assume this needs no further specification..

Additionally,

it should be pointed out that on 31 January 1964 the Agency

submitted a fourteen page report to J. Lee Rankin of the

Warren Commission recording the basic information available

from Agency

sources.

Your investigators should be able to

identify this as being processed for fOlA as document

number 509-803, although it was not released under FOIA

because sensitive sources

and methods were involved; it

continues to be classified Secret to this date.

That

document has been reviewed at the Agency by your investi-

gators. (S)

That the information was provided the Warren Commission

early in its inquiry, in the two forms noted above, is

clear.

Why one of the investigators for the Commission

did not take it into consideration until some 3-4 months

later cannot be reconstructed at this late date. (U)

Very truly yours,
