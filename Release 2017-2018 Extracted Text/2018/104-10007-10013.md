MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Draft by Chief/CI/R&A for Reply to Army re

DUTKANICZ and SLOBODA

Raymond Rocca, Chief/CI/R&A, referred subject draft

to SR/CI/R for comment to insure that our factual material

was properly presented.

of SR/CI/R handcarried

the draft back to him at

1600 on 16 October 64 and suggested

one change.

This was in regard to the indications of

SLOBODA's pre-defection connections with the KGB.

2 October memo gave the BEVISION report as our

main reason for stating that SLOBODA had such connections,

with the other facts as supplementary reasons. Mr. Rocca

had reversed the emphasis onto the secondary reasons, but

he readily agreed to change it back. His problem was to

soft-pedal the question of whether the Army had been given

the BEVISION report on SLOBODA, but as he pointed out himself,

the Army had also debriefed BEVISION and would have been

expected to question him about Army defectors.

Mr. Rocca is now discussing the matter with Deputy

Chief/CI, James Hunt.

The draft has not yet been shown

to Chief/SR, but the finished product will be coordinated

with him.
