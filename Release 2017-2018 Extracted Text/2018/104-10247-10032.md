take place, We stated we would take this up with Roberto

4, AMWHIP-1 was asked if he knew Gareta Bango (GB)
whom -we described as a lawyer, 33 years old, who had just
arrived in Madfid and claimed that he had a message
obviously coming from. AMLASH-1 or members of his group.
AMWHIP=1 -¥eplied that he ‘knew GB who had been a friend -
of AMLASH-1"s_ for, the t twenty years, ANWHIP-1 stated

GB corresponded pretty well with that forwarded in (ADR) 3486
-(CIN 24298). . ANWHIP-1 stated it was possible, but not

probabie, that GB had been sent by the ANLASH.group to (5-2
convey the message as indicated in the forementicned (MADR)

- cable, ANWHEP-I-further stated he felt GB would be

Gee

personally loyal to AMLASH-1 in spite of any DSE suggestion
to the contrary. (This again is a feeling which AMWHIP-1
had and:is not to be taken as gospel.) He also mentioned
the brother of GB, Jorge, on whom there are a number of
traces at Headquarters.

5. AMWHIP-1 also discussed the contents of a letter
received from AMLASH-2, The essential part of this letter
plus a telephone call from ANLASH-3 from Madrid was that
EMLASH-3 was Somewhat upset by the fact that he was having
difficulty in getting a visa for the U. S. and/or the
Dominican Republic. AMWHIP-1 then spent considerable
time discussing the treatment of AMLASH-2 and ANLASH-3 in
Gjadrid) by KUBARK, He said he felt that AMLASH-2 and
AMLASH-3 should be contacted by KUBARK and treated and
handled well, If this were done, they would both serve a

“very useful purpose for KUBARK ends both in Europe and in

Cubs. The undersigned told AXWHIP-1 that we essentially
agreed with his position and would take up the matter with
our superiors when we returned tq Washington. On the
matter of the visa for AMLASH-3, we pointed out that we
Gould not intercede for AMLASH-3 in either case because it
Would be compromising to him, To illustrate the point we
explained that both governments knew that ANLASH-3 was a
Captain in-the Rebel Army and had up until recently been
working actively for a ministry of the Cuban Government

and therefore considered a Cuban official working in behalf
Of the Castro Government. As such AMLASH-3, or anyone in
that position, would not be entitled to enter either country
under normal circumstances. We pointed out that theCuban
Government in all probability knew of this; and, if AMLASH-3


succecded easily in entering either country, this would
be a rather obvious indication to the Cuban DSE that
-AMLASH-3 must be cooperating with one oF the other govern-
ment, AMWHIP-1 accepted the explanation and felt it
would be readily understandable and a good excuse to give

‘to AMLASH-3.

6. AMWHIP-1 also talked at length on the subject of
_AMBIDDY-1 and AMLASH-1. He repeated his previous position
.. ‘that the marriage: f£ AMBIDDY-1 and AMLASH-1 would brood
no good, ‘that an unnecessary number of people now know of
AMLASH-1's plans, and that AMLASH-1 himself was ‘very_
skeptical of the arrangement with ANBIDDY-1, Furthermore,
as a result of this, he is somewhat unsure of his position

vis-a-vis ODYOKE.

7. AMWHIP-1 said he would advise us of his exact
departure date in the-event we had any further instructions
for him, The meeting terminated at 1520 pours. There were
no incidences of a security nature to report. +
