Rafael Garcia-Bango Dirube

AWHIP-l was asked if he knew Garcia Bango (GB)

whom ve described as a lawyer, 33 years old, who had just

arrived in Madrid and claimed that he had a message

obviously coming from AULASH-1 or members of his group.

AJIHIP! replied that he knew GB who had been a friend

ANWHIP-1 stated

SEN 2b30, that Gi had been sent by the ANLASh group to 15-2

AUWITPI stated it was possible, but not

convey the message as indicated in the forementioned MADR

AMWHIP-I further stated he felt GB would be

personally loyal to AMLASH-l in spite of any DSE suggestion

to the contrary.

(This again is a feeling which AMWHIP-1

had and is not to be taken as gospel.)

He also mentioned

brother of GB, Jorge, on whom there are a number of

at Headquarters.

AHWHIP-l also discussed the contents of a letter

received from AULASH-2.

The essential part of this letter

plus a telephone call from ANLASH-3 from Madrid was that

ANLASH-3 was somewhat upset by the fact that he was having

difficulty in getting a visa for the U. S. and/or the

Dominican Republic.

ASWHIP-1 then spent considerable

tine discussing the treatment of AMLASH-2 and AMLASH-3 in

He said he felt that AULASH-2 and

ANLASH-3 should be contacted by KUBARK and treated and

handled well.

If this were done,

they would both serve a

very useful

purpose for KUBARK ends

both in Europe and in

Cuba.

The undersigned told AJWHIP-l that we essentially

agreed with his position and would take up the matter with

our superiors when we returned to Washington.

matter of the visa for AVLASH-3,

we pointed out that we

could not intercede for AULASH-3 in either case because it

would be compromising to him.

To illustrate

the point we

explained that both governments knew that AMLASH-3 was a

Captain in the Rebel Army and had up until recently been

working actively for a ministry of the Cuban Government

and therefore considered a Cuban official working in behalf

of the Castro Government.

As such ASILASII-3,

or anyone in

that position, would not be entitled to enter either country

under normal circunstances.

Re pointed out that theCuban

Government in all probability knew of this; and, if MMLASH-3

rather obvious indication to the Cuban

•AJILASH-3 must be cooperating with one or the other govern

A3WHIP-1 accepted the explanation and felt it

would be readily understandable and a good excuse to give

to AMLASII-3.

AMWHIP-I also talked at length on the subject of

ANBIDDY-1 and AMLASH-1.

AJILASH-I's plans, and that AMLASH-l himself was very

skeptical of the arrangement with ANBIDDY-l.

Furthermore,

as a result of this, he is somewhat unsure of his positior

vis-a-vis ODYOKE.

ANWHIP-] said he would advise us of his exac

departure date

in the event we had any further instructior

for him.

The meeting terminated at 1520 hours.

There were

no incidences of a security nature to report.
