From:

OPCA

(U) As mentioned previously, the JFKTF searches the

open and closed indices at Headquarters and reviews any files

identical with the subject for additional identifying personal

information. The JFKTF requests the field office to search their

indices,

review any identifiable documents and respond with the

appropriate information.

This information is forwarded to the

Butte Information and Technology Center (BITC) for their search of

the various data bases for current physical status, death record

or location.

The JFKTE provides this information to the ARRB to

support the FBI's request to sustain the postponement of names

and singular information.

Currently the ARRB releases the

identities and singular information on all sources with no

information available and those deceased. This includes sources

with foreign citizenship, which the BITC cannot search.

(U) The 33 documents concerning the decisions from the

current meeting, which the FBI may wish to appeal, are listed

below by, document number with the

information to be released. The

status of informants and sources, if found through research,

noted after the name with living (L), deceased (D), no record

(NR) or date of birth (DOB).

The FBI provided

written justifications presenting

the evidence

available to protect the individuals,

singular

information,

technical information, and classified information

related. to methods, sources and foreign relations as listed

However, the ARRB supports the position that the

information ordered disclosed is relevant and significant to the

assassination. They opine the pertinence and importance to the

assassination outweigh any current harm to the individuals or the

FBI's/United States Government's Foreign relations, informants,

or operational aspects.

(U) II CID OF NSD recommend appealing, please provide

the addendum with reasons to the JFKTF and OGC by 11/07/1996, as

the FBI only has 7 days to appeal upon receipt of the letter. If

you have any questions,

please contact Carol I. Keeley at

extension 9494 or Carl Valentine at extension 9476.

Additionally at this meeting, the ARRB agreed to

postpone the technical information concerning a surveillance on

Marina Oswald.

NSD reiterates that all FBI sources are given an

expressed promise of confidentiality. As explained above, not

only would the release of these informants' names violate

promise, it would also be detrimental to FBI future informant

development since the granting of confidentiality is paramount in

gaining a potential informant's confidence and cooperation.

Furthermore, the mass release of this many informants would set

precedent for releasing future informant identities and thus

severely hamper the FBI's ability to protect same. (NU)

In short, the supposed historical significance of the

release of the identity of these individuals posed by ARRB cannot

logically outweigh the potential danger to them or their

families. Once confidentiality is granted, the FBI is obligated

to protect the identity of bona fide sources and informants

absent

statements by them to the contrary. (U)

#23 thru #27 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal the

release of information that would release the code word

"Tumbleweed" and other information related to this double agent

operation. The use of assets in double agent operations is an

indispensable method used by the FBI to gain information from

persons affiliated with or having access to foreign intelligence

services.

The ability of the FBI to assure double agents that

the confidentiality of the relationship will be maintained is

required

to ensure future trust and cooperation by others. (S)

#28 and #32 - N$D recommends the FBI appeal the release

of information relating to FBI investigation of foreign

officials.

By letter dated January 26, 1996, the Department of

State advised that no documents related to the assassination

should be released if they constitute acknowledgement of

investigation of foreign diplomatic officials and establishments

in the United

In the Department's opinion, disclosure of

these counterintelligence investigations could have a significant

adverse effect on U.s. foreign relations. u

#29 thru #31, and #33 - NSD recommends the FBI appeal

the release information obtained from a technical surveillance of

the Dominican Republic, as well as information related to

contacts with the Soviet Embassy and information that would

reveal a mail cover on the Soviet Embassy.

As previously

articulated by the JFKTF, investigative methods and techniques

may vary in application,

but do not normally diminish in

importance with time. Public exposure of the FBI's above

investigative methods and techniques would cause harm to the

FBI's foreign counterintelligence capabilities. It would also

likely result in countermeasures against such coverages and thus

lessen their value. MU
