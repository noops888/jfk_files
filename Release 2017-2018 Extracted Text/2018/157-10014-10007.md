| at that time would still pertain.

Mr. Wallach. Mz, Angleton, on behalf of the Committee,
jet me express our appreciation on the record for your coming
back again. As you recall, I was present for a portion of the
testimony that you gave to Mr. Johnson on the Houston Plan, and

I still think for this session that the oath that was applied

Do you understand that you are still under oath?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. You know the regulations,

Mr. Wallach. In any event, you at that time were also !
given then, you were advised of your rights to counsel, etc. i

T take it, once again, by the fact that you have come without
counsel, that you have taken to waive that right.

Is that right?

Mr. Angleton. ‘That's right.

4x, Wallach. The subject matter that we'll be discussing |

here today primarily focuses upon the New York mail intercept

| Program that was run by the CIA for approximately 20 years.

I realize you've already given some testimony on this,

i both for the record, for the Commission, and briefly touched upon

it as a sidelight’to ur. Johnston's examination, and I will try as
best I can not to be repetitive. I, of course, have access

to the Rockefeller material and have read it, and we will try
again not to cover the same ground except insofar as I would like

to hit upon certain specifics that I don't believe we've gone

TOP SECRET



I also have some documents here I would like to show you
in varying degrees that will have to be read, and I think we can
| take them one at a time, and you will be given an adequate chancda
to read them, and should we reach a determination it is necessary
to do so, the minute there are any questions on them, we can
do that for each document.

Mr, Angleton, do you recall when you became aware that..therd

was.a mail intercept project in New York City?

TESTIMONY OF JAMES ANGLETON =~ Resumed

Mr. Angleton. I don't know the date, but I assume that I
learned of it through Herman Horton, who was my Deputy in 1954.

Mr. Wallach. At that time it was being run by the Office
of Security, is that correct?

Mr. Angleton. That's right.

Mr. Wallach. Did there come a point in time when the
operation was taken over, at least the substantive parts of the

operations as compared to the procedural and mechanical aspects

of gathering together and intercepting the mail, that this was
=
taken over by the CIA. staff?
Mr. Angleton. That's right.
Mr. Wallach, When was that, sir?

Mr. Angleton. Well, there is a chrono on this entire

thing. I think the best chrono is this report, if I can find

it in the Rockefeller Commission. '55, I believe, at the time.
Mr. Wallach. Is the document you are looking at now the
| attachment, prepared for the Rockefeller Commission and submitted
the day you testified there?
Mr. Angleton. That's right.
The time was 1955.
Mr. Wallach, Given that approximate time, Mr. Angleton,
| do you recall how the decision was reached that CIA.staff would
i
| cake over the project?

H
Mr. Angleton. Well, I think there was a question, I think

TOP SECRET



Prone (Area 202) 344-6000

é
:

there were a number of matters involved here. I think one of
them was that security was undergoing some kind of freeze.
Second, I believe the Division wanted out. I think there were
a combination of factors which led to the feeling on the part
of many that the program would be discontinued for lack of
funding and personnel. The other point is that Mr. Horton

had very close relationships with the Office of Security and

I assume they went to him on it because even though there is
memorandum by DiSilva to the effect that the project was not
to be used for counterintelligence purposes, that is very
unrealistic, because Mr. Timm, who put up the project, was
himself a counterintelligence officer. tle had been formerly
FBI, and then he was OSS counterintelligence during the war,
in fact his whole career was in a professional sense in counter-
intelligence. And I don't feel that the thrust of it was
entirely positive intelligence in his mind.

I knew him extremely well.

Further, there was, which I have not seen reflected in
the papers I have read, the security was very much involved
operationally in terms of penetration of the Agency in
security cases, and this goes back to the post-Oss period,

at least after the war when I was abroad, and there were a lot

i of hearings on penetration of OSS, and this was supported by

some very highly sensitive documentation, Soviet in nature, to

the extent of penetration and security were charged with this

TOP SECRET

leet, S.£.,Wasnington, ©.C. 20003

problem of trying to clean out the combination of Communist
Party members, probably Soviet intelligence, and also known
homosexuals which also were in the counter-intelligence side.
So, I think that what the record does not reflect is that
there were very strong counter-intelligence stressed by the

very people who, in a sense, played a part in the originating

lef the entire program.

_And I find that conflict with,as I say, Disilva or Doran,
Dawa Dwromd?
Dan Doran, or he stated or made some comment that it should
not be a -- it was not for counter-intelliyence purposes, that
it was entirely misleading.

And in the penetration part of it, of the problems con-

fronting security, Mr. Horton had much to do with that as well

las Mr. O'Neal. In other words, there was a very firm

relationship going back into all of the other kinds of cases.
Mr. Wallach. I'm not entirely sure I understand, when
| you talk about the Office of Security at that time probably

| continually being occupied with penetration, how that would

| afgect their handling the project. Are you talking strictly
I!

| about manpower, because it is my understanding that project

still took up a heck of a lot of time for the Office of
Security in terms of manpower.

are you talking about manpower down at Headquarters?

Mr. Angleton. No. I only saw and noticed the effect that

in one of Herman’s memos which he drafted, he talked about the

TOP SECRET



freeze in Security, the fact that Security were hamstrung
personnel, etc, and starting out in '55, the staff having

pulled together in '64, we did have a lot of slots and we

prone (Aras 202) 544-6000

a lot of latitude,,that it would be very natural in terms of
jjthe associations for someone to put up to the staff for taking
away the project.

Mr. Wallach, This might be kind of:a hypothetical that I'm
going to pose, but if you really don't feel that you can give an
answer on it, just let me know.

For example, if Security had continued with the project,
would they have had the expertise to really do anything with it
|besides really straight, positive intelligence? I think you may |
have suggested that, that there was sort of a natural gravitation

Ito CI staff once it developed.

Py
é
Fa

Mr. Angleton, Yes, I think there was a natural gravitation!
i

I think the Security's interest,, they would have been able to

I
; handle, but it would have been a very small slice of the project.
!

iIn other words, theirs would have only been personnel, and then, |
in correspondence within Agency people, and Soviet units and
iso on.

Mr. Wallach. I would like at this time, Mr. Angleton, to
show you a document that I will just ask’ the Reporter to subse-
quently mark as Angleton Exhibit 1 for identification of
this date. It is --,I am not actually sure whether it is

Mr. Angleton. I have a this. It ig a fairly involved
MEMO .

Mr. Wallach, The reason I said not to look at it thoroughly|
is there are a lot of facts and figures that we'll be going into,
but do take a look at it.

Mr. Angleton, Well, if you want to call my attention to
any specifics in it.

Mr, Wallach. Well, just take a quick look through and I'll

call your attention to a couple of specifics.

My first question was going to be whether or not you

recall this before. In fact, there is some handwriting on I

| guess the third page and fourth page, and I wonder if that is

yours.

Mr. Angleton. No. No, I don't recognize it. It might have

Bad,

i
| been Bert O'Neal's. I'm not sure.

Mr. Wallach. But in any event, you believe you at least
saw this document at some point in time.

Mr. Angleton. I have seen it, certainly after, you know,
recently, but this is apparently a draft, is it not? It is a
draft document?

Mr. Wallach. Does it say that on it? Why do you say
apparently?

Mr. Angleton, Well, it woulda't be a document with all

lof these cortections on it.

Mr. Wallach. We are unable to determine if we got it from

TOP SECRET



an individual's file or not, or if someone just may have made
comments on it or crossed things out after they received it.

Mr. Angleton. No, no, This thing looks as though it had
gone from one party to another.

Mr, Wallach. I agree. For example, on page 6 there are
portions crossed out and additions made.

Mr. Angleton. It looks very much like a paper that was
|cun through a staffing process.

Mr. Wallach. In any event, we haven't found a final
version, if there is one. So this is all we have to work from
| at this time.

I don't think I'll have any questions. on the portions that

| are crossed out or handwritten in.

Mr. Angleton. The language is very much like O'Neal's.’

| Every "i" is dotted and every "t" is crossed.

Mr. Wallach. When the project was taken over by CI staff,

7422999; :1 456

was it then a mail opening project or was it just a mail inter-
; cept mail cover project?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I really don't know. It could have been
both, It could have been in the process of changing, but I had
a feeling that openings had been taking place before.

But the paragraph 5 which I am looking at now -

access, etc., for exterior examination. It is possible,
discretely to gain exclusive access to the contents of a limited

number of selected communications, and I think that seus to

|be at variance with some other: paper I have also seen.

I thought an earlier part, that openings were taking place.

Mr. Wallach. Are the documents you're looking at now

|| copies of documents that went into the Rockefeller Commission?

Nr. Angleton. No. I got it froma fellow. I haven't

examined it.
. Wallach. From whom?

Mr. Angleton, From the project -- no, not the project
but one of the men who's still back on the staff.

Mr. Wallach: Mr. Tsikerdanos?

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

(Pause)

Mr. Wallach. While Mr. Angleton is looking through the

documents I would like to explain, going a bit into the

' Rockefeller Commission, that there is some question as to
i whether or not there was ever explicit authorization in terms

dof switching from a mail intercept, mail cover to a mail

opening project.

Mr. Angleton. I understand the question.

Mr. Wallach. But I think a couple of later documents
suggest that -~ well, I will let Mr. Angleton finish looking

through the documents that he has.

TOP SECRET



Mr. Angleton. Well, I just want to see if I can see this
to find anything --

(Pause)

Mr. Wallach, In one of the documents there is reference
to the fact that openings have been going on for some time. I
think that is a year after this document, I think it is a '56 ~
document that that is in.

Mr. Angleton. Well, this is so repetitious that --

(Pause)

In '53, December, they are discussing this, saying we
now wish to carry out the second step of this arrangement, and
that is to photograph the fronts and backs of first class mail.

Mr. Wallach, I think the first step there just might have

been a survey to see how much mail came in and out.

Are those documents entirely related to the New York
| project, Mr. Angleton?

Mr. Angleton. Either that or collateral.

Mr. Wallach. Do you have any objection to letting us take
a look at them?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I would rather leave that to the
Agency. I was supposed to see the General Counsel and I have not
been able to get a hold of him,

Hr, Wallach, I don't understand what seeing the General
Counsel -~

Mr. Angleton,. Well, I mean, I was supposed to get the

guidelines for appearing here.

Mr. Wallach. You mean even before your appearance last

week?
Mr. Angleton. Yes. And they were all tied up.

Mr. Wallach. I just think for the purposes of examination

I/t would like to go on your memory. You have been over the

subject before.
Mr. Angleton, I mean, I don't recall the first time they

were actually opened, whether it was with us, I was under the |
i
|
impression that there had been something going on in the opening;
but there wasn't very much because there wasn’t much personnel

i

and they didn't have the people to process. In other words,

that is my impression, that there had been opening. In November!

of '55 there is a statement that the only added function that

would be formed by Security in the new project is that more
letters will be opened, the. implication being that letters were
being opened.

They are presently able to open only a very limited number

Under the new setup, with full time employees, Security will

| be able to obtain the addressor, addressees and total correspon-

dence ayainst approximately 75 percent at the. present time.

So, I mean, if that sentence is correct, then it means

| that the letters were being opened, and that the only thing

one of the changes would be that more letters would be

opened.

Mr. Wallach. 1 think ar find the docunentsido not
pin down a specific date for the authorization of the actual
beginning of the Project. I think it may, in fact, have
happened -- the interceptors ‘may have begun to do it themselves
and then the Agency responding, it says, well, it looks like

we can do it. But I wag wondering what your actual recollection

| was. I realize it's twenty-odd years ago.

Mr. Angelton. Well, it isn't quite that. 4 mean, 1 take
full responsibility for everything, but I really didn't spend
that much time in this business, and what I am really trying
to say is Mr. Horton, who was my Deputy, was the one who
detailed, go through all of this negotiating, and so on.

Mr. Wallach. I'd just like to make it clear that I'm

| not really here to assess Yesponsibility or pedal like that.

All I'm trying to do is -get your memory as to --
Mr. Angleton. Well, I mean my point being that almost

everything I know about the origins of the mail have been from

December of last year on in terms of going back through all

| these little papers.

Mr. Wallach. In other words, aside from your raview of
the documents of Dacamber On, you really have no indepandent
recullection of that time Period?

Mr. Angleton. No. My impression is that the documents
were being opened, but on a very small scale, due to Personnel

and due to the procedural set up. Thay didn't have the

interpreters, they didn't have the substantive people who could
spot. In other words, it was a very poor program in terms of
exploitation.

Mr. Wallach. You mean they didn't have the interpreters
or the substantive people?

Mr. Angleton. Well, they didn't have them in the sense
that we later had people devoted entirely to this project.

Mx. Wallach. Well, without getting into that, you're
talking about people back at Headquarters or people at the
intercept point?

Mr. Angleton. No, at the Headquarters. I mean there were f
not.files built up, as I recall.

Mr. Wallach. Now I think in your other dates you are

correct.

Mr. Angleton. And it took a lot of trial and error to
finally get through from handwritten files to punchcard to
machine tapes.

Mr. Wallach. I think the figures which I'm sure you've
seen which were compiled in January of this year show some
12,000 documents or letters being opened in 1954 which surprised:
me when I saw these figures, because I hadn't thought it was
anywhere near that. I thought the 832 from 1956 was correct,
and I think that 12,000 may be in the wrong column.

But in any event, do you see the 12,000 I'm referring

Mr. Angleton. Yes, I do.

Unless that was supposed to take up all the mail that had
ever been opened prior to that, I don't know. Because it's
not responsive to the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 up above,

Mr. Wallach. Well, I don't think there's any explanation
as to what that figure means.

Mr. Angleton. I can find out, because I talked to Mrs.

Metzen last night, and she has her fingertips on practically

| everything-on tha project.

Mr. Wallach. That is

Mr. Angleton, Yes.

Mr. Wallach. Well, why don't wa go back through this
document at hand, and for the time being, forego this question?

Mr. Angleton. All right.

(Pause)

I think I can finally answer to that, I would think,
without any trouble from her. Has she been asked the question?

Mr. Wallach, No, I don't believe she has.

Mr. Angleton. And the other person who would know would
be Scotty Miler.

Mr. Wallach. What was Scotty Miler's position at this
time, as of 1955, do you recall?

Mr. Angleton. If I recall correctly, he was working with

Bertram O'Neal on Special Investigations, which was a unit

closely tied in with the .Office of Sacurity.

a
The primary task was the penetration of the Agency and
the government and historical penetration cases are recruitment
of U.S. officials in positions, code clerks. It had a very
tight filing system of its.own, and it was the only component
in the counterintelligence that had access to the security

files and the personnel maintained by the Office of Security.

jl And he was either the Deputy or one of the principal officers

Mr. Wallach. I realize that in your testimony before the

penetration of the Agency, and other things, and I think that

on the beginnings of the operation, as you explained, and I
don't want to lose sight of that in turning to this memorandum

but for example -- and again, I'm only asking if there were

on the first page in Section 3, under “Situations,” says:

with that problem.

Mr. Angleton. All rightin wu-y

Mr. Wallach. And all I'm trying to get from you is if
you recall any discussions at that time as to whether -- about
the subject and about the fact that there is no legal monitoring
By that, I take it they mean opening or showing, whatever they
mean by monitoring the mails.

Do you recall discussions about the legality
entering into this?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I read a lot about this sinca, but

T don't think I ever participated in any of the meetings dealing)

Mr, Angleton. I read about it since. I mean, I read all’
of these papars which go into the whole legal business.

Mr. Wallach. But I, from reading the documents that we

j| have, and the: Agency, has told me for all intents and purposes

that is what they have. I do not see any papers which reflect i

up to Helms and the Director going to the Postmaster General
and all of that.

Mr. Wallach. That was in 1971.

Mr. Angleton. Well, “they. ‘went. = much earlier than that.
I mean, back in the ‘50's.

Mr. Wallach, Well, Mr. Dulles did go to Mr. Halma, 1
think back in '54 to meet with the then-Postmaster General
but I don't think the record shows that the Postmaster General

was briefed on the fact that there was going to be any mail

/ openings.

Mr. Angleton. I mean, to me, I think there was a lot of
dispute on whether he was briefed about it,

Mr. Wallach. You think there was dispute about whether
Mr. Summerfield was briefed in the 1950's, or Mr. nay in ‘61.

Mr. Angleton. Both.

Mr. Wallach. In any event -- was Mr. Dulles aware, to the

best of your knowledge, that mail was being opened in New

| York?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. I don't think I ever saw

any detailed piece of paper on any of these visits.. Well, they

| were all kind of short.

Mr. Wallach. I think I'll have a memorandum later that
may cast some doubt as to whether Mr. Dulles was aware the
mail was being opaned.

Do you remamber discussing it with him?

TOP SECRET



Mr. Angleton. I don't remember discussing it with any

Director outside of Helms.

Mr. Wallach. In other words, you would not know then if

Mr. McCone was aware, for example?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. I mean -- let me put it this
way. I don't think anyone tried to withhold anything from
Mr. McCone. Just being sort of an impression that he himself
was disturbed that people didn't tell him, and I think it is
not realistic in terms of the way he ran the business.

Mr. MeCone was an individual who had a lot of experience in
government and he had a personal style of his own. Me lived

| by the record. Nis interest in the business was almost
exclusively devoted to items which were subject matters for
the Cabinet. In other words, it didn't matter how mundane a
program would be, as long as it was Cabinet-level, he went into
it in the most exhaustive fashion. He did not deal with the
case officers down the line.

In one case which I was handling with him, he read not
i only my analysis and so on. He read all of the attachments
down into the interrogations, and whatnot. In other words,
| the actual data.

Onca he had discharged that as a Cabinet mattar, it then
reverted back way down into the bowels of the organization,
| and six months later there might be a glimmer of this come
pack again and he would update himself in the intervening

TOP SECRET



prone (Are + 202) 544-6000

410 First Street, S.€., waunnaton, 0.€. 20009

period. And that is the way he ran the Agency. He was not

daterested in a lot of gratuitous matters dealing, say, with

j)mail intercepts or so on. If there had been mail intercept

which involved the penetration high in the government, T can

assure you it would have gone to him.

Mr. Wallach. Did Mr. Helms run the Agency in a different

| fashion?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I mean, I am just talking about Mr.
McCone. He was a very unusual man in the sense of how he ran
the Agency. He depended very directly on basically two men,

one was Ray Cline and the other was Dick Helms, plus his Exec

t
i Officer, and you know, some of the people around his immediate

office. But I am just saying to put it in prover perspective,
there was no one withholding from Mr. McCone anything, and

I think there were many of them who would give a great deal to
go up and talk about mundane problems.

Mr. Wallach. Well, just going back again to Mr. Dulles,
tha record does reflect that in 'S4 ha did go over with Mr.
Helms and meet with Mr. Summerfield, and I think the record
also shows that at that time in ‘54, at least, it was a mail
intercept project in the sensa that the mail was just being
photograph or transliterated, the covers of the mail. It was
not being opened.

The only point I was really trying to get at was Mr.

Dulles was -- it's not really clear whether or not and I'm not

saying anybody was hiding anything from him, that he ever found

out that the operation changed.

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. I don't know.

Let's put it this way. I don't thihk the project ever had
any caveat of not informing the Director of any piece of
intercept which had broad implications and should be brought to
his attention. I mean that's almost automatic, and it goes
for all kinds of collection.

Mr. Wallach. Do you recall instances of bringing the
product. to the attention of various Directors?

Mr. Angleton. Well, basically, Mr. Helms, because of a lot
of things dealing with civil unrest in that period, about a

fugitive from justice, the making of bombs, things of this

i sort.

Mr. Wallach. Was this when he was DDP?

Mr. Angleton. No, he was Director.

Mr. Wallach. Director.

There's one other part I'd like to talk to you about and

really get your opinion on in a second. In the next page >f

‘| this memorandum, it states that "It must be assumed that foreign

espionage agents have relied on this policy of the United

| states government" -- by that, it is referring to the policy
if
| of, there's no legal opening or monitoring of mails -- “and

this has resulted in extensive use of the mail for intelligence

purposes to our detriment."

SE. Wasninaton, O.€.

What I would like to get at is if it is your believe that

this is really true, or was true then, and did it subsequently

change, or do you think it is still true that there is that

reliance on the protection, you know, the privacy of the
mails?

Me. Angleton. I think there was up to the time that it
became exposed.

Mr. Wallach. What you're saying then is you do not
believe the Soviets knew we were conducting this program?

Mr. Angleton. Personally I don't think they did, but I

| mean, that is purely a personal view on it, Of course, they

would have known if there had been any penetration, but I mean,

| aside from that, I don't think they necessarily knew of it,

because after all, you had a number of exchange students usind
the mails and in their system, no one travelling outside can
get either a passport or a-valida as foreign exchange who
jen't processed by the intelligence organs as to his possible
usage, and particularly those scientific schools, and so on.
And also a lot of it is preparation for them for future jobs
on the American or the British desk.

tn fact, I would assume that they probably spent several
hundred thousand manhours going back through all the cases
and files and doing analysis to see what came through the
mails.

Mr, Wallach. Was it your understanding, then, at least ar

this tima that the project would only pick up mail where either
the addressee or the sendar was a Soviet?

Mr. Angleton. No, I think it was all communications that
came out of the Soviet Union and went into it. A lot of the
mail was actually sent by third nationals here.

In other words, you will find somebody's brother, maybe fron

or a cousin or a relative and you've got a lot of Latin American
mail, people who are relatives, friends or associates in some

group that they're studying here in the United States communica-

Mr. Wallach. Turning again to what you said and was

i thoroughly described in your attachment to the Rockefeller

Report is the tenor of the times that existed then. I think

in reading that and then looking at paragraph 6 of this

memorandum which deals with security and subparagraph (c) which
‘ i

is on page 7, which reads: "In tha event of compromise of the
aspect of the project involving internal monitoring of mails,
serious public reaction in the United States would probably
occur. Concaivably, pressures would be placed on Congress to
inquire into such allegations, but it is believed that any
problems arising could he satisfactorily handled.”

What I'm trying to get at is, given that tenor of the times:
it would surprise me that you would still believe there would

be serious public reaction to finding out about this program.

Mr. Angleton. Whoever drafted that had great prescience.
I mean, I do not know who drafted it, but they turned out to
be right.

Mr. Wallach. Well, I think it turned out to be right in
1975, but I am very truthfully too young to appreciate what
was going on back at that time, and I, from talking to many
people at the Agency, have kind of got a different opinion,
sort of all explained to me-very:thoroughly the tenor of the
times that existed then and that different outlooks, certain

pressures from President Eisenhower on penatration of the

intelligence community, and then a lot of other concerns that --

i Senator McCarthy and other things.

I was surprised to see that in 1955 someone fairly high

' up in the then-young CI staff would have felt that there would

| be serious public reaction to some disclosure of this, you

know, it was for intelligence purposes, and you know, that

surprised ma. And I was just wondering if you could possibly

! recall if you would have thought that back than.

Mr. Anglaton. Now don't -- I can't really say ona way or
the other, and I have not gotten in touch with Herman Horton.
I believe I had an afternoon with him, and a lot of things

became much clearer, I msan, all the meetings and the people

that he saw.

Mr. Dick. For what period of time was Mr. Horton your

Mr. Angleton. I have it somawhere here.

He started with me when I took over the Counterintelligence
Staff. He ‘thad'been-in the FBI and then he had been with the
Agency -~ ‘I'meany ‘the OSS.

He had also been a lawyer. When he started, he was well

cup on Federal statutes.

I cannot put my hands on it right now, but I have all the
dates.

Mr. Wallach. Well, I think maybe then we can just check
it with the Agency if you don't have it right here.

Mr. Angleton. No.

Mr. Wallach. One other general aspect I'd like to talk

to you on which is reflected in the memorandum, and there is

| no reason now to go over it, is the oft.reseated statement here |

that the security factors require no disclosure whatever be

i made to any persons or organizations outside the CIA. And I

“was wondering, at that. time -~ and I realize there were certain
' problems that existed later on between the CIA and the FBI,
| and we will qo into then in the '58 events by which the CIA

i
or the FBI became informed of the project, but I was wondering

why, for example, this would not have been thought of as a

| project that would have been very useful to the FRI at that

time, and the FBI also at least brought into the project, or

some sort of joint project. Was that just somathing that
didn't happen ahd then you just realized later on that it
didn't happen?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think that the relations with the
Tear were very spotty, leading up to '54...When DaLo&ch: was: the
Liaison Officer there ware a number of ‘problems and there was
also a very strong feeling by Mr. Hoover about CIA man who had
|| been former FBI people. There wasn't-somithing generated out of
the CI Staff. It was one that probably went back since Eric Tim
was FBI, Bill Harvey was FBI. We stole a number of FBI people
and it wasn't the best of relations

Mr. Wallach, Have you been, or are you aware today, of
the various projects, mail intercepts and mail opening projects
| that were conducted by the Bureau since World War II in the

United States?

Mr. Angleton. No. I am aware of the fact that there

; Were, from time to time. I mean there, operationally, were

matters that would come up, whether we would get a certain mail |

coverage.

Mr. Wallach. Are you aware, for example, of continual

projects from 1946 through 1966 of various foreign establishments

in the U.S. run by tha Bureau, and this is not something that

i
it was existing in '55, but there are no Bureau records that would

reflect that anybody at the CIA was made aware of it until |

approximately '61.
Mr. Angleton. No, I think anything wa've done regarding

FBI coverage came out of the counterintelligence reports of

pmone (Ares 202) 544-6000

the case that was broken and the surveillance and whatnot,
and after all, you'd learn how to read those reports and know
more or less where the sources are from.

Mr. Wallach. I think we've gotten thersare’ type ofttestimony,
from other people.

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Wallach. In other words, after reading it, and from
your experience, you can tall this was gotten from mail

treatment.

Mr. Wallach. What do you mean by that?

Mr. Angleton. We were covering a vast amount of mail;
the Bureau's interest was more or less ‘pinpointed on matters
that came as a result of a breakthrough or identification of
some active case. That is at least my understanding of how
they operate.

Mr. Wallach. Did the Bureau, at any time, stop sending
the CIA intelligence reports on cases and things, the ones
you. described?

Mr. Wallach. We'll go off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Wallach, I think we. can go pack on the record. I
think the record can reflect that when we went off the record,
Mr. Angleton went into one or two specific cases and just a
further explanation of his reasons why there was not -the best
of cooperative worlds between the Agency and the Bureau in the
early '50s.

I would like now to sHow you a document which I would
like marked as Angleton Exhibit 2 for our identification, and
it's a two page document, it's a memorandum for Acting
beputy Director of Plans. It's from Mr. Angleton, and there's
a date on it that's not entirely legible, but it isa ‘56
document.

Mr. Angleton, Does it show the drafter of the document?

Mr. Wallach. Well, let me show it to you, Mr. Angleton.

(Pause)

Mr. Angleton. No, it's not signed by me; it's signed by

j my Deputy for me, if you look at that. |

Mr. Wallach. Right. You are correct in that.

I'm not going to have any specific questions on it

| put what I'd like to do is focuse’ your attention on the second

paragraph for a minute which goes to the question about

ur, pulles' knowledge of the mail opening aspect of it.



I'm not saying anything was held back from him, There
it says the Director approved the undertaking in principle in

its initial stages in May 1954, and took steps which have,

Prone (Ares 202) 544-6000

through a developmental stage, resulted in a formulation of
the program and its approval by yous.

Now, looking at that language, back in 1954, the CI staff
was not involved, and the records seem ‘to reflect that, at least
in '54, that there may have just been isolated instances of
mail opening, but it was really a mail screening, mail cover
project. From this it looked like Mr. Helms himself approved
the HTLINGUAL aspects of it, and the CI staff, when they came, |
there was probably mail opening before, but it was more formalized.

Now, I guess it would be more appropriate to ask Mr.

i i who brought up the proposal.

Mr. Angleton. It does not illuminate for me at all.

Mr. Wallach. Okay.

what I'm really, as you're aware, trying to get at is the

procedural part of it, not at the question of responsibility or
anything like that, as to a project that Mr. Dulles, you know,

may have first briefed Mr. Summerfiold on as a mail opening

project sort of turned into that. le may or may not have been
informed, possibly because he never asked, not because anybody
withheld anything.

Mr. Angleton, Well, he would have been told the details
because he wouldn't have gone there unless he had interrogated

Nr. Wallach, But my statement is he went up there in early’
'54 and at that time we don't really have a mail opening project
as such.

Mr. Angleton. Well, I mean, that's what I have not been able to &

i find here, whether this is -- let me just see if this throws
Wany light on it.

Now, going back here, and this is just-an aside, but this
reflects that Dana Doran, who was head of the Soviet Division,

Mr. Angleton. Yes, it's one of the summaries.

Mr. Wallach. Well, I really don't think that we should
dwell on that point.

Hr. Angleton, Well, I am trying to boil this down to a

little more perspective, to see whether there is any indication

when the mail was opened.

Mr. Wallach. I think we can get a clearer indication of that

can you tell me in the early days, I'm talking '55, '56,
"57, the fifties, how really the project was set up at Head-
quarters in terms, was there any project staff as existed in the
later years?”

Mr. Angleton. Yes, there was a group of about six people.

I don't think it went above six. They handled Russian, Yiddish, '

Spanish, German, French, and these different skills were divided

up among the six people who were known as the CI Project, and

their purpose was simply to analyze the correspondence that

|| was opened, write a digest, and then there would be cleared

people within certain branches, geographic branches in the

division who were recipients, and their job was to fuse or

meld it with their own activities and to hopefully refine the

watch list. In other words, they would levy requirements or

| indicate that such and such was of no interest.

Mr. Wallach. You said levy requirements. They would ask
for ‘a particular person to be placed on the watch list, and
if any mail came either to or from that person -~

Mr. Angleton. That's right.

Me. Wallach. It would be intercepted.

Mr. Angleton. And then when they finish with the Xerox,
a copy of the digest would be sent back to this group where it
was destroyed, periodical destruction,

But they maintained a copy which was first carded

it went to a tape, the control of which we maintain a computer

Mr. Wallach. What instructions were actually given to the

Office of Security intercept officers who actually picked up

i the mail and opened it and then sent it down to Neadquarters?

Mr. Angleton. Well, they were given, they were told what
was of interest and what was not, and I think they had a watch
list, and there was one individual who was fairly sophisticated

and had a great deal of experience in this field and he,

| together with the watch list, could make a fairly accurate

| coverage of the mail.

Mr. Wallach, Is that you're referring to?

or the: actual people who were picking up the mail.

of it.

because the people in the project, I've heard them say

it couldn't have been done without him.

Mr. Wallach. Is that because of his facility in Russian?

Mr. Angleton, Well, and his general perceptions. I mean,
how he could himself interpret the envelopes and the addressees
and so on.

Mr. Waliach., Well, a good percentage of the mail that
went back two and from the Soviet Union was, at least from the
Soviet Union, was propaganda.

Mr. Angleton, That's right.

Mr. Wallach. And I believe that --

Mr. Angleton. Well,“ there was a big interest in government
at one time on suppressing propaganda mail. I don't know what
happened, but it goes way back. My recollection is, I don't
| even know whether the mail was in fact suppressed, I mean, the
j propaganda mail.

to make a cursory review of the types of mail that was coming

couldn't have been done without It scems that if

Mr. Angleton, Well, I don't think that is correct.

Scotty Miler and }and another lady who was there

were very much on top of this mail business, and also on the
requirements. In other words, they had a very strong voice in
what was sent to the various branches and divisions, and had
a lot to do with the screening of requests for coverage and
fit it into their activity.

Maybe I just don't understand your answer, but it seems that

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think that this may reflect the

entirely ignorant of all this, and this is again the kind of

quéstion which I cannot get a response to. I have a feeling

that we were handling much of this as we would communications

the case of this material, assuming that there was something of
great importance that was turned up.

Mr. Wallach. Once again what you're stating, it was

recall, two different stories, one that the Bureau contacted

the Postal authorities and were told to see CIA, and another
one in which the Postal authorities contacted the CIA to say
the Bureau wants to get into the same field. And anyway, the
decision was made the Bureau had to be cut in.

Mr. Wallach. In Mr. Belmont's memorandum -- and I under-

3 the coverage -- the sole purpose of the New York operation's

" coverage was to identify persons behind the Iron Curtain who

i might have some ties in the U.S. and who could be approached in

their countries as contacts and sources for CIA,

Is that your understanding of the sole purpose of the
operation?

Mr. Angleton. Well, I think the basics are simply that

to a large extent in the west, I mean, there are many western
services that do have rather complete counterintelligence

{in terms of exsight and insight into Soviets who were traveling

So that I think that by way of counterintelligence weapons
outside of communications intelligence, and there's practically
little or none of that for the time being, that it was’ probably
most important overview that Counterintelligence had. It was
also an overview, and we were very active in propaganda in all

@ifferent forms, the Cord: Meyer operations and so on, And

lit had the specific cases, going back into the period of

civil strife and whatmot, it was the only source of information
in those cases,

And I think you've seen the requirements which the Bureau
levied, and again, it was the only source of information which
the FBI ever had in those subjects.

Mr. Wallach, That is assuming that the Bureau did not
its own project.

Mr. Angleton. I mean, in spite of all of that, this

was documentation, you know, where it differs, I mean, it

| goes up to the top of the class in the sense of grading the

" bona fides of the sources and information next to Communications

Intelligence; if the opposition does not know it, then the
mail becomes an extremely important source of very high level
information. I mean, it's factual.
ur. Wallach. May I take you one step further on that?
Would there be any benefit to an operation like this
if we had, for example, back in '51 Congress had passed a

specific statute and said in certain circumstances the CIA can

Prone (Area 202) 544-6000

open mail, and the Soviets would have known that the CIA could
possibly have done that, and let's say today we passed that
legislation. I think you can understand what I'm getting at

Now, would that have any benefit in just reviewing, I

think probably less benefit, if there was any benefit, but of
v

having that kind of statute in narrowly prescribed circumstances,
it could be entirely held secret, you know, possibly given
the approval of the President or whatever, if there was different
types of legislation, because I don't believe it now exists --
that it would be of any benefit.
Imean, I. think this is ‘one of the questions that academia --
Mr. Angleton. Well, personally, I am too close to these

inquiries to be very objective on what if because my own personal

view is that, you know, counterintelligence and the work on 7
the Bloc in large measure has been destroyed by these hearings.
That's my personal view.

Ycannot see a Soviet defector coming over to the United
States, so to speak, in a sense committing suicide, I don't
think that agents who are high level agents are going to have
anything to do with the Agency for a great deal of time with
all of these exposures. I think the Soviets have had very
high level discussions and conferences regarding how they can
exploit this period to achieve the maximum benefits for
themselves.

I think they will probably run a damage report on what

TOP SECRET



mone (Ares 202) $44-6000

410 Furst Street, S.€., Wasnington, 0.¢. 20003

they have uncovered through

how it affected their operations. I would also say they probably
put a tremendous number of agents on ice in order to avoid-any
type of a reaction.

For example, I mean, they've done it in the past when they'
been in a period of crisis, where there's been a crisis in the
West, they have put agents on ice in order to avoid any kind of |
political scandal.

Mr. Wallach. You're seeing some sort of a backlash in the

+S.?

Mr. Angleton. ‘That type of thing, but after the Gozenko
cases up in Canada for ten years there was a type of prohibition!

on operations in Canada because of the impact in Canada politi- |
'

cally that that had in many areas of the world, and these were

conscious decisions that they arrived at.

Now, I think any of them saying, what has happened to the

i
U.S. intelligence community, that the.only people they would make

use of would be agents of influence, and find another way of
putting water on the wheel without themselves becoming directly
implicated. I think this would be the normal direction of any
adversary service, when it sees that somebody else is doing
the job for then.

Se going back to this basic question that you have asked,
I think there may have been in the '50s an opportunity to

have influenced the Congress to have some kind of bills passed

that would have aided the investigative agencies on the problem
of espionage. Other countries do have it.

but our General Counsel -- and I am not speaking authori-
tatively here -- it is my impression is that one of our weak-
nesses is that we did not have the General Counsel work into

the planning phases of operations, Usually we went to the

il ceneral Counsel when something was going wrong, but not in the

inception of operations. If there had been much more of that,

that type of consultation of things being originated, then a

| General Counsel might have been able to cure a number of these

programs by proposing types of legislation.
Now, this was not done. How I think it is too late. I

don't think the mood of the country would support that type of

; | legislation.

Me, Wallach. Are you saying it's too late because of the
mood of the country or too late for practical reasons?
ur. Angleton. No, I think it is the mood of the country

involved some government documents which have fallen into the
hands of the opposition, for a number of years they would take
those documents and then falsify either a cover letter of an
American official to another official, and float that document

in the third world, And the attachments would be bona fide.

the thrust of the entire operation was disinformation, total
fabrication.

We could identify in our holdings the American documents

| which were authentic, the attachments. When we tried to work

on the case, and even coming to the original recipients, it ran
into over 800 names or more, without going down to all of the

yeroxes that were made of those documents, or all of the people

who were not listed as recipients in different offices.

on the Soviet side, if there is a leakage, they can pinpoint

| very rapidly that there were only two ox three people who knew

the secret, and that one of them was in the west. 50 the problet:

‘
that they have in terms of filling in the holes are relatively

simple under their system, because they have every bigot list

in terms of the need to know. So if there is a leakage, as
there was in one of our biggest cases, the Popov case, which was
the speech of Zhukov in Germany, and immediately it centered or

focused attention on our agent, and that document went through

ii the hands of George Blake in Berlin. So all he did was tell

his case officer, Soviet, that he saw the speech, a copy of tiv

Mr. Wallach. And I have a couple of documents here that 1

But, for example, and there are a couple of specific questions 1;

In the second paragraph of this, the Ic report annex

Sense because it was never processed through the approval

system and has no separate funds." And ther it goes on to

explain that the various components involved have been carrying
out the responsibility as a part of their normal staff functions ;

And really, all I want to get is an understanding of what

Mr. Angleton. Well, the approval System would have meant

that this would have had to go to a great number of components

who would have to sign off on it, and it would receive tremendou$

Mr. Wallach, That, at least to me, seems the opposite

y of a highly sensitive operation.

Mr. Angleton. Yes, more or less. When a project is
conceived, it might cut accoss many jurisdictions to begin with,
I mean different geographic divisions and so on, so there would
have to be a signoff by the various components, and then it woul
go before a project review board, which again the members would
be drawn from many parts of the clandestine services, and I
mean, you would have this tremendous opening up of the activity
to a great number of people,

Mr. Wallach, But it would just seem to me -- obviously

ny knowledge of the Agency is limited -- that this would entirel

| be, you know, again kind of totally against the grain of any

ig
sort of need to know concept
Are you saying it is not because the components usually

involved would have some need to know?

Mr. Angleton. No. Because of the fact that it invol.

Security, it involved ourselves, in the SA Division, and since

the Director and everybody concerned were so familiar with it

it was very easy to exempt it from the project system,

Mx. Wallach. Who would make a determination as to what
could be exempted and what could not be exempted?

Mr. Angleton. Oh, the Deputy Director probably could. 1

numbered six on page 3. It states, "The principal guidance
furnished to the interception team is the watch list of names
compiled by the CI Staff. The names may be submitted by the
SR Division, the FBI, CI Staff, and the Office of Security.
The list is revised quarterly to remove names no longer of
interest, and it ranges between 300 or 400 names." And then
it just goes on and states, "leadquarters has prepared the
actual watch list intercepts with the photographs of all
exteriors. There has not yet been a case of a watch list item
having been missed by intercéptors. Of total items opened,

about one third are on the watch list and the others are

selected at randon. Over the years, however, the interceptors

have developed a sixth sense or intuition, and many of the names;

on the watch list were placed there as a result of interest
created by the random openings.

"RA limited amount of guidance is given in the specific
area of topical requirements, but this is not very satisfactory.
The interception team has to rely largely on its own judgment
in the selection of two thirds of the openings, and it should

have more first hand knowledge of the objectives and plans of

Mr. Angleton. Well I was never aware that anyone in the

I have not, to my knowledge, I've never seen this report. The
only thing I've ever seen on it is a memorandum that starts off
something about the IG report, and it got into the whole question

of the cover story.

Staff had about 30 people working on it full time?

Mr. Wallach. I don't know. ’ think we probably should
ask him that. It would seem at least from’some of the figures
he has here that he would have at least have attempted to talk
to somebody in CI about a project that was run by CI Staff.

Mr. Wallach. And I believe that these are two memoranda

regarding the cover story for the project that Mr. Angleton had
| referred to before.

Mr. Angleton, Let me just see if I have a memo here which
says where §t.originated at.

Mr. Wallach. I think your memorandum might not have the
name blocked out like ours. It is fairly easy to trace in
certain circumstances, and in others it is more difficult

(Pause)

Mr. Angleton. This originally went to Mr. John Mertz, who
was my Executive Officer.

Mr. Wallach. lle was at one time the project chief, was
he not?

ur. Angleton. Yes, I think so. Yes, he was the project
chief.

Mr. Wallach. You're talking about the January 11th
memorandum went to John Mertz?
~ Do you recall ever discussing it with him on or about

Mr. Angleton. I did not discuss it with hin, He prepared
on l February '62 the answer. The project, actually, the head
of the project at that time was a man called Chalmers.

Mr. Wallach, Me prepared it under the signature of the
Deputy Chief, CI Staff? .

Mr. Angleton. That's right.

Mr. Wallach. Who would that have been at that time?

Mr. Angleton. His name was James R, Hunt.

Mr. Wallach. Do you recall ever discussing this cover

story in the early 'G0s, '62, or the need for a cover story?

Mx. Angleton. I can't recall that. We had a major defector

in December '61, and I think from then on for a year or so that
wily

was about my own preoccupation, but I do not recall this -- 1

mean, I have read it since.

Mr. Wallach, Do you think that in today's time there would

be consideration given to a cover story such as this as was

|| considered in the early ‘60s?

Mr. Angleton. Well, you see, your report says a memorandum!
for CI staff. The actual thing is for Chief, CI Staff, Attentio:

Mr. Mertz.

Mr. Wallach. Yes. I think this says attention CI, also
and his name is blocked out.

Mr. Angleton. I didn't see that.

Mr. Wallach. I am saying it did or did not get to you.
You say it didn't, and that is a matter of record. But the
memorandum which Mr. Mertz sent in reply under Mr. Hunt's
signature really in Paragraph 5 states, "It is most important

that all Federal law enforcement and U.S. intelligence agencies

vigorously deny any association, direct or indirect, with any

such activity as charged." And his stated reason is that since
no good purpose can be served by an official admission of the
violation, and existing Federal statutes preclude the concoction
of any legal excuse for such violation, it must be recognized
that no cover story is available to any government agency.

And then it goes on to say, "In the event of a compromise,
this position should be made known immediately to the Postmaster
General. le is fully knowledgeable of the project."

And I would like to stop there and ask you if you have

Mx. Angleton. Well, do you have a paper that déals.witn
any meetings with Day before this?

Mr. Wallach. Well, I have a paper that Mr. Helms wrote
that I think you have.

Mr. Angleton. That was before this?

Me. Wallach, A 1961 paper, sir, in which it says, “withhelu
no relevant details.”

very truthfully, Mr. elms does not recall whether or not
he told Hr. Day what -- well, in essence he doesn't recall
what was held -- what no relevant detail meant. Ile doesn't
recall what he told him, and there is a later CCI project

note in '74, or '73, I am sorry, which again says Mr. ifelms

really leaves some doubt as to what he meant.

Iam just wondering if you had ‘any: knowledge.

Obviously Mr. Mertz did, but I was wondering if you did,
whether the Postmaster General was fully knowledgeable of the
project.

Mr. Angleton, No, that would be speculation, but I would
have thought that Mx. Helms would have told him everything, for
the simple reason that he knew him quite well outside government.

Mr. Wallach. Mr. Day? ae

Mr. Angleton. Yes. I mean, I met him at Helms’ house.
seemed to be a friend of the family.

Mr. Wallach. Was there a reason why certain Postmasters
General would have been told and certain would not have been
told? I think there were three or four between Mr. Day and
Mr. Blount?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know the reasoning one way or
another, but I think that behind all of it was that ‘the
Postmaster General in those days was also “at the very top in
terms of the party in power.

mr. Wallach, You mean a Cabinet official?

Me. Angleton. Yeah. It was the standard sinecure for
the campaign head of the party.

plus, fortified by the line in Dick's memorandum -- would you

given very full disclosure, but that again is my own |

mind recalling it to me?

Mr. Wallach. “Withheld no relevant details."

Mr. Angleton, That's right.

Mr. Wallach, Just getting into the fact of a cover story
here, in essence it seems that Mr. Mertz's replying to the
memorandum that was sent to him saying, the hell, we can't
have a cover story here, we've just got to deny, you know,
participation in it}

Nr. Angleton. I agree with his conclusions.

Mr. Wallach. All right. I guess I don't see any more point
to go into that. :

Mr. Angleton. It is possible that Hunt might have discussea
it with me, and this is one month after that defection, and that!
was a full time, seven day a week business.

I also note here in passing that the memorandum of
20 becember 'G2 from Sheffield Edwards to Deputy Director,
Support, subject: Inspection of Office of Security by
Inspector General -- it goes on and refers to Recommendation
41A of Inspector General's report and subsequent evaluation, anc
to the subsequent evaluation of HTLINGUAL, "In connection with
the above-mentioned evaluation, this is to advise you that the
project has been thoroughly reviewed by all interested Agency

components. This review has resulted in the conclusion that thu

project is of value to the Agency's overall mission in the

collection of intelligence, and as such, it should be continued."
Mr. Wallach. But that really doesn't go -- still doesn't

go to what I was going to before, that you were informed after

interviewing certain people that there were certain problems.

I realize you may have been preoccupied with certain other

i things.

Mr. Angleton. I mean I am simply stating that there must

have been some meetings that were held which I don't see any

record of between the Office of Security and our project
| people.

Me. Wallach. Well, I take it that after the first couple
of months, that this project really held no value per Se for the!

ogtice of Security, It was primarily of value to the cI Staff.

Mr. Angleton. Quite the contrary, I think that it was

of value to the Office of Security. I think that they built

_ |up their own files and records on the whole thing. They had

a very first rate research and analysis group that had a lot
\ to do with their responsibilities on employment and distribution

of employees. $o there was a great deal turned up in the

project that related to organizations and things of this sort.

Mr. Wallach. Do you recall at any time Mr. Rocca calling
to your attention that a large number of communications to
Senators Church and Kennedy had been picked up and that this
might not be a great idea to disseminate it throughout the
Agency or to the Bureau; and that there may be a need for a
different procedure once the material reached headquarters?

boes that ring a bell at all?

Mr. Angleton. Who were the two?

Mr. Wallach. Senators Kennedy and Church, and also a

Congressman, I can't remember his name now. The last name

Mr. Angleton, Was that something he wrote on a pink

Mr. Wallach. I don't know, sir, very truthfully, sir.

It outlines the same question you raised, what precipitated

this memorandum, it took a month and a half of investigating to

find out that there was a special files category that did exist
and that there were previous memoranda that for one reason or

another the Agency had not given to us, although they were

| requested, and we made a priority request again yesterday

Me. Angleton. Well, the special category doesn't surprise
me because certain letters such as that Hammer business, and
Philby and a few other things, would go into -- I mean, would
be segregated, because there would be a lot of collateral
probably attached to it.

Me, Wallach. I'm not disagreeing with you, but it eae
understanding that all of the special category items included
was mail to or from appointed or elected U.S. officials, or at
least a special category or file, so there may have been other
special files, and I think we've had testimony that insofar
as this project was concerned, except for the occasional hot

item that might be sent directly to someone higher, that this

| was the only special procedure set up, and it was precipitated

ds a result of correspondence.coming in that was described
before.

I think if you remember, that was back at the time of

Vietnam, and we mentioned Congress was acting on that, and I

believe Senator Church was just taking a tour and was receiving
correspondence

file, because I don't.

and the events that happened during that time, and if we could
focus our attention on that.

What is the first time that you recall, Mr. Angleton, that
you recall there was any consideration being given to really
i terminating the project?

ur. Angleton. It came up more than once, and it usually

came up as a result of somebody who was a contact of Security
going to Security and telling them that they had better have
| new principals or they had a change of some sort, they wanted

reassurance.

Mr. Wallach. What do you mean by new principals?

Mr. Angleton. A new Postmaster General, basically
there would be a change of people at the top.

ur. Wallach. Well, you say it happened more than once.

You mean it happened more than once in the life of the’ project?

You're talking about the period -- wa're talking

about --

20003

Mr. Angleton. I'm talking about through the life of the

project, I mean, if there were any changes in the Post Office

i or something, there would be concern expressed that those

people should be briefed.

Let. 8.6, wasminaton, 0.6,

Mr. Wallach. Was there concern, if you know, that the

hail opening going on so the Postmaster didn't stumble upon it
and make an inquiry or just to tell him that there was a mail
opening going on? I think there is a difference, in my mind,
and I don't think we have any hard evidence that any Postmaster
General up to Mr. Blount was ever told, and I can see, reasons
for both types of concerns, but the first one would almost make

t
more sense to me, because the Postal Inspectors in New York knew |

that mail was being provided. Some of the clerks knew the

mail was being provided. In fact, one worked in the operation.

But there is doubt that any of them knew that mail was

actually being opened; such is their testimony. It would almost

seem to make more sense to brief the Postmaster General, yes,

we have this intercept, and it's not in accordance with the

usual procedures, but we are just covering the mail and, you know,

we just wanted to let you know about that.
And I really, when I ask if you know either way of whether

that was the conern, or the conern was to tell them that we

were opening mail.

Mx. Angleton. Well, I mean, I cannot remember specifically
I never attended any meeting with the Postmasters, and the
memorandum, though, well itvcame back, were fairly Generel:
‘There wasn't any detailed eee of the conversation, as
I recall it, but there's no question, though, through the life

of the project, the question of continuing it or not came up

from time to time.

TOP SECRET



Mr. Wallach. Aside from the question of continuing it,
was there any difference of degree in that question after, Mr.

Cotter came on board as the Chief Postal Inspector, say from

Mr. Wallach. On the other hand, because he was in Security

opened,

think you really don't know anytiing about what his concern
was, or you never really discussed that?

Mr. Angleton. I don't think -- my understanding is his

TOP SECRET



Prone (Ares 202) $44-6000

concern was the extent to which he would be compromised, I mean,
his job would be compromised in the Post Office, and he always
wanted some kind of laying on of hands, that is, the Director
seeing the Postmaster General and making sure that there was
some kind of touching of base there. That is my general
impression of Cotter's concern.

Mr. Wallach, Is that essentially -- I'm not trying to

|
{
put words in your mouth -- that he was trying to protect himself}
|
|
|

to make sure that his boss knew?

Mx. Angleton. Yes, I think so. I mean, that is my

impression. I mean, I read the papers about his appearances
j

and so on, and I don't bear him any ill will for his statements.

| I mean, I think all throughout he was torn about this project.

| we was very ill at ease with it, and I think he -- that his

position was very difficult.
Mr. Wallach. I would like to get from you, as best

can, if you remember the sequence until the termination,

we have a couple of documents here. I'm sure that these

documents that you have seen and you do have, but in any

I will show them to you, but I would like to get at your

memory now as to what happened in general terms.

Hr. Angleton. On the termination?
Mr. Wallach. - The events leading to the termination.
Mx. Angleton. Well, what I recall simply is again a

meeting had occurred, I think, while Nelms was still Director,

TOP SECRET



|regarding the question of cotter, and it was decided to stil1

go ahead with the project. I can't remember whether there were

any recommendations about seeing anybody at this moment.
Subsequently, when Dr. Schlesinger camo aboard, Cotter

did raise a very. strong issue with the Office of Security, and

he coupled it with sort of an ultimatum that if certain steps

|jwere not taken, that he would abandon the operation, and I was

not present, and the ultimatum was presented to Dr. Schlesinger, |

i
and I assume it was Osborn who signed, or somebody. So the i
. : |

|

issue was drawn,
There was to have been a meeting on this in which there would

| be arguments presented to Dr. Schlesinger. Then something

happened there, It was the same day, I think, that Colby was

i

| So the meeting did not take place. which had been scheduled,

In my argument, I induced him to go to a meeting that I

had scheduled on another subjéct with the Director and so I
pre-empted some of the time in Colby's presence to put up
another argument to the Director to the effect that in my
opinion the President ‘hada -vedted interest inithis.

Mr. Wallach. You say the President?

Mr. Angleton. Yes. And I say the decision -- I mean, I
questioned that the Director of Central Intelligence could do
away with the project, iwithout: it being a decision of the
Executive.

Mr. Wallach. Was the President aware of the project?

‘Mr. Angleton. Well, can I come back to your question?
I'm just trying to recount what I recall hera.

Mr. Wallach. Go ahead.

Mr. Angleton. Because I felt that. there was really grounds:
for very duep axamination of the value of it, its value to the

Bureau and ourselves, and he, in effect told me and he told

Colby also that he would be very pleased, or words to that

effect, to consult the Prusident, and he overruled his

previous ruling with Colby about closing it down and instructed

i Colby to get word through to Cotter that if he would hold off

on his ultimatum that he would consult with higher authority,
and this word wss passad through Colby to Security who, in turn,
talked to Cotter and he refused to do it and it was closed down

Mr,.’Wallach., Are you saying you just went after one
person?

Mr, Angleton. Well, more or less, Either that or
looking for a category of communication.

Mr, Wallach, What you're saying is although it may

have had this same format, it was much narrower in the items

that they picked up.

Mr. Angleton. And I assumed that it was very temporary
for the life of that particular internal security matter.

Mr. Wallach. You're saying then that you would have no

knowledge of a project that lasted 18 years?

Mr, Angleton, No.

Mr. Wallach. You're saying of a project, the matter
would run in our particular case for x-number of months?

Mr. Angleton, That's right, where they identified the
same agent.

Mr. Wallach, But you don't know of any projects that

thay used just to try to identify agents?

Mr, Angleton. . Well, I know of that type of thing but

IT thought that that was of relatively short duration, Those

were in the questions of legals, I mean where they were trying:

to get patterns of communication.

Mr. Wallach. Have you ever heard of the term z coverage?
Mr. Angleton. What?
Mc. Wallach. 2% coverage.
Mr. Angleton. I've heard of it, but I didn't know it
was specifically mail.
Mr. Wallach. It may have been other things, too.

In other words it was not a realistic possibility to

assume the Bureau would take this over?
You mean they you’ went through the formalities.of

asking?

Mr. Angleton. No, I mean when I called up and asked
this fellow a curbstone opinion as to whether the FBI would
be prepared to take on the Hunter and he just told me to
forget it. Simply they wouldn't be able to man it or to
handle it.

Mr, Wallach, Was there any discussion?

Mr, Angleton. Of course there would be another policy
reason for that. I don't think the Buraau would get into
an operation of this sort where they would be passing to us
the’ raw materials. I mean that is a ai aoresn policy.

In other words, we had a different customer's list th

he would have should they take this project on.

Mr. Wallach, Do ydu recall who was the Deputy Chief
of CI staff on January 27th, 1961 or 1961 who that would have
been?

Mr. Angleton. That would have been Jim Hunt.

Mr. Wallach. In the mamorandum for the Chief of Operatio:

EDP that date Mr. Ilunt says: "On January 5, 1961, Don
Moore, Deputy to Al Bellmont, very condifidentially
advised that they" -- by that "they" he means the Bureau --
“had set up a similar but riore limited coverage to examine
mail to certain cities in Europe. Their examination is solely
to look for suspicious letters that might be mailed by
illegal Soviet agents. This coverage has positively located
Gru illegal channel."

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Angleton, I just wanted to grasp here, I just saw
in one of the memorandums that you referred to --

Mr, Wallach, Is that the 27th January, ‘61 memorandum?

Mr. Angleton. No, this is again going back to the

batch of memos --
Mallach. Exhibit 10.
Mr. Angleton, Colby and Schlesinger.
Mr. Wallach, Yas, sir.
Mr. Anglaton, There is our presentation for the
project.

Mr. Wallach. Is that essentially that paper that you

gave to the Director?
Mr, Angleton. Well, I don't: know exactly what ‘stimulated

it, except that it was a paper, I think, prepared to show the

prone (Aras 202) 544-6000

concern of the meeting that we were going to have to take
place. There was supposed to be a meeting with Mr. Austin,
myself, and probably my deputy and Karamessines and so on.
And that was cancelled.

But in any event, what I was referring to was in going

through the chronology here on page 3, there is a statement

made on page 3, paragraph C:

“Occasional exploratory openings conducted at

ation on a highly selective basis was deemed necessary

in the national security interest."

Now that sequentially in terms of what they're discussing
would have been prior to our taking on the project.

Mr. Wallach. But again, this was a document that was
prepared in early '73 or late '72, but probably would have
Jooked back at other documents to be prepared?

Mr. Angleton. It would have been a synthesis of the
holdings on the project probably prepared by Scotty. Miler in

February, '73.

intelligence. This is a feeling I've always had’. but --

Mr, Wallach, Do you remember Mr. Schlesinger discussing

with ypu the cost of the operation in terms of actual funds?

Mr. Anglaton, No. We only talked to the question of
content and the relation to the Bureau. And this was a very
brief discussion.

Mr. Wallach. Well, who was getting that performance to
Angleton and reading that January. 27, 1961 memorandum, which
talks about Don Moore offering to put CIA names on an FBI
watch list? I was wondering, this sort of cuts against what
you said about the Bureau not conducting any operations like
this.

r

Mr. Angleton. I know that operation you are discussinc.
That again was one where it was designed for a very specific
purpose and one purpose alone, and that was to get the pattern ;
of communications to certain neutral country places before
it went on to Moscow with illegals.

Mr. Wallach. Do you know when those projects that you
are talking about ended? Did they end?

Mx. Angleton. Well, I say none of this do I know
officially.

Mr. Wallach. Well,'I realize it's hearsay and it

. percolated up, but you, for example, said you can read

intelligence reports and through your experience, as other

people have said, tell us something was recaived froma

Mr, Wallach. An opening of a letter?
Mr. Angleton. An opening of a letter. But it could
also hava been a bag job of some sort.

But in any event, the precision of what followed was

something that must have come off of a document.

Mr. Wallach. Well, did you, for example, note that
this ended when Mr. Hoover died, for example, that the FBI
stopped at least instances of mail openings at that time, or
did you notice any stoppage at all?

Mr. Angleton. Nope.

Mr. Wallach. You're saying that insofar as you know,
the same mail -- in other words, it continued in the same
pattern that it had always been.

Mr. Angleton. Well, you see, I am not cognizant of
any long-term mail opening by the Bureau. But let's take a
simple case, If they were surveilling a man and he put a
letter in a mailbox down at the Post Office, they might have
sonehody down behind the counter who “picked up the letter."

Mx, Wallach. What I am asking is, really, these types
of incidents you are describing, did you know this, and I

realize this is only from what you gleaned, sir, that it stoppe(!

They would have put it into --

“Mr. Angleton. A report.

Mr. Wallach. Into a report.

Mr. Angleton, It would be a subject of file with the
information,

Mr. Wallach. Do you know if there was a special
liaison set up between Mr, Ober and the Bureau?

Mr. Angleton, I think so.

Mr. Wallach, Was there one particular person who was
in contact?

Hr, Angleton, I imagine Ober himself.

Mr. Wallach, At the Bureau, I'm sorry.

Mr. Angleton. No, I mean oh, he may have had, in
addition to the regular liaison man that came every day, he
probably had liaison with somebody who was a specialist who
was in the field. He was a specialist and that probably in
one stage meant George Moore.

Mr, Wallach. Was there a discussion of detailing

ir. Angleton. When Colby and myself -- I mean you have
to keep in mind a little odd coincidence.

Colby came down to my office to deliver ms the final

closing down of the project. I hada meeting scheduled for

3:00 to sce the Director on an entirely different matter.
Colby actually came down at that time to sne Mr. Karamessines
and Cord Meyer to the effect’ that he had been appointed
Deputy Director of Plans.

So I told him that I had a meeting at 3:00, that I was
going to contest his memorandum closing down the operation
with tir. Schlesinger, and I asked him if he would come alony

at that time because there was a real time factor

involved, which he did.

TOP SECRET

And so I went up and explained to the Director that

I wanted to. protest the decision, And that is when I put
up the proposal and I went through the question of the FBI
and whatnot, and then’the suggestion was put up by Mr. Colby
that wa could detail all of our personnel over there to the
FBI, which was totally in my view unrealistic because. the
people's careers are in our business. And second, I maan the
FBI would never accept’:such a proposal. It was totally
unrealistic. And that was when I put up the proposition that
prior to the final death of tha project, that in my view it
should be raised at the highest executive level as to whether
it should be terminated or not, since, if it was terminated,
it would not be re-opened again, At least give the President
that option.

So Dr. Schlosinger turned to Mr. Colby and stated that
he would like him -- that he had reconsidered, that he
would like him to go back to Cotter with the statement of
suspending that for a few days in order that he could take
it up "at the highest level." But he had told both of us
that he was prepared to discuss it with the President and
that's the end of it.

Mr, Wallach. I think you've given me a very good
accounting of that. I would just like to have a couple nore

Mr. Angleton. That's right. z

Mr. Wallach, And calling your attention to Paragraph 5,

concerned for any flap would cause CIA the worst possible
publicity and embarrassment, le opined that the operation shoul

be done by the FBI because they could better withstand such

the DS stated that he thought the operation served mainly
an FBI requirement. The CCI countered that the Bureau would
not take over the operation now and could not serve essential
CIA requirements as we have served theirs; that, moreover, CI
staff sees the operation as foreign surveillance.

‘There are a couple of things I would like to discuss

Mr. Wallach. It seems that Mr. Karamessines was also
saying here that this was domestic surveillance, and one of
your responses was that this was foreign surveillance,

Could you kind of elaborate on that? Is there really a
distinction? r
Mr. Angleton. rT am not sure, I think that we're both

saying the same things in a way. The -- i think that the basic

| thrust of Mr. Karamessinés feeling was the question, to what.

j extent it had been compromised and whether there would be a

Flap, and his thought of passing it over to the FBI, in my

sj view, it just simply would not fly at all. In other words,

they would not accept it.

The Agency was much more qualified in terms of the

product and the handling of. it than anybody else, to our way

of thinking, and it was, no question that it served both domesti
and foreiyn interests, about things, Soviets who came here and

Soviets who returned there,

here was a young girl in New York who was a fugitive from

be briefed by Mr. Helms, and he wanted that to protect his

back, so to speak, and Mr. Helms had concurred because for

that Mr. Mitchell wouldn't have said I knew, and he would have

him, that type of thing.

on substantive cases, but also of discussing the whole problem

Mr, Wallach, Exactly, but all I'm saying is that Mr

‘objections,

Mr. Wallach. Mr. Angleton, without quibbling about footnot
it seems that in any event the Bureau was net pushing for. the
implementation of covert mail coverage,

But in any event --

Mr. Angleton. That was after, that was the position of
Mr. Moover's which did not jive with Mr. Sullivan, who was the
Chaixman of the working group.

Mr. Wallach, So, what you're saying is the fact that it's
written here, covert coverage has been discontinued, referred
only to the FBI?

n
Mr. Angleton. No. I'm referring only to the footnote.

Mr. Wallach. I know, but I'd like to -- I understand the

explanation. I believe you're correct, in fact, I know you

are correct, but what I'm asking is that the President here is
asking what cannot we do and what haven't we been able to do
because of the laws as they exist, and here you are saying we

cannot do covert coverage because it is illegal, but yet, on

| the other hand, covert coverage was going on, at least in

San Francisco and at least in New York.
Mr. Angleton. But not known to the other parties in the

Mr. Angleton, Well, it was a question that was asked me.
Mr. Wallach. Asked you by whom?
Angleton. Mr. Johnson.

Mr. Wallach. Well, I'm sorry ~-

Mr. Angleton. Well, I'm going to -- may I look at that a
moment, because there's something that escaped my attention.

Mr, Wallach. Surely.

I think any light you can shed on this would be useful.
It's just, I don't think anybody --

Mr. Angleton. You see, the basic -- the Bureau presided
over all of these proceedings. ‘The other representatives outside
of ourselves were unaware of our mail:coverage, and therefore
it is my understanding -- let me see ~~ that as far as I know,
we did not spell out to anyone present about what we were
doing. So it stood to reason, except when you come down to
page 30, and this is where I've got to get together with Hr.
Ober, it comes down to covert coverage. It states, high
level postal authorities have in the past provided complete
cooperation and maintained full security of this program.

Now, this is -- what I can't understand is whether this
is referring to LINGUAL, because only high postal authorities

knew of its existence, and persons involved are highly trained,

Mr, Wallach, In any event, just upon my reading --

Mr. Angleton. My reading of the recommendation being put

jin the way it was put in, It was simply one of saving or with-

holding from the other participants the actualities. we had
the Army participant, made very clear to us on more than one

occasion that he couldn't even safeguard the documents, that he

; couldn't even trust the typists, etc. Ile didn't even know how

it was going to go through channels, to present it at high
enough levels in the Department of Defense to have it approved.
