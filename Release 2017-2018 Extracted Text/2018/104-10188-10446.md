PROJECT LIONION

This is a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance

operation against the PBHUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

onsulate) in Mexico Clty.. The above-listed objectives are accomplished b

two trained, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street fron

the target.

The project 1s In consonnnce with Pilority A, Objective i, of the

current Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

Background. This project, herewith presented for approval for the first time,

does not represent a new operation.

LIONION activity has been going on since

1962 and costs have heretofore been charged to PBRUMEN FI funds.

operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMAN Embassy,

both

staff and visitors.

These photographs are normaily reviewed for identi-

fications by the PBRUMEN section at the Station, then shown separately to

LITAMIL-9 and LITAMIL-7 who are l

They are

subsequently forwaried to the CI section of WII/SA where they are shown

• to PERUMON intelligence detectors AMNIP-I and AMMUG1.

Of those assets to whom

they are routinely shown, LITAMIL-9 has to date made the largest number of

identifications.

The photos have proven of great value.

arrival of a new imbassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the

Station,

In addition to the identification of staff and visitore, the photos

(accompanied by a log kept by the LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action

(arrivals and depertures) and details of personal associations (who associates

with

whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations asainst

the target.

In addition to photography, LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 are often called upon

to do visual surveillance of the target installation and LIONION-1 is essential

to the dispatching of the LI-BRACE surveillance team against individuals

associated with the target.

Because of the presence of police patrol cars in

the vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to the

target, hence the need for LIONION-l's dispatching services.

The presence of LIONION-] and LIONION-2 also Insures continued occupancy of

a valued piece of real estate which will be used as a listening post when the

Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in the

target in the

of concealed radio transmitters.

LIONION-1 16 a YOUng PRINEN lawyer i extle. • He left PARUMaN in 1960,

his carly years.

a taste of clandestine activity,, decided i remain in Mexico. LIONION-2, his

mother, was recruited in 1961, as LILIY-I. as a basehouse occupant and

operator in the LIFEAT/LIbIODS technical meration aimed at the PERUMEN

Embassy. At this sane time LIQUOtI aiso faased Into LIFEAT/LIERODE work and

the two worked together as a tess.

In 19*2 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked

together in processing the take of the LIai LILODE/MIRAP Installation, now

Known as LIOMEN. At this tise their cryzaims vera changed from LILILY-l and

respectively.

In ie latter part of 1962 the two agents

began the present photographic surveillans operation.
