PROJECE LIONICN

A. Identification. This is a technical (primarily photographic) surveillance
‘operation against the PBHUMEN Embassy in Mexico City,

B. Objectives: The operation is designed to (1) furnish photographic coverage
during daylight hours of the entrances of the tarset installation, (2)
dispatch physical surveillance teams against persons associated with the
target, and (3) keep in readiness a listening post for the monitoring and
recording of eventual technical penetration operations of the target.

see The target installation is the PBRUMEN Bubassy compound (including
.'. Consulate) in Mexico City.” The above-listed objectives are accomplished by
: ~ “two trained, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street from
- the target.

The project is in consonance with Prlority A, Objective 1, of the
current Related Migsion Directive for Mexico.

C. Background. This project, herewith presented for approval for the first tine,
does not-represent a new operation. LIONION activity has been yoing on since
1962 and costs have heretofore been charged to PEAUMEN FI funds. The

~ operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMEN Eabassy,
voth staff and visitors. These photographs are normally reviewed for Identi-
fications by the PERUMEN section_at the Station, then show separately to
LITAMIL-9 and LITAMIL-7 who are
They are subsequently forwanted tO thé CT section of WH/SA where they are shown

- to PBRUMEN intelligence derectors AMNIP-1 and AMMUG-1. Of those assets to vhon
they are routinely shown, LITAMIL-9 has to date made the largest number of
identifications. The photos have proven of great value. Within hours of the
arrival of a new ‘inbassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the
Station, In addition to the identification of staff and Visitors, the photos
(accompanied by & log kept by the LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action
(arrivals and departures) and detalls of personal associations (who associates
with whon) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against

the target.

In addition to photography, LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 are often called upon
to do visual surveillance of the target installation and LIONION-1 is essent
to the dispatching of the LI=MBRACE surveillance team against individuals
associated with the target. Because of the presence of police patrol cars in
the vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to the
target, hence the need for LIONION-1's dispatching services, ‘

The presence of LIONION=1 and LIONZON-2 also insures continued occupancy of
@ valued piece of real estete which will be used as a listening post when the
Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in the
target in the fora of concealed radio transmitters.

Operational Auseta’ (Personnel).

LIONTON-1 16 a young PBRUMEN lawyer i= exile. -He left PBRUMEN in 1960,
planning to continue on via Mexico to the Tkited States where he residat in
his ecrly years. Hie two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer
in the Department’ of Commerce in Washingtcc. the other a police official in
Tampa, Florida.” While in Mexico LIONION-1 vas recruited, aa LILILY-1, to
perfora PBRUMEN. operational support servizss.for the Station and, once having
a taste of clandectine activity, decides t>-remain in Mexico. LIONION-2, hie
nother, was recfuiled in 1961, as LILILY->, as a basehouse occupant and
operator in.the LIFEAT/LIWRODS technical sceration aimed at the PERUMSN
Babassy. At thie same time LIONION-l also chased into LIFEAT/LIERODS vork and
the two worked together as @ tean, In 1952 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked
together in processing the take of the L /LILRODE/MATRAP Installation, now
known as LIOMEN, At this tine their eryziccyas vers changed from LILILY-1 and
2 to LIFEUD-22 and 23, respectively. In wiz latter part of 1962 the two agents
began the present photographic surveillance operation.

LIONION-1 is the mainstay ef the operssion. LIONION-2 acts as bis assistent
and fill-in at such times as ke is abs: ‘rum tie observation post. Bota serve
principally as observers and photosraphers. LIONIO!-1 also acts as a dispatcher
for the LIFMBRACE surveillance teaa from ich he is coapartmented. Dispatching
is done by radio using pre-nrran innocucs code terminolony; the teem does not
know LIOKIOt-i or nis precise locatic NICN-1 also processes on the preatses
all photographic coverage of the asin Sn wate through final printing, cropping
end mounting. Photographic coverage of the Vonsulate gate is processed through the

negative development stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of
the agents, that eg PBRIME! reticess ther ene wuilnerable to pressure which aight
be brought upon them by KUBARK through’ the Mexican government should they get out
of Mne, Motivation is a coabinaticn of > tal necessity and violent aversion
to, and determination to bring about the izwwfall of, the AMPHUG regime. An * *
additional motivating factor is that bot: gents actually enjoy what for sany would
be monotonous work. Psycholosically, ther are ideally suited to this sort of work.

Both agents realize that they ere voriirs for PBPRIM! intelligence; LTONION-1
appears to be avare that he {s working for TUGARK, The cover utilized by LIONION-2
is that of dependent mother. LICNION-l nesses as a would-be writer who can afford
to dabble without notable publishing success tecause of family landholdings in
Tampa, Florida (inherited fron his dece father), which enable hin to Live as
a "rentista,” one who lives on incoce rees other than gainful exployment.
His rentista status is registered with the Xexican government. In Octcver 1964
this cover successfully withstoal intensive investigation by Mexican authorities
checking on persons of questionable staves tax collection purposes. The
Station plans to bolster the writing cover vith supporting documents fron a
Aiterary agent in New York City; these will se requested in separate correspondence.



Communication is priarily with LIONION-1; with LIONION-2 only in hi
absence. Meetings, pre-arranged or. signalled by innocuous phone calls (calls
fron LIONION-1.g0 through a telephone cut-out), are usually held at the
LIONION-1 safe apartment. This apartaent, which vould appear to be a LIONION-2

“Hugh T, FRANCOTTS, meets with LIOKION<1 at least once a week. The Case Officer,

Scourkty Evatuntion, If otther. of the LIONION agénte are uncovered by Mexican
authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have’ been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile orvanization based in the JMMAVE
area on a voluntary, non-pald, patrkotic basis and to stick to the story covering
their incone, ‘This would probably ‘Hold up unless tiiey were caught in flagrante

refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an oxile organization.
In any event, LIONION-1 has a cloce relationship with an official of the Mexican
president's office. This connection, developed by LICHION-1 for his own protection,
enabled him to weathey the tax investigation and can be used by him to overcome any
future difficulties with Mexican authorities.

Under Mexican lav, the principal (photographic) activity of the project 16
not illegal, therefore uncovering of the photographic operation would not of
itself result in arrest or prosecution, It is usually possible to stave off
investigation or house search for ‘a pertod of tine sufficient to remove compromis-
ing mitertal from the premises. The LIONION base house was once cleaned completely
in one evening and could again be cleaned, probably in less time, if circumstances

should warrant.
The target installation is aware that photo curvelllence is a probability.

On one occasion AMKNOB-1, a JMWAVE asset, was shown a noarby building (not the
LIONICN vase) by & PBRUMEN Biabassy officer and told that it was a KUBARK photo

avoid operational compromise, he cannot renew his expired paceport at the
PBRUMEN Consulate. For this reason the Station will request KURIO? tn separnte

Security measures employed in this operation are designed to make it virtually
impossible for any opposition service to link LICNION personnel with the Station,
