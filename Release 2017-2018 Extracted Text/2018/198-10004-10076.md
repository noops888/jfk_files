MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

(Prepared for the Meeting of Friday, January 25, 1963, 4 p.m.)

FROM: Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

SUBJECT: = United States Policy Toward Cuba

United States Policy

On November 20, the President set forth the broad guide-
lines of United States policy with respect to Cuba in the
following words:

"As for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are
removed from Cuba and kent out of the hemisphere in
the future, under adequate verification and safeguards,
and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive
communist purposes, there will be peace in the
Caribbean. And, as I said in September, 'we shall
neither initiate nor permit aggression in this
hemisphere. '

“We will not, of course, abandon the political,
economic and other efforts of this hemisphere to halt
subversion from Cuba, nor our purpose and hove that
the Cuban people shall some day be truly free. But
these policies are very different from any intent to
launch a military invasion of the island.”

Objectives

Accordingly, the objectives of United States
policy with respect to Cuba are:

1.

Protecting the security of the United States
and the other states of the Organization of
American States (OAS) by assuring that
offensive weapons are not reintroduced into
Cuba;

Removal of remaining Soviet forces from Cuba;

Preventing Cuba from taking any aggressive
military action against other Caribbean states;

Maximizing the cost to the Soviet Union of

Maximizing the political isolation of the

and especially from states of the OAS.
Whenever possible, U. S. actions against Cuba
should be multilateral, preferably based upon
the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)
or on resolutions adopted by the Crganization
of American States. The newly-won hemispheric
solidarity on the Cuban issue should not be
jeopardized by seeking OAS actions of marginal
value and which might split the hemisphere;

objectives will be forthcoming.

1. In addition to current covert Program, such
as intelligence collection, recruitment of
Cuban officials as agents, radio broadcasts,
support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council(CRC)
and other exile group activities and infil-
tration of propaganda materials:

a. Intensify covert collection
of intelligence within Cuba, especially
within the regime;

b. Support the efforts of certain Cuban
exiles, who are associated with
the original aims of the 26 of July
Movement and who believe that the
Castro regime can be overthrown: from
within in order. that they may:
1) cause a split inthe leadership
of the regime at the national or
provincial levels; and 2) create a
political base of popular opposition
to the regime; and, 3) secure
intelligence;

ce. Assist Cuban exiles in developing a
capability to launch balloons carrying
leaflets and other propaganda materials
from international waters into Cuba.
Launch propaganda balloons. after an
operational capability has been

2. With respect to the actions listed below,
the results of Mr. Donovan's imminent
negotiations with Fidel Castro for freeing
the 20-odd American prisoners should first
be ascertained. If these actions were taken
before the conclusion of the negotiations
they could jeopardize the release of the
Americans.

3. If these negotiations fail, or when the
prisoners are recovered, proceed on the
following timetable:

4. Inform NATO and OAS twelve hours in advance
of the proclamation of the four point
shipping orders. (The proclamation calls for
the orders to go into effect in five days).
These orders:

a. Close United States ports to all
vessels of a country whose vessels
engage in carrying arms to Cuba;

b. Close United States ports to any ship
which has carried goods in the Bloc-
Cuba trade within 120 days of the time
it seeks to enter a United States port;

c. Prohibit all United States flag ships
and all ships owned by United States
nationals or residents from entering
any ports of Cuba and from carrying
any goods bound to or from Cuba; and

a later date dependent on the Donovan

another representative of the President

Soviet troops, recommending continued
surveillance and continued vigilance
against subversive activities, and
terminating the invocation of the Rio

B. Contigency Planning

New opportunities for accomplishing our
objectives may arise either as a resvit of Bloc
action in other parts of the world; as a result
of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile actions)
by the Castro-Communist regime itself; or as a
result of uprisings or internal conflict within
Cuba.

Our contingency planning, which will be
undertaken immediately, should include preparations
for increased multilateral and/or bilateral
political and economic measures, large scale use of
Cubans who are now inside Cuba; more extensive
air activity including both high and low level
flights primarily directed toward surveillance
and collection of intelligence, and which may also
have the effect of embarrassing the Castro
government and keeping the Castro forces on ,
continual alert; retaliatory measures, as
appropriate, including the imposition of a
POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in
other countries; severance’ of communic ations
to Cuba; major acts of sabotage on shipping
destined for Cuba and on key installations to
Cuba; intensive naval patrols; anc, ultimately,
the use of U. S. military force. To the extent
feasible, U. S. military forces employed against
Cuba should be accompanied by U. S. militarily-
trained free Cubans and by the armed forces of
those Latin American nations desirous of
participating in the U. S. effort.

Our programs should be designed to encourage
the Brigade members to melt back into the exile
community and engage in constructive pursuits
pending the liberation of Cuba. We should offer
them some special assistance but not to the extent
that they become a perpetual privileged class
within the community, Presidential action on their
behalf would single them out unnecessarily.

,action to include Cuba on the COCOM list, and approaches

to Free World industrial nations to eliminate sale and
shipment of critical items from their Cuban trade.

Existing programs will be reviewed and further
recommendations made as necessary. Planning for the
variety of contingencies related to Cuba will be undertaken
at once.

In addition to current covert programs such as
intelligence collection, recruitment of Cuban officials,
support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) and
other exile activities, infiltration of propaganda
materials, and radio broadcasts, the following are
recommended for approval and immediate initiation:

a. intensified covert collection of intelligence
within Cuba, especially within the regime;

b. support of Cuban exiles who are seeking to
return the 26 of July Movement to its
original aims.

NOTE: It should be noted that approval of the
foregoing actions may impair our ability
to accomplish objective b. (Removal of
remaining Soviet forces from Cuba) because
taking these actions could provide the
U.S.S.R. with rationale for maintaining
its. forces in Cuba. Nevertheless, approval
of the foregoing actions is recommended.

3. Cuban Brigade
: Brigade leaders should be induced to accept a

specially tailored civilian and military program for
Brigade members.

The Brigade should be disbanded as a military unit

for Cubans and join a Brigade reserve unit thereafter.
Our moral obligation would be discharged tc the Brigade
members and creation of a privileged class in the exile
community would be avoided.

ALTERNATIVE II

United States Policy ’

1. Our ultimate objective with respect to Cuba is
the overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime and ‘its
replacement by one compatible with the objectives of the
U.S. and, where possible, sharing the aims of the Free
World. To achieve this objective, the U.S. Government
will apply increasing degrees of political, economic,
psychological and military pressures, as appropriate
opportunities present themselves or can be created,
until the Castro/Communist regime is overthrown.

_ 2. Our immediate objectives are to isolate the
Castro/Communist regime from the Free World and from
the Bloc; weaken it economically; promote internal
dissension, erode its domestic political support;
frustrate its subversive activities; negate its influence
in the hemisphere; increase the cost to the Bloc of
sustaining the regime; and obtain the withdrawal of Russian
troops from Guba.

3. Isolating, undermining and discrediting .the
Castro/Communist regime through the exercise of all
feasible diplomatic, economic, psychological and
covert actions may achieve the immediate objectives
and could create propitious conditions in Cuba for
further advance toward our ultimate objective.

4. We should be in a position to respondwith open
military support (to include such items as materiel,
advisors, training, and Special Forces support and,
if necessary, up to the full range of military forces),
to a request for assistance from any anti-Castro/Commnist
group or groups in Cuba which demonstrate an abllity to
survive, which threaten the present regime, and whose
aims are compatible with those of the U.S.

5. Invasion of Cuba by U.S. military forces, as
distinguished from military support upon request of
indigenous forces, should not be undertaken in the
absence of aggression or other Castro/Communist and/or

Soviet

pig ae

Soviet actions that threaten the peace or security of the
hemisphere. This does not preclude appropriate U.S.
retaliation for isolated hostile acts by the Castro/ |
Communist or Soviet forces.

6. To the extent feasible, U.S, military forces
employed against Cuba should be accompanied by U.S.
militarily-trained free Cubans and by the armed forces
of those Latin American nations desirous of participating
in the U.S. effort.

7. Intensive, comprehensive and continuing intellig
gathering in depth on Cuba should be identified as a’ prima:
objective of the national intelligence effort.

Boa
ee

8. Whenever possible, U.S. actions against Cuba
should be multilateral, preferably based upon theTTreaty
of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact) or on resolutions
adopted by the Organization of American States. The

- newly-won hemispheric solidarity on the Cuban issue

should not be jeopardized by seeking OAS actions of
marginal value and which might split the hemisphere.

Overt and covert annexes of specific actions in a
support of this policy will be prepared.

Discussion

The active pursuit of our ultimate objective in-
volves a phased and controlled series of political,
economic, psychological and military actions. Such
actions might incligde leaflet dropping; propaganda urging
sabotage, strikes, and opposition to the regime; psycho-
logical operations urging defections; large scale training
of Cubans in the U.S. and the use of such Cubans inside
Cuba; extensive air activity including both high and low
level flights primarily directed toward suyveillance and
collection of intelligence, and which may also have the

effect

@OP SECRET

HW 50955 Docld:32276061 Page 53



=e.

effeet of embarrassing the Castro government and keeping the
Castro forces on continual alert; retaliatory measures, as
appropriate, including the imposition of a POL blockade;
harrassment of Cuban officials in other countries;

severance of communications to Cuba; major acts of

sabotage on shipping destined for Cuba and on key
installations in Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and,
ultimately, the use of U. S. military forces.

In addition, this course of action would involve a
broad gamut of carefully timed political, economic, psy-
chological and covert actions, such as OAS sanctions,
Caribbean security arrangements, intensified surveillance
of and publicity concerning Castro/Communist subversive
activities in Latin America, application of Four Point
shipping restrictions and other economic sanctions, and
a series of actions designed to obtain, to the greatest
extent possible, multilateral approval of an participation
in the campaign to unseat the Castro/Communist regime.

This course of action has the advantage of attaining
the objective more rapidly and under more controlled
conditions than the alternative stated by the Coordinator.
Indeed, this may be the only course of action that will
accomplish the ultimate objective. It involves greater
risks; and, in the short run, a greater expenditure of
money and material and far greater numbers of personnel.

7 From the standpoint of international politics, the
U. S. will probably be subjected to criticism for
jaggression from the uncommitted nations. It is difficult
‘te predict the reaction of the Latin American governments.
They may attack the U. S. for “intervening” or they may react
favorably (as they did during the missile crisis). To a
Aavge extent, the reaction of the nations throughout the
“world, and particularly the Latin American nations, will
depend upon how adroitly theee actions are handled. For
example, there may even be advantages to the fact that our
active policy and the courses of action under it may

eventually become impossible to conceal. If properly
handled, the overt aspects of this policy may serve not
only to mitigate any unfavorable reactions from other
countries, but alse to gain, particularly in Latin
Aserica, increasing appreciation of the threat of Castro/
Communist Cuba.

The active pursuit of our objective will make it clear
that the U. S. will not permit the maintenance of a
communist base in the hemisphere. From the standpoint of
military posture, the more active approach may be
subjected to counteractions from the Sino-Soviet Bloc
elsewhere. As we increase the pressures on Castro/Comunist
Cuba and the extent of our commitment to overthrow the regime,
U. S&S. prestige becomegmore deeply involved. The further
we progress along this route, the more significant will be.
the loss of U. S. prestige if we alter or abandon it.

The successful execution of this policy will require
careful timing and coordination of our actions and the
development of detailed plans. While such plans would be
designed to bring about the overthrow of the Castro regime
within a given time frame for planning purposes, they
would have to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate
changes to the international situation.

In any case, at crucial points along the way, it will
be necessary for the highest levels of our Government to
review the actions already taken and those contemplated and
to assess the advantages of continued and escalated
activity against the disadvantages and dangers of such
activity.

Commitment to this course of action does not exclude

the possibility of actively pursuing the isolation of the
Castro regime from the Bloc.

FROM : Coordinator of Cuban “Affairs: Coueani

SUBJECT: United States Policy Toward Cuba

United States Policy

On November 20, the President set forth the broad guidelines

of United States policy with respect to Cuba in the following
words:
"As for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are
removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in
the future, under adequate verification and safeguards,
and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive
communist purposes, there will be peace, in the Caribbean.
And, as I said in September, 'we shall: neither initiate
nor permit aggression in this.hemisphere.'
"We will not, of course, abandon the political, economic
and other efforts of this hemisphere to halt subversion

from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that the Cuban people

shall some day be truly free. But these policies are very

different from any intent to launch a military invasion of

the island.@

Objectives

Accordingly, the objectives of U.S. policy with respect to

Cuba are:

commynist purposes, there will be peace in the Caribbean,
And, as I said in September, ‘we shall neither initiate
nor permit aggression in this hewisphere.°
: “We will not, of course, abandon the political, economic
_and other efforte of thie hemisphere to halt subversion
from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that the Cuban people
shall some day be truly free. But these policies are very
different from any intent to launch a military invasion of

to Free World industrial nations to eliminate sale and
shipment of critical items from their Cuban trade.

Existing programs will be reviewed and further
recommendations made as necessary. Planning for the
variety of contingencies related to Cuba will be undertaken
at once.

In addition to current covert programs such as
intelligence collection, recruitment of Cuban officials,
support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) and
other exile activities, infiltration of propaganda
materials, and radio broadcasts, the following are
recommended for approval and immediate initiation:

a, intensified covert collection of intelligence
within Cuba, especially within the regime;

b. support of Cuban exiles who are seeking to
return the 26 of July Movement to its
original aims.

NOTE: It should be noted that approval of the
foregoing actions may impair our ability
to accomplish objective b. (Removal of
remaining Soviet forces from Cuba) because
taking these actions could provide the
U,S.S.R. with rationale for maintaining
its forces in Cuba. Nevertheless, approval
of the foregoing actions is recommended.

Brigade members. .

COURSES

SECRET

. ZI -2~

COURSES OF ACTION

. (1) Continue the COAS/OC in being ‘under the Rio Treaty but

take no further action at present.

Considerations:

The Rio Treaty was invoked and the COAS/OC brought into being
for the specific purpose of considering the October missile crisis. i
If the purpose is considered fulfilled, the COAS/OC should either i
7 be terminated or its authorization enlarged to deal with changed :
circumstances. ;

(2) Under the Rio Treaty seek a‘resolution in COAS/OC_which i
condemns Cuba for its actions which continue to endanger the peace, i H
deplores refusal to allow inspection, condemns the presence of 4
Soviet troops and recommends continued surveillance and continued i
vigilance against subversive activities. Peet

Considerations: . fs i

This would promote U.S. objectives vis-a-vis Cuba and would
represent one feasible, approprite, immediate step following the
conclusion of the U.S.-Soviet New York talks.

Although the language would have to be negotiated, it is
believed that unanimity or near-unanimity could be obtained.

Recent statements by Cuban leaders calling for armed insur-
rection in Latin America would be exploited in this connection.

It could be criticized for not constituting sufficiently
vigorous action on the problem of Soviet troops, but it would put H
the OAS on record against their continued presence in the hemis-
phere and dramatize Castro's continued military subservience to i
the Soviet Union. Hy

(3) Terminate the coas/oc on the missile crisis. This

would still leave COAS with its responsibilities under Resolutions
TI and VIII of Punta del Este. (Which provided for a Special Consul-
tative Committee on Security and a Special Committee to study the
further suspension of trade.)

Considerations:

This step could be considered logical, since the COAS/OC was
called into being to deal only with the October missile crisis.

Taken

SECRET
-3+

Taken by itself, this course of action might Raise doubts
concerning the inter-American legal basis under which we are
continuing our surveillance.

Psychologically, if this were the only action taken, it would
appear as though the OAS considered the crisis over, the presence
of Soviet troops unimportant, and its principle of verification
surrendered (on-site inspection and re-introduction of offensive
weapons)

(4) Combine (2) and (3).

Considerations:

This combination of actions is feasiblesand is likely to
obtain unanimity or near-unanimity.

The termination of the COAS/OC makes strong language in the
resolution more acceptable to the "soft" minority.

Termination of the OOAS/0C, even accompanied by the proposed
resolution, is open to some of the criticism indicated under (3).
Much of this could be mitigated if, however, the action is accom-
panied by the action suggested in (9), which imposes economic
sanctions.

(5) Seek to enlarge the basis on which the Rio Treaty was
invoked to encompass the presence of Soviet troops and seek a
resolution in CoASOC calling for their withdrawal.

Considerations:

With adequate consultation and preparation, we should be able
to obtain a substantial majority.

Such action would give a better basis for urging such addi-
tional steps as (6) and (7) and (8).

It would seem undesirable to take this course by itself unless
we seriously contemplate taking some additional strong enforcement
action.

(6) In addition to seek authorization under the Rio
Treaty for collective action, including the use of armed force,

to bring about the withdrawal of soviet troops in Cuba if the
QAS call is not heeded. 7

Considerations:

SECRET

NW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 106


Considerations:

This. action should be seriously considered only if we are
determined to use all possible means to obtain removal of ‘Soviet

troops.

While it should be possible with adequate consultation and
preparation to obtain a substantial majority for further political
and ecoriomic sanctions to hlp bring about the withdrawal of Soviet
troops, it would be difficult to obtain the necessary 2/3 majority
for authorization of the. use of armed force.

(7) Seek_a resolution in. the CoAS/Ogto_sever_all diplomatic
and consular relations with Guba (probably possible o
junction with (5) or (11). :

Considerations:

This would be consistent with general U.S. policy to increase
the isolation of Cuba, but contrary to some present policies
encouraging the maintenance of certain diplomatic missions in Cuba.

Although we could probably obtain the necessary 2/3 vote for
such action (particularly if couched as a recommendation) it would
ve stoutly resisted by Mexico and Brazil and opposed by Chile,
Bolivia and Uruguay, whose contrary arguments would have some appeal.

Probably no more than maximum of 15 votes could be obtained
for this. ‘

(8) Seek_a resolution in the coas/oc_to sever all economic

and commercial relations and all communications with Cuba

(probably possible only in conjunction with. G)-or_( Ti). :

Considerations:

The severance of all economic and commercial relations would
go beyond our current embargo on trade with Cuba which provides
for the exception on humanitarian grounds of the export from.the
U.S. to Cuba of certain foods, medicines, and medical supplies.
Such action would expose us to charges of inhumanity and would
probably nullify our public statements that we have no quarrel
with the Cuban people.

A number of telecommmnications between Latin-America and
Burope are routed through Cuba. Prohibition of these services
would interrupt commnications vital to many of our Latin American
friends. Further, U.S. communications with Cuba should be main-
tained to facilitate the transmission of messages in the national
interest and those for humanitarian reasons.

These

These considerations would make it extremely difficult to
obtain a 2/3 majority in the coas/oc.

(9) Seek resolution in COAS under Resolution VIII of Punta
del_ Este which would recommend:

(a) extension of arms embargo to all items of trade except
food and medicine (Fall back position: extension of
arms embargo to all strategic items);

(b) prohibition of AR ships from transporting embargoed
items and deny use of ports to ships in Bloc-Cuba trade;

(e) denial of over-flights and transit rights to Soviet air-
craft on bloc-Cuba runs. (Points (b) and (c) could also
be added to No. (8).)

Considerations:

This is feasible and consistent with our objectives, and could
be taken independently of other steps.

With adequate consultation and preparation, near-unanimity
should be possible. Brazil would probably not go along. The actual
effect of extending the embargo so far as Latin America is concerned
is more psychological than practical because Latin American countries
ship little except food to Cuba. But it would show forward movement.
and would provide a useful argument with our allies if it included an
appeal to other Free World nations to take similar steps.

It would offer a helpful (though not necessary) basis for U.S.
unilateral steps in controlling shipping, implementing 107 of the
Foreign Assistance Act, and for urging other states to control Soviet
flights to Cuba.

(10) Intensify through COAS and SCCS programs of recommended
controls over subversive activities. Seek. COAS resolution warning
Castro that continued subversive activity may result in action

Considerations:

The course described in the first sentence of. (10) is being
presently pursued under the decision taken at Punta del Este and
should be continued... However, it would be difficult to get unani-
mous or near -unanimous support for the warning resolution because
of the reference to the Rio Treaty.

(11) Invoke Rio Treaty on basis of Castro's continued

subversive activities. 7
Considerations:

If we desire to institute more vigorous collective sanctions vs.
the Castro regime for its subversive activities, it would be neces-
sary to invoke‘:the Rio Treaty since the present functions given the
COAS and Special Consultative Committee on Security (SCCS) under
Resolution II of Punta del Este provide authority only for surveil-
lance and recommendations to governments for control ‘measures.

The primary threat of Castro is his subversive activities in
the hemisphere. Should the level of Castro-directed subversive
activities in the Hemisphere increase appreciably, this would become
amore feasible and desirable course. This becomes an increasing
possibility in view of Castro's recent speech inciting insurrection
in Latin America.

The basis of any such action should consist of the production
of hard evidence of the direct involvement of the Cuban regime in
subversive activities in the hemisphere. There is, however, in-
sufficient hard evidence available at this time to obtain COAS
sie (A U.S. project to collate all available evidence is under
way.

(12) Assign the functions and operations of the Advisory
Defense Committee (abc) to the Inter-American Defense Board (IADB).
This could be done:

(a) by amending the OAS Charter to assign ADC functions to
the IADB;

(b) by the COAS seeking the advice of the IADB; or

(ec) having the OAS member governments designate their
representatives on the IADB to serve also on the ADC.

Considerations:

As to (a), the proposed amendment would have to be referred
to the Quito Conference (whose date has not been set). Moreover,
amendment of the Charter is a difficult and tortuous process and
requires ratification by 2/3 of the member governnents.

As to (b), this-is a feasible course of action which the
Coas/OC could take without specific authority. It might be diffi-
cult, however, depending on the circumstances, to persuade: the
Council of the desirability of such action.

As to (c), member governments could take this course on an
individual basis, but it would be necessary to convince them that
“exceptional circumstances” prevailed which would justify this A
. action under the OAS Charter. a i

COORDINATOR'S RECOMMENDATION

In selecting the optimum combination of actions to take with
respect to the OAS, the political feasibility and international
complications were key factors which I have carefully considered.

Courses of action (2) (3) (4) (9) (10) and (12) would advance
us toward our objective, would. be politically feasible, and would
involve minimum adverse international effects. We could probably
obtain a near-unanimous vote in the OAS for these courses except
(10) and (12). .

Courses (2) (5) (6) (9) (10) (11) and (12) would advance us
considerably further toward our objective, but (6) and (11)
particularly could create a split in hemispheric unity, and would
involve adverse international effects, including alprobable acute
confrontation with the USSR.

I believe courses (1) (7) and (8) will not serve our best
interests at this time. i

I recommend that we take immediately courses (4) and (9).

Course (4) calls for (a) a COAS/OC resolution under the Rio
Treaty which condemns Cuba for its actions which continue to
endanger the peace, deplores refusal to allow inspection, condems
the presence of Soviet troops and recommends continued surveil-
lance and continued vigilance against subversive activities, and
(b) terminate the COAS/OC on the missile crisis. This would still
leave COAS with its responsibilities under Resolutions II and VIII
of Punta del Este which provided for a Special Consultative
Committee on Security and for the COAS to study the further sus-
pension of trade.

w&
Course: (9) calls for a resolution in COAS under Resolution
VIII of Punta del Este which would recommend:

(a) extension of ‘arms embargo to all items of trade except
food and medicine (Fallback position: extension of
arms embargo to all strategic items);

(b)

(b) prohibition of AR ships from transporting embargoed items
and deny use of ports to ships in Bloc-Cuba trade;

(c) denial of overflights and transit rights to Soviet air-
craft on Bloc-Cuba runs.

(d) a call upon other Free World nations to take similar
actions.

The. steps I recommend would start movement forward towards our
objective, carrying the OAS with us, without committing us to any
further action.

After these initial measures are in effect, we should assess
the situation and determine the feasibility of moving forward with
any of the remaining courses of action, or any new courses which
may be opened to us by events.

I believe we should. develop our pressures steadily and gradu-
ally, bringing the OAS along with us, and keeping the situation
under constant review for the optimum opportunity to initiate
additional measures.

I do not believe we should take’a track now which will break
hemi spheric unity. We may need unity later in an emergency.

Neither do I believe we should push the OAS into probable
acute confrontation with the USSR at this time.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

(Prepared for the Meeting of Thursday, January 24, 1963, at 10 a.m)

FROM : Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

SUBJECT: Cuban Brigade

PROBLEM

To determine the future of the Cuban
Brigade (participants in the Bay of
Pigs invasion recently released from
Cuban prisons), and other Cubans who
participated in or trained for the
invasion. To determine the future of
existing Cuban training programs.

DISCUSSION

Approximately 1500 Cubans participated in the Bay
of Pigs invasion (known as Brigade 2506), the great
majority of whom were captured. In December 1962 over
1100 were released.

A decision on the future of the Cuban Brigade and

other Cubans trained militarily by the U. S. must logically
proceed from whatever over all policy the U. S. adopts
toward Cuba...

A trained Cuban Brigade would be of relatively
marginal military value because of its quantitative
limitations and restricted military capability, but its

SECRET_

HW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 112


SECRET
-2-
politico-psychological value as a symbol of Cuban
resistance to Castro/Communism may more than compensate
for its limited military utility.
Any moral responsibility to the. Brigade must be
weighed.
COURSES OF ACTION
Three courses of action appear

feasible with respect to the
Brigade's future.

(1) Induce the Brigade to disband as a military

unit, with no further U. 5. special assistance. 7

If this policy were adopted, Brigade members and
their families would be eligible for the benefits now
accorded to all needy Cuban refugees in the Miami area
(approximately 105,000). These benefits are equivalent
to those received by American citizens in Dade County,
Florida who are in need. The principal ones include:
financial grants of up to $100 per month for a family
and up to $60 a month for an individual; hospitalization
and out-patient facilities at county and private hospitals
for acute illnesses; distribution of surplus food commodities;
employment counseling; resettlement, including transportation
and a transition grant; foster care for unaccompanied
children; special English and refresher courses for doctors
and lawyers at University of Miami; a student loan program
for Cubans attending U. S. universities provides «
up to $1,000 a year; supplemental assistance to Dade
County, Florida, is provided by HEW to cover 50 percent of
cost of educating Cuban refugee children in primary
and secondary schools; payment for a substantial part
of special language courses and vocational training; and
physical examinations and inoculations at time of
entry into the U. S.

SECRET

iW 50955 DocId:32276061 Page 113


BOD has a program providing for enlistment in the
: U. S. Army of those Cuban nationals between the ages of 18
and 30 who pass entrance requirements. (A similar program
for the Navy covers ages 18-26). The program provides
20-22 weeks of training at the conclusion of which they
are transferred as individuals to U. 5. Reserve status.
They are not required to know English. A’two week period
for resettlement is also provided at the termination of
the training.

Another DOD program enables former officers of the
Cuban Army, Navy and Air Force to volunteer on a highly
selective basis for programs in the U. S. Armed Forces.
Training periods are from 20 to 36 weeks. English is
necessary., The officers are in civilian status. They
receive a salary from the Cuban Revolutionary Council and
a per diem through DOD from AID funds which are ‘no longer
available.

Considerations:

This course of action would provide the simplest and
most economical way of disposing of the problem, provide
equal treatment for all eligible Cuban refugees; equivalent
to benefits offered to American citizens.

Individual Cubans could continue to be accepted for
service in the U. S. Armed Forces and their language, skill
and country knowledge could be distributed through various
U. S. units which might be used in an invasion.

The unsatisfactory aspects of this course are that
it would appear to run counter to expectations of the Brigade
as a result of Administration statements and actions; it
would result in substantial loss of whatever "mystique"
the Brigade possesses, which might be useful in unifying
Cuban refugees; and a phasing out of this kind would
probably engender some adverse political reaction
domestically as well as from the Brigade and its
sympathizers. Also it might have an undesirable effect
on opinion in Latin America and other parts of the
Free World concerning the determination of the United States

to unseat the Castro regime, and would lend weight to
arguments that the U. S. may be leaning toward coexistence
with the Castro regime.

(2) Train the Brigade and Cubans in training as a
unit, Maintain and support them as a military reserve

component of the U. S. Armed Forces.
Considerations:

Under this course of action whater "mystique" the
Brigade possesses in the anti-Castro community could perhaps
be exploited in the struggle for Cuban liberation, and used
to bring about greater unity in the Cuban anti-Castro exile
community.

It would constitute an immediate political and
psychological advantage by demonstrating to the Cubans
within Cuba, to the Cuban exile community, and to Latin
Anericans, the U. S. determination to establish a
striking force symbolic of U. S. intent to overthrow the
present Cuban regime.

It would satisfy one of the principal desires expressed
by top Brigade leaders and would promote prestige and esprit
among its members. It would appear to be in consonance a
the statements and actions of the Administration in
connection with the future of the Brigade.

But it would inevitably become a focal point for
Cuban exile political activities in the Miami area, and
morale, discipline and esprit would be difficult to
maintain over the long term without early employment to
retake Cuba. It could generate domestic political and
military criticism by incorporating organized alien groups
in the U. S. armed forces reserve component. There is a

risk that’ an impulsive, irrational act by Brigade members,
as members of the U. S. reserve forces, could be a source of
serious embarrassment to the U.S .

(3) Tailor a special civilian and military program

for Brigade members. Encourage the Brigade to continue
as_a "fraternal" unit similar to the "Flying Tigers".
Encourage those Brigade members who enter the current

military training program for Cubans to establish a
Brigade military reserve component which other U. S.
militarily-trained Cubans could join.

Under existing authority, HEW could provide the
following additional benefits for Brigade members in
need, over and above those now offered: special emp loy-
ment counseling and placement service; extended student
loans to provide for all institutional costs such as
tuition, books, etc., even if this exceeds $1,000 per
year (living costs to be provided by another agency) ;
expanded vocational training in the Miami area; increased
financial assistance to needy persons while in training;
increased distribution of surplus food (with approval
of the Department of Agriculture).

The following additional programs could be under-
taken by HEW upon Presidential determination that such
action would contribute to the defense and security
of the United States or advance its foreign policy
interests: scholarship grants for students; loans for
vocational training anywhere in the United States; an
expanded training program similar to a G. I. Bill of
Rights, in the United States and/or abroad. The cost
of these additional programs, assuming an expenditure
of $2,500 per person per year would be about $2.5 million.



SECRET

-7-

Establishment of additional programs, after a
. Presidential determination, would increase’ costs even
more, and be subject to wider criticism as “unnecessary’
privileges for Brigade members. :

COORDINATORS'S RECOMMENDATION

1. I recommend course (3), a specially tailored
program for Brigade members.

2, I recommend against a Presidential determination
providing broader privileges for Brigade members.

3. I recommend no change in existing U. S. military:
training programs for Cubans, except that a Brigade reserve
unit should be authorized and other Cuban reservists should
be permitted to join. :

4. I recommend that the Brigade be induced rather than
forced to accept this proposal, and intend to arrange
consultation with them immediately if this course of
action is approved.

Rationale

Lacking an immediate military use for the Brigade we
should disband the Brigade as such. Since we may, in the
future desire the presence in the U..S.. Armed Forces of
militarily-trained Cubans, we should encourage Brigade
members to enlist in the existing military training
program for. Cubans and to enter.a U.S. Reserve Unit
thereafter..

Our programs should be designed to encourage
the Brigade members to melt back into the exile
community and engage in constructive pursuits
pending the liberation of Cuba. We should offer
them some special assistance but not to the extent
that they become a perpetual privileged class
within the community, Presidential action on their
behalf would single them out unnecessarily.

reported by some members of our representatio

1) The possibility that there will soon be a loosening of
the political and economic ties with the USSR appears to me
to be nil at this time, The fact that the talks with Mikoyan
were long-and-difficult and that Castro expressed in private
nis opinion on Khrushchev (wishing that Stalin were still
alive) does not mean that he can and will renounce ‘that ,
Soviet assistance which is vital to him. This assistance
cannot be replaced by the Chinese. ,

Certainly the Chinese Ambassador to Habana will have
done everything possible to convince Castro to resist (and
in fact the latter held firm on the question of inspection).
Certainly the activity of the Chinese representation here is
intense, But the Peiping Government cannot replace the USSR
in economic assistance. It does not seem probable to me
that /China7 can furnish more than it has furnished to date,

wool and silk material, and many trifles of which the stores
in Habana are full. As for machinery and spare parts, /China7
is not in a position to compete with that merchandise supplied
by the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland.

In substance tro, even if he cannot exactly be defined
as pro-Khrushchev, is tied to the USSR in such a way that he
cannot for any reason release himself. I recall in this”
regard that on 2 November, after the visit of U Tnant during
the most acute moment of the crisis in Cuban-Soviet relations,
he declared, "We are above all Marxist-Leninists and friends
of the USSR. There will be no breaches in our relations."

Given this, I feel that the statements of the vice director

of TASS as reported by lare a good
resume of the situation, 170v) a) SOvr Ws have for

some time felt perplexed with regard to Castro's character
and person because he is reluctant to be "guided" docilely by
Moscow.’ b) The USSR will continue ‘to give all its economic
support to Cuba because otherwise its prestige would suffer a
grave blow particularly in Latin America.

2) Also excluded, it appéars to me, is the possibility that
the revolutionary regime of Castro can be c

not in Ca temperament to become "non-aligned”,’ to

ze anyone, and even less to'take Tito as a model.
erefore Castro would have to be eliminated, and this
possibility Seems very remote.

3) As I noted in my 9 November report it is difficult for
Castro to remain calm, Therefore the revolutionary regime
will continue with all/means at its disposition to disseminate
subversive propaganda in the whole continent, as demonstrated
by the fact that all the states of Latin America (including
Mexico} are taking strong measures against the dissemination
of this propaganda. But it is doubtful that today Castro can
do much more and that he constitutes a real menace to the

y of other countries, if only because he lacks the

ry funds. I tend to share the opinion of the

jor to Bravil that the Cuban leaders are trying to

ate all their subversive efforts in oné country, and
that they have selected Venezuela for various reasons, includ-
ang the old ill feeling between Castro and Betancourt, I note
in passing that, according to what was told me by

during the recent meeting of the OAS the

Venezuelan representative accused the Cubans of promoting the
recent attempts in his country but, when asked to furnish
proof, he was unable to do so.

It would certainly be highly desirable if a serious
pressure action on Cuba could be exercised within a purely
Latin American framework as pointed out by

means. A partial solution would worsen the situation and a
definitive solution could be directed only by Washington. 1
think therefore that only pressure which is accompanied by
material strength can obtain results in Cuba.

In conclusion, in judging the Cuban situation it is
necessary first to keep in mind the personality and temperament
of Fidel Castro, the influence which he has on a part of the
population, and’ finally his deep-rooted hate of the United
to say that the Cuban revolutionary
regime, purged of some fanaticism, could be a good example
for other Latin American countries. This would not take into
account the mentality of the Cuban leaders and particularly
their. chief, who accepts council from no one and intends to
imitate no one. Furthermore it is too late to select another
path. As Guevara said the other day in an interview for the
Daily Worker, "this is a battle to the death with the United
States in Which the most possible damage must be done to the
adversary :

Undoubtedly, after the events of October and November,
