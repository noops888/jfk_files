b. Antin NYCZYPORUK (according to GHYP his true nano is
BYKYPCRETZ) was boro about 1910, He is marricd and had a wife and
two children in lioginsk. Pricr to 1944 he was a professor of
Unrainian and Vest urcpeen Literature at s pedegogicel institute

vas in an International Kefugee Organization cemp in Salzburg,
Austrins be bas resided is France aince 1948.

4, The following details on GRYP's and HYCZYPORUK's involvement
with Soriet intelligence were obtained by our scurce from GiYP and
other Ukrainian eaigres in France. Luring ths period 1954 to 1960 GAYP
and Vasiliy MYAKUSHO, Third Secretary of the Soviet Delegation to UTEECO,
frequently visited with each other at the Soviet Fubassy and at GHYP's ~
apartment on 211 Sue de Bercy. At the end of 1959 GYYP introduced
BYC2YPCRUK to MYAKUSHKO. MYAKUSHKD asked HYCZYPOEUK to contribute literery
articles to Soviet publications; it is not known vhether FYCZYPORUK wrote
ony such articles, Barly in ly60 SYCZYPONUK developsd a persecution come
plex and waa confined to @ cenitarium for a short period, GHP, fcering
that NICZYPORUK might expoge the GAYP-MYAKUSKO relationship, provided
RYCZYPORUK with free voard end lodging in his apartment and with spending
money. MYAKUSHXD dropped NYCZYPORUK as socn es the latter's mental con-
@ition became obvious. In Kay 1960 the Soviet iubassy advised NYCZYPORUK
Xo rezatriate to the US2R2 as soon os possible, and offered to help locate
His family in the USaR. (As you already know, in October 1960 the Soviets
