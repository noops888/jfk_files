to under the cret program arbot

hoodlums from the Pittsburgh area.

Departmental attorneys in Miami have requested that the f

Bureau interview Joseph R. Merola, a top jewel thiefs and hoodlum

currently residing in Miami, as a source of information concerning O

The Department attorneys have indicated there is

a possibility that Merola is willing to tell what he knows con-

cerning the Mannarinos.

We have talked to Merola on several

occasions in the past.

While he has not been cooperative, the

Bureau has long recognized that if he were willing he could give

voluminous information not only on the Mannarinos but on many

other criminal matters.

SAs Forsyth and Portella of the Pittsburgh Division

have in the past interviewed Merola, who has indicated that he

has confidence in these Agents.

Both these Agents are thoroughly

familiar with all the ramifications of the Mannarino cases as

well as other matters about which Merola could be expected to

furnish information.

In order to fully develop this potential,

SAS Forsyth and Portella of Pittsburgh have been instructed to

interview Merola in Miami and develop all information in his

possession.

This interview will not require these Agents to be

away from Pittsburgh more than two days.
