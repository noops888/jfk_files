a@ person in charge Although Source and the other officers

sessions, and althcugh he was given penalties for his obvious

disaffection, he never paid any attention to then. The DGT
personnel Source knew were perfectly willing to talk politics

never went on very long.

2. Apparently during 1962, there had been considerable sentiment
for Anibal ESCSLANTE and his faction, the Partido Socialista
Popular (PSP), but in 1964, the PSP group was disrupted and
the real loyalty was to Fidel CASTRO rather than to the Party.
