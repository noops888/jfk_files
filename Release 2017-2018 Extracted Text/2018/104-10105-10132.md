FROM : Richard S. Sampson
Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT : Mr. David Phillips' Manuscript

1. Following are comments on chapters 2, 5 and 11 of

this manuscript which have been reviewed in LA Division:

2. Chapter N

a. The portion on the terrorist kidnapping in the
Dominican Republic in 1974 (pages 38-41) should be
deleted for the following reasons:

(1) This incident is still fresh in the minds
of most Dominicans, and it is unrealistic to assume
that it will not be picked up and published in the
local press. Barbara Hutchison, USIA, one of the
people kidnapped, is still in the Dominican Republic,
and according to two fairly recent reports, is again
being considered as a target for kidnapping. The
potential for terrorist acts against. US citizens
continues, three top leaders of terrorist-oriented
groups are currently in prison, and publication of
this item could propel the terrorists into action.

(2) The close link between the Ambassador and
the CIA which the author portrays could be prejudicial
to his public image and might even provoke the
terrorists to target against him. “re

of this information on an obvious|_ _ i ———\
by the then Chief, LA, might lead our

contacts to wonder whether we

operations, and possibly jeopardize this relation-
ship.

(4) Although the bugging‘of the thermos was
discovered and appeared in the press, the use of
the Coca Cola case did not receive such exposure

or" >future, at least .as far as the Loe
is concerned. Perhaps the author shou e reminded

of a cable that was written during his tenure as

ov Chief, LA with regard to this particular audio 24
t operation: "BOTH EMBASSY a
BE CAUTIONED TO HOLD EXISTENCE’ THIS OP TIGHTLY AS

POSSIBLE TO LEAVE OPEN CHANCE USE THIS PLOY IN FUTURE
CASES AS WELL AS PREVENT ADVERSE ACTION BY PRESENT
KIDNAPPERS." Reference the author's footnote (page 39)
that "Philip Agee long ago revealed..." this technique,
Agee's revelation is certainly no criteria for further
disclosure.

b. The passage regarding CIA's role in countering
terrorist activity abroad should be delted. The author
singles out the Agency as "Only CIA, of American agencies
abroad, is uniquely charged with countering these activi-
ties". This could only increase the targetting of our
personnel by terrorists, and possibly lead to another
Welsh-type incident.

c. The author's confirmation of Agee's identification
of CIA personnel should be deleted as well as the author's
information on the disruption of Agency operations which
Y. resulted from Agee's exposes (pages 5-6, 41-43). Undoubtedly
"Agee and his ilk would be delighted with this gratis exposure
and derive satisfaction in having it made known to the
public, by one with first-hand knowledge, what impact
exposes have on CIA operations, morale, etc.

d. We fail to understand the author's purpose in his
references to the Kennedy assassination and Watergate,
which raises the doubt about CIA involvement in the first,

¥ and leaves the reader’ pretty well convinced that there
was involvement in the latter (pages 5, 16, 30).

the cide Agency components:

e. The following passages should be cleared with
the appropriate Agency components:
we (1) SE Division: The operation against _the a
/ GB (page 36). This operation took place in|

(2) NE Division: The Arab terrorist activity
in "Costa Brava" - which is Venezuela-- and follow-up
Y information involving the Middle East, and apparently
a telephone-tap operation (pages 36-38).

£. The author notes (page 4). that. more is being
written on Chile operations. It is requested that this
item'be submitted for review by this Division prior to
publication.

3. Chapter S*

a. There are no passages which we can require be
deleted.

b. The following passages should be cleared with
u epee 28

eae “a Reference to the Gulf Steamship Company
being used as a cover for the broadcast aspects of
the Bay of Pigs operation (pages 12 and 22). When :
checking this passage with Mr. Gordon Wohl, CCS, he:
asked that a copy of the manuscript be sent to his
component for review.

(2) Use of a New York public relations firm (not
identified by name) which was "responsive to CIA
control" (page 32). Other books and publications have
identified the Lem Jones Associates as having handled
the public relations aspects, but nowhere have we

| found it alleged to have been CIA-controlled. Some

} -articles indicate that there is actually a Mr. Lem
Jones, who was president of the firm. Perhaps the
author's allegation that it was CIA-controlled should
be deleted.

(page 52).
4. Chapter 2

a. Again, no passages were found for which there is
a solid basis on which we can require deletion. .

b. The following passages should be cleared with
the appropriate Agency components:
