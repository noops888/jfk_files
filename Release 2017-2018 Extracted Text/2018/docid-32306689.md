II, Laurentian Mountains, 50 Miles from Montreal

Information has previously been reported (page 136,
report SA ARTHUR V. HART, 5/21/59, Albany) that information was
alleged that a meeting of Italian hoodlums similar to instant
meeting was to be held in the Laurentian Mountains about 50
miles from Montreal some time after December 23, 1958, It
was also reported that Staff Inspector JOHN J. QUINN, Bureau
of Criminal Investigation, New York State Police, had
confidentially advised the Assistant Commissioner of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Ottawa, Canada, by letter
of the possibility that the meeting might take place and
suggested consideration be given that the meeting could be
at a lodge owned by GMITUSIPPEACATRONI, 345 Emory Street.
Apartment 2, Montreal, .CATRONI is:described as a notorious
aac, eeteshone oN St. Adele, North Province of Quebec,

Canada, telephone CA 273719 a4, ‘A

: AChE Law

In this con tfon it is noted that the local press
carried a brief item concerning the recent arrest of an
individual who could be identical to this CATRONI, together
with others, at Montreal, Canada, in possession of some
kilos of heroin. worth approximately $3,000,000,00. A lead is
set out to obtain further data concerning this and any
connection there may be between Apalachin hoodlums and this
Montreal oper&étion since it has been alleged that a purpose
of instant meeting was to discuss narcotics.

E, . INTERVIEWS OF POSSIBLE SOURCES

On March 11, 1959, at Galveston, Texas, Confidential
Informant Albany T-66 told SAJOHN E, FRANKLIN that he had been
in touch with BENNIE BICKERS at Dallas, Texas, on the telephone
and BICKERS informed that he had been unable to determine the
reason for JOSEPH FRANCIS. CIVELLO of Dallas having attended
instant meeting. Informant said &t appeared that BICKERS
would be unable to determine why CIVELLO was in attendance,

On June 9, 1959, T-66 was recontacted by SA FRANKLIN
and he said that approximately one month before he had been in
touch with BICKERS (a friend of CIVELLO).. Informant said
BICKERS told him he had been unable to determine why CIVELLO
