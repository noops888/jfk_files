II. Laurentian Mountains, 50 Miles from Montreal

Information has previously been reported (page 136,

report SA ARTHUR V. HART, 5/21/59, Albany) that information was

alleged that a meeting of Italian hoodlums similar to instant

meeting

was to be held in the Laurentian Mountains about 50

miles from Montreal some time after December 23, 1958. It

confidentially advised the Assistant Commissioner of the

suggested consideration be given that the meeting could be

at a lodge owned by GIUSIPPE CATRONI, 345 EmoryStreet

Apartment <, Montreal:

CATRONI is described as a notorious

narcotic-trafficker at St. Adele, North Province of quebec,

canada, telephone cA p-3741A

In this connection it is noted that the local press

carried a

brief item concerning the recent arrest of an

Individual who could be identical to this CATRONI, together

with others, at Montreal, Canada, in possession of some

kilos of heroin.

worth approximately $3,000,000.00. A lead 1s

set out to obtain further data concerning this and any

connection there may be between Apalachin hoodlums and this

Montreal operation since It has been alleged that a purpose

of instant meeting was to discuss narcotics.

Ee: INTERVIEWS OF POSSIBLE SOURCES

On March 11, 1959, at Galveston, Texas, Confidential

Informant Albany I-66 told SA JOHN E. FRANKLIN that he had been

in touch with BENNIE BICKERS at Dallas, Texas, on the telephone

and BICKERS informed that he had been unable to determine the

reason for JOSEPH FRANCIS. CIVELLO of Dallas having attended

instant meeting.

Informant said it appeared that BICKERS

would be unable

to determine why CIVELLO was in attendance.

On June 9, 1959, I-66 was recontacted by SA FRANKLIN

and he said that approximately one month before he had been in

touch with BICKERS (a friend of CIVELLO). Informant said

BICKERS told him he had been unable to determine why CIVELLO

went to Apalachin.
