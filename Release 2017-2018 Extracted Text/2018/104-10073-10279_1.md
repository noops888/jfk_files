The choice of ODA lakoto, Ox-Fulbrighter and

his own latent anti-American

foolings, pulled his up to the

extent that he has been dubbed "the emperor" by other BEISIRSK

activista, and given him at long last an iceological missior

to pursue.

lostikava has performed magnificently in feeding

ODA's ego needs and in infusing and indoctrinating ODA so

that his words and actions take on sulliciently virulent

anti-Anerican overtones; ODA has served anothor vital :

felloy intellectuals to join the ranks of BEESIREN activists.

(Attachnent 1 1s a listing of a number of thoso Japanose tho

Organizational Development:

In 1ts 2 1/2 year history,

BEREIREN has not appreciably changed 1ts organizational fornat,

although at has noved ats office throe tines and nodisied lis

PEREIREN 1s not a "mass organization", be-

'intellectual friends of ODA and YOSHIKAtA, who form the loose

body of BEFEIREN's activist Icadersbip.: Undor this BEICIREN

leadership superstructure lies a paltry base of only several

hundred BEHEIREN "rank-and-file" supporters, nostly young

Japanese students.

Organizationally, MCLEIREN has no formal

nenbership systen, so its base of supporters is fluid and not

precisely nonsurzble. However, the base support for BEHEIREN

has definitely been on the apsuing during 1907, and nade such

notable strides during the past sumer that JCP Headquarters

officials finally felt constrained to noto with concern: that

BrEFIREN was beginning to dialn off & growing number of pro

gressive youth who otherwiae would have been absorbed into

the ICp's own youth movement.

BEFSIREN leaders have tried to :

help this grouth along by setting up a youth section, calliag

"Young BEHSIREN."

BEFEIREN's Inaginative actions aud

publicity conscious programs have been responsible for its

Activities and Accomplishments:

BEFEIREN has engaged

number

propaganda actions,

and participated in inter

national anti-Viotnam Var activities.

It has trled to

operate with certain front activities in Japan controlled by

the dCP, most notably the Japan Committee to Investigate War

Crimes in Vietnam activitles,

which culminated in the Tobyo

Court of last August, but has been soundly and rudely rebuffed

by the JCh. In spite of this, BEHCIREN has churned along at

1ts own pace, with = continuing serfes of ant1-Vietnam var

actions, most of then related in some way to the American

pacifist movement.

In this regard, BEFFIREN has succeeded in

cornering a virtual monopoly on Japanese contacts with the J.S.

pacifist movements, and has effectually capitalized on this to

promote its own action program.. The case of the four deserting.

sailors, while an apparent lucky windfall for BElEIREN, only

points up the fact that BEFCIREN, through past organizational

work and pronotional activities, was "johnny-on-the-spot",

ready and capable (unique in Japan In this regard) to take

the ball and run with it. BElEIREN Ian all the way in this

case and scored its most notable success since 1t was organized.

(Attachment 2 is a listing of BELTINEN's more notable activities

B. The Case of the Four Sailor Deserters and BEHEIREN.

How It Started: The consensus of all available overt

media material,

with

no recorded dissent, Indicates that the

•four sallors voluntarily left their ship, went AYOl, and ended

up wallowing around Tokyo's hippio land. Precisely what personal

grievances prompted the four to embark on this mis adventure is

not yet known.

But, up to this polat, the four could fairly be

categorized as misguided youngsters, gone astray in 1 loreigy

land, and due to get slapped back in lIne with traditional

Navy justice when they finally decided to stop the fan and go

back to the ship.. So far, this made their cases far fron

unique.

BEEIREN Takes Over. "When the four made contact with

BEHBIREN had everything needed to capitalize on this:

T Went to Tokyo and Tried to Dissuade Them;

*(New York, November 20, Correspondent Tadashi ONODERA).

Professor

= ErnestaP.,YOUNG of Dartmouth College in the U.S:, consented to an interview

with this reporter on the question of the four American seamen who deserted

i from the U.S. aircraft carrier Intrepid.

At the interview held on the 19th,

¿ Professor YOUNG clarified that the Peace for Vietnam Association (Beheiren,

With Makoto DA acting as its representative) contacted an anti-war organiza-

tion in the U.S., and at this, Professor YOUNG hurriedly visited Tokyo, and

meeting the four

seamen in a room in an apartment house in Tokyo on the 9th

s'and l0th; tried to persuade then to return. In regard to the present where-

trabouts of these four seamen, he made the noteworthy. statement that "those

four were still in Japan, up atil the night of the lath, when I left Japan,

but they are probably no longer in Japan now is cougece to nes collares

c-Families Perplexed. '

tus i the questions and answers exchanged with Professor YOUNG are as follows:

te fra Why, did you go to Japan? ocre

Beheiren contacted David DERRINGER, a pacifist activist

'in the U.S., asking him to "send someone to Japan to hear the stories of

i:the four seamen and announce them in the U.S." I have been in Japan twice,

and I also once served as special assistant to Ambassador REISCHAUER.

During that' time, I became friends with Beheiren representative ODA' and

Trother intellectuals in Japan. It was for these reasons that I was given

this assignment. I personally have never participated actively in the

or anti-Vietnam war movement so far.. Tour

• seamen?

ICe Professor'::: I arrived. in Haneda on November 8, and met the four seamen

Gron the 9th and the loth. The place of interview was in an apartment house

pe in Tokyo, but I cannot say at this time where that apartment house was and

who owned it.: However, on both days, I talked fully with these four seames,

2e for more than three hours on each occasion (according to an investigation

nade by the public security authorities, Professor YOUNG arrived in Japan

toward the evening of the 8th, and stayed at Hotel Tanakanwa In' Shiba,

is Minato-ku, until the morning of the lith).

" Professor: The desertion was completely. the decision of these

, that they deserted really. out of doubt about the Vietnam war.

-What were the movements of the four, after they deserted?

Professor: On the night of the 23rd, two days before the Intrepid

was die

to sail, the four went to shinjuku, and told the people whom they

net at ä bar they happened to visit, that "we are fed up with war."

The

Japanese who heard them sympathized with them, and at one time, the four

lived with sone hippies (according 'to this paper's investigations; they

and vanguard artist A., who gather at Fugetsudo in Shinjuku.) Finally,

→ Where are the four seanen now, and where are they planning to go?

Professor: I am certain that the four of them were still in Japan,

up until the lith, the day I left for home. However, they already knew

fully well, that it was not possible for them to obtain asylum in Japan.

They even said that "we will probably have to go to some third nation,

which is neutral." (The public security authorities judge that the
