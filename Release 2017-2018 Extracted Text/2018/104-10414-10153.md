Subject: M.L. OLTMANS (10 June 1925)

On 29 December 1971. OLTMANS invited the Cultural Attache of

the

Russian Embassy KUZNETSOV for an evening in his house. The invit-

ation was also for some other members of the Russian Representation.

At the same

time OLTMANS was to invite some six important journalist

KUZNETSOV should ask OPALIV and IZIKOV to come along with him.

The date agreed

on originally was 11 January 1972. It then was

changed twice. When

14 January also wasn't suitable, it was agreed

on 7 January to make the date for 18 January 1972 at 20.00 hrs.

From the invitation it could only be infered that OLTMANS wanted

to offer his guests

an spot on y

an opportunity for an informal discussion.

About the background of the present

good relations of OLTMANS with

the Soviet Representation in The Netherlands, section B is able to

report the following:

(This information comes from vulnerable source - OPPERBAAS.)

1. In September 1970 OLTMANS says with some surprise that he sudden-

ly received an invitation to

a party at the Russian Embassy.

He thinks it crazy; he doesn't belong to that club at all. But

his thinking is along the lines

of those people.

2. In October 1970 OLIMANS appears to be interested in an interview

with KOSYGIN's son-in-law GVISHIANI who allegedly was connected

with American-Russian discussions about forming a mutual "think-

ing factory".

Presumably this had some connection with the so called Club of

Rome in which GVISHIANI plays a role.

Remark: GVISHIANI is chairman of the

and technology and is suspected to be a highly placed

Intelligence Officer.

3. Begining March 1970 OLTMANS contacted the Press Attache OPALEV

from the Russian Embassy; OLTMANS would still like to have an

interview with VISHIANI.

It would be a filmed interview in which OLTMANS would cooperate

with the NOS. (TV).

In this period OPALEV's cooperation does not yet seem very

extensive.

4. Thanks to the cooperation of Aurelio PECCEI, chairman of the

Club of Rome,

OLTMANS at the end of April 1971 succeeded in get-

ting in contact with GISHIANI in Paris.

Also present at

this discussion was the

former menber of the Russ

Embassy FEDEROVSKY, now chief of protocol of the state committee

for science and technology.

2.

At this opportunity GVISHIANI immediately invited OLTMANS for a

visit to Moscow.

FEDEROVSKY was instructed to inform the Russian Embassy in The

hague about it.

GVISHIANI who at the same time is chairman of the commission for

environment administration in the Soviet Union, asked OLTMANS to

make a film at the same time about the environment administration

in: the Soviet Union to support the international environment

conference to be held this year.

5. Begining. May it becomes

clear that since OLTMANS' discussion with

GVISHIANI, OPALEV's attitude towards OLIMANS has greatly changed.

OPALEV is now all willingness.

In May OLTMANS makes his film with GVISHIANI and receives an inv

itation to come to the Soviet Union for the second half of August

and the whole of September, where he could film ten scientific

institutes.

GVISHIANI told OLIMANS that he had complete trust in him.

6. In June 1971 OLTMANS again contacted GVISHIANI, this time in

Vienna, where there was a meeting of the Club of Rome.

7. Begining October 1971 OLTMANS again saw GVISHIANI in Paris, where,

among other things he spoke to him about his visit to The Netherla

in the second week of October.

OLTMANS did his best to oblige GVISHIANI while visiting The Neth-

erlands by trying to establish business relations for him (for

instance with Philips)..

receveil

8: In November 1971 OLIMANS, from

the Russian state television an

offer for a five year contract to make exclusive films in the

Soviet Union.

This offer was made to OLTMANS during his visit to the soviet

Union. It is concretization of the earlier offer by GVISHIANI to

film a number of scientific institutes in the Soviet Union.

On 17 November OLTMANS allegedly discussed this business further

with GVISHIANI in Geneva.

9. On 23 January 1972 OLTMANS will make another visit to Moscow to

discuss making the above mentioned filns without the participation

of the NOS. At this opportunity OLTMANS will leave behind a memo

about LUNS in connection with OLTMANS' present agitation against

the Secretary-General of NATO.

OLTHANS wants to prevent LUNs getting any future opportunity to

visit Moscow.

10. Referring to the meeting in OLTIANS' house on 18 January 1972 it

can be reported that on 17 January 1972. OLTMANS stated that he

is again seeking reaction from the Russians who will visit him on

18 January; their reaction in connection with OLTMANS' request

to the

general prosecutor of the lligh Council to bring action

against LUNS.

3.

In the morning on 18 January OLTMANS also stated that KUZNETSOV

said

that. OLTMANS!

action against LUNS will not

succeed because

the "bosses"

stand behind LUNS.

It is not clear when KUZNITSOV said this to OLTMANS, but it is

known that OLTMANS recently attended a meeting where a number

of Russians were present.:

(Possibly the meeting of

' the Association "Nederland-USSR" with

the delegation from "USSR-Nederland" on 14 January 1972.)

11. On 19 January 1972 it was reported that HOFLAND (one of the guest

invited to the evening in OLIMANS' house) called before his

arrival and asked whether he could bring a friend.

Afterwards. this friend appeared to be Peter ZONNIVELD from De

Telegraaf.

OLTMANS said that at the press conference which he (OLTMANS)

will give on 20 January 1972 several guests, Milo ANSTADT, Rob :.

KOPUIT and Jaap JANSEN will defend OLTMANS against the attack on

him in "De.

. Telegraaf" of this morning.

19 January 1972.
