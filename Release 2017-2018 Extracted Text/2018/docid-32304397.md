ADMINISTRATIVE

This report has been delayed due to the preoccupation
of the preparing Special Agent with other pressing matters
in.connection with the Criminal Intelligence Program
and due to the dearth of information of pertinence concerning

subject, as is indicated in the details of this report.

During the period 3/6/64 to 7/22/64, PG 713-c*
was in operation, and this informant was in a position
from which he could furnish information directly from the
pusiness office of SAMUEL MANNARINO. However, during
this period absolutely no information of pertinence was
developed. The informant was discontinued on the latter
date due to the imminence of the razing of SAMUEL
MANNARINO's office building in connection with the New
Kensington, Pa., redevelopment program.

During the period of this report, close liaison
was maintained with representatives of the Intelligence
Division, IRS, Pittsburgh, Pa., who have a continuing
investigation underway concerning subject.

The observation of subject's car on 7/22/64 was
made by SA DONALD G, FISCHER.
