PG 92-228

ADMINISTRATIVE

This report has been delayed due to the preoccupation

of the preparing Special Agent with other pressing matters

in connection with the Criminal Intelligence Program

and due to the dearth of information of pertinence concerning

subject, as is indicated in the details of this report.

During the period 3/6/64 to 7/22/64, PG 713-C*

was in operation, and this informant was in a position

from which he could furnish information directly from the

business office of SAMUEL MANNARINO. However, during

this period absolutely no information of pertinence was

developed.

The informant was discontinued on the latter

date due to the imminence of the razing of SAMUEL

MANNARINO's office building in connection with the New

Kensington, Pa., redevelopment program.

During

the period of this report, close liaison

was maintained with representatives of the

â€¢ Intelligence

Division, IRS, Pittsburgh, Pa., who have a continuing

investigation

underway concerning subject.

The observation of subject's car on 7/22/64 was

made by SA DONALD G. FISCHER.
