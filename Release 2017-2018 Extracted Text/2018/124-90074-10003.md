SECREE

Mrs. CARBO stated some firm, informant believed it was
Fiat, had given two million dollars, and it was going to
be possible to secure the twenty-eight million dollars
worth of tractors to be sent to Cuba according to CASTRO'S
specifications; however, if this failed, she understood
that Dr. ALONSO PUJOL intended to blackmail the U. S.
Government; that is, if the U. S. did not want to give
the money which was necessary, a document could be turned
over to some person who would read same at the assembly
in Punta Del Este, and the U. S. would be obliged to
furnish the money for the tractors .(~ (ot

Informant noted, of course, that no such
document was read at Punta Del Este, but he stated
Dr. ALONSO PUJOL did go from Miami to Panama, from Panama
to Cuba, and from Cuba back to Panama. MM 791-S stated
he thought Dr. PUJOL might have made the above statements
to Mrs. CARBO, perhaps to encourage her or to make her
believe that the tractors for prisoners exchange is nota
dead issue. cy

Subsequent to the conversation with ANITA “~+—+—-
CARBO, and after having received several reports regarding
the developing anti-American feelings of Dr. ALONSO PUJOL,
informant saw the document, which is enclosd herewith, and
thought there might be some connection between the
conversation of Dr. ALONSO PUJOL and Mrs. CARBO on the one
hand, and instant document on the other REX)

MM 105-5147

Informant concluded there is somedirect and
indirect evidence that Dr. ALONSO PUJOL is the author of
the document XC

SA CEORGE E. DAVIS, JR., rere | (nist arity (>)
Local representative of CIA, and was advised CIA learnéd
of the document and its contents prior to its release,
sometime in 11/61. CIA investigated after its rekase, and
ascertained it was written by the purported signer, Dr. PEDRO

MARTINEZ FRA who was,a member of the @ban Revolutionary
Council. Mr. ated at first about 90 copies of

the document were ed to a limited list of persons,
upon authrity of Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA, head of the Cuban
Revolutionary Council. Mr. tated it is now

estimated that about 150 copies have been released. It

is noted that the copy furnished by MM 791-S to the Miami
office is mimeographed and would, of course, therefore, be
indicative that other copies were made, and that as a
matter of fact, a stencil was cut with the intention of
running off more copies.

CIA believes this document may possibly have
been prepared as a political power play designed to
promote the formation of a Cuban Government in Exile;
towever, if this was the original intention, the idea is not
now being pushed. CBS 4)

7 Since CIA is already aware of this document, and
of its circulation and contents, no copy is being furnished
CIA locally, nor is any designated for them on a circulation
- basis; however, three copies of the translation of the
: document are enclosed herewith, in the event the Bureau
should desire to furnish a copy to any other agency of

the government. cya 4)
