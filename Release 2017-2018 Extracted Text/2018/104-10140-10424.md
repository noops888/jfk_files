The Commissioner's press secretary, Bernardo Guerra, indicated that he

was gathering general information on many agencies of the Executive Branch

and wished to visit the CIA with other members of the staff to "talk about the

CIA." I responded that I thought the best way to start was to send him a general

kit of public information on the Agency, which hopefully would satisfy his

informational needs. A kit was provided by A/ICI/PA and forwarded to

the. Office of the Resident Commissioner, Puerto Rico, Attention: Bernardo

Guerra, Room 1319 Longworth House Office Building.
