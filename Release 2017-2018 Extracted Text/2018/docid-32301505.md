So, for next week, he

better go see him and straighten out.

Yeah, but....

(Good morning, JOHNNY. Stranger speaks

to CAPPELLO).

Yeah.

We were there until 1:30 and the guy didn't

show up.

I ain't got no luck.

(Aside to unidentified

person, SCAFIDI says, "How you doing, buddy?" Customers

come and go during the conversation.

Conversation in

CAPPELLO's store, Ninth and Fitzwater Streets, Phila-

delphia).

What do you want, a quart or a gallon? "CAPPELLo talking

to customer in

his store).

Don't worry, JOHNNY. I'd have been here.. You know that.

I was worried. I swear to God.

I even called him

yesterday.

I mean.

don't know. But

what

I don't know don't hurt me.

Relax.

You know I would have been here and wet your

palm, buddy.

I'm not

MONTE attempted to hold up a "Jewish Guy" on night

of 9/21-22/64.

They remained until 1:30a.mg 9/22/64

Regardless,

JOHNNY, you know I'm not that hungary because

No, I wasn't thinking of that.

I went to see GNATZ (IGNAZIO DENARO, under boss La

Cosa Nostra,

Philadelphia, ANGELO BRUNO, Boss, La

Cosa Nostra (LCN), Philadelphia, and Commission

Member, departed

for Miami night of 9/23/64, so IGNATZ

did FRANK come and see you?

He said not yet. He'll

be over.

It would have been nice.

I would have paid

TONY Off.

But you see, he should have went and seen him, being

that you went down.

That's why I told you.

Did you

get in touch with him (MONTE) any time? (FRANK MONTE

should have reported his attempted holdup activity

tO DENARO like SCAFIDI did).

No, I couldn't see him.

Maybe, because... was with you, you know, he'd figure,

what the (obscene) is he doing with you....

Well, I got him protected too.

Huh?

I got him protected too. I wanted GNATZ to think that

he didn't do it.

See.

I want to wait until he talks to you.

See why the guy didn't

Oh, he wasn't with you, FRANK?

Yeah, we both. He was on the corner.

I was on the side.

The guy didn't show up.

There is something funny there.

He's there every Tuesday. All the people were waiting

for him at the luncheonette to cash some checks.

No

luck. (Customer intervenes here about steaks)..

It would

all have been allright, JOHNNY.... I went to see my.

IDA was "boss" prior to POLLINA).

Yeah. I mean JOE IDA.

You used to see him once every

I don't either..

He'll need one of his capi's.

The source elaborated on the above.

PHILIP TESTA 1s in jail. It was not known if he

appointed anyone to act as capodecina in his place while

TESTA 1s in jail.

CAPPELO is a capodecipa but has only

old men under him who give him no trouble.

Other than

FRANK MONTE and FRANK NARDUCCI (made members of LCN 10/19/61

according to PH 623-C-*). TESTA has old men under him.

In LCN when a capodecema is "away" he should have somone

to take over

"temporary" while the capodecema is gone.

PAT MASSI, who is 1n Italy has JACK WILLIAM, true name,:

JOSEPH LANCIANO acting as capo.

JACK WILLIAMS is not permanently

taking over for MASSI.

MASSI has "eight" in his regime.

This would not mean there are only eight in other regimes.

This identifies PAT MASSI, JOHN CAPPELLO, PHILIP TESTA

as capodecema in the Philadelphia family of ICN. Later

ANGELA BRUNO 1s identified as the "boss

and a member

of the commission of IN.

They've been on the commission for years and years.

He's one.

There's CARLO CABINO, there's TOMMY BROWN.
