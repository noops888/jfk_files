Information enclosed in parenthesis is explanation

What?
About 1:30 we were over there, nothing happened .
Did you go see ANGE?

I went to see him last night, and I told him.

I don't know. And I told him. So, for next week, he
better go see him and straighten out.

Yeah, but.... (Good morning, JOHNNY. Stranger speaks
to CAPPELLO).

Yeah. We were there until 1:30 and the guy didn't

show up. I ain't got no luck. (Aside to unidentified
person, SCAFIDI says, "How you doing, buddy?" Customers
come and go during the conversation. Conversation in
CAPPELLO's store, Ninth and Fitzwater Streets, Phila~
delphia).

What do you want, a quart or a gallon? (CAPPELLO talking
to customer in his store).

Don't worry, JOHNNY. I'd have been here. You-know that.

I was worried. I swear to God. I even called ‘him
yesterday. JI mean. Statec-~I don’t know, But what
I don't know don't hurt me.

Relax. You know I would have been here and wet your
palm, buddy. I'm not that way. (SCAFIDI and FRANK
MONTE attempted to hold up a "Jewish Guy" on night

of 9/21-22/64, They remained until 1:30a.m., 9/22/64

had been told by SCAFIDI if. he had made good he would
have given CAPPELLO some of the money.) Regardless,
JOHNNY, you know I'm not that hungary because

Cc: No; I wasn't thinking of that.

S: I went to see GNATZ (IGNAZIO DENARO, under boss La
Cosa Nostra, Philadelphia, ANGELO BRUNO, Boss, La
Cosa Nostra (LCN), Philadelphia, arid Commission
Member, departed for Miami night of 9/23/64, so IGNATZ
is in charge until BRUNO returns) yesterday. I said,
did FRANK come and see you? He said not yet. He'll
be over. It would have been nice, I would have paid
TONY off.

C: But you see, he should have went and seen him, being
that you went down, That's why I told you. Did you
get in touch with him (MONTE) any time? (FRANK MONTE
should have reported his attempted holdup activity i
to DENARO like SCAFIDI did).

S: No, I couldn't see him.
C: Maybe, because....was with you, you know, he'd figure,
what the (obscene) is he doing with you..o.
8: Well, I got him protected too.
: Huh?
S:. I got him protected too, I wanted GNATZ to think that

he didn't do it. I want to wait until he talks to you.
See. I'm waiting to see him. See why the guy didn't
show up. It's funny the guy didn't show up.

Ce Oh, he wasn't with you, FRANK?

S: Yeah, we both. He was on the corner, I was on the side.
The guy didn't show up. There is something funny there.
He's there every Tuesday. All the people were waiting
for him at the luncheonette to cash some checks. No
luck. (Customer intervenes here about steaks). It would
all have been allright, JOHNNY.... I went to see my

If only they (wouldn't have?) called the police.
Although you had told me that, see. So, I called him.

Agents? (Car passed, SCAFIDI asked if it was ‘Agents.
CAPPELLO says sure).

Sure.
‘Want to go up there and see him this week?

This week is Thursday already. I shouldn't go on a
weekend. It should be like on a Monday or Wednesday.

Oh. We will make it definitely Monday or something.

You louse yourself up. And then, not only that,

he wasn't going to bring it up to me, who the (obscene)

Yeah.

As if.

That's the difference.

In other words, when he gives you the OK... generally

what I mean? A little something for nis trouble,

you know, he helps them out, I mean me, I ain't with
hin. He ain't with me. So, I don! t know he's with.
(FRANK MONTE “ain't" in some regime in LCN with CAPPELLO.
He is under TESTA.)

He's with PHIL (PHILIP TESTA).

PHIL. PHIL is away, so he has to go there. (Go to see
ANGE ‘ds TESTA is in jail). I don't know.

ANGE.

I don't know. -Has he appointed anybody for that reason?
I don’t. know. (CAPPELLO doesn't know if anyone is
appointed to act as Capodecina for TESTA while TESTA

is in jail).

I don't either.

He'll need one of his capi's.

That's it. I don't know if he's appointed someone in
charge of it. He's got to go to ANGE. That I don't
know. :

I imagine he has to go to ANGE.

C: Was your old man alive when you?
8: Yeah...
The source elaborated on the above,

PHILIP TESTA is in jail. It was not known if he
appointed anyone to act as capodecina in his place while
TESTA is in jail. CAPPELO is a capodecina but has only
old men under him who give him no trouble, Other than
FRANK MONTE and FRANK NARDUCCI (made members of LCN 10/19/61
according to PH 623-C-*). ‘TESTA has old men under hin,-

In LCN when a capodecéma is "away" he should have somone
to take over "temporary" while the capodecema is gone.
PAT MASSI, who is in Italy has JACK WILLIAM, trve name,
JOSEPH LANCIANO acting as capo. JACK WILLIAMS is not’ pemarently
taking over for MASSI, MASSI has "eight" in his regime.
This would not mean there are only eight in other regimes,
This identifies PAT MASSI, JOHN CAPPELLO, PHILIP TESTA

as capodecema in the Philadelphia family of LCN. Later
ANGELA BRUNO is identified as the "boss" and a member

of the commission of LCN. CAPPELO's father was “alive”
when JOHN CAPPELLO was "madd' LCN,

YoW take like me. With me, that's why with me it
seems so...I'm in the store, A guy comes, I got

It's a real. pain in the (obscene). If I wasn't “ x
doing nothing, then it's a pleasure. I got to do. ee
Understand? I don't say I'm sorry I'm the one, ee
but then, I mean to say, it's good enough for me,

I wouldn't want to be under (boss); maybe consuglieri
because you are not too involved with something.

What would that mean, in case of trouble?

A consuglieri is like a lawyer, In case you got
a beef or a gripe.or I got a beef with you. He
hears the story, and he tries to straighten it
out. Understand? He's like a lawyer. In other Hl
words, he's like a peacemaker.

Yeah, wait awhile, I got a...VALACHI...like you
know when everybody gets together, all the big
bosses?.

Udienza? Well, there is another name, He (VALACHT)

So they get together and try to straighten it out,
You. know, somebody intervenes, and then the commission
gets together,

I didn't understand what the hell it was.
The commission makes the decision,

Oh, in other words they pick nine guys from different
states,

They've been on the commission for years and years,

»Like our family, our boss (ANGELO. BRUNO) is a

representative on there,
He's one of them?

He's one. .There's CARLO CABINO, there's TOMMY BROWN
TOMMY LUCHESE (Thomas Luchese, aka), Eight or nine

of them,

I always wondered what the hell it was. I mean,
I never, ;

JOE BANANAS is a new one.* What's what. There's

or nine. They get together, The
commission gets together and they decide what is
to be done, and that's all.

What's to be done.

In; other words,:say for instance, ANGE, some of us
(JOHN says hello to Somebody here) and there is
friction, there is fights, some guys disappear,
The commission hears about it, you know, ..they give
you a hearing and try to iron the thing out some-
