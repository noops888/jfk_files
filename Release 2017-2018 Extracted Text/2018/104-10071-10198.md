A high-level member of the National Liberation Party (PLN)
who has access to and the confidence of top leaders of his
party. His strong identification with the PLN and the
knowledge that his reporting will reach U.S. official
circles probably cause him-to present his reporting to the
best advantage of the PLN. He has submitted reliable in-
formation during the past year, but he has been known to
withhold pertinent information. He received the informa~
tion from Daniel Oduber.

5. (Field Comment: Holo has the roputation locally of
being on inveterate intriguer and a braggart. Therefore, his
veracity is open to question. It io possible that the infor-
mation ho has given to Odubor ia to some extent exaggerated
or distorted. It is also possible that Starke will find Helo
to be a less than trustworthy interwediary.)
