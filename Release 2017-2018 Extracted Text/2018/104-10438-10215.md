Attached isa letter, sent to the Embassy, a rough translation of
which follows:

c
"The 'dangerous' organizations:

"Have you thought that our world is a great community of organi-
zations. There are a great number of idealistic organizations, there are
professional organizations, there are political organizations, there are .
organizations within the business world, etc. Practically everyone in our
world now belongs to one or several organizations, 4nd the organizations
have significant pover in our world ~ one can well call them a third power
in our world.

"What I want to show you, with the enclosed picture,-is the clenched
right hand, upright, slightly leaning toward the shoulder, the thumb at an
angle over the fingers. It requires training, for the member, to execute
this organization's sign.

"I have seen this sign mde, but I can not recall where, as well
as writing paper with this emblem,

"He wants to show with this sign, all is clear (comments: could

be translated: the job is finished), but help me now.

"(If) You can get hold of this organization, which has this sign,
you have come to the solution to that terrible crime, which happened in
November 1963, in your part of the world.

"I have traveled much, you can certainly search out this organi
zation in our world, I wish you great success and sign
