B. Identification of the Mr. X in the
Anderson Column

1, The attached column, citing the testimony of a Mr. xX,
alleges that a CIA agent tried to link Oswald to Cuban intelli-
gence officers in Mexico. There is, of course, no substance to
the column's allegations. The column identifies the source as ’
Mr. X because of attempts on his life, but subsequently gives
enough information. on Mr. X to establish his identity. :

2. According to the Anderson column, Mr. X was first met 7
by his CIA contact in Havana before rciation: with U.S./Cuba were
severed. Mr. X had helped to organize bank accountants to em.
bezzle Cuban government funds to finance anti-Castro causes.
Mr. X was reportedly recruited by a Morris Bishop (CIA contact),
to plan an attempt on Castro's life. The plan was to fire a
bazooka from a nearby apartment building while Castro was deliver-
ing one of his marathon speeches. According to the Anderson
column, the plot was discovered by Castro's police and Nr. X
escaped to Miami. Mr. X also reportedly tried to assassinate
Castro in Chile in 1971 in league with the Venezuelan Luis Posada
Carriles, who is now being detained in Caracas for the 6 October
Cubana airline bombin The Anderson column ends with the report
that Mr. X worked for CIA until 1 for expenses, but was paid

From the above dese
Seclear that Mr. Yas \ntenio
VECTANA, an is g
accountants ana, first contacted ¢
in December 1900 when he asked the COS, at that time
to help in an a Sination plot against Castro. V
for visas for ten relatives of the four men as il
and also requested four MI rifles with adapters for grenades plus
eight grenades. The COS did not encourage VECIANA and subsequently
checked with an E sy officer who reported that VECIANA had made

similar “wild-cyed" preposals to him. On November 1961 the
mi News published a report of an unsuccessful attempt by -Antonio
VECTANA to kill Castro. VECIANA reportedly had arranged to
sinate Castro and Cuban-President Osvaldo Dorticos on $ October
in Havana, but the bazooka he was using failed to fire.

4. There has been no Agency relationship with VECIANA, A
POA, which was granted for his use in para-military affairs in
January 1962, expired in November 1962. iCTANA was born on
4 October 1935 in Havana. He was a member of the People's Revo-
lutionary Movement, an anti-Castro group in Cuba during 1960-61, and
was one of the founders of Alpha-66. A certified public accountant
by trade, VECIANA was with AVI.D. in La Paz in 1908-72.  VECIANA
was registered in ISR to the U.S. Army in November 1962 and he
was terminated without prejudice in July 1966, Qn 23 July 1962
VECIANA was interviewed, at.his request, by Mr. Harry Real from
the DCD New York office. VECIANA asked Real to arrange a mécting

with a senior CIA officer to d Alpha-06's plans to assa nate
Castro and to request CIA's assistance (U.S.$100,000; 10,000 Cuban
s; 48 hand grenades). .There is no indication that this request

pes

was ever acted upon by CIA.

advised VECIANA that he was in no position to provide him with
tance or encourage him in an nation attempt and was only
nterested in gathering information which he thought was the purpose
of the meeting. VECIANA subsequently said th is roommate Felix

tially to getAgency financial support for his organization.

6. There ix no indication in\the file that any Agency officer
in contact with VLCIANA ever used an alias Morris Bishop. There te
no Morris Bishop listed in truc name in the DDO rolls. There wos
never any contractual relationship with VECIANA and he was not
paid CIA funds.
