HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON _ASSASSINATIONS

INTERVIEW OF
SPECIAL AGENT DAVID N. JELLISON

On March 29, 1978, I, David N. Jellison, Special

Agent with the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, was interviewed by Richard C. Wrose,

Mark Speiser, and Wendy Collins, investigators, and

Peter G. Beeson, Staff Counsel, for the United States House
- of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations.

This interview took place at the House of Representatives
* Select Committee Office Building, Washington, D.C.

At the outset, I identified myself as a Special
Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and obtained
names and titles of the interviewing officials. I aiso
furnished my date of birth, Social Security Number, and general
background information relating to my FBI career to date. TI
specifically furnished the date I commenced my assignment in
the Miami Division as June 1966. Upon arriving in Miami, I was
assigned to the investigation of civil rights and extremist
matters as they existed in the Miami Division at that time.
In this regard, I was assigned to handling the Martin Luther King
peers investigation as leads developed in the Miami Division

I was asked to comment on any contact I had with

William Sommersett, an extremist source in the Miami Division
at the time I was assigned to investigate extremist matters.
To my recollection, regular contact with Somersett had been
discontinued prior to my arrival in Miami due to his unstable
behavior and to avoid possible embarrassment to the Bureau.

I am of the opinion that for some years prior to-1966,
Sommersett had furnished reliable information to the Bureau
relating to both extremist and criminal matters. Any direct

contact I had with Sommersett was initiated by Sommersett,

_ and any information developed as a result was accepted at
face value and either verified or discredited, as the case
may have been. To my knowledge, Sommersett.was not paid
for any information he furnished to the FBI during my tenure
handling extremist matters.

Whatever contact the Miami Police Department had

with Sommersett is unknown to me with the exception of a
bombing matter which fell under the jurisdiction of the Miami
Police Department and of which Sommersett apparently had
direct knowledge. I was shown a memorandum by the House of
Representatives interviewing officials which was allegedly
written by an Officer Sap of the Miami Police Department on
April 25, 1968, to Chief of Police Headley, wherein Officer
Sap stated he had developed information from Sommersett on
April 3, 1968 indicating that Martin Luther King would be

- killed in Memphis, Tennessee. I never met Officer Sap and
never saw this memorandum. I do not recall Sommersett or
any Miami Police Department official relating any of the
information contained in this memorandum to me.

asked about several names which were unknown to me .and was.
interrogated about any knowledge I might have regarding an
FBI "Cointell" (phonetic) Program as it pertained to the Miami
Division. I have no knowledge of this program in the Miami

Prior to the conclusion of this interview, I was

At the conclusion of the interview, I was advised
that I would be notified of any further inquiries in this
matter wherein my presence or testimony would be necessary.

Stokes, Chairman of the HSGA3 and Samuel L. Devine, Ranking Minority,

that such might preclude necessity of briefing the two Congressmen. (j

On. 4-12-78, at 11:30 a.m., this briefing-was held in the

Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations

Following the briefing, Mr. Blakey proposed several questions
concerning the operation and King. These questions were appropriately
answered. (U) 7

Mr. Blakey expressed satisfaction with the briefing and with
the Bureau's reasons for excising documents furnished the HSCA. He
stated the early association of King and Levison is crucial to the
HSCA's investigation. He acknowledged that the FBI had a basis to
investigate King and to install telephone surveillance of him. However,
he believed the investigation of King continued for too long a period
and information developed by the FBI concerning King was disseminated
too widely. (U)

Mr. Blakey desired that Congressmen Stokes and Devine be
furnished the same briefing at a future date. (U)

the Jacksonville Field Office for the pertinent period
of HSCA interest.

(2) White Citizens Couneti (WCC)

A search of FBIHQ files disclosed no nationwide
organization of the WCO. Therefore, since no Field
Office subfiles exist, FBINQ indices were searched for
all retrievable Information concerning the WCC for the
period January, 1963, through March, 1966. The resulting
4nformation, some of which was previously provided the
HSCA in response to its request of November 3, 1977,
‘concerns WCC groups in Ohio during 1965; Montgomery, -
Alabama, during 1965-1966; in Chicago during 1963-1965;
and three additional general file references.

(3) ‘Minutemen

Field Office subfiles exist in the FBI's investigation
of the Minutemen organization; however, the subfiles for
offices of interest to the HSCA contain no information for
the period January, 1963, through March, 1966. Theréfore, '
the main investigative file of the Minutemen (105-107261)
for the period January, 1963, through March, 1966, {

. (Seetions 5-46) has been processed and is available for
HSCA access. if

(4) Ldberty Lobby (LL)

The FBI conducted no active investigation of the LL.
The majority of information received at FBIHQ concerning
this group was filed in Bureau file 62-106942. A portion
of this file and pertinent references for the period of
HSCA interest have been made available for HSCA access.

(5) Black Panther Party (BPP) F
Strice the BPP was not founded until 1966, no infor-

mation condéerning it exists in filles of FBIHQ for the 7
periods and localities specified in referénced HSCA letter.

1973, Mx. Eberhardt clarified this request by eliminating
reference to COMINFIL and to Limit COINTELPRO information
to programs involving the CPUSA and Black Nationalist-Hate
Groups, Mr. Eberhardt also requested delivery of
COINTELPRO information involving King and SCLC for the
| period January 1, 1967, to April 30, 1968, which had previ-
ously been prepared for HSGA access in response to HSCA

letter of November 30, 1977.

copies of 74 volumes of documents that were in the Atlanta
file on MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., 100-5586 as requested by

FBIHQ.

Referenced Bureau teletype had indicated that in
connection with the investigation into the assassination of
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., the HSCA had requested access to
various field office files, including the entire Atlanta
security file concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., (Atlanta
file 100-5586). One legible copy of each document in this
Atlanta file was to be furnished to FBIHQ.

The Bureau also advised Atlanta in referenced
Bureau telephone call, that the HSCA wanted Atlanta to
first furnish those documents in KING's Atlanta security
file that covered the period 1/1/68 through 4/30/68, and
when these were xeroxed, they were to be sent to FBIHQ right
away. When this phase was completed, then the remaining
documents in KING's Atlanta file were to be xeroxed and sent
to FBIHQ.

The Atlanta file on MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,
consisted of 81 volumes and the documents in this file
covering the period 1/1/68 through 4/30/68 were in volumes
74 through 80. Since the KING file only contained 81 volumes,
Atlanta submitted volumes 74 through 81 with referenced Atlanta
letter to FBIHQ, 4/11/78.

One xerox copy of the following volumes of the
Atlanta file on MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., are being sent
to FBIHQ at this time:

As the Bureau will note in the above list, ina
number of volumes of the KING file, there are many serials
listed that cannot be accounted for. For the information
of the Bureau, back in 1977, Atlanta had a massive project
of retrieving communications containing electronic surveillance
(elsur) information regarding MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., and
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) per a
court order in the case captioned, "BERNARD S. LEE v.
CLARENCE M. KELLEY: ET AL (U.S.D.C., D.C.) CIVIL ACTION
NO. 76-1185 AND SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
(SCLC) v. CLARENCE M. KELLEY; ET AL (U.S.D.C., D.C.),

CIVIL ACTION NO. 76-1186". In this project, Atlanta had to
review hundreds of volumes of Atlanta files and retrieve
thousands of communications containing this elsur information
so these communications could be sent to FBIHQ, for eventual

transfer to the National Archives per the court order.
Atlanta in carrying out this project, had to use a large
number of Atlanta personnel, many being unfamiliar with
security type work and communications.

These people had been instructed to list each serial
removed from the file on a form that Atlanta devised for each
volume reviewed in project, however, it was felt that in many
instances where a cover airtel and LHM were removed from the
files, both these items would be stapled together, resulting
in only the cover airtel Serial number being listed on the
form; the LHM serial number would not be noted by the person
removing this communication and as a result it was not recorded.
Atlanta feels this accounts for the bulk of the unaccounted
for serials.
