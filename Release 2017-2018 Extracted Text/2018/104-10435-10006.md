: Cubans and the Garrison Investigation

1. As you know, Garrison continues to charge that a group

of anti-Castro Cubans employed by CIA participated in the assassination

of President Kennedy. The fact that he continues to publicize his

accusation is of course cause for concern. You are also aware of the

memorandum by

formerly stationed in Miami, the subject

of which was "Possible DRE Animus Toward President Kennedy". This

memorandum speculated about the possibility that ClA-associated Cubans

might have played a part in the assassination./

2.. For these reasons we have reviewed our full file on the

Garrison case and have compiled a roster of all 47 Cubans who have been

linked to Garrison's case in any way to date. Fourteen of these have not

previously been reported to you by/CI/R&A.

3. It is requested that full checks be run against your files, and

those of the Miami Station, against all names not so traced to date. It is

suggested that you consider all Cubans who had any affiliation with CiA

from the point of view of known affiliations with Cuban exile groups and

with each other, so that we are forearmed as well as possible before the

trial of Clay Shaw et al, with its attendant publicity, gets under way.
