SUBJECT : Cubans and the Garrison Investigation

MEMORANDUM FOR:
Attention

1, As you know, Garrison continues to charge that a group
of anti-Castro Cubans employed by CIA participated in the assassination
of President Kennedy. The fact that he continues to publicize this
accusation is of course cause for concern. [You are also aware of the
memorandum by formerly stationed in Miarni, the subject
of which was "Possible DRE Animus Toward President Kennedy", This
memorandum speculated about the possibility that ClA~associated Cubans
might have played a part in the assassination. /

2.. For these reasons we have reviewed our full file on the
Garrison case and have compiled a roster of all 47 Cubans who have been
linked to Garrison's case in any way to date, Fourteen of these have not
previously been reported to you by/CI/REA,,

3. Itis requested that full checks be run-against your files, and
those of the{Miami Station] against all names not so traced to date. It is
suggested that you consider all Cubans who had any affiliation with CLA
from the point of view of known affiliations with Cuban exile groups and
with each other, so that we are forearmed as well as possible before the
trial of Clay Shaw et al, with its attendant publicity, gets under way.
