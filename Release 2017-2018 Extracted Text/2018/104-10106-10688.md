Reference cables concern the claim of sn individual appearing at
the Consul General's office in Zurich, Sqiteerland on 4 June 1968 that
he is one Richard Case BAGELL. HAGELL was sentenced to e 10 year term for
bank robbery on 9 June 1964 and is supposedly in a federal prison in Missouri.

GARRIBON interviewed Subject as 6 witness in his investigation
eccording to @ news clipping from the CHICAGO AMERICAN dated 2 January
1968. The clipping is marked in Subjects file which is atteched. This
file also contains © copy of the summary dated 18 January 1968 pre¢pared
in research on the GARRIS08 CASE.

It would be of interest for documentation of Subject's file to
ascertain from the FBI if Subject is still in préson.

I aid not receive reference IN Cable 25955 intiialiy. Attached is
a copy I obtained from 05 Cable Desk. However, the original copy wae
routed to 685 and it is possible some one else on the Steff is already

hendling the matter.
