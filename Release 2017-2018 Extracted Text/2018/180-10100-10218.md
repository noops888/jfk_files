did as requested. Also reiterated same to group at hotel.

company and expert in manufacture of synthetic fibers.

plan a waste of time, American man contradictory, vague
about plan. Sierra honest and sincere-but gullible.

he saw him in March 10th issue of CHICAGO TRIBUNE. When
Sierra asked about identify of individual represented by
Trull, Trull talked vaguely about owner of King Ranch in
Cuba, General Wood, KY. Jarvis - Millionaire in Texas.

Now is concerned Trull involved with “impure" financial
sources. About which Sierra is concerned.

Trull story different: called by Sierra - met with him
several times in April. Began to talk about Cuban situa-
tion. Did not claim personal acquaintance but mentioned
he knew Chicago stock broker, Buddy Arvez; Gen. Wood of
Sears, Roebuck and Co., and Cleberg of King Ranch whom he
thought lost money after overthrow of Batista.

Sierra sent for Trull to Miami and asked Trull to speak to
Prio and Muah and group of Cubans.

Trull said Sierra told him he didn't need financial influence
of Trull inasmuch as a representative of Las Vegas gambling
interests contacted Sierra offering backing of $14 million
for 50% interest in gambling in Cuba if Sierra able to
organize successful ouster of Castro. Trull said he asked
Sierra whether that was the Cleveland group which controlled
gambling casinos in Las Vegas and that he may have mentioned
