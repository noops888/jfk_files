Chapter of instant organization during the past several months
has’ been only by Bureau informants, 1t is not believed that
further investigation concerning this matter is warranted. It
is noted, however, that, these Bureau informants attended func-
tions of instant organization in Dallas occasionally in accord
with their instructions from their CP leader, AUGUSTIN ESTRADA,
