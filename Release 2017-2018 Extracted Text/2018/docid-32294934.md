DATE:

Rerep SA RICHARD GORDON DOUCE, Pittsburgh, 4/4/58, and Bulet

to Pittsburgh, 4/30/58.

The matter of subject's conferences with his confederates at

the Ken Iron

and Steel Company, New Kensington, Pa., has

been the subject of considerable discussion among agenus

assigned to Top Hoodlum investigations in Pittsburgh, Pa.,

with respect to the possible use of unusual investigative

techniques.

Several preliminary surveys have been made of the Ken Iron and

Steel Company for the purpose of determining

whether unusual

Investigative techniques could be established. Unfortunately

adequate security cannot be guaranteed; consequently, confidential

or unusual investigative techniques are not being considered

at this time.

The long distance telephone conversation between subject and

the individual referred to asHTOUIE" of Chicago, I1lino1s,.

regarding the gambling situation in Havana, Cuba, was

partially overheard by TOM LATTOS, the roommate of PCI MIKE

ZERVOS. LATTOS, according to ZERVOS, heard nothing additional

as to the substance of the long distance telephone conversation

and would not be in a position to obtain additional information

regarding the call even if he wanted to. ZERVOS has naturally

protected his confidential relationship to the Bureau during

his friendship with LATTOS and feels it highly inadvisable to

press LATTOS for additional information that he does not

possess at the risk of arousing his suspicions. ZERVOS

also

feels that since he is the only one who is aware of the fact

that LATTOS overheard a portion of the conversation between

subject and "LOUIE" an interview of LATTOS, the original source

of information, would greatly endanger his

position as an

informant.
