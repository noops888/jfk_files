ACTION REQUIRED - REFERSICES

1. JAGUAR has forwarded us the attached press cuttings

by or about Jonathan Power, whose name has cropped up from

to time in our NECHAOS reporting: Jonathan Richard Adrian

Poter was born 4 June 1941 in the UK and carries a British

passport No. D430314, renewed 21 July 1969. He is a journalist

who has written for a

number of publications and has been

associated with television, but claims employment with the

Economist.

JAGUAR's only other comment was that L

the Hazlemere Group (subject of previous reporting)

stated in June 1969 that Power spoke of Cuba in a way which

suggested that he had visited there.

2. The attached documents and the above information have

also been passed to the local INFRGO representative.
