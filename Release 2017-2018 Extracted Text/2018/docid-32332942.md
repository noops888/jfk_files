Recent Information Regarding the Associates Of LA ROCCA

Engaged in Racketeering Adivities

PG Tol, who has expressed an unwillingness to appear before

any future federal or state proceedings, advised that FRANK

JOSEPH VALENTI has returned to the Pittsburgh vicinity and

is once again appearing "in the open"

and endeavoring to

exert his temporarily-lost influence in the area.

He said

that VALENTI, a close associate and one time lieutenant öf

LA ROCCA, appeared at the Red Eagle Club,

formerly known as

the Genovese Cocktail Lounge, 412 Larimer Avenue, Pittsburgh,

on the evening of February 23, 1961, and became extremely

angry when he saw the informant, with whom he has had a fall-

ing out, tending bar for the establishment. The Red Eagle

Club 1s

operated by MIKE GENOVESE, protege of LA ROCCA, who

attended the Apalachin conference during November, 1957.

The aforementioned informant advised that in order to appease

VALENTI, FIORE GENOVESE, Younger brother of MIKE, who operates

the bar, dismissed the Pittsburgh informant. Other Pittsburgh

sources ofinformation are presently being contacted to ascertain

whether or not VALENTI fits into the LA ROCCA organizational

picture for the future and whether he intends to once again

become prominent in Pittsburgh rackets.

VALENTI voluntatily surrendered himself to the Monroe County

District Attorney at Rochester, N. Y.,

on January 18, 1961.

He had been indicted in Rochester for vote fraud and was

released on $1,500 bail following his surrender to face felony

charges.

Technically, VALENTI was charged with registering

and

voting while under conviction for a felony and registering

MANNARINO brothers in the operation of their gambling

establishments in the New Kensington area. The informant

stated that he häd arranged to take movies of the wedding

and at the reception in an effort to determine the

identities of the out-of-town guests in attendance.

said that MANGINI and his bride would honeymoon in

and that a representative of the LA ROCCA-GENOVESE

organization, FELIX "PHIL" GENOVESE, did not appear as

expected, according to rumors.

PG T-3, who has expressed an unwillingness to appear before

any. future Federal or state proceedings, advised that on

either February 9, 1961 dI February 10, 1961, MIKE GENOVESE

nad flown to California to "give his oldest daughter away."

He stated that although some people would possibly think

that he was accompanied on this trip by SEBASIIAN JOHN

LA ROCCA he was not and that LA ROCCA was vacationing in

Florida.

PG I-4, who has expressed an unwillingness to appear before

any future Federal or state proceedings, was contacted upon

the receipt of this travel information relating to GENOVESE

and he advised that GENOVESE left on Thursday morning,

February 9, 1961, for Los Angeles, Calif., on a jet flight.

He stated that he believes GENOVESE was accompanied by ARTHUR D.

"ARCHIE" NELSON, his alleged front at the Phoenix Motel in

Monroeville, Pa.; that he would possibly return on or about

February 13, 1961. He said that GENOVESE told him prior to

leaving that he would give his oldest daughter away in marriage

to a young boy whom he had never met but who is "clean.".

He believed this meant that the boy is not engaged in any

type of racketeering activity. The informant said that he

believes the oldest daughter of GENOVESE is named YVONNE and

that she 1s about 20 years of age.

He said the former wife of

GENOVESE is named CARMELIA and that she resides in San Pedro,

Callf., where the wedding was to take place.

He said GENOVESE

did not mention the name LA ROCCA to him and that he therefore

did not think that anyone would accompany GENOVESE besides

NELSON.

The aforementioned information was immediately furnished to

the Los Angeles Office which advised that GENOVESE arrived

at Los Angeles on February 10, 1961, attended the wedding of

his daughter at San Pedro, Calif.,

on February 1l, 1961, and

was ataying at the Thunderbird Hotel, International Airport,

has observed "young Johnnie" LA ROCCA at the establishment

and noted that he was visiting Pittsburgh from his

Johnstown, Pa., residence during the week of February 19,

1961.

She added that he frequented a few of his old haunts

and

was evidently "business-minded" during this visit.

PG T-3 advised that officers of the North Star Cement Block

Company are extremely upset about the recent prison sentences

imposed and adverse publicity directed against highly-placed

officials of the General Electric Company and the Westinghouse

Electric Corporation for price-fixing and antitrust violations.

He stated that the North Star Cement Block Company is ostensibly

a member of "an association," not otherwise described, but

believed to be an orgarization of Pittsburgh or Western

Pennsylvania cement block manufacturers.

The aforementioned informant stated that members are engaged

in a conspiracy which may include price-fixing and that North

Star officials, JOHN CONTI and ROY VEY, are so jumpy lest

they become involved that they are making up a story to the

effect that an anonymous

caller told CONTI that a representative

of the Justice Department had been making inquiries about the

association and the membership of North Star in it. He said

North Star's representative to the association may be the

vice-president of this association and that the story that

CONTI

made up and will tell may cause North Star to puâhme

out of the association before some members tell investigators

all

they know.

He added that CONTI and VEY, along with the

PRUNER brothers, ALDO and ALMO, who are also executives of

the North Star Cement Block Company are extremely worried about

being callea before a Federal Grand Jury looking into the

activities of both the association and/or SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA.
