a member of "an association," not otherwise described, but
believed to be an orgaiization of Pittsburgh or Western
Pennsylvania cement block manufacturers.

The aforementioned informant stated that members are engaged
ina ‘conspiracy which may- include price-fixing and that North
Star officials, JOHN CONTI and ROY VEY, are so jumpy lest

they become involved that they are making up a story to the
effect that an anonymous caller told CONTI that a representative
of the Justice Department had been making inquiries about the
association and the membership of North Star in it. He said
North Star's. representative to the association may be the
vice-president of this association and that the story that

CONTI made up and will tell may cause North Star to putime

out. of the association before some members tell. investigators
all they know. He added that CONTI and VEY, along with the
PRUNER brothers, ALDO and AIMO, who are also executites of

the North Star Cement Block Company are extremely worried about
