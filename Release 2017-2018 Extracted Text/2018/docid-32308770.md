NY T-12 advised that JOSEPH LIVOTI is a well known

close associate.

ODDO also

Number 349341, was born on January 4, 1903, at Palermo, Italy.

NY I-4 advised on September 26, 1954, that JOHN

ODDo, whom he has known for thirty years, has always been

a"combination' man and one of the biggest men in the gambling

setup of the Bath Beach Section of Brooklyn.

NY I-I, on January 17, 1961, advised that the

subject was in contact with an individual known as CHARLEY

BANANAS. NY I-1 indicated that the subject, while with

BANANAS, made rejerence to TONY ANASTASIA and referred to

ANASTASIA as the "Czar.'

NY T-I stated that he ascertained

that the subject is involved in some activity on Pier 5,

New york city, concerning ANASTASIA, and is also involvec

in the Bobba (phonetic Ship Line. NY I-, indicated that

the subject made a remark while talking with CHARLEY BANANAS

that when he recently saw CARMINE, LOMBARDOZZI, "and LOMBARDOZZI

got pale.

NY T-1 was unable to ascertain what effect the

subject had on LOMBARDOZZI at that time.

on February o, 1913. He attended the Apalachin meeting on-

NY T-14 continued on February 20, 1961, that

apparently BOB and TONY went to see MC CARTHY and MC CARTHY

agreed to give them a charter to organize various bowling

alleys in Queens and Brooklyn, New York. CLEMENTE stated

that when BOB and TONY went to see MC CARTHY, MC CARTHY

indicated he would give them the charter providing that he,

MC CARTHY, would receive the ads for the advertising journal

put out by his union. MC CARTHY indicated to BOB and TONY,

according to CLEMENTE, that they could have the membership

money and that they could pay this money into the international

union, but he was mainly interested in obtaining the ads

for his advertising journal.

CLEMENTE commented that when

BOB and TONY left MC CARTHY's office, JOE CURLY was waiting

outside and that, at that time, CURLY indicated that he was

MC CARTHY's partner. CLEMENTE made the observation that

CURLY did not agree that MC CARTHY should have given these

individuals the charter for the union and this came to a head

about nine months after these two individuals started to

organize. CLEMENTE stated that PROFACI's men started to

organize a place on Long Island or in Queens and that the owner

happened to be a friend of JIMMY DOYLE.

CLEMENTE made the

comment that this individual wno owned the bowling alley that i.

PROFACI's nen were attempting to organize, was probably

EMIL LENTZ, who, CLEMENTE stated, was a friend of JIMMY DOYLE.

with numerous connestions in the underworld and unions in the

New York City area.

NY I-30 advised on February 20, 1961, that EMIL

LENTZ is a front man for JIMMY DOYLE,who has opened several

bowling alleys in Queens, New York.

CLEMENTE stated that DOYLE

sent for BOB and TONY and, with JOE CURLY and JACK MC CARTHY,

started to talk over this situation. CLEMENTE made the

observation that DOYLE immediately wanted to know what right

these individuals had to organize the bowling alley.

NY 92-646

According to CLEMENTE, PROFACI's men stated they had a charter

that they received nine months ago from JACK MC CARTHY.

CLEMENTE related that, at this point, CURLY jumped up and ordered

MC CARTHY to leave the meeting. CLEMENTE indicated that

PROFACI's men were smart and immediately left this meeting and

went back to PROFACI to explain what had happened.

CLEMENTE made the observation that PROFACI did not

trust CURLY or DOYLE and apparently had a very oid grievance

against DOYLE. CLEMENTE theorized that this grievance dated

back to the time that DOYLE was working for LUCHESE while

in the garment center and surmised that JOSEPH MAGLIOCCO was

involved in some dealings with DOYE.

JOSEPH MAGLIOCCO is the brother-in-law of JCSEPH

PROFACI and attended the Apalachin meeting.

CLEMENTE stated that PROFACI asked him to straighten

out this matter and CLEMENTE indicated that he believed that

he could get along with DOYLE, According to CLEMENIE, he,

CLEMENTE, arranged a meeting between BOB, TONY and JACK

MC CARTHY. Prior to this meeting, CLAWENTE stated that he

had determined that BOB and TONY shared an office with

MC CARTHY, but the charter for the newly orgsnized bowling

alleys was in MC CARTHY's office.

At the meeting, CLEMENTE indicated that he asked

MC CARTHY if these fellows had a charter.. When he established

that MC CARTHY gave them a charter, CLEMENTE Insisted that the

charter be given to them outright and moved to their office.

CLEMENTE stated that MC CARTHY was in agreement with this

move.

CLEMENTE expressed the opinion that he liked

MC CARTHY and that MC CARTHY was an honest man to do business

with.

He stated that MC CARTHY's only worry in this matter was

_ 56

DocId: 32308770 Page 7

## Page 8

NY 92-646

that he would receive the ads for his journal. CLEMENTE

stated that when he questioned MC CARTHY about his association

with CURLY, MC CARTHY indicated that a lot of people say that

he, MC CARTHY, and CURLY were partners and indicated that,

although this is not true, he shares various ventures with CURLY.

CLIMENTE seemed to think that probably CURLY would shace in

fifty percent of the profits derived from the advertisements

received in the journal.

CLEMENTE stated that after he and MC CARTHY were

in complete agreement he invited MC CARTHY to have a drink with

him and ascertained that MC CARTHY at that time was a little

worried that JOE CURLY would be highly suspicious if he knew

that he, MC CARTHY, and CLEMENTE were taiking. CURLY,

according to CLEMENTE, would not be to much concerned about

the organization of the bowling alleys, but would be worried

that CLEMENTE and MC CARTHY would be talking about IZZY

SCHWARTZ. CLEMENTE assured MC CARTHY that he had no intorest

at this time in IZZY SCHWARTZ, and, as far as CLEMENTE was

concerned, this ended the particular dealings with MC CARTHY.

On March 9, 1961, SAS WILLIAM A. VERICKER and

JOHN R. KINSINGER interviewed HARRY DISTIR, Day Manager,

Woodhaven Lanes, 7225 Woodhaven Boulevard.

DISTLER advised

that his employer, EMIL LENTZ, was at the present time

discussing the possibility of organizing the bowling alley

which he, LENTZ, owns. He advised that a representative of

Local 3108, Bowling Alley Employees, All t10, 165 West 46th

Street, Room 502, New York City, had contacted the employees

of the Woodhaven Lanes concerning union affiliations.

advised that the president of this union was NICK SANTIAGO,

home telephone number TW 4-1420.

Investigation at the building, 165 West 46th Street,

New York City, Indicates that there was no Local 3108 listed

in the lobby directory. Located on the door of Room 502 were

the following printed names:

discussion with one ANTHONY CARJULIA, whom NY I-32 described

AL CAPONE.

satisfied in forming a corporation with JOE SCHIPANI

and CleMENtE.

CAPONE, according to CLEMENTE, had a few

accounts in mind, specifically mentioning super markets

as being excellent accounts.

CLEMENTE made comment

that CAPONE knew one individual who was netting $6,000.00

a month on super market accounts.

On the same date, CLEMENTE indicated that he

was in contact with an individual by the name of NICK (LNU) •

According to CLEMENTE, NICK, at one time, operated 13

horse rooms with individuals by the name of JOEY and JERRY.

CLEMENTE was amazed when it was established that NICK

only made $200.00 a

week out of these horse rooms, since

a quarter of a million dollars a year, from 1941 to 1950,

passed through their hands.

CLEMENTE

stated that NICK

Indicated that he got all of JOEY's headaches,

such as

handling the politicians, police, and customers in the

very much dissatisfied with RALPH RUSSO, who is apparently

running this restaurant. It was CLEMENTE's thought that

all in the shylocking business and may be operating as a

"combination"

man and one of the biggest men in the gambling

set-up in the Bath Beach Section of Brooklyn.

CLEMENTE stated that these individuals came to

him about a number of "dead loans" that were involved In

their dealings with LIVOTI and ODDO.
