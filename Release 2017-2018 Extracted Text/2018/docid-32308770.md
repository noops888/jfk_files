NY T-14 continued on February 20, 1961, that
apparently BOB and TONY went to see MC CARTHY and MC CARTHY
agreed to give them a charter to organize various bowling
alleys in Queens and Brooklyn, New York. CLEMENTE stated
that when BOS and TONY went to see MC CARTHY, MC CARTHY
indicated he would give them the charter providing that he,

MC CARTHY, would receive the ads for the advertising journal
put out by his union. MC CARTHY indicated to BOB and TONY,
according to CLEMENTE, that they could have the membership
money and that they could pay this money into the international
union, but he was mainly interested in obtaining the ads

for his advertising journal, CLEMENTE commented that when

BOB and TONY left MC CARTHY's office, JOE CURLY was waiting
outside and that, at. that time, CURLY indicated that he was

MC CARTHY's partner. CLEMENTE made the observation that

CURLY did not agree that MC. CARTHY should have given these
individuals the charter for the union and this came to a head
about nine months after these two individuals started to
organize, CLEMENTE stated that PROFACI's men started to
organize a place on Long Island or in Queens and that the owner
happened to be a friend of JIMMY DOYLE. CLEMENTE made the
comment that this individual who owned the bowling alley that an
PROFACL's meh were attempting to organize,.was probably™
EMTTRUENTZ, who, CLEMENTE stated, was a friend of JIMMY DOYLE.

NY T-5 )Mazck: 10, 196: advised S\ WILLIAM A,

According to CLEMENTE, PROFACI's men stated they had a charter
that they received nine months ago from JACK MC CARTHY.
CLEMENTE related that,at this point, CURLY jumped up and ordered
MC CARTHY to leave the meeting. CLEMENTE indicated that
PROFACI's men were smaxt and immediately left this meeting and
went back to PROFACI to explain what had happened.

CLEMENTE made the observation that PROFACI did not
trust CURLY or DOYLE and apparently had a very oid grievance
against DOYLE. CLEMENTE theorized that this grievance dated
back to the time that DOYLE was working for LUCHESE while
in the garment center and surmised that JOSEPH MAGLIOCCO was
involved in some dealings with DOYLE,

JOSEPH’ "MAGT LIOCCO is the brether-in-iaw of JCSEPH
PROFACE and attended the Apalachin meeting.

CLEMENTE stated that PROFACI asked him to straighten
out this matter and CLEMENTE indicated that he believed that
he could get along with DOYLE, Accordiag to CLEMENTE, he,
CLEMENTE, arranged a meeting between BOB, TONY and JACK
MC CARTHY. Prior to this meeting, CLEM@ NUE stated that he
had determined that BOB and TONY shared an office with
MC CARTHY, but the charter for the newly orgenized bowling
alleys was in MC CARTHY's office.

At the meeting, CLEMENTE indicated that he asked
MC CARTHY if these fellows had a charter. When he established
that MC CARTHY gave them a charter, CLEMENTE insisted that the
charter be given to them outright end moved to their office.
CLEMENTE stated that MC CARTHY was in agreement with this
move.

CLEMENTE expressed the opinion that he liked
MC CARTHY and that MC CARTHY was an honest man to do business
with. He stated that MC CARTHY's only worry in this matter was

56

DocId:32308770 Page 7


®

NY 92-646

that he would receive the ads for his journal. CLEMENTE

stated that when he questioned MC CARTHY about his association
with CURLY, MC CARTHY indicated that a lot of people say that
he, MC CARTHY,and CURLY were partners and. indicated that,
although this is not true, he shares various ventures with CURLY.
CLEMENTE seemed to think that prebably CURLY would share in
fifty percent of the profits derived from the advertisements
received in the journal,

CLEMENTE stated that after he and MC CARTHY were
in complete agreement he invited MC CARTHY to have a drink with
him and ascertained that MC CARTHY at that time was a little
worried that JOE CURLY would be highly suspicious if he knew
that he, MC CARTHY, and CLEMENTE were taiking. CURLY,
according to CLEMENTE, would not be to much concerned about
the organization of the bowling alleys, but would be worried
that CLEMENTE and MC CARTHY would be talking about IZZY
SCHWARTZ. CLEMENTE assured MC CARTHY that he had no interest
at this time in IZZY SCHWARTZ, and,as far as CLEMENTE was
concerned, this ended the particular dealings with MC CARTHY.

On March 9, 1961, SAS WILLIAM A, VERICKER and
JOHN R. KINSINGER interviewed HARRY DISTILLER, Day Manager,
Woodhaven Lanes, 7225 Woodhaven Boulevard. DISTLER advised

which he, LENTZ, owns, . He advised that a representative of
Local 3108, Bowling Alley Employees, AYL-CIO, 165 West 46th
Street, Room 502, New York City, had contacted the employees

was in contact with an individual by the name of NICK (INU).
According to CLEMENTE, NICK, at one time, operated 13
horse rooms with individuals by the name of JOEY and JERRY,

him about a number of "dead loans" that were involved in
their dealings with LIVOTI and ODDO. CLEMENTE indicated to Nywe
that the "dead loans" were persons who were not paying
