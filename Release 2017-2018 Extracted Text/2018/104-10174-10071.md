Re "Stalin" biotaahy and/or sirlin photebook.

That leares the question whether you are supposed to be working on

completion of the "Stalin" biogranty or on the Stalin poto book, or on

both.

That is your on proference?

Da the one hand, /jon is andous to got the photo back done, and

(2) the friend who was nentloned to you at lunch the other day

1s Interested In It, and (3) we have already made a boglaning on it, and,

perhaps nost important, (4) it could be completed in less time than mould be

roquired to complete the blography.

(Incidentally, please bo particularly careful not to say anything to

anybody about the publisher who was mentioned at lunch. Sven. It could

raise a really firsiclass stirk. L'inson thinls othar publishers would

ratse hell if they lound out the Govemment had gone into competition with

then /. Very important).

On tha other hand, what are your and your father's current obligations

to Vanguard, in so the stalin biography, and mould you hates cuty in

explaining to Vanguard why and on those behalf you were taking tho norths (more

or less to do the photo book; before resuring work on the biography? It so.

that might be an argunent for completing the biography first.

Please dire no all relevant details as to the current statig with Vangard.

As far as anyone here knows, you have only oral instructions to somplete the

blography. According to my rough notes of a talk we had July 3l, you had a cone

tract seth Vanguard, July '49, calling for a book "by David & Boris Shaib" to be

coapleted jarch 1,

war es klar, daß die Sowjetunton auch ohne Hilfe der Verbündeten

In Stande 1st, ganz Deutschland su besetsen und auch Frankreich
