gesture of defiazcet; tha reeting was called aa event of "considerable
nificance* (etrong words Zor the Lozdon Z it vas referred to
ae zarkirg, or at least reflectin: *a turn ~ the vestera counter-
Attack in the cold war." *Forea,® said tre fzade the fortune

of the Congress and crystalilzed ak the delegates.¢
Trevor-Ecper, in a letter te th on ite article, was” *
such more temperate than in Ris art - For example,
inthe Zcchozist he declared, "We were alsost all united against Comunisn
from the start,”

At thie point, it should be specified thgt from. the time the Con-
gress was first discussed, it-was récognived that the Comminist press.
would indict it ae a fasciet, war mongering, proragaiida group operating ander
4 the intelligence auspices of the T. S. and that this accusation vould te
et brosdeast by the Communtot- machine (as 1t wade) vaether or not, in fact the
2G Tial controls. It wes also recognised that
Congress would inevitably receive a certain
arcunt of attenticn fron the préss. It seexs to be clear, however, that thia
amount of attention was unnecescarily large.

itis significant that:

a. He played a cost irportant role in tha conception, develop-
ment, organization and control of the Congress. Without his active
interest and support the launching of the Congress would have been ,

: in the eame connection I assime that our con-~

The decision on this is not up to me, I will ap;reciate
opportunity to disouss it with yous _
Ry point of view ig that ALL of this current PNCUICK stuff

is.prenature and a caso ofa lot -of hungry actors smelling
. easy money and wanting to get ‘into the aot and get tho show én

u the road.

~ lL o<:Ne have no du t for PDQUICK for. thia period - and lfterally,
are living on borrowed funds, ‘o oan't make up a tidget because
we have no accounting from the-field, do not know where we. stand, © ~~

Here are some othor quéstions in my mind: Hebi rat
What wore the, publicity accomplishments of the relatively

. expensive NY office?
What happened to the-Bérlin news coverage by. US correspondents?

What happoned to the bright and sanguinary forecasto. cf,
tremenéous amounts of publicity, speoial magazine articles. radio

droadoastay wors to emanate fror the attendance at the i
Congress of alittle matter |
_“"wbioh cost tho rou of Ritues 7 (It seems

olear that their attendance was absolutely worthless otherviso,)

Wheat happoned to thelr efforts to obtain delegatés from
the Middle East? - A

Lo Why! ata eri Teoaes with a dozen last mimite invitations

"> © extrenely dmportarit people) inoluding’ several wives.

for: Did 1t take place? -— : ti

| There were no photographs. of the book displays. This. book et :
display was an axpensive item, Did it take. place? i a

Now with ll, these questions in my mind, adding up to a”
realisation that if the Congress was a success, it was only a
success as far as it went, and it haa a long way to 50 to completely
7 natify itself ~ the next steps. NOT being spending a lot’of dough for

he support of. désorving intellectuals who have no other source of ihcore,
- pat in getting @ distritition. of a million pisces of literature, and ©

other publicity, in Satellite areas = I would hesitate (which ia ©
a euphemism for blankly object) to blandly appropriating an extra
ten thousand bucks to support an innocuous group of Nussian exiles who

want to air their grievances, NOT under our control,

took place under conditions which shoved a cone!dereble leck of
Amagiaation and ignorance of carlianentary procedure on the part
of those reeponaidle for the vay in which the bustnesa of the
Congress wae transacted. Skegza, Mublen, on bondy are certainly
nice follows with the best intentions. However, they seen to

_ ‘At a cortain zonent, the detates tock a very unfortumte
ce turn. Onone of the f-equent occasions, when Foestler vas given
the floor, ho read s. pazer vherein he attacked Socialien in
general and the Fritioh Labor Government in particular. Considering
1} that bout 706 of tho delegatos vere poogle who professed ‘i
Socialis’ opinions; 2) that tho purpese of the Congress roquired
that a unity of all denocratic intellectcals, both socialists and
non-socinlists in the struggle against totalitart{anisn be euphasised
and 3) that tha chairaan of tho Congrows sa3 irnet Reuter, head of
the social denocratié city government of Berlin — Koestlor'o attack
was absolutely out of place and aho:}d not have Deon made regardless
of vhether he was right or not, Asa cutter of fact, the paper in
question proved that Koestler 1s mictoken tn assuaing that a brilliant
Journaliet and a successful rovelist 1s eo ize qualified to play the
role of a philosopter, historian ont sociologiat. In addition,
Q ‘ mistaken sta‘emonte by British Labor regarding the problen of
Yuropean unity donot Jrotify in my opinion the kind of vitrielic
all-out attack againat the dritish Labor Government which vao made
by Koestler who.deens to have forgotten, that, regardless. vhat one
“may ‘think of sone of ite policies, British Labor is today one of tha
principal pillars of*the world denoctati¢ front.

‘Fyideatly Keeatlar's attack provoked tacediste reaction on the
: partlof the Socialist Congress dolegstea, beginning with Reutor who
: was in the chair, ‘In my opinion, this entire discussion vas complately
2 unnecesunry. The British conservative . P., Arery, showed mich
i i potter judgeont than Kosctler by atadfadly avoiding in hie pronounce-
: ments, any eriticisa of the Labor Government. If an attitude oinilar
to that of Koeotler would have been adopted in the trade union field, :
the I.C.F.7.U, could not have beon created. As in the labor rovenent,
the organitation of intellectuals for. the defense of democracy cannot
be succesafel unlese it to understood that decocratic socialion is a
poverful infiuencé asong the best intellectuals of Europe and Asia
and that, therefore, everything should be done to secure cooperation aoe
of all derecratic forces in srite of all ideological differences. I
wae rather astonished tc find thyt irving scomed to like Koestle:
discourse on soctaliax. I spoke with quite a number of dologates and

fouhd that they didn't like it at all.

“Instead of apoointing on the first and second days of the Congr:

@ resolution Comittee which would have been able to work seriously
‘on any draft resolutions, propoeale and suggestions made by the

Gelogatos, a draft manifesto and draft resclution vore subsitted te a

Reoting appeitited soe cornittees who had exactly one heur's tine to
amend the resolutions. Of course, Ho ‘serious work of re-writing and
completing the resolutions’ could be done under such circumstances,
You vill notice that the manifesto treate the quection of cultural
freedom principally from the point of view of the Journalist and 1
from that of the scholar aad the artiotd. At leaat this io my. opinion,
A draft appeal to the. intellectualo behind the Iron Curtain, which waa
submitted by Skeggs, evoked an imbediate sharp eriticies on the part of

essential to retain tho apzoarance of a conplotely private venture, I

gould not be done readily without Ir. Lasky'a cooperation. I aleo

. Suggested that since Er. Lasky to ny knowledge wes sponding gore of his.

“me

&m contiming the discussion, it waa clear that in working alone
had ao yet beer auble to naka eny ceneiderable progresa
on bekel? of the Congress, and that there was urgent seed for (a) a
Binimm etaff to.bindlo the rrecrem in this country ani (b) a emall

“-gllocetion cf funds to Pex for telgphons, stetionsry, publicity, eto,

Until the present tice, Professar Fock has been cerrying the entire
expense and verk hitealf;iand asparertly has hed to be extrecely careful
about such itena ao long detenes telorhone ealia. For example, be felt
he could afford to telephone Hasta snd adk hin

te. sponsor thé Congress (akiech izvitetion accepted,) but
he ‘heaiteted to put cut the larger Ans to telephone in”
California, Fo would also like ve call the Congress headquarters in
Berlin, but felt thet the transitlanite toil charge was quite beyond
hie sean, et . fa i

Suggested that % sold neod.a socretary-typtiat for tuo
‘Ba 2 pablic relations ‘mien a part-tie baste for tho ease period,
Be thought the cecrstary :could te obveined for $250 8 ranth and the pub-
‘Ttetty man fer less than $500, In addition, $00 vould be suffictent for-
Such itexs as rottal of typeuritats, stationery, telephone calla; postage,
ete. This would Inke a total bulect of £2,000, The réntal expense could
be reducet, he thought, ty usin: the offices of The Ney Leader, a Soctalist
publication-ef wiick ha 18.one ef the editors, fe did not think 4t advies
able to Mve'a pretentious office, ainee obvious affluence would incite
suspicion, Tho setivity could be organised-by énericana for Intellectual
Fresdaa, of which be is the founder, The group staged the anti-Comuntat

Whiteun holidays, 27, 28, and 29 itay, has beon and is the ‘subject of a

tajor proysganda offensive by the Rugsians and by Germs communists.

It has follewed the characteristic Soviet pattern of creating confusion

and ‘tenseness on the part of the propaganda targets achieving’ this ‘cb= -™

- jective by alternating telligerent threats with peaceful, platitudes.

The threats have ranged fron doclarations that the conmunigt youta would
stern imperialists out of Eerlin to outright statements that
they wouls seize the “estora Eerlin governnont and restore the city to

a unified, peaceful capital of Germany. The peaceful declarations. have
stated that the demonstration of 559,000 toys and girls (from all over ~
Gerneny, and fron other countries) vill chiefly take place in Eastera
Berlin and will consist of rally-narching, sports evects, fireworks, and
huge peace’ meetings. Peraission was requested ty the FDJ, of Oberburgor+
