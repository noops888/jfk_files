On March 15, 1961, PCI CLIFFORD FINKLE, SR.,
owner of the Passaic Terminal and Transportation Company,
Inc., Bloomfield Avenue, Allwood, New Jersey (a large local
Cartage Agent) advised SA NORBERT R, LINKER, that he is one
of three representatives of management on the six man
Board of Trustees of the Passaic and Bergen County Branch
of Local 560's Welfare Fund, He stated that in this capacity
as a Trustee he meets with all of the union officials and
fellow board members as often as twice a month at the
union's Welfare Fund Office, 591 Summit Avenue, Jersey City,
New Jersey, He related that the board is presently composed
of ZIGMUND PSKOWSKI, also known as "ZIGGIE"; JOSEPH SANTIELLO,
also known as "“STIXIE", and EDWARD HUGHES, all of whom
represent Local 560; ALBERT SCALETTI, owner of g trucking
concern in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey; AL CHINI,

(owner of Moon Carriers, Clifton, New Jersey, and himself,

: - He advised that JACOB FRIEDLAND, attorney for the
local, attends the board meetings and presides over disputes
arising over welfare rates, medical eligibility problems
and many operational procedures.

FINELE stated that although unable to prove his
suspicions at this time he believes that the funds assigned
to the Welfare Fund are being misappropriated by the |
recipient of the monies before they are disbursed to insurance
companies, dentists, etc., or they are returned to the union
officials in the form of a kickback.

n ~ _,, He ptfered the following reasons for his suspicions:

LO be BRT

/ ie A. ALETTI and MARCHINI readily agreed to accept
the 33°centS, employee contribution rate, demanded by

PROVENZANO and PSKOWSKI even though it meant that a two cents

loss would eventually be incurred by every owner operator

within the sphere of the local.

FINKLE explained that practically all trucking
_ company employees must now contribute 33 cents per hour,
eight hours u day, five days a week, to the Welfare Fund
for every member of Local 560, which the firm employs. He
stated that a large firm such as his must therefore contribute
as much as $25,000.00 a year, or more into a fund which they
cannot audit to determine how the funds are spent, :

Cc

Docld:32309677 Page 4


NK 92-937
NRL:

FINKLE stated that the irony of the. rate increase
is that: as a member of the Trustee Board he continues to
refuse to pay the two cents rise in the rate and has not
been bombarded by strike threats by the union.

He stated that he did not know whether MARCHINI
or SCALETTI are paying the increasedrate, but doubts that
they are.

B. As a trustee of the Welfare Fund he signs

almost all of the Union Welfare checks payable to the physicians,

‘dentist, and the union optician,

FINKLE stated that he has signed checks for
as much as $12,000.00 payable to a dentist on the rolls of
the Welfare Fund for one month's services to 560 members
and their families, He stated that he possesses no conclusive
proof, but feels that theexorsitant fees charges by the
dentist must require them to kickback some per cent of the
fees to the officials responsible for their selection as a
participating dentist.

FINELE stated that he was nut attempti to be
facetious when he stated that any dentist making $12,000.00
a. month would be the richest man in the profession over a
period of one year.

C. He explained that under the present system
voted by and adopted by the local, the 33 cents an hour
Welfare Fund rate is broken down as follows:

Eleven cents goes to the Pension Fund, approximately
six cents to dental expenses, one cent for eye care, and the
remainder is allocated to the medical and hospital insurance
handled by the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.

FINELE stated that he has from time to time
attempted to query MARVIN ZALK, Administrator of the Welfare
Fund, to learn the methods by which contributions from
employers ae handled and reflected; whether bills from
dentists are checked for accuracy before checks are drawn for
payment and the general. bookkeeping procedures for the funds.

FINKLE stated that on every occasion ZALK has

D
Cover Page

Docld:32309677 Page 5


NK 92-937
NRL :mrma

politely refused to satisfy him and passed off his questions
concerning the fund's bookkeeping operations with a statement
to the effect that every administrative procedure is handled
by his secretarial force to his (ZALK's) satisfaction and
that FINKLE need not concern himself with that phase of the
fund's operations,

D. FINKLE stated that in an effort to prove to
SA LINKER that something is radically wrong with the operations
of the fund, he produced a three inch by six inch booklet
entitled, "Trucking Employees Welfare Fund Dental Program".
He offered the booklet to SA LINKER for his perusal and
pointed out that page seven of the booklet reads as follows:
"with this authorization card (referring to the members of
the Program). you will receive a list of names, addresses and
telephone numbers of the participating dentists and the
dental plan office",

"Call the participating dentist you select for an
appointment. You will. get. a prompt appointment and we
assure you that you will be treated with the utmost courtesy",

Upon completing the review cof the booklet, FINKLE
pointed out that to his knowledge no member of Local 560
has ever been furnished a list of participating dentists,
He stated that in order to prove his point he would call
Doctor LEO MARCUS, the Administrator of the Dental Program,
at the Local's 591 Summit Avenue office and FINKLE stated
that he would pretext the call by indicating to MARCUS that
many of his employees have requested that a list of the
fund's participating dentists and their addresses be: posted
at the terminal in order to save time, in selecting dentists
of their choice,

FINKLE called MARCUS' office, telephone number
OL 3-4330, in the presence of SA LINKER and asked for Doctor
MARCUS, When informed that MARCUS was out, FINKLE identified
himself to MARCUS' secretary and proceeded to explain the
pretext. Upon completion of the call FINKLE stated that
she informe¢ him that a list of the participating dentists
was not available to the men and that they were required to
first appear in Doctor MARCUS' office for examination and that
they were then assigned to a dentist by Doctor MARCUS,

He pointed out that this policy was a clear

E

NK 92-937
NRL: mrmd

contradiction to the procedures outlined in the Dental
Program Booklet.

E. Regarding the eye care phase of the Welfare
Fund Program, FINKLE stated that all members of Local 560
and their families are entitled to eye examination and
glasses whenever prescribed,

FINKLE presented the question, Why is there only
one optician, PHILLEP7APFEL and Company, 210 Fulton
_Street, New York Man » qualified-to~examination and maké
glasses for membéfs7of the Local? He stated that here
again when signing Checks payable to APFEL he has noticed
that APFEL has an extremely lucrative business through his
affiliations with the local and has always been curious to
know whether APFEL kickbacks a percentage of the fees
charged to representatives of the union, responsible for securing
his services. :

At_that point, FINKLE produced a 14 page typewritten
report entitled, "Investigation and Report of Delinquent (,
Accounts for the Welfare Fund of Local 560, for the period of |; }\'
February 6, through March 8, 1961 prepared by SOSEPHUIARAN, fT

" Ft vten

FINELE pointed out that MARAN is a $150.00 a week
employee working under MARVIN ZALK and is responsible for
the collection of delinquent Welfare Fund accounts, of which
there are always many.

SA LINKER reviewed MARAN's investigation report
and observed he had subheadings for each delinquent account
which included the name of the firm, the address, and the
date the account last contributed to the fund, That was
followed by a narrative stating further the date he inter-
viewed the official of the delinquent firm in an effort to
collect the funds and wherever his contact did not
result in either obtaining a check in the amount due or
he had not secured assurances from the officials to whom
he was addressing, that money was forthcoming, MARAN threatened
the individual with suit against the firm.

Two exceptions to the threat of suit were noted
during the review, the first was in his comments concerning

"Pursuant to the instruction to the Board of
Trustees, court proceedings have been started against
OfTILLO and Sons, Russo Trucking, Smith and Jordan, and
South Orange Express,"

"The union does not have any signed contracts with
PETER PETRIZZO or Redbird Trucking so no legal action could
be taken against these two companies,

"An infozmal arrangement. was worked out with Redbird
Trucking, whereby Redbird would pay its current contribution
and $250,00 per week toward its old unpaid balance of
approximately $20,000.00,

"To date the Welfare Fund has not received any
payment from Redbird Trucking, either on their current
contributions or their old ‘unpaid balance,

"I would suggest that a signed contract be obtained
from Redbird and suit instituted,"

MARAN's preface continues to discuss several
other trucking concerns and the fact that they were all put
on notice that unless they paid their account a suit would
be instituted,

FINKLE thon made available a document dated
March 6, 1961 directed to the trustees of the trucking employees
of the Passaic and Bergen County Welfare Fund which lists 32
companies delinquent in their payments to the Welfare Fund,

One of the firms noted was Redbird Trucking
(no address), telephone TU 7-0020, which according to MARAN,
last paid into the fund on September 3, 1960, Tune document
points out that Redbird hires a tctal of 47 men on Local 560's
union rolls, :

It is to be noted that in MARAN's preface to his
investigative report dated iiarch 6, 1961 he indicated that
Redbird was in arrears in the amount of $20,000,00 and that
"informal' arrangements had been made whereby Redbird agreed
to paysits current contribution plus $250,00 towards its unpaid
balance,

Passaic, Bergen, and Hudson Telephone Directories on
March 16, 1961 in an effort to locate the address of the
Redbird Trucking with negative results.

SA LINKER made a pretext call to telephone
number TU 7-0220 and received no answer, FINKLE then
produced a copy of an unsigned letter from Lehman Brothers
(investment advisory service) at William Street, New York City,
directed to Mr. MARVIN ZALK, Administrator, 591 Summit Avenue,
Jersey City, New Jersey, and was dated December 18, 1957.
Carbon copies of the letter were directed to the members of
the Welfare Fund's Board of Trustees.

The letter points out that a list of the securities
and evaluations are submitted as an enclosure, The unknown
representative of Lehman Brothers indicates in the letter
that his firm's fee for the supervision of the portfolio of.
the Passaic and Bergen County Welfare Fund Pension Account
would be $2,000.00 for the period of December 1, 1957 to
November 30, 1958, payable quarterly in advance,

The enclosed Lehman portfolio dated November 2,
1957 reflects purchases of 56 common and preferred stocks and
bonds amounting to $583,201.50 with a book value of $615,740.09.

. The above figures reflect the stock purchases made
by Lehman in behalf of the Passaic and Bergen County Welfare
Fund Pension Account,

FINKLE then produced eleven Passaic and Bergen
County Welfare Fund Pension Accounts, audited reports, all
of which were prepared by BERNARD TORRACO, Certified Public
Accountant, 257 Central Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey.

FINKLE advised that TORRACO handles all of Local
560's accounting matters, The review of the consolidated
audited report dated May 31, 1958 (the May 31, 1958 audit is
the last one in the possession of FINKLE) reflects that the
assets of the Passaic and Bergen County Welfare Fund totals
$303,887.05, the Pension Account reflects assets in the
amount of $870,519.15, with a total assets for both the
Welfare and Pension Accounts of $1,174,406.,20,.

perusal of SA LINKER were the minutes of the Trustee Board Meet-
ing, held on March 6, 1961, ‘The letter in part pertains to the
Administrator (ZALK) reporting to the trustees that. CLIFFORD
FINKLE and ZIGMUND PSKOWSKI, Attorney JACOB FRIEDLAND and ZALK
attended the closing on February 17, 1961 at the office of the
Union Title, Guaranty Company, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

with reference to the loan to the U. S. Glass and Chemical
Corporation. The Administrator read to the trustees a memo
from JACOB FRIEDLAND dated February 20, 1961, which outlined
the documents examined by him concerning the closing.

The minutes reflected the Administrator advised
the trustees thet a check in the sum of $400,000.00 was
turned over to the U. S. Glass and Chemical Corporation as
consideration for the note and mortgages executed by said
company to the fund.

On March 24, 1961, PCI FINKLE was recontacted and
made available three eighteen inch by twelve inch grey
colored booklets entitled, "Trucking Employees of Passaic
and Bergen County Welfare Fund" for the year ended November 30,
1960, which were prepared by BERNARD TORRACO, Certified
Public Accountant, 257 Central Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey, The
sub headings on the booklets are as follows: :

Welfare Fund and Dental Fund
Pension Account
Consolidated Audit

FINKLE pointed out that the Consolidated Audit
booklet reflects the over-all financial picture of the
Welfare Fund and the Pension Account at its most recent
examination by TORRACO, Local 560 Accountant. During the
course of the review of the Consolidated Audit, it was noted
that under the column Assets, the Welfare Fund’ contains
$497,633.53, The Pension Account contains a balance of
$2,028,462.85. ‘he combined total is reflected as
$2,526,096,38, The total liabilities are reflected as

the minutes of the trustee board meeting held on March 6,

1961 which in part pertained to Local 560's loan of $400,000.00
to the United States Glass and Chemical Corporation of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

FINKLE stated that on February 17, 1961, he, PSKOWSKI,
ZALK, and FRIEDLAND arrived at the Union Title Guaranty Company,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to close the note with U. S. Glass.
He said that he thought it unusual that shortly after arriving
at the title company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ZALK and
FRIEDLAND left him alone while they had a lengthy secretive
discussion with officials of U. 8S. Glass in another area of the
office, FINKLE explained that initially two representatives . ) boo
of U. 8. Glass, one DAVEASHINDLER, a resident of Long_Island,_“’ Ze
New Jersey, and JAC K ‘TMAN, the owner of a large hotel in
- Jamaica, West Indi Sy contacted the union and informed them
that they weré desirous of obtaining a $400,000.00 loan from
the union for capital improvements, and understood that the
union was making available such funds for this purpose.
FINKLE explained that SHINDLER stated that his firm needed such
capital due to the influx of foreign glass and that it had
become necessary for his firm to obtain more modern equipment
in order to compete against the foreign products,

FINKLE explained that although he did not participate
in the negotiations for the loan at the outset, he finally
approved the note which required U. S. Glass to pay the sum
back within a period of five years at six per cent interest.
FINKLE stated that he was informed by FRIEDLAND, the Attorney
for the local, that an investigation had determined that
U. S. Glass’ net worth was estimated at approximately $8,000.000.
FINELE stated that he was further surprised at the clandestine
type conference held at Pittsburgh when they arrived but was
unable to state that he knew there were any irregularities
involved in the issuance of the note. He further related
that he did not know whether SHINDLER and/or YETMAN were in
any way affiliated with the behind-the-scenes operation of
the local nor did he know at this time whether any of the
union's officers had an interest in U. S. Glass.

Regarding MARVIN ZALK, “ FINELE advised that he has
understood that he is related to JACOB FRIEDLAND, the Attorney,
and it was through FRIEDLAND's influence that ZALK was
reinstated as the Administrator of the Welfare Fund.

was commonly referred to as the Green Ticket, FINKLE reculled
that prior to the election, ABAGNALE requested permission to
post his ticket'"s candidates throughout the terminal, He
stated that he granted ABAGNALE the authority to do so;
however, shortly after the posters went up, PAUL CIAMPI,
then Business Agent, now deceased, barged into his office
and demanded that FINKLE remove the posters and discharge
ABAGNALE,

FINKLE stated that based on ABAGNALE's apparent
dissatisfaction with the operation of Local 560, he suggested
that he be interviewed in an effort to determine the extent
of his information concerning the illicit operations within
the local.

FINELE stated that since the date of the March 15,
1961 interview, he has not been requested to sign checks
payable to participating dentists; howover, will remain alert
for the names of the recipients of all checks which he will
hereafter sign. FINKLE stated he will also attempt to
discreetly ascertain any pertinent procedures or irregularities
within the local, FINKLE concluded by stating that the
audit reports disseminated and discussed in the earlier portion
of this memorandum are available to the writer for review
and could be returned at the next meeting.

On April 10, 1961, PCI FINKLE telephonically
contacted SA NORBERT R. LINKER who advised that he had
just returned to his office after having signed approximately
thirty checks at Local 560's Welfare Fund offices in Jersey
City, New Jersey. He stated that the majority of the checks
were made payable to members of the medical and dental
profession who rendered services to the local's members and
their families during the preceding month, FINKLE stated that
in an effort to comply with SA LINKER's request, he wrote the
names of the following recipients and the amounts due down
on a piece of scratch paper. He stated that he wasmable
to obtain all of the names due to the fact that MARVIN ZALK
periodically entered the office area and feared that ZALK
would become suspicious if he had observed him transcribing
the names of the recipients of the checks which he was then
signing. He stated that he attempted to be selective in
that the majority of the individuals, whose names he had
obtained, received the largest amounts of money.

FINKLE stated that he is inclined to believe that
TONY PROVENZANO, head of Local 560, and JACOB FRIEDLAND,
Attorney for the local, were entertained by JACK YETMAN,
the owner of a large hotel in Jamaica, West Indies, prior to
closing the $400,000.00 loan due the U. S. Glass and Chemical
Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. FINKLE referred
SA LINKER to the conversation of March 24, 1961 when he
advised that YETMAN and one DAVE SHINDLER, officers of the
U. S. Glass and Chemical Corporation, were the individuals
who had initially approached the local in an effort to secure
the $400,000.00 loan. FINKLE pointed out that his reason
for believing that PROVENZANO and FRIEDLAND had been enter-
tained by YETMAN was due solely on the fact that during a
conversation between YETMAN and FRIEDLAND at Pittsburgh, :
Pennsylvania, YETMAN displayed an article written by DOROTHY
KILGALLEN in which she commented favorably on YETMAN's hotel,
name unknown, in Jamaica, West Indies. He stated that
FRIEDLAND perused the article and commented that he and
TONY (assuming he was referring to PROVENZANO) had both
thoroughly enjoyed their stay and did not believe KILGALLEN
had exaggerated his establishment's facilities,

FINKLE stated that he did not know the significance
of this trip nor did he, at this time, know whether eithor
parties to the loan were in any way actively engaged in the
other's operation but thought it worthy of mention to
SA LINKER,

Hackensack, N.J,., and uses this address in connection with all
of his business activities, PROVENZANO has a wife, MARIE
MIGNERONE, who is about 35 years old and three children. His
wife and children reside at 45 Lockewood Place, Clifton, N.J.
The owners of this residence are listed as ANTHONY and MARIE
MIGNERONE but ANTHONY MIGNERONE is, in fact, ANTHONY PROVENZANO.
PROVENZANO visits his wife and children about once each week,
He purchased the residence on Leckewood Place for his wife and
children some time during 1957, His wife is a former Canadian
citizen who at one time resided in Montreal, Canada,

On November 12, 1952, NK T-2 advised that ANTHONY
STROLLO, aka, Tony Bender and ALBERT ANASTASIA, prominant New
York City racketeers, contretled Local 560 of the IBT. According
to NK T-2, STROLLO and ANASTASIA were responsible for the selection
and election of PROVENZANO and ANTHONY CASTELLITTO, aka, "Three
Fingered" Tony, as delegates of Local 560. NK T-2 said that a
close friend of his for the past two years, had been having a
great deal of trouble with CASTELLITTO, who was trying to prevent
him from working, According to the informant, his friend advised
him that he contacted TONY BENDER and told him about his difficulties
with CASTELLITTO which prevented him from working. BENDER then
sent this individual to CASTELLITTO and told him to tell
CASTELLITTO that BENDER said that he was to get work. According
to NK T-2, after this incident, his friend was able to work
regularly and never had any further difficulties with CASTELLITTO.

On May 21, 1960, NK T-3 advised that PROVENZANO was
friendly with and associated occasionally with JERRY CATENA and
FRANK ERICKSON and other well known racketeers,

JERRY CATENA attended the Apalachin meeting in
November, 1957.

FRANK ERICKSON is a well known New York gabling
figure.

In December, 1960, NK T-4 advised that TONY PRO was
a “very big man. in New Jersey" and had tremendous strength and
control, Informant said that by this statement, he meant that
PROVENZANO was connected with influencial racketeers in the state
of New Jergy.

On February 7, 1961, NK T-4 advised tht he had heard
that someone was working against PROVENZANO in attepting to take

over the control of Local 560 from him. Informant stated that
PROVENZANO got his job as President of the local through JOE
"SOCKS" LANZA and other "prominant New York City mob figures",
who dominate New York,

On September 11, 1954, NK T-2 furnished the following
information:

He stated that the local is headed by JOHNNIE CONLIN,
who is also a Second Vice President of the International AFL
Teamsters Union, CONLIN is an older man in poorthealth and is
not expected to continue in control of the local much longer.

MICKEY SHERIDAN, a delegate of the local, has recently

been set up as president by CONLIN in an effort to establish a line

of succession, However, the informant stated, the two Italian
delegates, "Three-finger TONY" CASTELLITTO and TONY PROVENZANO,
have the strongest backing and are expected to take over the
entire local When CONLIN dies or resigns.' He stated that if
CONLIN were a younger man and were not nationally prominant as

a Vice President in the International AFL, he would probably have
been disposed of forcefully by the Italian faction of the local
long before now, There is also some fear of reprisal from mob
elements backing CONLIN. He said that CONLIN originally obtained
leadership of the local through the backing of CHARLIE "THE JEW"
YANOWSKI, who was an intimate friend of CONLIN before he was
killed in a gang shooting in about 1948,

avraoneernot0, aka. To: 2 » & known New York
City hoodium, is now believed to be backing CONLIN, but STROLLO
is also pushing PROVENZANO and the Italian faction to succeed
CONLIN rather than the SHERIDAN group. The informant states
that PROVENZANO was originally from New York City. He was a
professional fighter in his youth and was taken under the wing
of the Greenwich Village hoodlums lead by STROLLO, at that time,
He later worked for the STROLLO mob in New York, and STROLLO
originally had him placed in Lecal 560 through CONLIN as a
shop steward at H. P. Welsh Company. PROVENZANO rose allegedly
in the local because of his backing and soon became a delegte.

The informant stated that a delegate's job is a
highly coveted one and is given as in the case of PROVENZANO
for services rendered to the mob rather than for friendship
alone and as.a result PROVENZANO is under constant obligation
to STROLLO, The informant recalled that at one time about a
year ago when he was unable to obtain employment through Local 560,
he went directly to STROLLO with whom he is acquainted and STROLLO
had him put to work immediately through PROVENZANO. After going

to work with STROLLO and PROVENZANO's backing, he was not
required to pay the monthly dues.

The delegate's position pays a salary of $275 monthly,
plus $75 weekly expenses, three months vacation, and a new
Cadillac furnished each year, The delegates also make side
money out of the "gypsy running" racket. Under ordinary union
procedure, gypsy drivers from out of town are not allowed to
make local deliveries without a local union driver. The companies
regularly employing gypsy drivers make arrangements through the
delegate handling the terminal to let the gypsy complate the
delivery for a set financial consideration.

The informant stated that the current financial status
of the local is carefully guarded by the official, and if any
member makes inquiry in that direction at a meeting, he would
be told to "shut up" or he would be forced out of work; and if
he. becomes persistent, he is thrown bodily out of the meeting by
bouncers hired by the official, His union book is subsequently
taken away fromhim, The informant stated there are several
sets of books kept by the union for various purposes and on
one occasion when he asked to see the books,he was shown a set
in which the latest entries wee more thai two yearsold, He
said the monthly dues were $4.00 per member and the local is reported
to have about 18,000 paying members, However, only 11,000
appear on their records, The recorded members can be distinguished
from those not recorded on the records only by examination of ‘
their individual books, Such an examination would show that i
at some of the larger terminals the last checkmen on the seniority
list will have the stamp space initialed by a delegate rather
than the stamp which should be placed there when their dues are
paid, Those books with the initials represent the non-recorded
members, This situation exists because the local buys their’
stamps from the International for about $160 each, and stamps
are purchased only for the number of members actually appearing
on the local's records. The dues from the members who do not
receive stamps are not collected by the shop stewards at the
various terminals as is the usual procedure, but the dues
are collected by the delegates personally. The informant stated \
that money received from these members did not go into the i
union's funds, as there was no record of their membership. i

By letter dated July 9, 1959, the Criminal Division
of the U. S. Department of Justice furnished information indicating
that a Mr. WALTER DORN,President of the Dorn Pransportation |

Com any testified before the Senate Select Committee on Improper
Activi’ des in the Labor or Management Field indicating that he
