1, The LN Department hes no means of direct radio
communication with its own agents, Uf it wishes to send a message
to au agent, it passes the message to the Mlegal Department, and
that office sends the message for LN, either ‘to the LN agent
directly if he has radio facilities fer receiving it, or to an legal
i Department agest (with whom thare Is direct radio communication)

for passage to ihe LN agent, The LN Departrent, when in
> 1963, for example, it wished to send a message te YON Sosa,
passed then message to the Dlegal Department, which sect it to
an agent with radio communication in Guatemala to relay to him,

2, The Diegal Departmort has its own radio atation for

: communication with its agenis, The stativa 1s not in any of the Fi Fc
headquarters’ bulidings; its actual location is not known, Even

when the Illegal Department and the LN Departmest were com-

bined in the MA Section and shared offices, the members of the

section handling iegal agents were very unwilling to talk about

} communications in any way,

i 3. In the Zapote Operation, agent commun!caticn brake
down because of several factors, As planned, the three agents

: in the cp-ration were to use tha same post office box as a cover

: address, but each agent was taught a separair a/w system, The

4. It was planned that Roque DALTON, “MONTENEGRO, "
tpal agent in the Zapote Operati was te do the letter
writirg. the cther two agents were to pass their information to
him, The first letter received at DGI (Cuban Intelligence Service)
headquarters was picked up at the accommedation address in
Mexico and forwarded to Havana, where through sume confusion

it was misrouted to the Dlegal Department. From there it waa
eventually furwarded to LN, The Salvador Desk officer sent the
letter in tts envelope to LQ requesting processing and identtfying
the letter as belunging to the Zapote case, from SARAVIA (the
second agent), and ashing notification as to whether the letter
contained secret writing. The LQ analysts, examining the letter,
equated Zapote and "MONTENEGRO" (although SARAVIA was

also part of the Zapote Operation) but checked with the desk
officer and with him agreed to develop the secret writing with the
SARAVIA developer, They beheved that the letter contained :
secret.writing because it was folded with the legal text outside
and the Dlank side inside as if to protect a secret text. When

the letter was tested with the SARAVIA developer, however, no
secret writing appeared, The techniclans then tried it with the
"MONTENEGRO" developer, but by this tine any secret wrilirsys
the letter contained had been destroyed by the incorrect process
They identified the handwriting as that of SARAVIA, and the

text indicated that there was an3 w enclosure, Meanwhile,
"MAURICIO" had reported from Mexicc that DALTON had been
arrested and deported from E] Salvador,

3. A second letter from SARAVIA was also received ard
tested with the SARAVIA developer, Although there were in-
dications that it contained a/w, nothing could be recovered,
There was 20 s/w on the envelope, which had net been opened, A
third letter from SARAVIA, folded tn the form to contain s/w,
was also developed and showed signs of but so faint that tt
could net be read, The desk officer thought that perhaps when
DALTON was arrested SARAVIA had taken over hig a/w apd was
using M instead of his ewn, The LQ analysts commented that
SARAVTA was using for commurtucation with DGI headquarters 2

DALTON was out of El Salvador and other miedns’ of communication
‘ was lost, DALTON was ordered to. Mexico and the desk officer

i me arranged @ trip there to.get explanitions of what had-happened and

--_ Mexico for the meeting in March 1964, however, DALTON and
the other Salvadorans he wanted to see did not show.up. The case
officer also wrote a stiff memorandum to PINEIRO complaining
about the quality-of the s/w aystems and training. His letter

HE was returned with an endorsement by PINEIRO saying that the
te id matter was being looked into and results could be expected. Up.
to April 1064, however, nothing concrete had been achieved, as
far as the desk officer knew; he heard nothing from LR and was
unable to resolve the matter directly with the agent in Mexico
because the agent never appeared for the scheduled meeting,

° - 6, All agent sommunications from the field to accom-
modation addresses in Mexico or elsewhere are picked up and
forwarded through the field station to headquarters without being
opened, In the Sonia Operation, for example, when the agent
wanted a meeting in Mexico, she sent a letter to her accom-
modation addresa there; the lettes was picked up and forwarded
to headquarters; when it had been developed at headquarters,
the desk officer informed the case officer tn Mexico of the time,
date, and place set by the agent for the meeting. In no case
