the calls were OSWALD's aor the following reasons:

a. ‘The caller wanted visas, and-.spectfically for Odessa.

OSWALD was séeking a visa and never in any ste context did

he specify the Black-Sea port of Odessa as a destination.*

b. The call was directed to the correct Soviet consular
number: 1$-60-55. On a, Ly October, OSWALD first called
the wrong number, 15-69-87 (the MA's number), and ‘had to
redirect his call.to the. correct number, -15-60-55. .It seems

a. 27 September 1963 (Friday). After arrival and check-in

to his hotel, OSWALD went first to the Cuban Imbassy where he

talked with Mrs. Silvia DURAN. The time of his first Cuban.

Embassy visit is unknown. ‘he time of his sécénd Cuban Embassy
: visit was about 1600 (i.e:, just before closing). Sometime
between the two Cuban Embassy visits, aa Mrs, DURAN's indica-
tion, he must have visited the ‘soviet Embassy. We have coverage
only on the second Cuban Embassy visit. We have no indication

who jee Sees with at the Soviet Embass: Cimere was no .

photographic coverage of OSWALD's entries into either the Cuban

or Soviet Embassies on the 27th. The lack. of coverage on the
Cuban installation is explainable: the camera, based on the

recollection of officers still in service in Headquarters, was

calls, at 1031 and 1045, to the Soviet Embassy. He identified
himself twice during the secend call when he taikta with

vation when she finally admitted before the Commission that

the ODUM photograph was not RUBY, was that the photo had been
cropped differently from the one she had been shown in Dallas.

between Headquarters and Mexico City Station a3 the

summer of 1964 in particular from 23 September to 15 October 1964
when the Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

In acceding to the Commission's request for a deposition

Mr, HELMS, then the Deputy Director Plans, replied affirmatively
to Mr., RANKIN by memorandum of 23 June 1964 which including
the following additional observation: :
“The Central Intelligence Agency recommends
that this sietescten not be reproduced in the -
Comaission's report because it would
jeopardize a most confidential and productive
operation. In addition, it could be embarrassing
to the individual involved who as far as the

And the photo operation did, as predicted, go down the drain.

Within a week of the public appearance of the ODUM Exhibit

No. 1 and Cemuseiel Exhibit 237, menbers of the Soviet Embassy
began systematic efforts to survey the surrounding’ buildings, .

ostensibly for rental space, but cléarly their inquiries

were direéted to spotting possible camera sites. The operation
was as in any case. Within a year it had become almost

totally unproductive in covexaye on Anericans in contact with

the Embassy - a clear sign that this category of visitor was

being warned away the the Soviets themselves.

personal contacts with OSWALD.

y 5S eginning if March and amplified in May 1967, ‘the
American Congul., Benjamin’ J. RUYLE, in Tampico developed: a contact

a with adocal Mexican’ journalist,- oscar CONTRERAS Lartigie, who claimed ae

to have encountered oswaLo with other PFO-CASTRO students at the

University of M x1 CO” campus in September 1963.
A
8% in June 1969, CONTRERAS was interviewed - by a CIA officer:

‘He studied. law at the Unviorsity of Mexico for eA Bae =

ia three years; approximately 19. 0 - 1964. lie belonged

to .a clandestine pro-CASTRO Revolutionary group at:

the University. Regarding the OSWALD case he was’ ”

extremely cautious and although-he wag not able or

willing to give dates and names, he said OSWALD i i i
visited the University of Mexico campus shortly a

after the Cuban’ Embassy refused him-a visa to-

visit Cuba. OSWALD made inquiries regarding

”' ptozCuban’ reolutionary groups at the University

and was directed to CONTRERAS and His friend.
OSWALD met CONTRERAS and four other persons as fie
they came out of a round-table discussuion héld a :
in the faculty of Philosophy. OSWALD told the
group it was urgent that he visit Cuba and the
Cuban Embassy denied him a visa. He requested
aid from CONTRERAS’ group. CONTRERAS and others
mistrusted OSWALD because they felt he was a CIA
provocation. The group allowed OSWALD to
accompany them the rest of that day, that night
and part of the next day. OSWALD was very oF
introverted and appeared to.be slightly crazy.
OSWALD made no mention of an assassination plot

but kept bringing up the pmmim point he had to aoe

travel to Cuba immediately.



At this

int, with FL( knowledge, the mateer was turned

ever to the Mexican authorities who determined that CONTRERAS wag

indeed at the University of Mexico but only for the years 1959 =
1960 and that he had been publically ag wold in protest activity
for the Student Revolutionary Bloc (BER) in January 1961. However,
the group ceased, functioning ag such in the middle of 1962 and
Oscar CONTRERAS was never one of its leaders. No further work
