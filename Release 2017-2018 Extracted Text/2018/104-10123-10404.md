I heartily agree with this proposal but there is one item
which I feel might. be explored. When I was in the Special Security
Center we occasionally called on the then Chief of Personnel
Security Division, Mr. Steven Kuhn, Mr. Leland E. Bunn, or Mr. Ward
K. Greene to conduct defensive briefings. In the course of con-
ducting such briefings, I feel that it is possible that they might
not be able to give meaningful answers to questions propounded by
the persons being briefed. I would recommend that this matter be
discussed with Mr. Bunn, Mr. Greene, and Mr. Kotapish, successor
to Mr. Kuhn, prior to debriefing them of all operational access
approvals and giving them GYECONs »)
