CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE MATTERS

DALLAS DIVISION

Re Dallas letter to Bureau, 7/10/63.

On 7/17/63, PHILIP STEPHENS BOSCO (DL 165-92) ,

PHILLIP STEIN (DL 165-37) and MARVIN RALPH MARSHALL

(DL 165-134) were arrested by officers of the Dallas PD

Vice Squad on charges of vagrancy and investigation

of bookmaking. They were arrested on information •

furnished the

Dallas PD by the Dallas Office as to their

operations and locations.

Following their arrest, each

man was interviewed separately at the Dallas PD.

MARSHALL

and BOSCO were quite hostile and appeared to be very upset

over being arrested. Both refused to furnish any informa-

tion or discuss their gambling activities or their back-

ground in any manner.

StEIN on the other hand appeared to

be quite cordial and receptive towards development as an

informant. He stated he would assist the FBI on a confidential

basis in furnishing information concerning gambling activities

in the Dallas area.

Dallas has opened a new 137 case con-

cerning STEIN and will continue efforts to develop STEIN

as an informant.
