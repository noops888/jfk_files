I. The following is provided for your information and

pertains to an assessment of the information contained in

Office of Security files relevant to the request from the

Dade County Sheriff's Office pursuant to their investigation

of the death of Johnny Roselli.

all Agency information pertaining to several Cuban nationals.

A review of Office of Security indices in this regard dis-

closed the following:

a.

Ramon Don Eestevez Dominquez--Office of

Security records were negative.

b. Rolando Masferrer Rojas--Covert. (36: 859)-

and overt (352 772 security files were located

regarding Rolando Arcadio Masferrer (Rojas), aka:

Roland Rojas Masferrer, a Cuban citizen born

12 January 1918 in Holguin, Cuba. Although

limited national agency checks were conducted on

Subject in January 1950, there is no indication

that Masferrer was ever

utilized.by the Agency.

Party member (expelled in 1945), a former com-

mander for Batista's private army!

and firmly

anti-Castro. The two files contain numerous FBI

reports regarding his activities in connection

with an attempt to invade Cuba in 1960 and a

subsequent effort to invade Haiti in 1967.

Masferrer and 75 of his followers were arrested

in January 1967 in Marathon, Florida, while

plot was approved by the U.S. Government (varying

•between the CIA and the FBI as the approving

agency). While the CIA approval claim was untrue,

concern, at the time, centered around the

possibility of unfavorable publicity and the

compromise of sources and nethods if the Agency

revealed that he died in 1975 when his car was

-blown apart by a bomb in Florida. No further

details

regarding his death were contained in

information

regarding Luciano Nieves Nestre, date and place

of birth 6 October 1933, Santa Clara, Cuba.

national who had been arrested, tried, and

sentenced to 20 years in Cuba for allegedly

being involved in an anti-Castro plot. He was

released in March 1965 after serving approxi-

mately. It months of his sentence and went to

1966 he was of operational interest to the DDO.

d.

Jose de La Torriente--Security records

contain only sparse information provided by the

Domestic Contact Service in 1970 showing that

one Jose de La Torriente, not further identified,

claimed to have worked for the CIA for many

• years. An attachment to a 1970 Domestic Contact

Service

memorandum containing details of Torriente's

claimed

association with the Agency was not con-

tained in Office of Security files. It is

believed that a decision to release information

"regarding Torriente would have to be deferred to

the DDO.

Quintana.

Security records.are negative.

& Manola Artimes--Security records contain

overt

(611 523). and covert. (210. 838). files

regarding Manuel Francisco Artime-Buesa.

Artime-

Buesa is a former Agency operational asset

utilized by the DDO during

the approximate

period 1959-1963. Any decision regarding the

release of information regarding Artime-Buesa or

his present whereabouts should be deferred to the

DDO.

cryptonym--AMLASH, is the subject of the Office

of Security covert file 101 080.- Cubela is a

rather celebrated Cuban national and operational

contact of the DDO mentioned throughout both of

the Senate Select Committee assassination reports.

Although Cubela is identified in the assassina

tion reports as AMLASH and his identity has never

been revealed by the Agency, his true identity

has been surfaced in several recent news articles.

All information on Cubela in the possession of

the Office

of Security would fall within the

purview of the DDO, and it is believed that any

Cubela should be deferred to the Latin America

Division of the DDO.

It should be. noted that

during their investigation, Senate select

Committee staffers reviewed Cubela's raw files

from both

the DDO and the Office of Security.

Dade County Sheriff's Office repre-

sentatives requested the "names of the three

Cubans mentioned in the Roselli testimony."

It is believed that the response to this ques-

testimony.

3.

Additionally, the. Dade County Sheriff's Office repre-

sentatives

ask for all Agency information pertaining to several

individuals of unknown citizenships, but believed to be U.S.

cItIzens •

A review of the Office of Security indices in this

regard disclosed the following:

2..

Fred Black--Office of Security records

revealed only newspaper clippings contained in

the Robert G.

showing that Fred B. Black, Jr., a consultant

with North American Aviation, was a close

friend and business associate of "Bobby" G.

Baker.

Black was mentioned repeatedly in the

news media coverage of Senate investigations

of Baker in the early 1960's.

While Black's

citizenship is undetermined, it is probable.

that he is a U.S. citizen.

b. Edward Morgan--A covert security file

(46: 394) was located regarding Edward Pierpont

Morgan, date and place of birth 28 May 1913,

St. Louis, Missouri. Morgan, a U. S. Citizen

The Covert Security Clearance was amended and

approved in March 1951 to include Morgan's use

in providing covert legal support for opera-

tions in the form of a "cut out"

, legal advice,

transmission of funds, and other assistance of

a legal nature in connection with DDO projects.

Since Subject may have been utilized by the DDo,

it is felt that any decision to release infor-

mation regarding Morgan should be deferred

the DDO.

It is noted that while only the afore-

mentioned subject file exists regarding Morgan;

in his capacity as Robert A. Maheu's personal

attorney, Morgan is mentioned sporadically in

the Maheu, Harvey, and Rosell files.

In 1967

Maheu was

interviewed and advised that he had

briefed Morgan regarding the details of his

involvement in the Agency-sponsored Castro

assassination plots.

Morgan's current asso-

ciation with Maheu, professional and/or personal,

is unknown..

Morgan is currently practicing law

in the District of Columbia law firm of Welch

and Morgan.

C.

Joseph Shimon--No Office of Security

subject file exists regarding Joseph Shimon,

aka:

Joseph Shiman.

However, he is mentioned

in the Johnny Roselli file as

a personal friend

of Roselli. It is further noted in the Roselli

file that. Shimon knew Maheu, but the nature and

extent

of their official/social relationship is

unknown. Shimon is described

as a former

District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Depart-

ment (MPD) inspector who was discharged from the

D.C. MPD as a result of a conviction involving

wiretapping activities.

To date, no decision has been made as to the type and

form of response

to be made to the Dade County Sheriff's Office

request. Additionally, a formal request to the Office of
