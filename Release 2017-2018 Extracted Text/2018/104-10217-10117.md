MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 3 Status of AECALL-1 Rangom Negotiation

1. On 26 August 1970, $120,000 ransoa was
paid for the release of AMCALL-1. $70,000 of this
@mount was paid by the Agency and AMCALL-l's wife
arranged to obtain the remaining $50,000 from
August Vanistendsel, a prominent Belgian with high
level Vatican connections interested in AKCALL-1
who presumably provided the additional money. Al-
though there was no firm commitment as to the exact
time ACALL-1's release would be effected, AMECRU-1
anticipated hig release within 60-90 days after
Payesnt of the ransom.

2. Although 6 months have now elapsed since
AKECRU-1 delivored the money to the Cuban negotiator
in Paris, there was no way to determine the reason
for the delay in AKCALL-i's release until AMECRU-1
wes able to retura to Paris to discuss the matter
vith the GOC representative authorized to negotiate
the ransom cases. Since AMECRU-1 now resides in
Miawi he ie no longer able to maintain as close
contact with the Paris official as was the cage when
ke lived in Barcelona. However, he did arrange a
trip to Paris in January to discuss the status of

1 and other ransom candidates with the GOC

representative. While the talks were still in
Progreas, th¢ case officer in contact with
AMECRU-1 wet with him in Paris on 28 January. Since
the Station has consistently been advised to
avo: idication of CIA interest in any ransom
ease, other than AHSOUR-1, little concrete information
was obtained regarding AMCALL-1l's status or the GOC
tine table for his release. After AMECRU-1 concluded
hig Paria talks the early part of February he left

for Caracas where he is expected to reuain until the
latter part of March before returning to Miami.
Although @ full report on the resulta of his Paris
negotiations can not be obtained until he returns

to Minwi, AMECRU-1 has n touch with AXCALL-l's
wife and QUPILL-1 the jasset handling the
AXSOUR-1 case. Accor 0 AMCALL~1'a wife, ANECRU~1
advised her the GOC representative in Paria indicated
the delay in releasing AMCALL-1 was partially based
on the fear expressed by certain GOC officials of
ANCALL-1'3 potent leadership in exile rovenents

if he i@ freed. As a rebuttal to this GOC argument
AXSCRU-1 wrote a letter to Hanuel Pineiro, the DGI
Director in Cuba, stating that AHCALL-1 had no desire
or intention of engaging in political activities

after his release and wished to seek employment vith
gone European social research organization. A lL

from August Vanistendael verifying AMCALL-1‘s intentions,

with assurance from Vanistendsel that he would assist
in resettling AMCALL-1 in Europe, was attached to
AWECRU-1 letter to Pineiro. Th{ lcase officer
obtained copies of the AMECRU-L letters to Pineiro
from QUPILL-1 and forwarded thea to Headquarters.

3. AWECEU-1 also told AMNCALL-1°e wife that
the GOC Paria representatives offered to retazn
the rangom aoney if the interested parties were
not satisfied with the current progress of the
case. The ramifications involving any dewand for
return of AMCALL-1l's ransom and termination of any
further efforts to obtain hia release are cossiderably
greater than was the case with ANPANIC-7 whoas entire
yansom wag provided by the Agency. In the case of
AUCALL-1, there would be no vay to demsad return of
our share of the ransom without exposing Ageacy
interest until such time as the Catholic contributora
indicate a desire to recover their $50,000 investment.
Hot only did Vanistendael‘s letter fail to indicate
any concern in this respect, but clearly expmsized
bia continuing deep interest in obtaining AEALL-l's
freedom, AHCALL-l'g wife is also insistent tast his
chance of being released not be dering
this precarious stage of the negotiation end that
any decision concerning return of the ransom be
detersined by AMECRU-l's evalustion of GOC intent.
Although AWCALL-1's wife has always been discreet
and her relationship with the Agency cooperative and
above reproech, her understandable anxiety over her
husband could lead to extrene resentment should any
attempt be aade to recover the Agency’s share of
the ransom at this juncture. This ecald be perticularly
true if the Catholic contributors show no alarm over
their investwent or the present lack of progress made
in effecting AMCALI-I's release.
