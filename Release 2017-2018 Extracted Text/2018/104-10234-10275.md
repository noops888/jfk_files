inforcation provided, and assured him that ve vould advise him
within one veek of USG interest, or lack thereof. we expressed 1
our feeling that alnost certainly the reaction vould be a negative
one. No other comitnent vas nade to Davidson.

Ke formerly vas registered as an agent of several foreign governzents,
put he recently resigned these com-issions. He frequently reports

that this particular information was beyond the scope of the Bureau's
Jurisdiction.
