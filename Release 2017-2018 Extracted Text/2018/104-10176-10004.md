3. The product of LI2IIG-4's efforts to case the

LIRING consulate will be revieved in a separate dispatch

which vill also transnit floor plans and dravirgs o. that

LIRING component.

There is little question that the eug

of LIBING 3'8 arrest in Guaterala gained LIBING 4 tbe aya

pathy of varlous members of LIRING iDcluding LIBING-3, -9

They seer to understand LIBING-4'e desire to postpone

her departure for PBRTON after baving receired her long awaited

PBRUNEY visa.

The problem now is to have LIlISGA leave for!

PBRÜKEY while LIRIXG-3 is still incarcerated in Guatemala.

mentloned in & recest cable, BOrToy has encouraged LIRING-4's

plans to try to visit LIBISG-3 in ja1l in Guatenala City ag

BOWTON feels that LIRING 3 will probably urge LIBISG 4 to

spend in PBRUNEN at least some of the tive he bas to spend in

As for the conduct of Sergio TALDEZ (BEe BOTTON's reporte

dated 19 april and 6 lay), it appears that the latter has delib

erately been provocating LiBIG.

As this Station sees it,

VALDEZ's purpose was to

try to "shake up" LIEISG4 in the absence

of LIRING3 to test her reactions.

It is doubtful that he acted

SECRETH

RUMA • 345311

According to reports subnitted to Wallace B. ROTOS by

LIRING 3, the latter set Carlos Nanuel Persaval Varcue origigally

through the latter's sister-in-law, Carmer'lozada de Ranirez,

who had been carrying on an extra-marital affair gith LIRING 3

since early Jovcaber 13÷7.

On the evening of 3 Narch 1960,

Persaval approached LIRISG-3 in connection

with the difficulties

that a young Guatenalan wonan living

in Mexico City was having

in staining false documentatior to enable her to travel to

Guatemala to recontact her husband,

whon Persaval described as

"an important

guerrilla leader"

Persaval revealed to LIBING 3

that he had been assistirg the FAR in propaganda work in lexico

for some time and

gave LIRING3 several copies of a pamphlet !

"Violencia en Guatemala" which Persaval said had been

published on one of his uncle's presses and was being sold at te

nominal price of three lexican pesos to help raise money for the

3.

When LIRISG3.

under ROSTON's direction, responded

favorably to this initial

appros"?,

Persaval pursued

the natter

and finally, on

§ April, reveal.

that he was in touch with two

clandestinely to Guaterala.

to guide these persons across the Guatemalan border south of

Chiapas, an area LIBING3 had previously told Persaval he was very

faniliar with fron his previous residence in San Cristobal.

Persaval made no further reference to the

of the FAR leader®

night actually have been the wife of francisco Lara Barrios, but

that plans for her return were discarded in favor of the trip

by Lara himself.

At ROTTO''s urging, LIRING3 insisted on reeting the tro

involved and in talking to then before undertakirg

such a mission.

Persaval finally introduced LIRISG3 to Francisco:

Lara Barrios on 17 March 1968, and the latter presented LIPISG-3

to a certain "Rodolfo"

, who bininG ascertained subsequently zs

a member of the l3th of lovember group headed bj Yon Sosa by the

nane ofxSandoval.

Francisco Lara Barrios confided to LIBING 3

that he had in his possession a false Guatenalan passport in tbe

name of Jose Maria Oliva Carranza and that be had obtained legal

residence in Mexico with his wife and children through the efforts

of ex-lexican President Lazaro Cardenas.

He also named a certai

& Eskenazi and LIREBEL-1 as persons wno assisted Guatenalah exiles

• in derico.

Station believes Eskenazi may be identical with

Luis DavidlEskenassy Cruz, a former agent

with the approval of ROUTON, LIRING3 agreed to belp

the above-mentioned persons to cross the lexican/ Guatemalan border

and to accompany them to Guatemala City.

This latter extension of

the original trip was nade by lara at the suggestion of LIRING 3

so that the latter could meet with the FAR voran responsible for

logistics.

LIRISG 3 reported to RONTON subrequently that just

before their departure, lara also offered to arrange for LIRING 3

to travel clandestinely to the Sierra de las Minas to neet directly

with FAR and 13th of lovember leaders to discuss further support

that LIRING3 might be able

to provide through his corsercial

contacts in Chiapas and northern Mexico.

LIRING 3 fabricated a false Mexican Identity document

(Secretaria de Education) for Francisco Lara Barrios in the

name of Jacinto Rangel Cervantes with Lara slightly disguised so

that the latter could move about more unobtr sively on the Herican

side of the border just prior to crossing.

On 3 April 1958,

just prior to their scheduled departure dale, Francisco Lara

To dot a

informed LIRISG3 that their mutual friend Bodolio Sandoval.

would not be accompanying then since he was too well known and

his mission ras not important enough to justify the risk and the

expense involved.

7.

LIRINGS uid not depart as

he had hoped on 5 April 1968,

because Lara unfortunately accidentally shot himself in the ankle

on the norning of that day vile cleaning his gus and had to be .

given nedical attention before he could make the trip.

LIRING4

told RONTOY that LIRING3, Francisco Lara and Rail Sloreno, a

friend of LIRISG3, finally left lexico City in the personal

car of Paul Moreno

on 10 April 1958. but that Moreno had returned

to Mexico City two days later as a result of an accident that

disabled the car sorewhere in Chiapas.

LIRING& did not report

anything concerning the subsequent intolvement of Carlos Persaval

Marcue,

stating that she iad not received any cominication

fron

LIRING} after his telegran of 12 April, in which ke reported

the return of Raul Moreno. RONTO! surmises that wien Raul

Moreno tad to return to lexico City. LIRING3 a-d Lara asked

Carlos Persaval Marcue to join then and drive then to the border

1=113

sad that Porcaval continued on with then toward

Guatemila City.

advised on 22 April 1968,

that

the story of the arrest of Lara,

Persaral and LIZISG3 had reached

the local press and

that they would be turned over to the appro

priate courts for trial.

This indicates

that LiBisc3 may

eventualls be

released and bence be arailable to BONION for

complete debriefing.

The only significant nase that had surfaced as a result

of LIRIVG3's involserent with the Guatemalan resels in Mexico

City is that of Rolando Mendez Aguilar,

whom Frascisco Lara

Barrios contacted on 45-60-30 extension 27,

in carly April fron

the home telephone of LIRIXG3.

"Publicaciones

(This number corresponds to the

€ Impresiones Mexicaras, S.A. - Diario Ovaciores,

Calle Lago Sirabuen

297, Mexico City).

From the LIFEAT coverage •

on LIRING3 it is apparent that lencez is a close contact of

both Lara and Sandoval

and may be providing or tase provided

emplorment for them in

Hexico.

The Station is attempting to

determine the home address of

lendez in the hope that further

details of his possible collaboration may be uncorered.

surveillance by the LI EMBRACES.

The results, at least in the

PBRUV phase of this operation, have been unspectacular so

far.

The main usefulness of LIRING-3 and LIRISG 4 has been

a) as access agents to bikiib, (although this has been

largely reduced to the LIRING

Consulate), and b) to introduce

Wallace B. RONTOS to visiting PBRUNEN officials and members i

of tne local leitist community with access to PaRUlE and

LIRING.

and hopefully

recruit new sources of information.

The exploitation of

LIRISG-3's contacts with representatives of the Guatemalan

FAR rebel movenert was the object of separate correspondence.

LIRING 3's renewed contacts with these representatives do

not at this time involve PBRUSEN,

although the latter clearly

supports at least some of their activities.

Forwarded under separate cover are fifteen reports

important aspect of this operation during the period under

as the situation changed

and LIRING4 did not really know what to expect

from LIRING fron one meeting with its representatives to the

next, not to agzin mention the ups and downs of the LIRING 3/

LIRING4 relationship, which hit a new low during this period.

The Station

would like to point out in passing that, in

addition to

cable reporting and dispatches transnitting

contact reports, the operations in which LIRING-3

and LIRING 4 are

involved in are reviewed in sone detail in

the over-all mouthly report submitted by the PBRCie, Section

of this Station.

The last time LIRING4 accompanied LIRISG 3 to PBRUMEN,

she obtained an entry visa in a few days.

LIRISG4 thus felt

ex-enployee of LIRING with good connections in

she would obtain a new PBRUVEY entry visa

Extry visas are now quite a bit more difficult

to obtain, however,

for PPRUJEN nonofficial citizens abroad.

It also appears that the LIRING staff did not really know

what to make of LIRING-4's stated desire to return to PBRUMEN

for an extended period of time,

as this was obviously based

on a domestic quarrel.

LIRING3 and LIRING4 have had other

quarrels, and the LIRING staff may have thought that this last

one would subside and that LIRING 4 would postpone or cancel

her plans for going to PBRUMEN.

It was to convince the LIRING

staff that the difficulties with his wife were serious that

LIRING- 3. first went to LIRING. In a maneuver to further

the LIRING employees, particularly LIRING 2 and

LIRING 9, that LIRING 4 seriously wanted to go to PBRUMEN as

of donestic problems, ROWTON decided to have LIRING-3

openly question LIRING 4's right to take their child with

little scenario appears to have been well played. On the

This was indirectly confirmed

This channel may have been used because

at the same time obtaining good

Specifically, how did LIRING 3 hear of

the arrest of the LIRING member involved in a subversive case

in 1966, how did he learn of its proposed publication in the

press of a Central American country, how did he obtain the

report on Rico CLAN which he passed to LIRING, and how could

he have learned of certain of the activities of loises OROZCO

Leal?

To all these questions LIRIYG3 replied by saying that

he had good sources in lexico and Central America and that he

was not about to divulge them to the Bruitiers.

Both LIRING 2

and Identity in their conversations sith LIRING 3 and LIRING 4

took pains to say that LIRING3's conduct in his dealings

with LIRING and PBRUMEN was "above reproach." They wanted to

be sure, however,

"had not fallen victim to unscrupulous

elements constantly surrounding the revulution." To quote the

old cliche, LIRING3 "got their message."

5.

RONTON's introduction to LIRIYG2 and other LIRING

members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings

with LIRING2 were bound to make the latter sonewhat curious

about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of

"the revolution" who seems to travel extensively and appears

to have well-informed and influential friends in many parts

of the #orld.

LIRING-2 was apparently ruffled by ROWTON'S

criticism of

the LIRING efficiency

(see RONTON's report dated

1 January

sent as an attachment to reference B) since he

finally phoned ROWTON's

"office" after the incident described

in RONTON's 1 January report.

For some reason LIRISG 2 made

the call on a legal holiday when offices

are usually closed,

and the operator of ROWTOY's answering service answered

"Ar. ROWTON's (in alias) office."

This apparently made

LIRING 2 even more inquisitive.

ROWTOY that LIRING I would, if given a chance, prove herself

to be a good asset.

As for the question of being left with

continuing obligations in this operation, both LIRING 3 anc

LIRINC4 know that there is little ROWTOY could do beyond

providing legal-type advice to bring LIRING4 back to lexico

if the PBRUMENers refused to allow her to returu to ber husband,

an unlikely possibility as mertioned abore in view of current

Mexican/ PBRUMEN relations. The letter of understaing signed

by LIRIXG4 specifies the extent of ROWTON's commitment and

leaves no doubt as to the extent of his obligations.

Station hopes that LIRING 4's relationship with LIRIYG3 will

not improve with time to the point where she will lose the

proper motivation and cover to undertake the mission to PBRUMEN

for which she has been trained and briefed.

tinued that schenendia fizally con acted his by phone at about noon on

ments vas that ichemendía sas apologetic for the "Isunderstandiig" that

2. IIETiG/3 continued thatbe net with ?IniNC/2 on 25/2/68 at the latter"s

office with much more fuitful results. Accordin to 1/3, I2 began by

stating that "they" appreciated the information 1/3 bad passed to tien at

various times in -he past, specifically the repcrt of Julian Lopez' errest,

the proposed publication of the a:rest in the Guatesalan press, the report

concerning the letter of Rico Galán and the Crozco afrir, but they vere

rican contacts, as well as ¡exican sources in good positions, who could fur-

favorably with his explanation, sincs he linally stated that in reality

"they" (neaning airself, sergio tartinez, Iscail suarez de la Faz and

Cepeda), the Consejo ¿uperior de la Embajado" had nothing against sr. Harris

but simply that they did not inow enouga about nin. Il? then stated that

I/3 must realize that the revclution was surrounded by provocateurs and

that when they heve the least suspicions that they zust put on "tue amber

light" of caution. Il3 then stated that his dealings with sr. Harris were

sensitive higk-evel business negotiavions for the procurenent of sulpour

and that he could produce documints to prove tais. 1/2 replied thatthis

was not at all necessary and that it as sinolo just a question of inowing

a little zore about the sources available to 1/3 and abou: the "Greek". I/3

coniuded with a statement that i/2 must in the last analysis weigh the en

tire affair in terms of whether I/3 in fact bad ever done anyting ageinst

the revolution. I2 replied ithout besitation that everyone felt that If3

had always acted in good faith and h-d the best of intentiogs. It was simpl

that they felt that 1/3 nigot have becone a victin of a provocateur without

realizing it.

4. I/2 then stated that he had no objection to Eirise Il4 an entry prait

but he hoed that I3 was not just trying to solve a domestic problem by

sending her back to her mother. L/3 replied that there was in fact a serious

domestic problem and confessed th t be had had an affair with another woman .

which It had discovered but be felt tais as a very personal problem about

which Iy2 should not be concerned. I/2 replied that he agreed with this and

sas concerned simply about the child whidd he felt I/4 shourd be peruitted

to take with ber. I3 told Ronton that he finally conceded to Lf2 that per-

haps he was richt and that he should be nore considerate of'Irt and persit

her to tase the child to javana. Il3 told Forton that the seeting vith 1/2

LIRD:C/4 Report of Questioning by LIRIiG/2 re

Rowton

("The creek").

1. at 1030 on 17 Iebruary, 1963, iIKIIG/4 inforsed howton that she had

aropped into the Llait offices at about 1230 on 15 February and again

on the norning of the folloving day to check with IIRLiG/2 concerrine

her entry permit for travel to javana. Co the first occasion LIRI: G/2

asked her casually nether she had seen anything of the "greek friend"

lately. IInIiG/4 told orton that she replied that she and LIRING/3 heard

Iron his fron tine to time, rainly by telephone, and that he had invited

her out cocasionally, but she,lIRiG/4, bad turned hin down.

2. Ca tbo =ee0nd Greedier, Curáro the late MaminG Me AB Pohtlony 1069:

LIRN:G/2 sa L/4 again on the preises and asked to not to leave until

she lad seen him, since he wented to discuss sonethine with her. duen she

fibaliy sar him in his office some 30 -inutes later, he again asked whether

she had seen the "Greek", sot zentioring Rowton by his alias (Harris).

Since I/2 ned mentioned 1/4's Greek friend woon he had met through Fodolfo

Reyes on a previously occasion, llni:G/4 felt she could not preterd at to

know about whon be ras talking. Sne therefore repliea again that cocasional-

1y she beard fron kis when he was on a trip to lexico. MNING/2 asked

what 1j4 thought of bin (the Greek), to sick she replied that she

found

hin pleasant and ver? generous (bondacoso). I/2 replied,

"Yes, but what

does that generosity cone fron?" He thea added that he had many question-

marks concerning that person. He save as an exazple the lact that ben be

telephoned his nunter on a bolidey, 31 December or 1 caruary, his "secre-

tary" replied. It seened very strange, continued I/2, tbat

the Greek's

telephone was manned at all times, night and day, and even on holidays.

He then further expressed doubts about where this person lived and bow

he earned his money, and why be was so interested in Cuba.

3. LIRING/4 stated to Reston that she as st first quite taken aback by

this direct "interrogation", even thougb it was nace in a friendly tone,

and replied as best she could by ear. She stated that she assumed the

Greek was carryiLe On lucrative business and lived in jurope alóbouga she

could not supply any specific answers. She was aware that he had brought

sore of LIMIliG/3's paintings at an excellent price and took hisgenerosity

activity when ice occasion dalled fo= it. IIUl3/2 replied that be bad

too many otber things to do, and angray, when sc-ething smelled bad

("apesta") he leeps away fion it. 11211G/4, costinuing to tare tbe of-

fensive, states that on several occasions lathe jast the Greek had invited

her out but ske had not accepted, but that sce easily could accept on the

next occasion. ald possibly even obtain a photo of soue, kand for II I:G/2.

I/2 replied that a paoto would not be of any use, all he could do vita

it teing to send it to lavana. He aided that he had many suspicions,parti-

cularly as a result of the teleptone, but hac sothing concrete "i- his

bands", and that what ke needed as "datos".

4. LIxIliG/2 then asked I/4 whether she knew then dodolfo Reyes was return-

ing and where he would be living? she told sorton toat she relied in the

negative, commenting sinoly that sie had heard that he. rould be coving

to chile to work in the national ballet there. I/2 returning again to the

Greek sondered way he was so generous with gifts and entertainment. 1/4

stated that she never looked a gift corse in the south, to which unliG/?

replied that she must be careful, if not for ber oin sake at lease for the

sake of LIRIG/3 woo, be felt, was nor treading on firm ground( "terrero

firne). I/4 aditted that she was often worried about I/3's activities,

about wich be told ber alnost nothing. Il2 then commented "Invesitigate

the Greek and Jou'il feel better." (iverizua lo del Griego). He then added

that that supposed letter from rico Galán vas sot considered autestic,

and also the case of orozco definitely involved the police Il-ti, since

she was awar: that il3 had discussed both these cases with Iz, excest

that Il3 had not to ber knowledge centioned the arrest of Crozco, stated

that she felt If had acted in completely sood faith, even though ce might

have been somewhat irpalsive ("precipitado")

5. LIRING/2, continu Do the conversation, waich according to I/4 lasted

over one hour, stated that both she and I/3 rust be careful of their con-

tacts. ie conmented that he could not ever go out on a date with a firi

without thinking of the consequences. lie could go out once maybe, but

he felt it wiser to doop the contact for securit: reasonal 4 told joston

that she concluded the conversation with a promise to elicit as mich data

subject:

SaSala xanination of IIRIKG/3.

1. Pros about 1330 until 1530 on 29 September, 1957, LIRING/3 was

Elven an SS:IRl examination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse (Tacu-

baja) with the SGuIRi operator at 0930 that coming and remained vith

the operator until the exerination was completed. He had not civen LI-

RUiG/3 any previous notice of the nature or exteat of the examination,

but slaply asked his, on 2? September, to keep the entire day of 29 Septer-

ber Iree for a lecity dicussion with Bowton. Zorton introduced the 3G-

SIBI operator as señor albertini, a trusted "sccio", and spent the first

hour or so revierig his relationship with iInI:S/3, ostensibly for the

doubts that he had in the past concerning iIRt:3/3's reporting, stated

that Albertini had & neans of checkire scientifically the trutbfulness

Of LIBING/3's statesents. Routon explained that be was particularly con-

cerned about the possiblity of IIRI:S/3 having doubled back with iliG

andraintzining with them a secret agreement of some sort to report on

Rowton and his activities.

2. WRING/3 wiet into a state cf visible snock at this and stated that

even the thought of betraying Rowton had never occurred to him at any time.

when the SiS*Il operator explained the scienti?ic means he was to use on

LIBNiG/3, the latter stated that he could not passibly accept this humili-

ating means of testing hin since it was diarestrically opposed to his

principles. He pointed out that he had accepted sowton at his word and be

could t see or understand uby Rowton colld not do the same for his, adding:

that the whole thing snacked of nethods used by «OFAST and LIRIiG. He added

that if this neant that he would have to break with Bouton, then regret

fully he would have to accept this alternative. He explained that subnit-

ing to the SGS. IRe exanination would inevitably destroy the idealistic and

profound relationship which he had previously felt he enjoyed with Bowton.

3. Rorton and the SGS"IRl operator spent the next two hours calning LIRING/: •

dom and finally convincing him that he would not be conpromising with his

deeply-felt prisciples by taking the test. He at last consented to be ques

tioned on his lojalty to Rowton and insisted that he be asked, ""Do you be-

11eve In Kowton?"

4. Alter a brief break for lunch the exarination was given inone of the bed

roms «RE the apartient while Roston waited in the living room. LIaING/3

appeared to be in reasonably good spirits after the test, although

he was obvioisly enotionally strained by the experience. Rowton nade

a date to see him again that evening at 2100 tn talk things over in

a claner atrosphere.

5. hi that neeting with IICiC,3 Rowton explained that he had felt it

necessary to ascertain as oujectively as possibly the extent of LIRIlo/3°g

loyalty to him and he was happy to have scientifi: proof that LIRILC/3

had not berayed his to the IIRIlG's. LIPING/3 stated that after it vas

all over he felt setter and alaitted that he agreed with Rowton on the

necessity for such an examilation, buniliating as it night at first bare

==ao9pà tabe, do censorred that any "amero" lesbedentione and modeeten?

that he bad nade in the past, were due to his intense desire to produce

for Roston, since he still felt very sensitive about baving to accept soney

Iron Boston vithout being able to render commensurate services.: He stress-

ed, however, that at no time bad be ever been disloyal to Rowton or done

anything agairst sorton's interest, as señor Albertial could prove with

thi results of the SGS-IRL. LIRING/3 promised in the future to follow Row

ton's direction serupulously and assured Rowton that he no longer felt.

unde= any compuleion to erasgerate or fabricate anything to impress Borton.

6. Headquarters and the Station may find the SGIri examination disappohn

ting in 1ts limited coverage, but It ndust be realized that LIRING/3's..

initial reaction das entirely negative and at one point he treatened to.

break off completely with Roston because of the insult to his "dignity".

Although the StSitrI operator felt that from a professioral standpoint it

would be better to administer the exariration at another time when ITEING/3

was less enotionally upset, Rowton asked both him and LIRirG/3 to 50 thru

with it on the spot, feeling that psychologically it was essential to

nake LIFING/3 subit, even for a linited test. Rout:n also feels that the

test did serve as a very favorably deterrent over iIRIlG/3 in the future,

when & second one can be more painlessly administered, in a calmer atros-

phere. It, of course, also covered the very pertinent question of whether

LIRING/3 had been an LIRING doble agent or betrayed Routon in any way.

on a very discreet basis.

He said he hoped to put on another Cuban

show in Chile,

before returning to his ianily in Havana:

coverage of LIRISG-3's aparteent for 26 October showed, incident-

ally, that REYES maintains close enough relations with

DERAY (of Lee Harvey OSKALD fame) to be invited by ber to her

house for lunch.

CarEen MOLISA de CARRASCO is the leftist wife of al

prominent local neurosurgeon, Juan CARPASCO with whom she spent

some yea's in Cuba.

According to what

she previously told LIRING 3,

current lexican Minister of Interior) Carmen

LOZADA who is planning to divorce her husband, Enrique RAVIREZ, a

rabid pro-CASTRO Vexican chenical engineer who is still in Cuba.

Carmen LOZADA's father, Armenegildo LOZADA, a noted lexican

physician is narried to a pro-CASTRO Cuban.

According to informa-

tion made available to LIFTER-1, in early 1967 both be (Armenegildo)

LIFTER-1, is a personal friend of several Cuban leaders including

the CASTRO brothers.

Husband and wife naintain a close relation-

Carmen LOZADA apparently also started out as a hard line Jarxist.

Information dated 1961 from RYLABILE indicates that she 525 !

active in Communist organizational work at UNAl and participated

in Cuban led activities directed against ex-Peruvian President

Although she is still clearly a leftist, Carmen may not be

as red now.

She told RONTON, for example,

that she felt

nothing but disgust for her fanatically pro-CASTRO husband and

had strong resentment toward her step-nother.

Per LIESTOr, July

1961, Carmen was in contact with Teresa PROEYZA when the latter

was at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

At a private lunch with Carmen HOLINA, 28 Cctober,

BOTTON explained

that he was a Greek leftist (although not a

He said

that because of the current situation in Greece,

it was difficult

for him to operate in Vexico as openly as he would like.

JOLISA's help in obtaining certain

types of

information and making discreet contacts with Vexican government

and business circles. NOLINA agreed to do what she could.

She

stated that she was

not a nember of any lexican or any other

Communist organization, but merely a leftist sympathizer. She

also stated that she currently maintains little or no contact with

the Cuban Embassy.

Subject:

Report of LIKING/3 Suspect iffiliatior with wozIaM.

2. LIZING/3 reported to sexton at 0900 on 30 Cote: ar, 1967, that be

bad finally nanged to have a private talk with Rocolfo! Reyes Sortes,

his Mexicar chereographer friend, ou the afternoon of 27 October, 1967;

and that, in the course of conversation, Rodolfo eyes had revealed

to IIRIlG/3 in confidence that the reason why the IIRiNGS had assumed

a rather cocl attitude toward LIKING 3 over the past year.

Zodolfo

Reyes explaized that the last time he was in savana he lad heard rumors,

arong bis friencs in the l'exican colony, that LIRI:G/3 was working

"either for mURIaM or the Cubans". Rodollo went os to say that the

origin o1 tois rumor, as iar as he could ascortain, was the fact that

LIRING/3 had pade two trips into Havana for no know specificreason and

at his own espense. Rodolfo Reyes, indicating that de himself did not

believe the runors or, at least, did not care whether they were true or

not, commented to LIRING/3 that other menbers of IIPING/3's profession

were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of their group and were

always quict to draw their own couclusions.

2. LIRING/3 co-mented to Rowton that, although this news had shaken hi

and LIRING/4 badly at the time, neither of them cared particularly wast

the LIRIliGs thought of them, since their own conscience ves cleer.. II-

RIRG/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop bis

commercial activity in Chiapas ( especially since acdolfo Reyes' home is

by coinciderce

Located in San Cristobal) so that iord would gradually.

filter back to the WIllits that he actually did bave financial resources

outside his art production. LIRING/3 continued that obviously the unties

did not have any specific proof or they would long ago have cut off all

contact with him as well as LIRING/4. He concluded that since the LIBLiGS

had certain suspicions, they naturally warned all dis friends and forzer

"contacts (lacluding, of course, arnol Rodriquez)

to avoid close contact

with him until their doubts could be resolved.

3. In reply to howton's query LIRING/3 stated that Zodolfo Rejes and Carmen

Molina (separately) had commented to him that they vere favorably inpresseu

by Rowton ard did not voice any suspicion of ñowton's bona fides (as a

Greek leftist businesswan)• Carnen Molina, in fact, had gone so far as to

shor some irritation that LIRING/3 had not introduced her to kowton pre-

vously since she was anxious to develop sone sort of lucrative business

sure she could help horton in his business ad political problens ani

at the same time make a little auch-needed money for her own living

expenses.

4. LIRIIC/3 continued that he had been maintaining siscreet personal

contact with Carnen Lozada over the week-end ( be commented that iIRlNG/4

has already shown sone signs of jealousy and there¿ore head to be careful

not to give ber-cause to distrust him). IIiII3/3 stated-that-Jarnen I0--

zada had told hin that her father, a well-to-do Mexican doctor residing

In Coyacan, had remarried tand that her step-nother vas a Cuban sicentist

mei wond iived wany gear:: In Mexico. She added that both her father and

step-astber were on excellent social terms with Ambassador Herrández Armas.

She revealed that she nad already notified ber husband, aarique Ranirez,

+I-t she intended to divorce him, and she expected a storn of protest bota

fros bin ( in Havana) and her father and step-nother, both of whos vere

"puritanic" despite their "progressive" convictions. She added that she

expected Enrique Ranirez to rush over from Havana as soon as he received

her letter and to appeal to her father and step-other to save his nar

riage. She, however, insisted to IIRITG/3 that she had sade up her mibd

that she would so tarough with the divorce. She added that for this reason

3ae did not wish to live with her father and had decided to stay with:

her friend, Carmen Molina, until the divopce papers here through and the

store had blow over. She added that she did not particularly like being

a house-guest in the small aprtment of Carnen roline, but at the moment

she had no choice.
