3. Yhe product of LIZIXG-4's efforts to case the
LIRING consulate will be reviewed in a separate dispatch H
which will also transmit floor plans and dravicgs of that
LIRING component. There is little question that the-1eus
of LIRING-3's arrest in Guatemala gained LIRING-4 the syn=
pathy of various menbers of LIRING including LIRING-3, -9
and -16, They seen to understand LIRING-4‘s desire to postpo:
her departure for PBRUMEN after having received her long awaited
PBRUMEN vi The problem now is to have LIEING-4 leave for |
PBRUKEN while LIRING-3 is still incarcerated in Guatemala. As
mentioned in a recent cable, ROXTOM has encouraged LIRING=4's,
plans to try to visit LIRISG-3 in jail in Guatemala City as ©
ROWTON feels that LIRING-3 will probably urge LIRING-4 to
spend in PBRUMEN at least soze of the time he has to spend in
jail, As for the conduct of Sergio VALDEZ (see ROWION's reports
dated 19 April and 6 May), it appears that the latter has delib-

of LIRING-3 to test ber reactions. It is doubtful that he acted

indication that he may have been doing this for the PBRUMEN's
(although this is no doubt a possibility). The Station is look=
ing into the desirability, at this point, of placing VALDEZ

under surveiilance. The claim that ROWION in alias offered
Carmen LOZADA « certain sum oi money for intelligence information
in PERUMEN bas no foundation.

developments leading to the trip made by LIRING-3’ to Guatemala in
the company of FAR menber, Francisco Alalberto #LARA Barrios,
and Carlos Manuel “PERSAVAL Marcue, Mexican national and nephew
of Manuel Marcue Pardinas, eyedirecter af tho nom a
Politica. This trip, as the has advised,
Tesulted in the arrest of all three persons in Guatemala just

CONTINUATION OF i i 1 i
DISPATCH i BECKET? — HMMA - 34531!

2, According to reports subnitted to Wallace B, ROCTON [by
LIRING-3, the latter set Carlos Manuel Persaval Varcue origiqally
through the latter's sister-in-lav, Carmer‘Lozada de Ramirez,
who had been carrying on an extra-marital affair with LIRING-3
since early November 1327, On the evening of 3 March 1968, *

Persaval approached LIRING-3 in connection with the fas havidg

that a young Guatemalan voman living in Mexico City vas havi
in ovtaining false docusentation to enable her to travel to |
Guatemala to recontact her husband, whom Persaval described as
“an important guerrilla leader”. Persaval revealed to LIRING-3
that he had been assisting the FAR in propaganda work in Wexico
for some time and gave LIRING-3 several copies of a pasphlet |
eatitl:d "Violencia en Guatemala" which Persaval said had been
published cn one of his uncle's presses and was being sold at the
nominal price of three Mexican pesos to help raise money for ithe
FAR, '

! '

3. When LIRING-3. under ROWION's direction, respoaded
favorably to this initial approo~4, Persaval pursued the matter
and finally, on § April, reveal. that he vas in touch with two
ie lcade.e” uu ntecucu oeap an returning ¢
clandestinely to Guatenala. Persaval asked LIRING-3 to arrange
to guide these persons across the Guatemalan border south of
Chiapas, an area LIRING-3 had previously told Persaval ke was very
faniliar with from his previous residence in San Cristobal.
Persaval made no further reference to the "young Guatemalan wife
of the PAR leader”, LIRING-3 surmised to ROWION that this person
might actually have been the wife of Francisco Lara Barrios, but
that plans for her return were discarded in favor of the trip
by Lara himself.

4. At ROWTON's urging, LIRING-3 insisted on meeting the tvo
Guatenzlans involved and in talking to them before undertaking
such a mission. Persaval finally introduced LIRING-3 to Francisco’
Lara Barrios on 17 March 1968, and the latter presented LIRING-2
to a certain "Rodolfo", who LIRING-3 ascertained subsequently wes
a member of the 13th of November group headed by Yon Sosa by the
nane ofySandoval. Francisco Lara Barrios confided to LIRING-3
that he had in his possession a false Guatemalan passport in the
name of Jose Maria‘Oliva Carranza and that he had obtained legal
residence in Mexico with his wife and children through the efforts
of ex-Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas. He also named a certain

yEskenazi and LIREBEL-1 as persons who assisted Guatemalaa exiles
in Mexico. Station believes Eskenazi may be identical vith
Luis DavidsEskenassy Cruz, a former agent

5. With the approval of ROWTON, LIRING-3 agreed to! help
the above-mentioned persons to cross the Mexican/Guatemalan border
and te accompany them to Guatemala City. This latter extension of
the original trip was made by Lara at the suggestion of LIRING-3
so that the latter could meet with the FAR woman responsible for
logistics, LIRING-3 reported to ROVTON subvequently that just
before their departure, Lara also offered to arrange for LIRING-3
to travel clandestinely to the Sierra de las Minas to meet directly
with FAR and 13th of November leaders to discuss further| support
that LIRING-3 might be able to provide through | his co jal
contacts in Chiapas and northern Nexico.

<6, “LIRING-3 fabricated a false Mexican identity d nt
(Secretaria-“de Education) for Francisco Lara Barrios in the |
name of. Jacinta‘Rangel Cervantes with Lara slightly disguised so
that tke latter could move about more unobtrusively on the Mexican

just prior to their scheduled departure date, Francisco Lara

informed LIRING-3 that their mutual friend Rodolfo Sandoval
would not be accompanying them since ke was too vell known and
his mission was not important enough to justify the risk and the
expense involved.

7. LIRING-3 did not depart as he had hoped on 5 April 1968,
because Lara unfortunately accidentally shot himself in the ankle
on the morning of that day wnile cleaning his gu and had to be
given medical attention before he could make the trip. LIRING-4
told ROWION that LIRING-3, Francisco Lara and Raul/Moreno, a
friend of LIRING-3. finally left Mexico City in personal
car of Raul Moreno on 10 April 1958. but that Moreso had returned
to Mexico City two days later as a result of an-accident that
disabled the car sorewhere in Chiapas. LIRING-4 did not report
anything concernirg the subsequent involvement of Carlos Persaval
Marcue, stating that she tad not received any ccmnuunicatioa from
LIRING-3 after his telegram of 12 April, in whick te reported
the return of Raul Moreno. 20¥TON surmises that wren Raul
Moreno Lad to return to Mexico City. LIRING-3 lara asked
Carlos Persaval Marcue to join then and drive trex to the border
f2 hit oa cor, and thet Persaval continued on wita them toward
Guatemala City.

8. advised on 22 April 1968, that
the story of the arrest of Lara, Persaval and LI2ING-3 had reached
the local press and that they would 5e turned over to the appro-
priate courts for trial. This indicates that LIRING-3 may
eventually be released and hence be available to ROWION for '
complete debriefing.

9, The only significant name that had surfaced as a result
of LIRING-3's involvement with the Guatemalan rezels in Mexico
City is that of Rolando”’Mendez Aguilar, whom Francisco Lara
Barrios contacted on 45-60-30 extension 27, in early April from
the home telephone of LIRING-3. (Tzis number corresponds to the
"Publicaciones e Impresiones Mexicaras. S.A. - Dizrio Ovaciozes,
Calle Lago Sirahuen 297, Mexico City). From the LIFEAT coverage
on LIRING-3 it is apparent that Nencez is a close coatact of
both Lara and Sandoval and may be providing or tave provided
employsent for them in Wexico. The Station is attempting to
determine the home address of Mendez in the hope that further
details of his possible collaboration may be uncovered.

MEVORANDUM |
SUBJECT: LIRING-3 Visit To Guatemala With Guerrillas | t

FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARRA BARRIOS and CARLOS’ | iH
MANUEL PERSAVAL MARCUE

1, On 5 March 1968, LIRING-3 had dinner with CARLOS i
PERSAVAL MARCUE, nephew of MANUEL MARCUE PAROINES, director
of the now defunct magazine "POLITICA", a Cozmunist bi-
monthly publication, During the dinner PE2SAVAL queried
LIRING-3 if he could obtain a false passport for the wife
of an important Guatemalan guerilla leader so that she:
CouLS tiesel Ieum Mealy bu Ulanen-1a, Lininu-3 replied
that he wculd do his utmost to assist.

2, On 8 March 1968 PERSAVAL told LIRING-3 that two(2)
Guatemalan revolutionaries had need to travel to Guatemala

by mid-March. LIRING-3 commented that there was limited
possibility of obtainirg false documents, but that he could.
brief the Guatemalans so as to facilitaté their illegal
crossing of the Mexican/Guatemalan border, or if they desired,
he would guide them.

i
3. On 9 March 1968, PERSAVAL again discussed the matter

-with LIRING-3, saying that one of the two travellers possessed

- legal travel docuzents. Since the other person has no such ‘

legal documents, they should enter Guatemala illegally,

{ MEXI-4790 7

4, LIRING-3 reported on 27 Yarch 1968, that one of the
traveller to Guatemala is FRANCISCO ADALBERTO LARA BARRIOS.
The group is of the opinion that LIRING-3 should also go to
Guatemala in order to seet an unidentified woman, described
as the FAR logistics officer, to discuss FAR support from
Mexico.
/-MEXI-500077 {

5. Departure was delayed because LARA sustained a self-
inflicted gun shot wound while cleaning a weapon. On 10 April
LIRING-3, LARA, and another person--described as a member of
the YON SOSA Faction--departed en route to Guatemala. {
LIRING-3 was informed that the FAR and the YON SOSA group .
are now working together, but that a certain amount of
compartmentation exists.

Soperations Against PBRUMEN

ACTOR REGED « ERENCES and Their Contacts - January to 31 March 1968

‘
1. The development, handling, and exploitation of any
asset under false pretenses by someone operating under false
fas tee mo ieawhaawe Tm that
case of LIRI a/Lia G-4 the situation is further complicated
by the fact that PBRUMEN nationals at hone and in LIRING (the
main target against whom the two have been directed) have -
long suspected their motives for maintaining contact and
wanting to cooperate with thea. The ups and dowus of the
LIRING-3/LIRING-4 marital relations have from time to tine
further complicated the conduct of operations involving them.
The Station can understand that Headquarters has some reser-
vations on the conduct of these operations. They have beea
cczplicated, time consuming, and have blown hot and cold
depending on the state of mind of the PBRUMENers at the time
and the difficulties between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. Because
of incomplete control, an almost inescapable feature of this
type of operation, a considerable effort was made to check
the reliability of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4. This involved ,
LIFEAT coverage, audio monitoring (LIROSIN), and occasional

surveillance by the LIEMBRACEs. The results, at least in the

PBRUMEN phase of this operation, have been unspectacular so

far. The main usefulness of LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 has been:

a) as access agents to LIRING, (although this has been |

largely reduced to the LIRING Consulate), and b) to introduce

Wallace B. ROWTON to visiting PBRUMEN officials and members|

of the local leftist community with access to PBRUMEN and j

LIRING. A major effort was started recently to take this

operation up one more notch and, taking advantage of a recent

crisis in the relations between LIRING-3 and LIRING-4, send

the jatter to PBRUMEN on a mission to assess and hopefully ;

recruit new sources of information. The exploitation of 7 :

LIRING-3's coutacts with representatives of the Guatemalan E

FAR rebel moverent was the object of separate correspondence.

LIRING-3's renewed contacts with these representatives do

hot at this time involve PBRUMEN, although the latter clearly :

supports at least some of their activities. : :

2. Yorwarded under separate cover are fifteen reports
prepared by Wallace B, RO#TCN on the activities of LIRING-3,
TNOed. and come nf their contacts from late January to
31 March 1968. The Station has noted Headquar‘:ers' desire
for more frequent progress reports per reference A. It felt,
however, that in this case partial reporting of LIRING-4's
difficulties in obtaining a PBRUMEN visa (by far the most
important aspect of this: operation during the period under a
review) could have been misleading, as the situation changed
several times and LIRING-4 did not really know what to expect
from LIRING from one meeting with its representatives to the
ueaxt, not to again mention the ups and downs of the LIRING-3/
LIRING-4 relationship, which hit a new low during this period.
The Station would like to point out in passing that, in
: addition ¢o cable reporting and dispatches transmitting:
: RO¥TON's contact reports, the operations in which LIRING-3
i and LIRING-4 are involved in are reviewed in sone detail in w a
the over~ail monthly report submitted by the PBRUMEN Section
: of this Station. .
3. The last time LIRING-4 accompanied LIRING-3 to PBRUMEN,
she obtained an entry visa in a few days. LIRING-4 thus felt
that as an ex-enployee of LIRING with good connections in
PBRUMEN and LIRING she would obtain a new PBRUWEN entry! visa
fairly easily. Entry visas are now quite a bit more difficult
to obtain, hawever, for PRRUMEN nonofficial citizens abroad.
It also appears that the LIRING staff did not really know
what to make of LIRING-4's stated desire to return to PBRUMEN
: for an extended period of time, as this was obviously based
: ‘on a domestic quarrel. LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 have had other
eee quarrels, and the LIRING staff may have thought that this last are
one would subside and that LIRING-4 would postpone or cancel.
her plans for going to PBRUMEN. It was to convince the LIRING "
staff that the difficulties with his wife were serious ‘that.
LIRING-3.first went to LIRING. In a maneuver to further
convince the LIRING employees, particularly LIRING~2 and
LIRING-9, that LIRING-4 seriously wanted to go to PBRUMEN as
a@ result of domestic problems, ROWTON decided to have LIRING-3
openly question LIRING-4's right to take their child with
i her. it must be remembered that, in “exico, «a wife cannot
leave the country, and especially take a child with het,
without the express and official consent of the husband. This
little scenario appears to have been well played. On ie
other hand, it did not help LIRING-4 obtain a visa any /faster.
LIRING-2 appeared to be waiting, among other things, for
LIRING-3 to arrive at a decision regarding their child jaccept-
able to his’ wife. LIRING-3 finally "agreed" to let LIRING-4 :
i take the child at his 26 February meeting at LIRING. Two
2 days before, LIRING-4 had been told by LIRING-2 that bead

se eursous common, SECRET



CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH SECRET HMBIA - 34484

“consejo superior" of LIRING, of which he said he was a member,
had not yet taken up her case. This was indirectly confirmed
by LIRING-16, who told LIRING-4 the same day that nothing
about her visg case had yet been sent to PBRUNEN as he would
otkeiviss kuot it, isco he hendled 211 vis+ correspondence.

4. There is naturally the possibility that LIRING-4's
visa request was handled by LIRING via classified correspondence
not seen by LIRING-16. This channel may have been used because
LIRING-4's visa request brought out the old problem of
LIRING-3's reliability in the eyes of the PBRIMENers. Although
LIRING-2, LIRING-9, and Identity appeared sympathetic toward
LIKiNG-4 and her projected visit to PBRUMEN (to the point
where they advised her on more than one occasion not to come
back to Mexico), they, at the same tire, sought to clarify
two things. They first made another attempt to throw some
light on the sources through which LIRING-3 had obtained
information of particular interest to LIRING. Secondly they
brought up the question of "the Greek” (ROWTON) and tried to
obtain answers to pertinent questions. LIRING, as mentioned
by poth LIKLAG-2 aod luentacy, is nee used wo being Bivou
sensitive information without at the same time obtaining good
source description. Specifically, how did LIRING-3 hear of
the arrest of the LIRING member involved in a subversive case
4n 1966, how did he learn of its proposed publication in the
press of a Central American country, how did he obtain the -
report on Rico GALAN which he passed to LIRING, and how could
he have learned of certain of the activities of Moises OROZCO
Leal? To all these questions LIRING-3 replied by saying that
he had good sources in Mexico America and that he
was not about to divulge tnem to the MENers. Both LIRING-2
and Identity in their conversations with LIRING-3 and LIRING-4
took pains to say that LIRING-3's conduct in his dealings
with LIRING and PBRUMEN was "above reproach.” They wanted to _~
be sure, however, that he dq not fallen victim to unscrupulous
elements constantly surrounding the revoiution.” To quote the
old cliche, LIRING-3 "got their message."

5. ROWTON’s introduction to LIRING-2 and other LIRING
members by Rodolfo REYES Cortes and his subsequent meetings
‘with LIRING-2 were bound to make the latter sonewhat curious
about this wealthy Greek businessman and proclaimed friend of
“the revolution” who seems to travel extensively and appears
to have well-informed and influential friends in many parts
of the world. LIRING-2 was apparently ruffled by ROWTON's
criticism of the LIRING efficiency (see ROWTON's report dated
1 January sent as an attachment to reference B) since he

_ finally phoned ROWTON's "office" after the incident described
in ROWTON's 1 January report. For some reason LIRING-2 made
the call on a legal holiday when offices are usually closed,
and the operator of ROWTON's answering service answered
"Mr. ROWTON's (in alias) office." This apparently made : 5
LIRING-2 even more inquisitive. During a one hour meeting
at LIRING on 15 February LIRING-2 asked LIRING-4 about her
relationship with "the Greek." LIRING-2 wanted to know where
and for whom he worked, et cetera. ROWTON's report of
17 February covers this conversation in detail. LIRING-2
appeared to suspect ROWTON may have been one of the sources
of the information passed LIRING by LIRING-3 and warned
LIRING-4 "to go easy with the Greek," if not for herisake, at
least for LIRING-3, who "has not always treaded on firm ground."
LIRING-4 provided some "information" on her Greek acquaintance
on 24 February. ROWTON, who had briefed her in detail on what

6. The Station does not know at this point whether

HANAFI would probably be unable to obtain a Mexican entry visa.

_Aecording to 1/4, 1/2 snatched up the natch-box with expressicns of appre-

ureek explained to her the difficulties and complexities of working with ‘
the Mexicans in procuring sulphur and sther critical sroducys, but she
confessed to 1/2 that she cnew nothin= about’ such matters end ‘felt very
confuded. She commented, however, thet the Greek sppeared quite relaxed and
willing to ansver her questicns. She acded that shen she turned the conver—

Action Required: Bone
Reference: HMMA-31821, dtd 3 April 1967.

1. Om 15 April 1968, circa 1410 hours, the audio installation
described in reference was deactivated. The SPT-2A was recovered
by Walter ®. CORNEURY and returned to Station stock. The UP equip~
ment, am SPR-2A and UHER 4000 L, will also be returned to Station
stock.

2. ‘Inasmuch ag LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 vere torninating their
“lense” on the target apartment, it was felt the SPT-2A carrier
current transmitter would have to be removed because of its shallow
concealment. To continue the assessment of target personalities,
however, we wanted to wait until almost the last minute. ‘The week
of 15 April 1963 was selected as an appropriate time by Waliace ad
ROTTON, who is in contact with the targets.

3. At about 1300 hours, 15 April 1968, Walter ¥. CORKBURY and
Gliver Db. Cim0CH entered the and were grevied by LISCSis who knew
we vere coming but did not know why. A check of the audio device
revealed that LIRING-4 and a young (teen-age) male relative were in
the target. This was as expected. At 1330 hours, LIRING-4 left.
the apartment, alone, for a luncheon date with ROWTOH. She returned
a@ few minutes later and made the male relative accompany ber. (This
wes obviously at tae insistence of 20¥TON.) The telephone number of
the target apartzent was tried a few minutes after their departure
and was pot answered, again as expected. At 1400 hours a telephone
call was received in the LP from the Station as a relay frem ROWTON
that the targets were safely ensconsed for at least the next hour.
(it was known that LIRING-3 was out of the city.) Another ‘telephone
eall to target with no answer, and CORNBURY entered the target

&. LIRING-3: Frou recent activity it snpears

that the Guatemalan FAR may have rereved its interest

in LIRING-3. In late January, an emissary of YAR

Yepresentatives in the PERUuEN capiial traveled to '

j Mexico and contacted the person who had carried to
PRRUMEN the letter sent by LIRING-3 in the summer
of 1967 denouncing Woises CROZCO Leal. The emissary -
brought the word that the FAR had much appreciated :
LIRIZG-3's letter os OROZCO and Warned that the FAR a
organization in Mexico City was infiltrated by a
YOFIRM operator. Try as he might, however, LIRING-3
failed, at least by the end of this peried, te
meet with the FAR man.

Subject: SGSsIZ% Sxanination of LIRTHG/3. a

1. From about 1330 until 1530 on 29 September ,19¢7, LIRING/3 was

given an SGS#IRL exanination. Rowton arrived at the safehouse ( Tacu-
baya) with the SGSeIRL operator at 0930 that =crning and remained with
the operator until the exezination was completed. fle had not given LI-
RING/3 any previous notice of the nature or extent of the examinaticn,
but simply asked hin,on 27 September, to keep the entire day of 29 Septen-
ber free for a lezzthy dicussicn with Zowton. Zewton introduced the SG-
SdIRL operator as seiior Albertini, a trusted "sccio", and spent tae first
bere or so ee his relationship sith iLIzIG/3, ostensibly for the
the anhjent of certain
doubts that he hab in the oer concerning iIR72/3's reporting, stated
that Albertini had 2 means of checking scientiséfically the truthfulness
of LIRING/3's statements. Kowton explained tt.st he was particularly con-
cernéd about the possiblity of LIRING/3 having doubled back with LizZIiG
andnaintaining with them a secret agreement of soae sort to report on
Rowton and his activities.

2. LIRIKG/3 wiet into a state cf visible shock at this and stated that
even the thought ef betraying Rowtcn had never cecurred to him at any time.
When the SG3sIZL eperator explained the scientific means he was to use on
LIgwiS/3, the latter stated that he could not pessibly accept this humili-
ating means of testing him since it was diazentrically opposed to his
principles. He pointed out that he had accepted Sowton at his word and he
could wt see or uccerstand why Rowton could not do the same for hin, adding .
that the whole thing smacked of nethods used Sy «OFACT and LIRING. He added
that if this meant that he would have to break with Rowton, then regret-
fully he would have to accept this alternative. de explained that submit-
ing to the SGS*#IRL examination would inevitably destroy the idealistic and
profound relationship which be had previously felt he enjoyed with Rowton.

3. Rowton and the SGS«IRL operator spent the next two hours calming LIRING/? -
down and finally convincing him ‘that he would not be compromising with his
deeply-felt pricciples by taking the test. He at last consented to be ques—
tioned on bis loralty to Rowton and insisted thet he be asked,"8Do you be-

lieve in Kowton?® 7 i : i

2. ;

t
appeared to be in reasonably good spirits after the test, although
he was obviously emotionally strained by the experience. Rowton nade
a date to see him acain that evening at 21CO0 to talk things over in
a claner atmosphere. 7 ;

5. At that meeting with LIRIH¢/3 Rowton explained that he had felt it
necessary to ascertain as ovjectively as pcssiblp the extent of LIZI‘G/3's
loyalty to him and he was happy to have scientific proof that LIRING/3

bad not berayed ain to the ZIRING's. LIXTiG/3 stated that after it was
all over he felt Vetter and adnitted that he agreed with Rowton on the _
necessity for such an examination, huniliating as it might at first have
orremmed te he, Fe confecesd that onm Vermore! Ceabeioctione ona nemteetona
that he bad made in the past, were due to his intense desire to produce
for Rowton, since he still felt very sensitive about having to accept soney
from Zowton without being able to render commensurste services.’ He stress—
ed, however, that at no time had he ever been disloyal to Rowton or done
anything against Howton's interest, as sefior Albertini could prove with

the results of the SGSWIRL. LIRIIG/3 promised in the future to follow Row-
ton's direction serupulously and assured Kowton that he no longer feit
unde> any compulsion to exaggerate or fabricate anything to impress Rowton.

6. Headquarters and the Station may find the SGSWIRL examination disapyoan-
ting in its limited coverage, but it miust be realized that LIRING/3's,
initial reaction sas entirely negative end at one point he theatenea to
break off completely with Rowton because of the “insult to his "dignity”.
Although the SGS¥IRL operator felt that from a professional standpoint it
would be better to administer the exazination at another time when LIZiNG/3
was less emotionally upset, Xowton asked both him and LIRiiG/3 to go thru;
with it on the spot, fedling that psychologically it was' essential to
make LIZING/3 subz=it, even for a limited test. Rowt:n also feels that the i

. test did serve as a very favorably deterrent over LIRING/3 in the future,

when a second one can be more painlessly adainistered, in a calmer atmos=
phere. It, of course, also covered the very pertinent question of whether
LIRING/3 bad been an LIRING do.ble agent or betrayed Rowton in any way.

2. Please note that the SGS¥IEL interviewer has made the
point that the principal misfortune in this’ interview probably i :
waa that LIEING/3 was not tested on the fabrication of contacts
with the IDEM D's, which was thought to be the most ciemee
area of deception.

3. In view of LIRIEG/3's threat to quit working for
ROWTON, we vould be interested in hearing of any repurcussions
or change in attitude that may have resulted from LIRING/3's
having taken the test. We also are interested in the Station's
comments and recommendations as to the continued use of LIRING-3,
bearing in mind ROWTON's recent report of LiKANG susp2caons :taat

LIRING-4 to a party giveu by Carnen MOLINA on 27 October, passing
himself as a wealthy Greek client of LIRING-3 who had called at
the latter's house to pay for a painting he had ordered but had
been invited by LIRING-4 to come to the party. As previously agree:
with the Station, ROWTON directed his main attention to REYES.”
The latter has resided in Havana since 1960 when he founded the
Cuban Ballet Folklorico. Until recently REYES has received the
monthly salary of one thousand pesos from the Cuban government,
and, according to LIRING-3 is well acquainted with political and
government personalities in Cuba. As pointed out in Reference,
ROWTON found REYES to be apolitical, a superficial sympathizer of
- the Cuban revolution and a great admirer of American choreography
(he told ROWTON he would very much like to go to New York to see
some of the shows there.) REYES complained about the relatively
low salary he is currently receiving from the Wexico City Belles
Artes for organizing a Cuban Ballet Folklorico show to be held
in Mexico City next December. He readily agreed to ROWTON's offer

on a very discreet basis. He said he hoped to put on anothey Cuban
stow in Chile, before returning to his family in Havana: LIFEAT
coverage of LIRING-3's apartment for 26 October showed, .incident-
ally, that REYES maintains close enough relations with Silvia
DCRAN (of Lee Harvey OSWALD fame) to be invited by her to hey
house for lunch. i i

2. Carmen MOLINA de CARRASCO is the leftist wife/of a
prominént local neurosurgeon, Juan CARPASCO with whom she spent
some yeas in Cuba. Eoth are Mexican citizens. According t¢ what
she previously told LIRING-3, Carmen MOLINA helped gather some of
the information used to defend both Victor RICO-Galan and the
ROSENBERGS. With the help of Alicia ECHEVERRIA and the! latter's
uscle (who is the current Mexican Minister of Interior) Carmen
obtained a prominent position on the Mexican Olympic Committee
in the publication department. She is a close friend of Carmen
LOZADA who is planning to divorce her husband, Enrique RAMIREZ, a
rabid pro-CASTRO Mexican chemical engineer who is still in Cuba.
Carmen LOZADA's father, Armenegildo LOZADA, a noted Mexican |
Physician is married to a pro-CASTRO Cuban. According to informa-
tion made available to LIFTER-1, in early 1967 both he (Armenegildo
and his second and present wife are hard core Marxists./ This
wile, ura mavla viciwila ue la Cala, a Cuban, oiill accu: Siete
LIFTER-1, is a personal friend of several Cuban leaders including
the CASTRO brothers. Husband and wife maintain a close relation-
ship with the local Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ-Arnas .
Carmen LOZADA apparently also started out as a hard line Narxist.
Information dated 1961 from RNLABILE indicates that she was |
active in Comzunist organizational work at UNAM aad participated
in Cuban led activities directed against ex-Peruvian President
PRADO. Although ske is still clearly a leftist, Carmen may not be
quite as red now. She told ROWION, for example, that she felt
nothing but disgust for ner fanatically pro-CASTRO husband ond
had strong resentment toward her step-mother. Per LIENVOY, July
1961, Carmen was in contact with Teresa PROENZA when the latter

was at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. H oa

3. At a private lunch with Carmen HOLINA, 28 Cctober,
ROWTON explained that he was a Greek leftist (although not a KKE
nember) involved in lucrative international business. He said
that because of the current situation in Greece, it was difficult
for him to operate in Wexico as openly as he would like. He
could thus use MOLINA's help in obtaining certain types of
information and making discreet contacts with Mexican government
and business circles. MOLINA agreed to do what she could. She
stated that she was not a member of any Mexican or any jother:
Communist organization, but merely a leftist sympathizer. She
also stated that she currently maintains little or no contact with
the Cuban Embassy. LIONION-1, to whom a photograph of, MOLINA,
REYES and LOZADA (copy of which is forwarded attached)jwas shown
stated he had never seen these three persons enter the) Cuban

4. Following the developments described above, pisses

per Reference, he may be recruited by ROWTON either under
false flag as a Greek leftist or in alias as a WOPIRM {|

b. To continue social developsent of MOLINA as

to live together) and a possible entree to tke Mexican:

Olympic Committee and foreign olympic delegation.

&. To attempt operational developuent of Carmen
LOZADA directly via ROWION or indirectly via LIRING-3 in
the hope that we can play on her "disgust" for the
fanaticism of her husband and her dislike of her mother-
in-law to elicit information on the activities of the
Cuban Embassy in Mexico City and its personnel, and,
hopefully to attempt her recruitnent.

5. Station would welcone addressees" comments on the
above. Headquarters attention is attracted to KOWION's report
of 30 October which quotes REYES" staterents to the effect that
soze members of the Mexican colony in Havana believe that
LIRING-3 may be working for WOFIRM (or for the CASTRO government.)

to convince all sresent that he actually was not from WCLADY (althcuzh

out a few phrases of itussian at the right time in the direction of Carmen
Kolina to impress her ( fortunatély her Russian is weaker even than Eouton'")
Kowton spoke some inglish with as good an accent as he could manaze. Carmen
Molina volunteered to hin privately that she had a great many “progressive”
friends in the U.S. Rowton was able to insert severzl] comments about the
current political situation in Greece that was forcing him|into a virtsally
clandestine exiestence in Mexico, as well as elsewhere. Evel one appeared
to sympathize with dowtcn and ceased asking any personal questions.

Subject: Report of LIKING/3 Suspect affiliaticn with WO7IaM.

1. LIRING/2 reported to “owton at C900 on 30 fi esaner that he

had finally zenged to have a private talk with Rodolfo! Reyes Cortes,

his Mexican chereograpoer friend, ou the afternoon of 27 Cctober,1967; .
and that, ir the course of conversation, xodolfo Reyes’ had revealed

to LIKING/3 in confidence tiat the reason why the LIZiNGS had assumed
a rather cool attitude toward LIXING/3 over the pest year. 2odolfo
Reyes explaized that the last time he was in 4avana he md heard rumors,
among his friends in the Mexican colony, that LIXIiG/3 was working
“either for «(¥12M or the Cubans". Rodolfo went ou to say that the
origin of tois rumor, as lar as he could ascertain, was the fact that
LIRiNG/3 had nade two trips into Havana for no known specificreason and
at bis own expense. Rodolfo Keyes, indicating that te himself did not
believe the runors or, at least, did not care whether they were true or
not, commented to LIRING/3 that other members of LIZING/3's profession
were naturally jealous of the success of anyone of their group and were
always quick to draw their own conclusions.

2. LIRING/3 co-:mented to Rowton that, although this news had shaken hi.
and LIRING/4 badly at the time, neither of them cared particularly whet
the LIRINGs thought of them, since their own conscience was clears. 1I-
RING/3 added that it was important, however, to continue to develop: bis
commercial ectivity in Ohiapas ( especially since acdolfo Reyes’ home is
by coincidence located in San Cristébal) so that sord ‘would gradually,
filter back to the LIklics that he actually did have financial resources
outside his art production. LIRING/3 continued that obviously the LIRLiGs
did not have any specific proof or they would long ago have cut off all
contact with hin as well as LIRING/4. He concluded that since the LIRIsGs
had certain suspicions, they naturally warned all bis friends and former
“eontacts (including, of course, 4rnol Rodriquez) to ayoid close contact :

: 3. In reply to Rowton's query LIRING/3 stated that woe Reyes and Carmen
Kolina (separately) had commented to him that they sere favorably ispresseu
by Rowton ard did not voice any suspicion of Rowton's bona fides (as a
Greek leftist businesswan). Carmen Mohina, in fact, had gone so far as to

show some irritation that LIRING/3 had not introduced her to Rowton pre=
wiously since she was anxious to develop some sort of lucrative business

deaiing witn him, Carmen Molina comnented to LIZ::G/3 that she felt
sure she could help Howton in his business ard’ politicel problems and
at the saue tine make a little suca-needed money for ker own living
expenses. ‘

4, LIRG/3 continued that he had been maintaining discreet ‘personal

contact with Carmen Lozada over the week-end ( he commented that LIRING/4

has already shown some sisns of fealousy and thereZore he md to be careful

2 not to_give her cause to distrust him). LIzIh3/3 stated that Carmen Lo--
zada had told hin that her father, a well-to-do Mexican doctor residing
in Coyacai, had remarried tand that her step-motzer was a Cuben sicentist
wus Led daved wauy year: an Mexico. She added that both her father and
step-ootber were on excellent social terms with Ambassador Herrdudez Armas.
She revealed that she oad already notified her husband, Snrique Ramirez,
tk-t she intended to divorce him, and she expected a storm of protest bota.
froa him ( in Havana) and her father and step-mother, both of whos were
“puritanic" despite their “progressive” convictions. She added that she
expected Snrique Ramirez to rush over from Havana as soon as he received
her letter and to appeal to her fzther and step-zother to save his mar-
vise. She, however, insisted to LIKIiG/3 that she hed made up her mibd
that she woulé go through with the divorce. She added tzat for this reason
she dia not wish to live with her father and had decidei to stay with.
her friend, Carmen Molina, until the divopce papers were through and ‘the
storm had blown over. She added that she did not particularly like being
@ house-guest in the sali aprtment of Carmen *olinc, but at the moment
- she had no choice. :
