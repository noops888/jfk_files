cautious, and somewhat defensive. Subject maintained she had no
detailed knowledge of the newly formed Communist Party of the
U.S.A. (Marxist-Leninist) in Los Angéles, the Ad Hoc Committee for
a Marxist-Leninist Party in Chicago or other Pro-Chinese groups.

noted that ARMAND's visit was the first contact with U.S. Marxist-
Leninists and he had asked her for a survey of the situation in
the U.S., but she had cut him off and insisted on confining her
remarks to the EPION case.

8. SUGAR described Subject as about 45 to 50: years old,

5 feet tall, and of squarish build, with derk hair and a "Slavic"
appearance. -
