ANUML POR THE ROCURD

SUBIOT: Thlk by Frnesto Betanccurt at the Cooperative Forua,

1, Tis fe 4 report fro: nesory of the highlights of the talk gives
by Dr, Erneoto Betancourt, Wecnecday nicht, 26 Geptender 1562, end of the
question and answer period folloviug it, at the Cooperative Ferea to

Washington, DsCe

2. Dr. Betancourt wns announced ns the political advieer of fercito
Libertador de Cuba, "an organization of youag Cuban allitnry leaders in
exile.” Currently hie full tine cccupation was stated as that of a
coordinator in the Departoent of Ecoaoaic Affairs of the Organization of
Acarican States (SAS). In the early days of tho Castro regine be had beeo
&n enthusinstic "Fidelista” and had served as Director of tlie Central Bank
of Cubs (pre Che Guevarra) and as one of Castro's first representatives
in the U. 8, Iie soon became disenchanted, defected and becane a leader

in the anti-Castro movement.

3. Based on mental notes of Betancourt's speech (about 40 nioutes)
and of his cnuswers given to questions froa the audience (a typical,
dLatinguished cross-section crop found at the Forum), the folloving
appenred to be the aoct significant statements:

a, There are n0 “easy” ansvere to the Cubso problea
which has becone increasingly couplex,

d. ‘The singly cost inportant Soviet objective in
“taking over” Cuba 13 to-diseredit the U. 8.
by alternately deaonstrating ite “woakness”
and ite “wickedness.” By showing that the U.8,
ts willicg to. recein supine eves in the face of a
nilitary-aid “presence” in Cuba, the Soviets
believe they can score a psychological victory which
will inpress other Latin American countries and
perhaps other developing aress in which the U. 8,
has an ioterect. -Sinultaneously the Coomuniats
continue to dcztet the "gringues” as creas,
money-seeking imperialists who vant to “do in
poor little Cute. This creation of an unfavorable
image of. the U. 8, is far more important to the
Krenlin than any other reason for their cow large
Cuban ‘effort. ‘Eveo the possible uee of Cuba as
a missile base is of secondary importance.

c. As for making Cuba a Cocmunist “showcase”
Betancourt believes the Soviets have no such
hope or eveo intention. They do however intend
to use Cuba as the CP “headquarters” for Lotin

HE Anerica and have tn fact been dofog so for som
tine. :

4. ‘The attecpted invasion vae a dieaster all arouud -
militarily, politically and ideologically. Among
other causes of thie failure wna CIA's “kidnapping”
of the Revolutionsry Commeil so that avy effective
anti-Castro leadership was rendered poverleas.

@, The “burcling” of the favezton vas to part due to
the “esamucicationa void" that existed eo far as
getting anti-Castro informtion through to the
Cubsa people. In the meantime Castro had full
cootrl over hie intercal communications and
aaturated” the air vavos vith pro-resine
propaganda coucerning the fovasioa.

f. Castro 4s still the real “boss” tn Cube oven
though be 1a surrounded ‘by Coumuniste and ts
generally obedient to Moscow's orders. -The
Krealin bas oot pushed him too far - ia fact
they have in sone instances pulled hin back
for they feel that he has a tendency to be
reckless. For instance, the Soviets did not
really vant hin to break with the U. 8. and
would hove wanted hin to be a clever "Marxist"
tactician, Ths Krelin {6 smart enough to
realize, hovever, that 1f Castro were elininated
bia entire resize vould collapse. 80 while
dictating to hin-in certain respects, they also
have to give hin leevay. In other words the
Commnists are “using” Castro but at the sane
tins are being used by lim for the echieverent
of his ova ego-pover objectives.

g+ Econoate conditions in Cuba are really very bad.
In the general disarray of. the Cuban. econony,
acriculture is faring vorst cf all. Por the
first tins in Cuban history, food te betag
aoverely rationed. Also for the first tine
the usar crop has not been planted this year,
due to the ceneral disorder and the inability
to provide inceatives for the sugar plantation
pecs. Soviet economic ald ts insufficent thus
fer to have any visible effect in Lifting the
econoey. The Soviets are apparently giving
much more ailitary than econonic aid.

h, | Betancourt 1s opposed to military interventica
by U. S. on general principles but feels that’
ifthe U, 6 did decide to {ntervene it vould
de far more Justified in the eyes cf Latin-
Azerica than vould bave been the cease before
the Soviets decided to totervene aflitarily.

1, One of the best propaganda targets froa the U.S,
point af view 1s the Castro militia. According
to Betaccourt the militiamen are “restive abouts
the Cocmmuaist docination of Cuba. A large number
of these nen vere ardeut rebels but not Communists,
‘They fought with Castro against the Batista dictator-
ship but vot in order to establish a Communist
regize, ucr even ts make Cuba @ “socialist” state,

Talx by Exnesto Betancourt at the Cooperative Forum,

These aflittanen vould be mich sore reoponsive
to U. B. appealo if they did not feel that to
the event of anti-Castro take crer they would be
Uquidated. They feel that the Us 3, and rebel
Propaganda has depicted thea all as major
eueales ang inmedinte targets for destruction.
Betancourt believes ve should proceed to correct.
this propaganda error at ouce.
je Betancourt feels that the OAS could be much more
7 “> @ffective than it hao been so fur if only aga
“forum for airing the truth about the Castro i
regime and for hardening the attitudes of the
reat. of Latin America tovard the expansion of
Soviet satellites in the vestern bentephere.
Betancourt believes that the overt Soviet
intervention in Cuba hae jarred the Latio
Avericans for more than the fact of the -
triumph of Comunisa, per se, in that country,
