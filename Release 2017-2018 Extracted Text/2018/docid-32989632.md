to Mr. Felt. Each was then approved by Mr. Hoover. Reports prepared .
from review of the logs were delivered to the Attorney General as well as
the White House, so there was no question at any time that the Attorney
General was not aware of the coverage. Propriety of the coverage was
never in doubt at any time. It was unquestionably related to the national
security, and the necessity for maintaining the fewest possible records
relating to the coverage was obvious. This was the reason why no letter
was sent to the Attorney General requesting and getting individual written
approvals. This was the reason the coverage was reported by blind
memorandum on unwatermarked bond paper. This was the reason the
records. were retained under heavy security in Mr. Felt's Office. This
was the reason that only a very few persons were privy to the coverage.
The possibility of our coverage being leaked to Jack Anderson was very
real and very great. At the time, some of the Bureau's tightly held matter,
were appearing in public print and the need for secrecy was apparent. Ce)

It is to be noted that following John N. Mitchell's resignation
as Attorney General, no further reports relating to the coverage were
delivered to the Attorney General's Office. Mr. Felt inquired of Attorney

General Kleindienst if he desired to continue to get the reports and he —
replied in effect that he did not know anything about the coverage and did
not want any reports relating to it.

Insofar as other records maintained, there were no records in

the electronic indices. However, Mr. Hoover instructed that the number

of wiretaps be included in the overall number of wiretaps which was a part

of his testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee, and a part of

the total number which had a definite ceiling. In other words when the total
. number of wiretaps permitted by Mr. Hoover at any given time included one

of the To wiretaps, other national security taps were reduced by this

as such coverage was in furtherance of efforts by the President to protect
national ad information, which function was excepted in the Keith
decision. (6a) :

It is to be noted that in connection with wiretaps placed in

this instance, no written authority was ever obtained from the Attorney General.
The initial request came from the Attorney General in personal instructions

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Charles Edward Radford Il
Sensitive Coverage for the White House’
COVE - Espionage

to Mr. Felt. Each was then approved by Mr. Hoover. Reports prepared
from review of the logs were delivered to the Attorney General as well as
the White House, so there was no question at any time that the Attorney
General was not aware of the coverage. Propriety of the coverage was
never in doubt at any time. It was unquestionably related to the national
security, and the necessity for maintaining the fewest possible records
relating to the coverage was obvious. This was the reason why no letter
was sent to the Attorney General requesting and getting individual written
approvals. This was the reason the coverage was reported by blind
memorandum on unwatermarked bond paper. This was the reason the
records were retained under heavy security in Mr. Felt's Office. This
was the reason that only a very few persons were privy to the coverage.
The possibility of our coverage being leaked to Jack Anderson was very
real and very great. At the time, some of the Bureau's tightly held matters
were appearing in public print and the need for secrecy was apparent.

It is to be noted that following John N. Mitchell's resignation
as Attorney General, no further reports relating to the coverage were
| . ‘delivered to the Attorney General's Office. Mr. Felt inquired of Attorney
- General Kleindienst if he desired to continue to get the reports and he
| replied in effect that he did not know anything about the coverage and did
{ 7 not want any reports relating to it.
i

Insofar as other records maintained, there were no records in
the electronic indices. However, Mr. Hoover instructed that the number
of wiretaps be included in the overall number of wiretaps which was a part
of his testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee, and a part of
the total number which had a definite ceiling. In other words when the total
number of wiretaps permitted by Mr. Hoover at any given time included one
of the Radford wiretaps, other national security taps were reduced by this

number. ¢€C)

It was previously reported that teach-ins and other
actions are to be held throughout the U.S, this week to -
protest pollution and to educate individuals on the causes
of environmental pollution. The idea for this activity is
attributed to Senator Gaylord Nelson (D.-Wisc.). The main
activities are to be held on 4/22/70 throughout the U.S.
Environmental Action was formed at Washington, D. C., to
help organize and coordinate the activities on 4/22/70, which
has been designated “Earth Day."

ws

We have surveyed our field offices to determine
activities planned on 4/22/70 and to determine whether

| militant groups will participate. We have determined that
j activities will be held in at least 33 states and the

[District of Columbia. ' fe

: ‘At Boulder, Col., a teach-in will be held at the 7
University of Colorado. Groups sponsoring this teach~in
have agreed to support the Student Mobilization Committee to
End the War in Vietnam (SMC), which is controlled by the
Young Socialist Alliance, in its demands that the Reserve
Officers Training Corps (ROTC) be eliminated from the campus,
that the University end research for the Government, and that
students be given control of corporate recruiting on the

campus.

_ The highlights of this activity are as follows:

S,

At Washington, D. C., the Washington Area Environmental
Coalition is sponsoring various demonstrations on 4/22/70. A
march will be held from 21st Street and Constitution Avenue
to the Department of the Interior and then to the Sylvan
Theater where a rally will be held. Pete Seeger, a nationally }
known folk singer who is a former member of the Communist fy

Plaza, Boston. Following the rally, a funeral procession
will be held to Logan Airport. The funeral procession is to
commemorate victims of the war in Vietnam, racism, and
pollution. The demonstrators will present coffins to Pan
American Airways and United Air Lines.

At Michigan State University, East Lansing, Mich.,
the Committee to Defend the Conspiracy 7, a group which
supports the violence-prone Weatherman faction of SDS, plans

On December 6, 1967, Ray Allred, Attorney,
Salt Lake City Prosecutor's Office, Salt
Lake City, Utah, made available informa-
tion indicating that Steve Holbrook was
one of eight demonstrators who were found
guilty of trespassing in Salt Lake City
Court on November 30, 1967, and was issued
a ten-day suspended sentence and a fine of
$50.00 on December 5, 1967.

On April 22, 1970, the following information was
furnished by the first confidential source mentioned above
concerning activities held in conjunction with the Festival
Of Life at Sugarhouse Park on April 18, 1970. These activi-
ties were also observed by a Special Agent of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

The Festival of Life Rally, which was also known as
the Celebration Of Earth Day, began at 1:30 pm in the south-
eastern section of Sugarhouse Park, Salt Lake City, Utah,
These activities were sponsored by the United Front To End The
War and the Coalition To End Pollution, both groups being from
the Salt Lake City area. The coordinators-of these activities

the height* of the activities, there were approximately 3,000
persons in attendance at this rally, with the featured speaker
being Billingsly Brown, a Professor of Chemical Engineering at
the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, Brown spoke on
pollution in the Salt Lake Valley, with particular emphasis on
the contributions to pollution made by Kennecott Corporation.

the valley and indicated they were the principal violators and
contributors to the pollution problem. The programalso includ~
eda speech made by Jan Andrews, an Instructor or Ecology at
the University of Utah, who spoke on pollution in generad and

was not well received by the crowd. H

On July 23, 1969, Dr. Palmer Se“Ross,

mands of the Salt Lake City Commission,
which is the organization directly involved

Steve Holbrook also spoke at the rally. His comments
dealt briefly with the pollution problem, and he also mentioned
a confrontation the Coalition To End Pollution group had en-
countered with the Salt Lake City Parks Department in getting
access to Sugarhouse Park for this rally.

This Festival Of Life was held for the stated purpose
of educating those in attendance to the problems of pollution
and the Vietnam war. The majority of people in attendance at
this rally were students,who paid very little attention to the
speakers. A rock band known as The Poll's provided music, and
some members of the audience participated in dancing, which haa
been forbidden in the rules of conduct set forth by the Salt
Lake City Commission for this affair.

The following placards were observed being carried by
some members of the audience:

"Problem, Pollution-~Solution, Jesus"

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Demo-
eratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into being
at a founding convention held at Port Huron, Michigan, in
June, 1962. From an initial ideological posture of “parti-
cipatory democracy," the current line of the national leader-
ship reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism. Michael
Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the
building of a revelutionary Marxist-Leninist movement. The
program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights
struggles to an anti-Vietnam war position and finally to its
present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking up the
oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America with the
black liberation movement in the United States. China,
Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are leading-

i the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism.
. On the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperi-
alist power and does not support the policies of that country.

i SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608

West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper

t "New Left Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership
and program adopted at meetings of the National Council and

a National Interim Committee (NIC). Three national officers
i and a NIC of eleven members are elected each year during a
7 June National Convention.

: SDS Regional Offices and university and college
chapters elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein
program and ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter
is autonomous in nature aud is free to comry out independent
policy and programs reflective of local conditions.

NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIONS, APRIL 22, 1970

On April 22, 1870, Special Agents of the FBI
observed a group of approximately 300 Spanish-Americans
gathered at Tingley Park, Albuquerque. The group led by a
youth on horseback proceeded through the lower income Barelas

area of Albuquerque to the 1900 block Southwest of Second
_ Street.

\

Signs observed among the group were "Stop Polluting
Our Land. Get Out Now," "Overpopulation is Everyone's

Problem," Viva La Raza, >" "Chicano Power" and "Keep Your Pollution.
_ Give Us Life."

At the rally several persons spoke, some objecting
to the location of the sewage plant and others objecting to

other aspects of pollution, The march and subsequent rally

was peaceful and orderly. :

: The April 23, 1970 "Albuquerque Journal" contained
an article captioned "Rites on 'Earth Day' Join Many Together"-
wherein it was noted that the Chicano Earth Day formed by

the UMAS from UNM which originally planned its rally at a
sewage treatment plant in Albuquerque moved to another
location due to a lack of space in front of the sewage plant.

Confidential informants familiar with certain
activities of the New Left militant groups, and other subver-"
sive activities in the State of New Mexico were contacted
in March and April, 1970, and could furnish no information
concerning Earth Day activities.

WDC area. Since February, 1970, a "movement" has gotten
under way made up of a coalition of students and conservation
organizations, with support coming largely from the white,
middle class. April 22nd, "Earth Day"! will climax with a
march to the Interior Department in the afternoon by students
and conservation organizations headed by representatives of
the Sierra Club.

On April 14, 1970, the Washington ‘Area Environ-
mental Coalition held a press conference at the Dupont Plaza
Hotel, WDC, Robert Waldrop spoke for the coalition and, ,
“stated that "Earth Day'' activities on April 22nd, were being
organized by the coalition which consists of interested stu-
dents from American University, Catholic University, Trinity
College, George Washington University, and Prince Georges
Community College, Maryland, working closely with the Ener-
gency Committee on the Transportation Crisis (ECTC). Environ-

Volpe would be speaking before the highway users conference.

Waldrop announced plans for April 22nd, saying that

On April 22, 1970, representatives of the FBI
observed about 200 persons on the Playing Fields shortly
after 1:30 p.m. They were joined a few minutes later
by a contingent of George Washington University students
who arrived chanting "Save Our Earth."

A brief speech followed by which an unidentified
GWU Law School student spoke out against Secretary of
the Interior Hickel,and the administrations of both Presi-

action regarding pollution. - i "

About 2 p.m., the group, numbering about 750
persons, moved out in the direction of the Interior De~

we want water, we want Hickel."

About 2:30 p.m., the group at the Interior Depart-
ment left and joined another group gathered at the Sylvan

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Demo-
cratic Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being
at a founding convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron, Mich-
igan. From an initial posture of "participatory democracy" the
line of the national leadership has revealed a growing Marxist-
Teninist adherence which currently calls for the building of a
revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently, the program of
SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-Vietnam
_ War stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist position.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders of worldwide
struggles against United States imperialism whereas the Soviet
Union is held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

isinhimatecalire cai ot abi nig

SES Na a

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive
Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expelled. As
a result, the National Office (NO) group maintained its National
Headquarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, and the PLP
faction set up headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This
headquarters subsequently moved to Boston. Each grour elected
. its own national officers, which include three national secre- 7
taries and a National Interim Committee of eight. Both the NO
forces and the PLP forces claim to be the true SDS. Both groups
also print their versions of "New Left Notes" which sets forth
the line and the program of the particular faction. .The NO
version of 'New Left Notes" was recently printed under the title
“The Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass appeal.

a

Two major factions have developed internally within
the NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth
Movement (RYM) I faction, and the RYM II faction. Weatherman
is action-oriented upholding Castro's position that the duty of
revolutionaries is to make revolution. Weatherman is regarded
by RYM II as an adventuristic, elitist faction which denies
the historical role of the working class as the base for revo-
lution. RYM II naintains that revolution, although desired, is
not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes organizing



“4

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIFTY

and raising the political consciousness of the working class
upon whom they feel successful revolution depends. Although
disclaiming control and domination by the Communist Party,
USA, leaders in these two factions have in the past proclaimed
themselves to be communists and to follow the precepts of a
Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP faction
which is more commonly known as the Worker Student Alliance
is dominated and controlled by members of the PLP, who are

- required to identify themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-
Leninist philosophy of the PLP. . They advocate that an al-
liance between workers and students-is vital to the bringing
about of a revolution in the United States.

shop

_ SDS regions and university and college chapters, although
operating under the outlines of the SDS National Constitution,
are autonomous in nature and free to carry out independent policy
reflective of local conditions. Because of this autonomy internal
struggles reflecting the major factional interests of SDS have
occurred at the chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70
school year.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY (PLP)

_ "The New York Times" city edition, Tuesday, April 20,
1965, page 27, reported that a new party of "revolutionary
socialism'' was formally founded on April 18, 1965, under the
name of the PLP which had been known as the Progressive Labor
Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor
Movement was founded in 1962, by Milton Rosen and Mortimer
Scheer after they were expelled from the Communist Party of
. the United States for assertedly following the Chinese Com-
munist line." He

A source advised on June “3, 1968, that the PLP held
“its Second National Convention in New York City, May 31 to
June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its objective
of the establishment of a militant working class movement
based on Marxism-Leninism. This is to be accomplished through
the Party's over-all revolutionary strategy of raising the
consciousness of the people and helping to provide ideological
leadership in the working class struggle for state power.

The source also advised that at the Second National
Convention Milton Rosen was unanimously re-elected National
Chairman of the PLP and Levi Laub, Fred Jerome, Jared Israel,
William Epton, Jacob Rosen, Jeffrey Gordon, and Walter Linder
were elected as the National Committee to lead the PLP until
the next convention,

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor,” a bimonthly
magazine; “World Revolution,'' a quarterly pertodical; and
"Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper.

The April, 1969, issue of "Challenge-Desafio" sets
forth that "Challenge is dedicated to the peoples fight for
a new way of life-~-where the working men and women control
their own homes and factories; where they themselves make
up the entire government on every level and control the
schools, courts, police and all institutions which are now
used to control them."

Assistant to the Director Williara C. Sullivan called and advised
there was an urgent matter he wanted to take up with me by phone as
Mr. Richard Moore, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, has
called Assistant Director Bishop and himself from the White House,
Mr. Moore was at that time over at the i hite House with Ronald Ziegler,
Press Secretary to the President. Mr. Moore said they were going to go
to a press meeting around four o'cicck and they wanted from us over the
telephone, a general statement to explain why we ‘had a reason for covering
the-National Environmental Action\meciing that Senator Edmund S. Muskie
(D. “Saine) is complaining about, Mir, Sullivan said a brief statement
has been worked out and proceeded to read as follows:

He "Senatur Muskie has publicly condemned the FBI for having
concerned itself with Earih Day rallies heid throughout the United States
on April 22, 1970. He noted that no erime or threat of crime was involved
nor was any violence threatened. Senator Muskie has deplored the fact that .
the FBI issued confidential reports on this matter to other Government
agencies, The Senator from S{aine declared there was no justification for
any part of the Federal intelivence community observing and reporting
legitimate political events which do not affect our national security or
involve a potential for crime.

'% is most unfortunate that after having come into possession
of FDI cocumenis relating to this matter Senator Muskie did not take the
time to seek an answer te the questions he raised on the floor of the Senate.
Sad Mr. Muskie voiced his concern to me, he would have found that almost
from the moment the Barth rallies were announced, reports were received

‘Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson and Bishop - April 14, 1971

The FBI's sole purpose in collecting and reporting information
regarding this matter was to determine the extent of efforts by extremist
elements to exploit or disrupt these. activities for their own purposes. There
have been prior gatherings in Washington of large numbersof people which
resulted in violence and considerable damage was done."

Itold Mr. Sullivan I thought that was all right.

I said collateral to this, I had sent a note through to check out the
dissemination of that report and asked if that were Media and Mr. Sullivan
said it was not. I said I would surmise some agency in Washington gave this
out. Mr, Sullivan said it was disseminated to Secret Service and some other
agencies. J told him to run it down at every agency | and ask to see > their copy.
Mr, Sullivan said he would. :

Very truly yours,

The Deputy Attorney General

It is noted that Senator Huskie'’s release presenta
a highly slanted and misleading picture of this matter, The
following points are noted in this connection:

(1) He rationalizes his public release of an officia

FRI document by first noting that it is not one of thosa items
Stolen from our Hedia, Pennsylvania, Resident Agency, and that
4% contained no classified designation, While the letterhead
Memorandum was not classified, it did contain the specific

- precautionary statement that it was the property of the FBL
and that it and its sontents are not to be distributed outside
of the recipient agency.

(2) Muskie asserted that the rallies contained ne
hint of violence,, tet; sperking on the sane platform with
Huskie was Rennie Davis whose earlier public utterances

4. resulted in his conviction on a charge of inciting to riot.
Huskie covipletely ignored the statement made by Davia in his
speech at the raily which “called for tearing down the
- gapitalist structure,” Davis further stated that one way
to fight for ecology would be te go to New Haver "to stop
Bobby Seale's trial," Davis's statetent calling for the
destruction of the capitalist structure could hardly be
considered a point dealing with ecology and cortaisiy,
- implies more than 2 “hint of violence." mn

(3) Senator Huskie asserts that the memorandum in
question had been widely cirecnlated to the entire intelligence
‘community, and perhaps even to local police, This not true.
The letterhead memorandua in question was dissominated to
the three military intelligence agencies, the Department,
and the Secret Service.

: (4) Sonntor Huskie stated that the FRI report

-eoupled an analysis of his activities at the “Earth pay"

‘vally with a dissertation on the Students for 2 Deaceratic
Society (£53) and the Progressive Labor Party (PLP), cur
information contained in the letterhesa gandua did no
sueh thing, References to the SDS and the PLP were attached
aS an appendix to the document and offered a thumbnail sketch
on both organizations since cach was wcntioncd in the bouy
ef the docwient. e only mention uskie was to factually
note that he srvived at the rally, gave a guort antipcliution
speech (contents of this speech were not set out), and wag

’ £ollowed by the next speaker.

Mrs. Hogan

aad In introducing a resolution to establish a Joint Committee on *

39 Individual Rights in the U.S. Congress, Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-Wisconsin)

® called for an effort to bring the "Government's surveillance and snooping a
_é powers under effective Congressional control and review immediately." if }

3 Senator Nelson made reference in the resolution to the FBI surveillance of the ¥
N Earth Day Rally in Washington, D. C., on 4/22/70. Mae

The following facts regarding FBI activity on Earth Day are set

forth for the information of the Acting Director.
Ya FCF UIE ~ SoS; fea, )

Publicity regarding the FBI's interest in Earth Day, 1970, was Ns
revealed on 4/14/71 when Senator Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) released an
FBI letterhead memorandum (LHM) which summarized the results of activity
in Washington, D. C., on 4/22/70 in connection with a nationwide ecology and
environmental program called Earth’Day. This LHM was prepared by our
Washington Field Office (WFO) under date of 6/10/70 and was an unclassified
document which was disseminated by WFO to FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) and the
Alexandria and Baltimore Divisions. At FBIHQ dissemination was made to’

Secret Service, the Department of Justice and three military intelligence
agencies. We were unable to determine how Senator Muskie received a copy

of the above LHM. . ST-Lil REC-39Z-0) ave 2 2p co |

WFO's coverage of the rally was prompted by instructions from
FBIHQ. In this regard, it is pointed out that on 3/23/70 a representative of
the White House (Jack Caulfield) contacted the Bureau and advised that
Mr. Ehrlichman at the White House was interested in any information the Bureau
could secure regarding the involvement of radical groups in the ecology move-
ment. On 3/27/70 we directed a communication to all FBI field offices calling

Re: Earth Day Rally, 1970

attention to the upcoming Earth Day activities and instructing that established
sources be alerted and close liaison be maintained with appropriate agencies"
to insure that we developed relevant information concerning subversive or
violence-prone persons participating in these activities.

A total of 50 field offices reported information of one kind or
another concerning the Earth Day events. They involved a total of 57 separate
rallies or functions. In the great majority of instances no violence was reported
although 13 individuals were arrested at a Boston demonstration and in the “ -
Florida area a group of persons tried to leave garbage near the President's
home in Key Biscayne. In three instances, activities on the part of subversive
elements were reported.

In the Washington, D. C., rally in addition to Senator Muskie,
the speakers included three individuals of security interest; namely, I. F. q
Stone, Phil Ochs, and Rennie Davis. Stone had been identified as a Communist
Party, USA, member in the 1930s and was publisher of "I. F. Stone's Weekly,"
an independent newsletter. He consistently espoused the interests of the Communist
Party front groups. Ochs had stated previously that he considered himself a
communist although he was not a Communist Party member. Ochs was involved in
antiwar demonstrations and had been arrested in Chicago in 1968 because of his
participation in a street incident during the Democratic National Convention.’
Davis held various leadership positions in the militant Students for a Democratic
Society in the mid-1960s and had long opposed the Vietnam war. He was convicted
for violating the Antiriot Law and for conspiracy in connection with his activity.
in the Democratic National Convention in 1968. His. conviction was later -
overturned.

Stone, Ochs and Davis spoke against pollution, the Vietnam war
and the Nixon Administration. Davis, whose remarks included obscene
comments, called for the tearing down of the capitalistic structure.and for
support of Black Panther Party (BPP) leader Bobby Seale in connection with Seale's
trial on a charge of murder relating to the torture killing of a BPP member.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller
Re: Earth Day Rally, 1970

Individuals also of security interest with subversive backgrounds
were active in Earth Day events at Salt Lake City, Utah, and Tempe, Arizona.
Pertinent information developed by the FBI regarding Earth Day activity
throughout the country was furnished to the White House, the Attorney General,
the Secret Service and the three military intelligence agencies.

FBI coverage of Earth Day activities was aimed strictly at identifying
involvement of subversive or violence-prone elements. To a degree, at least,
our coverage was prompted by the prior expression of White House interest in 3
learning the extent of the radical participation in the ecology movement. In addition,
the subversive or violence-prone elements at that time are kriown to capitalize
on events sponsored by legitimate nonviolent and dissenting organizations by con-"
ducting disruptive acts, by distributing literature or by collecting funds at those
events.

Our coverage of Earth Day events was confined almost entirely to
the collection of information available through established sources (although in
four instances, including the Washington, D. C., rally, Bureau personnel did
cover the activities) and no open inquiries were conducted.

Senator Nelson has apparently referred to our coverage of the
Earth Day Rally in order to garner support for his resolution calling for a Joint
Committee on Individual Rights.

this was a very critical and sensitive matter and that he would

be very glad to give me full details later on; however, action was
needed at once. He stated he would be glad to have someone call me
to confirm his authority in this matter. I told him there was no
need of this, inasmuch as I knew of his position at the White House.

was explained to the AG, the matter might drag. Smith told me
he understood and would immediately call the AG and would have
the AG call us relative to this matter. 2e3(v)

I have issued instructions to Inspector Sizoo of the
Domestic Intelligence Division to institute an immediate
physical surveillance of the South Vietnamese Embassy, in an effort
to identify visitors going into that Embassy. The Domestic
Intelligence Division has also been told to prepare, in writing,
a communication to the AG, requesting approval for the wire-tap.
Despite the fact that the AG will undoybtedly give verbal approval,
we should still have this in writing. A)

ADDENDUM — : : :

Bromley Smith called me back at 10:35 a.m. and indicated
he had talked with the AG concerning this matter, The AG at first
questioned the fact that Smith had called him on a White House direct
line, rather than coming over personally. Smith stated he told the
AG that time was running out and the White House did not have time to
come over to the AG's office. The AG replied that Dick Helms of
CIA usually came over on a personal basis,

Smith stated he had explained to the AG why the wire-tap
was needed immediately, The AG replied he thought a wire-tap had
been placed on the South Vietnamese Embassy last week. Smith told
him that, according to the FBI, this was not true. The AG stated 4
that, in view of the urgency of the situation, there appeared to be rs
no problem, but this was a rather unusual way of handling the matter. |
The AG next told Smith that he would await a call from the FBI. 2

ALBUQUERQUE TO MRS. CHENNAULT ? ¥
OR SOUTH VIETNAMESE EMBASSY

ON NOVEMBER 2, 1968” Ly ehing onic

For record purposes, at President | Lyndon B. Johnson's
ty request, SAC Jordan, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was instructed on 11712,
‘YW Havé a careful check made of all outgoing phone calls made by the then

| Vice Presidential candidate Spiro Agnew on the date of November 2, 1968, at;
the time he was in Albuquerque.

SAC Jordan called back 11/13/68 and reported that Governor Agnew's
campaign American Airlines charter: plane arrived in Albuquerque at 11:44
a.m., November 2, 1968. It departed at 2:10 p.m. for Harlingen, Texas.
There were three phones placed on his plane at the time of arrival. Numbers
of these telephones were 247-1448, 247-1449 and 247-1440. The last two he
mentioned phones were never used.. There were five phone calls either made/ s
from or charged to the first listed number. Three of these calls were ‘
specifically made from this phone while two were made from a pay station at
the airport near this phone. :

songlate

At 11:59 a.m., Governor Agnew personally made a call to Washington, :
| |p. C., area code 202, 737-5800, to Secretary of State Dean Rusk. The call
imately t i 2, “.
lasted approximately three minutes. REC 64 6 <x cee: e- a b C
| The second call was made at 12:16 p.m. by staff member Kent Crane
| from a pay phone, 299-9920, which was chargeable, to the above listed first
|p on the plane. This call was made to Harlingen, Texas, to ajMr. Cal

Purdy. Gade 4 1968 :
¢ abe 4) Lp

At 3:10 p.m. a third call was madé bytife"same K nt Crane’ to
New York City from the same pay phone and chargeable to the first listed phone
on the plane. The call to New York was made to area code 212, 288-8444,
i This call lasted approximately nine minutes and forty seconds. (Investigation
| by the New York Office has subsequently shown that this telephone number isa . :
\ listed number and the subscriber is Bruce Friedle, a sculptor, 304 East 75th
Street, New York City. He has the entire floor and has had service there

prior to 1966. Mr. Friedle also has an outside extension to this phone at 2 v 0

C. D. DeLoach to Mr. Tolson
Re: Check of Phone Calls from Albuquerque

The fourth call was made to Mr. Jim Miller, New York City,
whose telephone number is area code 212, 661-6400. This call lasted
approximately two minutes and 22 seconds,

The fifth and last call was made at 1:02 p.m. by Kent Crane to a
Mr. Hitt in Washington, D. C., to telephone number area code 202, 783-4201,

which number is listed to Nixon-Agnew Campai dquarters. This call
lasted for one minute and 51 seconds and this phone is chargeable to Maurice

Stans, at the said Nixon-Agnew Campaign Headquarters. i aaa F

SAC Jordan reported that there had been no toll calls from
Albuquerque to the South Vietnamese Embassy, Washington, D. C., or none
to the telephone number of Mrs. Claire Chennault, Washington, D. C. He
also reported that in the event there had been credit card calls from
Albuquerque to Washington, D. C., it would be impossible to trace these
calls in Albuquerque inasmuch as all such charges are routed to Baltimore,

aryland, for administrative handling. (The Baltimore Office has not been
structed to check these later possibilities. It takes approximately thirty
lays for them to be coordinated. ) :

The above information was furnished telephonically to the Director
on 11/13/68.

President Lyndon B, Johnson. called at approximately 4:00 p.m.,
11/13/68, and asked concerning f progress regarding ‘the above matter. He
was given. the specific details as enumerated above on a verbatim basis.
instructed that, a. check be, made to. determine if the fifth call to a Mr. Hitt
n-Agnéw Campaign Headquarters could possibly have been made to
Mrs. “Chennault. He stated he understood that we were physically surveilling
Mrs, Chennault attthé time and therefore ar record should haye been made of
her .whereabouts so that a determination could bé made concerning whether
she was at Nixon-Agnew Headquarters at the time (1:02 p.m., 11/2/68).

I told him this would be done. He also asked that Washington, D.C.
toll calls be checked to ascertain if there had been any phone calls from
Mrs, Chennault or’ the South Vietnamese Embassy to New Mexico, Texas,
or Los Angeles on the date of November 2, 1968.

At 3:00 p.m. on 11/15/68 J called Jim Jones, Special Assistant to
the President, and indicated that our surveillance on Mrs. Chennault as of

11/2/68 reflected that she remained at home until approximately 1:30 p.m.
that date at which time she departed for Baltimore, Maryland. Talso ult

C. D. DeLoach to Mr. Tolson ‘
Re: Check of Phone Calls from Albuquerque

him that toll call checks in Washington, D. C., failed to reflect receipt of any
calls by her or made from her to New Mexico, Texas or California. I told
him that we were not checking credit card calls in Baltimore inasmuch as this
appeared to be a waste of time.

The same information as reflected in the foregoing paragraphs was
given to Bromiley Smith, Foreign Intelligence Advisor to the President, as of
11/18/68, when he called and made inquiry concerning another phase of this
matter. Neither Smith nor Jones asked for further investigation concerning
this matter.

No further investigation is being conducted as of this time other than
the technical installation on the South Vietnamese Embassy which was specifically
requested by the White House and subsequently approved by the Attorney General.

Re: Check of Phone Calls from Albuquerque

The fourth call was made to Mr. Jim Miller, New York City,

approximately two minutes and 22 seconds.

The fifth and last call was made at 1:02 p.m. by Kent Crane to a
Mr. Hitt in Washington, D. C., to telephone.number area code 202, 783-4201,

which number is listed to Nptone Senew Sampaisn Headquarters. This call
lasted for one minute and 51 seconds and this phone is chargeable to Maurice

Stans, at the said Nixon-Agnew Campaign Headquarters. Se

SAC Jordan reported that there had been no toll calls from
Albuquerque to the South Vietnamese Embassy, Washington, D. C., or none
to the telephone number of Mrs. Claire Chennault, Washington, D..C. He
also reported that in the event there had been credit card calis from
Albuquerque to Washington, D. C., it would be impossible to trace these
calls in Albuquerque inasmuch as all such charges are routed to Baltimore,

yiand, for administrative handling. (The Baltimore Office has not been
instructed to check these later possibilities. It takes approximately thirty
ys for them to be coordinated. )

The above information was furnished telephonically to the Director :
on 11/13/68, :

President Lyndon I johnson called at approximately 4:00 P. *
11/13/68, aid asked concerning progress regarding the abéve matter..
was given the specific details as enumerated above on a verbatim pedal
He_ instructed that a check be made to, determine if the fifth call to a Mr. Hitt
at Nixon-Agnew Campaign Headquarters could possibly have been made to
Mrs. ‘Chennault. He stated he understood that we were physically surveilling
Mrs. Chennault atthe time and therefore a. record should have been made of
her whereabouts so that a determination could Bé made concerning whether
she was at Nixon-Agnew Headquarters at the time (1:02 p.m. , 11/2/88).

I told him this would be done. He also asked that Washington, D. C.
toll calls be checked to ascertain if there had been any phone calls from
Mrs, Chennault or the South Vietnamese Embassy to New moe Texas,
or Los Angeles on the date of November 2, 1968.

At 3: 00 p.m. on 11/15/68 1 called Jim Jones, Special aeejetant to
the President, < and indicated that our surveillance on Mrs. Chennault as of

Call from Bromley Smith, Situation Room
White House, 10/30/68

Bromley Smith called from the White House at 5:50 p.m.
He stated that the President had just called him and had indicated that
the information furnished by the FBI today in the captioned case was
extremely significant. According to Smith, the President ordered that
the FBI begin an immediate surveillance of Mrs. Claire Chennault so that
it can be determined every place she went and every person she met with-
in the next several days.
ag REC-40 Gc Caose—/T7]
I told Smith that the obtaining of complete intelligence in
such an assignment would be almost an impossibility in view of the fact
prnuiets that Mrs. Chennault lived at the Watergate here in Washington and was
constantly involved in social activities. I stated that furthermore it was
widely known that she was involved in Republican political circles and, if
it became known that the FBI was surveilling her this would put us in a
- most ‘untenable and embarrassing position. Smith said he recognized this

| : |faet however, the President had given him a direct order and he was
passing it on to us.

Send pe

Smith also told me that the White House is as yet undecided
as to whether or not Mrs. Chennault is working for certain factions within
the United States (presumably the Republican Party) or if she is actually
working for the Hanoi Government. He stated that the President frankly
believes that she is an activist with respect to pedce negotiations and that
|: may Very-.well be that she is working for Hanoi. I again explained the

difficulties in instituting such a surveillance, however, told Smith we would
do what we could,

After checking with the Director, I issued instructions to -
; inspector Sizoo of the Domestic Intelligence Division that a loosé surveillance

: Call from Bromley Smith, Situation Room

White House, 10/30/68

Bromley Smith called from the White House at 5:50
He stated that the President had just called him and had indicated that
the information furnished by the FBI today in the captioned case was f
extremely significant. According to Smith, the President ordered that
the FBI begin an immediate surveillance of Mrs. Claire Chennault so that
it can be determined every Se she went and every person she met with-
in the next several days. i)

Ss)

such an assignment would be almost an impossibility in view of the fact
Mrs. Chennault lived at the Watergate here in Washington and was
constantly involved in social activities. I stated that furthermore it was
widely known that she was involved in Republican political circles and, if
it became known that the FBI was surveilling her this would put us in a “
most ‘untenable and embarrassing position. Smith said he recognized this z
jee however, the President had given him a direct order and he was :
passing it on to us. (v) : eterna

LASSIFIED BY. YEA,

qe :

Smith also told me that the White House is as yet undecided
as to whether or not Mrs. Chennault is working for certain factions within _
\ the United States (presumably the Republican Party) or if she is actually

working for the Hanoi Government. He stated that the President frankly
believes that she is an activist with respect to peace negotiations and that
|: may very:well be that she is working for Hanoi. I again explained the

y

difficulties in instituting such a surveillance, however, told Smith we would
do what we could. Q)

After checking with the Director, I issued instructions to
Inspector Sizoo of the Domestic Intelligence Division that a loose survéillance
be maintained on Mrs. Chennault until it was determined what her usual daiiy
schedule would be; furthermore, that consideration would be given within the
next 24 hours as to whether or not the White House wanted to request that ay

—_
Messrs Willsey and Wright confided that the

Special Service Staff, although abolished in name, would
be gradually phased out and its functions, in part, absorbed
by other areas of IRS. It was confirmed that the special
arrangement regarding FBI dissemination to this special
group be terminated. It was proposed to the IRS officiais
that the FBI reinstitute the policy of disseminating
information of interest to IRS to the IRS {ntelligence
Division, the only exceptions being information of a
personnel nature which is furnished the IRS Inspection
Staff or information of an extremely sensitive nature which
is handled personally by the Liaison Agent with the :
Commissioner's Office, It was pointed out that this
procedure, which would create a central depository and
responsible agent within IRS for the internal distribution
of FBI information within IRS, would be consistent with

- preferred FBI procedures generally employed within the
Executive Branch.as well as FBI/IRS policy prior to the
August, 1969, special arrangement, Willsey concurred in
this procedure and instructed Olszewski to coordinate IRS
responsibility. Our Intelligence Division, which was the \
only division previously involved in the special dissemination
to the IRS Speciai Staff, is also implementing this procedure.

Concerning the types of information disseminated,
the INS officials concluded that pending IRS's evaluation,
dissemination to the Intelligence Division of IRS be restricted
to information coming to FBI's attention indicating possible
violations within IRS's jurisdiction undér the Internal Revenue
Code, This would be consistent with policy in effect prior
to the August, 1969, special arrangement. Willsey confided
that IRS plans to make a complete assessment of IRS's require=
ments for information in light of its current jurisdictional
responsibilities, The IRS officials agreed to apprise the
Liaison Agent of pertinent results of their findings to
Ansure preper coordination of any changes in dissemination
requirements.

Willsey also confided that the Commissioner was
receiving considerable pressure from.the staff of the
doint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation which Willsey
described as the IRS Congressional Oversight Committee.
Willsey explained that the Committee is currently interested
in the type of information collected by INS and has made
specific reference to the program which involved dissident
and extremist groups, Willsey said Committee members in
their review of I8S files apparently feel that they should
-be given access to FBI information contained in the files,
but that he, Willsey, has successfully rebuffed such efforts
to date, The Liaison Agent confirmed to Willsey that aecess 4
to FBI reports in XRS files to U. S. Legislative representatives :
would necessarily be precluded by Executive Branch policy i
as well as ‘the Third Agency Rule and FBI caveats which preciude
disclosure of the information outside the agency to which i
loaned. Willsey said he understood this and would stand on
this ground, Ue. suggested that should the pressure of the
Oversight Committee develop into some form of confrontation :
concerning the FBI information, he would immediately contact i
the FBI for advice and appropriate coordination,

z

ACTION:

For information, Liaison will follow with IRS
to insure proper coordination of FBI/IRS dissemination
procedures, Any IRS requests for information outside the
scope of normal dissemination procedures described above
Will be submitted with appropriate xecommendations to, the

On February 25, 1972, at 10:52 a.m., Tonne Radford called
Dixie (phonetic - not further identified). The conversation consisted
of small talk. -:-Near the end of the conversation Tonne said that she
does not know if "Chuck" will stay in the service. There was nothing
further pertinent during this conversation.

On February 26, 1972, at 10:45 a.m., Tonne Radford called
Karen (phonetic - believed to be Karen Parker whose husband, Jim,
works with Radford). During the conversation Tonne referred to a
Morman couple they had gone out to dinner with while the Radfords were
in Washington, D, C. She said their host had been part owner of the
restaurant where they ate and was "a member of the board." Tonne
subsequently identified this individual as Jack Anderson, the columnist.
Tonne said that she and her husband met Anderson's parents when the
parents came to India on a woridtour. She said that later while the
Radfords were stationed in Washington, D. C., the senior Andersons
visited their son, Jack, and invited the Radfords over to meet Jack.
She said this was the first time they had ever met Jack Anderson. Tonne
said that the Andersons were quite wealthy, have 9 children, and live in
a beautiful home.

During a conversation between Radford's wife, Tonne, and
an unidentified man named Miller at 4:27 PH on 1/5/72, mention
was made of an individual with a name which sounded phoretically
like Larry Manrang. The tape containing this conversation has
been carefully analyzed and it is now believed that this individual
is H, Laurence Manwaring, who is known to be active in the Mormon
Church. He resides at 514 North Oak Street, Falls Church, Virginia.
The current city directory shows that he lives at that address with
his wife, Bernice, and carries his occupation as retired.

Information available to us indicates that H. Laurence
Manwaring was Director, Seil Bank Division, Agricultural Stabili-
zation and Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.

It will bé noted that during the above~mentioned conversa-
tion, the person named Miller, which was not believed to be a last
name, made reference to a matter "which found its way to the floor
of Congress" and which caused a problem for Hiller during the time
he was with Benson. In this connection Mr. Ezra Taft Benson, a
Morman, was Secretary of Agriculture between 1953 and 1961.

The only significant information available concerning
Manwaring is that he was interviewed numerous times in 1962 during
the course of the probe of the Billie Sol Estes case concerning
various -individuals with whom he was acquainted, or other persons
who were also employed by Department of Agriculture.

RE: ROBERT T.” CARROLL

The following is -a-summary of information develope& concern-
ing Robert T,. Carroll on January 7, 8, and 9,-1972:

Numerous insigahficant calls were placed or received by two
individuals who are apparently Living or staying with Carroll. From
information developed during the various calls it appears that these
two individuals are James and Dan Martin. Dan Martin has been in.
contact with the Alexandria School Board, and based on prior data
noted, hd has apparently been trying to find employment as a school hall
monitor.

On 1/7/72 at 5:26 PM a Mr. Hammond talked to Dan Martin and. J.
asked for Nr. Carroll. Dan said thai Cavaoll left a message for
Hammond that Chuck Radford has been transferred and that someone else
will have te také-his Bunday school class. Hammond asked who is Hr.
Carroll and Dan said that he is a friend of Chuck. Hammond asked to
who he was speaking and the. answer was Dan Martin, Carroll's room-mate.
Hammond was amazed at the Radfords leaving so suddenly. In response
to the question, M&abin said that he did not know the reason for
Radford's transfer.a

On 1/7/72 in a conversation at 9:57 PM between "Jim" (thought

The following is, a summary of pertinent > information
developed concerning. Robert T, Carroll on January. 55 1972:

At 337 PM a Helen Hoyt talked to a mah named Dat"(last
name unknown) and asked for Bob Carroll. He was not.in and
Helés asked that Bob call her when he returns. ° aon

At 5:07 PM an unidentified woman, believed to possibly
be individual previously referred to as "Georgianna" in conversa-
tions hetween Carroll and Charles E. Radford II, talked to Carroll.

Bob informed her of Radford's transfer following Bob's advice for
him to "call the agent." Bob said the agent looked up the case ~
file and said, "you have no case here." The woman said that she
would like to believe that Radford is innocent of the major crime,
but if he is being punished for having lunch with a man named Jack
Anderson.... Bob said no, they had nothing, so the lawyer and
-Admiral Moorer got together, and they said to get him out of the
limelight, so they sent him to the West Coast, which is where he
wanted to go originally anyway. Bob said that the told Radford
the only thing he should get squared away is the deficiency mark
or whatever you call it.

The woman remarked that even if Radford wants the West Coast,
this still makes him look guilty. Bob agreed, but noted Anderson's
elaim that it was a top official. Bob said that what they want to
do is get him away from Anderson. Bob said that on top of all
that, Tonne Radford was supposed to go to the archives today with
Anderson's wife to look up the geneology of the family. Bob said
he told Tonne, “Are you crazy?"

: Bob mentioned that Radford had told him he came out bad on
the lie detector test. Tha woman asked if they are transferring
everybody. S8éBbsaid, "Well, they're kicked out of the White
House." But Bob didn't know if they are transferring everybody
that knows Anderson. The woman said that the transfer makes Radford
look guilty. The Woman said that it is terrible that someone gave
¢hose papers to Anderson, and that Anderson gave them to the Post
aadd that the Post published them. Bob said that Radford should
have taken his (Bob's) advice in the beginning. The woman agreed,
saying that if Anderson invited her to lunch .she would probably
refuse, she doean't like his nasty style. ane at

The unknown woman asked if this means you can't have
lunch with,a couple of thousand people, noting that she greets
Marvin Kalb in the hall every day, and conceivably he might
invite her to lunch one day. Bob said it might. boild down
to that. Bob then mentioned getting -a card from John Gotlepski
(phonetic), who is working up in Hackensack, New Jersey now,
They then discussed the unknown woman's back ailment and she asked
Bob to give Radford her best wishes. She also suggested that she
and Bob-might get together later in the week.

At 6:57 PM Helen Hoyt called Bob Carroll and said that

At 5:07 PM an unidentified woman, believed to possible
be individual previously referred to as "Georgianna" in conversa-
tions hetween Carroll and Charles E. Radford II, talked to Carroll.
Bob informed her of Radford's transfer following Bob's advice for
hin to "call the agent." Bob said the agent looked up the case
rile and said, “you have no case here.” The woman said that she
fl would like to believe that Radford is innocent of the major crime,
but if he is being punished for having lunch with a man named Jack
Anderson.... Bob said no, they had nothing, so the lawyer and
-Admiral Moorer got together, and they said to get him out of the
Limelight, so they sent him to the West Coast, which is where he
wanted to go originally anyway. Bob said that the told Radford
the only thing he should get squared away is the deficiency mark
or whatever you call it.
| The woman remarked that even if Radford wants the West Coast,
| “ this still makes him look guilty. Bob agreed, but noted Anderson's
claim that it was a top official. Bob said that what they want to
do is get him away from Anderson. Bob said that on top of all
that, Tonne Radford was supposed to go to the archives today with
Anderson's wife to lceok up the geneology of the family. Bob said
he told Tonne, “Are you crazy?"

Bob mentioned that Radford had told him he came out bad on
the lie detector test. ‘hw woman asked if they are transferring
everybody. 8éBbsaid, "Well, they're kicked out of the White
House." But Bob didn't know if they are transferring everybody
that knows Anderson. ‘The woman said that the transfer makes Radford
look guilty. The Woman said that it is terrible that someone gave
those papers to Anderson, and that Anderson gave them to the Post
anid that the Post published them. Bob said that Radford should
have taken his (Bob's) advice in the beginning. The woman agreed,
saying that if Anderson invited her to lunch .she would probably
refuse, she doean't like his nasty style. SREREEEEEEEE :

The following is” perti. nent information developed concerning
Charles E, hadsore IT on‘January 4, 1972:

At 10:26 AM Radford talked to a Chief Sessions (phonetic)
| and during the conversation Sessions asked if "the guy" saw Radford
the day before. Radford said yes and that this person identified
himself as being from Paul Carney's (phonetic) shop. Radford said
that this person picked up his DIA pass and building pass, and that
all he has left is his uniform. Sessions asked if anyone had talked
to Radford this week and Radford replied negatively. Radford said
that he read in the newspaper that the investigation is going on
and that he doesn't know where that came from. He said it sure is
a mess.

At 2:14 PM Radford called "Bob" (probably Robert T, Carroll,
previously identified) and engaged in a lengthy conversation. a
Radford wanted the telephone number of the Civil Liberties Union. >”
"Bob" said it is the American Civil Liberties Union, but that he
doesn't have the number. ‘ "Bob™ asked Radford if he is going to
contact the Civil Liberties Union or wait and Radford said that
he thinks he will contact them and see what they recommend, if

- they will recommend. Radford than told "Bob" that they took his
building pass and everything and "Bob" expressed the opinhon that
this is usual, Radford said he felt that they could at least
assign him to an unclassified job of some sort. "Bob" made the

statement, ¥Charies, you have to go back to work somewhere, T need
apace so =

a phone call.

Radford said that he was talking to Shertleff (phonetic) and
he said it really doesn't make any difference if you are guilty or-
not, they'll make a case-out of what they've got. "Bob" asked if
Radford had tried to talk to the Admiral. Radford said no, that
the Admiral would hardly mutter anything to him the first couple
of days. He said he is sure it is much worse now that he has
been kicked out of the White House. "Bob" said that the Admiral
could have been the leak,too. Radford said, "You're darn right !"
"Bob" suggested that perhaps they took away the Admiral's building
pass. Radford said no, that he is still working. He said that the
Chief is still working for thd Admiral, too, at the Pentagon; that
they have all been kicked out of the White House. "Bob" said it's

"Bob" said that all his people are retired, up in ONI,
and that hq doesn't know who to call to find out something.
Radford said he is going to phone these other "guys'(American
Civil Liberties Union ?) and:see if they will récommend something.
"Bob" cautioned that Radford cannot go too far with the case;
that he is under that code thing where he can't release stuff.
Radford seemed surprised and wanted to know if he is forced to go
through the Pentagon for a lawyer, “Bob" said he didn't think so
but that he would (recommend) that Radford go see the Pentagon
people first, the JAG office, and tell them what Radéord plans
to do, because it is jeopardizing his career, "Bob" repeated
that he would (recommend) that Radford go to the Pentagon JAG
first. He said tney are the ones who can get in touch with ONI
and find out what is going on, and then break it to the other
people (Civil Liberties Union ?). “Bob™ said that Radford would
have to be careful about what he told them, Radford said that
the whole thing is classified, and if he couldn't tell them about
that he wouldn't have anything to say. "Bob" again said that
Radford’ should go to the JAG first, and see what they have to say.

Discussion then took place concerning tests taken by Radford..

"Radford said that he was told that the results of the tests were

bad. "Bob" asked how the tests could be bad if Radford didn't

know anything. Radford said that he had been upset when he took

the test. "Bob" asked if only Radford's test showed up bad. Radford
said yes and that he doesn't ksow éf they are trying to pull a
sneaky on him or what.

Radford, at one point, said that he could at least be working
as a chaplain. "Bob" said that they may be investigating other
askpcts or something. Radford said that he is sure that's what they
are doing, but that "If the Admiral can continue working at his
same old position while they are investigating these other aspects,
why can't I?" "Bob" replied that he is m Admiral and trustworthy.
Radford inisted that he is just as trustworthy as an Admiral.
Radford said that they have a lot that makes it look like he-
(Radford) is not innocent, just by virtue of his movements. He said,
"I figure that's why I'm here, because the Admiral is still working
and he and I knew the same thing, the only difference is he didn’t

At another point in the conversation "Bob" said that the
lie detector thing was interesting, where they said that Radford
showed up bad. "Bob" asked what questions were asked. Radford
said they asked him if he gave material to Anderson, if he sold
material to Anderson, did he see Anderson, and things like that.
He said that they say I was lying to them. Following a discussion
as to the reliability of the polygraph operator, the following
verbatim conversation took place: "Bob" asked, "Did Anderson tell
you where he got the stuff ?" Radford, ina surprised tone of
voice, }} Huh?" “Bob" repeated, "Did Anderson tell you where he
got the"stuff ?" Radford replied, "No, I never asked him, I*m
having as little tontact with him as possible, believe me.

Anymore than is absolutely necessary is to much, for they can
always use that too, you know." "Bob" asked, "They still don't
know how you know Anderson ?" Radford replied, " I told them ?
They asked me. You know, it’s true, I do. But not ail that Beets
I know him and that's about the extent of it.

“Bob*® wondered if they published anythang after Radford
left the office that Radford did not see. Radford said that he
doesn't know, but that they made a remark that nothing had been
and this makes it just as bali, He said, "But on the other hand,
the guy that gave it to him, it scared the daylights out of him,
and he's not going to do anything until you know, I get hung,
or somebody gets hung, and he's-clear." Bob asked, "Wasn't there
one paper you told me that only you and the Admiral saw?" Radford
replied yes. "Bob" then said that somebody had to see that whenever
the Admiral took it someplace. Radford agreed. "Bob" indicated
that it could be somebody over at the White House.

At 3:44 Pil Radford talked te a Colonel Finklestein in
Admiral Moore's Office. He inquired as to procedures concerning
filing of formal charges and getting a lawyer. He said that he
has a problem; that they are accusing him of bigger secrets than
he thought they were.

aut - REQUESTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE

You will recall that in connection with the leak of
highly classified and extremely sensitive White House documents
to Jack Anderson, the White House requested that we institute
epectal electronic survettlance coverage of the prime suspect,
Charles, E,~Radford, II, a Navy enlisted man who had access to the
documents and was personally acquainted with Jack Anderson.

The White House subsequently requested that we also fen

institute coverage of Robert Tf. Carroll and Georgianna M, Prince,

iS 5 beth of whom were ucquatntances of Radford and possibiy: knowleage-
able concerning Radford's relationship with Anderson, Although
some significant information was developed initially from the
coverage of Carroll, particularly coneerning Radford's plans to-
posstbly contact the American Civil Liberties Unton concerning
the manner in whteh Defense Department (or White House) investi-
gators had interrogated him on a lte detector.

Radford was subsequently transferred to Portland, Oregon,
. however, and the coverage on Carroll and Prince has been mostly
negative in recent days. On 2/17/72, Mr. David Young, of Mr.
Jonn D, Ehrlichman's Office at the White House, advised that
the coverage of Robert T, Carroll and Georgianna M, Prinee should
be removed due to lack of productivity, He requested that the
coverage me are maintaining at Portland and Salem, Oregon be
continued, however, You will recall that we maintain coverage
of Willtam Frank Morgan, Portland, Oregon, Radford's..stepfather,
and on Radford himaelf at his residence and place of employment
in Salem, ae

Aceordingly, the coverage on Carroll and Prince was ordered
discontinued immediately and Washington Field Office advised that
tt was discontinued at 9:45 AM on this date.

had been tn contact with a Soviet Embassy offietat or employee.

The White House requested coverage of Carroll and we are
still monttoring his phone.

Carroll, tn conversations with Radford, kept referring to
_ @ woman named Georgianna. According to Carroll, Georgtanna
advocated that Radford should not have submitted to polygraph
examtnatton, and should get an attorney to protect his rights.
The White House subsequently indicated that the person referred

TO THE DIRECTOR:
Q UNE
RE: CHARLES EDWARD RADFORD IL
148 CLAGETT, SOUTHWEST
WASHINGTON, D. C.

On 12-22-71 Attorney General Mitchell personally instructed .
me to institute, after clearing with you, telephone surveillance of captioned
individual, telephone number 561-8384.

Mr. Mitchell said that this instruction came directly from
President Nixon. Mitchell called attention to the Jack Anderson column
of Tuesday, December 14, 1971, wherein disclosures were made of
conversations between the President and Henry Kissinger and between
Kissinger and other high officials at the White House and the State
Department. Mitchell said they believed Radford was the leak to
Anderson of this information. He explained that both Radford and
Anderson are members of the same church and that their respective
wives are closely associated in church work. According to Mitchell
Radford is a Navy Yeoman ist Class assigned to the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and responsible for frequent contact with the White House and
the National Security Council.

Mitchell advised that the President was gravely concerned

, over this matter and was anxious to ascertain the full extent of the security

*. breach, He said that no prosecution was contemplated. He inquired as to

whether I felt physical surveillance would be productive. I indicated that
while it might be productive it might also be very dangerous because if
Radford became aware of the same and furnished this information to
Anderson even more damaging columns could result. The Attorney
General agreed.

The Attorney General requested to be advised on a day-to-day
basis of developments in this case. .-I advised him that reports would be
made directly to him and that the matter would be handled on a strict —
"need-to-know" basis in the Bureau.

After clearing with you, I instructed Miller to personally contact
SAC Kunkel of the Washington Field Office and instruct that the desired
coverage be instituted as quickly as possible. I instructed Miller and told’
him to instruct Kunkel that the number of individuals. having access to this

matier be limited on a strict 'need-to-know" basis. I told Miller that
summaries prepared for the Attorney General should be blind and no
tickler copies should be made. One yellow copy should be made for
personal retention by me under maximum security in my office.

were closely associated in church work. Radford was responsible for
frequent contact with the White House and the National Security Council.

It was later determined that Radford had been brought to. Washington by
Admiral Moorer, and he was in a position to be privy and have access to

the type of data being leaked. He had previously worked for Admiral Moorer.

. It was also subsequently learned unofficially that Radford had
already been confronted by Navy investigators concerning the leaks and
had, as a matter of fact, already been given polygraph tests concerning
the leaks and his association with Jack Anderson. The FBI was not

. Fequested to conduct any investigation of the leaks; only to place electronic

coverage on Radford.

Mr. Mitchell told Mr. Felt that the President was gravely
concerned over this matter and was anxious to ascertain the full extent
of the security breach. He said that no prosecution was contemplated.
Mr. Mitchell inquired as to whether Mr. Felt believed physical surveil-

_ lance might be productive and Mr. Felt replied that it might be productive,
i but also might be very dangerous because if Radford became aware of the

same and furnished this information to Jack Anderson even more damaging
columns could result. Mr. Mitchell agreed. .

The Attorney General requested to be advised on a day-to-
day basis of developments in this case. Mr. Felt told Mr. Mitchell that
reports would be made directly to him and that the matter would be
handled on a strict "need-to~know" basis in the Bureau. a

After clearing with Mr. Hoover, Mr. Felt instructed you to
personally contact the SAC, WFO, and instruct that the coverage be
instituted as quickly as possible. You were also told to instruct the SAC,
WFO, that the number of individuals having access to this matter be
limited on a strict "need-to-know" basis. Mr. Felt instructed that

summaries prepared for the Attorney General should be blind and no

personal retention of Mr. Felt under maximum security in his office.’
These instructions were modified shortly thereafter so that the original “

, blind memorandum was sent to the White House in a sealed envelope .

addressed to "Honorable John D. Ehrlichman - Eyes Only." A copy was
prepared for the Attorney General, and a yellow file copy for Mr. Felt's
retention. ©

Only one copy of the logs were prepared by WFO and these
were. delivered on a daily basis in a sealed envelope to you marked in
such a manner that it would be opened only by you. Ne recora was
maintained of the installation by WFO. Only the SAC, Robert Kunkel,
and Coordinating Security Supervisor, Courtland J. Jones, were fully
knowledgeable in WFO concerning the coverage. I was the only one in
the Intelligence Division besides yourself who knew of the coverage. I
reviewed the logs and prepared the summaries, and I always hand-
carried them to Mr. Felt, the Director's Office, the Attorney General's

. ‘Office and handed the sealed envelope over to the Liaison Agent for
delivery to the White House. On two or three occasions, I personally

delivered the sealed envelopes to the White House and turned them over

to David Young, who was on Mr. Ehrlichman's staff. As.a matter of ©
record, these envelopes were delivered to Young's office by the Liaison
Agent. We know for a fact that Young was reviewing the summaries and
he personally informed us that he furnished the summaries to Ehrlichman.

Electronic surveillance coverage was instifuted on Radford's
residence on 12/23/71. In line with the policy which was in effect at
the time, a leased line letter was prepared for delivery to. the C & P
Telephone Company, and this letter was signed by Mr. Hoover.

It was quickly determined that Radford was in fact in touch
with Jack Anderson. On 12/23/71, Radford called the Anderson
residence to turn down a Christmas day dinner invitation. Radford's
wife, Tonne, on 12/24/71 told an acquaintance that they Were not going _
out to where they had been invited; that this was the main problem }
why they /(the Radfords) got into trouble. : x

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Charles Edward Radford II
Sensitive Coverage for the White House
COVE - Espionage

—

The coverage on Radford resulted in determination that
Radford was very close to a Robert T. Carroll, and that he freely
discussed the leak of information with Carroll. It was determined
from Bureau files that Robert T. Carroll was probably identical to
Robert T. Carroll, who had been assigned to the Defense Attache's
Office in New Dehli, India, and had been contacted by Soviet Attache,
Valentin I. Ilyintsev, 7/26/68. This information was reported to the
White House and the Attorney General.

- On 1/4/72, the Attorney General called Mr. Felt and said
that the matter involving Radford would be coming to a head in the next
two or three days and that he (Mr. Mitchell) felt that tne foiiowing 46
hours would be particularly critical. He called attention to the fact that
Radford had been in extensive conversations with Robert T. Carroll;
that Carroll had offered advice to Radford and had pumped him for
information. Among other things Carroll suggested that Radford go to
the American Civil Liberties Union to obtain a lawyer. The Attorney General

_Tequested that a telephone surveillance of Carroll be instituted as quickly

as possible on his residence. Dissemination was to be handled the same,
on a strict need-to-know basis. After clearing with Mr. Hoover, Mr. Felt
instructed you to take the necessary steps to obtain this coverage promptly
and to exercise the same security in effect with Radford.

On 1/11/72, the Attorney General called Mr. Felt with
further reference to the matter of the leak of confidential White House
memoranda to columnist Jack Anderson. Mr. Mitchell said that this
matter was far from being resolved and indications were then that other
persons may be involved. He said that Radford was still a prime suspect.
idford was presently en route to his new duty station at Portland, Oregon,
id he would be staying temporarily with his stepfather, William Frank "
organ. The Attorney General requested that a telephone surveillance
of Radford at his temporary location at the Morgan home be instituted as

-quickly as possible. He requested that results be promptly furnished

daily to him and to Mr. John D. Ehrlichman at the White House. Upon
Mr. Hoover's,approval, Mr. Felt instructed you to obtain the coverage
promptly and to exercise the same security precautions as before.

In reviewing logs of conversations of Robert T. Carroll,
Carroll, in conversation with Radford, kept referring to a woman named
Georgianna. Georgianna told Carroll that Radford should not have
submitted to a polygraph examination and should get a lawyer to protect
his rights. David Young at the White House subsequently advised that the
Georgianna referred to was probably Georgianna M. Prince, a fairly
high-ranking State Department official. Our files revealed that one
Georgianna M. Prince had served in severai U. S. Embassies abroad
and at one time was of interest to the Czechoslovakian Intelligence Service,
which was attempting to ascertain where Prince was residing in Virginia. -
David Young requested that coverage be placed on Georgianna M. Prince,
and he indicated that the request came from John D. Ehrlichman with the
concurrence of the Attorney General. Coverage on Prince was instituted

is/72.

Coverage of Radford in Portland, Oregon, was productive in
that it established that the Radfords were still in contact with Jack Anderson,
although the conversations were innocuous in nature. Ina conversation
between Mr. Morgan and her daughter in Portland, she revealed that one
of the first things Radford did upon arrival in Portland was to call Jack
Anderson and let him know where he was.

Radford was then transferred permanently to the Naval Reserve
Training Center at Salem, Oregon, and David Young requested that we
institute electronic surveillance (witetap) coverage of Radford both at his
place of employment and his residence. Young assured us that the Attorney
General concurred. In order to effect coverage at the Naval Reserve Training
Center , ‘it was necessary to place coverage on three separate lines going
into the Naval Reserve Training Center. However, no calis were monitored”

which were obviously not directed to or from Radford. Even so, a large
volume of traffic was handled.: Coverage was instituted on the Naval
Reserve Training Center lines 2/4/72, although no calls were-monitored
until opening of business on 2/7/72 when Radford was-scheduled to report
for duty. Coverage was instituted on hie residence of Charles Edward
Radford II on 2/18/72.

_ On 2/17/72, David Young advised that coverage of Robert T.
Carroll and Georgianna M. Prince should be removed because of lack of
productivity, but that the coverage maintained at both Portland and Salem,
Oregon, be continued. Accordingly, the coverage on Carroll and Prince
was removed on 2/17/72.

Subsequently, at the request of David Young at the White
House, coverage on the Naval Reserve Training Center in Salem, Oregon,
and on William Frank Morgan, Radford's stepfather in Portland, Oregon,
was discontinued 4/11/72. The coverage on Radford's residence continued,
however. The coverage on Radford was finally discontinued on 6/20/72,
following the Supreme Court decision in the Keith case. It was not
discontinued on 6/19/72, as others falling under the Keith rule had been,
since we were awaiting a decision from the White House.

Although we felt at the time that the Radford case fell within
the meaning of the Keith rule, and so stated to the White House at the time,
a reexamination of the facts surrounding the coverage relating to leaks such
as those involved in the Radford coverage has resulted in a conclusion that
this coverage would not have been affected by the Keith decision, inasmuch
as such coverage was in furtherance of efforts by the President to protect
national security information, which function was excepted in the Keith
decision.

It is to be noted that in connection with wiretaps placed in
this instance, no written authority was ever obtained from the Attorney General.
The initial request came from the Attorney General in personal instructions

Re: Charles Edward Radford IL

to Mr. Felt. Each was then approved by Mr. Hoover. Reports prepared
from review of the logs were delivered to the Attorney General as well as
the White House, so there was no question at any time that the Attorney
General was not aware of the coverage. Propriety of the coverage was
never in doubt at any time. It was unquestionably related to the national
security, and the necessity for maintaining the fewest possible records
relating to the coverage was obvious. This was the reason why no letter
was sent to the Attorney General requesting and getting individual written
approvals. This was the reason the coverage was reported by blind
memorandum on unwatermarked bond paper. This was the reason the
records were retained under heavy security in Mr. Felt's Office. This
was the reason that only a very few persons were privy to the coverage.”
The possibility of our coverage being leaked to Jack Anderson was very
real and very great. At the time, some of the Bureau's tightly held matters
were appearing in public print and the need for secrecy was apparent.

It is to be noted that following John N. Mitchell's resignation
as Attorney General, no further reports relating to the coverage were
delivered to the Attorney General's Office. Mr. Felt inquired of Attorney

* General Kleindienst if he desired to continue to get the reports and he
replied in effect that he did not know anything about the coverage and did
not want any reports relating to it.

Insofar as other records maintained, there were no records in
the electronic indices. However, Mr. Hoover instructed that the number
of wiretaps be included in the overall number of wiretaps which was a part
of his testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee, and a part of
the total number which had a definite ceiling. In other words when the total
number of wiretaps permitted by Mr. Hoover at any given time included one
of the Radford wiretaps, other national security taps were reduced by this
number.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

Bear Mr. Hoover: : SEnaeR
Thank you very much for your letter of Juiy 17, 1964. _
I have been giving this racial problem constant thought. Paren~
thetically, I did what I could yesterday in New York to get Pa
office moving faster and more ef tfectively in this mattered, / Lp
LAE

You asked for suggestions and this is what I ndéw offer
you for whatever little value it has.

(i) After writing you I recomnended to the
Inspection Division that a study be made
relative to whether or not the Domestic
queues Intelligence Division can better handle

oa ~ certain aspects of the Civil Rights-Racial
a probiem, Mr. Gale is very much in favor

‘ of this inquiry and is moving promptly in
be this matter. I think the results of his
inguiry will be most helpful in evaluating
the situation.

(2) What 7 have in mind basically is this: .
You may want to, in light of his inquiry, a i
consider transferring the responsibility
fov the development of informants in the
‘Klu Klux Klan White Citizens Council and
related "hate" organizations to the Bene
while leaving the responsibility for
investigating | bombings, killings, and so
forth where it now is. My idea is; This
Division can bring to bear all the techniques, —
skilis, and procedures which it has used‘ 'n-
to successfully penetrate the Communist Party .
and espionage organizations to now penetrate
these hate organizations causing us So much
trouble. (in talking to Mr. Tolson this te
eit i mentioned this briefly to him.)

(si/aty idea is operational ly sound, and if this
is Gone, I would immediately hold some
regional conferences in areas where the _
racial issue is acute and get under way in
these offices, spe scald and aggressive \ :
vvograms to carry‘out this jhigh Level ng halt
informant development - tely

Ww
al

right when you say that informant develop~ .
ment of the right kind is essentially the
solution to our current problem, The number
of informants per se as we both know, are of
no significance. What we must have is the
right kind of informants on the right level.
The old saying “The proof of the pudding is
in the eating” is relevant hers because if
we had this kind of informant penetration,

we wouldn't have some of these unsolved cases now
causing us so much concern, This is simply a
hard, stubborn fact we cannot theorize away.

(4) Further, we should expand our informant
penetration to cover some of these legitimate

The Domestié Intelligence Division will assume the responsibility
for formulating and carrying out disruptive counterintelligence
programs against such organizations.

The Domestic Intelligence Division, in addition’, is willing to go
beyond the recommendations approved by the Director related to
the above and will, with Bureau approval, develop highly placed,
quality informants in certain legitimate organizations whose
activities generally relate to racial matters, such as

National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP)

Congress of Racial Hquality (CORE)
Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee (SNCC)
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) - headed
by Martin Luther King
.

White Citizens Council

(Zach one, of course, will be handled on a carefully selected
basis and the action approved individually by the Bureau. )

V. Similarly, the Domestic Intelligence Division is willing to go beyond

LNW 55131 DocTd:32989632 Page 798 _

what was originally approved and will, with Bureau authorization,
proceed to establish informants and sources in Negro communities
throughout the Nation for the purpose of developing intelligence
information relating to the degree of racial tension; the possibility

of violence erupting inthe form of riots, etc. ; and will disseminate
this material to all interested persons inside and outside the Bureau.

The organizations and objectives as set forth in paragraphs IV and V
above are being made the subject of a separate memorandum inasmueh
as this involves a matter of policy and will have to be acted on
separately subject to approval by the Director.

1l- Mr. McGowan

Certainly, the items mentioned by Mr. Sullivan’are
such as to be handled by the Bureau on an intelligence basis. The
racial field is a most fertile field for Communist Party and other
subversive groups. There are indications of this such as in the
cases of Martin Luther King and Michael Schwerner, one of the
missing civil rights workers from Philadelphia, Mississippi, and
other situations. Also there are reports of foreign funds being used
to support the current actions of Malcolm X. The racial strife and
disorder are of such major significance as to have international
aspects and this is tailor-made for the disruptive tactics of subversive
elements both right and left.

We cannot afford to divorce the national racial program from
its possible international aspects. The devices and tactics presently
in use in the security field should be utilized to the fullest in
developing intelligence information regarding national as well as
international developments in the racial strife. The tense racial
potential in major cities is a fertile field for subversive activities
both right and left,

We have seen from the killings in the South, for example, y
the killing of Medgar Evers, that such appear to be isolated incidents a
usually carried out by one man or a small unattached group occurring
on the spur-of-the-moment, such as the killing of the Lieutenant Colonel
near Colbert, Georgia, and the assaulting of a minister in the streets ,

in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Pee ELL (REC-S" ater 4 ae oo

Gas

The investigation of the Klan and hate groups as well as catthel iil
development of informants in such organizations must, out ofondeésail
be handled as a whole. The following of the informants cannot be isolated a
from the over-all investigation of the organizations just as thé informants
in the Communist Party cannot be isolated from the organizations they are

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
RE: RACIAL MATTERS

Of course, any specific offenses such as, for example,
the case of the three missing civil rights workers in Philadelphia,
Mississippi, ‘or cases involving brutality, bombings or any other
violations these individual investigations should be handled by the
appropriate substantive desks such as the Civil Rights Desk.

The over-all racial field is specifically an intelligence operation
for the Bureau. It can best be organized when all facets are followed
and directed by one Division. The communist potential for activities
in this field would seem to be a major factor as evidenced by the doings
of Martin Luther King and his associates. The Bureau can best keep
abreast of the whole field by having all angles of the racial field united
in one Division utilizing the tactics which Mr. Sullivan has suggested
as being effective.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Personnel Transfers to Effect Proposed
Reassignment of Supervisory Responsibilities
in Racial Matters and Racial Informants

SA F. H. Freund has responsibility for Klan organizations for all
field divisions and supervises other classifications for ll western and
midwestern offices. .

SAL. A. Giovanetti has alternate responsibility for Klan organizations
for all field divisions and supervises other classifications for Atlanta,
Little Rock, Savannah and 4 other midwestern offices. ,

SAC. A. Parkis-has responsibility for other hate organizations (8
currently active) for all field divisions and supervises other classifications
for Birmifigham, Mobile, Cleveland and the 4 Texas offices.

SA F. P. Smith supervises classifications (other than racial informants
and organizations) for New Orleans, Memphis, Knoxville and 7 western
offices, and special cases.

SA H. E. Trent supervises classifications (other than racial informants
and Organizations) for Charlotte, Savannah, Baltimore, Washington Field
office, Louisville and 2 midwestern offices.

Based on the distribution of work, Inspector's. analysis reflects that it would
take 5 of the 7 men assigned to the Organizations Ynit to handle racial matters and
racial informants under the approved change of responsibilities. There are 7 clerical
employees assigned to the Organizations Unit of the Civil Rights Section and it is
felt that 5 of these clerical employees who generally handle the work being transferred
from the General Investigative Division to the Done stic Intelligence Division be
transferred along with the supervisors. Assistant Directors Rosen and Sullivan are
in accord that the proposed personnel changes are equitable, consistent and correspond
with the transfer of responsibilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS :
1. That Supervisor in Charge Joseph C. Trainor and Agent Supervisors
Deegan, Freund, Giovanetti and Parkis be transferred to Division 5 (Domestic Intelligence

Division) concomitant to the transfer to that Division of spervisory responsibility over
racial matters and racial informants (if approved to be handled by Mr. Mohr's Office).
