Although completely unrelated in any way to prior requests

of the White House for electronic surveillance coverage of White House

aides and newsmen from 1969 - 1971 in connection with leaks of highly

classified national security information, captioned matter also related to

electronic surveillance coverage of individuals at the specific request of

the White House. Because'of the very sensitive nature of the matter, it is

being given a code word "COVE", Espionage" and all records and documents

relating to the matter will be kept in the Associate Director's Office with

access limited to those persuns wi have received prior individual epproval

from the Director, Associate Director or the Assistant Director in charge of

the Intelligence Division. Although index cards will be maintained in the

general indices of the Bureau, and index cards will be filed in the Special

Electronic Surveillance indices, no abstracts will be prepared except in

correspondence to and from the field and memoranda dated from this date

The genesis of this matter is as follows: On 12/22/71, the

Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, personally contacted Mr. W. Mark Felt,

who was then the Deputy Associate Director, and instructed him to

institute, after clegring with Mr. Hoover, a telephone surveillance of MCl-3l

a Navy reoman Ist Class assigned to the Joint

Chieis of Staff. Mr. Mitchell said that this instruction fame directly from

It was later determined that

worked for Admiral Moorer. (6)

It was also subsequently learned unofticially that

had, as a matter of fact, already been given polygraph tests concerning .

the leaks and his association with Jack Anderson. The FBI was not

Mr. Mitchell told Mr. Felt that the President was gravely

concerned over this matter and was anxious to ascertain the full extent

of the security breach. He said that no prosecution was contemplated.

'Mr. Mitchell inquired as to whether Mr. Felt believed physical surveil-

, lance might be productive and Mr. Felt replied that it might be productive,

but also might be very dangerous because if

became aware of the

same and furnished this information to Jack Anderson even more damaging

columns could result. Mr. Mitchell agreed. (C)

The Attorney General requested to be advised on a day-to-

day basis of developments in this case. Mr. Felt told Mr. Mitchell that,

reports would be made directly to him and that the matter would be

handled on a strict "need-to-know" basis in the Bureau.

After clearing with Mr. Hoover, Mr. Felt instructed you to

personally contact the SAC, WFO, and instruct that the coverage be

instituted as quickly as possible. You were also told to instruct the SAC,

WFO, that the number of individuals having access to this matter be

Subsequently, at the request of David Young at the White

House, coverage on the Naval Reserve Training Center in Salem, Oregon,

however. The coverage on

following the Supreme Court decision in the Keith case. It was not

discontinued on 6/19/72, as others falling under the Keith yule had been,

since we were awaiting a decision from the White House.

Although we felt at the time that the

case fell within

the meaning of the Keith rule, and so stated to the White House at the time,

a reexamination of the facts surrounding the coverage relating to leaks such

this coverage would not have been affected by the Keith decision, inasmuch

as such coverage was in furtherance of efforts by the President to protect

national security information, which function was excepted in the Keith

decision. (c)

to Mir. Felt. Each was then approved by Mr. Hoover. Reports prepared

from review of the logs were delivered to the Attorney General as well as

the White House, so there was no question at any time that the Attorney

General was not aware of the coverage. Propriety of the coverage was

never in doubt at any time. It was unquestionably related to the national

security, and the necessity for maintaining the fewest possible records

relating to the coverage was obvious.

This was the reason why no letter

was sent to the Attorney General requesting and getting individual written

approvals. This was the reason the coverage was reported by blind

memorandum on unwatermarked bond paper. This was the reason the

records were retained under heavy security in Mr. Felt's Office. This

was the reason that only a very few persons were privy to the coverage.

The possibility of our coverage being leaked to Jack Anderson was very

real and very great. At the time, some of the Bureau's tightly held matters

were appearing in public print and the need for secrecy was apparent. (C)

It is to be noted that following John N. Mitchell's resignation

as Attorney General, no further reports relating to the coverage were

delivered to the Attorney General's Office. Mr. Felt inquired of Attorney

• General Kleindienst if he desired to continue to get the reports and he

replied in effect that he did not know anything about the coverage and did

not want any reports relating to it.

Insofar as other records maintained, there were no records in

the electronic indices. However, Mr. Hoover instructed that the number

of wiretaps be included in the overall number of wiretaps which was a part

of his testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee, and a part of

the total number which had a definite ceiling. In other words when the total

number of wiretaps permitted by Mr. Hoover at any given time included one

of the

" wiretaps, other national security taps were reduced by this

number.

between Mr. Morgan and her daughter in Portland, she revealed that one

of the first thing's Radford did upon arrival in Portland was to call Jack

Anderson and let him know where he was. (e)

Radford was then transferred permanently to the Naval Reserve

Training Center at Salem, Oregon, and David Young requested that we

institute electronic surveillance (wiretap) coverage of Radford both at his

place of employment and his residence. Young assured us that the Attorney

General concurred. In order to effect coverage at the Naval Reserve Training

Center, it was necessary to place coverage on three separate lines going

into the Naval Reserve Training Center. However, no calls were monitored

which were obviously not directed to or from Radford. Even so, a large

volume of traffic was handled. Coverage was instituted on the Naval

Reserve Training Center lines 2/4/72, although no calls were monitored

until opening of business on 2/7/72 when Radford was'scheduled to report

for duty. Coverage was instituted on the residence of Charles Edward

Radford Il on 2/15/72. (c)

On 2/17/72, David Young advised that coverage of Robert T.

Carroll and Georgianna M. Prince should be removed because of lack of

productivity, but that the coverage maintained at both Portland and Salem,

Oregon, be continued. Accordingly, the coverage on Carroll and Prince

was removed on 2/17/72. (C)

Subsequently, at the request of David Young at the White

House, coverage on the Naval Reserve Training Center in Salem, Oregon,

and on William Frank Morgan, Radford's stepfather in Portland, Oregon,

was discontinued 4/11/72. The coverage on Radford's residence continued,

however. The coverage on Radford was finally discontinued on 6/20/72,

following the Supreme Court decision in the Keith case. It was not

discontinued on 6/19/72, as others falling under the Keith rule had been,

since we were awaiting a decision from the White House.

(c)

Although we felt at the time that the Radford case fell within

the meaning of the Keith rule, and so stated to the White House at the time,

a reexamination of the facts surrounding the coverage relating to leaks such

as those involved in the Radford coverage has resulted in a conclusion that

this coverage would not have been affected by the Keith decision, inasmuch

as such coverage was in furtherance of efforts by the President to protect

national security information, which function was excepted in the Keith

decision.

(C)

It is to be noted that in connection with wiretaps placed in

this instance, no written authority was ever obtained from the Attorney General.

The initial request came from the Attorney General in personal instructions

to Mr. Felt. Each was then approved by Mr. Hoover. Reports prepared

from review of the logs were delivered to the Attorney General as well as

the White House, so there was no question at any time that the Attorney

General was not aware of the coverage. Propriety of the coverage was

never in doubt at any time. It was unquestionably related to the national

security, and the necessity for maintaining the fewest possible records

relating to the coverage was obvious. This was the reason why no letter

was sent to the Attorney General requesting and getting individual written

approvals. This was the reason the coverage was reported by blind

memorandum on unwatermarked bond paper. This was the reason the

records were retained under heavy security in Mr. Felt's Office. This

was the reason that only a very few persons were privy to the coverage.

The possibility of our coverage being leaked to Jack Anderson was very

real and very great. At the time, some of the Bureau's tightly held matters

were appearing in public print and the need for secrecy was apparent. tO,

It is to be noted that following John N. Mitchell's resignation

as Attorney General, no further reports relating to the coverage were

• delivered to the Attorney General's Office. Mr. Felt inquired of Attorney

General Kleindienst if he desired to continue to get the reports and he

replied in effect that he did not know anything about the coverage and did

not want any reports relating to it.

Insofar as other records maintained, there were no records in

the electronic indices. However, Mr. Hoover instructed that the number

of wiretaps be included in the overall number of wiretaps which was a part

of his testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee, and a part of

the total number which had a definite ceiling. In other words when the total

number of wiretaps permitted by Mr. Hoover at any given time included one

of the Radiord wirets, other national security taps were reduced by this

It was previously reported that teach-ins and other

actions are to be held throughout the U.S. this week to

protest pollution and to educate individuals on the causes

of environmental pollution.

The idea for this activity is

atributed to Senator Gaylord Nelson (D.-Wisc.). The main

activities are to be held on 4/22/70 throughout the U.s.

invironmental ACtion was Iormed at lashington, v. c..

to

sert organize and coordinate the activities on 4/22/70, which

has been designated "Earth Day."

We have surveyed our field offices to determine

activities planned on 4/22/70 and to determine whether

militant groups will participate.

We have determined that

activities will be held in at least 33 states and the

I District of Columbia.

The highlights of this activity are as follows:

'At Boulder, Col., a teach-in will be held at the

University of Colorado.

Groups sponsoring this teach-in

have agreed to support the Student Mobilization Committee to

End the War in Vietnam (SMC), which is controlled by the

Young socialist Alliance, In its demands that the heserve

Officers Training Corps (KOre) be eliminated Irom the campus,

that the University end research for the Government, and that

students be given control of corporate recruiting on

the

campus.

At Hashington, D. C., the Washington Area Environmental

Coalition is sponsoring various demonstrations on 4/22/70.

by a march to the General Motors (GM) Corporation office to

present antipollution petitions to Gi officials. A teach-in

will also be held at L'Enfant Square.

This teach-in is

sponsored by the Earth Day Committee of the Department of

Health, Education and Welfare.

The American Federation of

Teachers is sponsoring a teach-in at the Lincoln Memorial on

the same day.

"The Mound Builders Gazette" has been established

to report on the environmental actions. Its editor is

Bill Hobbs, a former member of Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) at George Washington University, Washington, D. C.

At Chicago, Ill., environmental actions are

scheduled at 38 colleges and high schools.

At Boston, Mass., the New England Ecology Center

is sponsoring a rally at the Massachusets Institute of

Technology, Cambridge, Mass., followed by a rally at Kennedy

Plaza, Boston.

Following the rally, a funeral procession

will be held to Logan Airport.

The

funeral procession is to

commemorate victims of the war in Vietnam, racism, and

pollution.

The demonstrators will present coffins

to Pan

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Demo-

cratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into being

at a founding convention held at Port Huron, Michigan, in

June, 1962.

From an initial ideological posture of "parti-

cipatory democracy," the current line of the national leader-

ship reveals

an adherence to Marxism-Leninism. Michael

Klonsky, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the

building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement. The

program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights

struggles to an anti-Vietnam war position

and finally to its

present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking up the

oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America with

• the

black liberation movement

in the United States.

China,

Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which are leading.

the world-wide struggles against United States imperialism.

On the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as an imperi-

alist power and does not support the policies of that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608

West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official

paper

"New Left Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership

and program adopted at meetings of the National Council and

National Interim Committee (NIC). Three national officers

and a NIC of eleven members are elected each year during a

June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college

chapters elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein

program and ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter

1s autonomous in natur a.d is tree to cainy out independent

policy and programs reflective of local conditions.

APRIL 22, 1970

On April 6, 1970, Mr. Robert Waldrop, local

representative of the _Sierra_Club, 235 Massachusetts

Avenue, N.E., Washington, D. C. (iDC), made application

for the use of National Captiol Parks to "peacefully

petition the government for immediate action to preserve

the environment and to express citizen's concern for environ-

mental problems." Waldrop stated the request was being made

by the Washington Area Environmental Action Coalition for a

National Environmental Teach-In Day, April 22, 1970. He

requested the use of the Parklands Playing Fields at Consti-

tution Avenue and 21st Street, N.W., from 1:30 p.M. until

2;30 p.M., and the Sylvan Theatre on the Washington Monument

Grounds from 3:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.M.

Waldrop stated that the Washington Area Environ-

mental Action Coalition includes residents of the metro-

politan region, community groups, and students Irom Loca!

universities.

'We are closely coordinated with the nation-

wide Enviromental Teach-In sponsored by Senator (Gaylord)

Nelson and Representative (Paul N.) McCloskey, (JI.)."

The Sierra Club is a western based

conservation organization located

at 1050 Mills Tower, San Francisco,

California.

On April 14, 1970, "The Washington Post" newspaper;

• WDG, reported under the caption, "Area Students Mobilize For

Earth Day," that the dangers to the earth's environment, in-

cluding overpopulation, have been the concern of many in the

WDC area. Since February, 1970, a "movement" has gotten

under way made up of a coalition of students and conservation

organizations, with support coming largely from the white,

middle class.

April 22nd, "Earth Day" will climax with a

march to the Interior Department in the afternoon by students

and conservation organizations headed by representatives of

the Sierra Club.

On April 14, 1970, the Washington 'Area Environ-

mental Coalition held

a press conference at the Dupont Plaza

Hotel, WDC,

Robert Haldrop spoke for the coalition and,

"stated that "Farth' Day" activities on April 22nd, vere being

organized by the coalition which consists of interested stu-

dents from American University, Catholic University, Trinity

College, George Washington University, and Prince Georges

Community College, Maryland, working closely with the Emer-

gency Committee on the Transportation Crisis (ECTC). Environ-

mental Teach-Ins were planned for the respective campuses on

April 22, 1970.

It was announced that the Coalition would picket

the Washngton Hilton Hotel, 1919 Connecticut Avenue, N.o,

on April 21, 19/0, Where Secretary of Iransportation John A.

Volpe would

be speaking before the highway users conference.

Waldrop announced plans for April 22nd, saying that

the march past the Department of Interior would be "symbolic"

since the Department of Interior "has become the symbol of the

Government's envirormental insanity. The Nixon administration

has tried

to make the environment its issue.

The SDS is characterized in an ap-

pendix page attached hereto.

On April 21, 1970, representatives of the FBI observed

the following activities at

the Washington Hilton Hotel, from

about noon until 1:20 p.I. .

A group numbering about 60 persons picketed on the

sidewalk in front of the hotel. Literature passed out stated

the demonstration was called to coincide with the Tuesday

luncheon of the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mío-

bility at which Secretary Volpe was scheduled to speak. Picket

signs indicated the group represented the National Coalition

on the Transportation Crisis, ECTC, Student Committee on the

Transportation Crisis and Washington Area Environmental Coali-

tion.

Signs displayed accused the Federation of being a high-

way lobby, and "polluters and plunderers."

Sammie Abbott and Matt Andrea, previously mentioned,

were observed directing the pickets.

There was no incidents or arrests.

On April 22, 1970, "The Washington Post" published

an "Earth Day" schedule for

the Washington area which related

that a number of events were scheduled to be held at various

high schools and colleges in the area between 9 a.m. and 9:15

gram featuring folk singers and speakers was scheduled.

On April 22, 1970, representatives of the FBI

observed about 200 persons

on the Playing Fields shortly

after 1:30 p.M. They were joined a few minutes later

by a contingent of George Washington University students

who arrived chanting "Save Our Earth."

A brief speech followed by which an unidentified

GWU Law School student spoke out against Secretary of

the Interior Hickel, and the administrations of both Presi-

dents, Johnson and Nixon.

He said it was time for some

action regarding pollution..

About 2 p.m., the group, numbering about 750

persons, moved out in the direction of the Interior De-

partment. Some of the signs carried were! "Save Our Earth

- Concern, Inc.", "Save Our Seas; We Demand A Moratorium On

All Off Shore Drilling", and "End The Fascist Rape Of America."

Some persons wore paper surgical type masks and one had a gas

mask.

Shortly after 2 p.m., the crowd then estimated

to be eight to nine hundred persons, gathered on the Vir-

ginia Avenue side of the Department of Interior at 19th

and C Streets, N.W. An unidentified male read a "Declara-

tion of Independence"' and the crowd chanted, "'e want air,

we want water, we want Hickel."

About 2:30 p.m., the group at the Interior Depart-

ment left and joined another group gathered at the Sylvan

Theatre. The two groups totaled an estimated 2,500 or more.

A sign was noted which read, "God is Not Dead; He Is Polluted

On Earth." There were no speeches, but several musical groups

entertained the crowd until after 8 p.m.

Shortly after 8 p.m., Senator Edmund Muskie, (D) Maine,

Senator Muskie was followed by WDC journalist

I. E. Stone, who spoke for 20 minutes on the themes of

anti-pollution, anti-military and anti-administration.

Denishlays,

National Coordinator for Environmen-

tal Action, WIC,

; followed and gave a short anti-Vietnam war

and anti-pollution talk.

Phittochs

was the next speaker. He made a few

anti-administration remarks and then introduced

sente bavis, one of the convicted defendants in the Chicago

Conspiracy Trial. Davis spoke for approximately ten minutes.

Davis began bygsaying that the events he was

involved in in Chicago were not a conspiracy, but there

is one now, a capitalistic conspiracy and he called for

tearing down the capitalistic structure. He said that

people in "Agnew Country," meaning government officials

in Washington, believe the ecology. issue will divert the

attention of people in the United States from the Vietnam

war.

He said the movement knows its history and this tactic

will not work. He said The Conspiracy is joining forces with

such groups as Women's Liberation, the Black Liberation Strug-

gle and ecology forces to fight at every level of our society

to end the war in Vietnam.

At this point, Davis was interrupted by heckling

from someone in the audience.

He made an obscene remark

to the effect that any "pigs" in the audience should get

•out while they could.

He then said he opposed all pollution

except "light up a joint and get stoned." "One way to fight

for ecology is to go to New Haven on May Ist to stop Bobby

Seale's trial," referring to the trial there of the Black

Panther leader.

said that "tomorrow" would be the last day of his trial and

that the day after the verdict is given, the slogan will be,

"Sink the Navy."

• At 12:25 aoll., April 23, 1970, Pete-Seeger, the

folk singer, made a few remarks about ecology and cleaning

up society and the Potomac river. At this point, the power

was shut off.

Seeger and Reverend Frederick-Kirkpatrick, a

-Negro folk singer, sang a few songs through a bullhorn, and

the crowd began thinning rapidly. The program ended at 1 a illo,

with approximately 50 persons remaining behind to clean up the

area.

APPENDIX

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Demo-

cratic Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being

at a founding convention held June, 1962, at Port Huron, Mich-

igan. From an initial posture of "participatory democracy" the

line of the national leadershif has revealed a growing Marxist-

Teninist adherence which currently calls for the building of a

revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently, the program of

SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an anti-Vietnam

war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imperialist position.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders of worldwide

struggles against United States imperialism whereas the Soviet

Union is held to be revisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive

Labor Party (PLP) forces in the organization were expelled.

As

a result, the National Office (NO) grouf maintained its National

Headquarters at 1608 West Madison Street, Chicago, and the PLP

faction set up headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This

headquarters subsequently moved to Boston. Each grouf elected

•its own national officers, which include three national secre-

taries and a National Interim Committee of eight. Both the NO

forces and the PLP forces claim to be the true SDS. Both groups

also print their versions of "New Left Notes" which sets forth

the line and the program of the particular faction. . The NO

version of "New left Notes" was recently printed under the title

"The Fire Next Time" to achieve a broader mass appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within

the NO group, namely, the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth

Movement (RYM) I faction, and the RYM II faction. Weatherman

is action-oriented upholding Castro's position that the duty of

revolutionaries is to make revolution. Weatherman is regarded

by RYM II as an adventuristic, elitist faction which denies

the historical role of the working class as the base for revo-

lution. RYM II maintains that revolution, although desired, is

not possible under present conditions, hence emphasizes organizing

8

and raising the political consciousness of the working class

upon whom they feel successful revolution depends. Although

disclaiming control and domination by the Communist Party,

USA, leaders in these two factions have in the past proclaimed

themselves to be communists and to follow the precepts of a

Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along pro-Chinese conmunist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP faction

which is more connonly known as the Worker Student Alliance

is dominated and controlled by members of the PLi, who are

required to identify themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-

Leninist philosophy of the PLP.. They advocate that an al-

liance between workers and students is vital to the bringing

about of a revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters, although

operating under the outlines of the SDS National Constitution,

are autonomous in nature and free to carry out independent policy

reflective of local conditions. Because of this autonomy internal

struggles reflecting the major

factional interests of SDS have

occurred at

the chapter level since the beginning of the 1969-70

school year.

The PLP is characterized separately in the Appendix.

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY (PLP)

"The New York Times" city edition, Tuesday, April 20,

1965, page 27, reported that a new party of "revolutionary

socialism" was formally founded on April 18, 1965, under the

name of the PLP which had been known as the Progressive Labor

Movement.

According to the article, "The Progressive Labor

Movement was founded in 1962, by Milton Rosen and Mortimer

Scheer after they were expelled from the Communist Party of

the United States for assertedly following the Chinese Com-

munist line."

A source advised on June 3, 1968, that the PLP held

its Second National Convention in New York City, May 31 to

June 2, 1968, at which time the PLP reasserted its objective

of the establishment of a militant working class movement

based on Marxism-leninism. This is to be accomplished through

the Party's over-all revolutionary strategy of raising the

consciousness of the people and helping to provide ideological

leadership in the working class struggle for state power.

The source also advised that at the Second National

Convention Milton Rosen was unanimously re-elected National

Chairman of the PLP and Levi Laub, Fred Jerome, Jared Israel,

William Epton, Jacob Rosen, Jeffrey Gordon, and Walter Linder

were elected as the National Committee to lead the PLP until

the next convention.

The PLP publishes "Progressive Labor," a bimonthly

magazine; "World Revolution," a quarterly periodical; and

"Challenge-Desafio," a monthly newspaper.

The April, 1969, Issue of "Challenge-Desafio" sets

forth that "Challenge is dedicated to the peoples fight for

a new way of life--where the working men and women control

their own homes and factories; where they themselves make

up the entire government on every level and control the

schools, courts, police and all institutions which are now

used to control

them."

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON

MR. BISHOP

Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan called and advised

there was an urgent matter he wanted to take up with me by phone as

Mr. Richard Moore, Special Assistant to the Áttorney General, has

called Assistant Director Bishop and himself from the White House.

Mr. Moore was at that time over at the White House with Ronald Ziegler,

Press Secretary to the President. Mir. Mcore said they were going to go

to a press meeting around four o'clock and they wanted from us over the

telephone, & general statement to explain why we had a reason for covering

the National Environmental Action meeting that Senator Edraund S. Muskie

(D. -Itaine) is complaining about. Mr. Fullivan said a brief statement

has been worked out and proceeded to read as follows:

"Senatur Muskie has publicly condemned the FBI for having

concerned itself with Earth Day rallies heid throughout the United States

on April 22, 1970. He noted that no crime or threat of crime was invoived

nor was any violence threatened. Senator Muskie has deplored the fact that

the FBI issued confidential reports on this matter to other Government

agencies.

The Senator from slaine deciared there was no justitication for

any part of the Federal intelligence community observing and reporting

legitimate political events which do not affect our national security or

involve a potential for crime.

"It is most unforturate that after having come into possession

of FBI documents relating to this matter Senator Muskie did not take the

time to seels an answer to the questions he raised on the floor of the Senate.

Had Mr. Muskie voiced his concern to re, he would have found that almost

from the moment the Barth sallies were announced, reports were received

that militant action might tale place. There were reports of blocking major

Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson and Bishop

April 14,

1971

-

"The FBI's sole purpose in collecting and reporting information

regarding this matter was to determine the extent of efforts by extremist

elements to exploit or disrupt these activities for their own purposes. There

have been prior gatherings in Viashington of large numbersof people which

resulted in violence and considerable damage was done."

I told Mr. Sullivan I thought that was all right.

I said collateral to this, I had sent a note through to check out the

dissemination of that report and asked if that were Media and Mr. Sullivan

said it was not. I said I would surmise some agency in Washington gave this

out. Mr. Sullivan said it was disseminated to Secret Service and some other

agencies. I told him to run it down at every agency and ask to see their copy.

Mr. Sullivan said he would.

Nature of demonstrations. On April 22, 1970,

a number of rallies, teach-ins, and other events vere

held

throughout the United States.

These activitles were centered

to a considerable extent on college and high school campuses

throughout the countzy and one of the major demonstrations

yes held at Vashington, D. Co, under, the auspices of the

Washington Area Enviroonental Coalition.

Reason for fEI coverage.

Beginning in March.

1970, the FBI was in receipt of a nunter of reports and

allegations indicating

; that in some sastances, militant

activities would occur in connection with harth Daz". rallies.

Moreover, there were indications that nonbers of extremist

organizations such as the Students for a Democratic Society

would participate in the rallies and might engage in disruptive

activities.

The IBI's coverage of these events was ained at

determining nature and extent of involvcuent on the part of

subversive or extrenist elements.

Additionally, it is aoted

that on larch 23, 1970, the Eureau received a requeat from a

The Deputy Attorney General

It is noted that Senator Huskie's release presente

a highly slanted and misleading picture of this matter. The

following soints are noted in this connection:

(1) He rationalitos

his public release of an official

IBi document by first noting that it 1a not one of those 1bens

stolen Iron our Medis, Pennsylvania, Resident Agency, and that

1t contained no classified designation. While the letterheze

memorandum was not classified, it did contain the specifie

precautlonary staiement that it was the property of the fBi

and that it and its contonts are not to be distributed outside

of the recipient agency.

(2)

muskie asserted

that the rallies contained no

hint of violence,, lot, speaking on the sane platiorm with

Mustie was Rennie Davis whose earlier public utterances

resulted in his conviction on a charge of inciting to riot.

Muskie conpletely ignored the atatement nade by Davis in his

speech at the rally which "called for tearing down the

capitalist structure." Davis lurther stated that one way

to fight for ecology

would be to go to wen laven "to stop

Bobby Seale's trial," Davis's statement calling for the

destruction of the capitalist structure could hardly be

considered a point dealing with ecolosy and certainly,

• inplies nore than a "aint of violence."

(3)

Senator Huskie asserts that the menorandun in

question had been widoly circulated to the entire intelligence

connualty, and perhaps even to local police.

This not true.

The letterhead menorandua in question was dissominated to

the

three nilitary intelligence agencies, the Department,

and the secret service.

(4)

Sonator Huskie stated that the FBI report

•coupled an analysis of his activities it the "Farth Day"

Ially with a dissortation on

• the Students {or 1 Democratic

Society (son) and the Progzossive labor Peaty (PLa).

Cur

information containod in the letterhead monomandua did no

such thing. References to the sus and the Put were attroied

as an appendis to the document and offered a thumbnail sketch

on both organizations since each has moutioncd in the boug

of the docuiont.

the existence of the Center for the Administration of Justice

at American University, which Iurnishes courses in law.

enforcement and aaministration.

He was present at the "Free Bobby Seale and the

Panthers" rally on 5/1-2/70 at Yale University and stated

he planned to help organize aurally

at American University to

encourage a student strike on 5/4/70. He participated in the

rally on 5/4/70 where it was decided to block traffic to pro-

test the killing of Kent State University students.

During October, 1970, Eames learned FBI clerical

employees had withdrawn from a

course at American University

taught by Thomas Rose, a former Students For A Democratic

Society (SDS) leader at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.

Eames claimed FBI employees withdrew because of critical remarks

made by Rose concerning the Director and the FBI.

Eames

encouraged the American University Student Association to

organize student criticism of this withdrawal.

The WFO LHM also identified one Sammie Abbott as

having been present at the April 14, 1970, press conference.

The following data was contained in

Bureau files regarding Abbott.

The 7/7/51 issue of "The Washington Post" carried

an article regarding testimony before the House Committee on

Un-American Activities earlier that year by Mrs. Mary Stalcup

Markward, whom the article reported as an FBI undercover

agent among District of Columbia communists for 6 years. She

identified Abbott in her testimony as a member of the Communist

Party of Washington, D. C.

Mrs. Markward was a Bureau informant from the early

1910's until late 1949, during which time she held positions of

trust in the Communist

Party, Washington, D. C., as a Bureau

intormant, she identified Abbott to the Bureau

as a Communisi

Party member.

Abbott was also identified as a member of the

Communist Party as recently as 1958 by an informant of the

Bureau's Baltimore Office. Abbott is on the Security Index.

In introducing a resolution to establish a Joint Committee on

Individual Rights in the U.S. Congress, Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-Wisconsin)

called for an effort to bring the "Government's surveillance and snooping

powers under effective Congressional control and review immediately."

Senator Nelson made reference in the resolution to the FBI surveillance of the

Earth Day Rally in Washington, D. C., on 4/22/70.

The following facts regarding FBI activity on Earth Day are set

forth for the information of the Acting Director.

(100-45) /15-165, /62 )

Publicity regarding the FBI's interest in Earth Day, 1970, was

revealed on 4/14/71 when Senator Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) released an

FBI letterhead memorandum (LHM) which summarized the results of activity

in Washington, D. C., on 4/22/70 in connection with a nationwide ecology and

environmental program called Earth'Day. This LhM was prepared by our

Washington Field Office (WFO) under date of 6/10/70 and was an unclassified

document which was disseminated by WFO to FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) and the

Alexandria and Baltimore Divisions. At FBIHQ dissemination was made to

Secret Service, the Department of Justice and three military intelligence

agencies. We were unable to determine how Senator Muskie received a copy

of the above LHM.

SI-111 REC-39/+0-445-7774-

WFO's coverage of the rally was prompted by instructions from

FBIHQ. In this regard, it is pointed out that on 3/23/70 a representative of

the White House (Jack Caulfield) contacted the Bureau and advised that

Mr. Ehrlichman at the White House was interested in any information the Bureau

could secure regarding the involvement of radical groups in the ecology move-

ment. On 3/27/70 we directed a communication to all FBI field offices calling

Re: Earth Day Rally, 1970

attention to the upcoming Earth Day activities and instructing that established

sources be alerted and close liaison be maintained with appropriate agencies

to insure that we developed relevant information concerning subversive or

violence-prone persons participating in these activities.

A total of 50 field offices reported information of one kind or

another concerning the Earth Day events. They involved a total of 57 separate

rallies or functions. In the great majority of instances no violence was reported

although 13 individuals were arrested at a Boston demonstration and in the

Florida area a group of persons tried to leave garbage near the President's

home in Key Biscayne. In three instances, activities on the part of subversive

elements were reported.

In the Washington, D. C., rally in addition to Senator Muskie,

the speakers included three individuals of security interest; namely, I. F.

Stone, Phil Ochs, and Rennie Davis. Stone had been identified as a Communist

Party, USA, member in the 1930s and was publisher of "I. F. Stone's Weekly,"

an independent newsletter. He consistently espoused the interests of the Communist

Party front groups. Ochs had stated previously that he considered himself a

communist although he was not a Communist Party member. Ochs was involved in

antiwar demonstrations and had been arrested in Chicago in 1968 because of his

participation in a street incident during the Democratic National Convention:

Davis held various leadership positions in the militant Students for a Democratic

Society in the mid-1960s and had long opposed the Vietnam war. He was convicted

for violating the Antiriot Law and for conspiracy in connection with his activity.

in the Democratic National Convention in 1968. His conviction was later

overturned.

Stone, Ochs and Davis spoke against pollution, the Vietnam war

and the Nixon Administration. Davis, whose remarks included obscene

comments, called for the tearing down of the capitalistic structure and for

support of Black Panther Party (BPP) leader Bobby Seale in connection with Seale's

trial on a charge of murder relating to the torture killing of a BPP member.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Earth Day Rally, 1970

Individuals also of security interest with subversive backgrounds

were active in Earth Day events at Salt Lake City, Utah, and Tempe, Arizona.

Pertinent information developed by the FBI regarding Earth Day activity

throughout the country was furnished to the White House, the Attorney General,

the Secret Service and the three military intelligence agencies.

FBI coverage of Earth Day activities was aimed strictly at identifying

involvement of subversive or violence-prone elements. To a degree, at least,

our coverage was prompted by the prior expression of White House interest in

learning the extent of the radical participation in the ecology movement. In addition,

the subversive or violence-prone elements at that time are known to capitalize

on events sponsored by legitimate nonviolent and dissenting organizations by con-

ducting disruptive acts, by distributing literature or

by collecting funds at those

events.

Our coverage of Earth Day events was confined almost entirely to

the collection of information available through established sources (although in

four instances, including the Washington, D. C., rally, Bureau personnel did

• cover the activities) and no open inquiries were conducted.

Senator Nelson has apparently referred to our coverage of the

Earth Day Rally in order to garner support for his resolution calling for a Joint

Committee on Individual Rights.

Bromley Smith called me back at 10:35 a.m. and indicated

he had talked with the AG concerning this matter.

The AG at first

questioned the fact that Smith had called him on a White House direct

line, rather than coming over personally.

Smith stated he told the

AG that time was running out and the White House did not have time t

come over to the AG's office.

The AG replied that Dick Helms of

CIA usually came over on a personal basis.

Smith stated he had explained to the AG why the wire-tap

was needed

immediately. The AG replied he thought a wire-tap had

been placed on the South Vietnamese Embassy last week.

Smith told

him that, according to the FBI, this was not true. The AG stated

that, in view of the urgency of the situation, there appeared to be

no problem, but this was a rather unusual way of handling the matter.

The AG next told Smith that he would await a call from the FBI.

A memorandum requesting the AG's approval, in writing, has been

prepared and is being sent through.

For record purposes, at President Lyndon B. Johnson's speci..

Vice Presidential candidate Spiro Agnew on the date of November 2, 1968,

atz

the time he was in Albuquerque.

SAC Jordan called back 11/13/68 and reported that Governor Agnew's

campaign American Airlines charter plane arrived in Albuquerque at 11:44

a.m., November 2, 1968. It departed at 2:10 p.m. for Harlingen, Texas.

There were three phones placed on his plane at the time of arrival. Numbers

of these telephones were 247-1448, 247-1449 and 247-1440. The last two

mentioned phones were never used.. There were five phone calls either made

from or charged to the first listed number. Three of these calls were

specifically made from this phone while two were made from a pay station at

the airport near this phone.

At 11:59 a.m., Governor Agnew personally made a call to Washington,

D. C., area code 202, 737-5600, to Secretary of State Dean Rusk. The call

(lasted approximately three minutes 1806465-64069-

The second call was made at 12:16 p.m. by staff member Kent Crane

from a pay phone, 299-9920, which was chargeable to the above listed first

to a Mr. Cal

Purdy.

M8 DEC 4 1968

At 3:10 p.m. a third call was made by the same

Kent Crane: to

New York City from the same pay phone and chargeable to the first listed phone

on the plane.. The call to New York was made to area code 212, 288-8444

This call lasted approximately nine minutes and forty seconds. (Investigation

by the New York Office has subsequently shown that this telephone number is a

listed number and the subscriber is Bruce Friedle, a sculptor, 304 East 75th

Street, New York City. He has the entire floor and has had service there

prior to 1966. Mr. Friedle also has an outside extension to this phone at

1349 First

lasted for one minute and 51 seconds and this phone is chargeable to Maurice

Stans, at the said Nixon-Agnew Campaign Headquarters.

SAC Jordan reported that there had been no toll calls from

Albuquerque to the South Vietnamese Embassy, Washington, D. C., or none

to the telephone number of Mrs. Claire Chennault, Washington, D. C. He

also reported that in the event there had been credit card calls from

Albuquerque to Washington, D. C., it would be impossible to trace these

calls in Albuquerque inasmuch as all such charges are routed to Baltimore,

Maryland, for administrative handling. (The Baltimore Office has not been

instructed to check these later possibilities. It takes approximately thirty

days for them to be coordinated.)

The above information was furnished telephonically to the Director

on 11/13/68.

President Lyndon B. Johnson called at approximately 4:00 p.m.,

11/13/68, and asked concerning progress regarding the above matter. He

was given, the spectic detalls as enumerated above on a verbatim basis.

He instructed that a check be made to determine if the fifth call to a Mr. Hitt

at Nixon-Agnew Campaign Headquarters could possibly have been made to

Mrs. "Chennault. He stated he understood that we were physically surveilling

Mrs. Chennault at the time and therefore a record should have been made of

her whereabouts so that a determination could be made concerning whether

she was at Nixon-Agnew Headquarters at the time (1:02 p.m., 11/2/68).

I told him this would be done. He also asked that Washington, D. C.

toll calls be checked to ascertain if there had been any phone calls from

Mrs. Chennault or the South Vietnamese Embassy to New Mexico, Texas,

or Los Angeles on the date of November 2, 1968.

At 3:00 p.m. on 11/15/681 called Jim Jones, Special Assistant to

the President, and indicated that our surveillance on Mrs. Chennault as of

11/2/68 reflected that she remained at home until approximately 1:30 p.m.

that date at which time she departed for Baltimore, Maryland.

For record purposes, at President Lyndon B. Johnson's speei

(frequest, SAC Jordan, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was instructed on 11/12,

to have a careful check made of all outgoing phone calls made by the then

| Vice Presidential candidate Spiro Agnew on the date of November 2, 1968,

at;

the time he was in Albuquerque.

SAC Jordan called back 11/13/68 and reported that Governor Agnew's

campaign American Airlines charter plane arrived in Albuquerque at 11:44

a.m., November 2, 1968. It departed at 2:10 p.m. for Harlingen, Texas.

There were three phones placed on his plane at the time of arrival. Numbers

of these telephones were 247-1448, 247-1449 and 247-1440. The last two

mentioned phones were never used.. There were five phone calls either made

from or charged to the first listed number. Three of these calls were

specifically made from this phone while two were made from a pay station at

the airport near this phone.

At 11:59 a.m., Governor Agnew personally made a call to Washington,

D. C., area code 202, 737-5600, to Secretary of State Dean Rusk. The call

lasted approximately three minutes /E-6445 sinti-ll

listed number and the subscriber is Bruce Friedle, a sculptor, 304 East 76th

Street, New York City. He has the entire floor and has had service there

prior to 1966. Mr. Friedle also has an outside extension to this phone at

Bromley Smith called from the White House at 5:50 p.m.

He stated that the President had just called him and had indicated that

i

the information furnished by the FBI today in the captioned case was

extremely significant. According to Smith, the President ordered that

the FBI begin an immediate surveillance of Mrs. Claire Chennault so that

it can be determined every place she went and every person she met with -

in the next several days.

TO REG40 65-62098-171

I told Smith that the obtaining of complete intelligence in

such an assignment would be almost an impossibility in view of the fact

that Mrs. Chennault lived at the Watergate here in Washington and was

constantly involved in social activities. I stated that furthermore it was

widely known that she was involved in Republican political circles and, if

it became known that the FBI was surveilling her this would put us in a

mostuntenable and embarrassing position.

Smith said he recognized this

fact, however, the President had given him a direct order and he was

I passing it on to us.

Smith also told me that the White House is as yet undecided

as to whether or not Mrs. Chennault is working for certain factions within

the United States (presumably the Republican Party) or if she is actually

working for the Hanoi Government.

He stated that the President frankly

believes that she is an activist with respect to peace negotiations and that

it may very well be that she is working for Hanoi. I again explained the

difficulties in instituting such a surveillance, however, told Smith we would

do what we could.

After checking with the Director, I issued instructions to

Inspector Sizoo of the Domestic Intelligence Division that a loose surveillance

be maintained on Virs. Chennault until it was determined what her usual daily

schedule would be; iurthermore, that consideration would be given within the

next 2i cours as to whether or not the White House wanted to request that a

wiretag de placed on this woman.

Messrs Willsey and Wright confided that the

procedure, which would create a central depository and

résponsible agent within IRS for the internal distribution

of FBi information within IRS, would be consistent with

preferred IBI procedures generally employed within the

Exocutive Branch as well as IBI/IRS policy prior to the

August, 1969, special arrangement.

Willsey concurred in

this procedure and instructed Olszewski to coordinate InS

responsibility. Our Intelligence Division, which was the

only division previously involved in the special dissemination

to the IRS Speciai Stail, 18 also implementing this procedure.

Concerning the types of iniormation disseminated,

the InS officials concluded that pending IRS's evaluation,

dissemination to the intelligence Division of lis Do restricted

no into rence

to infornation coming to FBI's attention indicating possible

violations within IRS's jurisdiction under the Internal Revenue

Code.

This would be consistent with policy in effect prior

Willsey confided

that IRS plans to make a complete assessment of IRs's require

responsibilities.

The IRs offictals agreed to apprise the

Menorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re:

Internal Revenue Service

Department of the Treasury

Dissemination Procedures

Willsey also confided that the Commissioner was

receiving considerable pressure from the stail of the

Joint Comnittee on Internal Revenue Taxation which Willsey

described as the IRS Congressional Oversight Committee.

Willsey explained that the Comnittee is currently interested

in the type of information collected by IRS and has made

speciiic reference to the program which involved dissident

and extremist gioups.

Willsey said Committee members in

their review of Ils files apparently feel that they should

• be given access to iBI Information contained in the files,

but that he, willsey, has successfully rebuiied such efforts

to date.

The Liaison Agent confirmed to Willoey that ascess

to IBI reports in IRS files to U.S. Legislative representatives

would necessarily be precluded by Executive Brauch policy

as well as the third

Agency hule and FBI caveats which preclude

disclosure of the information outside the agency to which

loaned.

Willsey said he understood this and would stand on

this ground. le suggosted that should the pressure of the

Oversight Countieo develop into some form of confrontation

concerning the FbI information, he would innediately contact

the rBs for advice and appropriate coordination.

ACTION:

For information.

Liaison will follow with IRS

to insure proper coordination of FBI/IRS dissemination

procedures.

Any Ins requests for information outside the

scope of normal dissemination procedures descrived above

will be submitted with appropriate recommendations to the

Director or approval.

These

meetings stemmed from IRS Conmissioner Donald Alexander'g

decision apparently related to mounting Congressional and

news media pressure following public disclosures of

Re:

Dissemination Procedures

of information concerning predominantly extremist and

dissident groups and their officials for the purpose of

intiating IRS field investigations and audits looking

toward possible detection of tus law violations.

Based

upon a formal request iron this, we agreed, with the

Director's approval, to disseminate reports concerning

such groups to the iRs special staire

IRS specifically

identified approximately 75 groups, which included blacs

extremist, white hate, klan, communist, New Loit, Trotskyist

and, in general, the wide range of groups directly or

indirectly involvod in dissiant activities at the time:

Although this concentrated pangzan substantially broadened

our previous scope of dissemination to IRS, it was responsive

to an official IRS request and did sere to implement

Investigative and intelligence commity interests at the

time in dealing & blow to dissident groupã.

On several

occasions, IRS indicated to mu the extreme value of such

information in uncovering vlointions of the tax lavs and

exempt status of these groups.

The IRS Special Stair, &irot zeceived publle

attention following disclosues of its function by

disgruntle tan increased based on claim

disgruntled, former FEI Agant Robert Wall in early 1972.

Since that tine, Congressionni. and nersmedia pressures

have gradually increased based on clains that it was

discrininatory for IRS to single out such groups for tax

liability evaluation. In the light of recent publicity,

we became more selective in our dissemination to the IRS

Special Staff and with the Cosmissioner's announcement

discontinued the special dissemination completely in absence

of some specific information indicating possible violations

within IRS's jurisdiction

Re:

Internal Revenue Service

Department of the Treasury

-Dissemination Procedures

Messrs Willsey and Wright confided that the

Special Service Staff, although abolished in name, Fould

be gradually phased out and its functiong, in part, absorbed

by other areas of IRS. It was confimed that the special

arrangement regarding FBI dissemination to this special

group be terminated.

It was proposed to the IRS officials

that the ibs reinstitute the policy or disseminating

information of interest to IRS to the IRS Intelligence

Division, the only exceptions being information of a

personnel natura which is furnished the IRS Inspection

Stats or iniormation of an extremely sensitive nature which

is handled personally by the Liaison Agent with the

Commissioner's Office.

It was pointed out that this

procedure, which would create a central depository and

responsible agent within IRS for the internal distribution

ot FBi information within ins, would be consistent with

preserred FBI procedures generally employed within the

Executive Branch as well as IBI/IRS policy prior to the

August, 1969, special arrangement.

Willsey concurred in

this procedure and instructed Olszewski to coordinate IRS

responsibility. Our Intelligence Division, which was the

only division previously involved in the special dissemination

to the IRS Special Staff, 1s also implementing this procedure.

Concerning the types of information disseminated,

the InS officials concluded that pending IRS's evaluation,

dissemination to the Intelligence Division or IRS be restricted

to information coning to FBI's attention indicating possible

violations within IRS's jurisdiction under the Internal Revenue

Code. This would be consistent with policy in effect prior

to the August, 1969, special arrangemant.

Willsey confided

that IRS plans to make a complete assessment of IRS's require-

ments for information in light of its current jurisdictional

responsibilities. The IRS officials agreed to apprise the

Liaison Agent of pertinent results of their findings to

insure proper coordination of any changes in dissemination

reguirements.

Dissemination Procedures

Willsey also confided that the Commissioner was

receiving considerable pressure from the staff of the

Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation which Willsey

described as the IRS Congressional Oversight Committee.

Willsey explained that the Committee is currently interested

In the type of information collected by IRS and has made

specific reference to the program which involved dissident

and extremist groups.

Willsey said Committee membors in

their review of Ins files apparently feel that they should

be given access to FBI information contained in the files,

but that he, Willsey, has successfully rebuffed such efforts

to date. The Liaison Agent confirmed to Willcey that access

to FBI reports in IRS files to U. S. Legislative representatives

would necessarily be precluded by Executive Brauch policy

as vers as the Inird Agency hule and ful caveats which preclude

aisclosure of the InIormation outside the agency to which

Loaned. Willsey said he understood this and would stand on

this ground.

He suggosted that should the pressure of the

Oversight Comnittee develop into sone form of confrontation

concerning the FBI Information, he would innediately contact

the FBI for advice and appropriate coordination.

ACTION:

For Information,

Liaison will follow with IRS

to insure proper coordination of FBI/IRS dissemination

procedures.

Any IRS requests for information outside the

scope of normal dissemination procedures described above

will be submitted vith appropriate recommendations to the

Director for approval.

It is anticipated that

coverage will be re-instituted early on 2/11/72..

As result of coverage of Willian Frank Morgan, Portland,

Oregon, it was determined that radford did not report for duty on

2/10/72, since he was given the day off because his household goods

arrived and he needed to help move into his new house. Radford and.

his wife, Tonne, indicated they would travel to Portland on the

evening of 2/10/73 to pick up some perishable grocizies which the

Morgans have been keeping in their refrigerator.

The only other significant information developed from the

Mrs. Morgan if tonne was there.

She was told that the radfords haa

returned to salem.

The woman asked if tonne could be reached by

At 10:21 AM Radfora called Barbara Tabor at Doneywill

Motors (phonetic) in California and said that the loan applica-

At 10:26 AM Tonne Radford called her mother and described

their new house. She said that the peraon with whom Chuck Radford

will work in the commander's office is a Mormon.

She said Chuck

if he needs it.:

Tonne told her mother they will not get a phone right away

in salem unless they are required to do so by the lavy Office.

At 11:24 Al Radford called Walston and Compuny Brokerage

House in Portland and asked for a quotation on Dover Corporation

and Pacific South Hest Airlines. He then asked if he could sell

without certificates in his possession, stating that they are in

a shipment which will not arrive for two weeks. He was told that

he cannot sedl the stock without the certificates. He was asked

if he wanted to open an account with Malaton and he replied that

he has had an account for several years.

At 6:10 PM Barbara labor called Radford and said that the

money he needs for. the house is in the mail.

A discussion then

followed concerning on article in the paper relating to Jack

Anderson. This discussion is set out verbatim.

to Radford's

wife, Tonne.

"Bob" asked if "they" didn't call and Tonne replied,

"No! Nothing." Tonne said

Radford would have to tell "Bob" about it...."At your place."

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON

RE: SPECIAL ELECIRONIC SURVEILLANCE

REQUESTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE

You will recall that in connection with the leak of

highly classified and extremely sensitive White House documents

to Jack anderson, the wnute House requested that we unstutute

specral electronic surveillance coverage of the prime suspect;

Charles. E. Radford II, a Navy enlisted man who had access to the

documents and was personally acquainted with Jack Anderson.

The White House subsequently requested that we also

institute coverage of Robert I. Carroll and Georgianna M. Prince,

soil of whom were ucquaintances of Radford and possibly knowledge-

able concerning Radford's relationship with Anderson. Although

some significant information was developed initially

coverage of caroli, particularly doneering Radfords plan to

possibly contact the American Civil Liberties Union concerning

the manner in which Defense Department (or White House) investi-

gators had interrogated him on a lie detector.

Radford was subsequently transferred to Portland, Oregon,

however, and the coverage on Carroll and Prince has been mostly

negative in recent days.

on 2/17/72, Mr. David Young, of Mr.

John D. Ehrlichman's Office at the White House, advised that

the coverage of Robert I. Carroll and Georgianna M. Prince should

be removed due to lack of productivity. He requested that the

coverage we are maintaining at Portland and salem, Oregon be

continued,

however.

You will recall that we maintain coverage

of william Erank Morgan, Portland,

oregon, Radford's stepfather,

and on Radford himself at his residence and place of employment

in salem.

Accordingly, the coverage on Carroll and Prince was ordered

discontinued immediately and Washington Field Office advised that

it was discontinued at 9:45 AM on this date.

I will keep you fully of all developments in this case.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON

RE: SPECIAL ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

COVERAGE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

LEAKS TO JACK ANDERSON

You will recall that just prior to Christmas we unstituted

electronic surveillance coverage of Charles E. Radford II, a Navy

Yeoman who was assigned to Admiral Moorer's Office at the White

House.

It developed that Radford had been examined on a polygraph

and it was detected that he had been in contact with Jack Anderson

and, according to the polygraph examiner, hadi guilty knowledge of

material being leaked to Anderson.

As result of coverage of Radford, tuo predominant names

Fem

emerged showing an unusual amount of interest in the investiga-

ion beingarroleted by Defende Department of Radford.

One was

Robert I.

•, who called radora frequently and discusse

in some detai, Radford's association with Jack Anderson and the

investigation being conducted. Our files indicated that Carroll

was at one time assigned to the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, and

had been in contact with a soviet Embassy official or employee.

The White House requested coverage of Carroll and we are

still monitoring his phone.

Carroll, in conversations with Radford,

kept referring to

a woman named Georgianna.

According to Carroll,

• Georgianna

advocated that Radford should not have submitted to polygraph

examination, and should get an attorney to protect his rights.

The White House subsequently indreated that the person referred

to as Georgianna was probably Georgianna M. Prince, a fairly high.

ranking state Department Official.

Our files indicate that one

Georgianna M. Prince had served in several U.S. Embassies abroad

and at one time was of interest to the Czechoslovakian Intelligence

Service, which was attempting to ascertain where Prince was

residing in virginia.

The White House requested coverage of Prince and we are

still monitoring her phone.

RE: CHARLES E. RADFORD II

At 12:30 p.m., 1-11-72, Attorney General Mitchell called

with further reference to the matter of the leak of confidential White

House memoranda to columnist Jack Anderson.

Mitchell said that this matter is far from resolved and

Radford is still a prime suspect. Radford is presently en route to his

new duty station at Portland, Oregon, where he will be staying, at

least temporarily, with his step-father, Mr. William Frank Morgan,

The Attorney General requested that telephonic surveillance

of Radford at his temporary location at the Morgan home be instituted

as quickly as possible. He requested that results be promptly furnished

daily to him and to Mr. John Ehrlichman at the White House.

It the Director approves, I will instruct Miller to take

the necessary steps to obtain this coverage promptly and to exercise

TO THE DIRECTOR:

RE: CHARLES EDWARD RADFORD II

JUNE

148 CLAGETT, SOUTHWEST

WASHINGTON, D. C.

On 12-22-71 Attorney General Mitchell personally instructed

me to institute, after clearing with you, telephone surveillance of captioned

individual, telephone number 561-8384.

Mr. Mitchell said that this instruction came directly from

President Nixon. Mitchell called attention to the Jack Anderson column

of Tuesday, December 14, 1971, wherein disclosures were made of

conversations between the President and Henry Kissinger and between

Kissinger and other high officials at the White House and the State

Department. Mitchell said they believed Radford was the leak to

Anderson of this information. He explained that both Radford and

Anderson are members of the same church and that their respective

wives are closely associated in church work. According to Mitchell

Radford is a Navy Yeoman 1st Class assigned to the Joint Chiefs of

Staff and responsible for frequent contact with the White House and

the National Security Council.

Mitchell advised that the President was gravely concerned

, over this matter and was anxious to ascertain the full extent of the security

breach. He said that no prosecution was contemplated. He inquired as to

whether 1 felt physical surveillance would be productive. I indicated that

while it might be productive it might also be very dangerous because if

Radford became aware of the same and furnished this information to

Anderson even more damaging columns could result. The Attorney

General agreed.

The Attorney General requested to be advised on a day-to-day

basis of developments in this case. . I advised him that reports would be

made directly to him and that the matter would be handled on a strict

"need-to-know" basis in the Bureau.

After clearing with you, I instructed Miller to personally contact

SAC Kunkel of the Washington Field Office and instruct that the desired

coverage be instituted as quickly as possible. I instructed Miller and told

matter be limited on a strict "need-to-know" basis. I told Miller that

summaries prepared for the Attorney General should be blind and no

tickler copies should be made. One yellow copy should be made for

personal retention by me under maximum security in my office.

Attached is a copy of the Jack Anderson column for Tuesday;

12-14-71.

Although completely unrelated in any way to prior requests

of the Whìte House for electronic surveillance coverage of White House

aides and newsmen from 1969 - 1971 in connection with leaks of highly

classified national security intormation, captioned matter also related to

electronic surveillance coverage of individuals at the specific request of

the White House. Because of the very sensitive nature of the matter, it is

being given a code word "COVE". Espionage" and all records and documents

relating to the matter will be képt in the Associate Director's Office with

access limited to inose persuns who have received prior individual approval

from the Director, Associate Director or the Assistant Director in charge of

the Intelligence Division. Although index cards will be maintained in the

who was then the Deputy Associate Director, and instructed him to i

institute, after clearing with Mr. Hoover, a telephone surveillance of MCT-31

were closely associated in church work. Radford was responsible for

frequent contact with the White House and the National Security Council.

It was later determined that Radford had been brought to Washington by

Admiral Moorer, and he was in a position to be privy and have access to

the type of data being leaked. He had previously worked for Admiral Moorer.

It was also subsequently learned unofficially that Radford had

already been confronted by Navy investigators concerning the leaks and

had, as a matter of fact, already been given polygraph tests concerning

the leaks and his association with Jack Anderson. The FBI was not

requested to conduct any investigation of the leaks; only to place electronic

coverage on Radford.

Mr. Mitchell told Mr. Felt that the President was gravely

concerned over this matter and was anxious to ascertain the full extent

of the security breach. He said that no prosecution was contemplated.

Mr. Mitchell inquired as to whether Mr. Felt believed physical surveil-

, lance might be productive and Mr. Felt replied that it might be productive,

but also might be very dangerous because if Radford became aware of the

same and furnished this information to Jack Anderson even more damaging

columns could result. Mr. Mitchell agreed.

The Attorney General requested to be advised on a day-to-

day basis of developments in this case. Mr. Felt told Mr. Mitchell that

reports would be made directly to him and that the matter would be

handled on a strict "need-to-know." basis in the Bureau.

After clearing with Mr. Hoover, Mr. Felt instructed you to

personally contact the SAC, WFO, and instruct that the coverage be

instituted as quickly as possible. You were also told to instruct the SAC,

WFO, that the number of individuals having access to this matter be

limited on a strict "need-to-know" basis. Mr. Felt instructed that

personal retention of Mr. Felt under maximum security in his office.

These instructions were modified shortly thereafter so that the original

, blind memorandum was sent to the White House in a sealed envelope.

addressed to "Honorable John D. Ehrlichman - Eyes Only." A copy was

prepared for the Attorney General, and a yellow file copy for Mr. Felt's

retention.

Only one copy of the logs were prepared by WFO and these

were delivered on a daily basis in a sealed envelope to you marked in

such a manner that it wouid be opened only by you. He recoru was

maintained of the installation by WFO. Only the SAC, Robert Kunkel,

and Coordinating Security Supervisor, Courtland J. Jones, were fully

knowledgeable in WFO concerning the coverage. I was the only one in

the Intelligence Division besides yourself who knew of the coverage. I

reviewed the logs and prepared the summaries, and I always hand-

carried them to Mr. Felt, the Director's Office, the Attorney General's

Office and handed the sealed envelope over to the Liaison Agent for

delivery to the White House. On two or three occasions, I personally

delivered the sealed envelopes to the White House and turned them over

to David Young, who was on Mr. Ehrlichman's staff. As a matter of

record, these envelopes were delivered to Young's office by the Liaison

Agent. We know for a fact that Young was reviewing the summaries and

he personally informed us that he furnished the summaries to Ehrlichman.

Electronic surveillance coverage was instituted on Radford's

residence on 12/23/71. In line with the policy which was in effect at

the time, a leased line letter was prepared for delivery to the C & P

Telephone Company, and this letter was signed by Mr. Hoover.

It was quickly determined that Radford was in fact in touch

with Jack Anderson. On 12/23/71, Radford called the Anderson

residence to turn down a Christmas day dinner invitation. Radford's

wife, Tonne, on 12/24/71 told an acquaintance that they were not going

out to where they had been invited; that this was the main problem

why they (the Radfords) got into trouble.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: Charles Edward Radford lI

Sensitive Coverage for the White House

COVE - Espionage

The coverage on Radford resulted in determination that

Radford was yery close to a Robert T. Carroll, and that he freely

discussed the leak of information with Carroll. It was determined

from Bureau files that Robert I. Carroll was probably identical to

Robert T. Carroll, who had been assigned to the Defense Attache's

Office in New Dehli, India, and had been contacted by Soviet Attache,

Valentin I. Ilyintsev, 7/26/68. This information was reported to the

White House and the Attorney General.

• On 1/4/72, the Attorney General called Mr. Felt and said

that the matter involving Radford would be coming to a head in the next

two or three days and that he (Mr. Mitchell) feit that tne folowing 48

hours would be particularly critical. He called attention to the fact that

Radford had been in extensive conversations with Robert T. Carroll;

that Carroll had offered advice to Radford and had pumped him for

information. Among other things Carroll suggested that Radford go to

the American Civil Liberties Union to obtain a lawyer. The Attorney General

requested that a telephone surveillance of Carroll be instituted as quickly

as possible on his residence. Dissemination was to be handled the same,

on a strict need-to-know basis. After clearing with Mr. Hoover, Mr. Felt

instructed you to take the necessary steps to obtain this coverage promptly

and to exercise the same security in effect with Radford.

On 1/11/72, the Attorney General called Mr. Felt with

further reference to the matter of the leak of confidential White House

memoranda to columnist Jack Anderson. Mr. Mitchell said that this

matter was far from being resolved and indications were then that other

persons may be involved. He said that Radford was still a prime suspect.

Radford was presently en route to his new duty station at Portland Oregon,

and he would be staying temporarily with his stepfather, William Frank

Morgan. The Attorney General requested that a telephone surveillance

of Radford at his temporary location at the Morgan home be instituted as

quickly as possible. He requested that results be promptly furnished

daily to him and to Mr. John D. Ehrlichman at the White House. Upon

Mr. Hoover's,approval, Mr. Felt instructed you to obtain the coverage

promptly and to exercise the same security precautions as before.

In reviewing logs of conversations of Robert T. Carroll,

Carroll, in conversation with Radford, kept referring to a woman named

Georgianna. Georgianna told Carroll that Radford should not have

submitted to a polygraph examination and should get a lawyer to protect

his rights. David Young at the White House subsequently advised that the

Georgianna referred to was probably Georgianna M. Prince, a fairly

high-ranking State Department official. Our files revealed that one

Georgianna M. Prince had served in several Ü. S. Empassies auruau

and at one time was of interest to the Czechoslovakian Intelligence Service,

which was attempting to ascertain where Prince was residing in Virginia.

David Young requested that coverage be placed on Georgianna M. Prince,

and he indicated that the request came from John D. Ehrlichman with the

concurrence of the Attorney General. Coverage on Prince was instituted

1/14/72.

Coverage of Radford in Portland, Oregon, was productive in

that it established that the Radfords were still in contact with Jack Anderson,

although the conversations were innocuous in nature. In a conversation

between Mr. Morgan and her daughter in Portland, she revealed that one

of the first things Radford did upon arrival in Portland was to call Jack

Anderson and let him know where he was.

Radford was then transferred permanently to the Naval Reserve

Training Center at Salem, Oregon, and David Young requested that we

institute electronic surveillance (wiretap) coverage of Radford both at his

place of employment and his residence. Young assured us that the Attorney

General concurred. In order to effect coverage at the Naval Reserve Training

Center, it was necessary to place coverage on three separate lines going

into the Naval Reserve Training Center. However, no calls were monitored

which were obviously not directed to or from Radford. Even so, a large

volume of traffic was handled. Coverage was instituted on the Naval

Reserve Training Center lines 2/4/72, although no calls were monitored

until opening of business on 2/7/72 when Radford was scheduled to report

for duty. Coverage was instituted on the residence of Charles Edward

Radford II on 2/15/72.

On 2/17/72, David Young advised that coverage of Robert T.

Carroll and Georgianna M. Prince should be removed because of lack of

productivity, but that the coverage maintained at both Portland and Salem,

Oregon, be continued. Accordingly, the coverage on Carroll and Prince

was removed on 2/17/72.

Subsequently, at the request of David Young at the White

House, coverage on the Naval Reserve Training Center in Salem, Oregon,

and on William Frank Morgan, Radford's stepfather in Portland, Oregon,

was discontinued 4/11/72. The coverage on Radford's residence continued,

however. The coverage on Radford was finally discontinued on 6/20/72,

following the Supreme Court decision in the Keith case. It was not

discontinued on 6/19/72, as others falling under the Keith rule had been,

since we were awaiting a decision from the White House.

Although we felt at the time that the Radford case fell within

the meaning of the Keith rule, and so stated to the White House at the time,

a reexamination of the facts surrounding the coverage relating to leaks such

as those involved in the Radford coverage has resulted in a conclusion that

this coverage would not have been affected by the Keith decision, inasmuch

as such coverage was in furtherance of efforts by the President to protect

national security information, which function was excepted in the Keith

decision.

It is to be noted that in connection with wiretaps placed in

this instance, no written authority was ever obtained from the Attorney General.

The initial request came from the Attorney General in personal instructions

to Mr. Felt. Each was then approved by Mr. Hoover. Reports prepared

from review of the logs were delivered to the Attorney General as well as

the White House, so there was no question at any time that the Attorney

General was not aware of the coverage. Propriety of the coverage was

never in doubt at any time. It was unquestionably related to the national

security, and the necessity for maintaining the fewest possible records

relating to the coverage was obvious. This was the reason why no letter

was sent to the Attorney General requesting and getting individual written

approvals. This was the reason the coverage was reported by blind

memorandum on unwatermarked bond paper. This was the reason the

records were retained under heavy security in Mr. Felt's Office. This

was the reason that only a very few persons were privy to the coverage.".

The possibility of our coverage being leaked to Jack Anderson was very

real and very great. At the time, some of the Bureau's tightly held matters

were appearing in public print and the need for secrecy was apparent.

It is to be noted that following John N. Mitchell's resignation

as Attorney General, no further reports relating to the coverage were

delivered to the Attorney General's Office. Mr. Felt inquired of Attorney

• General Kleindienst if he desired to continue to get the reports and he

replied in effect that he did not know anything about the coverage and did

not want any reports relating to it.

Insofar as other records maintained, there were no records in

the electronic indices. However, Mr. Hoover instructed that the number

of wiretaps be included in the overall number of wiretaps which was a part

of his testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee, and a part of

the total number which had a definite ceiling. In other words when the total

number of wiretaps permitted by Mr. Hoover at any given time included one

of the Radford wiretaps, other national security taps were reduced by this

number.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,

INTERNAL SECURITY,

DISRUPTION OF HATE GROUPS

Re Bureau letcer to Atlanta dated 9-2-64.

To implement a counterintelligence program as

outlined in referenced letter, this office has been and will

continue to penetrate klan and hate organizations with

continued informant coverage."

This 'is the first step to leam

the complete organizational structure, members, their activities,

sympatnizers and followers, action they plan, including actions

of violence and distruction of property.

Once their activities, etc., are determined through

insanant coverage propes action can be taken to disrupt and :

neutralize their activities and efforts can be directed to

frustrate their plans. In addition, those specifically

responsible for unlawful actions are determined through informant

coverage.

Informant coverage will be specifically concentrated

on the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan since this is the

largest and most important of the klan groups in Mississippi..

Other pertinent organizations considered

1 For counterintelligence

action are:

Mississippi Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

United Kians of America, Inc.,

Knights of the Ku Kiux Klan.

Americans for the Preservation of the White Race.

NW 55131 DocId: 32989632

## Page 791

The pertinent individuals to first consider are the

state officers of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. They

aIE:

SAMUEL BOWERS Laurel Mississipp1, Impecial Wizard

JULIUS HARPER, Crystal Springs, Mississippi, Grand

"Dragon

BILBY BUCKLES, Roxie, Mississippi, Grand Giant

A G.. HARRINGTON, Ruth, Mississippi, State Organizer

Bureau of Investigation (KBI)

PAUG FOSTER, Natchez, Mississippi, State Chaplain

ACK WEATheRS, HaCtlesburg, MiSSISSIpPI, Contact

Leader. for the County and Secretary

Informant coverage will be supplemented by technical

installations where practical. Specifically, it has been

leamed through an informant

that a klan group holds meetings

in a building especially built for this purpose in Copiah

County. These meetings are held on a weekly basis. The

building is in a rural area several miles from the nearest town

and has access by only one road. During meetings guards are

placed at strategic points outside the building to insure

complete privacy.

An appropriate survey is being made to

determine the feasibility of a technical installation in this

building. The Bureau will be advised by separate communication

regarding this. Other logical points are being determined for

this type of coverage.

COUSZERINTELLICENCE ACTION

1. Liaison is established with the governor's office

to bring pressure to bear on local officials,

such as mayors,

chiefs of police,

sheriffs, etc.,

to solve recent bombings, •

church bumings, and other

acts of violence.

Jackson teletype to the Bureau nica 10-12-6.

captioned UNSUBS; EXPLOSION ON LAWN OF RESIDENCE OF ITOR

JOEY NOSSER-WATCHEZ-IASSISSIPI, 9-25-64, stated that an

Investigator of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patcol (MHS?)

advised he was instructed by Cavenor PAUl-buJOHNSON to

inform Acans County Sheriff EDELL ANDERS that the governor

was sericusly considering sending the National Guard into

Adass County to close down all gambling and liquor activity

in the county. Sheriff ANDERS advised he is in the process

of contacting all gambling

and liquor establishments in Adams

County to inform operators that if pertinent information regarding

Matchez bombings are not in his possession by October 15 he

will close all such establishments on October 16..

The jackson Office will, in each instant, that presents

itself in other localities and counties, arrange for similar

action and follow through on each.

2. • Repeated contacts and constant interviews of

known and suspected klan members are being conducted each

Saturday. This has been done since July, 1964, and is being

continued. This has a three fold purpose. It lets the klansmen

know the FBI is intesested and will be around. It also enables

E3I to know ter whereabouts on that day, become better

acquainted with theis hebits and gain more background information

regarding the person being interviewad. 'In several instances

during such interviews it has been possibla to convert certain

klansmen into informants, During interviews of klansmen who

are completely unco-operative and who want to know how we got

their name and way they are being interviewed we can flip

through the cards and pick out a name of another klansman

who

Is completely, unco-operative. This is a disruptive tactic

which can breed suspicion among themselves.

governor since he has indicated such to them. This type of

thing, of course, will be used at places where technical

4. Will participate with the governor in press

releases on the arrests of klansmen when appropriate. This

has been done in the recent arrests in McComb, Mississippi,

in connection with recent bombngs in that area.

5. Information has been developed through an informant

that a faction of the klan is interested in putting another

man in office rather: than the present person.

More information

is being obtained on this so as to exploit all possibilities.

and create dissention anong the leaders, and by doing so the

coportunity ray present itself to have the informant put in a

PERSONAL AND CONTIDENTIAL

Dear Mr.

HOOTer:

Thank you very much for your letter of July 17, 1964..

I have been giving this racial problen constant

thought.

thetically, I aid what I could yesterday in New lork to get that

office

and more eirectively in this mattere

You asked for suggestions and this is that I now offer

you for whatever little value it has.

(1) After writing you I recommended to the

Inspection Division that a study be made

relative to whether or not the Domestic

Intelligence Division can better handle

certain aspects of the Civil Rights-Racial.

hir. Gale is very much in favor

of this

inquiry and is moving promptly in

this matter.

I think the results of his

inquiry will be most helpful in evaluating

the situation.

(2)

What I have in mind basically is this:

You may want to, in light of his inquiry,

consider francierring the responsibility

for the developnont of informants in the

• KLU KIJE Klan

Thite Citizens Council and

related "hate" organizations to the Division

while leaving the responsibility for

investigating bombings, killings, and

Lorth where it now is.

My idea is:

Division can bring to bear all the

techniques,,

skills, and procedures which it has used"'n:

to successfully penetrate the Communist Farty

and espionage organizations to now penetrate

these hate organizations causing us so nuch

trouble.

(In talking to Mr. Tolson this

morning

I mentioned this briefly to hin.

If

(3)/ty idea is operationally sound,

and if this

1s done;

I mould immediately hold some

regional conferences in areas where the

IaCiaL LSSUE

is acute and get under way

in

these offices, special and

aggressive

prograns to carry

out this high level haily

informant develorment.

You ash completely

light when you say that informant develop

ment of the right kind is essentially the

solution to our current problem. The number

st intormants per se as we both know, are oi

no significance.

• What we must have is the

right kind of informants on the right level.

The old saying "The proof of the pudding is

in the eating" is relevant here because if

we had this kind of informant penetration,

we wouldn't have some of these unsolved cases now

causing us so much concern.

This is simply a

hard, stubborn fact we cannot theorize away.

(4) Further, we should expand our informant

penetration to cover some of these legitimate

but extremist organizations which we have up

to now ignored in this respect.

They often

are "supporting" forces for such as the k.k.K.

etc. and we ought to be on the inside of then.

This then is my response to your letter for now.

I have said,

the inspection Division is making the inquiry to

ascertain the operational facts and the feasibility of what I

suggest.

Cordially,

Sullivan

III. The Domestic Intelligence Division will assume the responsibility

for formulating and carrying out disruptive counterintelligence

programs against such organizations.

IV. The Domestic Intelligence Division, in addition, is willing to go

beyond the recommendations approved by the Director related to

the above and will, with Bureau approval, develop highly placed,

quality informants in certain legitimate organizations whose

activities generally relate to racial matters, such as

National Association for the Advancement of Colored

People (NAACP)

Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)

Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee (SNCC)

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) - headed

by Martin Luther King

White Citizens Council

(Each one, of course, will be handled on a carefully selected

basis and the action approved individually by the Bureau.)

V. Similarly, the Domestic Intelligence Division is willing to go beyond

what was originally approved and will, with Bureau authorization,

proceed to establish informants and sources in Negro communities

throughout the Nation for the purpose of developing intelligence

information relating to the degree of racial tension; the possibility

of violence erupting in the form of riots, etc.; and will disseminate

this material to all interested persons inside and outside the Bureau.

The organizations and objectives as set forth in paragraphs IV and V

above are being made the subject of a separate memorandum inasmuch

as this involves a matter of policy and will have to be acted on

separately subject to approval by the Director.

VI.

The Domestic Intelligence Division will follow and disseminate

information concerning demonstrations, picketing activities,

racial disturbances, riots and incidents relating to matters of

a racial nature. Any violations of a local nature which occur

during the above and are not Federal violations should be

disseminated by the Domestic Intelligence Division.

(However, if during the course of any of theabove situations,

a Federal violation is indicated, this should be immediately

material relating to civil actions being undertaken to enforce

compliance with the various elements of the Civil Rights laws.

II. The General Investigative Division will have the responsibility for

investigating bombings, police brutality and all other Federal

violations now assigned to the General Investigative Division.

I. The daily racial matters memorandum disseminated to the White

House, the Attorney General, etc., which is coordinated by a

Certainly, the items mentioned by Mr. Sullivan are

such as to be handled by the Bureau on an intelligence basis. The

racial field is a most fertile field for Communist Party and other

subversive groups. There are indications of this such as in the

cases of Martin Luther King and Michael Schwerner, one of the

missing civil rights workers from Philadelphia, Mississippi, and

other situations. Also there are reports of foreign funds being used

to support the current actions of Malcolm X. The racial strife and

disorder are of such major significance as to have international

aspects and this is tailor-made for the disruptive tactics of subversive

elements both right and left.

We cannot afford to divorce the national racial program from

its possible international aspects. The devices and tactics presently

in use in the security field should be utilized to the fullest in

developing intelligence information regarding national as well as

international developments in the racial strife. The tense racial

potential in major cities is a fertile field for subversive activities

both right and left.

We have seen from the killings in the South, for example,

the killing of Medgar Evers, that such appear to be isolated incidents

usually carried out by one man or a small unattached group occurring

on the spur-of-the-moment, such as the killing of the Lieutenant Colonel

near Colbert, Georgia, and the assaulting of a minister in the streets

in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

(REC-9" /

The investigation of the Klan and hate groups as well as the

development of informants in such organizations must, out of nécessity,

be handled as a whole. The following of the informants cannot be isolated

from the over-all investigation of the organizations just as the informants

in the Communist Party cannot be isolated from the organizations they are

connectes with.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: RACIAL MATTERS

Of course, any specitic offenses such as, for example,

the case of the three missing civil rights workers in Philadelphia,

Mississippi, "or cases involving brutality, bombings or any other

violations these individual investigations should be handled by the

appropriate substantive desks such as the Civil Rights Desk.

The over-all racial field is specifically an intelligence operation

for the Bureau.

It can best be organized when all facets are followed

and directed by one Division. The communist potential for activities

in this field would seem to be a major factor as evidenced by the doings

of Martin Luther King and his associates. The Bureau can best keep

abreast of the whole field by having all angles of the racial field united

in one Division utilizing the tactics which Mr. Sullivan has suggested

as being effective.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Personnel Transfers to Effect Proposed

Reassignment of Supervisory Responsibilities

in Racial Matters and Racial Informants

SA F. H. Freund has responsiki lity for Klan organizations for all

field divisions and supervises other classifications for ll western and

midwestern offices. •

SA L. A. Giovanetti has alternate responsibility for Klan organizations

for all field divisions and supervises other classifications for Atlanta,

Little Rock, Savannah and 4 other midwestern offices.

SA C. A. Parkis has responsibility for other hate organizations (8

currently active) for all field divisions and supervises other classifications

for Birmingham, Mobile, Cleveland and the 4 Texas offices.

SA F. P. Smith supervises classifications (other than racial informants

and organizations) for New Orleans, Memphis, Knoxville and 7 western

offices, and special cases.

SA H. E. Trent supervises classifications (other than racial informants

and organizations) for Charlotte, Savannah, Baltimore, Washington Field

office, Louisville and 2 midwestern offices.

Based on the distribution of work, Inspector's analysis reflects that it would

take 5 of the 7 men assigned to the Organizations Ynit to handle racial matters and

racial informants under the approved change of responsibilities. There are 7 clerical

employees assigned to the Organizations Unit of the Civil Rights Section and it is

felt that 5 of these clerical employees who generally handle the work being transferred

from the General Investigative Division to the Done stic Intelligence Division be

transferred along with the supervisors. Assistant Directors Rosen and Sullivan are

in accord that the proposed personnel changes are equitable, consistent and correspond

with the transfer of responsibilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That Supervisor in Charge Joseph C. Trainor and Agent Supervisors

Deegan, Freund, Giovanetti and Parkis be transferred to Division 5 (Domestic Intelligence

Division) concomitant to the transfer to that Division of sipervisory responsibility over

racial matters and racial informants (if approved to be handled by Mr. Mohr's Office).
