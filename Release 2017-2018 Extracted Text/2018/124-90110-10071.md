learned from contacts in New York that (fnu) PECAR, a Yugoslav trade

official in the U.S., is being recalled to Yugoslavia and wishes to

remain in the U. S.

According to MEROLA, PECAR will visit Miami from

12 to 19 April 1963.

3. While MEROLA has an unsavory background, the representative

who spoke with him is inclined to believe that he was telling the

truth in this Instance. MEROLA claimed that he has also informed the

U.S. District Attorney of the above development.

4. It seems probable that (fnu) PECAR is identical with the

subject of referenced memorandum, who was assigned to New York in late

1962 as in INTERTRADE representative.

We would appreciate

receiving any information available to

your Bureau concerning PECAR's alleged desire to remain in the U.S.

If the above information is true, this Agency may wish to

consider the desirability of contacting

in an effort to persuade

him
