SUBJECT : PDDONOR

REFERENCES : A. Memo Dated 16 February 1970
From DC/Security Research Staff

B. Memo Dated 14 August 1972
From DC/Security Research Staff

C. Acknowledgement and Release Form
Dated 12 July 1973

: 1. A careful review of the PDDONOR file substantiates
the fact that there were three unequivocal financial commit-
ments made to PDDONOR at the time of his defection in
February 1964. These three commitments were:

a. He would be paid $25,000 for each of the two
years he cooperated in place. Total $50,000.

.b. He’ would receive $10,000 for his part in
identifying William Vassal, a British
Admiralty employee as a KGB agent.

c. He would receive $25,000 per year salary
from the Agency.

2. The question at issue now is whether an additional
commitment was also made to PDDONOR to the effect that the
Agency would provide financial assistance to him to purchase
a home. According to PDDONOR, on 30 January 1964 in Geneva
prior to his defection in a conversation with his case officer,
Mr. Tennent Bagley he stated, "I will arrive with what I have
on my back - no home - no roof - no anything." The reply to
PDDONOR was as follows; "This will be taken care of. It will
be provided." This exchange in PDDONOR's view, constituted

a SECRET C

what he believes was a commitment on the part of the Agency

to provide him with financial assistance in the purchase of

a home. A memorandum dated 16 February 1970, written by

Mr. Bruce Solie describes this verbal exchange between PDDONGR
and his case officer. (See Reference A). In addition, a
memorandum dated 14 August 1972 also written by Mr. Solie
(Reference B) states that "Nosenko stated that prior to his
defection in Geneva, he discussed his future with Bagley and
made three requests, these being:

a. Employment at $25,000 per year;
b. $50,000 in savings account;
c. Assistance in purchasing a house.

According to Nosenko, Bagley, a day or two later, informed
Nosenko that his requests had been approved and Nosenko
considers this constituted a valid verbal contract."

3. From PDDONOR's viewpoint therefore an additional
commitment, quite separate and apart from the three listed
in paragraph 1 was made to him. Consequently, he now argues
that a payment made to him in July 1970, in the amount of
$20,000 and which he used as a downpayment on a house, was
the fulfillment of this additional commitment and not part
of the $50,000 he was promised for his two years in place.
This despite the fact that in the 14 August 1972 memorandum
as Mr. Solie states in paragraph 5, . . . "Nosenko also
considers that the assistance in purchasing furniture, a
house, etc., which he has been given since 1969 should be
considered as cancelling the matter of the $50,000.

4. What seems to have occurred is a change of position
on PDDONOR's part. While previously acknowledging that the
original $50,000 commitment had been met (paragraph 5 of
Reference B) PDDONOR now takes the position that of the
below listed payments only $30,000 should be applied against
the $50,000 commitment. The July 1970 payment of $20,000
should be applied against a separate commitment to provide
assistance in purchasing a home.

SECRET

$2,000 in March 1964

$8,000 in May 1969

$5,000 on 1 July 1970

$20,000 on 1 July 1970 (According to PDDONOR this
payment should not be applied
against the $50,000 commitment)

$15,000 on 12 July 1973

Thus, according to PDDONOR's reasoning $20,000 is still due him
as part of the original $50,000 commitment.

5. Several additional points should be noted. On 2 July
1973 PDDONOR signed an "Acknowledgment and Release" prepared
by the General Counsel in which PDDONOR releases and forever
discharges the US Government and the Agency from any claim for
money promised to him. (Reference C). In addition, the issue
of the $20,000 he says is still owed him does not surface in
the file until September 1978, 14 years after his defection.
The explanation of why this issue would arise at this late
date is not clear from available records.

6. Attached are copies of those documents which impact
on this issue. Because of the complexities of this case I
recommend that we request the Office of General Counsel to
review the entire case and provide a ruling on the legitimacy
of PDDONOR's claim of $20,000. After such a ruling we can
discuss our future course of action.

BERTOTALLY deuce A.

1, On3 February 1970, the undersigned discussed with the
Subject certain personal matters which are or could be problems in
the future and which should be given appropriate consideration in the

* near future. Jerry Brown/SRS was also petene cna it is. expected
will assist in the future in many of the routine handling problems
which could or will arise.

2. This memorandum is intended to present an up-to-date
report of the current situation in Subject case for any current action
or possible future action.

3. Subjectis presently residing with wife at his previous
address, There do not appear to be any particular PaNOanr problems.
The wife of Subject is six years older than Subject, but Subject was
well aware of this at the time of his marriage. Numerous comments
by Subject indicate that he is attached to the family of his wife and in

the opinion of the undersigned, the Subject is accepted as a member

“quit claim" and contract, ignored any previous promises and has
continued and will continue to ignore any previous promises to Subject
in any discussions with Subject.

20. As indicated above, a complete list of promises made
to Subject in 1964 is not available and for purposes of consideration
of whether Subject should be given some additional financial assist-
ance are not required. It is probably sufficient to list certain known

promises made to Subject on 30 January 1964 with the specification

_ that they had been approved by Mr. Helms. These promises included:

(a) $50,000 deposited in a personal account for
Subject.
(b) At least $10, 000 additional for the information
on VASSALL.
({c) Placing Subject under contract for $25,000
_, Per year for an indefinite period - 5 years - 10 years -
with built- in per for retirement and other benefits

to make up for the career Subject "was giving up."

| (d) Provision for living quarters, On 30 Janvary
1964, Subject, during the discussion prior to his de-
fection, stated he would "arrive with what I have on my

back - no horne - no roof - no anything." The reply to



Subject following the above statement was that, "This

will be taken care of. It will be provided. " Perhaps

this reply to Subject cannot be interpreted by a person

other than Subject as a promise of a house, but it can

be construed as a promise of something and there may

have been other discussions with Subject in regard to

housing in the United States.

21. Attached to the original of this memorandum are the
. following basic documents: A ,

(a) Copy of "quit claim" which was signed by

Subject in true name in April 1969 and notarized.

This particular document was actually entitled,
"Undertaking Regarding Obligations and Secrecy,"

. and referred to "current arrangements, " (separate

ceived ‘by Subject for the "quit claim. ied

{b) Copy of contract which was signed by Subject
in true name in April 1969 with effective date of

document in that it does not make reference to the

UNITED “STATES GOVERNMENT
Memorandum

TO : File DATE: 14 August 1972

FROM : Deputy Chief, Security Research Staff

suBjecT: Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO

1. On 7 August 1972 following a discussion of several items
of intelligence interest, NOSENKO mentioned the matter of the proposed
- book, stating that he doubted it would sell a large number of copies.
Reason for this opinion, according to NOSENKO, was that he realized
the information was over eight years old and it was not in the form of
a "spy thriller." He thought that the majority of readers who would be
. attracted would be those who had an actual interest in the KGB and its
effect on Soviet life rather than individuals interested in entertaining
reading,

2. NOSENKO then stated there was something he hesitated
to bring up, that he had hoped it would have been mentioned previously
by the undersigned and that he hoped his mention of it would not be mis-
construed. NOSENKO then stated that the matter was the salary to
which he considered he was entitled for the period of five years (April :
1964 - 1 March 1969), The latter date is the date the current con- psi
tractual relationship with NOSENKO became effective.

| SDNANSdae

3. NOSENKO stated that he is very grateful for what has
been done for him since 1969 and that he has no animosity for what
occurred previously even though it was "five years from his life."
NOSENKO stated that he considered he is living very well although not
saving any money for the future. He stated that he had hoped to obtain
some extra money from the sale of a book but now doubts sufficient
copies will be sold for him to realize any sizable amount from royalties. H
However, he is vitally interested in the book (or books) being published j
since it, in his opinion, would "hurt the KGB."

4, By way of background on the topic of the "five years,"

NOSENKO stated that prior to his defection in Geneva, he discussed

his future with BAGLEY and made three requests, these being:
(a) Employment at $25.000 per year;
(b) $50,000. 00 in savings account;

(c) Assistance in purchasing a house.
eesssiieseeienieees piste gustesoeaaian
According to NOSENKO, BAGLEY, a day or two later, informed
NOSENKO that his requests had been approved and NOSENKO considers

this constituted a valid verbal contract.

5. NOSENKO stated that in February-March 1964 he received

-a salary at the rate of $25,000.00 per year and he believes he also re-

ceived $5,000. 00 of the $50,000.00. NOSENKO also considers that

the assistance in purchasing furniture, a house, etc., which he has been
given since 1969 should be considered as canceling the matter of the
$50, 000. 00.

6. The matter which does concern NOSENKO is the salary,
less income tax, for the "five years" to which NOSENKO considers he
is entitled under the verbal agreement with BAGLEY in early 1962.
Since 1 March 1969, NOSENKO has not received $25,000.00 per annum
but this is not a point of discussion since he is very grateful for the
assistance which has been given to him during that time.

7. According to NOSENKO, he recognizes that if he had re-~
ceived the salary for the "five years" under normal circumstances he
probably would have spent all of it. However, since his inability to
receive and spend the money was not of choice, he feels that he should
be entitled to the salary which he would have received. NOSENKO
stated he would invest any money he received and would use it to provide
for the future since he now has a wife and family responsibilities.

8. The reply of the undersigned to NOSENKO was that the
above would be brought to the attention of the appropriate officials. An


effort was made by NOSENKO to obtain the opinion of the undersigned
as to whether his request was unreasonable, but only received a non-
committal answer to the effect that it did not pertain to any agreement
with NOSENKO in which the undersigned had any involvement.
