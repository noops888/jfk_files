OTHERWISE

Previous information has indicated that the
captioned anti-Castro organization is planning to carry out
a bombing reid over Cuba from Bimini in the Bahama Islands.
The airplane scheduled to be used in the raid reportedly is
lecated at the Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale,
Florida.

On December 13, 1963, our source in this matter
who has furnished reliable information in the past. learned
that a pilot and a copilot of the airplane were to proceed
to the Broward International Airport on December 14, 1963,
for a practice flight.

On December 15, 1963, the above-mentioned pilot:
and copilot were scheduled to. make another practice flight
frem the same airport. On this flight the airplane was to
be flow over Bimini for the purpose of observing the landing
field there and was scheduled to return to the Broward
International Airport on the same day. No landings on
foreigngsoil were to be made.

The source believed that an Aerp Commander airplane
would be used.

British authorities were advised of the above

information. @ } pp—
