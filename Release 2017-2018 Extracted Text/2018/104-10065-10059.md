DCI:

‘Pardon the form of this communication, but it
should get to you this morning earlyo

ceed Protiising negotiations on the Proenza and Mexico
= i history came apart yesterday eveming when Blakey came
i aH . back on the scenes We seemed to be on the verge of
ainen agreeing that they would accept a five months period
cae : from the Proenza 201 file (nnt the ops file) and
cn! sanitized sections of the Mexico history, limited to :
ioeeect Blakey and Cornwell only. No junior or other HSCA
mes pein staffers, We viewed this as showing that the papers |
a i had nothing to do with the HSCA charter, while showing
good faith at the same time.

Blakegp argues that he must See the entire Mexico
City history ome ang 20 years worth) years worth) to understand the
Station, which he intends to try to evaluate. He also |
plans to go to Ravens again, where he plans to inter=
view Proenza, and wants to know everything about her,
etce, in preparation for his meeting with her. We !
continue to feel it hasn't anything to do with the j
real HSCA charter. |

Blakey made it clear that if he sees it he will
want. staff members Also to See it, the likely
candidates being highly unacceptable for their renark~
able imaaturity.

Stokes is out of town, ‘but Blakey says he can get
in touch with him, If we have to go throtgh Blakey
Stokes' answer doubtleas will be "zive."™

We Seem to have run this course, and now have
the threat of subbeena hangng over us, I propose an |
early meeting: Acting D20 (perhaps with Chiefs LA Dive |
isbn and GA Staff), General Counsel, legislative Counse}
