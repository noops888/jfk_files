MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contact with Department of Justice

On 4 November 1975 I was called by Mr. Ron Malone (phone 187 - 4637),

one of the chree people from the beparemeng of Justice who were briefe

on ca Project matters by. Nr.

Jand me. Before returning his

call, I checked with Mr?

pffice (le was on a TDY) and

•з (Mr: 0'Re111), CI/EXO. Mr. O'Reilly) Instructed me to refer Mr. Malone

to Mr. Waller.

1 called Mr Waller to advise him, and was instructe

to carry on with the original briefing if that was what Mr. Malone wanted

When I returned Mr. Malone's call, he told me that the "file" on

Lee Harvey Oswald had "escaped" them.

(I assume that this means they

have misplaced their notes on Oswald.) Ms Hope Byrne (spelling?) would

be in. HQS that afternoon, and would like to see the file again. I told

Mr. Malone to have her contact Mr. O'Reflls), and I so informed

Mr. O'Retlly.) 3
