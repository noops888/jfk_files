“ PBRUMEN/LIRING-3

Action Required: None, FY!

1. Forwarded herewith for Headauarters information and
files is an Agent Service Record on Lin ING-3.

2. As Addressees are aware. Waliace P. ROWTON recruited

: and formerly handled LIRING-3 for the Hexico City Station,

Prior to ROnTON's PCS departure from Mexico City in July 1969,

it was deciced, after some discussion, to effect a turnover of

LIRING-3, retner than terminate him, Although LIRING-3 apparently

had been well "burned" with the Cubans, he seemed to have maintai:ed

gocd contacts with members of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) of

Guatemala. [n addition, in May and June of this year, he had

begun to develop access to some Panamanisén revolutionaries of

i interest. It was therefore decided to rur LIRING-3 on @ triat
basis to determine whether he could be used effectively against

“ Central American revolutionary targets, despite his problems with
the Cubans.

3. ROWTON introduced Leonard S. TORMET, in alias, to LIRING-3
on I July 1969. Although ROWTON had represented himself to LIRMG-3
as a Greek tusinessman, it was decided that it would be preferaple
to ‘clear the air" somewhat with LIRING-3, at least by making it

H
clear that he was in touch with a WOLADY oryenization, Nonethe-
less, no specific explaration was given LIRING-3 of his sconsor
and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told trat TORKET would be
seeing him for some months, since ROWTON was leaving the country
for an indefinite perioc. I

4, LIRING-3 was told that although TORHET was trusted by
ROWTON and collaborated with him, he represented a different
organization. LIRING-3 was also told that although he had in the
past been receiving between 3,000.00 and 3,509.00 Mexican’ peses
per month on an informal basis, TORMET's organization feit that
7500 Mexican pesos per month ($120.00) woulc te a fair salary at
this stage of the operation. TORMT explainec that he was eware
of LIRIKG-3's past activities directed against tre Cubans, and the
resuitant problems which hed arisen. It was exolained that
Af tosrer's* interest was in Central Arericen revolutionary activities.
In orcer to deal with LIRING-3's virtual "burneo" status with the
Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central American contacts that
the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that he tnerefore was no
longer directly involvec with any revolutionary groups or activities.|
Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer any assistance which

,

leftist beliefs and the friendships which he hed mace with FAR
H members while in orison in Guatemala. It would then be a matter
i of time before we could learn whether LIRING-2 «2s complete ly
i blacklisted in all revolutionary circles beca:se of his prociems
{ with the Cubans or whether he could provide information of valve.

5. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemed in good spirits
and he seemed to accep~ the turnover without any qualms, . Indeed,
pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after
he had been given various tasks to co by RUWIOX which he nad known
and warned in advance would cause suspicion, it was agreed that
LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that at this

stage all that could te done was to attempt to circumvent the

existing problems. i

6. LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributeble telephone
number and false name to ask for (Identity) to set up meetings
with TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and
@ prearranced vickup point was decided upon, It should be noted
that TORMET's QP vehicle was used for this first meeting with
LIRING-3, which means it was of course exposed to LIRING-3.

Je Subsequent to this meeting, LIRING-3 never initiated
contact with the Station. Although he might have lost the new
telephone number he was given to use with TORMET, there is no
Indication he ever again tried to call ROWTON, who was in Mexico
for at least three weeks after the | July turnover to TORMET.

8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, WIRING-3
has in effect terminated himself. Given the nature of this case--
the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as
@ RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years was never
very productive and-now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break

- off contact--it has been cecided to make no effort to reestablish
contact with him. .

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECOK)
FROM: WH/L

SUBJECT: 17 Septembi-r 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL
re LIRIG/3 & LIRING/4.

PARTICIPANTS: DRISCOLL, 4 i:RBE, FRANCIS and Laurence
PIPER (C/Mit/2/6) .

1. LIRING/4 is stil] very concerned about the in-
prisonment of LIRING/3. LIRING/4 wil} not travel to Cuba
until she is assured of the aafety nF FTPINT 2, CISCO
has Loorougniy discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out
the danger of attempting to intercede on L/3's behalf
through business contacts, L/4 contacted the Cubans for’
assistance but they stated there was nothing they could do.
They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money. L/3
has devised an open code which he uses in letters to let
L/4 know how he is. The letters are grim reading because
L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer.
Fellow prisoners have warned L/4 nct to let the Guats
transfer him to another prison as usually ends in the
prisoner being shot “while escaping. One good result
from the continued imprisunment of L/3 is that both he and
L/4 are furthering their bona fides with the Cubans.

2. L/4 is in telephone contact with the Third Sécre-
tary of the Wexican Enbassy in Guatenala. He has made
inquiries about L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign
Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the
assasination of the U.S. Auhassador) the Third Secretary
told L/4 there vere three possibilities, the first which
he considered out of the question was that L/3 would be
shot, the second was that 4/4 would come to trial and'be
released within a few weeks, and the third was that he woulé
receive a sentence of two or three years. Just prior ito
departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted
to atrange a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a
typed note under her apartment door. She did not make the
meeting. DRISCOLL later learned through phone tap material,
that she callea the Cuban Eabassy and informed them tle

H
Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined
500 pesos. The purpose of the payment was not identified.
Later she made a call from the Cuban Enbassy which indicated
she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay
the Mexicans. DRISCOLL. therefore, concluded she had not
returned to her apartment and did not get the note to make
their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba
Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and night see
the note but would be unable to identify the sender since
DRISCOLL uses a meaningless sé as a signature. !

3. DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Mexico to_
recontact L/4 to get the latest readinr on 1 Las le
Guavemaia. 41 the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3's
release ir behalf of the Nexicans and if it appears he will
be held indefinately, DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility
of our doing something to get L/3 out so the operation | ean
become active again.

4. In the above regard L/3 was discussed with
of the Guatemala desk believed has

a high enough contact with the Guats (ESX bx7z0-Prestdeats
brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Vexican coxpatriot out
of prison and back to Mexico with a mininun security risk.

DRISCOLL said he would initiate the cable upon kis return to
Mexico after he has talked with L/4, DRISCOLL felt he Should

possibly travel ala and have a preliminary neet with
L/3 before|—_] Inakes any all out effort to officially
request L/3's release. If, after seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is ‘satis—

fied that L/S is still an ally and is willing to cooperate
after _his release then DRISCOLL believes we should attempt to
have intercede with ESMAJOR/20. Hopefully, ESMAJOR/
20 wIII arrange the release so that all involved believe it
has been done at the request and urging of the Mexican Govern-
ment. DRISCOLL, however, would like L/3 and L/4 to believe ~
he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in order

to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation-
al tasks he will levy on them. ,

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

b. “Romulo,” who made at least one trip! “out
of tovn" from 17 February to 2 April 1969 (possibly
to Guatemala) during the period covered by ROWTON's
reports, appears to belong to a faction of the
Guatesalan FAR family disillusioned with PBRUMEN.

¢. The only real service asked LIRING-3 by”
“Romulo” during the period under review was to put
up an unidentified “comrade” scheduled to come to
Mexico at a date which "Roaulo" said he could not
determine exactly. This "comrade" was not the young
Guatemalan who dropped in on’ LIRING-3 for a couple
of days mentioned in the report dated 25 April.

d. LIRING-3 continues to collect clear evidence
i that LIRING has done its best to denounce him as a
i suspicious element definitely not to be trusted (see
reports dated 15 and 19 February).

3. Several attempts to tail “Romulo” did not produce
varticularly sienificant results. A pretext investigation of
apartment 102 of Calle Coahuila, where LIRING-3 met "Romulo;
produced the results contained in the Spanish language report
dated 26 Febru; forwarded as attachment #2. There were no

4. There is little question at this point that & Tinie
is close to persona non grata with LIRING. Hence, his further
usefulness against the PBRUMEN target is very limited.

ROWTON has kept away from LIRING-4 since LIRING-3's release

from prison in Guatemala. Although LIRING-4, following her
father's death (see MEXICO CITY-0125), may visit her mother

in PBRUMEN, she has no particular love for LIRING or the PERUMEN
authorities. On the Guatemalan side of this operation, the
Station is, as it has done many times in the past, waiting for
LIRING-3's Guatemalan contacts to make the next move.

Reports/Informaticn Submitted by Avert:

BOC. MICRO. SER.

LIRING/3 told Zowton that there ned ceen littie or no develo:zents
since he last saw howton (21/1/69), just before Rita nad left on
bis business trip tc Monterrey. He commented that he bed felt it
wiser not to teke any initiative in seexing out his FAR friends or
revisi the LIZING office until =.ston hed revurned. Ge stated
4 c2iled
ou his once in the company of Carlos veca, dut nothing significant
had energed from the casual conversation. Vega, at several points
in the conversation, nad sunbled scnething te Zodriguez about the
“erisis" but nieher cave an explanation. L/3 Rowton that he as-

that bis old Guatezalan frienc, Jacoto Rodriruez Padilla.h::

id

‘sumed that this rcmark referrred to tae currest factionelism in the

Guateraian revolutionary strurcle.

LIRING/3 then identified the attached pnote of Mario Avgesta Kendes
Aguilar icmediately at ohe first glance as thet of "R6nu10” »2ka "Mario
Mendez® and "Pavel." LIKING/3 did not recognize the photo 2ovton

showed him of Mario Otcriel Mendez Hoiina. i

Guidance/Inforzation Given to Agent: i :

Rowton told 1/3 that according to the very sketchy inforzation he

had concerning Mario sucosto Mendez Aszuiler it appeared thet the latter
belogged to a strongly anti-PBRUMNEN faction ani that this would perhaps
explain the turn-about of the LIRI“Gs after he, 1/3, hed indicated to
LIRING/9 that he was in contact with "Pavel." }

Rowton urged L/3 to seek out °Rémuio” at the calle Coahuila 221 safe-
house, and, failing this, to recentact Humberto Gonzélez ¥ega at his
hoze on calle Manzanillo, in the hope taat the latter gould arrange

a recontact with Kendez. : i é

j tects with the Caaiite Sanchez croup (Zeén darrics brothers and Zonulo)

which P3LUHZi «as epperently aitenpting to isciate in their own interest.

‘hen L/3 appeared a little censcled et this, Rowton contin ea that he
felt L/3 should, at the 18 Feb ceeting with “R4muio", C 1 the levter t¢d!

he knew the ceze th. Gs were up to and ask "Rénulo" yoint blank

whether he knew to what extent the G office was tryicg to sebotage—

FAR because of its nationalistic anti. K pesitions Zovton asked L/3
to entice "Rérulo” ito such a discussion in the hope that "pémulo®
would ask bin, 1/3, to belp ciscover any unilateral operations PBRUMEN

“ might be planning. Xeston continued that 1/3 stould te]1 Zoculo that
although he was virtually cut off fron the LIRING office, he stilt had

a great reny FEat%i% friends ( e.g. i 1) from

Rowton suisested thzt 1/3 could also propose to Hozulo that they both

going on. Jorge Godoy was cuite frank with his telling hic thatthe L1<T\G
office had advised hin to keep clear of LIRIS/3 because he was inot te be
trusted. Godoy continued thet a LIKIG officiel had told nim that LiaIvG/3
was being used ( perhaps urccrsciously at first) ty sone counter-revols-
tionery crgenization and that the LIRING Office based it essertion cn the
followine three points: (1) LIAING/3 hed been in touch with a foreimor wao
pretenzed to be a tusinessnan but who did not do any business with rSHviGN,
(2) LIgINS/3 had access to infornation that ectld coze only from a police

According to LIRiLG/3, Horge Godoy told him teat it was difficult to belive

he had to take it seriously in view of the source of the caarses, 1/3 See
told Rowtcn that he went over each point in rebuttal on a setter of principle
despite the fact thet Godoy's mind ovvio:sly vas already ande up. }

LIKING/3 told Roston that when he tclked later that day with "Résulo” he re= —
lated what had aappened with Godoy, "Héculo" replied that. those ‘LinIbG al-
legations were not to oe taken seriously. He cotzented: "se have already

if I/3 hed beer a spy he certainly would have ecatinued (vith the approval

Station had the LIEXSRACZ team cover the eatrance
of the building where ¥E\DEZ and other FAR members
have an apartment they use for clandestine meetings |
with LIRING-3. Despite the fact that the team
knows LIRING-3 from previous surveillance and that
a copy of LIRING-3's sxetch of MENTZ was also
provided, the LIEMBRACES spotted acitser man. The
Ustation naturally plans to cover another meeting |
and is also exploring the possibility of determining.
who rented the apartment and from vhon. It is of
sone interest to note that MENDEZ, aithough he gave |
LIRING-3 the agreed upoa recognition signal, may
still not be the "Pavel" LIRING-3 was told he would |
meet. LIRING-3 was shown a photograph of Oscar

several letters (see paragraph 2) troz nenbers of
the YAR in Guatemala warning him tnat adverse rumors:
(some of then calling him a WOFIRM agent) have been ‘
circulated in that country by Carlos PERZABAL Marcve.
Knoving that PERZABAL's father-in-law is a close
friend of Chief, LIRING, LIB: ‘3 sourced she rumors.
to the LIRING headman. He first took up the matter |
of the accusations made against hin with LIRING-9. |
The latter said there vas ndthing to this, but, and
: there was a but, LIBING-9 reminded LIRING-3 that =,
i \= the past he had been connected “with a person of |

mysterious and suspicious affiliations," a clear
reference to ROWTON, LIRING-3's Greek friend: When
LIRISG-3 insisted he wanted to discuss the matter
of the allegations made against his directly sith
Chief, LISING, LIRING-9 promised to make an appoint
ment for hin. This appojntsent, however, never
materialized. That Chief, LIRING may have spread ,
the allegations made.against LIRING-3 by PERZABAL
was confirred by” RolandoSUAREZ (see ROWION'S

--  Feport dated 31 December). LIRING-3 also took up
the matter of the PERZABAL denunciations with MENDEZ,
who told him that the FAP had paid no attention to [
them and even accompanied LIRING-3 to PERZARAL'S
house. LIRING-3, however, made the mistake of
giving his name when asked who was calling. The |;
result, as couid be expected, was that PERZABAL was !
“not in.” MENDEZ agreed to accompany LIRING-3 to
LIFING to talk to its Chief, but he warned LIRING-3 !
not to make accusations vithout proof. KENDEZ,
incidentally, does not appear to be pro-PBRUMEN.
This is interesting in view of the fact that

“a : CONTRERAS, vith whom he may. be identical, is a

©. So far, it does not seem that the FAR has
‘been greatly disturbed by the accusations made

% intensified. They did not hide that their purpose

was to broadcast LIRING-3's tame and the fact that

a Mexican had joined their fight. This was apparently

to zppeal to the Mexican left and gain their support.

While LIRING-3 has declared himsel! ready to go back

to Giatenala (if this was what ROWION wanted him to

do), he did not need ROWION to decide that broad-

casting his name from the jungles of Guatemala was

not a thing he wanted anyone to do. At Station -

directive, LIRING-3 pointed out that after his

recent inprisonment he had to take care of his wife

before doing any more for the cause. The best way

to do this was to take LIRING-4 to PERUMEN ind leave

her wiih relatives. This led LIRING-3 to ask what,

if anything, he could do for the FAR in Mexico.

So far, however, his FAR friends have not risen to

the bait. '

Bubject: LIRING/3 Report of Centact by “Pavel” of FAR. ‘ i

LIRING/3 reported to Rowton et 1000 on 23/12/68 at tne restaurant
in the Camino Zeal Hotel that at long last the FAR contact premised by
the Leén Barrios brothers. had appeared, LIAiiG/3 told Zowton that et about
4900 on 19 December a Guatezalan came to his apartment and intwpduced
himself as "a friend of Violeta.” L/3 invited him in but asked him not to
discuss anything sensitive in the presence of his wife. After about ten
minutes of chit chat in the spartrent, L/3 and the Guatemalan, who gave
bis name sizply as "Rémulo", went to a nearby restaurant to talx privately.

2. According to LIRING/3, the Guatemalan stated that he kad been ordered
by FAR to maintain contact with 1/3. When queried by 1/3 regarding the
Humberto Gonzdlez Vega whom he had met vnreviquely, "Pharts® o
"Oh, you mean '£] Gato’ ~ he's a good element, but he vill not beim your
FAR contact. I have been entrusted with that mission." "Rémulo" aiso stazed
that he knew Francisco Llera well and haG sorxed with hin in Guatemala City
seme time ago until Lara was arrested. "Rénulo" added thet unfortunately
Lara's nother hed betreyed him to the police and he barely escaped arrest
at that time. “Kéuulo” confirmed that Lara had been under a cloud as Sar
as his superiors were concerned and had whe iil-feted trip

in order to attempt to clear himself of charzes against him.

3. when LIRING/3 told "Rémulo” that be had been in touch with the LIRING
office since his return, the letter exclsined,"But what nave the a
people to do with us?" Tais gave L/3 the definite impression that "Rémulo”
hiaself was not in touch with a PSEUMEN representative in Mexico City,and,
4m any case, didnot like the LIRIKG estadlishzent. i

&, He then asked 1/3 to give him a summary report of the arrest and’ detention,
1/3 told Rowton that he balked at this at first, protesting to "“Rémulo™ that
he had already given the details tc the Leén Sarrios brcthers and"Cebollito”
who he was sure had passed on the report to the PAR in Guatemala. “hen
“Rémulo" explained that he would aspreciate en oral report on the spot since
he wes not fully informed beceuse of communications problems, LIRi¢G/3 told
Rowton thet he went over the whole episode for "Rémulo's” benefit. "Rémulo*
then asked to see LIRING/3 again at 1100 on 21 December to continue their
discussion. He promised td-neet L/3 on the, street in front of his apartment
house at the aprointed tine. j j : i
Se LURING/3 continued to Rowton that such to bis surptrise and; indignation
he received a letter on the following day(20/12/68) fron era the smother |



: against LIXING/3. The letter, which 1/3 read aloud to Rcwton, went an to

of the Leén Zarrios brothers, in which,smong other things, she stated that
“the man on the bgcycle", which L/3 explained to Kowton meant Carlos
Persabal bed written a letter containing grave charges

assure L/3 that these charges were not believed but constituted a source
of annoyance to tne writer's frienis.

6. LIRIRG/3 continued to Rowtcn thet he felt so indignant and shocke1 at
this unpleasant develorpzent that he decided to see the Chief LIKING and
have it ait with him. L/3 explained that since the Chief LIRING is on very
friendly terms with the father-in-law of Persabai he might be aware of tke
letter and even possibly enccurgaged FPersabal to write it. L/3 told Rowton
that he then got in touch with LIXING/2 by telephone andimade ‘a date to meet
nim at tne LIMIKG establiskzent at 0930 on 21/12/62, shen he arrived et the
gate at thet time he was told that LIRING/2 had not yet arriveed. After a wait
of sone twenty minutes, LIRING/2 appeared but asked LIRING/3 to wait a nae
a

instead of LIRING/2 and talked with LIZING/3 on the patid. LIRING/3 explained
that he wanted urgently to talk with the Chlef LIZING sice something had
come up with regard to Persebal. He reminded LIRINC/9 that he originelly had
expbresseé a desire to have a face-to-fece ccnfrontation/with Pershbal in
the LIKING office so that he could preseut his report on'the arrest in sis
presence. LIRIiG/9, according to LIAING/3, brusbed this off again with the
comment, "Sut as I told you before, you're making a mountain of a colehill.
You're exaggerating the whole business."

9. LIRING/3 tole Rowton that he then took out Martha's letter and insisted
that LIRING/9 read it. The latter expressed amazement at ‘the revelation of cs
Persabal's action but did not agree with LIRING/3 that the Chief LIKING i
would be able to shed ligat on it. LIRING/3 then told LIAING/9 that be did
not like the gemes that everycne seemed to be playing with him, and asked
LIRING/9 point ba’ank what it was thet zotivated hin to ask for a written

whereas on the other hand tliey were not honest with him in telling him shat)
they thought of hie. I/9 then assured L/3 of his confidence inhim and sdded|
that in the past certain persons, including Hugo, the assistant to LIR1iG/11,
bad felt thatLIzinc/3 had been connected with a person o: mysterious and
suspicious affiliationa.:L/3, understanding this to be a clear allusion to
Rowton, admitted to having known this person in the past 7 having hed

on hig political activity. LIZING/9 acreed and aated that it was really a
thing of the past that should not bother iIZIHG/3. He promised to muke an
appointment for LIRING/3 to see the Caief LIRING sozetine tae following week.

8. LIginG/3 continued that when ke met «ith "Rémulo" later thet morning he
also showed the letter froz Mar‘ to hin. According to 1/3, ;"Rémulo" becane
indignant and sugcested thet they talk to Fersabal tocether to get to the
bottom of the matter. 1/3 and "Zizulo" then took a taxi to the residence of
Fersabal in the hope of finding nim in at the time. when L/3, Rowever, rang
the outside bedl ne was told by& woman ( who he suspects mxxk was either
Persabal’s wife or sister-in-law) that iersaval was not at boxe. 1/3 noted
the woran's astonishrient in cer tcue or voice woen ce evavea cis name es ues

given his nane since it was obvious that mem Liddeietee was at nome but did
not want to see LIRING/3.

‘9. According to 1/3, "Rémulo" at the second meeting stated thet “several”

friends of his were planning to return to Guatemala to continue their work
for the PAR and that he hoped thet LIKING/3 sight be able to telp in this

this matter. He promised to see L/3 azain at 1600 on 24 Deceaber ,1968.

herewith. L/3 told Rowton taat Lépez stated that he was anxious to

send various items, including medicines, to FBRUMEN,and appealed to

L/3 since he "understood" that 1/3 and his wife had contacts through

which he could send the items. Lépes, according to 1/3 appeared very

interested to be reassured that L/3 really did have cood contacts
with the LIRING establistzent. When L/3 assured him trat he did see

LIRING respresentatives, Lépez went on to re¥eal that: he was a friend

of Carlos Perzabal and thet he was fully informed concerning the

recent "tragic situation" of both Persadal end LIRINGS/3. This bomb

against Perzabal. shen Lépez

and Mexicu. He added that,"as you know", Persabal was ynown even to
CSsar Montes. L/3 retorted, "But Montes has been stripped of his
authority,as you should know." This led 1/3 to the counterclaim that
he also had good friends in Guatemala and Mexico who could testify op
bis bebals. =

LIRTKG/3 told Rowton thet he then showed Lopes a pra: copy
of the attached letter which he had written to Perzabal demanding

: an explanation of the See he was known to be, spreading against

asked Lépez to keep the copy and tell his good friend perxebal where
he got it and under what circumstances. {

LIRIKG/3 continued to Rowton that be had to cut short ae rather

fax short time earlier thet afternoon, he told Rémulo about the
corments made by Carlos l4pez. Rémulo, according to L/3, did not
indicate that he knew Lofez at all, but agreed with 1/3 that tie
accusations of Perzabal must be met head-on. He suggested the fol-
lowing course of action: 1/3 should wait for the “reply from Karta

Perzabal before taxing up the matter with the Chief LIRING. =

ef any use to them in sie aountains. Taey sirpiy saic that they felt it
would be useful to give vide pudlicity to 1/3's presesce in the mountains,

have it give it careful thought, inaszuch as it raised a number of very
serious problems with hia and his fazily. Mario Mendez and tis friend e=sn-

frox #oolwortts nezr the corner of Insurgextes Sur) ené found "Réaulo”

in apartment 12 in the company of two other persons, previously unknown
to LIRING/3. Zoth wopeared younzer than "sézulo” and one could easily be

Guatemalan accent, and revealed in his rescarxs an excellent knowledge of
Guatenala. The Zcuadorian, who hea the most pleasant personality of the
three, remarred during the conversation taat he had been imprisoned in
tke old penitentisry in Guatemala City and subsequently "thrown" over the
vueuce vo caivesor. :

2. LERING/3 tolé nowton that the small apertzent contained nothing that he
could see but a table and several chairs and was obviously a safehouse
rather than a resicence. "Rémulo™ later co-Zirmed tais when he told 1/3

at the entrance to the apartment building so taat 1/3 would not have to
ring the bell end wait outside the door unnecessarily. |

3. Daring the friendly discussicn that ensued in the ee See es took
the line previcusly agreed on with Rowton with apparent success. The young
Eousdorien showed his approval by nodding ais head several times, when L/3
outlines his reasons for not eccerting at cnce the propesal to return to
Guetemala. "Romulo" was less sympathetic, and waen L/3 stated that he felt
it necessary in any case to travel first to PBSUMEN to cet his wife settiled
j "R6mulo" shrugged bis shoulders,renerking, "Sut can't sae icet by herself."
t L/3 then offerred to be of any service while in FBaUESH, but did not re-

H ceive any pesitive reaction. "Résulo” responded simply with a "Yes, we'll

of persons suspected of beirg "Rénvlo" and the fat colleague.: LIRTHG/3

Berrios brothers told him they would arrance fo1' "Favel” to coatact hia

3. Rowton then expressed to LIRING/3 bis grave reservations coceerring =e
the proposed travel of L/3 to Guatemala in the cozpany of his! new FAR
friends. Rowton pointed out that such a trip would be extresely risky for
L/3 personally wita little hope of any worthwhile production for Zovton.
LIRING/3 agreed eri said that he felt he would have to continue to stall,
even at the risk of alienatirg the affections and confidence or his new

contacts. Rowton suzgcested that L/3 tell them that before he ould pessibly

consicer such a return trip he would have to visit FSaUMEN with bis wife
and child to get them settled there so that they would rot agein be, exposed
‘to the difficuities they suffered during his last trip - fingncial as well

4. At 1000 on 7 January,1969, at tne restaurant of the Cazing Real dotel
EIRING/3 reported to Xowton tuat ne had ‘ust received three letters fron
Harta Barrics de Le6n, the mother of tne Leén Parrios brothers (Miguel

and Jufn) whom he had orisinally set during bis confinement in Guatemala
City. Ee gave the original letters, Zowton's trauslztion of we ch is
attached, to Rowton to copy and study. LIRING/3 appeared genuinely sheken
at the revlaticn in the second perz=raph of the letter,dated| 29/12/68,
that the "man cn the bicycle" ( Carlos Perzabal) had written! in bis letter
to Marta that LIRING/3 was “working Zor another cozpany (4C?PIEM) und toat
Merte chanla ant annfide in encthice LIVTNG/2 mticht write tal hen # TTETNA/R

told Rowton that he bad suspected that Perzabal aad accused him of perhaps
causing the arrest, but be never creaned that Ferzabal would’ £0 so far as
to accuse biz outright of being a ZC 2THM gzent.

2. LIRING/3 then speculated taat F2rzabal could not have cone such a serigs
thing of his own initiative, but cust necessarily heve deen Anspired ty
soze outside source, most probably tue LIRING esvablisiment. He continued
that he therefore felt it rore necessary than ever to put the LIgIiG Chief
"up against the wall" end force hii to adrit ais conplicity.| LIHING/3 added ©
that he hed seen "Romulo" on 3 Jaccery a3 plenned and had told him about
the letter from Marta and Ferzabal's treachery. ccording tol LIxikG/3
"Rémulo” became indignant and volunteered to accorpany LIXING/3 to the
LIRING establishment to have the ie thing out once and for all. LIxi:G/3
appeared so disturbed at the unexpected news that Rowton found it impossible
to check with him on the exact tine and place he allegedly wet "Rémulo” on
Friday, 3/1/69. zhen Rowton stated that he felt it very importent to iden-
tity "Résulo” positivgely ( Rowton alleged that he had access to the Gober-
naciéa "mug file" of persons wanted by the Guatemalan Government and given
to the Mexicans for identificaticn), LIRING/3 volunteered to arrange to
meet "Rémulo” somewhere in public a3 soon 28 possible so that koston could
get a good lock at him ( as ke had rrefiously done in the case of "Garcia").
3. Rowton advised LIRING/3 @66 not uncer any circumstances to attespt to
lure "Rémulo” to any public place, especially since the latter bad estab-
lished a pattern of meeting with him in a safehouse, but simpiy to tell
Rowton the next time he was invited to visit tue safehouse and iouton sould
cover the place from as conveniect a’ spot as possible (e.¢. [wi Hoolworkh's

This is a Headquarters case in which the Station
participates only as a letter drop via ANSTRUT-8

13. As can be scen, all the above has been previously
reported to Headquarters, In view of this, and the fact that
the PBRUMEN Section, in addition, submits regular quarterly
progress reports on its projects, it is felt that reporting
on the Station's activities against the PBRUMEN target is
fadequate. Therefore, the Station once more suggests that
formal PBRUMEN Section monthly or bimonthly reports be
discontinued. Please advise. i

Correspondent of La Voz de Yexico, an official orgaai of the
Mexican Communist Party (see HMA-27727, 24 November! 1965),
ZEPEDA apparently also visited Comsunist China. He appears
to be well acquainted with LIRING-9. In view of the above,
the Station instructed ROWTON to ask LIRING-3 to refrain from
attempting to use ZEPEDA to obtain a "bootleg copy of the
LIRING letter to the Mexican Communist Party. Tne Station
feels a copy of this letter would add little to the known fact
that LIRING-3 is a person that LIRING continues to view as
“suspect. LIONHEART has been asked for up-to-date insrorma~

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Méeting with LIRINS/9.

4. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 0915 on 27/14/é5 that he had met with
L1xIng/9 at the LIRING establishwnent frea about 4745 until 1960 on 26/11/63.

Ee stated that he gave LIR1"G/9 his written report on his recent experiences

in Guatemala and the conclusions be drew fron talking with Paz neabers there.
L/3 also stated that he did his best to assure 1/¢ that, aithouch he sympathized
with the laments of the Leén farrios brothers, he was really on the PBxUMEN
side and offered to do all he could to assist the-IhINGs in their attezpts to
assist the revolutionary forces. The following is Rowton's reconstruction of
the conversation, based on LIRING/3's report:

L/3: "I'm sorry to be late, but I had to finish the report."
L/9: "Alright. I've been waiting here at the gate so there wouldn't
be any furtner delay. Let's go to my office so we can bed pri-

vetoes?

Upon entering office, 1/9 removes jacket and offers L/3 a seat in the
office. i
L/3: "Well, here's my report. I must apologize that it’s in rough draft
form. I had to write it rather burriedly when my vife was not around.
It's really just a series of badly orgarized thoughts and ideas but
I'll be glad to explain. There's a great deal more, of course, that
I could explain on the subject. Do you wish me to read ite?
t L/9: "Ko, that's alright. i
L/9 glences through the report and continues: j
"I'll read it carefully later. I really didn't expect such e long
report. I appreciate it. In the meantime, how are you dobng in your
: personal affeirs??
B L/3: “sell, as I told you last time, I'm very much up in tne air at, the
-. - .moent. My exposition has started but is not going as|well as can be
expected - as well as I had hoped. You know, these things have their
up's and down's. I'll sell sone things, at least to cover my current
expenses, but I'll really have to get better organized financially
in the near future. The first problem that I'm really worried about
> "is my wife, and I frankly feel that I sust appeal tojyou f for help.
1/9: "Of course. Well, what is the problem?”
1/3: “As you know, sone time ago my vife and I bad a serits of ‘unpleasant
situations that alzost led to a separation..”
