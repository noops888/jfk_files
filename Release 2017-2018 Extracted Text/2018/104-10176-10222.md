Of LIRING-3ªs past activities directed against tre Cubans, and the

resultant problems which had arisen.

It was explained that

Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer any assistance which

members while in prison in Guatemala.

could learn whether LIRING-? nes complete i

blacklisted in all revolutionary circles because of his proulems

with the Cubans or

whether he could provide information of value.

LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemed in good spirits

and he seemed to accepi

the turnover without any qualms.

he pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after

he had been given various tasks to do by RüNTON which he had known

and warned in advance would cause suspicion.

It was agreed that

LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that at this

stage all that could te done was to attempt to circumvent the

existing problems.

LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributable telephone

number and

((dentity) to set up meetings

Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and

a prearranged pickup

point was decided upon.

It should be

noted

TORMET"s OP vehicle was used for this first meeting with

The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, WIRING-3

has in effect terminated himself.

the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as

a RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years was never

very productive and now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break

contact--it has been decided to make no effort to reestablish

contact with him.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECOND

FROM:

SUBJECT:

WH/1 L

17 Septembir 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL

re LIRLIE & LIRING/4.

PARTICIPANTS:

DRISCOLL, VURBE, FRASCIS and Laurene

PIPER (C/WI/Z/G) .

1.

LIRING/4 is still very concerned about the im

prisonment of LIRING/3.

LIRING/4 will not travel to Cuba

until she is assured of the defaty no prores.

has enoroughly discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out

the danger of attempting to intercede on L/3's behalf

through

business contacts.

L/4 contacted the Cubans for

assistance

but

they stated there was nothing they could do.

They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of noney.

L/3

has devised an open code which

he uses in letters

to let

1/4 know how

he is.

The letters are grim reading because

L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer.

Fellow prisoners have warned L/4 not to let the Guats

transfer him

to another prison as this usually ends in the

prisoner

being shot "while escaping."

One good result

from the continued

imprisonment of L/3 is that both he and

L/4 are furthering

their bona fides with the Cubans. i

2.

L/4 is in telephone contact with the Third Séere-

tary

of the Vexican Enbassy in Guaterala.

He has made

inquiries about

L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign

Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the

assasination of the U.S. Ambassador) the Third Secretary

told L/4 there vere three possibilities, the first which

he considered out of the question was that L/3 would be

shot, the secord was that i/4 would come to trial and be

released within a few weeks, and the third was that he woule

receive a sentence of two or

departing

three years.

Just prior to

Mexico

on this current trip,

DRISCOLL attempted

to atrange a meet

with k/4 in the usual means by slipping a

typed note under

her apartment door.

She did not make the

meeting.

DRISCOL later learned through phone tap material

that she called the Cuban Fabassy and informed

them the

SECRET

101-

98501

---

## Page 13

and a..

C-STET

Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined

500 pesos.

The purpose of the payment was not identified.

Later

sbe made a call from the Cuban Eabassy which indicated

she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay

the Mexicans.

DRISCOLL, therefore, concluded she had not

returned to her apartment and

did not get the note to make

their meeting.

DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba

Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and night see

the

note

but would be unable to identify the sender since

DRISCOLL uses a meaningless scott as a signature.

DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Nexico to

recontact L/4 to get the latest

1130= -1=165

dI the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3's

release ir behalf of the lexicans and if it appears he will

be held indefinately:

DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility

our doing

something to get L/3 out so the operation

become active again.

In the above regard L/3 was discussed with

a high enough contact with the Guats (ESW:JOR/20-Presidents

brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Merican cospatriot oul

of prison and back to Mexico with a minimun security risk.

DRISCOLL said he would initiate the cable upon his return to

Mexico after he has

talked with L/4.

DRISCOLL felt he should

possibly travel

to Guatenala and have a preliminary neet with

nakes any all out effort to officially

request Li3's release.

If, after seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is satis-

is still an ally and is willing to cooperate

after his release tben DRISCOLL belieres we should attempt to

have

intercede with ESNAJOR/20.

Hopefully, ESHA JOR/

20 will arrange

the release so that all involved believe it

has been done

at the request and urging of the Mexican Govern-

ment.

DRISCOLL, however, would like L/3 and Lia to belteve

he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in order

to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation-

tasks he will levy on them.

"Romulo, " who made at least one trip! "out

of town" from 17

February to 2 April 1969 (possibly

to Guatemala) during the period covered by ROFTON's

reports,

appears to belong to a faction of the

Guateralan FAR family disillusioned with PBRUMA.

"Romulo" during

real service asked LIRING 3 by

period under revier was to put

up an unidentified "comrade" scheduled to come to

Mexico at a date which "Rosulo" said he could not

determine exactly. This "comrade" was not the young

Guatenalan who dropped in on' LIRING3 for a couple

of days mentioned in the report dated 25 April.

d. LIRING-3 continues to collect clear evidence

that LIRING has done its best to denounce him as a

suspicious elenent definitely not to be truster (see

reports dated 15 and 19 February).

Several attempts to tail "Romulo" did not produce

particularly sienificant results.

A pretext investication of

apartment 102 of calle Coahuila, where LIRING3 met "Romulo,

produced the results contained in the Spanish language report

dated 26 February forwarded as attachment #2.

eitimexier

There is little question at this point that LInING x's

is close to persona non grata with LIRING.

Hence; his further

usefulness against the PBRUNEY target is very limited.

RONTON has kept away from LIEINGA since LIRING-3's release

Although LIRING 4, following her

father's death (see MEXICO CITY-0125), may visit her mother

in PBRUMEN, she has no particular love for LIRING or the PERUMEN

authorities.

On the Guatemalan side of this operation, the

Station is,

as it has done

many times in the past, vaiting for

LIRING 3's Guatemalan contacts to make the next move.

proving steadily and he felt this a good sign, i-asnuch as he felt certain

that

Iden B

would not take the initiativeol recontacting LlaiiG/3

without prior consultation vith 2IFI/S/9 and LIRING/2.

IIRIXG/3 shen told Routon that II'E.o/t hod received a very ressiristic

to recontect IlPliG/9 and tell hin about iIizid/4's application for the

ally since LIPI:G/3 had originally centioned LIHI.o/k's desire to visit

her sick father and the problem this represented for him, when he first

talked to LIÄIiG/9 after his retun from Guarenala.

MIRINC/3 t-ld Rowton that he feit this would also constitute a good pre-

text to sound out LIRING/9 about his persoral feelings toward LIRING/3

and his own situation in the LIRIG CIfice. Rowton surrested that LIRIie/3

take this occasion to mention casually that he was still in occasional

contact with the Guateralans and to five LIPIG/, the names

the enoticral

strain that LIxLG/4 war underroing as a result of the bad

financial situation he found hirself in, and he felt'tzere was no real

solution in rexico. In iRrEN, horever, he could isare much nore easily

for his wife and child, siice sost of his basic finaerial probless sould

approach in replying to Iden B

Fe stated that he tele Iden B ibat in

principle ne agreedbut he had to face the relities of the situation. First

he was not at all certain that he could convince his vice to make such a

in the Camino Real Hotel that at long last the FAR coltact promised by

the León Barrios brothere bad appeared, LI:ing/3 told Zorton that at about

1900 on 19 decenber a Guatenalan care to his apartment and intonduced

himself as "a friend of Violeta." I/3 irvited bim in but asked bin not to

discuss anythire sensitive in the presence of bis wife. Alter about ten

minutes of chit chat in the apartient, 1/3 and the Guatemalan, sho gave

bis nane sliply as "Rómulo", went to a nearby restaurast to tali privately.

2e According to LIRIIG/3, the Guatemalan stated that he had been ordered

by FAR to maintain contact with I/3. When queried by I3 regarding the

Fumberto González Vega whor he had met previnnely: "D'= c9=i=icaa,

"Oh, you mean 'El Gato' - he's a good element, but he dill not beir your

FAR contact. I have been entrusted with that mission." "Rómulo" also stased

that be knew francisco lara well and had worked with biz in Guatenala City

some time ago until lara was arrested. "Rómuio" added thet unfortunately

Iara's nother had betraged him to toe police and he barely escaped arrest

at that time. "Romulo" confired that Lara had been under a cloud as car

as his superiors were concerned and bad mase the 11l-feted trip

in order to attempt to clear bimself of charges against bim.

3. When IIRING/3 told "Romulo" that he had been in touch with the TIRING

office since his return, the latter exelsined, "But what have the LIniNG

people to do with us?" Iris gave 113 the definite Impression that "Rómulo"

binself was not In touch with & PEZUMN representative la Metico City, and,

In any case, did not like the iIrING establishment.

*. He then asked I/3 to five him a sunmary report of the arrest and

detention.

I/3 told Rowton that be balked at this at first, protesting to "Rómulo" that

he had alresdy given the detaile to the León 3arrios brothera and "Cebollito"

who he was sure had passed on the report to the FAR in Guatemala. iber

"Romulo" explained that be would appreciate en oral report on the spot since

he was not fully inforred beczuse of commurications problens, LIRIrG/3 told

Rowton that he went over the whole episode for "Rómulo's" benefit. "Rómulo"

then asked to see LIRIFG/3 again at 1100 on 21 December to continue tbeir

discussion. He prorised to neet 1/3 on the street in front of his apartment

house at the apfolated time.

of the leon Barrios brothers, in which, snong other things, she stated that

"the nan on the bacycle", which I/3 explained to Horton seant Carlos

Persabal

had writter a letter contalaing grave charges

against LIRI'G/3. The letter, which I/3 read aloud so acirton, vent on to

assure I/3 that these charges were not believed but constituted a source

of annoyance to the writer's frienãs.

6. IIRING/3 continued to Rowton that be felt so indigrart and shocked at

this unpleasant development that he decided to see the Chief LIKING and

have It at with bin. L/3 explained that since the Chief IRING is on very

friendly tarns with the father-in-law of Persabal he might be aware of tte

letter and even possibly ercourgaged Persabal to write it. I/3 told Borton

that be then got in touch with LIRING/2 by telephone andi made a date to meet

nim at the LikliG establistent at 0930 on 21/12/62, shen he arrived a the

gate at that time he was told that IIRING/2 bad not jet arriveed. ifter a wait,

of some twenty minutes, LIRINS/2 appeared but asked LIRING/3 to wait a little

longer since he was very busy. Alter another annoying wait, LIRING/9 appeared

instead of iIRLiG/2 and talred with Ilaiso/3 on the patio. LIRING/3 expiained

that he wanted urgently to talk with the Chlel LIBING slice sonething had

come up with regard to Persebal. He reninded LIRIO/S that he originelly had

exppressed a desire to have a face-to-lace confrontation with Persabal in

tbe LIRING office so that he could present bis report on the arrest in sis

presence. Wking/9, according to timiss, brusted tois off again with the

comment, "But as I told you before, you're making a mountain of a colestll.

Iou're exaggerating the whole business."

7. LIRING/3 told horton that be then took out Martha's letter and insisted

that LIRING/9 read it. The latter expressed amazerent at the revelation of

Persabal's action but did not agree with LIRING/3 that the Chief LIBING

would be able to shed ligat on it. LIRING/3 then told LIRING/9 that be did

not like the gates that everyone seemed to be playing with bim, and asked

IIRING/9 point blank what 1t was thet rotivated his to ask for a writter

report of the arrist and, after 1/3 cosplled with the request, to drar bis

feet. I/3 continued that he felt he had been frank with the WRING office,

bereas on the otber band they were not honest with bim in telling bin bat

they thought of him. Is then assured 13 of bis confidence inhim and added

that in the past certain persons, including Hugo, the assistant to WRIiG/11,

and felt thathlaihe/3 had been connected with a person of aystertous and

suspicious affiliations, 113, understandlag tbis to be a clear allusion to

Rowton, admitted to baving known this person in the past

•a few business transac-ions with bim, including the sale of a number of

his paintings, but insisted witb sore annoyance that this had got bearing

on his political activity. IIRI3/9 acreed and added that it was really a

thing of the past that should not bother iI3I:G/3. He promised to make an

appointment for LIRLiG/3 to see the daiel LIkING soretime the following week.

B. IIRInG/3 continued that whea he met nith "Romulo" later that morning he

also showed the letter fror Martze to his. iccording to I/3, "Rómulo" became

Indignant and sussested that they talk to Fersabal together to get to the

botton of the ratter. I/3 ard "Pémlo" then took a taxi to the residence of

Persabal in the hope of finding ain in at he time. xben W/3, however, rang

as he and his wife arrived at their apartment, they found a"chaparite

who introduced himseil as Carlos López, a Guatenalan friend of

Jacobo Hodriguez (Padilla), and gave I/3 a note of introduction from

that ferson. 1/3 Eave Boston the originol lotte, inion in auraineù

herewith. I/3 told Roston toat Iópez stated that he was anxious to

send various items, including medicizes, to FBRUMEN, and appealed to

I/3 since be "understood" that I/3 and his wife had contacts through

which be could gend the items. Lopes, according to i/3 appeared very

interested to be reassured that L/3 really did nave good contacts

with the LIRIlC estabiiscent. When I/3 assured hin trat be did see

LIRING representativeg, lopez went on to rereal that be was a friend

of Carlos Perzabal and that he was fully informed corcerning the

recent "tragic situation" of both Persabal and LIRIlG/3. This bomb

shell shock 1/3 badly and be felt obliged to launch into a distribe

against Perzabal. then López conmented that "naturally de have to

take Ferzabal's word ageinst yours, since he Exor him better," I/3

told Rowton that he demanded an explanation of who the "we" were.

Lopez simply replied that it meant"ilortant persons in Guatemala

and Mexico. He added that, "as you know", Persabal was known even to

César Moctes. I/3 retorted, "But Montes has been stripped of his

authority,as you should know." Ibis led 1/3 to the counterclaim that

indicate that be knew iopez at all, but agreed wito I/3 that tee

accusations of Perzabal must be net bead-on. He suggested the fol

lowing course of action: I/3 should wait for the reply froz Yarta

(rother of León Barrios brothers) as to the exact

cherses rade by

Perzabal before taring up the patter with the Chief IIRIiG. =

tenced to agree with 1/3 that the LIRING establishmert miche zave

arrange a confrontation with Ferzebal in the presence of teree

"Important PAR officials In texico", including a certain "Julio?

also known as "Buda". Rósulo felt that Buda could lure Ferzabal to

a private meeting sinne

the latter fear alre.dy bad inter-ered

bim some time ago and would be anxious to see himlagain. This mould

provide a food pretext for a conirontation between Perzabal a-d

IINING/3 to clear up the woole matter.

IIRING Chief, either affirmine or denyirs his knowledge of the

Ferzabel letter so that he could use this in a possible meetis ith

the latter in the presence of Fómulo and his colleagues. He said

that be felt this important in view of a possible invitation te

5. Information/Guidance Given to igent: Roston cautioned I/3 against jumping

the fun in accusire the ilinGs of inspiricy the Ferzabal letter,

po inting out that it could just as easily and logically have some

that the photo of the stost gerson corresponded te tie descriptios of the

"Pavel" he sas supposed to reet. He recalled that at the time the leon

Berrios brothers told hir they would arrange for "Favel" to contact bin

In lexico City uppa his return, they showed hin a rather poor reproduction

of a picture of Pavel that bed appeared in the local press folloving a

gunfight that Favel had had on the border while crossing into rexico.

3. Hoston then expressed Io LIRING/3 his grave reservations concerting g

the proposed tratel of I/3 to Cuaterala in the corpany of his rew Yin

Iriends. Rowton pointed out that such a trip rould be extrenely risty for

I/3 personally with little hope of any worthwhile production for zorton.

LIRIiG/3 agreed ard said that he felt he would have to contince to stall,

even at the risk of alienatire the affections and conticence o. hig.nen

contacts. Rorton suggested that I/3 tell them that before he could possibly

consider such a return trip he would bave to visit FaRtick with his mile

"everything possible" in sexico for his friends, reviewing for them bis

knowledge and experience of the border areas, his service in the navy as

well as his reasorably rood nowledge of photo-raphy.

4. Norton then stressed that IU3 should assume that everything, at least lu

Farta barrics de jeon, the nother of the León Farrios brothera (Miguel

and Jun) whos he bad originally set during his confinement in Guatenala

City. He gave the original letters, zouton's translation of vich is

attached, to Roston to copy and study. iIRi'G/3 appeared genuinely shaken

at the revlaticn in the second perezraph of the letter,dated 29/12/68,

that the "nan on the bicycle" (Ca-los Perzabal) bad wittenilo his lettr

to tarta that IIRING/3 was "workine for another coupany (*C7(E4) und toat

told Roston that he bad suspected that Perzabal dad accuéed h1s of perhaps

causing the arrest, but be never creaned that Ferzabal would! Eo so far as

to accuse bi= outright of being a scrImM agent.

2. LIRING/3 then speculated that arzabal could not bave done such a serios

chine of his own initiative, out cust recessarily have been inspired by

sore outside source, most probably tue LIRING establisment. He contizued

that he therefore felt it core necessary than ever to put the LInliG Chief

ASU LUINCUCU iS LIULNEI LEPUNI

by ROWTON, dated

28 November 1968, which the Station somehow

failed to forward.

That LIRING has forwarded information to the Mexicar

Communist Party casting suspicion on LIRIYG3's past activities

did not come as a great shock.

Heraclio ZEPEDA is known to

the Station as a previous teacher at the University of Jalapa

who said in 1960 that he would accept a teaching position in

PBRUMEN, a country he has visited on several occasions at the

invitation of irs government. ZEPEA also spent some time

in 1965 in the U.S.S.R., where he was described as Foreign

Correspondent of

La Voz de Vexico,

an official organ of the

Mexican Communist Party (see HJNA-27727, 24 Jovember 1965).

ZEPEDA apparently also visited Comsunast China.

to be well acquainted with LIRING9.

In view of the above,

the Station instructed ROWTOY to ask LIRING3 to refrain from

attempting to use ZEPEDA to obtain a "bootleg" copy of the

LIRING letter to the Mexican Communist Party.

Ine Station

feels a copy of this letter would add little

to the known fact

that LIRIYG3 is a person that LIRISG continues to view as

"suspect."

LIOSHEART has been asked for up-to-date iniorma-

tion on ZEPEDA's Party position.

Any information passed by

LIONHEART will be forwarded to Headquarters.

with the laments of the León Barrios brothers, be was really on the PBRUMEN

side and offered to do all he could to assist the-lINGs in their attempts to

assist the revolutionary forces. Ibe following is Rowton's reconstruction of

the conversation, based on IIRING/3'g report:

1/3: "I'm sorry to be late, but I had to firish the report."

I/9: Alright. I've been waiting here at the gate so there wouldn't

be any furtner delay. Let's go to my office so we can talk pri-

rat=?=."

Upon entering office, 1/9 removes jacket and offers I/3 a

seat in the

office.

IJ3: "Well, here's my rejort. I must apolorize that 1t's in rough draft

forn. I had to write it rather burriedly when my tile was not around.

It's really just a series of badly orgarized thoughts and ideas but

I'1l be glad to explain. There's a great deal more, of course, that

I could explain on the subject. Do you wish me to read it?"

Iw/9: "Fo, that's alright.

Iv9 Blances through the report and continues:

"I'Il read it carefully later. I really didn't expect such a long

report. I appreciate it. In the meantine, how are you dong in your

personal affairs??

I/3: "well, as I told you last time, I'm very such up in the ahr at the

"at

moent. My esposition has started but is not going as well as can be

expected - as well as I had hoped. You know, these things have their

ap's and down's. I'll sell sone things, at least to çover my current

expenses, but I'll really bave to got better organized linancially

In the near future. The first problem that I'm really worried about

"18 my wife, and I frankly feel that I must appeal to you for help.

J/9: "Of course, Hell, what is the problem?"

I/3: "As you sIod, sone tine ago wy wife and I had a serdés of unpleasant

situations that alzost led to a separation.."

I/9: "Is that so? I had no ideal"

I/3: "well I assumed you new, since Carmen's father 1s a close friend of

your Chiel, in any case, it's over now, and I don't expect any trouble

fro: that quarter. However, I feel that I should explain that i bave

an obligation to my wife for all that she did not me while I vas in

ja11 with no belp fron anyone, as you well know. "

I/9: "Yes, it was difficult for her."

W3: "You see, my wife is a sincere revolutionary, but she really doesn't

want any bart of the artivity that a moralutian desands

talk a great revolution, but fall apart when the chips are dova."

1/9: "Yes, we know plenty of those types."

Iv3: "well, anyway, my wife wouldn't approve of my reinvolvement and keeps

pressing ne to take a "respectable" job waich she knows I could obtain

through my friends. bat I really wnat to do is to somebow calm her down

and arrange things so that she won't have any idea of my political plans.

As you know her father 16 very 111 in New York, and she 16 anxious to

see him before he dies. I can arrange an exposition in Montreal and then

ast the father to come up to see us there. That would det around the

problem of a U.S. visa, which I'a sure neither of us could fet."

I/!: "lio. I'm sure you couldn't."

I/3: "The aly problem is transportaion. Air passage is too expensive and

unfortunately there are no boats going from bere. They all stop at New

Jork. Don't you have regular ship traffic to fontreal, so that we could

go that way?"

I/9: "Yes we do. I'n sure that could be arranged. I see no problen."

WB: " i could then kill two birds sith one stone, by stopping off at the

FDAUPON capital enroute."

I/9: " Yes, there's really co problea."

expelled Iron the party for ideological reasons, but still had a
