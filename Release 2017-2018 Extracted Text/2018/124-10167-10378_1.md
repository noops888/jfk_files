DETAILS:

On 5/18/76 Mr. August Fipp, investigator for the Standards of

Official Conduct Committee of the House, interviewed you and me in your

office concerning the Bureau's handling of the first version of the final draft

report of the HSC, which version was received by INTD on 1/20/76.

Mr. Fipp was furnished the following information, which to the

best of my recollection was the way in which this was handled by INTD.

At approximately 5 p.m. on 1/20/76 SA Dalseg received from

Douglas Marvin, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, two copies of

the draft report. SA Dalseg furnished these two copies to then Assistant

Director Wannall who in turn appointed me to coordinate the review of the

report, which consisted of approximately 340 pages, for classified material

and any errors concerning information furnished by the Bureau to the HSC.

This review was to be accomplished by 9 p.m. 1/20/76 and the results

furnished to

at CIA. Based on Mr. Wannall's instructions,

each Section Chief, INTD, was assigned approximately 50 pages to review.

SA Ryan was assigned the task of reviewing the Cointelpro portions of the

report and, as the report contained considerable information concerning the

U. S. Recording Company, the Inspection Division was requested to review

that portion of the report.

Tom Hardy, a former informant handled by

General Investigative Division, had been interviewed by the Committee.

Accordingly, General Investigative Division was requested to review that

portion of the report. As former SA Arthur Murtagh had testified before

the Committee and made a number of allegations concerning the Bureau, a

portion of the report was referred to the Finance and Personnel Division

for review.

With the short deadline imposed, five Xerox copies of the report

were made making a total of seven copies of the report in the possession of

the INTD.:. These copies were handled as follows: one copy to Mr. Adams,

one copy to Mr. Wannall; one copy to you; one copy to IS-3, INTD; one copy

Finance and Personnel Divisions.

With regard to the disposition of the seven copies, the following

is set forth: on receipt of instructions from the Department on 2/17/76

that copies of this report were to be returned to the CIA, a canvass of all

Sections and Front Office of INTD was made by SA Thomas J. McNiff, who

located three such copies. These copies were the ones furnished to Mr. Adams,

Mr. Wannall and yourself. Memorandum S. F. Phillips to Mr. Leavitt,

dated 3/1/76, captioned "Houstudy 75," contains the notation that on 3/5/76

Liaison Agent Weimar returned three copies to__

office at CIA.

At the request of Mr. Douglas Marvin of the Attorney General's

Office, we had previously furnished to him the IS-3 Section copy of the report.

SA Ryan has advised that the copy utilized by him to accomplish

the review for classification and errors was destroyed.

It is the recollection of both myself and SA R. H. Ross, IS-3 Section,

who assisted me in coordinating this matter, that the working copies broken

up and distributed to the various Sections of INTD and the other Divisions were

destroyed.

PURPOSE:

To advise that on 4/29/76 Mr. Norman McDaniels

Director See'y

(former SA), a member of the investigating staff looking into the

leak of the House Select Committee Intelligence Report, telephonically

contacted Deputy Associate Director Adams for the purpose of ob-

taining information regarding the Bureau's knowledge of the drafts o

the House Select Committee Intelligence report.

DETAILS:

On 4/29/76 Mr. Norman McDaniels (former SA), a member

of the investigating staff looking into the leak

. of the House Select Com-

mittee Intelligence Report, telephonically contacted Deputy Associate

Director Adams indicating he desired to meet with representatives of the

Bureau in an effort to determine what knowledge the Bureau had regarding

the disposition of the reports of the House Select Intelligence Committee.

After

conterring with Assistant Director Mintz it was agreed

that Deputy Assistant Director Cregar would contact McDaniels telephoni

cally and advise him that his request should be submitted in writing to the

Attorney General over the signature of the Chairman of the Committee •

looking into this matter.

This was done on the afternoon of 4/29/76

and McDaniels said that he would definitely be contacting the Attorney

General's Office but probably would do so by telephone rather than in

writing. Cregar advised McDaniels that the Bureau would take no further

action in this matter pending advice from the Attorney General's Office.

McDaniels agreed with this arrangement.

It will be recalled that on the morning of Saturday, 1/24/76,

the secretary of

the attorney hired by William Colby,

then Director of Central Intelligence Agency, telephonically contacted

Cregar in an effort to arrange delivery of the

"final report of the House

Select Intelligence Committee to the Attorney General." The secretary

indicated that the Attorney General needed the report inasmuch as the

report was to be discussed at the White House the following day and the

Attorney General's presence had been requested.
