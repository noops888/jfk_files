Dear Dave:

This is to confirm (belatedly) in writing what
I told you several months ago. On November 5, 1975, I
gave pp. 2-9 of your deposition of October 21 to
Mr. Schwarz and Mr. Smothers, with a memorandum
setting forth our agreement and your request that
Committee members be told of your concern.

Since it appears that the Senators did not
actually see your deposition, I have copied pp. 2-7
and 60-62 (which contain your final statement) and
will see that the Committee members receive them when
they are given the draft COINTELPRO report. If you

z have any objections to this, please let me know.
& ca Sincerely,

enclosing copies of a memorandum of the same date, with enclosures
reporting interviews conducted by the Senate Select Committee (SSC)
staff with Special Agent David Ryan of the Intelligence Division, FBI,
on October 16 and 21, 1975.

Enclosed for your information is a copy of an SSC letter
dated February 26, 1976, which was directed ta Special Agent David
Ryan by Miss Barbara Ann Banoff of the SSC staff, This letter was
apparently sent in accordance with an agreement made by Banoff
with Ryan that he would continue his interview relating to this
Bureau's discontinued Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros)
only if his concern regarding the preoccupation of the SSC staff in an
area of sensationalism was communicated to the Chief Counsel and
Minority Counsel of the Committee.

of the Huston Report, 7

ances
On 2/20/76, Mr. Loch Johnson, SSC Staff, verephonel ly

contacted Cregar advising that the draft report of the SSC

ion the Huston Report was completed. Johnson requested
omebody from the Bureau review the draft for accurac}.: and
or classification purposes, Contact was made with Supervisor
Paul V. Daly of the Legal Counsel Division to determine

what the ground rules were for reviewing draft reports.

After consultation with the General Counsel of the SSC,

Daly advised that the draft report had to be read in the

SSC space and that no notes describing the content.of the

report could be taken, Meo.1y é ae HE3T. Rt = a 3H

On the morning of 2/23/76 and the afternoon of
2/24/76, Cregar reviewed the narrative portions of the
draft amounting to 127 pages. No effort was made to review"
the footnotes or supportive documents to the repert

aR, 3 4978

Basically, the report engaged in a nistor ths
review of the facts leading up to the request by the President
for a meeting with Mr. Hoover and other officials "at which
time he designated Mr. Hoover chairman of an ad hoc committee
responsible for preparing a report subsequently known as
the Huston Plan, The SSC draft develops in some detail

subsequent receipt of a letter signed by Tom Charles Huston
implementing the Plan; the meeting of Mr, Hoover with then
Attorney General John Mitchell; the reaction of Attorney
General Mitchell to the Plan; and the subsequent recall of
Huston's letter by the White House,

Throughout the report, there are reflected
statements made by various senators of the SSC during
hearings of the Committee on the Huston Plan, In addition,
there are portions of testimony by former Attorney General
Mitchell, former Director of CIA Richard Helms, and former
Chief of the Counterintelligence Staff, CIA, James Angleton,
as well as the exchanges which occurred between Senator
Church and Mitchell, Helms and Angleton, Throughout the
report, there are references to Bureau officials testifying
without naming these officials. Mr. Loch Johnson agreed
that these officials would be named and identified them
as being William C. Sullivan and Charles D. Brennan.

The report highlights the fact that there was
considerable collusion between Sullivan a d_ Huston during _

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

The draft report makes the observation that,
even though the Huston Plan was recalled by the President,
certain of its recommendations were still put into effect,
namely, the continuation of a covert mail opening program
by CIA (the Hunter Program); the intensification of the
National Security Agency's monitoring of American citizens'
overseas telephone calls; the reduction by the Bureau of
the permissible age of FBI campus informants from 21 years
to 18 years and the intensification of FBI investigations
in the internal security field,

It was pointed out to Johnson that the reduction
in the age of FBI campus informants was certainly not a
violation of the law and would appear to be ludicrous to
highlight when in fact it was nothing more than an internal
change by the FBI. Johnson recognized that it did not have
\jthe same impact that CIA and NSA programs had and said he
would probably tinker with the language to recognize the
fact that the reduction of the informant's age from 21 years
to 18 was in no way a violation of any law or an impropriety
lof any kind.

NEW INFORMATION SURFACED IN THE SSC DRAFT

draft_not previously known by the Bureau_is the fact that

Yonted Dean to-attempt to reinstitute the abortive Huston

Plan; jean alleges in the dra: iat he went along with

_ Hatdeyman purely for cosmetic purposes but that he never
intended to make an effort to reinstitute the Huston Plan,

The only thing Dean agreed to was the creation of the
Intelligence Evaluation Committee with the Department.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SSC

The draft concludes with a series of recommendations,
Loch Johnson observes that most of these, if not all of the
recommendations, will probably be eliminated inasmuch as he
readily recognizes some of them are not practical and others
have been preempted by the President's new Executive Order.
However, for the benefit of the record, the following
recommendations appeared on the draft report:

(1) Any expansion of intelligence collection
operations should require (a) consultation with the agencies’,
bureaus’ or departments’ legal counsel before implementation;
(b) approval by the head of the agency as well as the Department
of Justice; (c) both the President and appropriate Committees
of Congress be informed in advance of implementation.

(2) Congress should provide guidance for agencies,
bureaus or departments in any intelligence collection operation.

(3) There should be better face-to-face coordination
between the heads of agencies, bureaus or departments.

(4) There should be monthly meetings of a Monthly
Intelligence Forum made up of representatives of the Congress,
the President, the Department of Justice and leading citizens.

(5) There should be penalties for ignoring any of
the above provisions.

(6) Each agency, bureau or department should have
within their ranks an Inspector General System.

(7) Appropriate committees of Congress should
review intelligence collection methods with the heads of the
agency, bureau or department under oath,

réquested that Unit. Chief Seymor F. Phillips be released

for a voluntary deposition concerning his knowledge of the

FBI's investigation concerning Martin Luther King, Jr., Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, Cominfil, Stanley David

Levison, and matters relating to these investigations. Epstein
noted that SA Phillips had previously been interviewed concerning
these topics but not under oath and the purpose of this request
was to place SA Phillips under oath for testimonial purposes.

By memorandum dated 8-1-75 SA Phillips was released
from his employment agreement for purposes of a staff inte tey
concerning his knowledge of the FBI's investigation concerning”
Martin Luther King, Jr. Since the topic of this particular

interview will be wider in scope, it is necessary that a“new
waiver of the employment agreement be secured.

During the prior interview of SA Phillips based
on a self-imposed restriction by the Senate Select Committee,
no information was to be given concerning information developed
through wiretaps or microphone surveillance. This was based
on discussions between Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, and Inspector John B.
Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division. On 2-24-76 the afore-
mentioned facts were brought to the attention of Michael E.
Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,
and he stated that SA Phillips could give any information
concerning these topics to the Senate Select Committee and
if they did not desire to hear the products of electronic
surveillance that that was their decision. He noted that this
self-imposed restriction by the Senate Select Committee
concerning the Martin Luther King matter was prompted by their
anticipation of entering into an agreement with attorneys of

ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

j Within the past several months newspapers in the 7
San Diego, California, area have been denouncing the as
federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI} because of allegations KR
that the FBI promoted guerrilla-type warfare against blacks
and political dissidents and the FBI's involvement with the \o
Secret Army Organization (SAO).

On January 28, 1976, Special Agent in Charge (SAC),
San Diego, furnished a copy of an article from the January 27, \\
1976, "San Diego Union” Newspaper which attributes to 7
Michael Madigan, an SSC investigator, the statement that \
“. . . his four-day visit to California has confirmed most KR
news reports about FBI. involvement with the SAO's guerrilla \
war against political dissidents in San Diego during the j
early 1970s." The news report referred to in this statement i)
includes a nine article series printed by the "San Diego ~
Union” which contains allegations of illegal conduct by the
FBI in connection with the SAO.

-@

As you are aware there have been allegations the
FBI created, financed and controlled the SAO, a now defunct
anticommunist, paramilitary organization that was headquartered
in San Diego and these allegations have been furnished to you.
Our inquiries into this matter disclosed no information indicati
these allegations are true arid by letter dated February 18, 1976.5
captioned "San Diego Operations” you were furnished results 8
of these inquiries.

On January 30, 1976, Mr. Madigan, accompanied
Mer. John T. EL1i££, Divector, Domestic Intelligence hed Oy
Force, SSC, attended a conference regarding this matter
at FBI Headquarters. Mr. Madigan admitted participating

reporter; however, the information in the news account -of
that conversation was inaccurate. Mr. Madigan stated that
this conversation took place over breakfast while in

San Diego. He indicated that he did not make the statements
attributed to him as published in the "San Diego Union."

He stated quite to the contrary that he told the reporter in
this conversation that his investigation to date had disproved
some of the allegations that had appeared in the "San Diego
Union." Mr. Madigan stated that he was upset over the
distortions and inaccurate information appearing in this
article and that he had called the editor of the "San Diego
sa hana the purpose of demanding that a retraction be
printed.

On February 2, 1976, Mr. ELLif££ advised that

- Mr. Madigan had telephonically contacted the editor of the
“San Diego Union" to protest his being misquoted. The
“San Diego Union" editor promised to retract the statements
previously attributed to Mr, Madigan on receipt of a letter
confirming the telephone call. The editor also stated that
an unspecified disciplinary action would be taken against
the reporter.

This is to advise that in a letter dated
February 2, 1976, addressed to Mr. Gerald Warren, Editor,
"San Diego Union," from Michael J. Madigan, Counsel, Senate
Select Committee, (copy attached), Mr, Madigan points out
inaccurate portions of the article that appeared in a
January 27, 1976, issue of Mr. Warren's newspaper. This
letter also contains comments reporter Dillon allegedly made
which imply he overstated his case against the FBI in his
series of articles.

The above is for information.

Dear Mr. Warren:

I was surprised to read the article entitled "Report Due” on

FBI Probe" which appeared on the front page of the San Diego Union
to me which were false. I regret to say that I feel. this inaccu~

in a brazen attempt to buttress his earlier articles about the SAO.
Specifically, Dillon's article states: : :
"Madigan said his four-day visit to California has
"confirmed most news reports about FBI involvement
with the SAO's guerrilla war against political
.-dissidents in San Diego during the early 1970's."
His article goes on to say:
. “The FBI was 'very much involved' with the Secret Army
. Organization, a Senate investigator said here yesterday
after interviewing the SAO co-founder and former FBI
informant Howard Berry Godfrey."
Both of these statements attributed to me are false. I never made _
few things I did say to Dillon were almost the opposite. More
particularly, I asked him where the evidence was for the statement
reported in his January 11, 1976 article which claimed that the FBI
“created a group knotm as the Secret Army Organization... .." 1

told Dillon that our investigation had uncovered no such evidence.

With a ‘slicepish smile, Dillon implied that he knew of no evidence’

that statement and had overstated the case. While the record

%,
of the FBI's involvemeat with its informer Godfrey does not present
a pleasant picture, I now feel compelled to state publicly that,

in my opinion, the Sin Diego Union articles by Mr. Dillon have

presented. an exaggerated picture of what really happened.- .

3 : As I indicated in my telephone conversation on January 30,

"1976 with Mr. McArthur of your newspaper, I am requesting that

you print this letter as testimony of your newspaper's sense of

fair. play, honesty and accurate reporting; a sense which your

of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States
Senate, Pages 89-101.)

The antivar movement, which began in the
United States in the 1960's, was merely a prelude to a
major struggle by Marxist-Leninist groups in this country
to build a mass movement against the Government. The
antiwar movement centered around demonstrations and was
later broadened by these groups to include a wide range
of controversial domestic issues, such as poverty, racisn,
unemployment, and foreign policy.

appendix), the antiwar movement eventually led to mass
demonstrations during the early 1970's, sponsored by two
comnunist~influenced organizations, the National Peace Action
Coalition (NPAC), and the Peoples Coalition for Peace and
Justice (PCPJ).
Historically, the New Mobilization Committee
Cus to End the War in Vietnam (NMC) or “New Mobe” had sponsored
Anon di. Gemonstrations in October, 1967, at the Pentagon, and in

Rot Major Demonstrations or Disturbances Which Occurred
in the United States Daring the Period 1965~75,
in which Nomestic Subversive Groups Played a Significant
Role

it. leaders of the MIC maintained almost constant contact
with the governments of Cuba, North Victnam, and repre~
sentatives of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.
When differences in strategy among HMC leaders occurred,

the followors of the S'P formed the NPAC, and the followers
of the CP formed the PCPJ. ‘the "New Mobe" had included

many groups, but one of the most Luential groups in it
was the Students Mobilization Committee to Gnd the War in
Vietnam (SMC). The SNC was controlled by the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA), the youth arm of tho StiP.

Tha NPAC, under the influence of the SiP, wanted

to follow a single issue, the war, and a single tactic,
massive rallies and marches. WPAC insisted, howevor, that
these be peaceful demonstrations. The PCPd, under the
influence of the cP, in addition to demonstrations, was
committed also to include issues on poverty, racism, and
repression. In addition, other tactics included civil
disobedience. The Trotskyists in WPAC did not roject the

se of civil disobedience and violence, but felt it was
premature for such actions as they would be counterproductive.

In 1971, the top leadership of PCPS included five
norbers of the CP. Similarly, leadership of the HPAC was
dominated by mombors of the SUP. In fact, four of the national
coordinators of the NPAC were affiliated with the SWP; in
addition, the RPAC stcering committee was dominated by SIP
and/or YSA members.

The first large scale antivar demonstration
organized by the NMC and SMC occurred in April, 1567,
whon 100,000 assembled in New York, and 50,000 in
San Francisco. fron that point, the nature of peaceful
demonstrations changed as depicted by the violent assault
on the Pentagon during Octobor 21-22, 1967. Phe goal of
this march which was planned by the HNC with representatives
from CP, SYP, and the SDS, was to take over the Pentagon.
Violcnt efforts wore made to smash through the guards and
enter the Pontagon.

_Re: Major Demonstrations or Disturbances Which Occurred

in the United Gtates During the Period 1965-75,
in which Domestic Subversive Groups Played a Significant
Role

The “March on the Pentagon" was followed by the
confrontation in Chicago in August, 1968, during the
Democratic National Convention, and the effort to disrupt
the Presidential Inauguration in Washington in January,
1969. The confrontation by antiwar activists at the
National Convention resulted in Chicago authorities being
challenged to maintain control of the situation, with tha
premeditated intention by HMC leaders to instigate disorder
and provoke violence.

In this regard, from September, 1969, to July, 1970,
1792 demonstrations occurred in the United States resulting
in 7561 arrests, 462 individuals injured, and including 8
deaths. Total damages were estimated to be around $10
million.

The massive demonstration on April 24, 1971,
sponsored by NPAC in coneert with worldwide dewonstrations
on that date organized by the Fourth International (FI, see
appendix) was, for the most part, peaceful with sone isolated
incidents of violence reported.

The NPAC and PCPJ received solidarity support
from foreign cormunists and joined in the spring o£ 1971,
to bring about their most massive and protracted struggle.
“he largest demonstrations ever held took place during April 24 ~
Nay 4, 1971, at Washington, D. ©. This gave the movement renewed
emphasis to “sot the date” for withdrawal from Vietnam, and to
schedule anti-U. 8. demonstrations at U. S. Embassies around the
world on July 4, 1971, in unison with communist groups in other
countries.

The organizational skill and discipline of che
Rrotskyists was clearly demonstrated by the smooth way in
which plans for action were carried out in the course of the
demonstrations on April 24, 1971. In contrast to peaceful
demonstrations on April 24, 1971, PCPd planned civil dis-
obedience during new demonstrations for the first weok of
May, 1971. PCPI called for total disruotion of tho functions
of Governnent in Washington, D. C., by delinerately blocking

transportation, tying up the telephone system and the
Wliberating* of various Government buildings. These parti-
cular demonstrations sought to bring the U. S. Covernment

to a halt, and insisted on Congress ratifying a "People's
Peace Treaty" which had been drafted in Hanoi, North Vietnam.

During the PCPS sponsored week of demonstrations,
violence became so intense that on May 3, 1971, troops were
lined shoulder-to-shoulder across Memorial Bridge and to a
lesser degree on the 14th Street Bridge leading to
Washington, D. C. Vehicles were abandoned in the middle of
gtreets attcompting to block traffic, ropes were run across
streets, and large grouos of demonstrators joincd arm-to-~arin
at intersections for the purpose of shutting down orderly
business in the city. Without Federal troops and enormous
numbers of police officers, it is clear the avowed purpose
of demonstration leaders would have been accomplished.

Ho attempt is being made to document all demonstra~-
tions which occurred throughout the United States during the
period 1965-75, however, the following is a list of some
of the major demonstrations in that period in which domestic
subversive organizations played a principal role:

During th ntght of March 6-7, 1973, two automobiles,

containing explosive devices, were recovered at the New York

City Police Department (NYCPD) Automobile Impound Lot, 12th
® ‘Avenue, New York, New York. Each of the devices was in the
7 trunk of a rental car, one of which had previously been toved

from East 43rd Street and 5th Avenuc, New York, New York, where

it had been parked illegally adjacent to the Israel Discount
Bank, The other car had previously been towed from East 47th

Street and 5th Avenue, New York, New York, where it had been

parked illegally adjacent to the First Israel Bank and Trust
Company, At approximately the same time, a third explosive
device was recovered in the trunk of a rental car parked adjacent
to the El Al Israeli Airlines warehouse facility at John F. Kennedy
Internatiohal Airport, 132nd Street and 149th Avenue, Queens,

. New York, :

The two explosive devices recovered at the NYCPD

Impound Lot each consisted of a quantity of plastic explosive

the ca® et the El Al Israel Airlines’ warehouse was of similar
construction, except that it consisted of three 5 gallon con-
-tainers of gasoline, two 20 pound tanks of propane gas, two
pachages of plastic explosive totaling over three pounds in
wefpht, and two electric blasting caps. All devices were dis-
arned by the NYCPD Bomb Squad.
, Hand-printed literature of thé Black September Or-
ganization, an Arab terrorist group, was found in all of the
automobiles. It is believed that the automobiles containing
the explosive devices were left near the Israeli establishments
sometime during the late afternoon or early evening of March 3,
1973, The explosive devices were capable of detonation but
failed to do so due to a defect in the electrical circuitry of
the devices.

Subsequent investigation by the FBI developed the
following facts concerning KHALID AL-JAWARY: _

AL-JAWARY entered the United States at Boston,
Massachusetts, from Montreal, canada, aboard Delta Airlines
flight 625 on January 12, 1873. Upon his arrival on a B-2
Wisitor's) visa issued in Beirut, Lebanon, he furnished in-
formation to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
indicating he was born July 1, 1945, in Iraq and was a citizen
of Iraq, He had in his possession Trad passport number 148151.

Bombings were the primary terrorist tactic in this
country last year, There were 89 bombings attributable to terrorist
activity in 1975, as compared with 45 in 1974 and 24 in 1973,

Six persons died in terrorist-claimed bombings in
1975 and 76 persons were injured. Five other deaths were reported
in other types of terrorist incidents. Monetary damage reported in
terrorist bombings exceeded 2,7 million dollars.

The New World Liberation Front, a revolutionary group
operating primarily in California, claimed 19 bombings in 1975, pri- :
marily targeted against a public utility. The Armed Forces of Puerto 4
Rican National Liberation (FALN) claimed 18 bombings, targeted 5
against Government and corporate targets, especially banks, in New York
City, Chicago, and Washington, D, C. -

FALN

The Armed Forces of Puerto Rican National Liberation,
or FALN, took credit for the most serious terrorist bombing reported
in 1975: the explosion which claimed four lives on January 24 at the
Fraunces Tavern in New York City. The group claimed a total of 18
bombings and one attempted bombing in 1975,

The capabilities of the FALN were also illustrated by.
the simultaneously coordinated attacks against ''Yanki government and -
monopoly capitalist institutions" in New York, Chicago, and Washington,
D. C., on October 27, 1975, the "first anniversary of our existence as

_ an organization" in the words of the FALN communique issued in i
connection with these bombings. (The group's first claimed bombings--~
against five corporate and banking targets--took place October 26, 1974).

cereyeer ees

Half of the FALN-claimed bombings took place in New York *
in 1975, and half were directed against banks. Weekends or Mondays
before business hours were the time of three-fourths of FALN bombings.
The group has demanded independence for Puerto Rico and freedom for ©
five Puerto Rican "political prisoners," nationalists convicted of attacks
on President Truman and the U. S. House of Representatives in the 1950's.

NWLF

The New World Liberation Front (NWLF) claimed 19
bombings and ongattempted bombing in 1975; all but one of these took
place in California, A primary target of this group has been the property
of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The NWLF has not shown any
time pattern in their attacks, but have consistently carried out actions
almost every month of the past year.

While previous NWLF actions have attacked targets con-
nected with international issues, i.e., hotels leased by a multinational
corporation in protest of alleged corporate actions abroad, recent attacks
have focused on local issues, Besides demanding cuts in local utility
rates for individuals, as opposed to businesses, recent communiques
have concerned "poor people's health" and actions of San Francisco city’
government. Credit has been taken in NWLF communiques for four
recent automobile bombings in San Francisco, aimed at police.
WEATHER UNDERGROUND
SEETESEEETERIESTEETETE. S Self-déscribed "guerrilla organization" of "communist
women and men, underground in the United States" claimed three bombings,
and one attempt, in 1975, The first Weather Underground (WU) bombing,
on January 29, was against the State Department in Washington, D, C. —
At the same time, another WU-claimed bomb failed to go off at a Depart-
ment of Defense facility in Oakland, California.

On June 16, the group claimed the bombing of New York
City bank and on September 5, a bombing that caused $150, 000 damage at
the Kennecott Copper Building in Salt Lake City was claimed by the WU.
This bomb had been placed in a ladies' room; the State Department bomb
had also been placed in a wall with access from a ladies' room.

WU published four issues of its newsletter, Osawatomie,
in 1975, and its aboveground support arm, Prairie Fire Organizing
Committee, also issued a publication, Groundswell. The group demanded;
"Stop U. S. aid to the junta in Chile" in the communique claiming the Salt
Lake City bombing and each issue of Osawatomie has said of the Bicentennial:
"The rulers have set the time for the party; let us bring the fireworks."

Four other revolutionary-type groups claimed significant
bombing activities in 1975, Safeway grocery stores have been the targets
of two groups. The George Jackson Brigade claimed four bombings in

Washington State, half against Safeway. ‘The Emiliano Zapata Unit (EZU)
took credit for three Safeway bombings (and one Bank of America bombing)
in the San Francisco area since the end of October, 1975. One EZU
eommunique spoke of children suffering from malnutrition and threatened:
“We Will kill to protect our children."

The Red Guerrilla Family claimed three bombings in
California in March, April, and July, targeting Government in two cases,
In Denver, Colorado, the Continental Revolutionary Army (CRA) took
eredit for four bombings in 1975 against primarily Government targets.
The last CRA communique attacked U.S. activities abroad--in Panama,
- Chile, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and North Viemam,

Black Liberation Army (BLA) activity in 1975 was limited
to four escape attempts. A major portion of the group is incarcerated
for the numerous attacks on police and bank robberies that have been
linked to the BLA since 1971. One of these jailbreak attempts, on May 25
tm New York City, resulted in the death of a BLA member when his bed-
sheet rope broke during a ten-story descent to the ground,

imvolved in this incident and had escaped. :

Timing devices and other bomb components were found in

American Indian Movement (AIM) leader Dennis Banks has
said, on December 16, 1974, ina Sacramento, California, television

Another ATM leader Vernon Bellecourt, said ina March 15, 1973, speech j

ae SECRET

We have at this moment no specific reported information
that international terrorist groups will target the Bicentennial celebrations
for a terrorist actx However, many of the groups and organizations cur-
rently of investigative interest to the Bureau have made veiled threats concerning
terrorism during Bicentennial celebrations. Domestic groups such as the
Peoples Bicentennial Commission; the American Indian Movement; the
Weather Underground and other revolutionary "New Left" type groups
have threatened actions to disrupt the celebrations, Foreign-inspired q
or financed groups such as the Palestine liberation movement, the Puerto \
Rican independence groups, as well as South and Central American liberation |
organizations have reportedly talked about disrupting the Bicentennial by ]
acts of terrorism, Past experience has shown that it is events such as the
Bicentennial, which are the focus of worldwide attention, that have become
the target of the international terrorist in order to obtain maximum notoriety \
for their cause. In connection with the Bicentennial, there will be numerous
foreign dignitaries and heads of state visiting the United States and any group,
whether domestic or foreign which feels that it has a "cause" against that
particular individual, could strike while that dignitary or head of state was

- in the United States. For example, the Queen of England will visit the
United States early July, 1976, and a terrorist group such as the Irish
Republican Army (TRA) which has not committed any terrorist acts in the
United States to date could conceivably target the Queen for assassination
or attempt kidnapping while she was in the United States. We must remember
that terrorism is theatre and what better stage than an attack during the
Bicentennial celebrations, our election year, or the Olympics in Canada.

The Puerto Rican independence groups have shown by their
bombing of historic Fraunces Tavern in New York City that they are com-
mitted to terrorist acts against sites holding historic value to the United
States. It has been reported many of the Puerto Rican terrorists have been
trained in Cuba and receive substantial aid for their terrorist acts from that
country. As, once again, relations have cooled between the United States

- and Cuba, it can be expected Cuba will not act as a restraining agent to
prevent further acts of terrorism by their trained Puerto Rican terrorists
in the United States,

Of prime concern also during the Bicentennial is the form-
ing of a new Arab terrorist group made up of elements from the "Rejection
Front" and headed by the international notorious terrorist "Carlos" true
name Ilich Ramirez Sanchez. This new group is reportedly backed by both @S)

~4-

L



a. SECRET

Libya and Algeria and its targets are Western Government leaders.
Prior terrorist acts in which Sanchez has been connected with have
always been on éhe spectacular side, i.e. (OPEC), and the events
during the Bicentennial offer a perfect stage. &

Other groups of the Palestine liberation movement,
such as Al Fatah and its terrorist wing, the Black September Organi-
zation, have ceased international terrorist operations since the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) has received observer status at the UN, ;
This, of course, is no guarantee that these terrorist organizations will |
not resume international terrorist operations if they feel that a political i
ia solution cannot be achieved at the UN. () ;

The Jewish Defense League (JDL) has apparently
embarked once again on a systematic terrorist binge directed at those
countries in the UN who voted for the resolution equating Zionism with
racism, The JDL readily reflects the feelings of the Israeli Govern-
ment in the United States. Any decision reached by international bodies,
such as the UN, which adversely affect Israel becomes the JDL's cause,
and they strike out on behalf of Israel against the countries voting for
the adverse action against Israel. Thus far, there have been ten incidents
involving ten different missions to the UN. These have been rock throwing
incidents, intrusion onto mission property, one bombing and attempted
bombings at missions and at the UN itself. A member of the JDL in
November, 1974, on public television openly threatened the life of Yasir
Arafat, the leader of the PLO. Arab establishments in the United States
and Arab diplomats continue to be targets of the JDL.

7 Other terrorist groups such as the Japanese Red Army
and the anti-Castro elements within the United States, have proven by
their actions that they are a credible threat against dignitaries who
might visit the United States during Bicentennial activities. The IRA
has engaged in terrorist operations in Britain, breaking away from the
traditional urban guerrilla warfare they had engaged in in Northern
’ Ireland by adopting the terrorist weapon of bombings, hoping to cause
hysteria in major cities within Britain. Individuals connected with j
anti-Castro groups in the United States have engaged in numerous {
attempted and actual bombings of Cuban establishments throughout \
North and South America. They have engaged in mail and book bombs j
directed to Cuban establishments, as well as the bombing of banking © j
| institutions and other commercial firms which deal with Cuba. |

Under Public Law 92-539, the "Act for the Protection
of Foreign Officials and Official Guests of the United States, the FBI
has investigated approximately 900 incidents. These incidents range
from the mugging of an Ambassador's wife to the armed takeover of a
foreign embassy. They also include such things as the harassment of
a foreign Consular official by telephone and the bombing of a foreign
mission to the United Nations.

Public Law 92-539 provides for concurrent jurisdiction
between the FBI and local police departments, The facts of any violation
are immediately presented to the U. S. Attorney for his opinion as to
whether FBI investigation is warranted. As a general rule, the U. S.
Attorney will authorize FBI investigation only when the violation is a
yaajor one and when there are aspects of foreign policy to be considered.

One example of a major PFO violation investigated by
the FBI is the attempted bombing of the United Nations, Five sticks
of dynamite were found in the United Nations on August 7, 1974, by a
United Nations security guard. Even though the Secretary General of
the United Nations refused to allow the FBI to enter United Nations grounds,
the case was solved and one Michael Halsey Brown, a member of the
American Nazi Party, was convicted under the Protection of Foreign
Officials statute and sentenced to 25 years in the custody of the Attorney
General,

Another example-is the armed takeover of the Philippine
Embassy. On November 18, 1974, Napoleon Bayaga Lechoco, armed
with a firearm, took over the Philippine Chancery, Washington, D. C,
Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez and Attache Mario S. Lagdameo
were taken as hostages, but remainder of Embassy personnel escaped.

The FBI immediately responded to the scene and took
overall charge of the efforts to neutralize the situation, following receipt
of the U. S. Attorney's opinion that a Federal investigative presence was
warranted, FBI contingency plans developed for such a situation were
utilized, ;

At approximately 2:00 a.m., November 19, 1974,‘
subject surrendered to FBI Agents.

On June 25, 1975, Lechoco was found guilty on seven
counts including violations of the Act for the Protection of Foreign Officials,
He was later sentenced to ten years in the custody of the Attorney General.

SOCIALIST WORKERS PARTY

The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is a
revolutionary, Trotskyist-communist organization, which
is headquartered in New York City. Its purpose, as
stated in its Declaration of Principles, is the overthrow
of the U.S. Gevernment and the institution of a dictatorship
of the working class and the eventual achievement of a
communist society. It was founded in 1938 and maintains
close association with international Trotskyist organizations
as a "'sympathizing" group, but it denies formal membership
in any foreign group to escape application of the Voorhis
Act, which regulates certain types of organizations subject
to foreign control. While the SWP does not openly advocate
the use of violence at the present time to overthrow the
U.S. Government, it believes that eventual violent revolution
in the U.S, is inevitable. Its objection to the current
use of violence is based on the ground that it believes
violence is premature at this time. The SWP seeks to
precipitate qa revolution when conditions are ripe and to
seize control of the revolution and to direct it when it
eccurs.

Represematives, Congress found the existence of a world
commtinist revolutionary movement, whose purpose is to
establish a communist totalitarian dictatorship in the

ia world's countries through the medium of a world-wide com- |

This finding was upheld by the United States Supreme Court +
in June, 1961. The CPUSA has continued to be an arm,of the

The CPUSA, in its dependence on the Soviet Union, has pever

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY/
“WORXER STUDENT ALLIANCE, Formerly
Known as § ents for a Democratic Society

:
Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) came into 3
existence in June, 1962, and for the remainder of that ‘ q
decade functioned as the leading New Left campus-based
student organization in the U.S. From an initial posture
of "participatory democracy," SDS moved toward Marxist-
Leninist ideological predomination with debate centering
on how best to creaté a revolutionary youth movement.
During 1968-1969, internal factionalism developed within
SDS resulting in a split in June, 1969, into three
‘organizations: Weatherman; Worker Student Alliance (WSA);
and Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM). Weatherman and
RYM are no longer affiliated with SDS, however, WSA continues
to use the name SDS.

At the 1970 SDS/WSA National Convention, a
confrontation occurred between Progressive Labor Party-(PLP)
{a Marxist-Leninist organization advocating violent overthrow
of the Government) oriented leadership and various caucuses
opposed to PLP domination. The resulting struggle left the
PLP- oriented leadership in complete control of SDS/WSA, which
was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

PLP control of SDS/WSA continued until February, ced
1974, when the Boston chapter of PLP split from PLP National 4

Headquarters and formed Party for Workers Power (PHP) (a i
“yevolutionary communist" organization advocating the violent | 4
overthrow cf the government by the workers). SDS/WSA is now. q
fragmented into two groups, one which supports PWP policy

headquartered in bridge, Massachusetts, and the much a
larger group which supports PLP policy jheadquartered in

PROGRESSIVE LABOR PARTY

The Progressive Labor Party (PLP), which was
founded in 1965, adopted a constitution which “resolved to
wo build a revolutionary movement" and "build a socialist USA
with all power in the hands of the working people." PLP
followed the Chinese communist line for several years but
became critical of Chinese leaders for establishing a dialogue
with the U.S. following President Nixon's visit -to China in
1972. Thereafter, PLP declared itself to be an independent
Marxist-Leninist organization ained at setting up a dictator-
Ship of the working class. According to Milton Rosen, National
Chairman, the PLP advocates violent overthrow of the Government,
but has set no timetable for its overthrow. The PLP, which
vis headquartered in New York City, has chapters in more than
QS citics’in the U.S., and has, in the past ycoar, initaatsd
efforts to make PLP "an international party with the aim of
rebuilding a new revolutionary communist movement."

In 1972, the PLP organized the Workers Action

U. S. Senate Select Committee
te Study Governmental Operations
With Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSC)

The matter of documenting Levison's CPUSA membership
has been addressed in prior SSC requests, and FBI responses
thereto. For example, in response to an SSC request dated
November 7, 1975, FBI memorandum dated November 20, 1975,
brought to notice the highly sensitive oral briefing furnished
to Senator Church and selected members of the SSC Staff by FBI
personnel on November 5, 1975, It was stated that this briefing
was intended, in part, to serve in lieu of any written informa-
tion in response to SSC requests for commmications documenting
Levison as a secret member of the CPUSA.

The FBI memorandum dated February 6, 1976, responding
to the other Items in the January 23, 1976, request, also
elucidates on FBI documentation supporting the reported CPUSA
membership of Levison,

Once again, we are reiterating our position, which
remains unchanged, that our briefing of Senator Church and
selected SSC Staff Members was sufficiently candid and
informative to have resolved any doubt as to Levison's communist
background, including hismembership in the CPUSA. As those
who were briefed are fully aware, this Bureau, at considerable
risk to the security, personal and otherwise, of several
individuals, "walked the extra mile” with the Committee.
Security considerations, personal and otherwise, are still
paramount. In good conscience, we are unable to be more
informative in this matter which the Committee continues to
pursue, ~

1 - The Attorney General

NOTE:

: Shaheen's advise as to modification of Item 3 was to
Supervisor S, F, Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project. The matter
of utmost sensitivity involved here concerns our highest level
coverage of the CPUSA,

In regards to my interview with Mark Epstein from Senator

I am no longer sure as to the exact dates but as
best as I can remember it was on July 17,1975 that I received
a call from Paul Avery who is a reporter for the San Francisco
Chronicle, Paul asked me if I would object to being interviewed
| by’ an investigator from Senator Church's committee, I ‘told
- him that I had no reason not to talk to anyone from any committee _

and told Paul to have him give me a call.

i he was Mark Epstein called me and said he was from Senator i
“Church's committee and that Paul Avery had given him my name . a PEE
cand ‘phone number

He ee a meeting on that very day as he had to

4xeturn to Washington that evening. I told him he could come

He arrived at my house at about 2:00 PM and stayed until i

i

favout 5:00 PM. He asked me to give him a full description of my

tactivities with the F.2.I. and the Weather Underground. I started
“€rom the beginning and as the stary unfolded he interrupted as he
tdesired additional information. ~

q As the interview progressed, I became-aware that the only
time he interrupted me was when he tho.ght he had discovered
F some mistake the F.B.I. had possibly mauc. «

A good example of this is in regards to the Detroit

Police Officer's Association bombing plot. This was the only
r bombing pict that I was involved in while I was with the
i Weathermen and Mr. Epstein found it very interesting, He :

was mainly interested in what the F.B.I. had said and done in pasmeact
| regards to my activities in this plot. What was the F.B.I. :
‘:going to do when the time_came to actually place the bomb, he
-asked over and over again. Since Bill Ayers had told me to
i forget the DPOA bombing and go to Medison,- Wisconsin instead,

I could not accurately answer his question as my part in the
{ptot came to an end before the bemb was to be placed. I did
Mtremember that Carl O'Gara, who was the F.B.I. agent that I was ‘
in contact with in Detroit at the time, had told me to be very i
Mteareful as to what part I tock in the planning, and under no
| «circumstances was I to initiate any action.

nA mere mm RARE SE

Mr. Epstein found this a little difficult to believe
or at least that is what he said. The entire interview went _
rithis way until Mr. Epstein felt that he had heard enough.

i

As he was leaving, he toid me that he did not expect that
ithe committee would ask me to testify. Upon hearing this T
, jasked why, was there any problem? Mr. Epstein replied, “weil:
#: you xeally do not have very much bad to say about the F.B.I.,
Know do you"? No, I suppose not was my answer to this statement
and I repeated as I had throughout the entire interview that
‘'mever once during my association with the F.B.I. was I asked
to do anything illegal, quite the contrary if anything the
-Bureau was constantly reminding me to be extremely careful of
iwhat I did and said, so as not to instigate anything.

7 Mr. Epstein left telling me that he would be in touch

<iwith me in about two weeks. After waiting for his call for

5 about a month I decided to cali him at which time he informed

me that a decision had not been made in regards to my testimony.
XI called him on several different occasions and he was never there,

Fk and never returned my calls.

After reading about the testimony that the ex- aa
‘Klu-Klux-Klan informer gave ebout F.B.I. activities in the
‘south I realized that the probable reason that I was not
fealled was because Senator Church's. committee found somebody
that had nothing but bad things to say about the F.B.I.

4 I hope this :vill be helpful to you and your impending

jstruggle to maintain the F.B.I.'s integrity. I do not believe
tthat Senator Church's committee is as unbiased as they would like
Beople to believe and as I can erstand where the over zealiousness
sof individual agents could cause mistakes to be made that does

znot. necessarily mean that the entire F.B.I. is guilty.

Sincerely yours,

I talked to Special Agent Jack Baker, of the San Francisco t
A.

Pield Office, yesterday. He told me of your request to show re
letter that I wrote to you, concerning the Church Committee.

have no objection to you using that letter in any way that — may
deem necessary.

I sent that information to you, with the hope that it would
in some way help in your struggle to maintain the F.B.I.'s integ-
rity. If Senator Church and his Committee are really trying
establish reasonable guide lines for F.B.I. activities, then
effort should have been made to present the correct as well
incorrect methods that are employed to gather intelligence
mation. I feel that my experience with the F.B.I. qualifies me!tu
Say something about the correct methods that were used in mg case,
and why the Church Committee chose to ignore me is a little diffi-
cult to understand.

-I would like to add that it is my belief that if the intelli-_
gence community is greatly weakened, at this crucial time, the
terrorist problem is going to grow accordingly. Mistakes may have
been made in the past but this does not negate the fact that the
acts of terrorism, in this country, have increased tremendously
in the last few years and will continue to do so if little or nothing

: ds done to put a stop to it. I believe that my experience with the
Weathermen qualifies me to, speak, out on this issue as well. "

- sROK

As you have said, Mr. Kelley, "the American people are ae ae |

to have to decide which they fear the most, the F.B.I. or the 4978

terrorist." There are many organizations, in the United States

today, that advocate the violent overthrow of our Government.

that it does not.

This is to record transmittal of certain documents to the
Senate Select Committee (SSC) by the Department of Justice.

BACKGROUND

By SSC letter to the Attorney General (AG) dated 2/4/76
(copy attached), a request was made for certain documents which th
Department of Justice recently made available to the attorneys for

the plaintiffs in a pending civil action entitled "Iberia Hampton, et al.,
v. Edward Hanrahan, et al. (U.S. D.C., N. D., Dlinois),"

As current and former personnel of the Chicago Office
of the FBI are named as defendants in the civil action, the question
arose as to whether or not these documents could be released to the
SSC, Subsequent contact with the U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago
determined that the documents had been made available to the plain-
tiffs' attorneys and were not rotective court order.
EEG PNT oe a0
Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel for Intelli-. :
gence Coordination, Department of Justice, telephonically advised
on 2/9/76 that the Department had ruled that the documents could be
‘urnished to the SSC. Consequently, copies of the documents were
/’ forwarded to FBIHQ by Chicago airtel 2/13/76 (copy attached} ga cecum

Memorandum to Mr. W. O, Cregar
Re: Senstudy 75
62- 116395

On 2/18/76, Blackhurst telephonically advised of proce-
dure to be used in transmitting these documents to the SSC. He said
that they are technically Justice Department documents as Assistant
U. S, Attorney Arnold Kanter, who is defending FBI personnel, has
possession of the documents and is in control of them. Blackhurst
said he would take possession of the documents, write the transmittal
letter to the SSC, and the AG would be responsible for the security of
the documents.

On 2/19/76, Danny Coulson of the Legal Counsel Division
made the documents available to Blackhurst for review and forward-
ing. They were transmitted to the SSC by Blackhurst letter dated
2/19/76 (copy attached).

Copies of these documents are being maintained in the
Project Senstudy Unit.

ACTION:

None. For record purposes.

RESPONDING TO CRITICISM Training

Telephone

O By rec es

The report of the Senate Select Committee on’ fAtelli-
gence (Church Committee) is reportedly to be completed and
released approximately March 15th. We have already been
provided with a number of documents which the Church Committee
intends to publish in connection with its forthcoming report.
As expected, these documents clearly indicate that the Bureau,
A Aly

will be in for substantial criticism. It can be expected Nii
the report will be released with the usual hoopla and with
appropriate media exposure.

It is the feeling of the External Affairs Divisio:
that after almost a year of intensive investigation and
resultant publicity that the American public are tired of
listening to the same old faces making the same old accusagéion
It is felt that steps should be taken to prepare for the felease
of the Church Committee report and have information available
which can be provided to the field and media contacts of the
External Affairs Division countering the criticism of the Church —~
Committee report. It can be readily expected that the COINTELPRO XN
and the alleged harassment of Martin Luther King, as well as the
use of informants, will be the principal areas of criticism.

The External Affairs Division feels that representatives
of the Intelligence Division and the External Affairs Division
should begin’ immediately to review the aforementioned critical
areas in order to adequately es 8 CELL. o the 5 [Uhh

While the forthcoming Senate Select Committee report
may be expected to be highly critical of past alleged FBI abuses,
we do not anticipate it will include many, if any, new revelations,
Numerous memoranda, position papers, and briefing materials
have been prepared regarding past areas of criticism, While it
is not believed feasible to prepare additional general briefing
material in anticipation of the release of the report, Intelligence
Division is available to brief External Affairs relating to specific
areas of past criticism and to promptly respond to any new allega-
tions resulting from the report.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

Chief Counsel Frederick A. 0. Schwartz - During
discussion concerning Bureau investigation of
domestic organizations, Mr. Schwartz requested
a list of readily available major demonstrations .
in this country for which domestic subversive
organizations were responsible.

OBSERVATIONS :

A copy of the now defunct "Attorney General's
Subversive List" has been obtained by the Senstudy Project
Unit. Regarding the list of major disturbances for which
domestic subversive organizations were responsible,
although no date was set, it is believed that such a list
covering the years 1965- 1975 would be responsive to the
request of Mr, Schwartz.

: It is believed preferable that the above-requested
material be obtained or prepared by the sections of the
Intelligence Division listed below and responsive material
forwarded to the Senstudy Project Unit for inclusion in

one cover communication directed to the Attorney General
for referral to the SSC.

RECOMMENDATIONS :
1. That the IS-1 Section prepare and send to
the Senstudy Unit an appropriate reply to Senator Morgan's

request for information concerning alleged payments made
“ this Bureau to George F. Dorsett. dah as ant fel

Direcior

Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, D.C. 20535

Dear Kelley:

I am in receipt of your letter of January 30, 1976 in which you
referred to my comments before the Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce..
It is sad for me to tell you that the statements attributed to me are
substantially what I said to the Chamber. I am convinced, after
personally observing countless FBI documents as a member of the S
Select Committee on Intelligence, and after observing some of tho:

directed to the FBI, that the Bureau does constitute a serious
to the individual liberties of American citizens.

I doubt that anyone can read of the many actions of lawlessness
committed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the last decade;
of the unwarranted domestic surveillance, bugging, and wiretapping,
without concluding that the Bureau is not far from being in the same
condition it was in when Attorney General Harlan Stone reorganized it
in the 20's. In addition, Mr. Kelley, I have seen very little in the
actions of the top echelon of the Bureau to indicate to me that there
is any real change in the philosophy of those who direct it. The usual
response to the mention of the actions of wrongdoing has Be in the

nature of, "We have made some mistakes in the past..." or, "We were wrong,
but..." SETHY

ReCsO 9.2 Lo FZS UND.

In your letter you state, "Understandably, such sentiments are most
disturbing to my associates and to me." As one who had been an ardent-*
admirer of Mr. Hoover and the Bureau, for many years, the sentiments are
disturbing to me also. They are, however , the direct result of reading
the Bureau's own documents and of hearing the testimony of Bureau officials
before the Select Committee.

The Honorable Clarence M. Kelley
February 2, 1976
Page Two

I, as you well know, have a long history in the field of law
enforcement. The State Bureau of Investigation, under my direction as
Attorney General of North Carolina, performed excellently as the State's
primary law enforcement agency. It is my hope that the Federal Bureau
of Investigation can, in the near future, regain its status as a highly
respected law enforcement agency. This can only be accomplished by the
Bureau's free admission that, for whatever reason, it has placed itself
above the law in the past on occasions too numerous to mention and by
its active willingness to work with the American people through their
elected representatives in Congress to bring to light and to correct those
abuses of the past.

The Domestic Subcommittee of the Select Committee, on which I serve,
is now in the process of completing its inquiry into past FBI activities
and preparing legislation and guidelines to govern future FBI activities.
If you feel that you can be of assistance to me in performing my duties on
the Subcommittee I will be glad to meet with you and discuss your ideas at
a time convenient to us both.

Sincerely yours,

_

Section 2 states the purposes of the bill: to
establish a new standing. committee of the Senate, the Com-
FE
8

ittee on Intelligence Activities, to oversee and to make
ontinuing studies of the intelligence activities and pro-
rams of the United States Government.

Section 15 defines "intelligence activities" to
mean, among other things, activities taken to counter activi-
ties directed against the United States such as the collec-
tion, analysis, production, dissemination, or use of infor-
mation affecting the relations of the United States with any
foreign government or related group; covert or clandestine
activities affecting the relations of the United States with
any foreign government or related group; and "the collection,
analysis, production, dissemination, or use of information
about activities of persons within the United States... .who
pose, or may be considered by any department, agency,
bureau...of the United States to pose a threat to the secu-
rity of the United States, and covert or clandestine activi-
ties directed against such persons."

Sections 4 through 12 of the bill would be enacted
as an exercise in the rulemaking power of the Senate. Thus,
it would be within the power of the Senate, once the bill is
enacted, to amend Sections 4 through 12 without the consent
of either the House of Representatives or the President of
the United States.

Sections. 13 through 17 would have the force and
effect of a statute.

Section 4 provides that the Committee would be
composed of nine members. Regardless of the political com-
position of the Senate, five members would be appointed by
the majority leader and four by the minority leader. No
member of the Committee would be permitted to serve on the
Committee more than six years.

Subsection 5(a) would give to the Committee exclu-
sive jurisdiction over all legislation and other matters re-
lating to the Central Intelligence Agency,. the Director of
Central Intelligence, and authorizations for appropriations
for, among other things, the intelligence activities of the
FBI, "including all activities of the Domestic Intelligence
Division (sic) ."

This same subsection would grant to the Committee
concurrent jurisdiction with other standing committees, which
now have such jurisdiction, for intelligence activities of,
among others, the Department of Justice, and the organization
or reorganization of any governmental agency relating to
intelligence activities.

Subsection 5(b) would prohibit one Senator serving
as chairman of the Intelligence Committee and another Senate
Committee at the same time.

Section 6 would require the Committee to report
to the Senate on the nature and extent of governmental in-
telligence activities, and to report, when appropriate, to
ees committees. The Committee would be required to proceed
"in such manner as will protect national security."

Section 7 would prohibit disclosure of information
about intelligence activities by any member or employee of
the Committee except in closed session of the Senate, unless
the disclosure was authorized by the Committee.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo

Re: INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1976
$.2893
94TH CONGRESS, 2ND SESSION

A single Committee member, however, is. entitled
under Senate Rule 35, to request a closed session of the
Senate in which he may disclose to the Senate any informa-
tion of any kind. He may. use a closed session to request
that the full Senate overrule a Committee decision concern-
ing public disclosure.

Section 8 pertains to the Committee staff. It
would limit staff employment to six years, and require a
staff employee to agree to be bound during and after em-
|pioynene by the rules of the Senate and other committees
ith respect to the security of classified information. It
also would require an employee to receive an appropriate
security clearance.

Section 9 would require the Committee to formulate
rules to prevent the disclosure of information which would
violate a person's. constitutional rights or privacy. This
requirement would not prevent the Committee from publicly
disclosing information if it determined the national in-
terest "clearly outweighs" any infringement of the privacy
of any person.

Section 10 deseribes the procedures for the dis-
closure of information in the Committee's possession. The
Committee could disclose any information if it determines the
mational interest would be served by the disclosure.

In any case in which the Committee were to. decide
to disclose any information which the President requested be’
kept secret, the Committee would be required to notify the
President of its intention and it could not disclose the in-
formation for ten days. If the President, prior to the dis-
closure, were to certify in writing that the disclosure would
threaten the national security, and if the Committee were to
decide to refer the question of disclosure to the Senate, the
information could not be disclosed unless the full Senate
were to agree to do so, or the Senate were to refer the matter
back to the Committee and the Committee thereafter were to
_approve the disclosure.

Re: INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1976
$.2893
94TH CONGRESS, 2ND SESSION

If the question of disclosure were to be referred
to the Senate by the Committee, the Senate would be required
to. vote on the matter within three days. 7

Ultimate authority to decide what information should
be disclosed thus would rest with the Committee, except that,
as noted, a member of the Committee would have the right under
Senate Rule 35 to request a secret session of the full Senate
and to move that the full Senate overrule a decision of the
Committee.

Section 11 would authorize the Committee to permit
a personal representative of the President to serve as a
liaison to the Committee and to attend closed meetings.

Section 12 provides that all materials now in the
|eustoay of the Senate Select Committee would be transferred
to the new Committee.

As mentioned above, Sections 4 through 12, if the
bill is enacted, could be amended by the Senate acting alone,
since these sections would be enacted as an exercise in the
rulemaking power of the Senate.

Subsection 13(a) would impose upon the head of each
intelligence agency an affirmative duty to keep the Committee
"fully and currently informed with respect to intelligence
activites" of his agency.

Subsection 13(b) would make it the duty of the head
of each intelligence agency "to furnish any information or
document in its possession, custody, or control, or witness
in its. employ, whenever requested by the Committee. .." with
respect to any matter within the Committee's jurisdiction.

This duty, if imposed, would give to the Committee,
its staff, or an agency working at the Committee's. direction,
such as the General Accounting Office, unreserved, unlimited,
total, and complete access to FBI information and documents.

‘o mention is made, for example, of the head of the agency
aving authority to withhold the identity of a confidential
source of information.

Legal Counsel to Adams Memo

Re: INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT ACT OF 1976
$.2893
94TH CONGRESS, 2ND SESSION

It is not clear from reading this subsection whether
the duty which would be imposed would require the furnishing
of information or documents in the possession of a "witness
in [fhe agency's/ employ," or whether the duty would be to
furnish to the Committee a "witness in /the agency's/ employ."
In view of the unlimited access to information and documents
granted by this subsection, the proper interpretation of this
phrase is of no moment.

Subsection 11(c) would prohibit covert or clandes-
tine activities in foreign countries in peace time without
prior notice to the Committee.

Section 14 would require annual authorization for
appropriations for the intelligence activities of, among
others, the FBI, “including all activities of the Domestic
Intelligence Division (sic), or its successor.

- Perhaps a word is in order about what the bill
would not do. It would not create a joint House-Senate
committee; it would not reduce the number of committees
having oversight jurisdiction over the FBI; it would not
establish penalties for unauthorized disclosure of informa-
tion; it would not require prior notice before engaging
lin specific acts, although the authorization for appropria-
ition section (Section 14) could result in nearly the same
thing; and it would not apply to criminal intelligence unless
lit were to be determined by the Attorney General or the
Director that. criminals pose or are considered to pose a
threat to the security of the United States. (Differentiating
between the various species of intelligence is beyond the
scope of this memorandum.)

What_would the bill do? It would create a new
standing committeé of the Senate; it would add one to the
number of committees with some oversight jurisdiction over
the FBI; it would grant total access to FBI documents and
information - access unprecedented even during the investi-
gations by the Senate and House Select Committees; it would

give one Senate Committee the authority to disclose sensitive

providing us with an itemization of the incidents to which
Mr. Adams was referring.

I assume that all underlying materials pertaining to
each of these incidents have been previously supplied to
the Committee. However, in the event that that is not
the case, I would appreciate your forwarding copies of such
materials as soon as possible.

Your cooperation is appreciated.
