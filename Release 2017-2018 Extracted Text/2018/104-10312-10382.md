In his assignment with Project ENDOMORPH in |_ Subject was a
source of constant embarrassment in his contacts with police
officials. He was boastful, indiscreet, lacking in sound judgment, knew
little or nothing in the fields in which he was self-professedly an expert
and was guilty of security breaches in failing to maintain his cover.

In one incident he made recommendations of police reorganizations to be
made by province governors in whereas, in the Police
Department is a national organization and not subjec “the dictates of
the province governors. This caused mich 1]1 will and friction with the
police.

Subject professed to be an expert in his knowledge of the polygraph
machine and claimed he had two years' experience with the Los Angeles
Police Department prior to his employment with the Agency. However, it
was developed that instead of this claimed experience, he had actually
spent one or two weeks in a detective school connected with the Los Angeles
Police Department where he received below average grades.

type of technical equipment and this conversation led to the disclosure
by Subject that he was employed by the ‘Agency .in a covert capacity; that
he was teaching lie detection techniques to foreign police departments
without being authorized or competent to do so. Subject was briefed in
December 1952 with stress placed on the importance of living up to his
security responsibilities and_exercising utmost precaution in protecting
the covert interests of the “Agency:

In spite of the strong warnings given him in this interview, Subject
again became involved in an incident of official embarrassment to the Agency.

In March 1953 he misrepresented himself as a polygraph operator with the

“State Department Secret Police". This misrepresentation was mada at a
time when the Department of State was not authorized to have a polygraph
machine and Congressional legislation was pending at the time regarding
such authorization. As a result of this misrepresentation, Subject waa
afforded another security interview in March 1953. He expleined that

his cover company sold equipment to foreign countries through the Mutual
Aid Program and supplied consultant services to the State Department but
Subject denied that he ever represented himself as a State Department
operator. After the security interview Subject was also assessed
psychologiat (March 1953) and was found to be egotistical,
unstable, possessed of a need to build himself up in the

eyes of others and gave either exaggerated or completely erroneous
information as to his past positions. His intelligence quotient was found
to be comparatively low in relation to those of other Agent]; employees.
