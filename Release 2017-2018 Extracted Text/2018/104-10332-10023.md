Mr. John R. Tunheim

Chair, Assassination Records

Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC 20530

Re: JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992

Dear Mr. Tunheim:

This will respond to your 14 September 1998 letter regarding

Central Intelligence Agency compliance with the "JFK Act."

I have no doubt whatsoever that the CIA has fully met its

obligations to locate, review, and release "assassination

records" as defined in the JFK Act.

The Agency's 2 September

1998 Declaration of Compliance-signed, as you note, by CIA's •

Director of Information Management, Edmund Cohen-confirms my

judgment. I have full confidence in the scope of the Agency's

searches as described in Mr. Cohen's recent declaration.

As

Director of

Information Management, Mr. Cohen is directly

responsible for CIA's records systems and for ensuring the

adeguacy of CIA's search,

review, and release of documents under

the JFK Act. Mr. Cohen

signed the Agency's Declaration of

Compliance because he was the most senior Agency official with

direct personal knowledge that its statements were accurate and

complete. There was no more appropriate signatory.

In sum, I understand that the appropriate CIA staff officers

have worked diligently to locate and disclose to the JFK Board

all relevant records in the Agency's possession and that they do

not believe any other relevant records are being withheld from

the Board. Mr. Cohen's declaration confirms my understanding.

I trust that this will meet your requirements.

Sincerely,

Goof Catt

George J. Tenet

Universe and Scope of CIA Documents

Addressed Related to the JFK Assassination

Summary. This Attachment discusses CIA material

examined in order to fulfill the requirements of the JFK

Assassinations Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act) .

It

addresses the types of CIA documents found in the records of

earlier investigations, including that of the House Select

Committee on Assassinations, and materials and files

recovered

in response to searches conducted in 1992 and

thereafter. It discusses the process by which documents

became "assassination-related records."

Discussion.

The Central Intelligence Agency has

provided large numbers of documents and materials over the

years in support of successive reviews and investigations

related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

We estimate that the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages

comprise the "CIA collection" of documents associated with

prior

assassination reviews, including duplicates. In

addition, we estimate that in responses to the JFK Act, CIA

has reviewed over 100,000 pages of documents from the

National Archives, the Ford, Johnson, and Kennedy

Presidential Libraries and miscellaneous papers from the

National Security Council, the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), the Rockefeller

Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States, and

the Senate Select (Church) Committee to Study Governmental

Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.

The documentation exists in many forms, from original

contemporaneous material, such as field reporting from

overseas or analytic reports, to material generated

specifically as an Agency response to investigation

questions.

The largest "CIA collection," as such, is

associated with

the records of the House Select Committee on

• -=

Assassinations (HSCA).* The HSCA brought together in one

place in 1978 the principal documents retrieved over the

course of years from

earlier investigations, including the

Warren Commission, the Rockefeller Commission, and the

Church Committee.

The Warren Commission in 1963 and 1964 was the first

major review of the JFK Assassination. Existing records

suggest that CIA provided roughly 4,000 pages of

documentation to the Warren Commission review, plus

testimony by Richard Helms and John McCone.

The Warren

Commission pursued matters related primarily to events and

actions directly associated with the assassination event,

including materials from CIA's Mexico City Station, which

were considered relevant because of a visit to Mexico City

by Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the assassination.

The Rockefeller Commission in 1975 and Church Committee

investigation in 1975 and 1976 were focused on allegations

of wrongdoing by the CIA. Nonetheless, as a part of these

investigations they yielded information which, to many,

appeared to relate in some way

•to the assassination, such as

an operational capability or willingness to consider

assassination as an intelligence method.

From 1976 through 1979 the House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA) pursued additional leads, generating

still further documentation. The HSCA ultimately brought

together within its broad scope of investigation many of the

documents from the Warren Commission, the Rockefeller

Commission and the Church Committee.

This collection

ultimately became the "HSCA sequestered collection," which

altogether contains an equivalent of over 300,000 pages, in

paper, photographs, tapes, and microfilm media, including

duplicates.

Because the myriad conspiracy theories included

possible Soviet, Cuban, Mafia or right-wing American

involvement, the scope of the HSCA investigation included

anything or anyone that might appear to support those

theories, including historical institutional behavior

Further, although this sequestered collection was

considered to be CIA's, it contains documents from other

agencies, primarily the Federal Bureau of Investigation

(FBI) and over 30,000 pages of HSCA originated material.

The HSCA sequestered collection reflects the major corpus of CIA material or

information reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (or to

which they had access) during the 1976-1979 time frame.

The pulling together

of this collection was coordinated by the Committee and they defined what it was

This Collection has been physically held by CIA since 1979,

2

## Page 12

14-00000

The HSCA sequestered collection is contained in 64

boxes of multimedia material, including paper, photographs,

and microfilm which have been loosely organized into major

categories of information. Boxes 1 through 34 are mostly

material collected by the CIA's Directorate of Operations,

the FBI, and other Government agencies, including field

reporting and handwritten notes.

They also include

newspaper articles, name traces performed in response to

requests by the HSCA staff, and copies of other documents

such as the CIA Inspector General's 1967 report on CIA plots

against Castro and Richard Helms' executive session

testimony before the HSCA.

Boxes 35 through 63 of this collection are largely

records of CIA's Legislative Counsel, Inspector General,

General Counsel, Office of Security, and Directorate of

Science and Technology, as well as internal records of the

HSCA staff. They consist of reports, memoranda,

transcripts, cables, letters, newspaper clippings,

photographs, and charts. Box 64 contains 72 reels of

microfilm-the equivalent of roughly 72 more boxes of paper

documents.

This material includes the file which the

Directorate of Operations maintained on Lee Harvey Oswald

(the 201 file) as well as similar files on additional

individuals.

other documents in the other boxes! documents duplicate

While not a part of the sequestered collection, a

separate "Oswald 201 File" has served as a CIA repository

for JFK assassination-related material over the years and to

a large extent material in this file is duplicative of

material in the sequestered collection. Only a few

documents were in the file at the time of the assassination.

The bulk of the approximately 26,000 pages currently in this

file consists of documents collected immediately after the

assassination and during the Warren Commission

investigation. Included are a large number of third agency

documents, primarily from the FBI. Other major additions to

the Oswald 201 file include relevant Mexico City Station

files and material generated by various FOIA requests and

investigations, such as that of New Orleans District

Attorney, James Garrison.

Assassination-related materials beyond the sequestered

collection and the Oswald 201 file which have been located

since 1992 generally fall into three categories. First,

there are new documents which have been generated since

1978, such as defector reports that mention rumors or

perceptions of conspiracies or newspaper or other open

source materials related to an individual associated with

the assassination.

Second, in a number of cases targeted

areas of inquiry or more precise definitions of areas of

interest by the JFK Board have yielded more information and

added documents to the collection. And third, improved

search techniques have provided better access to those files

which are searchable electronically. Nonetheless, the

material located since 1992 is quite small when compared to

the material in the sequestered collection and the overall

set of material from CIA which has been designated as

"assassination

records" by the JFK Board.

In accordance with the law, the Board has the authority

to designate records which it considers relevant to the

assassination as

"Assassination Records."

are then subject to review for declassification or, as

deened appropriate by the Board, held for declassification

in the year 2017.

The Board has designated the entire

sequestered collection as Assassination Records as well as

selected material generated in the course of searches

subsequent to 1992. The entire set of these documents is

the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages, including

duplicates.

ATTACEMENT II.

Search MethodologY and Types of Searches Conducted

Summary

This Attachment discusses the methodologies

used in conducting the searches, including what we know of

the searches which were conducted on behalf of the earlier

assassination investigations. It includes, in referenced

cabs,

documentation of selected taskings. It discusses the

distributed nature of CIA's paper recordkeeping systems and

electronic databases and the custom keyword searches that

are used with electronic databases which CIA maintains.

Discussion.

The collection of CIA materials contained

in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

"sequestered collection" has existed as a discrete body of

records since 1978. This material resulted from highly

labor intensive and systematic searches by individuals

familiar with the Agency's paper files and records systems

Today, the sequestered

collection comprises the great bulk of CIA-originated

documents which can be associated with the JFK Assassination

and related investigations.

For most of its history, the Agency has had a system of

records which has been shaped by the divergent requirements

of the directorates in accordance with the wide variance of

focus in their missions. These basic differences in the

missions of the directorates, as well as the compartmental-

ization-of-information procedures (the "need-to-know."

concept), have resulted in each directorate keeping its own

set of records in accordance with directorate-specific

guidelines. This applies equally to paper records as well

as to electronic databases.

Since the late 1970s, the Agency has been in the

process of converting to electronic databases, which allow

for electronic searches for documents using keyword and

2 Even within a single database, information may--in accordance with information

compartmentalization requirements based on the need-to-know principle--be stored

in

separate files by

several offices or divisions, each with its distinct

recordkeeping criteria and access requirements.

In order for a search to be

thorough,

a search for one term or a combination of terms must be conducted

across

all such files.

---

## Page 16

14-00000

other indexing tools which provide much more expedited and

efficient searches.

Because the most significant portion of

JFK assassination-related material was generated prior to

this conversion to electronic databases, searches of the

sequestered collection or other contemporaneous CIA records

have had to rely primarily upon labor intensive hand

searches.

Since 1992 and the passage of the JFK Act, CIA has, in

responding to the requests of the Board, had to devise

search methodologies and techniques to address both the hard

copy and electronic versions of our databases. With respect

to the hard copy material, Agency efforts have concentrated

on those component records most likely to yield

assassination-related documents. Short of a complete manual

review of all documents in the

Agency, the techniques used

for searching hard copy materials include expert reviews of

file series and folder names, including associations with

known related topics, retrieving boxes of files from the

Agency's Archives and Records Center, and manually reviewing

those files identified as likely to contain the sought after

materials.

Electronic files searches can actually be more complex

than manual searches, in major part because of the number of

different electronic

systems in use.

The Directorate of

Operations' electronic databases, for instance, include most

cables since 1978 and they can be searched using single or

multiple search terms against the full text of these cables.

The Directorate of Intelligence's automated systems include

original source material used for analytic assessments as

well as the products themselves and can be searched through

a variety of electronic techniques. The DCI Area

(considered, for this purpose a directorate) maintains the

Executive Registry files which are not normally retrievable

any nearne the

through full text search, but by index searches. The

Directorate of Administration maintains a large and diverse

system of databases and files on employees and contractors

that includes data on

security issues, medical records,

training, etc.

The Directorate of Science and Technology

and its subordinate components maintain other electronic

databases unique to individual missions.

systems requires a unique set of access

criteria and search

commands and must be searched by information management

experts of the respective directorates.

Where possible, automated systems were searched using

key words such as JFK, Kennedy, assassination, executive

action, Oswald, place names, and a large number of names,

crypts, or pseudonyms identifying individuals known to have

2

been associated with countries, key installations,

organizations, or operations that fell within the period

deemed relevant to the history of the assassination.

The following categories are examples of the guidelines

for relevancy with which both manual and computerized

searches were conducted.

They include, but are not limited

to, individuals, organizations, places, projects,

and

subjects which are considered central to the Oswald/JFK

assassination history and the ensuing investigations.

A. JFK Assassination Investigations:

• Warren Commission, 1963-64

• James Garrison, New Orleans District Attorney, 1966-68

• Rockefeller Commission, 1975 (JFK assassination & CIA

anti-Cuban plots aspects only)

• Church Committee (Senate), 1975-76 (JFK assassination &

CIA anti-Cuban plots aspects only)

• House Select Committee On Assassinations (HSCA) ,

1976-79

B.

Key Subjects:

• Moscow Station, Mexico City Station, and JMWAVE

Station, as they related to Oswald's activities or

to possible conspiracies.

• KGB interest in Oswald.

• CIA anti-Cuban operations 1960-64 if they involve

JFK figures or subjects; most US anti-Castro

activities in 1963 are considered relevant.

• Cuban exile anti-Castro activities, leaders, and

organizations, 1960-64, if they involve JFK figures

or subjects.

• Castro assassination activities (plans and attempts)

without limit on time frame.

• Mafia, if related to Castro, JFK, or New Orleans

during Oswald time frames.

Key Figures: Material with the following terms was

considered JFK assassination-relevant unless the

context is clearly not related or the information is

outside the appropriate time period:

• AMLASH

• AMMUG

• Maurice Bishop (any reference)

• Silvia. Duran

Prior to enactment of the JFK Act, in early 1992, the

Chief of the CIA History Staff, through various manual

searches of shelf lists, located the

"sequestered

collection" of the House Select Committee on Assassinations

(sixty-four record center size boxes). After obtaining the

permission of the Congress, his staff

surveyed these and

other related holdings on the assassination. In addition,

the History Staff located sixteen boxes of Lee Harvey

Oswald's 201 file and a number of loose folders, mainly from

Mexico City Station records that had been collected for the

Warren Commission.

In October 1993, following enactment of the JEK Act but

prior to the President's appointment of the Board, CIA's

Historical Review Group (HRG) requested the directorates to

conduct a name search on Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK

assassination, and any related documents (Tab 1). This

request resulted in a series of meetings and discussions

with various Agency components and Information Release

Officers.

More than thirty-one additional boxes of

materials were sent to HRG for review.

Included in this

material were nineteen boxes of JFK working files of Mr.

Russ

Holmes, a CIA employee who for many years was the

Agency's focal point officer with responsibility for

responding to questions related to our assassinated-related

records. Also included were

two boxes on Nosenko, seven

boxes of Latin America Division documents, and three boxes

from the Bay of Pigs project. Out of these thirty-one

additional boxes provided to the Board staff, approximately

twenty-two boxes of material were designated by the Board as

assassination records.

The preponderant volume of these

records is duplicative of documents in the sequestered

collection.

In April 1995, after the Agency received the Board's

first formal request, and in anticipation of "what are

4

---

## Page 19

likely to be many requests from the Board for information.."

the Agency Executive Director asked each directorate and the

DCI Administrative Officer to appoint a focal point officer

for the JFK Assassination review. (Tab 2)

In the spring and summer of 1997, the Agency arranged

for the Board staff to receive a series of briefings by

representatives of each directorate on the files kept within

the records systems of each directorate. These briefings

covered aspects of the records systems, such as how the

records are organized, maintained, searched and retrieved,

as well as how they had been previously searched for

assassination-related materials.

The Board staff requested a number of additional

searches, which have now been completed. These requests

were both formal and informal and resulted in responses to

the Board staff which included a wide range of additional

material, some of which was judged relevant to the history

of the assassination.

This material includes the histories

various CIA operations

and Agency components, files on

specific individuals involved in either the Warren

Commission or in HSCA investigations, and the results of CIA

internal reviews of programs and operations. Although many

requests from the Board and responses from the Agency were

handled informally, the significant initial requests are

listed in the table in Attachment V.

Prompted in part by the surfacing of a small number of

new relevant documents, the Board staff requested CIA in the

summer of 1998 to: (a) perform an additional set of searches

on certain specific topics; and (b) issue an Agency-wide

notice reminding CIA employees of the requirements of the

JFK ACt.

Specially tailored tasking was sent to the three

Directorate of Operations components deemed most likely to

possess records relevant to the JFK assassination of the

kind of concern to the Board (See Tab 3) .

Among other

considerations, this special tasking included a list of new

or revised search terms, a request for clarification on the

disposition of the James Angleton files, and the requirement

to focus on potential new information from the debriefing of

defectors in which any reference to Oswald or to the Kennedy

assassination occurs.

DCI Tenet issued an Agency-wide Employees Bulletin on

22 July 1998 directing all CIA personnel to "consider

documents in their possession or with which they are

5

## Page 20

-$55

familiar that might have relevance to the Board's review..."

(EB OIM 98-02-See Tab 4) .

Finally, and in a separate tasking, all directorates

were asked to assure that searches undertaken were

sufficient to enable a directorate representative to provide

a certification of compliance with the JEK Act, and that the

DCI's Bulletin had been

forwarded to all directorate

employees. (See Tab 5).

surfaced within the past few montha, the Board has also

requested specific focus on renewed searches of the Agency's

"counterintelligence files." The new documente have

surfaced due to a variety of reasons, including references

to assassination related personalities in recent detector

reports, recoras made available because of the break up ot

the Soviet Union, and advances in search capabilities due to

digitization of

older paper files.

FINAL DOCUMENT SEARCH TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH "PRESIDENT JOHN

F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992" (JFK ACT)

FROM:

George J. Tenet

Director of Central Intelligence

1.

(U) As you know, the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (Board) is completing

its task of overseeing the search and declassification of all Federal government records relating to

the assassination of President John F. Kennedy by 30 September 1998. The Board and we want

to do everything possible to place before the American people the full story as reflected in

goverment and other records.

2.

(U) The Agency has been working on this effort since 1992 and has searched all of the

obvious databases. We want to make certain that we have left no stone unturned and that no

employee has any records that might possibly be considered relevant to the assassination—

including any records created [or received] after 1992. The reference to 1992 is largely intended

to encompass documents which may have come into our hands since the collapse of the Soviet

Union and Warsaw Pact.

(AIUO) In accordance with the provisions of the JFK Act, I hereby direct all CIA

personnel to consider documents in their possession or with which they are familiar that might

have relevance to the Board's review and that might not have been found in the course of

electronic or manual searches over the past six years. Representatives of the Historical Review

Program believe that if such documents do exist they would, most likely, be found in files that

would not be generally related to the assassination or that would not be "logical" areas for

systematic searches. These include working paper files or smaller databases related to countries

not normally associated with the assassination. Relevant documents can be in the form of papers,

photographs, recordings, tapes, or other media, and can include documents "related to the

assassination," such as later investigations, key topics/events within the Oswald/JFK Story, or

material related to key figures such as Nosenko.

Attachment III

Records Declassified and Released.

Summary

This Attachment discusses the process used by

CIA to declassify JFK assassination-related documents,

including interaction with the Board and subsequent re-

reviews of materials, as well as the personnel resources

engaged in this effort. It discusses the volumes of records

reviewed, the volumes of records declassified, and the

manner in which the material has or will be made available

which the mass to

Discussion. In response to the enactment of the JEK

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 and in

anticipation of the appointment of the Review Board, CIA,

during 1992 and 1993, reviewed for declassification material

which had been sequestered following the investigation of

the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1978.

As a result of this effort, CIA released as declassified to

the National Archives in August 1993 some 127,000 pages of

material

from this collection.

Since that time, additional

releases have been made; approximately 74,000 pages from the

microfilm part of the collection were declassified and

released in August 1994 and 30,000 pages of HSCA originated

material were declassified and

released in 1995. We

estimate that, since 1992, CIA has devoted over 100 work

years to its effort to respond to the JFK Act (including

experienced annuitants working as independent contractors).

The development of the declassification review

methodology was, from the beginning in 1992, an iterative

process that took into account both the requirements of the

JFK Act to release to the public information relevant to an

understanding of the assassination and the DCI's statutory

mandate to protect intelligence sources and methods under

the National Security Act of 1947 and the CIA Act of 1949.

In the years since 1992, considerable effort has been

expended to balancing these two objectives. Interaction

with the Board's staff was a significant factor in reaching

this proper balance. The net result is that practices over

this period evolved to the extent that types of material

that had been redacted at the beginning of the process were,

by the end, no longer considered necessary to withhold.

This has, of course, required a further re-review of the

material released during the earlier period to assure that

---

## Page 36

14-00000

consistent standards were being used for the entire

collection.

Each document in the collection was read by an

Historical Review Program (HRP) Reviewer -- in every case a

retired officer with at least two decades of Agency

experience

-- who examined every word in the document with

an eye toward releasing documents unless such release could

be expected to cause damage to:

• Human intelligence assets or their families;

• Intelligence

methodology clearly requiring continued

protection;

• Intelligence operations or activities warranting

continued protection, including relationships with

foreign governments.

The reviewed documents were then passed to teams of

officers from the components that generated the documents

(in most cases the Directorate of Operations), who were

responsible for determining current sensitivity.

The senior

HRP reviewers validated

the component groups' actions prior

to forwarding the materials to the Board.

Names of CIA employees who served all or most of their

careers under cover posed particular problems and, while

many names have been redacted, with Board concurrence for

release at a later date, the current sensitivity, or lack

thereof, of retired individuals' employment by CIA had to be

checked in each case. Names of key players in the post-

assassination scenario, as stipulated by the Board, were

released as true names or with temporary and traceable

substitute names.

Identification by the Board of those who

were considered key players was a complicated and time-

consuming task. Significant review and analysis went into

the decision to release true names of many Cubans connected

with the Bay of Pigs.

Material from the Rockefeller Commission and Church

Committee investigations, presidential libraries and PFIAB

files which addressed the entire scope of CIA activities

raised issues with respect to relevance to the JFK

assassination. For example, Project MONGOOSE, a clandestine

portion of the publicly acknowledged U.s. anti-Castro

policy, was released.

Another major issue was consistency in reviewing

duplicate copies of documents.

In one case 47 copies of a

cable were found by different reviewers in separate files

---

## Page 37

14-00000

over the six years of our review process.

The National

Archives ground rules called for release of every copy for

inclusion in the NARA collection; therefore, each of these

47 copies is included

as part of the total collection.

As

duplicate copies were

found, comparison with the 1993

released version revealed not only inconsistencies but

textual phrasing which,

in a mosaic of related documents,

made likely the identification of a protected individual or

action. As a result, much re-review of the files was

required and did occur.

Another time-consumer was the question of the

identification of overseas station locations, traditionally

not revealed--both to protect Agency individuals, activities

and sources and to avoid foreign relations difficulties with

foreign governments. In these cases, a window of time for

acknowledgment of such facilities was negotiated, directly

relevant to such actions as Oswald's travels and post-

assassination requests for foreign government assistance in

the U.s. investigation.

Except for redaction of names of CIA employees, true

names of clandestine agents (otherwise identified with

traceable cryptonyms), and currently-sensitive cooperation

with specific foreign intelligence services, the final

collection in the National Archives will contain very

limited redactions and, in our opinion, none that would

affect an historian's understanding of the Agency's

information on, and relevance to, the event.

ATTACHMENT IV.

Perceived Gaps in CIA Records

Summary•

This Attachment addresses the Board's

requested explanation for the apparent absence of files

which are known to have existed (or for which there is some

evidence that they existed at one time) but cannot now be

naxated at one Enon

located.

Specifically, the Board asked for such information

on the following: Oswald files; certain files of James

Angleton; DCI McCone files; William Pawley; and Win Scott.

This Attachment also

addresses

the Board's request that the

Agency's Declaration "

...identify any other records relating

to Oswald or the assassination that CIA knows to have been

destroyed or removed from CIA files."

Discussion.

Files on Lee Harvey Oswald

(a)

The Office of Security (OS) maintained a pre-

assassination subject file on Oswald. This file contained

newspaper articles and reports from other government

agencies. As would be expected, the number of volumes of

the subject file grew following

the assassination. The pre-

assassination material remained in volume one and subsequent

material was

filed in volumes numbered II through vI.

However, during a February 1997 search, no volume V was

found.

A second thorough search of the OS file system

tailed to produce any record ot Volume V.

A careful page-

by-page review of the contents of the existing volumes

revealed there is no time gap in the material. Therefore,

it is believed the label on Volume VI is simply incorrect;

it should have been labeled Volume v.

The OS Oswald subject file was reviewed by the HSCA in

1978; however, it was not stored with the rest of the

sequestered material.

There is no documentation on why this

file was not incorporated into the sequestered collection

held by the

DO; eight boxes of non-Oswald OS files were in

the collection. The Oswald Security File has been reviewed,

declassified, and released to NARA.

(b)

There has been considerable interest over the years in

locating any electronic surveillance tapes that would have

been made during the period that Oswald visited Mexico (26

September - 2 October 1963). A thorough search has been

conducted of the DO's record system as well as the index to

retired records in an attempt to locate any tapes and/or

find documentation to resolve their disposition.

We have

discussed this issue with operational experts and their

---

## Page 40

professional opinion is that most likely such tapes were

never returned to Headquarters for retention.

It was normal

practice to recycle audio tapes after they had been listened

to by transcribers and their transcripts made.

Messages between field stations and headquarters used

operational jargon and shortened sentence structures that

can sometimes allow for misinterpretations.

Thus, possible

confusion was created when references to what was being sent

to headquarters referred to "tapes" but really intend

"information" from tapes.

In our search efforts we did locate approximately 185

audio surveillance tapes of the Cuban and Soviet embassies

in Mexico City that were recorded during the immediate time

following the assassination

1964).

(22 November 1963 to January

The fact that these tapes were retained and returned

to Headquarters could account for the fact that some people

recall that some tapes existed which were sent to

Headquarters.

Based upon the search efforts that were undertaken and

the opinions of operational experts consulted, CIA has

concluded that the tapes in question do not exist and were

almost certainly recycled in the normal course of business

before their potential value was identified.

James J. Angleton (Chief, CounterIntelligence Staff, 1954-

1974)

As noted in a 24 August 1998 memo to the Board, the

files of Mr. Angleton were incorporated within the files of

the CI Staff and the Directorate of Operations.

Three

memoranda, dated 23 November 1976, 5 August 1977, and 29

November 1979, detail the review and incorporation into

the DO Central Records System of the Angleton files as well

as all the files found in CI Staff following Mr. Angleton's

departure.

As a result of this review and incorporation of

files, there is no identifiable collection of Angleton

files.

The three memoranda mentioned above have been

included in the Agency's JFK collection for processing and

release to NARA.

John McCone (Director of Central Intelligence, 1961-1965)

Within the McCone papers are several file folders with

notations that indicate documents are missing.

However,

each folder has an index of the documents that were

originally within it. Of all the missing documents only two

refer to the Kennedy assassination.

One document is

described as "Date of Meeting - 26

Nov; Participants - DCI &

2

assassination." The second document is described as

• "Date

Participants - DCI, J.J. McCloy;

Dinner at Residence

- Re: Oswald. (The latter is annotated:

"Destroyed 1-28-72."]

Both documents were noted as missing when the files

reviewed by the CIA History Staff in November 1986.

William Pawley (Industrialist; friend of DCI Dulles and

supporter of Anti-Castro activities)

The JEK collection contains a 201 file on Mr. Pawley

that ends in 1962. The Directorate of Operations determined

that material through 1965 that should have been in the 201

File was filed in an operational file. Most of the material

was already within the JFK collection. The Board staff

reviewed all the documents within the operational file and

selected additional documents for inclusion in the JFK

collection. This material will be processed for release to

NARA.

Win Scott (Chief of Station, Mexico City, 1956-1969)

The Agency's Retired Record Table (RRT) shows Mr.

Scott's Mexico City files were retired as Job 78-00594R on

11 August 1972. These records were retired to the Agency's

Archives and Records Center under Item Number 40-76 in the

DO Records Control Schedule in effect at that time. Files

under Item Number 40-76 were described as:

"Temporary. Destroy upon completion of a specific job

or as they serve their purpose.

Return folders and

documents on loan and destroy remaining papers."

The RRT shows Job 78-00594R was destroyed on 12 January.

1987, based upon reference to Item Number 40-76 of the

Records Control Schedule.

The RRT page showing the disposition of Mr. Scott's

files and the page of the Records Control Schedule which

describes Item Number 40-76 have been incorporated in the

Agency's JFK collection and will be processed for release to

NARA.

Certain Station Files

Within the Board's guidance for CIA's compliance

The

The Church and Pike Committees both expressed concern

about HTLINGUAL, a mail opening project which held

As a result of these

of 1992 mandates a number of specific actions on behalf of

government departments

and agencies.

One of these is

to:

"...make available to the Review Board any

additional information and records

that

the Review Board has reason to believe it

requires for conducting a review under

this Act." (Sec. 5(c)2 H.)

In the exercise of this authority under the Act, the Board

made fifty-three specific requests for additional records

and information in the form of sixteen (16) requests

designated

as "formal" and thirty-seven (37) designated as

"informal."

On each request, the CIA worked closely with

the Board and Board staff to provide the information and/or

documents requested and a written response which records

such actions.

Discussion.

As a part of this Final Declaration, the

CIA has attached at Tab 1 a list of the fifty-three requests

by number and a

short description of the subject of each.

At the Board's request this attachment includes at Tab 2

the

specific response to the request numbered CIA-16 (Oswald

Pre-Assassination File)

Beyond the fifty-three requests, the Board raised two

additional matters which tend to fall within the category of

special requests:

1) A request that the Agency review and declassify the

Board's interviews of former CIA officer and Mexico City

station employee, Anne Goodpasture; the Agency's response to

that request is complete.

2) A request for Board staff access to sealed

Rockefeller Commission records held by the Library of

Congress; these records were given to the Library by

Rockefeller via

a deed of gift which requires a letter from

the DCI before access can be granted. This letter will be

completed by 9 September 1998.

DI. T. Jeremy Gunn

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board

600 E. Street, N.W. (2nd Floor)

Washington, D.C.

20530

Dear Dr. Gunn:

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records

No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files) and

No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)

This is a partial response to the ARRB's referent

request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had

on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is believed the following comments

and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of

Security questions. The DO response is pending.

1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum

containing information from the Agency's Office of Personnel

Security which provides details about the files it had on

Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they .

were created.

These include the Office of Security file on

Oswald, a general file on Americans who had defected to

another country and information about HTLINGUAL files.

2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977

memorandum from the

Office of Personal Security which

explains the numbering of that Office's file on Oswald. In

particular, it explains why the "missing" volume V may never

have existed..

3.

An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald

Security file and the file on American defectors.

4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and

those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRE

•staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will

according to current release guidelines.

If you have any questions about this response, please

advise.

Sincerelv.

22 December 1997

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

1. Pursuant to ARRB "Resquet No. CIA-16, the Office of

Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre-

assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald.

The following

responses are provided to those questions which pertain to

the Office of Personnel Security (OPS) •

the best reasonable answers based on available information.

Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to

1 October 1994.

Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as

possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time

of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: At the time of the assassination, the Office

of Security (OS) held two files which contained information

on Lee Harvey Oswald. One file entitled "Defectors File"

(#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and

the second

I file was Office of Security subject file on Lee

Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in

the automated security database known as the Management Data

Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were

originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the

above numbers circa 1964.

A hand search was also conducted

of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated

system.

This hand search produced the same results as the

automated search of MDP/PS.

2.

Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an

HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official

files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),

#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of

the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along

with numerous soft files.

Since

this material has been

destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files

contalned

any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search

of Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any

of these files. Attached is all of the available

information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL

files.

This information was retrieved from the Information

Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review

of general office administrative files.

!

Question 2: For other than the 201-289248 file on

Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the

purpose for the opening of the file, and the documents

that

were in the file at the time of the

assassination.

Response:

As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been

destroyed.

'Since OS files are usually set up in

chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in

close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL waS

undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening

dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826

#0090079

#0093466

#0119144

Opened approximately July 1952

Opened approximately February 1953

Opened approximately July 1953

Opened approximately May 1955

3. HTLINGUAL was

a Directorate of Operations project

involving the opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to

and from the Soviet Union,

and South

America.

In the Office of Security this project was known

as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER,

INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER. The Office of Security actually

conducted the opening and monitoring of mail with the

acquired information being referred to the Directorate of

Operations.

4. The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa

1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens

defecting to other countries and information regarding

foreign nationals considering defection to the United States.

This file contained information was from press clippings,

Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal Bureau of

Peder

Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed

services.

The pre-assassination documents located in this

file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959

entitled "u.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at

15"

Department of State memorandum dated 25 October

1960 with attached list of American "defectors"

5.

The index reference to the Defectors File

identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as

the Defector Machine Listing.

This listing was a computer

printout of defectors

and provided limited biographic data

on each name.

This listing was maintained separately from

the actual Defectors

File; notations within the Defectors

File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently

charged to the Security Analysis Group of the Office of

Security. Efforts to locate this listing or determine its

disposition have been unsuccessful.

Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors

File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.

An employee of this Office was, recalls the Defector Machine

Listing as being approximately one and one-half inches thick

and in two parts. One part consisted of an alphabe second

part listed the assigned numbers in numerical

order and

contained the limited biographic data on each name.

7.

The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald

(#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file

was created as a separate repository for the numerous press

vas create as

clippings and reports received from other government

agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR

and his activities following his return to the United

States. The first volume of this file appears to have been

preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents

contained in this file are as follows:

a. Department of State telegram #1304 from Moscow

dated 31 October 1959

b. The Washington Post press clipping dated

Question 4: To the extent that Counterintelligence

and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination

files on Oswald, please explain why those offices

maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.

In answering this question, please make appropriate

references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)

and to any other materials (including organizational

charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and

organization reasons for which CI and OS would have

maintained such files.

Response: It is believed that OS holdings on tee

Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during

which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in

contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the

Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the

Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution

of these reports.

In the beginning this material was

probably retained in the Defectors File.

As the number of

5

## Page 62

documents increased, a separate file was created to be the

repository of information on

the alleged American defector.

There is

a notation in the Defectors File that a separate

file exists on Oswald.

9. Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of

Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.

Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-

assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a

majority of them contain a notation or the initials of

Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the

te for the collection.

officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing

of this information.

10. The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the

component responsible for collecting, developing, and

evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to

detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency's

organization, employees, and activities by foreign or

domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted

research in connection with employee loyalty cases and

maintained records identifying personalities, environments,

and personal traits of individuals who had been of

counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained

liaison with various

government agencies in connection with

counterintelligence activities and coordinated the

counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using

organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported

directly to the office of the Director of

Security.

11. A representataive of the Office of Personnel

Security /Management Staff was queried regarding the mission

and functions of SRS during the pre-assassination time

period. He made inquiries relating to the above request.

and the OPS/Information Management Officer retrieved retired

policy records for review.

The information on the mission

and function of SRS was

retrieved from the archived Office

of Security administrative and historical files as well as a

review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

FROM:

Chief, Information Management Branch

Office of Personnel Security

SUBJECT: OSWALD, LEE HARVEY

AIN: 0351164

The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31

January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center for the Study

of Intelligence (HRG/CSI), via the Directorate of

Administration/Information Review Office, with researching pre-

assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was.

generated by the John F. Kennedy Board's desire to review and

declassify relevant material. The results of this review were

forwarded to the HRG/CSI on 27 February 1997.

2.

During the Information Management Branch's

(IMB) research in response to the above tasking it was noted that

Volume V of the Oswald files was not on the shelf where Volumes

I-IV and VI-VII were located. A search of the entire area where

the volumes had been maintained failed to locate Volume V. The

IMB Files Section was subsequently charged with conducting an

all out search for the missing volume. The search failed to find

Volume V.

3.

In July 1997, the Oswald files were reviewed page by

page prior to being turned over to HRG/CSI and another attempt

was made to locate Volume V or to locate persons who might know

what happened to it. Volume V was not located nor were any

persons located who were knowledgeable of its status.

During the complete review of the Oswald files no

time gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall

ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume v

had been consolidated into other volumes or that Volume V never

existed, but that a numbering error resulted in what should have

been Volume V being labeled as Volume VI. The use of Roman

numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this

error to occur.

DO Response to Board Request CIA - 16

Oswald Pre-Assassination Files

The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO

ecords to determine if there were any additional file.

containing pre-assassination records relating to

Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald

201 which appeared to be a file inventory.

document identified CI Staff as the file custodian.

CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were

incorporated into the 201.

Prior to establishing a 201, any documents received

would have been placed in an operational interest file.

We found no reference to the existence of an

operational file.

If such a file had existed, however,

it might not have been registered in the central index.

It was standard procedures that upon opening a 201, the

documents from an interest file would be transferred to

the 201.

Given that Oswald was a subject of the HTLINGUAL

operation, it is reasonable to believe that there was a

file on him. We destroyed all of the HILINGUAL files

under court order, and no record was made of what files

existed.

We did not review all of the DO record system

to destroy all copies of material which may have been

derived from HTLINGUAL material.

We know, for

instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items related to

Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection

In sun, the 201 on Oswald contains all the

information we are aware of that we had prior to the

assassination.

Attachment VI

Disposition Of CIA/HSCA Sequestered Collection and

other Assassination Records.

This attachment discusses proposed agreements

National Archives and Records Administration regarding the

disposition of JFK Assassination-related records held by CIF

which are not already at the National Archives, and the

terms under which those records to be declassified will be

dealt with.

Discussion.

1. "Processing of CIA Assassination Records by September

1998". Per agreement with the Review Board, the

declassification review of all records, unless specifically

designated for post-September 1998 processing by the Review

Board, in the following categories will be completed and the

releasable version of the records ready for transfer to the

National Archives by September 30, 1998:

• Non-duplicate documents from the CIA-HSCA sequestered •

collection, the Russ Holmes files and the LA Division

working files;

• Documents designated as assassination. records as a result

of Review Board specific requests for additional

information and records (CIA 1-16, CIA-IR 1-37) ;

• All documents from Lee Harvey Oswald's "A" file and post-

1978 201 file; Oswald's 201 file and security file and

Marina Oswald's 201 (microfilm version) have already been

transferred to NARA;

post-1978 part of his 201 file.

2.

"Processing of Duplicate Documents and Commitments for

the Future Treatment of Assassination Records".

• CIA/HSCA sequestered collection duplicates to be

completed and transferred to NARA by September 1999.

• Russ Holmes Working Files to be completed and a

declassified version transferred to NARA by December

1998.

• Mexico City tapes (186) to be completed and transferred

to NARA by September 1999. [CIA-IR-15]

• Post-September 1998 Discovery of Assassination Records.

Diligent searches have been made and we are aware of no

assassination records being withheld from the Board.

However, given the Agency's decentralized records systems,

it is possible that assassination-related documents will be

discovered in the future. A guide has been prepared for

be meet to the ga Xe order Ravis nation

records that are discovered will be processed according to

JEK release standards and forwarded to NARA. A copy of the

guide is attached. (TAB 1)

• Referrals not complete by 30 September 1998. The CIA

proposes

that it complete its review and return to

originating agency by April 1999 all unreviewed third

agency referral documents which were received prior to 30

September 1998.

To date the following referral have been

identified for possible post-September 1998 review:

a. Army's Investigative Records Repository (from Review

Board) :

File on Alfredo Mirabal Diaz

-- 151

pages

b. SSCI -- Church Committee Records

-- TBD pages

(to be identified by Review Board staff)

c. JFK Presidential Library:

Records from Robert Kennedy files

snoos d0000

1484 pages

These documents have not been formally designated as

Assassination Records.

The CIA proposes that these be

handled in a manner similar to the John F. Kennedy

National Security Files on Cuba that were reviewed in

1996 by a joint CIA-State-DOD-Review Board task force.

3.

"Custody of CIA Assassination Records to be Released in

2017."

The CIA proposes

that the classified versions of Lee

Harvey Oswald's Security File and "A" File along with Marina

Oswald's original 201 be transferred to the protected

(secure) portion of the JFK Collection At NARA by 30

September 1998.

The CIA will need to retain custody of the

classified version of the original Oswald 201 and the CIA-

HSCA

sequestered collection to complete the review of

duplicate documents by September 1999.

In September 1999, the classified versions of the

Oswald 201 (original and microfilm from the sequestered

collection) will be transferred to NARA.

Due to the

sensitive nature of the information in the remaining

sequestered collection, particularly the NBR material, CIA

proposes that the Agency and National Archives work

joint custody arrangement that would allow these record to

remain in CIA physical custody until 2017.

(U).

We continue to identify other collections of documents

that properly belong within the JFK collection.

These

include:

The Oswald Security File; Agency working files

generated by JFK assassination investigations and requests;

and CIA documents found by other agencies and Presidential

Libraries and referred to CIA for review under the JFK Act.

II. The Time Frame of JEK Assassination Records.

(U)

In general, the time frame of JEK records commences

when Oswald arrived at the US air base (the U-2) at Atsugi,

Japan, in December 1957 and continues through the end of the

Garrison investigation in 1968.

Note, however, for

information which is clearly related to the story of the JFK

assassination or its investigations,

limitation.

there is no time frame

Any document or request that deals with the

assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, or the various conspiracy

theories should be referred to the HRG/JFK review project.

III. Key Topics, Etc.

(U)

Certain individuals, organizations, places,

projects, and subjects are central to the Oswald/ JFK story

and the ensuing investigations, which causes a number of

documents with no mention of Oswald or the assassination to

fall

within the purview of the JFK Act. Clearly, it is not

possible to list every category of document which may have

been reviewed and released under the JFK Assassination

Records Act.

The following categories contain examples of

information that are

considered to be within the JFK

review.

(U) A. JFK Assassination Investigations:

-- Warren Commission, 1963-64

- James Garrison, New Orleans DA, 1966-68

-- Rockefeller Commission, * 1975;

-- Church Committee (Senate), * 1975-76

-- House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) ,

1976-79

* JFK Assassination, anti-Castro plots and CIA anti-

Cuban operations only.

B. Key subjects

(S) -- Moscow Station, Mexico City Station, JMWAVE Station,

and CIA stations in those cities through which

Oswald passed on his way to and from the Soviet

as they related to Oswald's activities or to

possible conspiracies.

(AIUO) -- CIA anti-Cuban operations 1960-64 (Mongoose, etc.)

if they involve JEK figures (see comment on

Meagher's

activities in 1963 are considered relevant.

(U)

-- Cuban exile anti-Castro activities, leaders and

organizations, 1960-64, if they involve JFK figures.

-- Castro assassination activities (plans and

attempts); no limit on time frame.

-- Mafia, if related to Castro, JEK,

or New Orleans

during Oswald time frames (see attached chronology).

(AIUO) C. Key figures

(the following individuals are considered JFK

assassination-related, unless the context is clearly

unrelated or outside the appropriate time period)

-- AMMUG, Cuban defector;

-- Maurice Bishop, alleged to exist (any reference) ;

-- Silvia Duran, employee in Cuban Embassy, Mexico

-- Richard Gibson and the Free Cuba Committee;

-- Howard Hunt, CIA employee;

included in the Board statement the fact that the DCI had sent a letter endorsing my declaration. /

suggested to the GC that even with this addition, the JFK Board comment would be most unfortunate.

The whole six year effort was designed to put to rest all of the conspiracy theories and this comment

would undercut the effort. In addition, it likely would result in significant additional questions, additional

work for DIM, OCA, OGC and PAS, and put the Agency in a bad light. I suggested that I should ask the

EXDIR to sign the declaration. The GC interposed no objection. I then spoke with the EXDIR who agreed

to sign a declaration if this would satisfy the situation. I informed the GC that the EXDIR was willing to

sign and the GC asked me to inform

under penalty of perjury, that they had conducted thorough searches and identified all relevant records.

The CIA refused. The Board then, as an alternative, asked the highest officials of the Agency - - the

Executive Director and General Counsel - - to certify that CIA had met its obligations under the JFK Act

and that no records on Oswald or assassination were withheld. The CIA refused. Instead, the CIA

designated its Director of Information Management to sign CIA's Declaration of Compliance. In the

Board's view, CIA's highest officials should have been willing to certify, under oath, that the Agency has

complied with all the requirements of the JFK Act. The ClA's failure to do so raises serious concerns for

the Board that the CIA has in fact fully complied with the JFK Act."

1. In Cold Warrior, (p. 52) Mangold refers to a CI secret slush fund which was tightly

controlled by Angleton and never audited by, the usual procedures. According to

Mangold, it was this fund which allowed Anglebon to run his own operations without

supervision. Did the fund exist? Was this fund ever audited? Are there any, recörds of

C operational expenses for the period 1959-633...

2. Mangold also refers (p. 53) to an unnamed CI/B&F officer who says he worked for

Angieton from 1958-1964 and never dealt with him directly on a single matter. Is there

a list of B&F officers assigned to the CI Staff from 1959-63. Do their records still exist?

3. We have seen Directorate of Operations monthly operational reports which contain

information on the allocation/ distribution of operational funds. Are there other DO or

DA records which reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this type of

information from the early 1960's still be retrieved?

Budget and Finance

Question

1 - In Cold Warrior Mangold refers to a CIA secret

lush tune welch was tagatly controlled by Angleton and no

audited by usual procedures.

Did the fund exist

Was the fund

audited?

Are there any records of CI operational, expenses for

the period 1959-63?

According to C/Financial Service Division (FSD/OFL) who

contacted & former finance officer who was

a secretary in CI in

1957-60, to the best of their recollection CI did not have their

own finance offices. C/FSD also talked to another officer during

that era who did not recall that CI was one of the early offices

to do their own certification of expenses. It was his feeling

that there very well may

have been a CI fund that was not

handled in the usual way however it is very unlikely to

Impossible that any rund was not audited/certifled in some

fashion (i.e. reviewed and certified decentrally and only

reported on the books in some aggregate amount). He commented

that he has never in discussion with finance officers heard of an

account managed by staff officers that wasn't certified by

someone in finance.

Question 2 - Mangold also refers to unnamed CI/B&F officer

who says he worked for Angleton from 1958-64 and never dealt with

him directly on a single matter.

Is there a list of B&F

officers assigned to the CI staff from 1959-63? Do their records

still exist?

OFL - The Career Management Officer stated that we would

need the name of the B&r officer in order to identify if he/she

was assigned to the CI/Staff. CMO also stated that he does have

some old records during that time period pertaining to

assignments but the list he has is alphabetical by name.

The

current procedure is that the soft file maintained in OFL

contains

the assignment of each officer in the biographical

profile.

HRM - Has microfilm staffing complements for the 1959-63

These staffing complements were created on a

quarterly basis and are broken down by the office (location)

With the correct directorate/office name we can visually

search these microfilm records, find the correct office and

produce hardcopy reports listing the

employees on the rolls

for a

given quarter. The hardcopy report could be reviewed to break

down the office listing by occupation and create a list of names

associated with the occupation (i.e.

B&F officers assigned to CI

from 1959-63.

The employee name could then be used to located

current or archived HRM files. CAUTION: 1) If an individual came

---

## Page 105

14-00000

and left an office during the same quarter they might not appear

on the stäffing complement, 21

It

an individual was TDY to an

office they would not appear on the staffing complement of that

office. 3) If an individual

was being paid by their home office

they would not appear on

the staffing complement of the outside

office they

were supporting.

Question 3 - We bave seen DO monthly operational reports

which contain information on the allocation/distribution of

operational funds.

Are there other DO or DA records which

reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this

type of information from the early 1960s still be retrieved?

The DO operational fund records would contain expenditures

against a certain project or operation.

However, according to

C/FSD the system that preceded the General Accounting System

(GAS) waS RCA 501 (not sure what this contained) but in all

probability has been destroyed, would have this type of

information also. More information may have been recorded in 201

files similar to today's automated systems.

Question 4 - What records are kept on disbursements in the

field?

If hypothetically LH0 had received money from the Agency

What records would erist?

According to the OFL Records Cortzol Schedule station

accounting containing indigenous personnel are kept for 56 years,

station accounting not containing indigenous personnel are kept

20 years.

Personnel

Question 1 - What records are maintained on contract

personnel?

Responsibility for records maintained on independent

contract personnel was transferred to CEL ola 1 October 1996.

Staff contract personnel files continue to be maintained by HRM.

Office Contract Personnel Files contain many of the same

Items found in the staff Official Personnel File (OPF)-

application info, actions (Staff contracts only) clearance info,

secrecy agreement, etc., and also contract info (agreements,

amendments, terminations, etc.)

maintained.

A separate payroll file was also

IC's - fee for task

Staff Contracts - hired for job--not to exceed 5 years.

Contract files can be opened/maintained/retired in true

name, pseudo, alias of crypt depending upon the sensitivity of

the contract.

## Page 106

SECUITEY

Question 1 - For the period between 1955-65, what was the

universe of files that OS had on individuals or groups?

Ops located information which describes the categories 0f...

files created.during.this.time.frame.but it is. impossible t0.......

erate .i3 1s all anclusive:

General

- Usually unsclicited correspondence of crank

variety and junk.

Security Research Staff - possibly material of

counterintelligence interest.

DCS contacts - persons who travel abroad and/or have

specific information.

Contractor Employees - industrial contractors with

collateral and/or SCI accesses

Miscellaneous • Includes publications, organizations,

intelligence services, etc.

Alien - Foreign nationals who were of interest

New Building - Persons involved with construction of

original Headquarters Building

Regular - Files which included staff employees, contractors,

GSA/GSI, etc.

Question 2 - How are Office of Security records indexed?

Prior to 1964 all index records were maintained on 3x5 inch

index cards.

When the information was known, these cards

polygraph number, reference source data,

information codes,

remarks. SSN, sex, employer, and file retirement data. To locate

a file

record, the subject of interest was searched in this card

system.

During mid-1964 these index cards with the exception of

impersonal entities, were under conversion to a keypunch system.

The impersonals (companies, publications, intelligence services.

possibly mid-1970s. Aside form the subject name indices, the

Office of Security also indexed information of interest within a

companies, publications, other government agency reports

'information, etc.

TODAY'S INDEXING PARAMETERS ARE VERY LIMITED.

---

## Page 107

Question 3 - What was the function of the office of

Security/Security Research Staff

(OS/ SRS)? Why were defector

records kept in this component?

..The SecurityResearch Staff.(SPS).was.the.component...

responsible.for.collecting...developing.and evaluat.ing

information of a

counterintelligence nature to detect and/or

prevent penetration of the Agency's organization, employees, and

accivicles by torelan or domestic

organizations or individuals.

SPS conducted research in connection with employee loyalty cases

and maintained records identifying personalities, environments,

and personal traits of individuals who had been of

counterintelligence interest over the years.

SPS maintained

wich various government agencies in connection with

counterintelligence activities and coordinated the counter

intelligence effort throughout OS. SRS reported directly to the

Director of Security.

Question 1 - In the OS/SRS memo of Oct 31, 1960 written by

Marguerite D. Stevens, the file numbers of several defectors are

listed.

What do the MS and EE file prefixed designate? How are

these designations assigned.

As noted in question 1, records were categorized according

to the type and the older file numbers reflected

category.

"M" designated a miscellaneous record; "S" designated

a Security Research Staff record.

Therefore "MS" most likely

referred to a miscellaneous record of interest to the Security

Research Staff.

"E" or "EE" designations covered subjects of

interest to the Domestic Contacts Division for

information/intelligence purposes. •It appears that

at least some

of these alpha designations were converted to numerical values

cirCa 1964.

Question 5 - Does OS process security clearances for non-

employees (e.g. sources) to receive access to classified

information?

What kind of files are created by this process?

How long are these files maintained.

Security clearances per se are not processed for non-

employees

(sources/contacts).

The Office of Security conducts

appropriate national agency checks to try to determine the

reliability of those individuals who are of interest for contact

purposes because of their foreign travels, specific scientific

information, etc.

In a few instances an ad hoc

clearance/validation may be requested in the event some

classified information would be revealed in the course of

acquiring intelligence

from these sources.

The validation period

is normally five years.

files created are maintained in

the individual's name for a period of ten years after the

validation period has expired

The DO would

most likely have

further information on a particular source.

...°

## Page 108

Question 6 - Where are records that would describe liaison

(etc) cooperation or operationg between OS and CI located? How

are these recoids organized?

..1. the short

turnaround time imposed on responding in this

request no information couis be

readily located to provzde an

answes to this question.

It is believed that it information

....

this nature does exist,

it may be located in archived policy or "

administrative files of the defice of security andior Security

Research Staff.

Retrieval and reriew of this information would

require an extensive research effort. Officers who may possess

knowledge of this type of record were queried and it was

suggested that info responsive to this question may possibly be

located in DO records.

Question 7 - Where are records regarding operations that OS

participated in or ran located?

FoI example, where are the os

records on the Castro assassination attempts?

Records on operations and/or projects in which the Office of

Security was involved in the past have most likely been

destroyed, unless they are maintained because of congressional

directives or the records control schedules.

The Office of

Personnel Security has the capability of retrieving a listing of

any current records with the prefix or "project" or "operation".

If the title does not include these words, retrieveal would be

dafficult unless an exact name or acronym is known for a

Question 8 - How many files did Os have on Oswald? Which as

components maintained files on Oswald? Why did OS have any files

on Oswald?

OPS answered in CIA-16. Copy attached.

Toni

Thant you for agreeing to participate in briefing the JFK

assassinaison Records Review BOGId (ARRE) to be held on Monday,

17 March, at 2:00 p.m., in 2C06 IP Bldg.

I regret the short

notice.

AS we discussed, the APPe has

asked for information

relating to the creation,

transmission, and dissemination of

cables and your name instantly came to mind.. Their specific

1- Can you describe the cable process in place in the Agency

during the

1960-1964 time period?

Prior to 1962 messages were delivered to the DPD

(Development Products Division)

at 1717 H Street or to the

Communications Center at "I" Street. In addition there

also was a l building that received special traffic.

After 1962 messages came into the CIA Headquarters and

were processed in different areas depending on the

types of traffic.

Imagery traffic would be sent to to a specific floor

for the imagery personnel. Intercept and Special Programs

would either be passed to a Special Sections Area of the

Communications Center or to the Cable Secretariat.

2- How did cables come in?

Messages came in from the field via

§- How were they decrypted?

Messages were deciphered using a OTT (One Time Tape)

or a OTP (One Time Pad) process.

---

## Page 110

4- What nappened from the time a carie was

sent from a field

site until it arrived

on a dest. ât Headguarters?

Messages

sent from a field site would be passed to a

........

communicator; encrypted and transmitted via

High Frequency Radio. The message received from

and relayed to headquarters and then it was decrypted.

The analyst of the Cable Secretariat would then read the

message and match what they read against customer

requirements. They then would have a typist type the

dissemination on the message. The message then would be

picked up from the message center by the various staffs

and or divisions.

5- How were cables disseminated?

See item four.

Please let me or Becky Rant, DA/IRO, know if you have any

other questions or concerns prior to the briefing.

Bonnie:

This is with respect to your 26 February 1998 note wherein you asked that we check HRM for personnel files on Ron Cross, Bart

Henry and William Morris Kent. In an effort to bring the status of this particular tasking (CLA-IR-12) up-to-date, I provide the fallowing:

My records show that on 18 July 1997 Barry requested that we conduct file searches on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross, Bart Henry and

Doug Gupton. We were advised by Barry, and as outined in a 22 May 1996 letter from ARRB to John Pereira, that Cross, Henry and

Gupton are pseudonyms used by CIA personnel who testified to the HSCA.

Notwithstanding, we tasked OPS and HRM to canduct searches on these individuals in an effort to locate files. On 22 December 1996,

I advised Barry that HRM had located files on Ted Shackley and would provide them to Barry via this office once they arrived from AC. I1

is my understanding that Becky gave you the OPF yesterday. HAM advsied further that they had attempted to locate files on Cross.

Henry and Gupton but failed to locate any files on these individuals in light of the fact that only the pseudos had been provided. We

further advised that it in the future you have access to the true names, we will glady search again.

On 23 December 1997, I advised Barry that OPS had located files on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross and Doug Gupton and that the files were

in OPS for review. They were unable to locate a record on Bart Henry, It is my understanding that you have not reviewed these files to

date but are in the process of making arrangements to do so

conducted the search back in July and I am certain that -

she will be glad to you in this matter (40000).

And lastly, I have no record of ever having received a request to search on William Morris Kent. Accordingly, I will request OPS and

HRM to do so.

Please let me know if I have misinterpreted the status of this request. Thank you. Frieda

and the Office of Security also had

a subject file on Lee

Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in

the automated security database

known as the Management Data

Program/Personnel Security (MOP/PS). These files were

originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the

above numbers circa 1954.

A hand search was also conducted

of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated

system.

This hand search produced the same resulis as the

automated search of MDP/PS.

(U)

In your request specific mention is made of an

ATLINGUAL file. MDP/PS Ieflects

Os maintained four official

files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),

#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of

the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along

with numerous soft files.

Since this

_material has been

destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files

contained any informasion on lee Harvey Oswald. A search of

Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any of

these files.

(U) Attached is all of the available information

regarding the destruction of the aTLINGUAl files. This

information was retrieved from

of the

Information Management Branch/Records Control Section and

from a review of general office administrative files.

Question ai (U) Other than for the 201-289248 file

on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was

opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and

the documents thai were in the file at the time of the

assassination.

(U)

As noted above, all ETLINGUAL files have

been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in

chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in

close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAI was

undertaken.

This seaich revealed the approximate opening

dates

for the four official HtLInGUAL files as:

Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during

which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in

contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the

Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.

Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the

Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution

of these reports.

In the beginning this material was

probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of

documents on this person increased, a separate file was

created to be the repository of information on the alleged

(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of

Response to CIA-IF-11

Barry & Gary:

I have reviewed the draft response to CIA-IR-11 dated 13 August 1998 and following are my

comments and requested changes:

Paragraphs 1 and 2 - OK

_ Para 2a: EPSTEIN, Edward J. --The DO found no files identifiable with subject; a file was found

on an individual with the same name but; with research, it was determined that the individual was not the

Edward J. Epstein who is the subject of this request. DA searches found a Center for CIA Security,

formerly the Office of Personnel Security, file and a Publications Review Board file on subject, as well as

three "hits" to records destroyed pursuant to normal records destruction schedules. The destroyed

records involved three Freedom of Information requests that mention Epstein's name in the subject line.

None of the requests were for information on Epstein.

Para 2b: LANE, Mark

4th line - Please change Public Affairs to Privacy Act request

Para 2c: MEAGHER, Sylvia - A reference to the fact subject made a Privacy Act request was

found. In addition, the Center for CIA Security found that it had, at one time, a folder on subject and a

1968 Ramparts Magazine article. Both subject's Privacy Act request file and the impersonal folder have

been destroyed pursuant to normal record control schedules.

Para 2d: defer to DO

Para 2e: WEISBERG, Harold

11th line - Please change Office of Security to Center for CIA Security.

In so far as DA equities are concerned, I concur with draft letter once the above changes have

been incorporated.

Priority Requests from JFK Board

Request dated 17 December 1996

1. (C)

In response to referenced request for "additional

files"

searches on Spas I. Raikin and Marilyn Dorothy Murret, the

Office of Personnel Security conducted appropriate searches of

the Management Data Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). MDP/PS

is the automated database oi security records used by the Office

of Personnel Security.

The searches undertaken were reasonaoly

calculated to uncover ali responsive records.

The Oifice cê Personnel Security has a file on Spas

I. Raikin (#0134669).

This file rechecus that in August 1957

Foreign Documents Divisior/00 requested a ciearance on Spas I.

Raikin for unclassified contract

employment with Project u.s.

Joint Publications

Research Service in New York City on an

unwitting basis.

The Cifice of Security responded there was no

information which would preclude use of Me. Raikin. On 31

January 1967 the Office of Security again granted approval for

Mr. Raikin to be used as an unwitting independent contractor with

the U.S. Joint Publications Research Service.

3.

(C)

The Office of Personnel Security does not maintain

a security ille on Marilyn Doroiny Murret, but there 1s an index

record to an media articie dated 1971 from Computers and

Automation. This article contains the statement that Marylyn

MurIelt i5 Lee Harvey Oswald's cousin and thai evidence indicates

Frieda,

I have completed searches for Andrew Anderson, as Anderson for maximum hits, on Howard

Guebler under Guebler, on Gordon Novel under Novel and Edward Butler ünder Butler, all last names for

maximum possible hits. My searchs on these four individuals produced no hits, no records, and no

indexed data on one and all.

I note the presumption "Evidently, he (Anderson) was a former employee" because he had a AIN

number of 0 800211. An AIN number is an Agency Identification Number, not necessarily suggesting an

"employee" relationship. An "EIN" is an Employee Identification Number, but what categories of

employment fall under it, I'm not prepared to say.

ATTACHMENT IO 1l MARCH 1228 MEMCRINDUM RE: CIA-IR-3€

1.

Per the review board stalf's request the following.

is a brief explanation

of how the Directorate of Operations

records on the subjec.,

0 ..

provided is based solely on the memory of DO officers

familiar with procedures in place at the time.

2. Each area division in the DO maintained and staffed

its own registry.

Although each registry was configured to

meet each division's unique requirements, there were common

functions performed by all the registries to include:

collecting, sorting, and celivering of incoming cables:

maintenance of incoming and outgoing cable "chronos":

collecting and delivering of incoming and outgoing pouch

material; and the issuance and maintenance of "pseudo and

alias" card files.

3. To the specific question regarding processing of

cables, on a daily basis, usually six day per week, each

recistry collected its incoming cape traiiic from a central

processing point, then called the Cable Secretariate, within

яри су

the disicadi Communications.

The incoming cables were ther

sorted by registry personnel

according to pre-defined

: Duel guidelines.

rhese guidelines were unique to each civiszon

and were Irequently altered to meer changing operational

requirements.

Sorted cables were inen delivered to speciiic

operational/area desks.

. A "chrono" copy of each was

maintained, on

a temporary basis, usually for 90 days and

then destroyed.

4.

Outgoing cables were created and coordinated by

appropriate operational/area desks and usually released by

the chief of the division or a designated releasing officer.

"Released" cables were then hand delivered or sent by

pneumatic tube system ( a system long ago dismantled from

the original Headquarters building) to Cablé Secretariate

for processing into the Agency's communication network.

"Chrono" copies of outgoing cables were forwarded to the

registry for

a 90 day hold and then destroyed.

5.

It is important to note that the cable scenario

outlined heze is general in nature and that throughout their

existence registries and their procecures were frequently

altered until the registry system as described above was

eliminated in the

mid-1980's.

JEK Declaration of FREDRICK C. WICKHAM, JR.

I, Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. declare and say as follows:

1.

(U)

• I am the JEK Focal point Officer ("EPO") for

the Directorate of Operations ("DO") of the United States

Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA"). I have held technical

positions associated with the design and implementation of

computer systems, information management positions including

the DO IMO, and currently manage the DO information review

and release programs.

I have been with the CIA since 1967

and have been associated with the JEK records review

activity since 1992 and the JEK EPO since 1995.

2.

(U) I have obtained the information contained in

this declaration based upon my personal knowledge and

experience,

as well

as conversations with the Do Information

Review Officer, the DO Information Management Officer and

individuals taking action on the specific requests.

3.

(U) DO records were predominately paper with a

hard copy card index in the 1960's and an electronic index

in the 1970's.

The indices were based upon names that meet

specific collection requirements or projects that were

undertaken in the performance of our mission.

Searches that

exceeded the capability of the indices required manual paper

file searches.

I am aware that the DO searched the central

record system, which includes retired records, and hand

searched the convenience files and specialized files located

within various offices.

Specialized collections are often

extremely sensitive and therefore only reside within the

components.

During our newer searches we have not found any

significant documents in the DO files dated 1978 or prior

that appear to have been missed by the searches through

1978. We did locate one set of

tapes which we know was made

•available to the Warren Commission but was not included in

the HSCA sequestered collection.. We also found one file

that was only partially included in the HSCA sequestered

collection.

4.

(S) Many of the searches performed today are not

significantly different than the ones done during the period

of the various commissions and committees.

The searches

performed since 1995 still use the index to the central

record system the same as in 1978 but we have a couple of

new databases that were not available in 1978.

We now

capture all cable traffic electronically and are able to

perform text searches of that repository. That repository

post-dates the HSCA so it is not useful in locating older

Additionally, we have converted a small amount of

very sensitive paper files into computer searchable form.

While these specific collections are part of the DO's record

not electronically searchable nor were

they included within the indices to the DO's central records

We have searched all of these records systems for

information responsive to requests the DO has received.'

Some of the specific requests could not be satisfied by the

electronic searches and we resorted to manual paper searches

in an effort to locate the information.

5.

(U) The DO provided several briefings to the

Assassination Records Review Board and their staff, starting

in 1995, to describe the records created by the DO and the

record system that manages that

information.

We also

described what is meant by the need to continue protection

of sources and methods, and the impacts the revelation of

information would have

on the lives of individuals and

current operations.

The presenters included the Agency's

General Counsel, Deputy Director for Operations, Chief of

the Information Management Staff, and several other DO

managers associated with the conduct of operations

protection of sources and methods. We also provided

detailed descriptions of current operations.

We provided

information about specific individuals whose lives or

livelihood would be threatened as examples of harm that

would occur if certain information was released.

Additionally, we presented a description of the operational

environment

that existed and the intensity under which

searches were performed in the wake of the assassination.

6.

(U) The CIA issued an Agency-wide employee

bulletin for a

new search for JEK Assassination records (OIM

98-0081, dated 30 July 1998). As requested by the ARRB, the

DO distributed the employee bulletin via Lotus Notes on

August and placed it on the morning message that people

receive when they first log onto the system.

7. (U)

We have received numerous specific requests for

additional information.

Based on personal knowledge and on

information reflected in our records, I am aware of the

following efforts that were conducted in responding to

specific ARRB requests for DO records. I have abbreviated

the questions to sáve space:

CIA-1 - Information on the organization of CIA

(U) The March 1995 ARRB request called for the

availability of "comprehensive organizational charts

(or the best available substitutes)." The request

contained about three pages of various requirements,

including:

A. organizational charts of the Directorate of Plans

(DDP); "CIA Stations

• . . in Mexico City (1960-68

only), Miami, other stations that we will discuss

orally;" any other offices

.. • any pro Castro groups,

• or anti-Castro groups;

B. names and affiliations of all CIA personnel

responsible for liaison with the Warren Commission, the

House Select Committee on Assassinations, . . .;

C. all manuals, handbooks,.. • guides explaining: •

• organizational structure, . . . filing systems, . .

• for drafting memoranda;

D. copies of the instructions, guidelines, and other

materials used by your reviewers;

(U)

Over a thousand pages of material were

provided in responding to this request.

(U) In May 1997 the ARRB further requested that 35

pages from CSN 5-50, 2 pages of the JMWAVE chart, and

3

13 pages

from Regulation No. 1-130 and HR #1 be

reviewed

for release.

(U) Although the AARB staff had access to all of

the requested material, in January 1998 the Agency

answered that the various CSN 5-50 pages contained

basic information regarding the mission and functions

of the Office of Operations (now the Directorate of

Operations (DO)) and could not be released. However, in

April 1998, we agreed to provide structure charts for

the DDP in 1961 and 1963, with Division and Staff

titles and a JMWAVE Chart.

CIA-2 - Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U) The ARRB request was dated May 1995 and was

six pages of file code numbers, crypts, names, dispatch

designators, and cable location designators and

requested identification thereof. A variety of methods

of responses was utilized, (some dated June and July

1995 and some undated) to answer, including a paired

listing (returned to CIA) microfilm file summary

sheets, and descriptive sheets.

CIA-3 - Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U) This ARRB request was dated June 1995 and was

three more pages of queries similar to CIA-2. A

variety of methods of responses was utilized, (some

dated June 1995 and some undated) to answer,

including

a paired listing marked (returned to CIA), microfilm

file summary sheets, and handwritten notes.

CIA-4 - Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U)

This

four-page ARRB request dated June 1995

was

for "descriptions of each crypt, a brief

identification of each individual . . . , and

indications of whether these crypts, operations, and

individuals are presently active or inactive." This

request

was answered orally and by informal notes.

CIA-5 - Queries About Some Information

(U) This ARRB request was dated July 1995 and was

Ior identification of some twelve crypts, names, file

codes, or acronyms. This was answered by a paired

listing dated July 1995 (Returned to CIA) .

CIA-6 -- Request for Systematic Review of Traffic

(U) This request was dated September 1995 and was

for "the CIA to assemble all of the cable traffic and

dispatches for . .

• September 26, 1963 through October

20, 1963 and November 22, 1963 through December 30,

1963 between" . . . Mexico City and Headquarters and

Mexico City and JMWAVE.

The DO provided a classified response in

January 1998. All cable traffic and dispatches for the

period September 26, 1963 through October 20, 1963 and

November 22, 1963 through December 30, 1963 between:

,' (a) the Mexico city Station and Headquarters, and (B)

the Mexico City Station and JMWAVE are not available as

a chronological collection.

The Office of

Communications (OC) only held cables long enough to

ensure that they were successfully transmitted to the

recipient. Because processes and resources to perform

cleanup activity varies, cables were sometimes held for

longer periods but not with the intention of becoming a

long-term reference collection. The offices of record

retained for more than 90 days. There is no electronic

repository for cables and dispatches from the stations.

Cables were printed out and went into specific files

dealing with subjects or operations.

Accordingly, it

is not possible to recreate as a collection all of the

requested cables and dispatches.

CIA - 7 - Review of CIA Histories

(S) ARRB staffers Jeremy Gunn and Michelle Combs

have reviewed all of the requested histories except one

still under pre-review by the component because of

sensitive information - we expect this to be resolved

in the near future. They were granted access to

identify any relevance to the assassination of

President Kennedy. They selected a number of pages to

be included within the materials to be declassified

and

released to the National Archives.

The histories

reviewed

provided a classified response to the ARRB together

with a copy of DOI 50-46,

and advised that an unclassified response

was

not possible.

CIA-11 - Sylvia Duran Materials

(U) This request was dated May 1996 and was "in

particular

nave given to the Mexican pone stars saxo may

its main index system, its 'names' data base, and hard

copy files." The Agency response, dated October 1997,

indicated to the ARRB that "no such 'statement' has

ever been

found and we cannot confirm that it ever

existed."

CIA-12 - Files on five persons allegedly connected

with JMWAVE

(U) This ARRB request was dated May 1996 for "all

201 files, personnel files, Office of Security files,

P-files, or any other files related to ... David Sanchez

Morales ... Ted Shackley .. Ron Cross .. Bart Henry and

Doug Gupton.

(U) The DO maintains no files on former employees,

such as Morales, Shackley, or Gupton (P) .

(U) In a response dated August 1998, the DO

responded to DA/OIM/HRP/JEK that we were unable to

identify Ron Cross and Bart Henry as true names,

registered aliases, or pseudonyms and, therefore, could

not provide any files.

CIA - 13 - Mexico City Back-channel Communications

(U) The DO provided a classified response

explaining that these types of communications are

usually administrative matters, e.g, they contain

sensitive personnel information and they are not placed

in operational files or saved, collectively, in other

databases. Unfortunately, there is no way of

retrieving these cables through a

reasonable search

using any generic or specific term, since cables were

not captured by any organized filing process.

CIA - 14 - Mexico City Station Annual Reports

(U)

The DO was

asked for specific annual reports from

Mexico City.

(S) We informed the ARRB that we were successful in

locating an official DO file which contained station

"annual reports" for the years 1957 through_.

The

file included two dispatches which forwarded the RMDs

from Mexico Station for the years 1960 and 1961.

However, the RMDs, which were sent as separate

attachments (sent in a different pouch from the

covering dispatch memorandum) were not present in the

file.

(NOTE:

Attachments which contained true names

of CIA officers or assets or information that would

identify operational sources with CIA were customarily

sent in separate transmissions as a security measure if

a pouch (es) were compromised).

We also note that in

a speed letter, dated 1978, written by DDO/LA/STB to

OLC, that the RMDs for Mexico City Station, for the

years, 1962, 1963, or 1964 could not be located.

(S) Based upon further review, we are providing an

updated response to the ARRB as follow: The only

report that was annually required of a station was that

relating to its ability to meet its mission directives,

now called "operational directives".

These annual

reports called the Station's "Relative Mission

Directives" (RMD)

were used to compose an overall

annual division or staff submission to the Deputy

Director for Operations, as an evaluative tool.

The

RMDs, themselves are a

summary of station activities

reported to Headquarters in other correspondence during

the course of the

year, were used to compile a division

level evaluation--in a sense, an annual report card-on

how

it was doing against operational requirements.

The

station reporting was extracted into the larger

13

## Page 202

SECRET

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

division summary, much as it

is today. The RMDs from

year-to-year could and often did change with the

operational requirements the Agency was expected to

fulfill.

As such, the RMDs for each station had value

only as data to the larger examination of how the

Agency performed its intelligence mission in a given

year and what trends or changes this review would

suggest for the ensuing year.

(U)

Station reporting of the type described above

would be treated as transitory information and as such

meet the definition of a temporary record. It is

entirely possible and quite probable that these

facilitative reports were systematically destroyed.

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)

authorized the Agency to destroy facilitative reports

in 1954 (NARA Reference: II-NNA-1057); the destruction

of intelligence. collection requirement files in 1962

(NARA Reference:

NN-163-1), and operational management

objective files

at the subcomponent level (which would

include reports from. Stations and base) in 1977 (NARA

Reference:

NC1-263-77-10).

The 1977 authorization

remains in force today.

CIA - 15 - Win Scott files from Russ Holmes files

Mr. Scott's Mexico City files were retired as Job 78-

00594R on 11 August 1972. These records were retired

to the Agency's Archives and Records Center under Item

Number 40-76 in the Records Control Schedule in effect

at the time.

Files under Item Number 40-76 were

described as:

"Temporary. Destroy on completion of specific job

or as they serve their purpose.

CIA - 16 - Oswald Pre-Assassination Files

(S)

The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO

records to determine if there were any additional files

containing pre-assassination records relating to

Research identified a document in the Oswald

201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The

document identified CI Staff as the file custodian.

CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were

incorporated into the 201.

(S) Prior to establishing a 201, any documents

received would have been placed in an operational

interest file.

We found no reference to the existence

of an operational interest file. If such a file had

existed, however, it might not have been registered in

the central index.

It was standard procedure that

upon opening a 201, the documents from an operational

interest file would be transferred to the 201.

(S) Given that Oswald was a subject of the

HTLINGUAL operation, it is reasonable to believe that

there was a file on him.

We destroyed all of the

HTLINGUAL files under court order, and no record was

made of what files existed.

We did not review all of

the DO record system to destroy all copies of material

which may have been derived from HTLINGUAL material.

We know,

for instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items

related

to Oswald in

the HSCA sequestered collection.

(S) In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the

information we

are aware of that we had prior to the

assassination.

CIA-IR-01 - Personnel Assigned to Post from 1959-1964

(S) The request for

listing of personnel

assigned to Moscow 1959-1964 was discussed with Board

Staff.

Instead of a listing, the files on individuals

who were

]were made available.

In addition, the staff

interviewed a former COS Moscow.

The Board staff is

satisfied with the response and will prepare its own

documentation.

CIA-IR-03 - Full Computer Search for List of HTLINGUAL

Files

(C) First, as an outcome of the Pike and Church

Committees investigations, all HTLINGUAL files which

were identifiable, as such, were destroyed under court

order.

Copies of

materials from these files that may

have been made prior to the destruction order and put

into other files have, however, surfaced as files are

reviewed. This includes material in the HSCA

sequestered collection.

Some records were identified as destroyed. Some were

not so marked but are not locatable under the job

number identified; however, given that there is no

requirement to record destroyed records under the

Federal statutes for disposition programs and given

limited resources for noting files destroyed, this is

not uncommon. The HTLINGUAL search further identified

files because they had been the subject of Freedom of

Information Act queries; however, these were not

HTLINGUAL files per se, but files which contained the

FOIA requester queries for HTLINGUAL information.

(U) ARRB staff member Michelle Combs has reviewed

the HTLINGUAL file run and has selected some folders

for review.

OIM has identified that they have only

redacted records for the large FOIA case that is

listed.

IMS/ESG/HCS is retrieving its records for

unredacted copies of the records and will make them

available.

SUBJECT: JEK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(U) The DO provided the following unclassified

response about the Angleton Files: The files that

Kalaris mentioned in Mangold's book were incorporated

with the files of the CI staff.

Per memorandum dated

1976-1979, the CI files were reviewed and incorporated

into the DO record system.

Items that were duplicates

or not worthy of retention were destroyed. The memos

describe the file collection and the process that was

tollowed.

Because the files that were once known as

Angleton's have been dispersed within the Do records,

they are

no longer identifiable as a collection.

CIA-IR-06 -- @KENCHANT

(U) IMS/ESG/HCS initially provided

a classified

response to DA/OIM/JFK for this request in February

1998.

In a follow-up response for declassification of

the response, IMS/ESG/HCS worked with the providing

office and then approved DA/OIM/JEK's unclassified

response.

CIA-IR-07 - Claude Barnes Capehart

(U) The Do provided a classified response, which

stated that we found no record when conducting a name

trace for records on Capehart.

Subsequently, we were

advised by the CIA's Project Manager, Mr. J. Barry

that this request was primarily being

researched by the Directorate for Science & Technology.

CIA-IR-09 -- George Bush

(S) The ARRB requested information about George

Bush because of a

reference to "George Bush of the

Central Intelligence Agency" in a certain FBI document

dated November 1963.

1998 that the "search determined the Agency has no

record of any association with George Herbert Walker

Bush during the 1963 time period."

CIA-IR-11 - Warren Commission critics (Does CIA

maintain files or records on specified critics - other

than press clippings?)

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response for

"any files or records on Warren Commission critics

Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Harold

Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher below.

In addition to

these records, our research did surface a reference to

a file titled

"Garrison Investigation of Kennedy

Assassination" which was opened in 1969 and closed in

1996. At the direction of the ARRB staff, no material

in response to FOIA requests or news clippings in

Public Affairs was included.

A. Edward J. EPSTEIN - The DO has no identifiable

information on subject. Our search did surface the

name Edward Epstein; however, by using additional

biographic data known about subject, we were able to

dismiss this name as a false "hit."

B. Josiah THOMPSON - Subject was of operational

interest to the DO circa 1962; therefore, a 201 file

does exist on this individual. ARRB staff member Combs

reviewed this file in August 1998.

C. Mark LANE - Our search produced references to two

documents: (1) An Agency dispatch from Germany dated

23 January 1970, and (2) An OGC letter dated 29 March

1977.

Both of these documents are available for

review. The OGC letter concerns a 1976 FOIA request --

Mark Lane was one of the individuals requesting the

FOIA action - which involves two dispatches dated 1967

response.

D.

Harold Weisberg - There is a 201 file on subject

which contains very limited information.

This file can

be made available for review by an ARRB

staff member.

The DO retired records system, CARD, has a reference to

an Agency dispatch (EGBA-87605, 1969) which indicates

subject was in correspondence with Julius Mader.

This

document was in the files when it was reviewed by staff

member Combs in August 1998.

E. Sylvia Meagher - We found no DO information.

CIA - IR-12 - Contacts with journalists or publishing

houses

(U) The DO provided both an unclassified and

classified response about contacts with journalists or

publishing houses, regarding whether CIA might have

attempted to influence any journalists or publishers

regarding public discussion of the assassination.

Searches with generic terms such as "journalists,"

"publishers," "publishing houses," and "media" would

not produce meaningful responses. This question

required the research of crypts mentioned in various

documents in the JEK "assassination records."

These

crypts referred to projects managed under the overall

guidance of a staff in the Do and in all instances were

projects

concerning press and propaganda programs

designed to promote anti-communism and to counter

Soviet press and propaganda initiatives worldwide.

Specifically, the

the following reasons (Corresponding cryptonyms to

these projects were provided in a classified document,

and are not included below):

A.

to counter Soviet activities in international

intellectual organizations, in order to unite and

promote anti-Communist intellectuals.

CIA-IR-13 -- Organized Crime

(S) As part of DA/OIM/JFK's research, IMS/ESG/HCS

was requested to do a trace on "Charles Ford." The

trace resulted in no hits.

(S) Later, to answer CIA-IR-03 on HTLINGUAL

material, a computer run was made.

The list contained

a citation to testimony to Congress by Charles Ford in

September of 1975.

A copy of Ford's testimony to a

Senate Committee regarding a Mafia connection to

assassination plots against Castro was provided to

DA/OIM/JEK in February 1998.

crypts in HMMW 12454 have been researched. The dispatch

was apparently written in haste and in truncated

language without correct knowledge of the operational

for the specific operations in Mexico City. The

in the dispatch are the more generic crypts for

teltap operations, not for the then-current operations

in Mexico City, which are in question.

(U)

There has been considerable interest over the

years in locating any electronic surveillance tapes

that would have been made during the period that Oswald

visited Mexico (26 September - 2 October 1963). A

thorough search has been conducted of the DO's record

system as well as the index to retired records in an

attempt to locate any tapes and/or find documentation

to resolve their disposition. We have discussed this

issue with operational experts and their professional

opinion is that most likely tapes such as these were

never returned to Headquarters for retention.

It was

normal practice to recycle audio tapes after

they had

been listened to by transcribers and their transcripts

made.

(U) Messages between field stations and

headquarters used operational jargon and shortened

sentence structures that can sometimes allow for

misinterpretations. Thus, possible confusion was

created when references to what was being sent to

headquarters referred to "tapes" but really intend

"information" from tapes.

(U)

In our search efforts we did locate

approximately 185 audio surveillance tapes of the Cuban

and Soviet embassies in Mexico City that were recorded

during the immediate

time following the assassination

(22 November 1963 to January 1964). The fact that

these tapes were retained

and returned to Headquarters

could account for the fact that some people recall that

some tapes existed which were sent to Headquarters.

(U)

Based upon the search efforts that were

undertaken and the opinions of operational experts

consulted, CIA has concluded that the tapes in question

do not exist and were almost certainly recycled in the

normal

course of

business before their potential value

was identified.

CIA-IR-18 - Information on one DO Office

(S) The DO provided an unclassified response on

the "Defector Staff" listed in CSN 5-50 revised in

October 1959 and the "CIA Defector Coordinator,

(U) This request involved "Howard" and some

extensive research for the name as a true name, pseudo,

or alias for anyone out of

JMWAVE and/or connected to

the DRE operation.

(U) We also did extensive research for DRE monthly

reports. In the Jik collection, there was a gap in the

reporting between December 1962 and April 1964.

(U) This also covered the question of George

Joannides' Performance Appraisal Reports and their

inclusion in the collection with some redactions.

(S) A name trace was run. The resultant

information was included in an IMS/ESG/HCS

"clarification memo" for the ARRB. The text, which was

classified "Secret," reads as follows:

"Oswald LeWinter is a naturalized US citizen and

a man of at least

four other names - George

Mearah, Oscar LeWinter, Razin LeWinter, and

Ibrahimin Razin. Although he appeared in the

East German Who's Who in CIA, the CIA has never

had any official affiliation

with LeWinter.

LeWinter was the subject of an Agency "burn

notice" in 1990; a burn notice alerts the

IMS/ESG/HCS located a workbook copy in English and

provided access to ARRB staffer Michelle Combs.

She

was further offered access to the original Russian

copies. Combs then wrote a

memorandum dated April 1997

that identified the collection as papers that

"primarily examine the habits, potential vulnerabil-

ities, and KGB approaches made to various members of

the American Embassy staff." Combs went on to say that

"no information of believed relevance to the assassin-

ation of President John F. Kennedy was found in these

papers. No pages were designated as assassination

records."

CIA-IR-32 -- AMWORLD

(C) The confidential draft of the IMS/ESG/HCS

response was shown to ARRB staffer Combs in February

1998. That text follows:

" (C) **CIA-IR-32 AMWORLD. The Review Board

seeks information regarding the purpose of

AMWORLD and its connection with the Cuban exile

groups. After a thorough search of the Do

records system, to include telephonic

communications with various DO Latin American

Division officers, we formulated the following

as a definition of the purpose of the AMWORLD

operation. The AMWORLD operation was a covert

Agency effort to provide support to several

Cuban exile groups.

operation designed to bring the exile groups

under

the direct control of Manuel Artime

Buesa. AMWORLD's mission was to cause a popular

uprising in Cuba through the use of propaganda

and paramilitary forces to ultimately overthrow

Fidel Castro.

(C) The Agency provided direct and indirect

financial aid and technical advisory support to

these groups but did not participate directly

in the day-to-day operations.

ARTIME was

responsible for recruitment of AMWORLD

personnel; he obtained sites for training and

deployment, and he had primary responsible for

day-to-day operations.

AMWORLD was based in

three locations. The AMWORLD propaganda

efforts were based in Costa Rico.

The

paramilitary efforts were run out of the

Nicaragua base.

The third base was located in

Miami to service AMWORLD requirements including

the collection of operational leads, servicing

of dead drops and assisting in the vetting of

AMWORLD personnel."

(C) Combs asked two follow up questions: Was part

of the program to put in place a government in exile?

Was there ever a government in exile?

IMS/ESG/HCS put

these questions to LA and DO/IRO. The DO/IRO has

provided the following additional write up, classified

confidential:

"(C) Based on file reviews and recollections

from officers involved in the Cuban program,

•there was never a Cuban Government in Exile:

During the planning for the Bay of Pigs

operation it was envisioned that after the

invasion site had been secured, Miro Cardona and

the Cuban Revolutionary Council would be flown

to the area to establish a new Cuban Government.

The invasion site was never secured.

(C) The AMWORLD Project, begun well after the

failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion and after

the release of Manuel Artime Buesa and other Bay

of Pigs veterans from Cuban prisons, was

designed to support and unite several Cuban

exile groups under the control of Artime in an

effort to enhance the cohesion of the exiles and

augment Artime's capability to launch propaganda

and paramilitary attacks against the Cuban

mainland.

The overall mission of AMWORLD was to

foment a popular uprising in Cuba which could

lead to the ultimate overthrow of Fidel Castro.

There is no evidence that AMWORLD's mission even

remotely came close to fruition and no evidence

that a projected government in exile was ever

considered as a viable option."'

CIA-IR-34 -- Files of CIA officials/offices

(U) IMS/ESG/HCS ran a computer search for 'OPI 40"

files. This computer run

was then made available to

ARRB staff member Michelle Combs

for review.

Her

review encompasses some 42 boxes

• from a variety of

retired DDP files. The identified folders were gathered

in an aggregate of seven boxes (including one that

exclusively microfilm and microfiche of so-called

Registry logs) .

(U) The ARRB staff member's review is about half

completed.

She has so far selected some 44 records

totaling 123 pages to be included in the JFK

collection. When the ARRB staff member's review is

completed,

the selected records will be copied and

subjected first to a duplicate check by DA/OIM/JEK

reviewers, then reviewed by those reviewers, then

reviewed by HCS reviewers.

(U) We have been unable to locate any "operational

diaries" by William Harvey.

CIA-IR-35 - Oswald related Information

(S) The surfacing of a report in the continuing

Oswald 201 file attributed to IJDECANTER prompted the

ARRB to request a review of that defector's 201 file.

Certain

such reporting records will be included in the

JEK collection as records in Oswald's 201. A Board

request for an updated search of records for Oswald

related

material generated some 128 hits, which were

reviewed by Ms: Michelle Combs of the ARRB staff.

Three records, selected by Ms. Combs and sanitized with

her concurrence, were selected for inclusion in the JFK

assassination records collection.

## Page 217

SECRET

SUBJECT: JEK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response to

the ARRB staff's request for a brief explanation of how

the Directorate of Operations processed cables in the

1963/1964 timeframe.

We are unable to locate any

Agency-wide definitive records on the subject for this

time frame, and the information provided below is based

solely on the memory of Do officers

familiar with

procedures in place at the time and in the specific

offices in which they served.

(U)

Each area division in the DO maintained and

staffed its own registry.

Although each registry was

configured to meet each division's unique requirements,

there were common functions performed by all the

registries to include: collecting, sorting, and

delivering of incoming cables; maintenance of incoming

and outgoing cable "chronos;" collecting and delivering

of incoming and outgoing pouch material; and the

issuance and maintenance of "pseudo and alias" card

files.

(U) On a daily basis, usually six days per week,

each registry collected its incoming cable traffic from

a central processing point, then called the Cable

Secretariat, within the Office of Communications.

The

incoming cables were then sorted by registry personnel

according to predefined guidelines. These guidelines

were unique to each division and were frequently

altered to meet changing operational requirements.

Sorted cables were then delivered to specific

operational/area desks. A "chrono" copy of each

incoming cable was maintained, on a temporary basis,

usually for 90 days, and the receiving office placed a

copy into an operational file based upon subject or

activity.

(U) Outgoing cables were created and coordinated

by appropriate operational/area desks and usually

released by the chief of the division or a designated

releasing officer.

"Released" cables were then hand

delivered or sent by pneumatic tube system la system

long ago dismantled from the original Headquarters

building) to Cable Secretariat for processing into the

Agency's communication network. "Chrono" copies of

outgoing cables were forwarded to the registry for a 90

day hold and the sending office placed a copy in the

appropriate operational file.

(U) There was a centralized processing section for

the directorate that received copies of the cables to

review them and

update the central index cards.

CIA-IR-37 - William Pawley

(U)

The DO provided an unclassified response to

the ARRB's request to review all files on william

Pawley and any files on his possible connection with

Cuban exile groups in the 1962-1963 time frame.

Agency's 201 file on Pawley consists of three volumes,

the same as in the JEK sequestered collection, and

November 1962 is the date of the last record indexed to

his 201. However, the Agency holds operational files

for the period 1963 to 1965 which related to Pawley.

Those files were made available for review by the ARRB

staff and they selected a number of documents for

inclusion in the materials being processed for release

to NARA.

Unnumbered Request - Worldwide Query

(U) In March 1998 the ARRB asked "whether a

worldwide query was sent out the day after the

assassination for all case officers to query their

sources for any information on the assassination and

Oswald. Are or would all the answers be in the

collection?"

(S) The following information has been identified:

A.

A "book message," that is a message to all stations

and bases, DIR 84608, dated 22 November 1963 (date/time

group 222054Z) was sent.
