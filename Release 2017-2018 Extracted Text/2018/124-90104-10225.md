APPENDIX

Details of Proposed Installation

Pursuant to Bureau authority, dated December 27, 1960, a

survay was conducted to determine the feasibility of install-

ing a misur on top hoodlum LA ROCCA's private office at the

North Star Cement Block Company, 12 Mc Candless Avenue,

Pittsburgh, Pa.

The survay was

successfully completed

and

provided the following information:

All known ways and means of establishing a misur were carefully

considered. In due consideration of all aspects of the pro-

blem, it would appear that a radio-microphone technique

employing the MUTT Transmitter is feasible and is the preferred

choice under the existing conditions presented by this case.

This choice was made in view of the following factors relat-

ing to the technical problems, security considerations, and

investigative advantages:

(1) It is recogrized that the use of telephone wiring disguises

are generally considered more secure than the use of radio-

microphone techniques.

In this case, however, telephone

disguises do not appear desirable because of

the following:

(a) Subject's private office contains two "hold"

telephone instruments while one "hold" instrument

is located in the General Office.

These instruments

are serviced by three twisted-pair lines which, accora-

ing to the telephone company source, run directly from

the Central Office to the cement plant. This condition

would, therefore, preclude use of the Bureau's disguised

four-conductor parallel type wire since the appearance

of parallel-type wire in an area where twisted-pair

wire is used exclusively might arouse the curiosity

of telephone company employees and possibly would be

also noticed by the subject or his associates thereby

presenting a security hazard.

In this connection,

is realized that a SPMT unit might be used to operate

a microphone or Mouse unit on one of the telephone

lines without additional wires.

However, it is also

realized that in using such a unit, it is necessary to

loop the telephone line through the monitoring plant

which must be located somewhere between the subject's

telephone instrument and the telephone company Central

Office.

Such an arrangement would require a local

monitoring plant and additional monitoring personnel.

(b) The possibility of using underground wires for

microphone egress in this case does not appear to be

the underground cable for a distance of approximately

made to telephone wires leading to a plant. Further,

the extent of the wire laying operations, terrain

conditions, and the factor of the industrial area

could possibly present security problems.

nitter, a transistorized AC powered minature unit,

together

with appropriate receiving equipment would be feasible in

this installation whereas previousyolder battery powered

equipment was suitable only for short-term installations

where operation for a few days would generally provide the

desired coverage. It would be expected that the MUTT unit

over an extended

period of operation might result in failure

of transistors or other components.

due to the

miniaturiatio the more ate and te cated Ac

mr suppo meter the traineer on power supple coul

be readily replaced by a smaller unit held in stand-by

reserve in the event of a failure.

It is belleved that such

an infrequent replacement could be made without constituting

undue security risks.

The North Star Cement Block Plant is located approximately

135 feet south-west of McCandless Avenue and fronts south-

east on an un-named alley (see sketch I) "extending from

McCandless Avenue south-west to 5lst Street. This un-named

alley terminates at both Mc Candless Avenue and 5lst Street.

The distance from the intersection of this unknown alley

and McCandless

Avenue to the intersection of Harrison Street

and McCandless Avenue 1s approximately 265 feet.

Subject's private office is located in the rear nooth-west

section of

the general office of the plant as illustrated

and marked in sketch No. 2.

general office and the plant are of cement block construction.

The roof of the general office is of corrugated galvanized

metal.

There is no crawl space beneath the general office

or plant.

The floor is solid cement and is not covered with

• 1o 229 cene

any carpeting.

The roof and interior ceiling are separated

by a distance of 4 inches at the northeast end and diverge

slightlyat a point where the general office connects with the

plant proper.

The ceiling rafters run in a northeast--south-

east direction. The interior cement block walls are not

panelled but are painted. Partitions in the general office

, are constructed of frame

and finished with a type of composition

panelling.

This composition panelling, each piece of which

is approximately 3 x 5 feet,

is also used on the ceiling

a I inch molding covers the joints.

It is proposed that one variable reluctance microphone, a MUTT

Transmitter and an AC power supply be installed between

the ceiling and roof at the point designated "x" on sketch 3.

Ingress to this point can be made by removing the ceiling

exhaust fan.

It is not known how extensively this ceiling

exhaust fan

is used, but inasmuch as this office is air-

conditioned, it is surmised that use of the exhaust fan is

limited. This unit would be energized by running a pair of

wires from point "x"

southeast between the rafters, to the

southeast wall of subject's private office and thence drop-

ping the wires down the wall making the connection to the

wall box of the designated electrical wall outlet.

believed that the amount of power consumption of the MUTT

Transmitter is not critical.

It is also believed that one

transmitter maintained in the ceiling will afford effective

maintained by a small staff of maintenance employees plus

three guards who alternate shifts.

Contact under pretext

with the manager of real estate for the westinghouse Corpora-

tion has assured authority and security in this respect.

It is proposed that a box capable of being locked be used

to house the remote receiving equipment.

This box will be

fastened in the afore-mentioned office

near other unused

telephone boxes in the immediate vicinity of a window for

disguise and will be energized through the plant's 117 volt

AC system.

The receiver's output will be fittee into one

of several available telephone lines, one of which will be

leased and conducted to the Pittsburgh Office Control Plant.

The receiving antenna can, if necessary, be extended outside

the window and will not be obvious in view of other wires

connected to and handing from this building.

It is believed that this radio-microphone technique is

technically feasible for the following reasons:

1. There is an unobstructed aerial passage between

the North Star Cement Block Company and the second

No othe

floor of the Westinghouse Plant; the distance between

these two locations

is approximately 475 feet (see

sketch No. 1) whereas it is believed that under ideal

conditions, the range of the MUlT might be as high as

one-half mile.

The receiving equipment to be located in the

office on the second floor of the Westinghouse Plant

would not be subject to temperature fluctuations since

temperature is maintained at a constant 40 degrees.

It is anticipated that the installation personnel would enter

the North Star Cement Block Company surreptitiously.

Prior

to this, all logical employees, associates, and relatives

of the subject, as well as the subject himself, who might

come to the plant will be placed under surveillance. They

will be surveilled during the entire operation. SA personnel

who are acquainted with subject and key employees of the

plant will be placed in strategic positions to provide.

Sufficient

personnel will be utilized to insure advance warning of any

possible approach by the afore-mentioned persons. It is

realized that trespassswill occur but every precaution will

be taken to prevent any possibility of compromise.
