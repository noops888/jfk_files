AMENDED COMMENT. i

This document was denied. The document is principally concerned
with repeating information received from the FBI which in turn received the
information from a foréign lik security Service under an agreement of
confidentiality, Because of the potential damage to {iaison, as well as foreign
diplomatic relations should this information be released, the FBI has xequested
that all of the information be withheld under the authority of exemption (b) (1).
Other portions of the document which contain information primarily of interest

to CIA are also withheld including comments on the substance of the FBI
information which if released would lead to the disclosure of the information the
FBI seeks to protect, information concerning the existence of an Agency station

in a specific city abroad, Agency internal filing instructions, Agency components,
Agency staff employees and Agency cryptonyms. The document is therefore
withheld under the authority of exemptions (b)(1), (b) (2) and (b)(3).
