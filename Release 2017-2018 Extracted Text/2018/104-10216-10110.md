F 1. Three ANTRUNK operations, the foremost objective of each of
which has been to re-contact AMTRUNK-10 to broaden the base

of MHAPRON recruitment in the AMTRUNK project, have been mounted

in 1964, Two of the three have been partially successful but 7
to date ANICE-~14, the AMTRUNK leader, has been unable to make
contact with AMTRUNK-10.

2. Operation ASTRUNK VI was mounted in January 1964. Thia
was tho operation in which AMTRUNK-9 and his family were ex-
filtratod. Tho unexpected presence of ANTRUNK-9's wife and small
children forced AMICE-14 to vacate the infil/exfiltration area
prematurely. All three attempts to launch Operation AMTRUNK VII
in February were unsuccessful largely because of rough seas and
the resultant difficulty in towing the AMTRUNK Intermediate Craft.
The firefight with the patrol craft in the first Stage of the in-
filtration phase on Operation ANTRUNK VIII in March forced the
team to wait out the alert which their encounter had precipitated.
The team was able to emplace the AMLASH cache and to add to it
an OWVL receiver with instructions and schedules for AMTRUNK-10
ag well as additional S/W supplies for ANTRUNK-10 and -11. An
S/W message containing the cache recovery plan was sent to
ANTRUNK-10 shortly after the team's return to the JMWAVE area.

‘(32 With one notable exception, the above failures and
partial successes have constricted the AMTRUNK effort toward
MHAPRON recruiting at least until AMICE-14 should attempt another
infiltration or until a subsaquent, ANTRUNK xecruiting team should
be formed. The one notable dyception,is ‘attempt soon tobe |
madé~to recruit Z Cubana pilot with
considerable influence in civil and military aviation and the
clandestine aspects thereof. |To this effort, AMTRUNK-13, a close
friend of for over 20' years, will be sent to Mexico City
to seize the opportunity to throw a recruitment pitch
during a Cubana turnaround flight. Discussions at JMWAVE between
