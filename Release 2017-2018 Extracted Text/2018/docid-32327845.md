known as’ Sally Burns, made a great deal of money running
guns to Cuba ahd is a very wealthy individual in his own
right. BURNS is allegedly the sole owner of the Marlboro
House at 50th Street and Collins Avenue, Miami Beach,
Fla. He stated that SALLY BURNS was partners with JOE
RIVERS and (FNU) ROTHMAN in transporting guns to Havana,
Subay - during the time of BATISTA. ROTHMAN's son owns the .
Candy stick, a "Twist Joint"-in Miami Beach. The informant
stated. that BERLIN told him that ROTHMAN was convicted of
gun running, but that SALLY BURNS and JOE RIVERS went free
