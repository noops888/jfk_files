Moscow Embassy report on the meeting that two U.S. exchange

Deputy Assistant Secretary, EUR on December 13, 1963, 1

2. Mr, Davis read the paper, said it was very interesting,
remarked that he could not recall that Martin's health situation,
in Leningrad had been the subject of press coverage. He said |
that the contents of the paper would be of interest to Secretary
Rusk and Ambassador Thompson. He asked if he could retain the

American professors had been advised by the Embassy to neither
seek nor refuse further contact with Martin and to report in

not object and that we could indeed forward the information
