Shep: Re HSCA request 6 July 78 (OLC 78-2491)

Para 3: We have no record of any transcripts or recordings of conversations of Jack
Whitten or Win Scott. If any exist should be in CI Staff.

Para 4: Annie Goodpasture wrote a history of the Mexico Station for the Western Hemi-
sphere Division not the White House. This history covers the period from the inception
of the Station in 1946 to 1969. There is very little material dealing with the Kenned:
ion but a great deal of material relating to
and operations not related to the HSCA investigation. It is impossible to san-
itize this tome and the "soft file" docyments do not exist. There is a bibliography but
again precious little pertains. 7
