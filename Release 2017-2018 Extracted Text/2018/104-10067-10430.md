Shep: Re HSCA request 6 July 78 (OLC 78-2491)

Para 3: We have no record of any transcripts or recordings of conversations of Jack

Whitten or Win Scott. It any exist should be in CI Staff.

Para 4: Annie Goodpasture wrote a history of the Mexico Station for the Western Hemí-

sphere Division not the White House. This history covers the period from the inception

of the Station in 1946 to 1969. There is very little material dealing with the Kennedy

assassination but a great deal of material relating to L

and operations not related to the HSCA investigation, It is impossible to san•

Itize this tome and the "soft file" documents do not exist. There is a bibliography but

again precious little pertains.

Where to now?
