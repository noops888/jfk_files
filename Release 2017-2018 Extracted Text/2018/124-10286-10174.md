Enclosed are the original and seven copies of an LHM

dated and captioned as above.

The informant mentioned in the LHM is NY 4047-S*.

The memorandum is classified "Confidential" because

it contains information from NY 4047-S*, a sensitive source.

The Washington Field Office is requested to contact

the Passport Division,

U. S. Department of State, to determine

the status of the subiects

passport application.

Since the possibility exists that the subject may be

going to Israel for other purposes than to accompany her father

since these other purposes may be quite significant in deter-

mining the scope of her Chinese Communist activities, the Bureau is

requested to consider contacting the U. S. Department of State so

that the subject may receive her passport. her activities in

Israel may then be covered

It is to be noted that Israel maintains diplomatic

relations with

Peking, and it would be quite significant if the

subject contacted the

Chinese Siplomatic establishment in Israel.(xu)
