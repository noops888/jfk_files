going to Israel for other purposes than to accompany her father

mining the scope of her Chinese Communist activities, the Bureau is
requested to consider contacting the U. S. Department of State so
that the subject may receiy sport.ypler activities in
Israel may then be covered

relations with Peking, andit w d be quite significant if the
subject contacted the Chinese Alip lomatic establishment in Israel, 4)
