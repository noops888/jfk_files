From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. MeCord,

Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William h. Marcy, of the Technical Division,

Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with

various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the

Agency's Audior itermeasures Program.24They conceived and developed

a unique techr'.

which is considered to be

a major breakthruugh in the detection of clandestine microphones and

other devices targeted against the Agency. It gives the Agency for 24

a capability for which the intelligence community has expended

large sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches.

This tech

nique will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations

at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies

in the community.

This technique was met with wide acclaim by the

intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures

Committee.

To further enhance the use of this equipnent, these

nen reycloped an inconspicuous, easily transportable package,

insisting of two attache cases which hold the

24

equipment, wall racks, and motor units.

This makes It

possible for an audio-countermeasures team

to enter offices,

residences, and safehouses without undue attention.

These men have shown great ingenuity and resourcefulness

in the application and development of this audio-countermeasure.

technique.

Through their further efforts in package design they

contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this

technique on a world-wide basis.

This technique provides the

Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in

terior mall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be

rapidly scanned in "real time" in the search for hostile tech-

nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance

the security of all Agency installations.
