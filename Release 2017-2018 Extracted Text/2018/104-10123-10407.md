From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division,
Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with
various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the
Agency's Audio-C ntermeazsures Program.z74 They conceived and developed
a unique techr’ in which is considered to be
a major breakthrough @ detection of Clandestine microphones and
other devices targeted against t Agency. It gives the Agency for 2
rst time the capability to;
a capability for which the’ intelligence community has expended
large sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches. This tech--
nique will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations
at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies
in the community. This technique was met with wide acclaim by the
intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures
Committee. 2y

e for an audio-countermeasures team to enter offices,
residences, and safehouses without undue attention.

These men have shown great ingenuity and resourcefulness
in the application and development of this audio-countermeasure
technique. Through their further efforts in package design they
contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this
technigue-on a world-wide basis. This technique provides the
Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in-
ior wall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be
idly scanned in "real time” in the search for hostile tech-
nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance
the security of all Agency installations.
