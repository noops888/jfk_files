22 November 1960

Meaeage from Droller
1. Under no circumstances will they (the group) accept funding via

AMRASP,

2, Military matter: They are very serious about 27 November, The

reason is two separate plans they intend to mesh into one:

a | oY

b. ‘Intelligence therefrom for the freeing of Matos, They feel
that the man in charge of the Matos prison _| This man wilt
probably be transferred in the near future, Also, there is quite 2 likelthood
that will bé trancferrod, Their idea is that _]prould go and
capture a fellow by the name of "Chino" then would make a very routine trip

with 40 men down to the place where the prizon is,with the help of

free Matos, and they are convinced -- and eo is Barquin, who fe their military
Nd

planner -- that with Matos free,"Chino" neutralized, land Matos can

control this particular area. The questicn is that they can control it but they
ean hold it only for a longer period of time if they are assured of ) adequate

‘ump resupply and b) it {a important that The Beard's" air support for this ores —

to be destroyed ff possible. The reason they have picked the 27th is that:

aC puto be transferred and b might not etay too long tharefore
thay would like to move rather fast. What they would like from us is:

(1) Certain intelligence data on air fields and mining.
(2) Advice how beet to neutralise the Beard's" air force.
(3) Bf we could neutralize the air force by dropping anti-aircraft
artillery to them,
3. While they will not accept the financing under tha AMRASP they aro
probably willing to have all this hardware support to be done in the name of

AMRASP and told me that the AMRASP pilots belong in fact to them,
4, I (Droller) left with them a $2, 500 check and left the matter in this

wayt that 3, a3 of todsy, cannot see how I could change the funding arrangement,
that I would get in touch with them about 1530 hours and find out aud tell them

whether or not they could expect further sessions with my military colleague,
Telecon from Droller

Note Droller wes still in the meoting at 1230 hours in an apartment and there
was no pay phono near, He will call back between 1400 and 3430 hours,
