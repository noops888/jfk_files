‘eystem:to the independent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up unused and
, Old .lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
laying. underground cables, eto. Eventually we should be better off be-
‘gaune: there should be more surplus lines. The renovation work has
‘hampered much of the LIFEAT work, principally because many of the lines
‘mow ape underground and we eamot get access to them before they enter
the-central.. This is particularly trun with respect to the Czech Em-
"pasty, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
Point we now occupy.

7 3. WILSTRD seid that we try to keep track of the activities of
‘i Intel" but since they seem to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no
prior waming of their presence in a certain areae

4. In the recent past, ‘axico has been using houses for listing
S posts for security reasons. ‘/e have more control over the access of

a phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. fHowevor, under new

: regulations, all new apartment buildings must have telephone lines in=
atalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
phase. This means that tho lines and their destination are concealed,
WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since
we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
Way that the phone company cannot trace ite destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then install a separate line to the build-
ing and hook up. the subscriber to this Line which, 4f checked, will
beleng to a legitimate subscriber.

Se One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two half
paisa then form one good pair which we can use.

6 WIISTED explained that it cost about 3000 posos to get a
reguler telephone. This entails the purchasa of a telephone company
bond, which later can be sold.
