"2, WILSTED emphasized that the whole tolephone systen in Mexico

'Aity la undergoing a reformation.

The company Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.,

has subcontracted this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone

systen to the independent firm, Intel.

They are cleaning up unused and

old 11nes, putting In new and spare Ilnos, redefining exchange areas,

saying underground cables oto.

Eventually we should be better off be-

cause there should be more surplus lines. The renovation work has

hampered much of the LIFTAI work, principally because many of the lines

#nON

are underground and we cannot get access. to them before they enter

tho contral.

This is particularly trun with respect to the Czech En-

basay, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage

point we now occupy.

•3.

WILSTRD said that we try to keop track of the activities of

"Intol" but since they seem to attaok "Colonias" at mindom, we have no

prior waming of their presence in a certain area.

Lo In the recent past, lexico has been using houses for listing

posts for security reasons.

ile have more control over the access of

phone company Inspectors or repairman to houses. lowever, under new

regulations, all now apartment bulldings must have telephone Ilnes In

atalled in the building by the phone company during the construction

This means that the lines and their destination are concealed.

WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since

we omn siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a

way that the phone company cannot trace 1te destination without tearing

the bullding apart and we can then install a separate Iine to the build-

Ing and hook up the subseriber to this line which, if checked, will

belong to a legitimate subscriber®

5. One system which has been used effectively is to take one half

of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two hulf

pairs then for one good pair which we can use.

WIISTEN explained that It cost about 3000 posos to got a

roguler telephone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company

bond, which later can be sold.
