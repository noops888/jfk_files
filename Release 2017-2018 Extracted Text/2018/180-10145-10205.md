BACKGROUND

In April, 1976, the Senate Select Committee to Study

Government Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities

(SSC) published their Final Report (Book V)

which in essence

faulted the CIA for its errors of ommission in not informing

the Warren Commission of the Agency's on-going plots against

the revolutionary government in Cuba and its attempts on the

life of the premier,

Fidel Castro.

The Committee's rationale

is detailed on pages 6-7 of its Findings, but one paragraph

succinctly sums up their position.

"Senior CIA officials also should have realized that

their agency

was not utilizing its full capability

gate Oswald's pro-Castro and anti-Castro connections.

should have realized that CIA operations against Cuba, par-

ticularly operations involving the assassination of Castro,

needed to be considered in the investigation.

Yet, they

directed their subordinates to conduct an investigation

out telling them of these vital facts.

Those officials, whom

the Warren Commission relied upon for

expertise, advised the

that the CIA had no evidence of a foreign

(p. 7, Book V)

Stung by the Senate criticism and the "rippling effect"

that Book V occasioned in the media, the CIA prepared

prehensive report in 1977 designed to answer, at least within

the Agency, the critical questions posited in the SSC Final

Report.

However, even the CIA's 1977 Report tacitly recognizes

the inadequacy of the CIA's narrow

response to the Warren

Commission's quest for all

possible relevant

information.

("Relevancy" is,

of course, the "buyword"

upon which both

the Senate

and Agency each

base their position

on the importance

of the anti-Castro plots to the Commission's work.)

On page

10 of the Agency's conclusions, the 1977 Report acknowledges

that:

"While one can understand today why the Warren Com-

mission limited its inquiry to normal avenues of

in-

vestigation, it would have served to re-inforce the

credibility of its effort had it taken a broader view

of the matter.

CIA, too, could have considered in

specific terms what most

saw in general terms -- the

possibility of Soviet or Cuban involvement in the

assassination (JFK) because of tensions of the time.

....The Agency

should have taken broader initiatives,

then, as well."

INVOLVEMENT OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN CIA PLOTS

TO ASSASSINATE FIDEL CASTRO

The genesis of the utilization of the United States

criminal syndicate by the CIA to attempt to assassinate Castro

is placed by the 1967 Inspector General's Report as occurring

during a conversation between the Deputy Director of Plans,

Richard Bissell, and the Pirector of the Office of Security,

Colonel Sheffield Edwards.

(1967 IG Report, p.

; Interim

Report, p. 74)

Edwards assigned the specific tasks of

tional Support Division of the Office of Security.

who had been previously

utilized by the Agency in several sensitive covert operations,

would be contacted

to recruit the necessary personnel.

Although Maheu and O'Connell differ as to who initially

brought up John Roselli's name

for consideration, there was a

between Maheu and Roselli at

is a memo to the DCI dated 19 November 1970 which reviews

the Mafia operation.

the Las Vegas Sun.)

Roselli, although apparently skeptical at first, agreed

to a meeting in

discuss further details.

at the time of Castro's visit,

Varona) that his visit had an assassination motivation.

The timing of the introduction of both

The principals in Phase I of the operation also dis-

agree as to the roles which were to be played by both

"Although Maheu described Giancana as playing a 'key'

In his Committee testimony, Trafficante

recalled that he made two trips to Cuba after his release

from prison in August 1959 and placed these sojourns within

two or three months

after his release from prison.

His testimony has some

logical

credibility in that all of the casinos in Havana were either

closed or operating in the red by mid-1960, and law

ment reports placed him in the Tampa-Miami

area consistently

during the pre-Bay of Pigs period.)

The observations quoted above of the 1967

I.G. Report are extremely significant in several respects.

First, the poison pill modus operandi originated with Gian-

cana, not the Agency,

a point which is crucial to the final

conclusions presented below.

Secondly, Trafficante is

identified as having access

to and providing for the

putative

assassin in Cuba which is inconsistent which his self-serving

role description of "interpreter".

His ability to recruit

Orta apparently was directly tied to his former gambling

empire associations which formed a constant pattern for all

his alleged conduct both during and after his Cuban days.)

(See Trafficante profile.)

(Comment: Speculation concerning Orta's role arose

during the Agency's 1977 Report when it was forced to address

a problem raised by an April 23, 1975 article, concerning Frank

Sturgis, written by Paul Meskill of the New York Daily News.

Sturgis was quoted as saying,

What was disturbing to the writers of the 1977 Report

was the fact that Orta's name had surfaced in connection with

connection by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The Report

references news stories linking Sturgis with Trafficante and

"gambling partner" of Trafficante's, Norman Rothman.

(See Rothman profile)

Coupled with Sturgis' alleged mob rela-

tionships is the allegation that Sturgis had a role in inspecting

the gambling casinos in Cuba on behalf of the Castro government

and could have developed an interest with Orta in receiving

gambling kickbacks."

A second aspect of Meskill's news series concerned a

claim of Marita Lorenz that she had acted on behalf of Sturgis

in 1960 in attempting to poison Castro,

which dovetailed with

the 18 October 1960 FBI memorandum on Giancana's electronically

surveilled conversation in which he stated that "the assassin

had arranged with

a girl, not further described, to drop a

in some drink or

food of Castro's".

With the failure of Orta to produce the desired results,

the project was at a standstill until, once again, Santo

Trafficante assumed command.

Roselli told O'Connell that

"Trafficante believed a certain leading figure in the Cuban

de Varona

was already being funded by the Agency through the

Revolutionary Front and was heavily involved in CIA planning

for the Bay of Pigs invasion which was imminent.

Interest in de Varona was also being expressed in

1960-61 by Mike McLaney whose advertising

agency was engaged

in promoting Varona's image in collaboration with McLaney's

friend "Chirri" or

The Lansky influence using the Cellini brothers

admission that Jorge Pujol arranged a mutiny in Miami in

approximately 1960 wherein Meyer Lansky offered to financially

"back" Varona's efforts to "educate the American people about

(See Varona transcript.)

The logical inference to be drawn is that both the

Agency organized crime, and other persons interested in

removing the Castro regime, had settled upon de Varona, pro-

bably independently, as an

individual who had the potential

of uniting the multitude of exile groups who were in a continual

internecine turmoil.

De Varona was understandably pleased

to permit both the U.S. Government and criminal syndicate to

offer him support and asked no questions

as to the

source of

the funds or the motives of his benefactors.

(See Varona

Although de Varona has no specific memory of meeting

Trafficante, the Tampa crime boss admits that he acted as an

"interpreter" in several meetings attended by de Varona,

Roselli, Giancana and other exiles.

These meetings were

by Rafael "Macho" Gener, a Trafficante gambling partner

from Havana who continued to serve Trafficante in Miami during

the 1960's.

Trafficante claimed that Roselli had previously

Gener, but this appears unlikely in

view of Traf-

ficante's long-standing friendship with Gener in Cuba, and

Roselli's admission to O'Connell that Trafficante would pro-

vide the replacement for the ill-fated Juan Orta, who had

escaped to the Venezuelan Embassy in April 1961.

Paralleling the situation at the Senate

hearings during i975 when Roselit's description ot tratticante's

role changed from his "courier" characterization in 1960-61

as reported by the Agency

to Trafficante's "interpreter" state-

is the recent interview with Gener who agrees with

Trafficante's Committee testimony that he was an

The net result in both

If ambiguity exists as to the specifics of the intro-

duction of de Varona into Phase One of the Castro assassination

plots, more confusion surrounds de Varona's actual participa-

tion prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion.

PHASE TWO

The debacle which marked the mid-April 1961 Bay of

Pigs effort curtailed CIA efforts with the mob to assassinate

Castro, and it was not until April 1962, when Bill Harvey

assumed Agency responsibility for the task, were efforts made

to re-establish contact with Rosselli.

However, the fact that the Agency was squeamish during

the Bay of Pigs aftermath to continue

to try to kill Castro

does not mean that the mob shared their

shyness.

Indeed, both

Harvey and O'Connell swore that Harvey "took over a going

The fact that Varona related the exact modus operandi

to Harvey as he had discussed with Edwards in Phase One (circa

1960-mid 1961) leads to the possibilities that:

Harvey was correct in assuming that he was taking

over an on-going operation in April 1962; or

The mob had been using

de Varona before, during

ter the Bay of Pigs and permitted the CIA to provide logistical

support and future protection against the Justice Department; or

De Varona was simply making up a story for the

Agency to gain their financial backing or in response to

directions from organized crime.)

The cast of underworld characters changed.

Although the 1967 I.G. Report characterizes

"Rosselli's man"

it is probable that this individual

was drafted by Trafficante who had provided all the Cuban

personnel previously used in the attempts and who still

possessed, in 1962, the most complete network of Cuban allies

in Miami and Cuba.

The termination of the CIA-Mafia plots was slow and

undramatic.

Rosselli, in May 1962, reported to Harvey

the pills and guns which had been delivered to Varona in

Miami in April had arrived in Cuba, and an unidentified three-

man team had been dispatched in June to execute the plan.

(Interim Report, p. 84)

During September 1962,

Rosselli related to Harvey that

de Varona was readying a second three-man team who were

"supposedly militia men whose assignment was to penetrate

Castro's body guard.

During this period, the

'medicine'

reported as still in place and the three men of the first

safe." (1967 I.G. Report, P.

However,

team never made Cuba

and a series of alibis were constructed

during December and January, 1963. Nevertheless, de Varona

supposedly collected $2,700

for the maintenance of these in-

dividuals from Rosselli who had received the payment from

Harvey. (1967 I.G. Report, p. 52)

In mid-January, 1963 both Harvey and Rosselli agreed

that "nothing was happening and that there was not much

chance that anything would happen in the future."

Report, p. 52)

Rosselli was instructed to ease his way out of

touch with Varona which he presumably did.

The last meeting

between Harvey and Rosselli occurred in Washington, D. C. in

June 1963, when he was Harvey's overnight guest.

However,

their meeting ostensibly was not directly related to any

assassination plots.

CONCLUSION

The available evidence suggests the thesis which, in

part, is tacitly

assumed by the Agency in its 1977 internal

Inspector General's Report wherein it states that, "It is

possible that CIA simply found itself involved in providing

additional resources for independent operations that the

syndicate already had under way...In a sense, CIA might

have been piggy-backing on the syndicate,

and, in addition to

its material

was also supplying an aura of

official sanction."

The relevant evidence is as follows:

1. FBI memo 18 October 1960 re: Giancana ELSUR:

...Giancana reportedly assured those present

that Castro's assassination would occur in November.

Moreover, he allegedly indicated that he had al-

ready met with the assassin-to-be on three oc-

casions.

Giancana claimed that everything has

been perfected for the killing

of Castro,

and

that the assassin had arranged

with

a girl,

not further described, to drop

'pill'

in

some

drink or food of Castro.

(1977 I.G. Report, p. 19)

Comment: Although the dates of initial meetings between

Maheu, Rosselli, and Giancana are subject to diffenent

interpre-

tation, it is clear that no plans were finalized between the

parties until sometime after October 18, 1960, the date pf

the FBI's intercepted conversation of Giancana.

The poison pills, prepared by the CIA at Giancana's

request, were not ready for delivery until late February-

early March 1961,

¿ so that it is difficult to see how Giancana's

November 1960 assassination plot could be a part of the CIA

operation.

Rather,

it appears that the mob had its poison

plan in progress,

using a mistress of Castro, to accomplish

the deed, when the CIA fortuitously happened

along to offer

its support.

The mob was then in a perfect position.

If their

private plot actually worked,

and Castro died,

then the

syndicate had enormous blackmail potential against the CIA

which it could exercise at the opportune moment.

their intrigue back-fired, then their position would be that

they were only attempting to execute the wishes of their

government.

Additional Comment: The

actions of Giancana's "hired

hand", Richard Cain, raise some interesting possibilities.

Given Cain's admission

to the FBI that he had joined the

Chicago Police Department and Sheriff's office while on Gian-

Cain's approach

to the CIA Chicago Office in

Fall bE 19%0 to volunteer information on the Cuban com-

munity appears a little more than coincidental. Then when

FBI files disclose that he is planning to go to Cuba for Life

Magazine (one story), and to "bug" influential Cubans in

Havana ostensibly for ex-President Prio (second story), the

coincidence becomes more suspect.

The suspicion is that Cain

was being sent by Giancana to supervise the poisoning attempt

on Fidel Castro.

Cain could be the

"assassin-to-be"

whom Gian-

cana referred to in the FBI memo of October 18, 1960 or he

could be the contact man for the operation.

(Tie in memo on Cain with Salerno's view which is

strongly supported by the evidence, that Cain was the

"missing

second man" in the Las Vegas wiretap of October 30, 1960.

Maheu needs to be questioned on this point.)

Cain continued to "volunteer" information and

assistance to the CIA during 1961-1963.

In August, 1963,

he offered information on the DRE Student Directory in Chicago

to that office of the Adenc.

In September, 1963, Cain reported to the Chicago

office of the CIA that DRE

was in a deal to purchase a large

shipment.

picture",

He was told by the Agency to

"get out of the

directive which is subject to several interpre-

tations,

including

the fact that the CIA was a willing

participant in the deal.

Again, on November 27, 1963,

now the Chief!

Investigator for Cook County Sheriff's office, gave the

some information that Oswald was in Chicago in April 1963

with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and had purchased the

assassination rifle in March 1963.

2. Recruitment of the Potential Assassin(s)

in October 1960 of a

individual recruited for the CIA pills was Juan Orta, a

secretary in Castro's Prime Ministry.

The identity of the "girl" referred to by Giancana

can never be ascertained but Trafficante was clearly

best position to recruit one of Castro's Cuban mistresses

to his multitude of contacts in the Cuban gambling and

prostitution circles.

It was common for American gamblers to have Cuban

mistresses and Trafficante, Rothman and Tourine were typical

examples.

Also, one witness told the Committee that Castro

was accustomed to arriving at the Nacional Hotel (owned by

Mike McLaney) unescorter on a regular basis to visit one of

his paramours.

Thus, it would have been relatively easy for

Trafficante

to have

arranged for a young woman to service

Castro and to attempt to poison him.

(Marita Lorenz is a confusing witness,

to say the least,

and her potential as a assassin recruited by

Frank Sturgis has

been previously discussed.

However,

she was also Charles

Tourine's mistress and, thus, could have been solicited to

activate the poison plot.

Unfortunately, Tourine is totally

uncooperative and Lorenz was not asked about her relationship

SURE

## Page 16

Page Sixteen

SECRET

with Tourine in Cuba

so that we do not know

the dates match.

Juan Orta, the man identified to the

Agency as

the gangsters' contact in Castro's inner circle,

was presumably enlisted by Trafficante, due to Orta's former

receipt of gambling "kickbacks"

One fact is extremely bothersome, however,

ing to gauge the depth of the mob's

sincerity in using orta

to execute

the assassination plan.

to the 1967 1.G.

Report (p. 28), Orta "lost his position in the Prime Minister's

Office on

26 January 1961, while planning tor

the operation

was still going on in Miami

and in Washington."

the official version Orta receipted for the pills in late

February-early March 1961 and "kept the pills for a couple of

weeks before returning them". (1967 I.G. Report, p. 27)

the mob was close enough to Orta to have pills smuggled in

out of Cuba, then

they had to know that Orta had lost his

position of accessibility.

The other possibility

exists,

i.e., that the pills never left the United States and thus

available to give to de Varona when he was brought into

the plot.

The question arises, then,

as to whether the mob was

pursuing their own assassination plot and the CIA operation or,

more likely, simply using the Agency for the

ulterior motives previously outlinea.

Turning to Phase Two of the operation which began in

April 1962, the same possibilities exist.

If Harvey and

O'Connell are correct in assuming that Harvey had walked into

an "on-going operation", then it can be assumed that the mob's

relationship with de Varona, which pre-dated CIA participation

according to FBI memos of 21 December 1960 and 18 January 1961

continued uninterrupted after the Bay of Pigs.

resumption of the CIA's participation, funding and material

support could,

once again, be returned to the Agency although

de Varona would continue to deal through his mob contacts,

Rosselli and "Maceo".

Due to the loose structure of Phase

the ambiguous nature of the operational means of attack, the

lack of identity of the potential assassins, the

reliance of Harvey upon Rosselli's word that activities

actually being carried out, the Agency's lack of interest of

ability

to corroborate Rosselli's information, the speculation

arises that the syndicate was not seriously trying

Castro after the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the solidification of

Soviet influence

Castro's Cuba.

Trafficante, Lansky and other Cuba casino owners must have

realized that the

"golden goose"

egg, and that fortunes were to be made elsewhere.

---

## Page 17

SECRET

the evidence shows growning Lansky influence in the Bahamas,

Las Vegas, and Trafficante projects in the Dominican Republic,

and a new opportunity for boil

operations in Florida with

the tremendous influx of Cuban exiles.

It was also abundantly

clear that the new Justice Department

program on organized

crime would never permit the

"wide open" Cuba of the pre-

Kennedy era

even if Castro and all his Communist associates

could be eliminated.

Despite the relatively useless business sense in

continuing the assassination

stantive way, there still was a percentage in "stringing the

Agency along". First, there was no expense to the syndicate

because the Agency was providing full logistical support for

Varona.

Secondly, there was the mounting pressure from the

FBI and Justice Department which had to be blunted, if possible.

No better weapon to accomplish this goal could be found than

to use one

agency (CIA) against another (FBI).

A brief look

this strategy at moments

- If protection was what the source

was seeking,

he could be better assured of getting it by a direct approach

to CIA for help.

Since AGency cannot figure an ulterior motive, they

decide that Rosselli

is drinking too much and talking to

Morgan, who is also drinking and talking to Greenspun (and

Pearson).

Comment:

Drew Pearson has not yet, as far as we know,

used two of his best goodies: the story of the pills and the

fact of the State Department meeting. (p. 127)

Comment:

See p. 112 wherein "Drew Pearson claims to

have a report

that there

August 1962 meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) which
