BACKGROUND

In April, 1976, the Senate Select Committee to Study
Government Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities
(SSC) published their Final Report (Book V) which in essence
faulted the CIA for its errors of ommission in not informing
the Warren Commission of the Agency's on-going plots against
the revolutionary government in Cuba and its attempts on the
life of the premier, Fidel Castro. The Committee's rationale
is detailed on pages 6-7 of its Findings, but one paragraph
succinctly sums up their position.

"Senior CIA officials also should have realized that
their agency was not utilizing its full capability to investi-
gate Oswald's pro-Castro and anti-Castro connections. They
should have realized that CIA operations against Cuba, par-
ticularly operations involving the assassination of Castro,
needed to be considered in the investigation. Yet, they
directed their subordinates to conduct an investigation with-
out telling them of these vital facts. Those officials, ' whom
the Warren Commission relied upon for expertise, advised the
Warren Commission that the CIA had no evidence of a foreign
conspiracy." (p. 7, Book V)

Stung by the Senate criticism and the "rippling effect"
that Book V occasioned in the media, the CIA prepared a com-
prehensive report in 1977 designed to answer, at least within
the Agency, the critical questions posited in the SSC Final
Report. However, even the CIA's 1977 Report tacitly recognizes
the inadequacy of the CIA's narrow response to the Warren
Commission's quest for all possible relevant information.
("Relevancy" is, of course, the “buyword" upon which both
the Senate and Agency each base their position on the importance
of the anti-Castro plots to the Commission's work.) On page
10 of the Agency's conclusions, the 1977 Report acknowledges
that:

“While one can understand today why the Warren Com-
mission limited its inquiry to normal avenues of in-
vestigation, it would have served to re-inforce the
credibility of its effort had it taken a broader view
of the matter. CIA, too, could have considered in
specific terms what most saw in general terms -- the
possibility of Soviet or Cuban involvement in the
assassination (JFK) because of tensions of the time.

.-The Agency should have taken broader initiatives,
then, as well." (p. 10, 1977 Report

It is not the purpose of this analysis to detail
the conflicting viewpoints of the SSC and CIA with regard
to the significance to the work of the Warren Commission
of the CIA's Castro assassination attampts and to resolve
the parties controversy as to the operations’ importance.
Instead, this paper seeks to present a comprehensive review
of all the facts, drawn from a variety of sources, of
organized crime's involvement or potential involvement in
the CIA operations against Cuba during 1960-1963. Certain
influences and conclusions will then be drawn upon the nature,
scope, and motivation of the syndicate participants in the
operations.

INVOLVEMENT OF ORGANIZED CRIME IN CIA PLOTS
TO ASSASSINATE FIDEL CASTRO i

The genesis of the utilization of the United States
criminal syndicate by the CIA to attempt to assassinate Castro
is placed by the 1967 Inspector General's Report as occurring
during a conversation between the Deputy Director of Plans,
Richard Bissell, and the Director of the Office of Security,
Colonel Sheffield Edwards** (1967 IG Report, p. ; Interim
Report, p. 74) Edwards assigned the specific tasks of
locating the right party to "eliminate or assassinate" Castro
to James "Big Jim" O'Connell, who was the Chief of the Opera~
tional Support Division of the Office of Security. Both men
agreed that Robert A. Maheu, who had been previously
utilized by the Agency in several sensitive covert operations,
would be contacted to recruit the necessary personnel.

Although Maheu and 0'Connell differ as to who initially
brought up John Roselli's name for consideration, there was a
meeting between Maheu and Roselli at the Brown Derby Restaurant
in Los Angeles in early September 1960. (Interim Report, D-
75)

Comment: Maheu seems the logical person to have
thought of and contacted Roselli for several reasons. In the

ia Maheu's CIA history and relationship to O'Connell
are detailed on pp. 74-75, Interim Report.

Office of Security file on Ed Morgan, Maheu's attorney, there
is a memo to the DCI dated 19 November 1970 which reviews
the Mafia operation. Paragraph 5 states that: "Mr. Maheu
advised that he had met one John Roselli on several occasions
while visiting Las Vegas. He only knew him casually through
other clients, but was given to understand that he was a
Ynigh ranking member of the syndicate and controlled all the
ice making machines on the Strip# Maheu reasoned that, if
Roselli was, in fact, a member of the clan, he undoubtedly
had connections leading into the Cuban gambling interests.")

(Comment: Confirmation of the earliest Maheu-Roselli
contact is gound in Roselli's FBI file and consists of an
alleged telephone call in 1959 from Maheu to Roselli.) (See
Roselli Write-up)

(Comment: Maheu and Roselli had mutual contacts in
Las Vegas prior to 1960, including Hank Greenspun, editor of

the Las Vegas Sun.)

Roselli, although apparently skeptical at first, agreed
to a meeting in New York City with Maheu and O'Connell to
discuss further details. (Interim Report, p. 76; Office of
Security memo from Morgan file, dated 19 November 1970) Al-
though the Inspector General's Report placed the meeting at
the Plaza Hilton on 14 September 1960, Roselli recalled that
the discussion took place during Castro's visit to the United
Nations which began on September 18, 1960.

(Comment: Tony de Varona admits going to New York City
at the time of Castro's visit, but it is unlikely that he was
in contact with Roselli at this time or (¢éStimony of de
Varona) that his visit had an assassination motivation. Ac-
cording to a 19 November 1970 memo to the DCI, it was at this
September meeting in New York City, that Roselli "agreed to
introduce him (Maheu) to a friend, 'Sam Gold', who knew the
Cuban crowd.")

G0024 (Comment: The timing of the introduction of both
Giancana ('Gold") and Trafficante ('Joe') is important to the
analysis of the "true" role of the mob in the Castro assassina-
tion plots. According to the 1967 IG Report, the entrance of
Giancana took place "during the week of 25 September 1960
(1967 IG Report, p. 18))

In contrast, the SSC Interim Report at p. 76, does not
fix a date certain for Giancana's initial appearance but (al-
though it was "certainly prior to October 18." (p. 76)) be-
cause of conflicting evidence between the 1967 IG September
date and Maheu's Senate testimony which set the initiation in
November 1960. As a compromise, the Interim Report reasoned
that Giancana had been introduced to Maheu “prior to October

18" because (1) the Las Vegas wiretap occurred on October
30, 1960; and (2) DDP Bissell had received an FBI memo, dated
18 October 1960, which revealed an FEIELSUR quoting Giancana
as discussing his involvement in an assassination plot
against Castro". (FBI memo dated 18 October 1960 from Hoover
to Bissell, Interim Report, p. 79)

(Comment: Each of the dual reasons listed in the
Interim Report on p. 77 are subject to critical analysis
which will be dealt with separately below.)

(Comment: Although the 1967 IG Report stated that
“Maheu pointed out 'Gold' to O'Connell from a distance but
O'Connell never met either ‘Gold! or 'Joe'", the Interim Report
disputes this observation by apparently quoting from O'Connell's
Senate testimony and stating that "the Support Chief, who
was using the name 'Jim Olds'," said he had met 'Sam' and
'Joe', once, and then only briefly. (0.C. 5(30)75, pp. 36-
29; Interim Report, p. 77))

(Comment: Conflicts appear also on several relatively
minor points surrounding the September 1960 meetings in New
York City and Miami. For instance:

1. Did Roselli know from the beginning that the
operation was CIA?

a. O'Connell stated that Maheu told Roselli that
they were representing international business interests
whereas Roselli testified that Maheu told him that
O'Connell was CIA (Interim Report, p. 76). Also, foot~
note 1 on page 76 indicates that Roselli told O'Connell
“about three weeks after the New York meeting", which
is during the Miami involvement of Giancana, that "I
am not kidding. I know who you work for."

The importance of Roselli's recognition of CIA
initiation is that it is doubtful if Giancana and
Trafficante could have been enlisted unless they could
be sure of government protection. This theme will be
developed mo re fully below.

2. Roselli told his Cuban contacts that he was an
“agent of some business interests of Wall Street that had...
nickel interests and properties around Cuba..." (Roselli; 6/24/

75, pp. 9, 17)

Cf. Jack Anderson column of January 19, 1971, which
stated that "Could the plot against Castro have backfired
against President Kennedy?....None of the assassination teams,
however, had direct knowledge of the CIA involvement. The CIA
instigators had represented themselves as oilmen seeking revenge
agsinst Castro for his seizure of oil holdings.”

SECRE

In Anderson's sources for this article were Roselli
and William Harvey, who was not privy to the details of
Phase I, it is another example of serious discrepancies which
exist between the CIA, Senate, and Anderson versions which
all purport to depend, in varying degrees, upon Roselli.

3. The alleged "surprise discovery" by Maheu and
O'Connell as to the true identities of "Sam Gold" and "Joe"
is really suspect. First, although it is possible that the
Senate Committee staff overlooked the specific Miami news-
paper Sunday supplement (Parade) which purportedly included
pictures of Giancana and Trafficante, thus graphically showing
Maheu and O'Connell the nature of the people with whom they
were dealing, it is a relatively easy matter to research
Parade magazine for the months of October and November. It = -
would appear that O'Connell and Maheu were looking for an ex
post facto reason for continuing the operation after the _
introduction of two of the top Mafiosi in the United States.
O'Connell testified that his discovery was after "we were up
to our ears in it" which is difficult to fathom since the
operation was in the embryonic stage and no pills were de-
livered to Roselli, et. al, until approximately March 1961.
Whatever, the reason, the Senate staff insists it could not find
the Parade article. (Interim Report, p. 77, fn. 1)

The principals in Phase I of the operation also dis-
agree as to the roles which were to be played by both "Gold"
and "Joe" in the pre-Bay of Pigs phase of the operation.

"Although Maheu described Giancana as playing a ‘key
role, (Maheu, 7.2.975, p. 34) and discussed his job as "to
locate someone in Castro's entourage who could accomplish the
assassination", Roselli downplayed Giancana's part to that of
a "back-up" man. (Roselli, 6/24/75, p. 15) (Whether Roselli
received a "message" from Giancana’s murder four days before
Roselli's Senate appearance is open to question.) Roselli's
Senate characterization of Giancana's role as minor is in contrast
to his alleged recountment of Giancana's due to his "knowledge
of the Cuban crowd" which the 19 November 1970 memo recorded.

Trafficante(s) involvement in Phase I is even more
jumbled by the available evidence. The 1967 IG Report and
Senate Interim Report state that "'Gold' identified 'Joe' to
Maheu as a man who would serve as a courier to Cuba and make
arrangments there". (IG Report, p. 19; Interim Report, p. 77)
To support the description of Trafficante as a courier, the
Interim Report quotes p. 19 of the 1967 IG Report in stating
that, "At that time, the gambling casinos were still operating
in Cuba and Trafficante was making regular trips between Miami
and Havana on syndicate business".

(Comment: This factually unsupported assertion runs
contrary to the evidence available through official govern-
ment records of other agencies. As an example, State Depart-
ment files reflect that Trafficante applied for a passport
in Cuba on October , 1959, and received that document in
Havana on February 7 , 1960. (See Trafficante file, State
Department) No records available to the Committee from INS,
State Department, or FBI record any later 1960 travels even
though the Bureau maintained decent surveillance on Trafficante
during this period. In his Committee testimony, Trafficante
recalled that he made two trips to Cuba after his release
from prison in August 1959 and placed these sojourns within
two or three months after his release from prison. (Testimony,
pp. 4-53, Oct. , 1977) His testimony has some logical
credibility in that all of the casinos in Havana were either
closed or operating in the red by mid-1960, and law enforce-
ment reports placed him in the Tampa-Miami area consistently
during the pre-Bay of Pigs period.)

i

By the time of the Senate testimony of Roselli, however,
Trafficante's role had diminished to a point even below Gian-
cana's. He had been reduced from "courier" to a mere "trans-
lator" and was needed only to facilitate conversation between
Roselli and the Cubans who had been recruited for the actual
assassination. Interestingly, Trafficante and Roselli's 1975
and 1977 Congressional appearances dovetail well but remain
in contradiction to the facts as they were being reported in
1963 by the principals.

(Comment: The Senate testimony of Trafficante and
Roselli needs to be outlined with a view to contrasting the
“courier vs. interpreter" role. My memory is that the Senate
did not vigorously cross-examine either man on this discrepancy
nor did the Interim Report "hint" at the problem.)

Once the actors had been assembled for the launching
of the enterprise, a discussion began as to the method to be
employed to accomplish the foal. ‘The Agency took the simplistic,
straight-forward approach of shooting Castro, but this plan
was rejected by Giancana. In a comment to its 1967 Report,
the Inspector General noted that "Giancana was flatly opposed to
the use of firearms. He said that no one could be recruited
to do the job because the chance of survival and escape would
be negligible. Giancana stated a preference for a lethal
pill that would be put into Castro's food and drink...Trafficante
(Joe, the courier) was in touch with a disaffected Cuban
official with access to Castro and presumably of a sort that
would enable him to surrepticiously poison Castro. The gang-
sters named their man inside as Juan Orta, who was then office
Chief and Director General of the Office of the Prime Minister,
Castro. The gangsters said that Orta had once been in a
position to received kickbacks from the gambling interests
but had since lost that source of income and needed the money.
(I.G. Report, p. 25)

(Comment: The observations quoted above of the 1967
I.G. Report are extremely significant in several respects
First, the poison pill modus operandi originated with Gian-
cana, not the Agency, a point which is crucial to the final
conclusions presented below. Secondly, Trafficante is
identified as having access to and providing for the putative
assassin in Cuba which is inconsistent which his self-serving
role description of "interpreter". His ability to recruit
Orta apparently was directly tied to his former gambling
empire associations which formed a constant pattern for all
his alleged conduct both during and after his Cuban days.)
(See Trafficante profile.)

(Comment: Speculation concerning Orta's role arose 5
during the Agency's 1977 Report when it was forced to address
a problem raised by an April 23, 1975 article, concerning Frank
Sturgis, written by Paul Meskill of the New York Daily News
Sturgis was quoted as saying, "the third (assassination) , schene
involved planting a bomb in Castro's office. I had acceés to
the Prime Minister's office," Sturgis said, "I knew Fidels
private secretary, Juan Orta. I recruited him to work with
the Embassy." (American Embassy in Havana).

What was disturbing to the writers of the 1977 Report
was the fact that Orta's name had surfaced in connection with
a Castro assassination plot, before revelation of the CIA-Mafia
connection by the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Report
references news stories linking Sturgis with Trafficante and
with a "gambling partner" of Trafficante's, Norman Rothman.
(See Rothman profile) Coupled with Sturgis' alleged mob rela-
tionships is the allegation that Sturgis had a role in inspecting
the gambling casinos in Cuba on behalf of the Castro government
and could have developed an interest with Orta in receiving
gambling kickbacks.”

A second aspect of Meskill's news series concerned a
claim of Marita Lorenz that she had acted on behalf of Sturgis
in 1960 in attempting to poison Castro, which dovetailed with
the 18 October 1960 FBI memorandum on Giancana's electronically
surveilled conversation in which he stated that "the assassin
had arranged with a girl, not further described, to drop a
"pill' in some drink or food of Castro's". (Memo, Hoover to
DCI A.H., DD 10/18/60)

The tentative conclusions advanced in the 1977 Report

are as follows:
y

It is obvious that many lines of speculation can be
developed, not the least of which is that the Agency did not
know the full extent of syndicate activities

Additional considerations:

: 1. Criminal syndicate may well have had some independent
activities of its own prior to CIA involvement in late
1960. Also, could have been on-going, when CIA reactivated
plan in 1962, April.

2. Syndicate operators could have had activities
such as these in New York Daily News stories in 1975 and 1976.

3. Frank Sturgis seems to have had contacts with,
but not a member of the syndicate. Could well have been used
by the syndicate.

4. Sturgis has not been a reliable source. He pro-
bably knew Orta in Cuba but he was outside Cuba when Orta
assumed role of assassin. .

i

If there was an earlier operation with Orta, it was

not CIA; could have been earlier operation of syndicate.

Sturgis could have known or been involved in syndicate
operation, or picked up gossip from Miami in 1965 after orta
returned there.

Neither the 1967 1.G. Report or the SSC Interim Report
can pinpoint the precise date on which the Agency processed
the poison pills which O'Connell delivered to Roselli. (In-
terim Report, p. 80) The chain of custody, according to the
1967 I.G. Report was for the lethal pills to be delivered
from Roselli to Trafficante. Although the next intervening
steps remain a mystery, Roselli reported to O'Connell that
the pills had been delivered to Orta in Cuba in late February-
early March 1961. (Interim Report, p. 27; Interim Report,

p. 80)

(Comment : The Senate Interim Report reported the version
of Joe Shimon whose memory was that the money and pills for the
operation were delivered at a meeting at the Fountainbleau
Hotel on March 12, 1961 attended by "Maheu, Roselli, Trafficante
and the Cuban." (Interim Report, p.81) Shimon's story is
filled with vivid details, which are documented on p. 82 of
the Report, but his credibility is subject to serious question
as his account is not shared by anyone else connected with
the plan nor is his relationship with Roselli, Giancana, or
Trafficante appear as "cozy" as he would lead one to believe.

It is also apparent that Shimon was a source for Jack
Anderson's column of January 19, 1971, which fixed the date
of the passage of the poison at the Fountainbleau by Roselli
as March 13, 1961, and contained the report that Castro became
ill a few weeks later.


Page Nine

SECRET

The real problem with Shimon's story is that the
pills were returned to the CIA for a few weeks because Orta  ~
could or would not attempt the poisoning; a fact apparently
unknown €6 Shino before his "leak" to Anderson and his
Senate testimony.) “** : gt Rais

(Comment: One additional fact concerning Orta's in-
ability to carry out the mission ties in with the final thesis
of this report. Orta “lost his position in Castro's office
on 26 January 1961, while planning for the operation was
still going on in Miami and Washington"...It would seem though
that the gangsters did know that Orta had already lost his
access to Castro. (1967 I.G. Report, p. 27)

With the failure of Orta to produce the desired results,
the project was at a standstill until, once again, Santo
Trafficante assumed command. Roselli told O'Connell that
“prafficante believed a certain leading figure in the Cuban
exile movement might be able to accomplish the assassination.
(1967 I.G. Report, p. 29; Interim Report, p. 80)

(Comment: The exile leader was, of course, Tony de
Varona, who was the subject of speculation in an FBI memorandum
of 18 January 1961 associating him with receiving financial
aid from American gangsters for anti-Castro activities which
pre-dated the CIA operation.

At the time of his introduction into the CIA-mob plots,
de Varona was already being funded by the Agency through the
Revolutionary Front and was heavily involved in CIA planning
for the Bay of Pigs invasion which was imminent.

Interest in de Varona was also being expressed in
1960-61 by Mike McLaney whose advertising agency was engaged
in promoting Varona's image in collaboration with McLaney's
friend "Chirri" or "Chilli" Mendoza (Mendoza is described in
Trafficante's FBI files as a close Cuban associate.)) -

Completing the picture of support for Varona is the
promotional efforts of Dino and Eddie Cellini, McLaney and
Lansky business associates, who were reportedly working
through a Washington, D. G—mubLic_celations ftom, raward kK.
Moss and Associates. Mos: jand
was supposedly acting as a conduit for funds supplied by the
Cellini benefactors with the understanding that this group
would have “privileged treatment 'in the Cuba of the future.'
Attempts to verify these reports were unsuccessful." (1967
I.G. Report, p. 30)

0021.58



Page Ten

The Lansky influence using the Cellini brothers
as a "front" is particularly interesting in light of Varona's
admission that Jorge Pujol arranged a mutiny in Miami in
approximately 1960 wherein Meyer Lansky offered to financially
"back" Varona's efforts to "educate the American people about
Castro, which may be a euphenism for anti-Castro plots
(See Varona transcript.)

The logical inference to be drawn is that both the
Agency organized crime, and other persons interested in
removing the Castro regime, had settled upon de Varona, pro-
bably independently, as an individual who had the potential
of uniting the multitude of exile groups who were in a continual
internecine turmoil. De Varona was understandably pleased
to permit both the U.S. Government and criminal syndicate to
offer him support and asked no questions as to the source of
the funds or the motives of his benefactors. (See Varona
testimony).

Although de Varona has no specific memory of meeting
Trafficante, the Tampa crime boss admits that he acted as an
"interpreter" in several meetings attended by de Varona,
Roselli, Giancana and other exiles. These meetings were ar-
ranged by Rafael "Macho" Gener, a Trafficante gambling partner
from Havana who continued to serve Trafficante in Miami during
the 1960's. Trafficante claimed that Roselli had previously
recruited Gener, but this appears unlikely in view of Traf-
ficante's long-standing friendship with Gener in Cuba, and
Roselli's admission to O'Connell that Trafficante would pro-
vide the replacement for the ill-fated Juan Orta, who had
escaped to the Venezuelan Embassy in April 1961.

(Comment: Paralleling the situation at the Senate
hearings during 1975 when Roselli's description of Trafficante's
role changed from his "courier" characterization in 1960-61
as reported by the Agency to Trafficante's "interpreter" state-
ment, is the recent interview with Gener who agrees with
Trafficante's Committee testimony that he was an intermediary
with de Varona only for Roselli. The net result in both
instances is to minimize Trafficante's exposure. (Cf. Fonzi
interview with Gener, May, 1978 and Trafficante testimony,
October 7, 1977.))

If ambiguity exists as to the specifics of the intro-
duction of de Varona into Phase One of the Castro assassination
plots, more confusion surrounds de Varona's actual participa-
tion prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The I.G. Report indi-
cates that de Varona attempted a second poisons} before
the Cuban. invasion but Roselli was positive that only one at-

tempt’ térla's) was made. He was also positive that he delivered



Page Eleven

both pills, money and supplies to de Varona which is cor-
roborated by O'Connell during 1961. The conflict is resolved
by the Senate in spec ing "that only one pre-Bay of Pigs
attempt was made, and . (de Varona) was the contact in
the United States who arranged for... (Orta)...to administer
the poison.

(Comment: There appears to be no factual way to resolve
de Varona's initial contribution to the poison attempts, es-
pecially since Varona denies ever having received poison pills
from Rossselli or being involved in any attempt on Castro's
life at any time. (See Varona transcript).)

(Comment: The Agency was aware of the possible dangers
inherent in having de Varona participate in the mob's plots

How-

ever, “steps were taken to end his participation in the _
syndicate plan but (they) were apparently ineffective." ! (1967
I.G. Report, p. 32))

PHASE TWO

The debacle which marked the mid-April 1961 Bay of
Pigs effort curtailed CIA efforts with the mob to assassinate
Castro, and it was not until April 1962, when Bill Harvey
assumed Agency responsibility for the task, were efforts made
to re-establish contact with Rosselli

However, the fact that the Agency was squeamish during
the Bay of Pigs aftermath to continue to try to kill Castro
does not mean that the mob shared their shyness. Indeed, both
Harvey and O'Connell swore that Harvey "took over a going
operation." (I.G. Report, p. 33) The exact details of what
that operation might have been has not been uncovered, but
Rosselli's ability to regenerate his forces in response to
Harvey's contact in April 1962 was immediate. Once again the
ubiquitous de Varona was to provide the individuals who would
carry the lethal poison into Cuba.

However, there were some significant differences be-
tween Phase One and Phase Two of the operation which bear
upon the ultimate question of the mob's motivation and serious-
ness in carrying out their part of the bargain struck in 1960
with the Agency.

First: In Phase One, Rosselli, et. al., demonstrated
their ability to execute the contract on Castro by naming
their source, who was, in fact, in a position close to Castro
to succeed. In contrast'/“the details of the modus operandi
and the ability of the putative assassins was deliberately
vague. After Harvey initially met Rosselli in Miami in
April 1962, Harvey reported that "the manner in which the
lethal material was to be introduced into Castro's
food (which involved) an asset of Varona's who had access to
someone in a restaurant frequented by Castro." (1967 I.G. Report,
p. 47) By June, 1962, after Varona had received money and
munitions from the JMWAVE station and had presumably sent the
pills into Cuba, "Rosselli reported to Harvey on 21 June that
Varona had dispatched a team of three men to Cuba. Just what
they were supposed to do is pretty vague. Harvey said that
they appeared to have no specific plan for killing Castro.
They were to recruit others who might be used in such a scheme.
If an opportunity to kill Castro presented itself, they or
the persons they recruited were to make the attempt -- perhaps
using the pills. Harvey never learned their names or anything
about them." (1967 I.G. Report, p. 51)

(Comment: As the 1967 I.G, authors correctly observed,
Harvey's tale of the “favorite restaurant" poisoning opportunity
was familiar in that Edwards had described precisely the same
plan."”'The fact that Varona related the exact modus operandi
to Harvey as he had discussed with Edwards in Phase One (circa
1960-mid 1961) leads to the possibilities that:

1. Harvey was correct in assuming that he was taking
over an on-going operation in April 1962; or

2. The mob had: been using de Varona before, during and
“ter the Bay of Pigs and permitted the CIA to provide logistical
support and future protection against the Justice Department; or

3. De Varona was simply making up a story for the 2
Agency to gain their financial backing or in response to
directions from organized crime.)

Second: The cast of underworld characters changed.
Harvey had insisted that Maheu and Giancana be dropped from
the operation which Rosselli readily acceded to. Trafficante's
"interpreter" role was assumed by "Maceo", a mysterious "Cuban
who spoke Italian" and who sometimes used the names Garcia-Gomez
and Godoy.

(Comment: "Maceo's" introduction into one of the
most sensitive CIA covert actions in history, without any
attempt made by the Agency to check his background or to as-
certain his identity is extraordinary. Yet, the Agency ap-
parently went blithely "to bed" with the top hoodlums in
the United States: without doing any basic background security
investigation. _

SECRET

Although the 1967 I.G. Report characterizes "Maceo"
as "Rosselli's man", it is probable that this individual
was drafted by Trafficante who had provided all the Cuban
personnel previously used in the attempts and who still
possessed, in 1962, the most complete network of Cuban allies
in Miami and Cuba.

The termination of the CIA~Mafia plots was slow and
undramatic. Rosselli, in May 1962, reported to Harvey that
the pills and guns which had been delivered to Varona in
Miami in April had arrived in Cuba, and an unidentified three-
man team had been dispatched in June to execute the plan.
(Interim Report, p. 84)

During September 1962, Rosselli related to Harvey that
de Varona was readying a second three-man team who were
“supposedly militia men whose assignment was to penetrate
Castro's body guard. During this period, the 'medicine' was
reported as still in place and the three men of the first
team safe."(1967 I.G. Report, p. 51) However, the second
team never made Cuba and a series of alibis were constructed
during December and January, 1963. Nevertheless, de Varona
supposedly collected $2,700 for the maintenance of these in-
dividuals from Rosselli who had received the payment from
Harvey. (1967 I.G. Report, p. 52)

In mid-January, 1963 both Harvey and Rosselli agreed
that “nothing was happening and that there was not much
chance that anything would happen in the future." (1967 I.G.
Report, p. 52) Rosselli was instructed to ease his way out of
touch with Varona which he presumably did. The last meeting
between Harvey and Rosselli occurred in Washington, D. C. in
June 1963, when he was Harvey's overnight guest. However,
their meeting ostensibly was not directly related to any

assassination plots.

CONCLUSION

The available evidence suggests the thesis which, in
part, is tacitly assumed by the Agency in its 1977 internal
Inspector General's Report wherein it states that, “It is
possible that CIA simply found itself involved in providing
additional resources for independent operations that the
syndicate already had under way...In a sense, CIA might
have been piggy-backing on the syndicate, and, in addition to
its material contributions, was also supplying an aura of
official sanction." (1977 I.G. Report, p. 20)



GUGet Et

Page Fourteen =a
SECRET

The relevant evidence is as follows:

1. FBI memo 18 October 1960 re: Giancana ELSUR:

...Giancana reportedly assured those present
that Castro's assassination would occur in November.
Moreover, he allegedly indicated that he had al-
ready met with the assassin-to-be on three oc-
casions...Giancana claimed that everything has

been perfected for the killing of Castro, and

that the assassin had arranged with a girl,

not further described, to drop a 'pill' in some
drink or food of Castro. (1977 I.G. Report, p. 19)

Comment: Although the dates of initial meetings between

Maheu, Rosselli, and Giancana are subject to diffenent interpre-
tation, it is clear that no plans were finalized between the
parties until sometime after October 18, 1960, the date pf

the FBI's intercepted conversation of Giancana.

The poison pills, prepared by the CIA at Giancana's
request, were not ready for delivery until late February-
early March 1961, so that it is difficult to see how Giancana's
November 1960 assassination plot could be a part of the CIA
operation. Rather, it appears that the mob had its poison
plan in progress, using a mistress of Castro, to accomplish
the deed, when the CIA fortuitously happened along to offer
its support. The mob was then in a perfect position. If their
private plot actually worked, and Castro died, then the
syndicate had enormous blackmail potential against the CIA
which it could exercise at the opportune moment. However, if
their intrigue back-fired, then their position would be that
they were only attempting to execute the wishes of their
government.

Additional Comment: The actions of Giancana's "hired
hana", Richard Cain, raise some interesting possibilities.
Given Cain's admission to the FBI that he had joined the
Chicago Police Department and Sheriff's office while on Gian-
cana's payroll, Cain's approach to the CIA Chicago Office in
the fall of 1960 to volunteer information on the Cuban com-
munity appears a little more than coincidental. Then when
FBI files disclose that he is planning to go to Cuba for Life
Magazine (one story), and to "bug" influential Cubans in
Havana ostensibly for ex-President Prio (second story), the
coincidence becomes more suspect. The suspicion is that Cain
was being sent by Giancana to supervise the poisoning attempt
on Fidel Castro. Cain could be the "assassin-to-be" whom Gian-
cana referred to in the FBI memo of October 18, 1960 or he
could be the contact man for the operation.

(Tie in memo on Cain with Salerno's view which is
strongly supported by the evidence, that Cain was the "missing



0002164

SECRET

second man" in the Las Vegas wiretap of October 30, 1960.
Maheu needs to be questioned on this point.)

Cain continued to "volunteer" information and
assistance to the CIA during 1961-1963. In August, 1963,
he offered information on the DRE Student Directory in Chicago
ta that office of the Agen

In September, 1963, Cain reported to the Chicago
office of the CIA that DRE was in a deal to purchase a large
arms shipment. He was told by the Agency to "get out of the
picture", a directive which is subject to several interpre-
tations, including the fact that the CIA was a willing
participant in the deal.
i

Again, on November 27, 1963, Cain, now the Chief!
Investigator for Cook County Sheriff's office, gave the Agency
some information that Oswald was in Chicago in April 1963
with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee and had purchased the
assassination rifle in March 1963.

2. Recruitment of the Potential Assassin(s)

In describing the putative poisoner, Giancana spoke
in October 1960 of a "girl" who was close to Castro while the
individual recruited for the CIA pills was Juan Orta, a
secretary in Castro's Prime Ministry.

The identity of the "girl" referred to by Giancana
can never be ascertained but Trafficante was clearly in the
best position to recruit one of Castro's Cuban mistresses
due to his multitude of contacts in the Cuban gambling and
prostitution circles.

It was common for American gamblers to have Cuban
mistresses and Trafficante, Rothman and Tourine were typical
examples. Also, one witness told the Committee that Castro
was accustomed to arriving at the Nacional Hotel (owned by
Mike McLaney) unescorter on a regular basis to visit one of
his paramours. Thus, it would have been relatively easy for
Trafficante to have arranged for a young woman to service
Castro and to attempt to poison him.

(Marita Lorenz is a confusing witness, to say the least,
and her potential as a assassin recruited by Frank Sturgis has
been previously discussed. However, she was also Charles
Tourine's mistress and, thus, could have been solicited to
activate the poison plot. Unfortunately, Tourine is totally
uncooperative and.Lorenz was not asked about her relationship

o)

GUO? TK,

SECRET

with Tourine in Cuba so that we do not know the dates match.

: Comment: Juan Orta, the man identified to the
Agency as the gangsters' contact in Castro's inner circle,
was presumably enlisted by Trafficante, due to Orta's former
receipt of gambling "kickbacks".

One fact is extremely bothersome, however, in attampt-
ing to gauge the depth of the mob's sincerity in using Orta
to execute the assassination plan. According to the 1967 1.G-
Report (p. 28), Orta "lost his position in the Prime Minister's
Office on 26 January 1961, while planning for the operation
was still going on in Miami and in Washington." According to
the official version Orta receipted for the pills in late
February-early March 1961 and "kept the pills for a couple of
weeks before returning them". (1967 I.G. Report, p. 27) If
the mob was close enough to Orta to have pills smuggled in
and out of Cuba, then they had to know that Orta had lost his
position of accessibility. The other possibility exists,
i.e., that the pills never left the United States and thus
were available to give to de Varona when he was brought into
the plot.

The question arises, then, as to whether the mob was
pursuing their own assassination plot and the CIA operation or,
what appears more likely, simply using the Agency for the
ulterior motives previously outlined.

Turning to Phase Two of the operation which began in
April 1962, the same possibilities exist. If Harvey and
O'Connell are correct in assuming that Harvey had walked into
an "on-going operation", then it can be assumed that the mob's
relationship with de Varona, which pre-dated CIA participation
according to FBI memos of 21 December 1960 and 18 January 1961
had continued uninterrupted after the Bay of Pigs. With the
resumption of the CIA's participation, funding and material
support could, once again, be returned to the Agency although
de Varona would continue to deal through his mob contacts,
Rosselli and "Maceo".

Due to the loose structure of Phase Two in terms of
the ambiguous nature of the operational means of attack, the
lack of identity of the potential assassins, the complete
reliance of Harvey upon Rosselli's word that activities were
actually being carried out;“the Agency's lack of interest or
ability to corroborate Rosselli's information, the speculation
arises that the syndicate was not seriously trying to assassinate
Castro after the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the solidification of
Soviet influence on Castro's Cuba. Being solid businessmen,
Trafficante, Lansky and other Cuba casino owners must have
realized that the "golden goose" of Havana had laid its last
egg, and that fortunes were to be made elsewhere. Certainly,

SeCRET

the evidence shows growning Lansky influence in the Bahamas,
Las Vegas, and Trafficante projects in the Dominican Republic,
and a new opportunity for ¢:/'-{ | operations in Florida with
the' tremendous influx of Cuban exiles, It was also abundantly
clear that the new Justice Department program on organized
crime would never permit the "wide open" Cuba of the pre-
Kennedy era even if Castro and all his Communist associates
could be eliminated.

Despite the relatively useless business sense in
continuing the assassination attempts against Castro in a sub-
stantive way, there still was a percentage in “stringing the
Agency along". First, there was no expense to the syndicate
because the Agency was providing full logistical support for
Varona. Secondly, there was the mounting pressure from the
FBI and Justice Department which had to be blunted, if possible.
No better weapon to accomplish this goal could be found than
to use one agency (CIA) against another (FBI). A brief look
at the record shows the employment of this strategy at moments
of crisis for those who participated in the plots.

knows more about certain details than we do,

in retaliation for U. S. attempts on Castro's life. We do
not know that Castro actually tried to retaliate, but we do
(CIA emphasis) know that there were such plots against Castro.
Unhappily, it now appears that Garrison may also know this.
(p. 127)

Maheu

Does have good reason for not wanting the story
aired further. Unfavorable publicity might cause him to
lose his lurcative client, Hughes. There might be some
value to be gained from endorsing his suggestion that he
approach Morgan and perhaps Rosselli and urge discretion.

-- The Pearson story, which is now causing us so much
distress, includes one detail that is only found in Phase

Two: the three-man team.

Comment: Not necessarily since Varona was involved
in Phase One also, he may have begun the three-man team
initially and only briefed Rosselli on the concept in Phase
Two or Rosselli just didn't mention the three-man team to
Maheu or O'Connell during Phase One

Comment: In figuring out "ulterior motives" for a
leak to Pearson, Agency makes the following point:

-- If protection was what the source was seeking,
he could be better assured of getting it by a direct approach
to CIA for help. (p. 125)

Since AGency cannot figure an ulterior motive, they
decide that Rosselli is drinking too much and talking to
Morgan, who is also drinking and talking to Greenspun (and
Pearson).

Comment: Drew Pearson has not yet, as far as we know,
used two of his best goodies: the story of the pills and the
fact of the State Department meeting. (p. 127)

Comment: See p. 112 wherein "Drew Pearson claims to
have a report that there was a high-level meeting at the
Department of State at which plans for the assassination were
discussed."

I.G. speculates that Pearson is talking about the 10
August 1962 meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) which
was attended by Harvey. (p. 112)

directly or at least discover how good
Government case against Rosselli was.

Calls from Rosselli began in October to
Harvey. Rosselli knew what Agency had done
for Maheu with Senator Long because Ed Morgan
told Rosselli.

Also, the Director (Helms) had sent Harvey a
news clipping re: Agency use of Giancana (pre-
sumably the August 1963 Chicago story by Sandy
smith).

Rosselli said that the leak came from Senator
Kennedy's office when Kennedy was still
Attorney General.

O'Connell sent to Las Vegas to find out source
of Pearson story.

Maheu admitted telling Morgan some of’the Phase
One operation due to Agency delaying on Long
Committee subpoena.

Maheuyisibly upset over Morgan going to Pearson
and asked if he (Maheu) had been identified as
the "client" by Morgan because he was afraid
of the publicity affecting his relationship
with Hughes.

Maheu denied discussing with Rosselli latter
Phase of 2:0* 39 and said he had no knowledge
of operation after April 1962.

Rosselli met Morgan through Hank Greenspun in
the 1950's.

Maheu recalled that Morgan and Rosselli met
with Garrison in Las Vegas during March 1967.

advice from Morgan but did not know the circum-
stances.
