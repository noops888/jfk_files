•By Dennis J. O'Brien

For the John F. Kennedy Library

O 'BRIEN:

I think a logical place to begin in anything

like this is just simply with the question;

when did you first meet President Kennedy,

or Senator Kennedy, if you met him before

he was

President?

LANSDALE: I don't recall meeting him before he was

Presidento The first meeting, wasy -I-belleve

the first Saturday following the inauguration,

whatever date that was. I was called into a

meeting in the white House by [Robert S.)

McNamara. It was a meeting, on, actually, on

a report that I had written for Dwight D.]

the personnel that were attending. There were

LANSDALE: Just before, that is, a day or so before. I'd

been in Vietnam for a brief visit and got back

just before the inaugural, maybe two or three

days, and at that time both McNamara and.

Gilpatric were in Defense getting briefed for

their new jobs. I met them at that time.

The outgoing Deputy Secretary of Defense asked

me to start working with Gilpatric, and so I

I gathered that there was some opposition to

my going out, and he insisted on it..

I'd like to come back to that. I wonder if

we could go on to talk about one of the major

problems, which is Cuba. When is the first

time that you hear about the Bay of Pigs

invasion,

not the Bay of Pigs, but the plansto

Sometime in the fall of sixty I think that

I heard of it about the first time that it

was brought up to the inter policy group of

the Eisenhower administration. I was the

Deputy, Assistant to the Secretary of Defense,

at the time, for Special Operations. and used

to accompany the Deputy Secretary, who was a

member of the interkpolicy group, to most of

Initially, it was. Initially, it was very diller-

on a premise that many people in Cuba were very

unhappy with the Castro administration and the

way it was turning away from the initial

revolutionary objectives and the capture of the

revolutionary movement by the Conmunist Party,

which surprised many of the supporters of

Castro as a guerilla and as a revolutionary

action. So? the thought was to back a number

of, Cubans who either had been supporters of

Castro or were very unhappy, were still resident

in Cuba, and to cause some overturn at the time.

borrowed some military personnel to help with

who had been attached to CIA for temporary

duty on other matters, and they hadn't come

in initially for this specific planning. In

December, when the planning had obviously

started coming in with a beach landing and so

on, the way it turned out, I urged at that

point to get military planning in on the

thing. I was worrying about it. Has a matter

of fact, Allen Dulles brought his planners

to a policy meeting, a policy group meeting,

and they were explaining the concept and my

questioning was such that Allen Dulles pleaded

with me not to spoil the plan at an early

a special section to plan along with the

the hell headed that?

This is yet in the Eisenhower administration.

This is all back in 1960. This was still in

the early planning stagedo this was before

training or anything like that was put forward.

When the JCS got into the act, I asked to be

disassociated with the project. I was

about it when it was surfaced with the inner

circle of

Well, I suppose you had some conversations

with Dulles and with Bissell and some of

these people about it.

LANSDALE:

Yes.

O'BRIEN: What's their feeling?

You already discussed

O'BRIEN:

hoid your criticism..

Well, Bissell definitely felt the same wayo

Bissell was a very hard-working, intenseperson,

almost high-strung type of individual. He

became rather impatient with my questioning

of the changed concept when it took place: I thought

Instally lI they had the corret personnel t

and they had a correct reading of dissent

inside of Cuba, that was a fair chance to do

something. My only concern at the time was?;

did. the CIA have the Americans who could work

with such a situation? I just didn't know

yes,

of any, but I was assured that there were such

Americanso but I'm not certain that there were.

Did you question the kind of intelligence that

was coming out about Cuba and the expected

reaction of Cubans to an invasion/

and the

reaction to Castro in general?

LANSDALE:

•Just in very general terms. :I didn't have

enough concrete and specific information

myself that was separate from theirs. Most

of the intelligence take at the time, avail-

able inside the U.S. government, was pretty :

colored with this dissatisfaction and state-

ments of it.

so? I had no real way of

determining the accuracy or inaccuracy of it.

Some of the adjectives used in describing this

in briefings to us alerted me a little bit.

It Just sounded, too much, file a sales job on

a viewpoint. I'd question that, whether that

was an accurate thing, so this is about as far

as I went

O'BRIEN:

How does a guy like Douglas react? Do you

recall?

LANSDALE:

Well, he approved of the plan, so he and the

others at the policy level approved of going

ahead with it? and developing it. I was his

advisor on this thing? (That was my staff job),

and I told him to be certain to get the JCS

to give it a real hard scrutiny and to come

## Page 12

up with details of whether it could succeed

or not.

That was my last advisory role with

him. I was taken off advising on the project

after that, actually by my own request because

I was apparently causing too much trouble and

iks of progress:

O'BRIEN:

the reaction of the Joint Chiefs, people

like Lemnitzer, towards this? Is there an

institutional rivalry or bureaucratic rivalry

here in their minds?

LANSDALE:

Somewhat, somewhato It was a little bit as

though, well, somebody's going to be playing

Boy Scouts, so this isn't really rivalry.

They had. a difficult time taking this really.

sand hussy: Later, I know, when the JOS got

much more serious on it because they had a

share of it.

O'BRIEN:

Well, do you get involved in the informing

of McNamara and Gilpatric about this? Do you

get any way of sensing what their reactions

are on first being informed?

policy, and asked me if I had any ideas on

how better the President could be served in

the policy decisions and arriving at them.

The thing was, right at that moment, McNamara

and I had come up with a proposal for him

which he put to. Kennedy. I just told them?

Well, I had some ideas but I had given them

to somebody else, and I was skeptical of the

Well; he wasn't tough.

He was the most inter-

would say on things and plague me with many

questions.

O'BRIEN:

How were his questions?

Was he fairly naive

about the problems?

LANSDALE:

Now, this was on probloms questions of how the

government would operate at a decision level,

and they weren't naive at all. He had a very

good understanding. He was very much concerned

LANSDALE:

O'BRIEN:

It was a traumatic experience at top lovels throughout

of the government.

I think it affected

President. Kennedy more than any other single

thing. It was almost a taboo subjectoif you

were going in to do business and to get an

approv:" :..

such

•- vuban affair. It

was

nan

Stonsoftly sore subject among all of those

people. I felt that almost all of the key

executives in the administration must have

arcant about at at night of something, and

during the daytime working hours they just

didn't even want to, contemplate it. And yet

they were honest enough people that they knew

they had to face up and look at it and would do

90, but it was an extremely emotional subject

with them, very much so.

well, in terms of the Agency, there's a number

of prograns and, of course, involvements in

operations that they have. Do you see any

shift in these, any attempt on the part of the

Defense Department to move into some of these

areas which they felt were traditionally theirs

rather than the Agency. I guess what

I'm

trying to say is, can you see any decline in

the Astiat influence

Yes, I think so.

I'm not certain that it was

well

the military as such. It might have been the

and

ds encouragement of some of the military who

were somewhat interested but wouldn't really

have expressed the interest unless they were

diroctly asked and there always had been some

feeling of unease, I think would be the best

word to describe it-among the military about

type of

any clandestine, operations. They felt that

once it got over into guerrilla type of operations

or anything that would involve a military subject,

that it would be far better to let the military

establishment of the U.S. handle it.

But that

would be sort of a dinner-cootail party typo of

a gambit on their part, rather than sitting and

planning and so on of "We must grab some of

that

this,

" Even though among themselves they talked

that way.

They didn't express it in terms of

thoir attendence at policy councils or even in

talks with people like the secretary of Defense

oy the civilian, exocutive side of Defenso. "on

this, I think that McNamara himself probably

well,

started thinking initially that this was a

military operation and just to be more efficient

and orlectivo, the military should take over

such things. I imagine that he talked that way

to some of the military peoplo thal vero seeing

him from the JOs, and. the Chiefs, and from the.

intelligence community, the military intelligence

community. I know that DIA (Defense Intelligence

Agencyl got its great start under McNamara, and.

I feol almost certain, I've got a strong hunch,

that the Bay of Pigs and the misreading of the

temper of the people in Cuba gave McNamara

great impetus in setting that up initially.

actually, wasn't a military ambition

sort of dealing with them, of categories of

work, and where the boundary lines of who did

what on the thingo and this is where their

jealousies and emotions and everything would

come up over almost nitpicking of boundary lines

of who would do what. It wasn't a thing of

Bay of Pigs, the DIA and its creation, a lot of

can do a better job than CIA," and in a much.

wider field than the service intelligence agencies

have done.

LANSDALE:

Oh yesyn.

They were being trained actually to

meet the challenge that the Vietnamese and

American top officials foresaw, and they were

thinking that this--and incidentally, the

French General (Paul) Ely before he left was

thinking the same way--just in terms of

contigency planningo they saw a lot of artil-

lery. and armor being given the North Vietnamese.

army. So, boing given that information, they

saw any attack or military trouble in Vietnam

as consisting of divisions of North Vietnamese

with a lot of artillery and armor coming

across the border. So they built up an army

to meet the foreseeable thing that was happening

that they thought might happén.

" Instead of

this, of course, it was more of the same old

story againpad there were many of the officers

in the Vietnamese armed forces who had formerly

been

since they had had is

this former affiliation

and had taken their basic military training

with the enemy, so to speak, they never quite

had the same stature among their fellow

Officers in the Vietnamese army, for example,

as graduates of the Vietnamese Military

Academy and the others coming right out of

high school and so on. Iso as a result, the

officers corps who were knowledgeable spot

of how to counter what was happening were

kept

at fairly junior grades, and in the late

1504

the highest any of them got that I ever knew

Inc

about was rank of Majoro and they had to take

orders from Colonels and so forth who had

served under the French in very much the

same type of a conventional military organi-

zation as the Americans had put up and were

advocating. And these

junior types who warted

to do different things were simply too junior

to do it and were unable to convince anyone

of the need.

So there was a mixup on a number of

there were meny individuals

Well, did Nolting ever

Vietnam, in an advisory position?.

I think so. There were a number of attempts

by the Vietnamese themselves, and unfortunately,

some of them werecouched in terms of wanting

me to come out as ambassador, by the Vietnamese

but Nolting and I had very friendly relations,

and I think he had proposed that I come on

Well, I was only in on the very original one,

which was to undertake some things such as

Another thing was on the police, of

getting police training done

so that they

could cope with meeting enemy units, rather

then doing urban police work. In this, I

was begging them to ât least get to a state
