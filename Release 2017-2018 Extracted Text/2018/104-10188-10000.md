1. Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of

concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known

Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mesico City. The Slation

in the past has undertaien this type coverage and will continue such

coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail

able for assignment to these targets. As lieadquarsers la aware, thie Station

can and will cover any possible target Headyuarters considors of high

enough priority to cover.

2. For éxample, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 195u, 1957,

1960 and 19ol; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue

the coverage.

PROJECT REVIEW

I. Produce of the Project

A. Sovict Coverage

As nored li last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage

of the officlal Soviet Installatton was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the

parallel lialson projeci LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target. In early

January 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the

most active Soviet Intelligence officers.

This was in response to the con

tinuing Station Cl program which includes the monitoring of Sovlet contacts,

and the guidance recelved from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT

renewil. As of this date, thts coverage has nor been active for sufficlent

tIne to fully evaluate lts usefulness. However, lt la bollered that such

field. Although nor designed to provide posttive Intelligence, some by-product

of thla type has been obtained. Samples are as follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journallst

by soviet Embassy

HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)

HMM-6376, 11 May 1962 (Refutation of Rumors that Soviet Cosmonaut

TITOV will vIsit Mexico)

B. Pullsh Embassy

LIFEAT has remained the primary source of Information on this target and the

nly successful,. continuing penetration of the target

C. Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was abie to provide coverage of major ftrms dealing In U.S. goods

transshipment via Mexico to Cuba.

This technical operation not only pro-

vided Initial leads witch alerted the Statlon to these compantes, but also

was able to provide continuing Information on the dally actlvitles of the com-

panles Involved. Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for Illegal

transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba was also provided including their con-

tacts and general activities.

Samples of the positive intelligence production

from this Cuban commercial coverage are as follows:

D. American Communists In Mexico

As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the

cake were passed :o local ODENVY for their processing. The most valuable

information gleaned from the targets in this fleld cont lues to deal with con-

tacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communist Group Ir

Mexico (ACGM).

E. Exile and Revolutlonary Activitles

LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups

acrive in Mexico, which Informatlon Is of the greatest value to the Station and

not avallable from other sources. The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this

area has been directed toward coverage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more

recently Spanish Republican exiles.

The product has been most rewarding in this

coverage. Examples of producilvity in this past project year:

HMMA -17489, & August 1961 (Alejandro GALINDO)

HMMA - 18420, 5 January 1962 (Teodora MARTEN Rodriguez)

F. Counter- Intelligence Information

By Its latest Related Mission Directive, Mexico City Station's major respon-

sibilitles continue to lle in the field of CI/CE matters. LIFEAT was able to

provide a valuable contribution in the attainment of the Station's objectives. in

this field. 'Coverage Included that on Carlos Humberto ILLESCAS, who la

acting In a covert liaison capacity between the CP and the Sovlet Embassy in

Mexico City. Besides the continuing operational support in the CI/CE field,

the following informational reporting was provided:

HMIN:- 5742, 7 July 1961 (Travel of Mexican Leftis:s Behind Iron

Curtain)

HMM-5836, 18 August 1961 (Activities of Mexican Student of the

University of Peoples' Friendship)

Bolivian Ambassador to Mexico)

HMM-6377, 11 May 1962 (Scholarship for Study in Warsaw to Jorge

TAMAYO, Jí., Mexican Marxist Intellectual)

G. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City

Station through production of leads unobtainable through other assets and gen

erally providing other Station operations the secure support only available

through a unilateral telephone tap operation. The following Is a selected list,

rogether with a brief description, of major contributions of operational suppor

and leads provided through LIFEAT:

---

## Page 16

LIFEAT/Cuban: The mos: noteworthy LIFEAT contribution to Station efforts

In the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the acti-

viries of Transcontinental, S. A. in the Illegal transshlpment of U.S. materials

LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities

of this company despite the etforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican

business community by changing the name it operated under to Inversiones

Mexicanas, S. A. and changing its location and telephone number. Valuable

information on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime,

methods and contaces used in their procurement. and information on the con

tacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained.

LIFEAT/Czechoslovaklan: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech

Intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacis, but more impor-

tantly, provided greater security to KUBAR K when one of their CLS officers,

Miloslav CECH, was singled out for a defection attempi.. Through LIFEAT

"Ilvemonitoring" of bosh the original and followup defection attempts, the

KUBARK assets were provided maximum protection from possible attempts

by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapment of the KUBARK per-

sonnel Involved.

LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the mos: "classic" example of the use of a telephone

tap in providing a lead which could deveiop into a vital penetration of the Polish

intelligence occurred recently in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT

provided the initial leads which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an

operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's develop-

ment of the operation. It is the Station's opinion that this one instance of service

by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire projeci for the year. (Full

information forwarded in MEXI 0462 and MEXI 0463). Also of great interest

to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ,

Attache of the Polish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which

had been stolen in the U.S, and driven to Mexico. In this operation, in whick

a defection attempe was considered, LIFEAT provided no: only the initial leads,

but also daily operational information vital to the Sarion's efforts in this case.

LIFEAT/ Yugoslavian: In this coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is

providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against this targer.

data on personalities, contacis, and services obtained by the target establish-

inent must be provided. I is :his exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared

to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this

coverage progresses. The interested case officer, noring LIFEAT is his only

present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and wul

---

## Page 17

6

continue to provide in this area is vital and basic to the mounting öf any

operations against the Yugoslay target.

LIFEAT/Soviet /Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed sup-

porting information in backing Station double agent operations.

In this area

the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the

agent. LIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case

officer to determine the veracity of the agent involved. LIFEAT also provides

a needed check upon the activities of the double agent.

LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: LIFEAT coverage of Spanisi Republican exiles

in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activitles of the various

groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the

senior ODACID official in Mexico. LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile

factiong both involved in planning this attempt and those opposed to it. Coverage

of targets in this area also enables che Station to keep abreast of the plans and

activities ofte varlous groups which make up the Spantsh Republican exile

community in Mexico City.

LIFEAT/CICE Coverage: LIFEAT leads In this area are exploited in the re

porting or travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and Iron ?

Curtain countries, and the travel of U.S. citizens, especially Communists and

Leftists, to Cuba. Through coverage of the American Communist Group in

Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amount of

information on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who

reside in the U.S. One of the noteable items in this regard is providing data

on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted "Hollywood Ten" to rega in their

former status in the U.S. film industry.

Finally, änd certainly not of least importance, Station security has been enhanced

through LIFEAT perlodic coverage of former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK-1

and LIVESTUCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or

personnel. Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially

valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations.

H. Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Station

operations, the CI/CE Information and leads, and the ability of the unilateral

LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets without revealing Station interest

to the liaison forces, well justify the expenditure of funds, time, personnel,

and Security risk. "As it has been noted in the past, that even with the Station's

envolvement in the parallel; but liaison, LIENVOY operation, a change in

atritude by the present local government auministration or a change in goveri-

ment administrations could end KUBARK participation in that liaison project.

For that reason, LIFEAT, in addition to maintaning its present heavy coverage,

must be available to once again undertake coverage of the official Sovler and

Czech officlal targets in Mexico City. Therefore, LIFEAT's present orientation,

though coward supporting Station operationa and Cl/CE mission rather than coward

argets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily avallable for"

recall into the Sovlet-Czech coverage: It Is the Station's firm opinion that the

LIFEAT project provides a substantlal and vital contribution in fulfilling the

several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

I. Thère is attached a list of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material

during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the project's

prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations.

Il. Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIFEAT Projeci are of a continuing nature and are there-

fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time.

For this

reason percentage figures as to compleilon of project objectives cannor be drawn.

However, an Indication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment

of the objectives can be noted in that 14, 000 pages of raw text were produced

in the period July 1901 through May 1962. LIFEAT has been in daily operation

during the review period with the average number of lines covered per month

being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered.

Ill. Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to re-

main uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of a great portion

of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target... such as Soviet

Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need arise

for LIFEAT lo again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so.

Until such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employ-

ment of its assets, especially in the areas in which the Station does nor wish to

reveal its interest or operations to the.liaison forces involved in the LIENVOY

operation.

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing

LIFEAT assets in "hot mike operations which require access to relephone

centrals and cables. The feasibility of using LIFEAT in this type of operation

has already been proven, in a recent operation with the LIERODE installation

as a target. Seven reels of "hot mike"

take were obtalied in test runs on

checking both the operation (Including Installatlon of the "miked" Instrument

In the office of the head of the LIERODE official Installation) and the equipment

which was of radical design and conceived and built by tie KURIOT techniclan

assigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover.

Unfortunately, before con-

tinuous operation could get underway, the LIERODE installation decided upon

complete renovation of its telephone system, including the Installällon of a

switchboard.

This, at least temporarily, precludes further operation against

this particular target, unless a direct line is installed there. However, it is

the Intention of the Station to attempt coverage of other targets of interest. In

these plans LIFEAT plays the key role in Installation, line and serles cross.

maintenance,

basehouse procurement and maintenance, and processing of také.

From the brief rest runs vla the LIERODE operation noted above, it is believed

that "hot mike" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatly ald

the Station in lis coverage of responsibilitles under its present Related Mission

Directive.

IV. Performance of Agents

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex con-

tinued to be good during the per lod of the project review, with security being

stressed in all phases of the operation. No security problems were encountered

which were not solved by the personnel involved. Since the success of the

LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Head-

quarters clearances and evaluation of now personnel will continue to le soughi

on those new additions who pass a strict field assessment.

V. Expenditures

Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted $ September 1961 for FY

1962 in the amount of $98, 973.03. The proposed budget for FY 1953 ls broken

VI. Status of Commitments

There are no commitments other than those note in the projec: outline subinitte

erewith and in the individuals contracts and oral agreements (memoranda ol

oral agreements were forwarded as necessary) of the various LIFEAT personnel.

PROJECT LIFEAT

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

1. Aréa of Operations

This operation is run from Mexicó City Station and is concerned with targets

located within Mexico Cly.

2 Purpose

The purpose of thia project Is to provide, unilaterally, dally Information on che

actlvitles of official forelgn installations in Mexico and the personnel thereof,

as well as coverage of the acrivitles of selecied Individuals and groups in response

to böth Station needs and Hendquarters requests. Presently, LIFEAT stresses

fexibility of coverage with support of Station operatlong and CICE coverage

recelving the greatest emphasts.

3. Buckground

Project LIFEAT was originated on. 3.October 1950 as a unlateral telephone tap

operation. Actual inklation of operations under this authority occurred on 18

January 1951, and the operation has run continuou. ly from that date. The pro-

Ject was opened with the installation of a single tap ard has grown In the past

cleven years to coverage of as many as thirty lines In a given month.

The LIFEAT Project is a unilateral operation completely independent from any

Ilalson arrangement.

It ls staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the ma.

Jority of personnel being Indigenous controlled agents.

During the past eleven years, Project LIFEAT has produced more than 83, 500

(estimate) pages of operational and intelligence information in direct support of

Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and contributed materlally to the in-

telligence gathering activities connecied with the Sovlet-Satellite Bloc and more

recently with the Cuban representatives in Mesico. In addition, LIFEAT has

been of considerable value in monitoringthe acrivitles of the American Communist

Group in Mexico (ACCM), as well as the activitles of the exile groups and local

Communists.

---

## Page 22

With the LIENVOY's assumption of coverage of the Sovlet and Czechoslovaklan

offickal Installations in July 1960, LIFEAT assets were released from continuous

coverage of these swo targets.

These assets were then employed In direct

support of Station operatlong--a role Ideally sulted for a untlateral operation

such as LIFEAT, and extremely Important to the security and success of

Station operations. LIFEAT, after spending much of Project Ycar 1961 - 1962

programing to this now role and redirecting its assets, has now adjusted to

this role and la fully employed in this vital asaignment.

d. Coordinate information received from the LIFEAT covcrage with other

Statlon opcrations, and coordinate as necessary with the Station personnel re-

sponsible for the parallel LIENVOY operation.

e.

1. Maintain supervistor. over baschouses, equipment, and training of

personnel assigned to the LIFEAT operations.

8. Coordination

a, Information produced by LIFEAT, primarily a Station operational sup-

port asset, Is closely coordinated with other operations of the Mexico City

Station.

No operailonal coordination Is required with any oiher geographical

arer, but they are advised of any information produced by LIFEAT which may

be of interest to them,

b. Project LINOG which supports the principal "outsle" Case Öfficer,

Duvid M. WILSTED, Is effected In coordination with Project LIFEAT.

c. Coordination with the parallel, but llaison project - LIENVOY, Is

closely coordinated between the responsible Case Officers of both projects,

particularly relating to the division of coverage berween the two operatlong,

thereby assuring that the unilateral LIFEAT operation will not be endangered

by the indigenous personnel of the LIENVOY operation.

9. Personnel

a. Career and Contract Agents

(1) David M. WILSTED (201-009195), principal outside" Case Officer.

(2) Wayne C. DRABAND (201-255095), outside assisiant to David

M. WILSTED. DRABAND was introduced into the LIFEAT opera-

tion in November 1961 as a replacement for Ralph B. RAFANELLI

who was transferred from Mexico PCS in the fall of 1961.

His OA

wis amended 14 November 1961 to cover his use in the LIRBAT

Project. Although DRABAND possessed only limited knowledge of

clandestine activity when first employed, under WILSTED's Instruc-

cion and Case Officer guldance, plus his own willingness and capacity

for work, it appears he will prove a valuable aduition to the

LIFEAT complex.

During the past project year the following personnel were dropped

from Project LIFEAT:

(1) Ralph B. RAFANELLI (201-175295), staff agent, was reassigned

PCS after completing his second tour in Mexico on 8 October

1961.

(2) Olivia N. GLADMON (20I-117751), LIFEAT processor, has given

notice that due to her planned return to the Unlted States for

necessary eye surgery during June 1962, her employment with

LIFEAT must be terminated.

Agent quit-claim and secrecy

agreement have been executed.

(3) Leona C. GANDARA (201-225710), employed by LIFEAT only

for standby support during the pass year and one half, now

Is employed for support and clerical work for MKCHARITY.:

(*) LIFEUD-20, (formerly LIMITATION-5), (201- 102308). and

LIFEUD-21, formerly LIMITA TOV-6 (201-117951) will be ter-

minated as of the end of the present LIFEAT project year (30

June 1962). Plans for use of this couple as baschousekeupers

were cancelled when LIFEUD 22 and LIFEUD-23, who are more

desirable cholces, became avallable fur LIFEAT use. Ter-

mination has been discussed fully with these indigenous agents,

and ¿erminatlon arrangements were accomplished on a friendly

and mutually agrecable basis (as in all LIFEAT terminatlons,

separatlon Is made on the baste of Mexican cus:om and/or law).

10, Operatlonal Clearances

See Section 9 above.

II. Cover

There are no changes in the cover of personnel who have been previously em-

ployed in the LIFEAT operation. With the new agents employed since the last

project renewal, cover is as follows: •

a U.s. guvernment agency.

b. LIEMBR.ACE-8 has natural over of a retired U.S. businessman

c. LIFEUD-22 has natural cover of a Cuban exile employed by a

Mexican firm In Mexico City. He works regular hours at hia

and after work and during lunch hours.

d. LIFEUD-23, the mother of LIFEUD-22, has natural cover of

housekeeper for her. son and performs her LIPEAT du les

12. Contact and Communicatlong

Dolly contact Is malntained between the Case Officer and the agenis employed in

the project.

These contacia are made In a clandeeine manner with varying

patterns established for car pickups, foot contacte, and emergency meetlngs.

Pree trang or a le reel to be patind me accomplished the mentine.

trance to the basehouses by other than the baschousekeepers la made only on the

basis of sirict necessity; such as need for equipment repair, installation for

new line coverages, or line coverage cut off,

Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents Is lept to a min-

Imum. Pre-arranged open code Is use for phone conversations between Case

Officere and agents. Alternate and emergency communications have been arranged

and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them.

These systema of contace and communication appear suitable for the project

and function adequately from the security and utility standpolnis. Locations and

times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequenily to decrease

the possibility of arousing the susplcions of the residents of areas in which meet-

ings are held.

13. Control and MotIvation

Control and mutivation are primarlly based ón two factors: ideology and

financial galn.

A secondary factor la the fear of reprisal from the local

police should discovery occur.

14. Securlty

During the pas: project year there were no Incldents which were beyond the

capability of the personnel Immedlately Involved to Isolate and remedy Im

medlately. In contrast to previous years, there was no Instance of telephone

work crews approaching a basehouse to check or reinove the tap lines runting

no that baschouse.

Some of the "crosses" made In the telephone cen:rals

have been removed by the central's workmen, but these arc of no danger lo

the operation unleas a full Investigation is made of one of these unusual con-

During the past project years no such Investigation has been under-

raken, and no susplolon of the LIFEAT linemen has been revealed to date.

As for the past few years the elephone company is continuing les efforts toward

modernizarlos of the Mexico City telephone system. This effort includes

changing from overhead lines io underground cables, cleaning off of the

unused overhead "dead lines" and Installation of new equipment throughour

the city.

These Innovations will continue to cause security problems for ike

LIFEAT complex, but it is belleved that theie problems are ror Insurmountable.

To mect this challange to LIFEAT security and to prepare for the day when

access to ¿elephone distribution lines Is further reduced by their placement

in underground cables, LIFEAT has recently succeeded in having one of its

lInemen (LIFEUD-2) selected to artend a four month special course in cable

work. When he completes this course (in July 1962), LIFEUD-2 will have

working access to all cableways and cable rermination boards in Muxico Cly.

This accesg will be Invaluable from both the present security and operational

standpoints as well as for the future when LIFEAT will be forced to tap directly

from the underground telephone cables. Ay a standard procedure the LIFEAT

personnel continuously work to devise new methods to Increase security, as

well as train in security procedures, so as to continue the high level of security

enjoyed by LIFEAT In the past.

15. Training

Initial training of new personnel and continuing refresher training for the ex-

perienced personnel are handled primarily by the "outside" case officer, David

M. WILSTED. Minor repair aud maintenance of equipnient as well as emergency

security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed with the agents.

16. Egulpment and Support

As noted in last year's renewal request, LIFEAT equipment la generally old

and much of lt ls now ubsolute.

With funds provided in last year's renewal,

LIFEAT (within the past mont:) has begun to acquire some new equipment,

particularly audlo recorders. A review of the equipment situation in the

LIFEAT setup has convinced both WILSTED and the responsible Case Officer

that a near-complete.modernizatlon.program uf the equipment used in

LIFEAT must be undertaken during the coming project year.

"The-local

KURIOT techniclan has on a number of ocasalons expressed his amazement

at the superlor product produced by LIF EAT with the surmoded and anclent

equipment (In terms of use hours) which the LIFEAT complex had to rely on.

Therefore, with the funds requested In Part Il of this renewal request.

LIFEAT should be completely equipped with adequate gear, particularly audio

and dial tape recorders, by the expiration of BY 1953. Admittedly, there Is

Involved large, one-tlme expenses In complete replacement of such expensive

"ems during a single project year. However, It 18 a necessary move. due

entlrely to great wear borne by the equipment. This wear is now causing such

a rash of breakdowns that the outside prinelpal agent must spend a dlspropor-

tonate amount of his time in maintenance work.

17: Timetable

LIFEAT has been In almost constant operation since lis Inception In January

1951, and u8 a vital Station operational support asset, lt Is planned to continue

l8 Indefinkely.

PROJECT OUTLINE, PART I

18. Estlmated Costa

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1962.

All figures are

U.S. dollars por year ($US 1.00 equals 12,50 MexIcan pesos). Changes In

cailmated costs for parilcular licma will be noted. Thoge reflect not only the

contInued Inflarionary trend In the Mexican economy, but also the shift In op-

erational emphasia from prime coverage of sover/Satellie activities to sup-

port of Staton operatlong. In this latter case particular line coverage ls of

shorter duration, causing greater expense in Installation and removal of tap

Ilner and crouses. In the agent salary category toral expense in contract

agent salaries has been reduced somewhat, due primarily to dropping certan

contract agence, while expenses for fleld agent category has risen, due to

the granting during past project year of long overdue salary ralses to all but

three LIFEAT fleld agents.

Indigenous personnel of the LIB"/OY operation; and, (2) the dally

basehousekeeper Carol K. YES ZISTER.

The Station belleves this

latter point does not

"cross" operations unnecessarily since

ZINSISTER's long and discrete cervice within the. LIFEAT complex

nIves her both the sense of security and the background noceesery

for secure ¿rocessing, of tre Soviet

Soviet micrial is not returnal to the liaisos forces afüor receipt

from ZHGwIsten, but 1s rocurned to the Station where It ls munmarized

and indeed

esseutial, in her LIFEAT caschousekcerer assignement because of her

experience in cooline vith the security problems arising irom con-

H. Counter-Intelligence Inforination

CI/CE matters continued to constitute a major potion of the

Mexico City Station's priority objectives during the review period.

Projeci LIFEAT was able to provide a substantial contribution to the

arrainment of these objectives. Of particular note in this respect has

been coverage provided on known Communist Party members,

especially valuable being that provided on Juan Luis CAMPOS Villalobos.

1. Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Starion Operarions

During the period covered by this project review, LIFEAT. continued

to support the Mexico City Station through its timely pratuction of leads

which were especially useful, and in most cases essential, in assuring

the success of other Station operations.. The following is a list,

necessarily selective, of the use made of leads from, and support of

other projects rendered by Project LIFEAT.

* LIFEAT/LIMERICK: 1) Of special note is the support pro-

vided to the Sration's AEIMPULSE operation. Leads and

information rendered by LIFEAT enabled the responsible

Case Officer to prepare adequately for this recruitment attempt

of an officer of the Soviet Embassy. Following the actual

attempt, LIFEAT/LIMERICK was used as a security device

to protect the Scation assets employed in the operasion.

noted in 1A. (5) above, Project LIMES.A was provided with

continuing support by Project LIFEAT. Notabie a mong the

Information and leads provided were those concerning spectfic

properties which the Soviets were interested in renting and/or

3) LIFEAT has provided a check on double-agent

LITARDY-l, giving verifica: ion of his activities and contacts.

A similar check has also been provided on the activities of

Informant LIPAGAN-1.

LIFEAT/LIVERY: 1) This phase of LIFEAT closely

supported the projected LITACIT physical peneration operation

almed at the LIVERY establishment in Mexico City. LIFEAT

provided essential informarion on the rosiers of night duty

officers as well as background information on the target.

2) LIFEAT/LIVERY provided support for the inscallasion of

rechnical surveillance againsi LITACH. Withou the informarion

raided by best T, this are won hild have eire

impossible.

LIPEAT/LITMUS: 1) LIFEAT provided information which

lead to the successful recrultment of agent BEYAN who was

in a position to provide information on BESOOT. 2) LITMUS

leads also lead to the attempted, but unsuccessful, recruit-

ment of one

J, belleved to have been a contact of

Polish officials in Mexico.

3) LIFEAT leads also lead to the

survelllance of a clandestine meeting of Alexander BEKIER,

Polish Counselor uf Legation in Mexico. Due to the advance

notice of the meeting given by LIFEAT, MKCHARITY was

given time to plan technical coverage of the meeting and

prepare especially fabricated equipment for this coverage.

4) LIFEAT was also responsible for the discovery of the

location of a Polish Intelligence basehouse.

This information

was operationally important to the responsible Case Officer.

LIFEAT/LIERODE: In this phase of the LIFEAT project

leads have been most rewarding in terns of agents actually...

recruited and operations supported by LIFEAT provided

information. ]:) LIERODE produced leads which were

directly responsible for the recruiunent of agenis LITANGO1 "

and LITAMIL-3, while providing security check and information

which have increased the valuc of agent LITANGO. 2) The

defections of LITAINT-1 and LITAG-1 were greatly aided by

LIFEAT leads and information.

The internal reaction to

the defections in the target establishment were also readily

available through LIFEAT. 3) At present LIERODE Is

providing coverage, both from a security and informational

standpoint, of the attempt to place a recruited agent as

Mexico-based advisor to a high official of the Cuban Intelli-

gence. This operation is largely dependent upon LIFEAT

leads and support for security coverage of the agent's

activities.

4) LIFEAT/LIERODE has been unusually

successful in providing information which has enabled the

Station to identify nearly all the Cuban agents operating in

Mexico,

Due to the increasing importance of the Cuban target,

tnese revelations are 0 utmost importance.

Coverage of a Cl/CE natuse was provided by LIFEAT targeted

against a recruited member of the Mexican Communis: Party,

and has produced leads on semi-clandestine travel of party

members behind the Iron Curtain, as well as providing a check

on the veracity of the agent.

Project LIFEAT has been employed also in supwant a ar

highly sensitive LIEMIT operation.

J. Conclusion

¿ It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided

so other Station operations, the CE informa: lon obtained, and the positive

intelligence gathered by Project LIFEAT well justify the expenditure of

KUBARK assets in terms of funds, personnel, time and security risk.

The information produced by this operation has materially concributed to

several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

K. There is a tached herewith a complete list of HMMs produced from

LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1959 through May 1960.

(See attached sheet.)

Progress of the Operation

Since the Project LIFEAT objectives are unique in that they are of

& continuing nature and not designed to he fulfilled within a given period,

no statistics can be cited from which a percentage of coverage on each

objective can be calculated. A general indication can be given of the

coverage provided by the projeci when it is noted that approximately

15, 000 pages of raw texi were provided in the July 1959 to May 1960 perlod.

LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the

number of lines covered varying from 12 to 18. Generally, these can be

broken down as follows:

Soviet Embassy

5 lines

Polish Legation and Polish

Counselor

Czech Legation (Embassy)

2 lines (Coverage suspended

January '60 for reason

given in I. B above)

American Communists

2 lines

Cuban Emcassy

3 lines

Targets of Opportunity

3 lines

Planning for the Furure

Following the suggestion and guidance provided by Headquarters when

renewing Project LIFEAT for FY 1950, the Station plans to limit its

coverage to no more than twenty lines at any given time, with the possible

exception of targets of opportunity which could be covered for short periods

in addicton to the normal coverage.

The coverage of Sovlet and Satellite

installations wili remain basic to LIFEAT and will be exploited to the

maximum degree possible. Due to the increased importance of Information

on Cuban acrivitles, coverage of the Cuban Embussy and personnel staffing

the Embassy will be increased during the coming project year. Targets of

Opportunity will' continue to be explolted as permitted by personnel,

equipment, and access limitations.

Performance of Agents

The general overall performance of the agents employed under LIFEAT

continued to be good with security being stressed in all phases of the

operation. No security problems were encountered which were not readily

solved by the personnel concerned. Since a high degree of security la

required for the operation of LIFEAT, it, Is planned that any possible

agent candidates will be thoroughly screened and Headquarters clearance

obtained before they are in any way approached for operational use.

Expenditures During the Period Under Revlew

Approval for the renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted on 16 July

1959, for the period 1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960, In the amount of

$123,830. In ito continuing momp to provido practicat eomany wkhous

12.

The cover of personnel employed in Project LIFEAT remains the

same as noted in the last project renewal.

Contact and Communicattons

a. Daily contaci is maintained between the Case Officers and the

agents in this project.

These contacts are made in a clandestine manner

with varing atterns established ior car pickups, foor contacts, and

emergency meetings. Pre-arranged signals are employed in setting and

accomplishing the meetings. When heary or bulky material is to be passed,

meetings are held at night. All movement in and out of the basehouses by

the Case Officers and Principle Agents is done in cars ostensibly owned by

gents, except in the case of LIVERY basehouse where the agents are to

Id to drive. One of the indigenous igents is used to contact LIVERY bas

made only in grea: emergencies.

b. Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents

• Is kept to a minimum. Pre-arranged open cile is used for phone

conversasions between Case Officers and agents.

c. Alternare and emergency signals have been arranged and are

revlewed frequently by the personnel using them.

d. These systems of contact and communication appear suitable

for the project and function adequately from a security viewpolnt.

Locations and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are

changed frequently to decrease the possibility of discovery.

Control and MotivatIon

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors:

Ideulogy and financlal gain.

A secondary factor is the fear of reprisal

from the local police should discovery aceur.

Training.

Initial tratning of new personnel and refresher training for

experienced agents is handled primarily by the outaide case officer, David

Mi. WILSTED. Minor repatr and maintainance of equipment as well as

emergency security procedures are stressed and continually revlewed

with the agents.

Equipment and Support.

It la believed that much of the technical equipment upon which the

continued successíul collection of LIFEAT material depends will require

When present Imited commercial stocks of replacement parts are

exhausted, new units will be required for LIFEAT.

Timetable

LIFEAT has been in almosi constani operatien since its Incepiion

in January 195l and it Is planned to continue it Indefinitely.
