1. Station fully agrees with Headquarters concerning the value of
concentrating LIFEAT or LIENVOY coverage on suspected and/or known
Soviet, Satellite and Cuban agents residing in Mexico City, The Station
in the past has undertaken this type coverage and will continue such
coverage in the future as LIFEAT and LIENVOY facilities become avail=
able for assignment to these targets. As Headquarters is aware, thie Station
can and will cover any possible target Headquarters considers of high
enough priority to cover.

2. For éxample, Carmen BRUFAU Civit was covered for 1950, 1957,
1960 and 1901; the results were not considered of sufficient value to continue

the coverage.

PROJECT REVIEW

i. Product of the Project

A. Soviet Coverage

As noted In last year's Project LIFEAT renewal request, LIFEAT coverage
of the offictal Sovict Lastallation was discontinued on 22 June 1960 when the
parallel Italson project LIENVOY assumed coverage of this target, In early
January 1962 LIFEAT undertook coverage of the home phones of three of the
most active Soviet Intelligence officers, This was In response to the con-
tinuing Station Cl program which includes the monitoring of Sov tet contacts,
and the guidance recetved from KUDESK Staff at the time of the last LIFEAT
renewal, Ag of this date, thls coverage bas not been active for sufficlent
ume to fully evaluate its usefulness, However, It is belleved that such
coverage has the potential to add matertally cw the Station's effort tn the Cl
field, Although not designed to provide positive Intelligence, some by-product
of this type has been obtained, Samples are as follows:

HMM-6364, 8 May 1962 (Briefing of Mexican Pro-Marxist Journalist
by Soviet Embassy)

HMM-6382, 15 May 1962 (Mexican Traveller to the USSR)

HMM-6376, 11 May 1962(Refutation of Rumors that Saviet Cosmonaut

TITOV will visit Mexico)

B, Pollsh Embassy

LIFEAT has remained the primary source of information on this target and the
only successful,. continuing penetration of the target, The information provided
to the Interested Case Offtcer has in the past been described as “unique” and
“Invaluable”, ‘This description holds with equal emphasis for the present as
well as the past, Selective examples of the valuable positive intelligence pro-

duct of this coverage are:

C, Cuban Coverage

LIFEAT was able to provide coverage of major firms dealing in. US. goods
transshipment via Mexico to Cuba, This technical operation not only pro-
vided initlal leads which alerted the Statlon to these companies, but also
was able to provide continuing Information on the daily activities of the com-
panies Involved, Coverage of certain Cuban personages arranging for Ulegal
transshipment of U.S. goods to Cuba was also provided including their con-
tacts and general activities, Samples of the posttive intelligence aaa
from thls Cuban commercial coverage are as. follows: :

HMMA-18073, 31 October 1961 (Ruben SAUREZ Y Alvarez,

D, ‘American Communists in Mexico

‘As in the past, most of the targets in this group have been covered at the
‘request of ODENVY, and the raw-take has been partially processed by them,
During the period Juty 1961 through May 1962, approximately 680 reels of
take were passed <o local ODENVY for thelr processing. The most valuable
information gleaned from the targets in this fleld continues to deal with con-
tacts, travel, and general activities of the American Communist Group tn

Mexico (ACGM),

E, Exile and Revolutionary Activities

LIFEAT continues to provide information on the exile and revolutionary groups
active in Mexico, which information is of the greatest value to the Statlon and
not avallable from other sources, The emphasis of the LIFEAT effort in this
area has been directed toward covérage of Nicaraguan, Guatemalan, and more

recently Spanish Republican exiles,

The product has been most rewarding in this

coverage, Examples of productivity in this past project year:

G. Operational Support and Leads Provided other Station Operations

During the past project year LIFEAT continued actively supporting Mexico City
Station through production of leads unobtainable through other assets and gen-
erally providing other Station operations the secure support only available
through a unilateral telephone tap operation, Th2 following Is a selected List,
together with a brief description, of major contributions of operational support
and leads provided through LIFEAT:

=e”



LIFEAT/Cuban: The mos: noteworthy LIFEAT. contribution to Station efforts
tn the Cuban operations field was that of providing leads pinpointing the acti-
vities of Transcontinental, S.A, in the illegal transshipment of U.S. materials
to Cuba via Mexicv, LIFEAT was able to continue coverage of the activities
of this company despite the efforts of the company to lose itself in the Mexican
business community by changing the name ‘It operated under to Inversiones
Mexicanas, ‘S.A. and changing its location and telephone number, Valuable
information on the commercial commodities needed by the Castro regime,
methods and contacts used in their procurement, and ‘information on the con-”
tacts of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico were obtained,

LIFEAT/Czechoslovakian: LIFEAT coverage of the home phones of two Czech
intelligence officers provided some leads to their contacts, but more impor-
tantly, provided greater security to KUBAR K when oité of their CIS officers,
Miloslav CECH, was sirigled out for a defection attempt, . Through LIFEAT
“Livemontitoring” cf both the original and followup defection attempts, the
KUBARK assets were provided maximum proteciion from possible attempts

by CECH to alert his coworkers or arrange entrapmeuat of the KUBARK per-
sonnel Involved,

LIFEAT/Polish: Probably the mos: "classic" example of the use of a telephone
tap in providing a teid which could develop into a vital penetration of the Polish
intelligence occurred recently in the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation. LIFEAT
provided the initial leads ‘which made the Station aware of the possibilities of an
operation and has continued to provide vital information for Station's develop-

ment of the operation, It is the Station's opinion that this one instance of service

by LIFEAT was well worth the cost of the entire project for the year, (Full
information forwarded in MEX1 0462 and MEXI 0463). Also of great interest
to the Station were the LIFEAT provided leads which revealed Jan SLUSARZ,
Attache of the Polish Embassy in Mexico, had purchased an automobile which
had been stolen in the U.S, and driven to Mexico, In this operation, in which
a defection attempt was cousid2red, LIFEAT provided aot only the initial leads,
but also daily operational information vital to the S:ation's efforts in this case.

LIFEAT/ Yugoslavian: In this | coverage of the Yugoslavian Embassy LIFEAT is
providing the basic data necessary in establishing operations against this target,
Since the Station is expanding its coverage of Yugoslavian activities, much vital
data on personalities, contacis, and services obtained by the target establish-
ment must be provided, It is this exact type of coverage that LIFEAT is geared
to provide in addition to the operational leads which will be forthcoming as this
coverage progresses. The interesced case officer, noting LIFEAT is his only
present source of information, feels the take which LIFEAT provides and will

>

rae


continue to, provide in this area is vital and basic to the mounting of any
operations ‘against the Yugoslav target. :

LIFEAT/Soviet/Double Agent: LIFEAT support has provided needed sup-
porting information in backing Station double agent operations, In this area
the success of the operation is obviously dependent upon the veracity of the
agent, CIFEAT provides information which enables the interested case ~,
officer to determine the veracity of the agent Involved. LIFEAT also Provides
a needed check upon the act witles of the double agent,

LIFEAT/Spanish Republican: ‘LIPEAT coverage of Spanish Republican exiles

in Mexico City have enabled the Station to monitor the activities of the various
groupings of the exiles, including the projected attempt on the life of the

senior ODACID official In Mexico, LIFEAT has covered personalities of exile
factions both involves in planning this attempt and those opposed to it. Coverage
of targets in this area also enables che Station to keep abreast of the plans and
activities ofthe various groups which make up the Spanish Republican exile
community in Mexico City.

LLFEAT/CI-CE Coverage: LIFEAT leads In this area are exploited in the:re-
porting of travel of important Communists, particularly to Cuba and tron **
Curtain countries, and the travel of U.S, citizens, especially Communists and
Leftists, co Cuba, Through coverage of the American Communist Group in
Mexico (ACGM) LIFEAT has provided ODENVY with an increasing amount of
information on the leftist activities of relatives and friends of the ACGM who
reside in the U.S. One of the noteable items in this regard Is providing data

on the overt and covert efforts of the blacklisted “Hollywood Ten" to regain thetr
former stetus in the U.S. film industry.

Finally, and certainly not of least importance, Station security has beenenhanced
through LIFEAT periodic coverage cf-former Station assets, like LIVESTOCK-1
and LIVESTOCK-2, who could be a danger to particular Station operations or
personnel, Monitoring of certain terminated agents is considered especially
valuable where these agents were involved in the more sensitive operations,

Conclusion

It is the opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided other Station
operations, the CI/CE information and leads, and the ability of the unilateral
LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targets without revealing Station interest



has beén jidted in the past, that even with the Station's
el; but liaison, LIENVOY operation, a change in
ent ical government administration or a change-in govern-
ment adminiscrations.could end KUBARK participation in that liaison project,
For that reason, 1 IREAT, in addition to maintaining Its present-heavy coverage, . E
must be‘available‘to once again undertake coverage of the official Soviet and :
Czech officlal targets in Mexico City, Therefore, LIFEAT's present orientation, 2
though toward supporting Station Operations and CI/CE mission rather than toward
targets which would provide positive intelligence, leaves it readily available for™
recall into the Soviet-Czech coverage. ' It is the Station's firm opinion that the
LIFEAT pr oject provides a’stibstantial and vital contribution in fulfilling the
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive,

“ Thére ts attached a Hst of the HMMs produced from LIFEAT provided material
during the period July 1961 through May 1962 as a by-product of the project’ ‘8
prime responsibility of providing support to Station operations, :

IL Progress of the Operation

The objectives of the LIPEAT Project are of a continuing nature and are there-
fore not considered for fulfillment during any given period of time, For this
reason percentage figures as to compleilon of project objectives cannot be drawn,
However, an lndication of the coverage provided in working toward fulfillment

of the objectives can be noted in that 14,000 pages of raw text were produced

in the period July 1961 through May 1962, LIFEAT has been In daily operation
during the review period with the average aumber of lines covered per month
being 20, with a high in March 1962 of 28 lines covered,

Il, Planning for the Future

As was indicated at the time of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes to re-
main uncommitted to coverages that require the expenditure of 4 great portion

of LIFEAT resources but provide coverage of but one target...such as Soviet
Embassy coverage. It is added emphatically, however, that should the need arise
for LIFEAT to again assume such responsibilities, it is fully able to do so,

Uatil' such time LIFEAT will continue to enjoy greater flexibility in the employ-
ment of its assets, especially ia the areas in which the Station does not wish to
reveal its interest or operations to the-liaison: forces involved in the LIENVOY

operation,

As to particular areas of operations, the Station has hopes of employing
LIFEAT assets in “hot mike operations which require access to telephone

— 7


centrals and cables, The feasibility of using LIFEAT in thls type of operation
has already been proven, tna recent operation with the LIERODE installation
aa a target, Seven reels of "hot mike" take were obtalied In test runs on
checking both the operation (including installation of the "miked" instrument

in the:office of the head of the LIERODE official installation) and che equipment
which was of radical design and conceived and bullt by the KURIOT technician
aasigned to Mexico City Station under deep cover, Unfortunately, before con-
tinuous operation could'get underway, the LIERODE installation decided upon
complete renovation of its teleptione system, including the installation ofa
switchboard, This, at least temporarily, precludes further operatton against
this particular target, unless a direct liné Ig installed there, However, it is
the intention of the Station to attempt coverage of other targets of Interest. In
these plans LIFEAT plays the key role tn installation, line and serles.cross _
maintenance, basshouse procurémeit and maintenance, and “processing of take,
From the brief test runs vila the LIERODE operation noted above, it is believed
that "hot mike" operations, supported and maintained by LIFEAT, can greatly ald.
the Station in its coverage of responsibilities under its present Related Mission
Directive,

IV, Performance of Agents

Vv.

Vi

The overall performance of all agents employed in the LIFEAT complex con-
tinued to be good during the perlod of the project review, wich security being
stressed In all phases of the operation, No security problemg were encountered
which were not solved by the personncl involved, Since the success of the
LIFEAT operation depends largely upon the security of its personnel, Head-
quarters clearances and evaluation of ncw personnel will continue to be sought
‘on those new additions who pass a strict ficld assessment,

Expenditures
Approval for renewal of Project LIFEAT was granted 8 September 1961 for FY
1962 in the amount of $98,973.03. The proposed budget for FY 1963 is broken

PROJECT OUTLINE, PARTI

Area of Operations

‘This operation ts run-from Mexico City Station and is concerned with targets
located within Mexico City,

Purpose i z
The purpose of this project Is to provide, unilaterally, daily Information on the
activities of officlal foreign installations in Mexico and the personnel thereof,

ag well as coverage of the activities of sclecied Individuals and groups in response
to both Station necds and Headquarters requests. Presently, LIFEAT stresses
flexibility of coverage with support of Station operatione and CI/CE coverage .
recelving the greatest emphasis, :

Background

Project LIFEAT was ortginated on. 3. October 1950 as a unilateral telephoné'tap
operation, Actual Initiation of operations under this authority occurred on 18

January 1951, and the operation has run continuou..ly from that date, The pro-

Ject was opened with the ins:allation of a single tap and has grown In the past
eleven years to coverage of as. many as thirty Unes ina given month,

The LIFEAT Project {a a unilateral operation completely independent from any
lalgon arrangement. It ts staffed by KUBARK contract employees with the ma«
jority of personnel betng Indigenous controlled agents,

During the past eleven years, Project LIFEAT has prodticed more than 83, 500
(estimate) pages of operational and Intelligence information in direct support of
Mexico City Station's specific objectives, and contributed matertally to the in-
telligence gathering activities connected with the Sovlet-Satellite Bloc and more
recently with the Cuban representatives in Mexico, In addition, LIFEAT has
been of considerable value in monitoring the activities of the American Communist
Group in Mexico (ACGM), a3 well as the activitles of the exile groups and local

Communists,



With the LIENVOY's assumption of coverage of the Soviet and Czechoslovaklan
Official installations in july 1960, LIFEAT assets were released from continuous
coverage:of.these two targets, These assets. were then employed in diréct
support of Station operations--a role: ideally sulted for a untlatcral operation
such a8 LIFEAT, and extremely important to the security and success of

Station operations, LIFEAT, after spending much of Project Year 1961 - 1962
programing to this new role and redirecting its assets, has now adjusted to

this role and ls fully employed in this vital assignment,

8. Coordination

a, Information produced by LIFEAT, primarily a Station operational sup-
port asset, ts closely coordinated with other operations of the Mexico City
Station, No operational coordination is required with any other geographical

- area,” butthey are advised of any information produced by LIFEAT which may

be of interest to them,

b, Project LINOG which supports the principal “outside” Case Officer,
David M, WILSTED, is effected in coordination with Project LIFEAT,

c. Coordination with the parallel, but liaison project - LIENVOY, ts
closely coordinated between the responsible Case Officers of both projects,
particularly relating to the division of coverage between the two operations,
thereby assuring that the unilateral LIFEAT operation will not be endangered
by the indigenous personnel of the LIENVOY operation,

9, Personnel

a, Career and Contract Agents

(1) David M, WILSTED (201-009195), principal "outside" Case Officer,
(2) Wayne C, DRABAND-(201-255095), outside assistant to David

M, WILSTED, DRABAND was introduced into the LIFEAT opera-

tion in November 1961 as a replacement for Ralph B, RAFANELLI

who was transferred from Mexico PCS in the fall of 1961, His OA

was amended 14 November 1961 to cover his use in the LIFEAT
Project, Although DRABAND possessed only limited knowledge of
clandestine activity when first employed, under WILSTED's instruc-
tion and Case Officer guidance, plus his own willingness and capacity
for work, it appears he will prove a valuable addition to the

LIFEAT complex.

June 1962), Plans for use of this couple as haschousekeepers
were cancelled when LIFEUD- 22 and LIFEUD-23, who are more
desirable chotcea, became avatlable for LIFEAT use, Ter-
mination has been discussed fully with these indigenous agents,
‘and :erminatlon arrangements were accomplished on a friendly
and mutually agreeable basis (as in all LIFEAT terminations,
separation [sy made on the basis of Mexican custom and/or law),

12, Contact and Communications

Daily contact Is maintained between the Case Officer and the agents employed tn
the project, These contacts are made in a clandeetine manner with varying
patterns established for car pickups, foot contucta, and cmergency meetings,
Pre-arranged signals are employed (n setting and accomplishing the meetings,
When heavy or bulky matertal Is to be passed, mectings are held at night, En-"
trance to the basehouses by other than the basechousekeepers is made only on the
basis of strict necessity; such as need for equipment repatr, installation for
new line coverages, or Hne coverage cut off,

Telephone contact concerning the project and with the agents ls kept to a min-
imum, Pre-arranged open code fs used for phone conversations between Case
Officers and agents, Alternate and emergency communications have becn arranged
and are reviewed frequently by the personnel using them,

These systems of contact and communication appear suitable for the project
and function adequately from the security and utility standpoints, Locations and
times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are changed frequently to decrease
the possibility of arousing the suspictons of the residents of areas in which meet-

ings are held,

Control and Motivation

Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors: ideology and
financial gain, A secondary factor ls the fear of reprisal from the local
police should discovery occur,

Security ‘i e

During the past project year there were no Incidents which were beyond the
capability of the personnel Iminediately involved to isolate and remedy im-
mediately, In contrast to previous years, there was no instance of telephone
work crews approaching a basehouse to check or reinove the tap lines running
to that baschouse, Some of the "crosses" made in the telephone centrals
have been removed by the central's workmen, but these are of no danger to
the operation unlega a -full Investigation is made of one of these unusual con-
nections, During the past project years no such Investigation has been under-
taken, and no suspicion of the LIFEAT iinemea haa been revealed to date,

As for the past few yearg the telephone company Is continuing its efforts toward
modernization of the Mexico City telephone system, This cffort includes
changing from overhead lincs :o underground cables, cleaning off of the

amused overhead “dead lines" and Installation of new equipment throughout

the city, These innovations will continue to cause security prablems for the
LIFEAT complex, but it is belleved that these problems are rot insurmountable,
To meet this challange to LIFEAT security and to prepare for the day when
access to telephone distribution lines ts further reduced by their placement

in underground cables, LIFEAT has recently succeeded in having one of its
Mnemen (LIFEUD- 2) selected to attend a four month special course In cable
work, When he completes this course (in July 1962), LIFEUD-2 will have
working access to all cableways and cable termination boards in Mexico City,
This access will be invaluable from both the present security and operational
standpoints as well as for the future whea LIFEAT will be forced to tap directly
from the underground telephone cables, As a standard procedure the LIFEAT
personnel continuously work to devise new methods to increase security, ag
well as train in security procedures, so as to continue the high level of security
enjoyed by LIFEAT in the past.

Training
Initial cratning of new personnel and continuing refresher training for the ex-

perienced personnel are handled primarily by the “outside” case officer, David
M, WILSTED, Minor repair aud maintenance of equipment as well as emergency

security procedures are stressed and ee reviewed with the agents.

" Equipment and Support

As noted in last year's renewal request, LIFEAT equipment ta generally old
and much of it is now obsolete, With funds provided In last year's renewal,
LIPEAT (within the past month) has begun to acquire some new equipment,
particularly audio recorders, A review of the cquipment situation in the
LIFEAT sctup Kas convinced both WILSTED and the responsible Case Officer
that a near-complete-modernization.program of the equipment used tn
LIFEAT must be uridertakea during the coming project year, The local.
KURIOT technician has on a number of ocagsions expressed his amazement
atthe supertor product produced by LIFEAT with the outmoded and anctent
equipment (in terms of use hours) which the LIFEAT complex had to rely on,
Therefore, with the funds requested in Part Il of thls renewal request,

- LIFEAT should be Gompletély equipped’ with adequate gear, particularly audio

and dial tape recorders, by the expiration of FY 1963, Admittedly, there is.
Involved large, one-tlme expenses in Complete replacement of such expensive ©
items during a single project year, However, It is a necessary move, due ~
entirely to great wear borae by the equipment, This wear {s now causing such
a rash of breakdowns that the outside principal agent must spend a dlspropor-
tlonate amount of his Ume in maintenance work,

Timetable

a) BUTURE/OPS said that the Staticn is to be comnended on ‘its hand-
Ling of the requested Bloo coverage by LIENVOY while maintaining LIFEAT
capability and limiting coverage to those lines mst profitable. KUTVBE
noted tho insreasod emphasis on exploitation of operational information,
In order to continue this aspect of the operation, the Station is faced
with the difficult problem of selectivity in targeting and processing
take from these tvo large projects. Every effort should be mda
to increase the efficiency of processing to maintain LIFEAT at its present
high level. In KUTUEE/OPS's opinion, LIFEAT parsonnel and espability must
bo carefully maintained in face of.the easier but less secure LIENVOT.

b) KUDESK stated that thie unilateral asset should be continued de-
spite the fact that we are runing 4 ainiler operation with the local gov.
ernment, : It 1a hoped that the Station 1111 soan be able to use this asset
in tho investigation of individuals known to be in clandestine contact

Ab a mosting with the Chief af stetian on 25 June 1960, LITzis h asked the

Je The Station does not enticipste any probism connected with tho -

I, Operational Leads and Support Provided Other Starioa Operations

During the period covered by this project review, LIFEAT.continued
to support the Mexico City Station through its timely production of leads
which were especially useful, and in most cases essential, in assuring
the success of other Station operations, . The following is a list,
necessarily selective, of the use made of leads from, and support of
other projects rendered by Project LIFEAT,

“> -EIFEAT/LIMERICK?: 1) Of special note is the support pro-
vided to the Station's AELMPULSE operation, Leads and a
information rendered by LIFEAT enabled the responsible
Case Officer to prepare adequately for this recruitment attempt
of an officer of the Soviet Embassy, Following the actual
attempt, LIFEAT/LIMERICK was used as a security device
to protect the Scation assets employed in the operation. 2) As
noted in LA. (5) above, Project LIMESA was provided with
continuing support by Project LIFEAT, Notable amoag the
information and leads provided were those concerning specific
properties which the Soviets were interested in renting and/or
buying, 3) LIFEAT has provided a check on doudle-agent
LITARDY-I, giving verification of his activities and contacts,

A similar check has also been provided on the activities of
informant LIPAGAN-L,

LIFEAT/LIVERY: 1) This phase of LIFEAT closely

supported the projected LITACIT physical penetration operation
aimed at the LIVERY establishment in Mexico City, LIFEAT
provided essential information on the rosters of night duty
officers as well as background information on the target,

2) LIFEAT/LIVERY provided support for the installation of
technical surveillance against LITACH, Withou the information
provided by LIFEAT, this operation would have been extremely
hazardous at best, and probably would have been entirely

impossible. SERRET /k iv a Ae
babal .



LUFEAT/LITMUS. Al). LIFEAT provided information which,

lead to the successful: récrultment of agent BEYAN who:was:
. ina position.to provide information on ‘BESOOT, 2) LITMUS -
tase fpieteteeea leadsalso-lead to the attempted, but unsuccessful, recruir-

7 +. > ment of one , believed to have been a-contact of
Polish officials in Mexico, 3) LIFEAT leads also lead to the
surveillance of a clandestine meeting of Alexander BEKIER,
Polish Counsclor of Legation in Mexico, Due to the advance
notice of the meeting given by LIFEAT, MKCHARITY was.
given time to plan technical coverage of the mecting and
prepare especially fabricated equipment for this coverage,

4) LIFEAT was also responsible for the discovery of the .
location of a Polish Intelligence basehoyse, This information
was operationally important to the responsible Case Officer,

LIFEAT/LIERODE: In this phase of the LIFEAT project

leads have been most rewarding in terms of agents actually, on.
recruited and operations supported by LIFEAT provided :
information, -1) LIERODE produced leads which were

directly responsible for the recruitment of agents LITANGO-1
and LITAMIL-3, while providing security check and information
which have increased the value of agent LITANGO, 2) The
defections of LITAINT-1 aad LITAG-1 were greatly aided by
LIFEAT leads and information, The internal reaction to

the defections in the target establishment were also readily
available through LIFEAT, 3) At present LIERODE ts
providing. coverage, both from a security and informational
standpoint, of the attempt to place a recruited agent as
Mexico-based advisor to a high official of the Cuban Intelli-
gence, This operation is largely dependent upon LIFEAT

leads and support for security coverage of the agent's
activities, 4) LIFEAT/LIERODE has been unusually
successful in providing information which has enabled the
Station to identify nearly all the Cuban agents operating tn
Mexico, Due to the increasing importance of the Cuban target,
these revelations are of utmost importance,

Coverage of a CI/CE nature was provided by LIFEAT targeted’
against a recruited member of the Mexican Commuaist Party,
aad has produced leads on semi{-clandestine travel of party
members behind the Iron Curtain, a3 well as providing a check
on the veracity of the agent.

~ J. \Conclusion *

It isthe Opinion of the Mexico City Station that the support provided
to other Station operations, the CE information obtained, aad the positive
intetligence gathered by Project LIFEAT well justify the expenditure of
KUBARK assets in terms of funds, personnel, time aad security risk.
The information produced by this operation has materiaily corrributed to
several priority objectives of the Station's Related Mission Directive, .

K. There is attached herewith a complete list of HMMs produced from
LIFEAT provided material during the period July 1959 through May 1960.
(See attached sheet.)

Progress of the Operation

Since the Project LIFEAT objectives are untque in that they are.of
@ continuing nature and not designed to be fulfilled within a given period,
no statistics ca2 be cited from which a percentage of coverage on each
objective can be calculated. A generat indication can be given of the
coverage provided by the project when it is noted that approximately
15, 000 pages of raw text were provided in the July 1959 to May 1960 period,
LIFEAT has been in daily operation during the review period with the
number of lines covered varying from 12 to 18. Generally, these can be
broken down as follows:

Soviet Embassy 5S lines
Polish Legation and Polish
Counseler 3 lines

Czech Legation (Embassy) 2 lines (Coverage suspended
January '60 for reason
given in I, B above)

Americaa Communists 2 lines

Cubaa Embassy 3 lines

Targets of Opportunity 3 tines:

Planning for the Future

Following the suggestion and guidance provided by Headquarters when
renewing Project LIFEAT for FY 1990, the Station plans to limit its
coverage to no more than twenty lines at aay given time, with the possible
exception of targets of opportunity which could be covered for short periods

Performance of Agents

‘The general overall performance of the agents employed under LIFEAT
continued to be good with security being stressed in all phases of the
operation, No security problems were encountered which were not readily
solved by the persomel concerned, Since-a high degree of sécurity is
fequired for the operation of LIFEAT, tt. is planned that any possible Beet
agent candidates will be thoroughly screened aad Headquarters clearance fai
obtained before they are in any way approached for operational use, oH

Contact and Communicattons

a, Daily contact is maintained between the Case Officers aad the
agents in this project. These contacts are made: in a clandzstine manner
with varing patterns established tor car pickups, foot contacts, and
emergency meetings. Pre-arranged signals are cmp!oyed in setting and
accomplishing the meetings. When heavy or bulky material is to be passed,
meetings are held at night, All movement in and out of the basehouses by
the Case Officers and Principle Agents is done in cars ostensibly owned by
agents, except in the case of LIVERY basehouse where the agents are too
old to drive, One of the ind:genous agents is used to contact LIVERY base,

made only in great eméryencies,

. b.* Telephone contact conc érning the project and with the agents
ts ‘kept toa minimum, Pre-arranged open code is used for phone
conversations between Case Officers and agents,

ec, Alternate and emergency signals have been arranged and are
reviewed frequently by the personnel using them,

d, These systems of contact and communication appear suitable
for the project and function adequately from a security viewpoint,
Locations and times of meetings are reviewed periodically and are
chaaged frequently to decrease the possibility of discovery.

Control and Motivation
Control and motivation are primarily based on two factors:

ideology and financial gain, A secondary factor Is the fear of reprisal
from the local police should discovery occur,

Tratning
Initial training of new personel aad refresher training for

expertenced agents is handled primarily by the outside case officer, David

M, WILSTED, Minor repair and mainralnaace of equipment as well as
emergency security procedures are stressed and continually reviewed
with the agents,

Equipment and Support,

It la believed that much of the technical equipment upon which the
continued successful collection of LIFEAT material depends will require
replacement in the near future, The targest percentage of this equipment
has been In nearly continuous operation from the initiation of the project

in January 1935! and much of this equipmenr ts no longer being manufactured,

When present Itmited commercial stecks of replacement parts are
exhausted, new, units will be required for LIFEAT,

Le The LIFEAT Project renewal subnitted in 20/A-12936 was approved on
6 July 1959 for the period 1 July 1959 through 30 June 1960 for a total of
$123,830 for {sea} year 1960.: The Station will-note that monies requested
for the support of oodrow D. GABBOTT (pa) were subtracted from the request
nade by the Station for pfoject funds, JAB OT! is sup-orted by the 3€SHOOTH
Projeat, an EB suoport project.

2. The following staff comments were nade when the ruject was submitted
for aporoval:

a. "ROM has continued its rating of "C* on the disseninated positive
information fron the Zroject, noting a slight increase in the dieseninations,
‘and comenting that it provides interesting information to customers on the
nature and extent of Bloc comercial activities in Xaxica, data useful in
economic anaiyscs, aud reports on exile activities in Haxico.

produced by the operation haye been of operational value to LAURICLE
activitics conducted in Mexico Uity in the rast year. KUTUBE/D comments

also that the Project has afforded ard can be expected to continue to afford
C$ rrotection from time to time for activities of particular LAURICL! interest.

ce. "KYTUDE/OPS has observed that Project LIF"AT has been a most useful
operational asset in the lexico City Station for the rast nine years,
gontinuously providing KUSARC with a window into inportant targets. KUTU3E/0P3
requests that the next project renewal voint out what agent recruitmonts by
the Station Fave resulted from or been supported by the operational information|
secured by the project. z

4. "KUDESK comented tat it well known that Mexico is being used by
the RIS as a base for third country operations directed against the United
States. Over a oeriod of years LIFUAT has supplied valuable leads which
have resulted in the identification of a larze number of persons in clandestino|
contact with RIS officers; further investigation in several cases produced
information which strongly indicated that the persons involved were
actively assisting the RIS, ~hile suck information te, of itself, of. interest
and importance, cur respcnsibil:ty in the CI field imposes the obligation to
determine wit those persons are doing for the RIS and this can be done only
by recruiting, and-doubling thes, it is'therefore sugested that LIFFAT leads
and reports of investigations based on tiem be revicwed for the purpose of
selecting a limited number of the nore proaising targets. iiereafter, Station
arsets including LIFAT should be used to obtain the overaticnal data
necessary to determine that a tarzet is recruitable, and then a pitch should
be mada. Much tise and effort will be required for such a program, but the
potential rewards fully justify it, and the value of LIFVAT, as a CI asset,
will be materially increased. :

3, Chief, KUTUSR, in recosmending the Project for reneval to Deputy
KUBARK, requested: that-at-the- tina “of the next Project’ renewal; the’ Divis:
raview the relationshin and coordination of Project LISVAT operations with those
active and proposed under Project LIENVOL.

that it will encotintes: difficulty in obtaining aporoval of aveintlar Project ae

‘Vgatiataction of Headquarters that tre. expense involved in th LIFEAT. Project is

thé“ FPO cal ; action of infonistion, the overations] intent is

_ to make nse of this inforsation for ah eventual recruitnert of Sino~Soviet
and; Satellite ‘disfonats ‘and/or their contacts, It 1s realised that diplonats
who are sascettible to defection cr reéritmant in place are few and far
betwsen and that the Station is alvays alert for such targets and is
consciantious in their develoment. liowever, the Case Officer should keep
in mind the more easily accassidle and wore vulnerable (though secondar7)
targets, i.e. the many contacts, friends, ornleyeos, etc. whose develooment
could well lead to the rrimry targets. feadquarters feels it is this
secondary category where nore exchasis canbe madé. ~The recruitment in
placa of such individuals coald-be extrenaly. valuable for the entire
CI/CE progran of the Station. :

b. The lack of davelopment and exploitation of leads from LIFEAT
operations has been raised nany tines. In view of the linited reporting
to Headquarters on the exploitation of operational leads, it has been
difficult to state whether the leeds are being fol:owed up, who the
targets aro, and whether consideration is being given to recruitaent
acsroaches. Headquarters requests that in each nonthly sumary..the
Station supaly more info under the secticu labeled "Exoloitation of
Leads", The statament "leads resvlting fron LirfAT information are
followed up by other Station assets" is meaningless without some
explanatinn of the lead follow ups. ileaduarters would like to know
‘the names and some operational information concerning the persons who
geen to be of most interest ard sto have been under icvestigation during
the period covered by the: monthly. summary. :

5S. On page 6 of your covering menorandua on the FPO (1%#A-12936), you indicat
that during the coming year the Station emects to expand its coverage to
approximataly 2ij lines. Headquarters would like to suggest that consideration
be given to limiting coverage to a number of lines wich can be effectively

exploited.

& It is requested that Headquarters be informed in more detail in all cases
where inforsation obtained through LIFSAT has been used to support other important

Station oparations.

‘statistics cited above were derived. Except, for a period in July and
Avgust 1958, following the ternination of members of the Japs 0. AYCALL
