THIS IS VERY IMPORTANI AND NOT A BAD JOKE!

25/11-63.

The President of the United States of America, John I Kennedy was

assassinated by Lee H Oswald by direct order of the government of

the

Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act alone

but there was helpers and reserv. "Now all is over" was password

to his customers. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but he

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.

Later he was spy for us. When Lee A Oswald had returned to USA we

contacted

nim anew and Ireshened up his minu "you have been a spy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Now we had him. He got his last information in Mexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Kennedy in Mexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as

ssassinated. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion was behind the assassin

ation. When Cuba was attacked by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend

himself. It that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-

ted. We should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for A-

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. We and Sowiet should

win this war and whole the world should be Communistic. Then we should

assassinate Krustjev and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader

of the NEW WORD. When this letter will reach you they have maked

away with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled

from our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is anchinese spy-shool.

my name is lyo liang luan. Ofticer in the department.

for state-secret.

If you do not belive this letter explain our hate to USA.
