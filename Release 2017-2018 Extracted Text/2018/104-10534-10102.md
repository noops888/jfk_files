normally used by that Embassy.

THIS "IS VIRY IMPORTANT AND NOT A BAD JOKE!
25/11-63.

The President of the United States of America, John F Kennedy was
assassinated by Lee H Oswald by direct order of the government of
the Peoples Republic of China. Lee H Oswald executed the act alone
but there was helpers and reserv. "Now all is over" was password
to his customers. Oswald was a fully convinced Communist but he

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.
Later he was spy for us. When Lee H Oswald had returned fo USA we
contacted niw anew and freshened up his mind “you have been a spy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Now we had him. He got his last information in Mexico. /It was not

good to assassinate Kennedy in liexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as-
ssassinated. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion was behind the assassine
ation. When Cuba was attacked by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend
himself. It that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-
ted. We should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for A-
bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. We and Sowiet should
win this war and whole the world should be Commnistic. Then we should
assassinate Krustjev and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader
of the NEW WORD. When this letter will reach you they have maked

away with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled
from our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is angMinese spy-shool.
My name is Ryo Liang Yuen. Officer in the department. for State-secret.
