AGENCY FILE

NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 6

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 3

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

MEMORANDUM

TO:

Tom Lambeth, Acting Director

FROM:

Steve Fallis, Deputy Chief Counsel

DATE:

June 15, 1977

RE :

Employment of Elizabeth Palmer

I have interviewed Elizabeth Palmer for a position

as document clerk.

Her responsibility will be to supervise

the other document clerks in the maintenance of research

records. She appears to be conscientious, organized and

efficient and I agree with the Research people that some

one of her ability and maturity is necessary lo fulfill

that function.

However, she will have to be paid a salary of $18,000.

Therefore, there must be some adjustments made in the

budget and lines

in order to accommodate her.

I recommend

that she be hired. However, it is essential

that the neces

sary adjustments be made immediately because it may be

necessary to eliminate or doungrade a research position for

which applicants are currently under consideration.
