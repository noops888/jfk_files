A. BACKGROUND

1. Origin and Development

The Pennsylvania State Police furnished the Pittsburgh FBI

Office a copy of a report dated October 14, 1942, which was

written by Detective JOHN CHRIN, Pennsylvania State Police (PSP),

entitled "Mafia Society's Activities in Labor," in which

Detective CHRIN referred to several prominent

Western

Pennsylvania racketeers as members of the Black Hand or of

he darta: that"

No evidence is contained in CHRIN's report to

the effect that these racketeers are actually Mafia members,

but merely refers to then as such.

CHRIN, in his report, also mentioned the society known as the

Rosa, benelicial association organized by JaCk &ANCELLIERE,

a North side, Pittsburgh, racketeer, and composed of a group of

Italian

toughs who carried out collection duties. He said

that most of these toughs carried no guns or knives, but were

armed constantly with a twelve inch to filteen inch cue stick

which they sawed off and weighted with lead.

He said that a

hole bored in the end of the sawed off cue stick was filled

with

the lead and was then corked. He advised that he carried one

himself for many years and would still have it if he had not

left it in the glove compartment of an automobile he sold. He

said that this cue stick was given to him by MikE Noves,"
