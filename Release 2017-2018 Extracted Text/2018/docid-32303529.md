A. BACKGROUND

1. Origin and Development

The Pennsylvania State Police furnished the Pittsburgh FBI
Office a copy of a report dated October 14, 1942, which was
written by Detective JOHN CHRIN, Pennsylvania State Police (PSP),
entitled "Mafia Society's Activities in Labor," in which
Detective CHRIN referred to several prominent Western
Pennsylvania racketeers as members of the Black Hand or of
the Mafia. No evidence is contained in CHRIN's report to
the effect that these racketeers are actually Mafia members,
but merely refers to them as such.

CHRIN, in his report, also ‘qientioned the society kn as the
Villa Rosa, beneficial association organized by JACK}@ANCELLIERE ,
a North Side, Pittsburgh; racketeer, and composed of''a group. of

of this office from other sources to the effect that theyae

Rosa ety might be a Black Hand group.

In Detective CHRIN's report, he indicates that in.1942, there
were at least two hundred members of the Black Hand in

Italian toughs who carried. out collection duties. “He said
that most of these toughs. carried no guns or knives, but were
armed constantly with a twelve inch to fifteen inch cue stick
which they sawed off and weighted with lead. He said that a
hole bored in the end of the sawed off cue stick was filled with
the lead and was then corked. He advised that he carried one
himself for many years and would still have it if he had not
left it in the glove compartment of an automobile he sold. (He
said that this cue stick was given to him by MIKEX ENOVESE ,
its original owner, who told him to use it "for pro ection."
He said that during this period the local hoodlums and toughs
had great respect for the power and temper of LA ROCCA who was
