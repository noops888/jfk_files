In December 1944 Subject was security approved for 058 employment to be
used overseas in a writing/publishing assignment. However, he was
assigned to combat infantry duties in the Southwest Pacific Area and was
not used by OSS. Of interest in his file at this time are memorenda
recording a visit he made to the Honolulu Office of 035 in February 1945
in which he told the office how he had been recruited by OSB while
attending infentry school et Fort Benning in October 194; that his
ys Services were to be used in originating and conducting radio programs in
j . the CBI theater; that when he did not hear from OSS, he made certain

++ Subject had never been in Washington.

i i was not in a position to avail themselves of his services but he was to

keep in touch. Th¢ interviewing officer in Honolulu forwarded a report
“of the visit to the Security Officer at 03S Headquarters with a comment to
note the Dunn and/Bradstreet leak and that Subject certainly knew more '
@bout the inside of OSS than any potential recruit he ever sew and

his dependents were issued travel clearances to join him at th 23
Subject suffered a nervous breakdown in. March 1952 and was returned
warters, Washington for medical observation. Examination by the
Medical Office in April 1952 concluded that Subject's breakdown was caused
by family trouble and overindulgence in alechol. The Medical Office
recomended that he should not attempt any extreme covert work but should
only accept either light semi-covert or overt duties for a probationary
. period of one year, these duties to be performed within the continental
limits of the United States. Subject was assigned to OTR as an instructor
in the Operations Course in May 1952 and recommended for conversion to
staff status after a four-month probationary period. This transfer was
security approved in October 1952 and he received his appointment as a
GS-11 Training Instructor with OTR (Operations Training Branch).

" near Temporary Eye Building bleeding from the mouth. ‘here was no evidence

from the Medical Office and Security went to his residence at the Lefayette |
Hotel where they found Subject under the influence of alcohol. He was i

: a received permission from Subject's doctor, Dr. Albert

agreed to cooperate. Two nurses, anesthetists, a Mra. Sally MOORE
and a Helen GORMAN were briefed end promised to cooperate: Dr. D'ERRICO
asked Agent: if he should introduce him to Subject and the

in the operating room were: “Hes Washington contacted you, ‘or is there
: 4 CIA agent or an FBI agent here in the hospital to be with me uring
a the operation?" Dr. D'ERRICO snewered "no" to this question. Subject

: Agent] | using the pseudo, Dr. SHAUGHNESSY, was in Subject's
room when recovered from the effects of the anesthetic. Bubject's

father was aleo there. (Subject's father, William Clarence WOOD, 6r.

by is a well-to-do banker; the Lubbock National Bank of Lubbock, Texas. )

. Bubject looked around the room and inquired of his fathert “Daddy, has
‘any man besides the medical staff entered this room while you hava been
"here?" The father replied, "No, son, no one hes entered the room except

the doctor here (referring to Dr. SHAUGHNESSY) and the nurse." After

Subject was convinced no government agent was there, he stated he “had

served overseas with the CIA and had seen many people killed. ‘The CIA

ere @ bunch of dirty cut-throats and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if

= they sent one of their men to cut mine. They think they are smart but = - |

| one of these days in tha near future I will show them who is the |
smartest. They have about 100 GS-1l's walking around with their heada

shaped like eggs. Daddy, I have been such a failure but after I get well

: I am going to go back to school and get my degree and fight the CIA with

Bubject neve: re of Dr. SHAUGHNESSY's. identity. Subject's
doctor told Agent| that SubJject's trouble was probably caused
by the excessive use of alechols that 1f he woulda telk under the influence
