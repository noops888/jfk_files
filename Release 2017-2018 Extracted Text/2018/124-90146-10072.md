National Palestine Committee by Aron Raindorf, a Belgian citizen (
born on December 22, 1919, at St. Gilles,

Following a period during which the two groups age ‘
worked in. harmony, a schism took place in November, 1871, which |
resulted in a new group being formed by Dupire and Yvonne Sterck
which was called The Responsible Group for the National i
Palestinian Committee and the Palestinian Committee-Brusseis CA

‘The "New York Times" on 3/24/61, in an article entitled
"US Asks Court Bar Questions On Castro Foes in Miami Area", by Peter
Kihss, reported that an unidentifiied US agency had intervened in a
murder trial in Miami asking: that questions about activities by Cubans
in that area seeking the overthrow of Premier Fidel Castro of Cuba be
barred in the trial. The article stated that the above intervention
became known while the FPCC called for a Congressional investigation of
CIA. Richard Gibson, acting national secretary of the FPCC, said he
based his call on an announcement of a "Revolutionary Council" set up
by the two major anti-Castro groups in Miami. Gibson said there had
been reports of CIA support, of an anti-Castro enterprise and that forces
had been using Florida as a training and staging point for attacks
against Cuba. He said that reckless.-CIA action could lead the country
into a major war.

an American Marxist and journalist, provided information pertaining
to the formation of "Revolutionary Africa (RA)", a magazine which was
an organ of the Politbureau in Algeria. The editor of the English
language section was to be Richard Gibson. Schleifer had worked with
Gibson in the FPCC movement but had lost some of his confidence in
Gibson as a true revolutionary after the latter "jumped" at a bureaucratic
position with the Politbureau. Schleifer had lived with Gibson in
Algiers and regarded him as the same type of man that Djilas (not
further identified) had denounced in "The New Class" (not further
identified), Gibson's position with the Maspero (not further identified)
group, and thus the FLN (not further identified), predated his ‘i
involvement in Cuban affairs. Schleifer pointed out that long before
the Cuban revolution, Gibson had been working in France with the French’
™eo-Marxist” left. He had considerable editorial ability and should
have been an asset to "Ra" @

an article which appeared on 3/20/68 in "Tidsignal", a leftist newspaper
in Sweden, entitled "This is How LBJ's Agents Operate in Sweden" by
Bo Hammer (not further identified). The article concerned alleged
activities of US agents in Sweden to persuade American deserters in
Sweden to return to the Army. It alleged that Richard Gibson, who
professed himself to be a journalist and pretended to belong to the
Black Power movement had been instrumental in persuading Ray Jones,
one of the first deserters from the US Army in Sweden, to return to
Frankfurt. Gibson, who lived in London, Eng., was said to have visited
Sweden no less than four times and on his lasttrip had claimed to
represent American Negro leader Robert Williams who was in China.
According to the article Gibson's main interest at that time seemed to
have been Jones. Jones! relationship with Gibson and attempts by the
deserters to unmask American agents in Sweden were set out including
their contacting Gibson in London for that purpose. Details set out.

In connection with a claim by the American Deserters é
Committee, Sweden, that agents for the CIA had tried to infiltrate the l
committee to break it up, it was determined at CIA that Richard Thomas
Gibson, an informant of that Agency, had been maintaining some contact
with US deserters. Gibson had been involved in at least one operatioa
to influence a deserter to return to the US. Gibson also had been used
by CIA throughout Europe as a penetration of Black Power and New Left
groups and had been the source of considerable information from CIA.

The impression had been received that Gibson had possibly been compromised
and it could not be discounted that his involvement might become

publicized including the allegation of a connection with CIA. (Brennan

comments on and evaluations relating to the. validity and
usefulness of the information in the reports are set forth:

1. Sugar's recent presence in the United States (\
\

expressed no suspicions relating to his activity or cover.

2. Based upon preliminary review, the information i
provided by Sugar appears accurate and generally conforms to {jd
© information independently reported by our sources. Slight >
distortions noted were in accord with existing rumor or "talk"
within domestic movement circles.

3. The information provided by Sugar is considered
ef good intelligence value, but not in itself of high or

j
exceptional value. It confirms and supports information 15
developed by Bureau sources and in several instances provides i
current assessments and useful investigative leads. -

4. Sugar's obvious close association with Richard
Ward (indicated in reports 8-52 and S~56) would appear to offer
him an opportunity to establish a stringer relationship with |
the weekly New York City left-oriented "Guardian," in the a we
event this is in accord with the projection of his cover. >)

Republic of North Vietnam representation in Paris and would
appear to be in a position to provide an entree for Sugar

relating to Ward (report 8-56) suggests Ward as a likely S

NOTE:
Sugar is CIA cryptonym for Richard Gibson who operates
in behalf of CIA from London, furnishing coverage. of European !
and Third World New Left and black extremists. The 29 reports
furnished by the Agency on 10/29/70 covering Sugar's contacts
while in the U.S. from 9/24-10/11/70 have been disseminated to,~

Richard Ward is included on the Security Index of ,
the New York Office and he is a current staff member of the
"Guardian!" He was in contact with the North Vietnamese
Diplomatic Mission in Paris in 5/70 and traveled thereafter
to Hanoi and Laos for a five-week visit. According to the i
information made available by Sugar, Ward is critical of the ‘4
"Guardian," the Soviets, and members of the New Left in this fe
country. He is currently doing research on a book about
American-Vietnamese relations and he claims this book will be,
scholarly, other than a propaganda piece. Based upon a current;
assessment of Ward by the Agency, we will consider interviewing
him, looking towards his development as an informant.

19 September 1970
Dear Herb and Comrades,

Just a hasty note to let you know that René and
Gilbert have recently returned from Amman with news
about the desperately critical situation there. Never-
theless, we believe the situation is excellent for the
revolutionary forces, despite the seemingly crushing
weight of the reactionary, imperialist’ forces.

Throughout Europe, initiatives are being made
by comrades, especially in regard to Arab embassies,
needling them or coaxing them to show solidarity with
the Palestinians or demonstrating against the most
reactionary (e.g. the Jordan Embassy here was occupied
by students yesterday). Cables, le rs and personal
ealls peing made to Arab governments and their
diplomats throughout Europe, and the Iraqi and Syrians
shamed ve their inact heir past ;
verbal support of the i it would
be especially useful fox you .comrad in the States to
inform René and me of any activity that you are engaged
in on Palestine and please send us for republication
texts of any statements, cables, etc.

Manu and Diane send-you fraternal greetings. They
are now married, by the way, and await reinforcement in
the revolutionary ranks in December!

There is a possibility I might make it to the States
sometime this fall. [If so, ill try to come to Chicago
to give you a first-hand report on the situation in these
parts, as well as the Middie East.

Fraternally yours,

of "overseas representative and correspondent" for “Negro Press
International," which is allegedly a Chicago-based firm. From his nae
residence in London, Gibson furnishes coverage of European and Third.
World New Leftists and black nationalists. iS) -

CIA has advised Gibson will be in the U.S. for consultations
with the Agency, during the period 9/20-10/18/70. During this period it
is anticipated Gibson will visit New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta,

San Francisco and Leibel Bergman and Davida Fineman who are asso-

Reference is made to your memorandum dated April 20,

h . routing slip dated April 4, 1970.{S)

NLS

\ This article was obtained by our Legal Attache,
a \ London, presumably from a review of the public press.

\ It is noted in December, 1969, Leibel Bergman, the
i x 3 theoretical leader of the militant Maoist San Francisco-based
w¥X Revolutionary Union, according to a source who has furnished
WS % veliable information in the past, indicated shortly after
i meeting Gibson he distrusted him because of Gibson's reputed
Y

k
affiliation with the Central Intelligence Agency. At-this *
time, Davida Fineman, alse a member of the Revolutionary Union
(and the former paramour of Gibson), defended Gibson, repeatedly’

stating the charges against him were unfounded and the “same i
§ old stuff." Nevertheless, Bergman at the time persisted in
y his suspicion of Gibson 13)

1970, Bergman commented that during his travel the previous
month abroad, he had met with Gibson in Londen and stayed
overnight at the Gibson residence, At this time, Bergman

3 As a matter of additional interest, in February,

k stated he found Gibson to be charming, likable, sophisticated,
1 intelligent, but hung-up on a feeling of self-importance.
G) Bergman described Gibson as doing "good work," but stated
<5) Gibson is not as important as he believes (6)

‘ oa From the above it would appear Bergman, who may be

} t described as an astute tactical Marxist-Leninist, now accepts

\ Richard Gibson. Any additional pertinent information believed “0

fl to be of interest to you regarding the activities of Richard E
Gibson will be promptly made available (3) :

In view of this latest development, it is most strongly
urged that the Bureau, through liaison, have CIA interview "SUGAR".
specifically concerning the following points: i

(1). Any and all knowledge "SUGAR" has
concerning activities and contacts of
HOWARD BRUCE FRANKLIN while the latter
was in France. t

(2) Any and all knowledge of DAVIDA
FINEMAN. In this connection, it is
suggested that CIA be requested to
encourage correspondence between: "SUGAR"
and FINEMAN.

(3) "SUGAR" furnish CIA with all corre-
spondence to and from the RU and that
"SUGAR" be directed in a logical way to
encourage such correspondence with the RU.

{

In view of LEIBEL BERGMAN's admitted difficulties over
communications with Red China and lack of knowledge of current .-
events in that country, it is believed that if "SUGAR" can
favorably establish himself with the RU as a contact in Europe
he will be able to furnish valuable information on any other
contacts the RU may attempt to establish on the Continent and
might even be utilized as a cutout by BERGMAN for the RU.

Cr

In view of the delicate nature of the information
contained in the LHM, the Bureau may wish to restrict dissemi-
nation to. CIA only. -

In referring the above requests to CIA, the Bureau S
should insure the bona fides of "SUGAR" as a CIA operative and
his reliability lest SF 3169-S be compromised. 4

San Francisco will continue to follow this matter
with SF 3169-Ss.

RICHARD GIBSON
INFORMATION CONCERNING |

_.. <n June, 1969, a confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that at an Executive
Committee meeting of the Revolutionary Union (RU) held on June 8,
1969, DAVIDA FINEMAN read a letter which she had received from
RICHARD GIBSON, whom she described as. a Negro who ‘resides: in
Europe and whom she knew while she was in France. This letter a
was a run-down on the Marxist-Leninist-Mao.groups in various
countries in Europe and described some of these groups as
revisionists who support the new working. class, e.g.’ technicians
and other highly skilled labor, and support.a broad“tinited front
which would include various members of the bourgeoise.

According to this source, BRUCE FRANKLIN in no uncertain
terms described GIBSON as a CIA agent who was exposed as such
and had to flee France lest he be killed. - FRANKLIN stated that .
he had proof of GIBSON's affiliation with CIA. LEIBEL BERGMAN, -
on the other hand, stated in’no uncertain terms’ that BRUCE ck
FRANKLIN's allegation was completely untrue and that GIBSON hse |
had been thoroughly checked out when BERGMAN, himself, was in : g }
Red China and had been found to be all right. BRUCE FRANKLIN
continued the argument by stating that he could prove that
GIBSON was a CIA agent ‘because some friends of his in France
had been exposed and arrested shortly after their introduction

to. GIBSON. : -
: . , : j
At the Executive Committee meeting, it was decided :
that LEIBEL BERGMAN and the FRANKLINs were to iron out their 5 !
differences about GIBSON amongst, themselves and it was

further decided that the RU maybe in contact’ with GIBSON.

CG 100-41353

Referenced communications concerning RICHARD GIBSON
reflect that in 1966 former CG 5908-5, when in contact with
pro-Chinese communists in Italy, was apprised of the suspicion
of the Italians concerning RICHARD GIBSON, specifically that he
was a CIA agent, In connection with their suspicions, the
Italians requested the informant to check on one DAVIDA FINEMAN,

“who was ostensibly traveling with GIBSON as a translator, It
was subsequently learned that FINEMAN was residing in Paris
at that time but had been a resident of New York City.
Referenced communications from New York and Los Angeles
concerning FINEMAN identify her background, Chicago has no
additional information concerning this person and does not,
in fact; have sufficient. knowledge to determine whether the
person traveling with GIBSON in Europe in 1966 is identical with
the DAVIDA FINEMAN who has emerged as part of the Revolutionary
Union, :

The Bureau and Los Angeles are requested to furnish
to San Francisco any information which would assist in effecting
an identification of this person, it being believed by Chicago
that the definite possibility exists that the person traveling
with GIBSON is in fact identical with the current member of the
Revolutionary Union.

»

. Chicago would desire to know when FINEMAN returned
to the United States and if she has any recorded activities
within left wing movements since returning. It would seem-
that her emergence in the Revolutionary Union is highly
suspect in view of the probability of her former association
with GIBSON. As GIBSON's identify is known to the Bureau and
the interested office, it would seem that the implications
of a CIA operation are clearly apparent. a

In this connection, San Francisco letter of 10/30/63
reflects that HODEE EDWARDS has apparently returned to the Unite
States from England and San Francisco is presently attempting 2
to verify h@ér residence. In connection with EDWARDS, it will °°
be recalled thatshe had written to the Ad Hoc Committee while .
a house guest of RICHARD GIBSON in London concerning some
theoretical aspects of pro-Chinese ideology and that GIBSON,
while in contact with CG 6547-~S in Chicago, had furnished the

RICHARDS recently wrote to the Ad Hoc Committee expressing
his favorable attitude toward the ideology as expressed by
the Committee and the! possibility exists, therefore, that
he was prompted.to do so on advice from his yother, HODEE
EDWARDS, : :

The totality of these events suggest that CIA has
effected operations in this country with the possible intent
of attempting to arrange for travel to China, and Chicago
strongly suspects not only FINEMAN but EDWARDS and RICHARDS
as’ being part of these operations.

Chicago respectfully requests any information the
Bureau may have in this matter. '

Q

Concerning "Comrade" Laski, nothing further has been
heard of nim since he left nere for Paris. His great com-
rade here, Mike Baker, who published a huge interview with
Laski. in his publication, Red Front, also took to attacking
what he now calls "Meo's ultra-Lert cligue." Whether Laski
approves of Baker's new anti-Mao line, I cannot say, but
birds of a feather do flock together...

The person living with me that you mentioned in your

letter is a lady, mother of the young student at the Univer rsity

of “Wisconsin that you met at my hotel in Chicago when I was
Tact there. He is still very much in the revisionist party,
although deeply disturbed by its general reformist, not to
say capitulationist line, yet still greatly swayed by some
of the CPUSA tame intellectuals, particularly ‘Apteker,, I-do
wish you comrades might help him to understand the correct
line and find a way forward.

Give ny regards to your wife, who I trust has now completely

recovered from her pout of poor, health.

‘Fraternally yours,

_ RichardG: son
