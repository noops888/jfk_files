Continued contact with TP 52-S, PSI VICTOR

PASETTI, and TP 262-S has failed to reflect any organized

activity of captioned organization in the Tampa area.

that recently ENRIQUE JOMEILLAN, Representative of the MIRR

In Tampa, had delivered a letter to JOE/HERNANDEZ, Manager

of. the local Spanish language paper, "Traduccion Prensa, "

containing a statement from ORLANDO/BOSCH, head of the MIRR

in Miami, to the effect that the MIRR was not initiating

in any new activity against the Cuban Government, but that

it had never ceased its activity in attacking the Cuban

Government.

This statement, according to TP 52-s, was

made by BOSCH, in

reply to an article appearing in "Diario

De Las Americas," Miami, some three weeks previous. to

receipt of the letter stating in effect that the mifk was

planning to renew its bombing attacks on Cuba. BOSCH

stated that the MIRR had never stopped fighting for the

freedom of Cuba.

TP 52-S advised that the remarks of BOSCH

were never printed by the "Traduccion Prensa."

Since the above article was never printed, this

information is not considered of sufficient value to

• warrant

dissemination.
