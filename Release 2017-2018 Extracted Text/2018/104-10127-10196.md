1. STATION UNCLEAR AS TO PURPOSE SE

D BY PUBLICATION

DUBIOUS THAT SHE WOULD QUERY ABSENCE IN REPORI OF PHOTO

SHOWN HER SEVERAL MONTHS

OR, WHICH DOUBTFUL SHE COULD

IDENTIFY AS SAME PIC IN.

ANY CASE. IN UNLIKELY EVENT SHE DID

QUERY, THIS WOULD FL

INTO PUBLIC CONCEPT OF HER SHREWISHNESS.

SPREAD OF CROPPED PHOTOS ALL OF WHICH TO APPEAR, NO OBJECTION
