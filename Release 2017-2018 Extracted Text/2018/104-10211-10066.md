SUBJECT: Report of Interrogation of 10 August 1965

1. Todsy's session was from 1100 to 1200 and froa
1300 to 1500. It wae largely devoted to a review of Eub-
Jject's ailitary ranks and awards, but inevitably a nusber
of related topics were touched upon. Subject was also
questioned about bis father's funeral, and about menbers
of the praesidium and the Soviet Government generally.

2. Subject vas first asked whem and where he first
entered on active military service. He said that normally
people vere called up at the age of 18, and I told bis that
the age was 19, but 18 if the person has the equivalent of
a full secondary education. He-said he was never called
into the srmy, but received'a deferment because bo ras a
student et the Institute of International Relations. In
June or July 1947, at the end of his second year at the
Institute he received the rank of Jr. Lt. of the Reserve,
2s did. all his classmates... He received his first voyennyy
db VB) the end. of 1945.or early 1946, at tke
nugeet for his place of residence at Ul Granovskogo,

thought it might have been Krasnopresnenskiy
rayon this is correct, end is the first time he bes cor-
rectly mentioned a rayon in which he lived). This was aa
ordinary enlisted man's VB. In 1947 this YB was replaced
with am officer's VB. In neither case was Subject able to
give an adequate description of how the documents were
issued, nor did he have any ides of vhat was in thes. He
does not know in what branch of service be was (except
that it was not the navy), what bis sostav /category/ was,
or his MOS. He said that the military registration desk
was located in the voyenkomat, whereas prior to 1958 they
were actually located in the Militia Sections.

3. Subject said that he first went om active militery
service when he entered Naval GRD. This vas in October

1950, although the processing had started in the spring.
He deregistered from the oyenkomat in September.

Be left for the Far Bost immediately. Questioned about
the procedures involved in processing for his departure,
Bubject was totally unable to describe the correct docu-
wsente and procedures, and even said that he travelled in
civilian clothes. If Subject had ever been a naval offi-
cer anyvhere (or for that matter sn officer in any branch
of service) he could easily have invented satisfactory
sasvers to my clementary questions; instead he appesered to
be improviging answers on the basis of very inadequate
knovledge.

4. Subject gave the following chronology of his
military ranks: i

daly 1947 - Jr. Lt. of the Reserve °
October 1950 - Jr. Lt.

April 1951 (while in Far East) - Lt.

uy April 1953 (in HVD) - Sr.
October 1989 (KGB) - Capt.
October-Hovember 1963 (KGB) - Lt. Colonel

In no instance does he remember who signed the order of his
‘promotion to a new military rank (normally, one would
‘ Yenenber at least a few). I told Subject that it was im-
ae possible for-him to have been: promoted in the MVD in April
i 1953, or st any time in March-June and even lster in 1953-
because not one single person in the MYD was promoted at
this time. le looked astounded end at first seemed unde-
cided what line to take, but finally said that he couldn't
Say about anyone else, but he was sure that he received
i bis promotion at that time. (In fact, this is excluded.
All promotions were held up from Peria until late 1983.)

8. Bubject said that he was put up for captain in
1956, but that the promotion vas blocked by LYALIH--who
was deputy chairman at thst time and e member of the pro-
motion board--on the grounds that Subject should be made
to wait because of shortcomings in his work. Subject
said that be was proposed for major in 1959, but only re-
ceived captain. At that time, he was promised by GRIBANOV
that he would be promoted directly to Lt. Colonel the

thir. waa impossible, and pointed out to him that not even
the. astronaut. GACARIN--had been.able..to.skip a rank. Sub-.
ject simply insisted that this is what had happened. He
gaid that he didn't know why he should have gotten such
pecial treatwent, and could only suppose that allowance
was made for his long stretch as a Br. Lt. and the fact
that he was a deputy chief of department. (Subject's
story does not hold wa no matter how you turn it;
if his career had ‘proceeded normally he would not ha
been eligible for Lt. Col. before 1964.) Asked why he had
previously told us that he had been s major (in the auto-
biography prepared in Frankfurt), Subject said he did not
think we would believe the true story.

6. Subject was then questioned briefly on the famous
VD incident. His story about the investigation of this
incident does not conform to normal practice in such cases,
and is not believable. Still worse is his account of the
consequences this incident had on his Komsomol standing.
Be maintains that the vzys! Aya (punishment) was removed
from his record in Octo! » just a few months after
the incident. This is never done in-less than.a.year,.....
especially for such a sprious offense. His explanation
that this was done to enable him to leave the Komsomol be-
cause of age without a black mark on his record is simply
absurd: for a KGB officer to leave the Komsomol because
of age and without entering the. Party is a black mark in
itself, and would ¢nevitably mean expulsion from the KGB.
Bubject was completely unable to describe the procedure
Aimrolved in turning in-his Komsomol card. He admitted
that he was the only member of the SCD who was not either
im the Komsomol or the Party, but maintained that no one
had ever even talked to him about it. he

7. Subject said he received the following medals
awards; 7

Medal for Victory over Germany - 1945-46
Medel for Defense of Hoscow - 1945-46
Medal 40 Years Soviet Army - 1957 a
Medal 3rd Class, for Honorable Service,
10 years - 1962 or 1963
Order of Red Star - end 1961

In regard to the Bedal for Honorable Service, 10
years, Subject first said he received it in March 1963,
then. corrected himself and said 1962: - Asked why not ‘in
1960. (it takes into account both military and KGB service), -
Bubject said be didn't know why it was so late, that it

was personnel's fault, possibly because of the reorganiza-
tion of the SCD. These are nonsensical enswers, end it

is obvious that Subject is unsure about when he should have
received this medal, remembers the previous interrogation,
and is being careful. {

: Asked what he received the Order of the Red Star for, Re
Subject was. extremely evasive. He claimed not. to remember ;
the.exact formulation of the order, and perbaps slipped
when he said "For exceptional performance of mission."
When I asked him what mission, he said that it was just for
good work in general.

Bubject also said that in 1959 he was put in for the :
Order of the Red Banner because of his tourist recruitments, Fl
but did not get it, probably because he was transferred to
the First Department at the time. Remipded about his pre-
vious boasts about the Order of Lenin, he said that it. was
promised to him in 1963 but he did not receive it. Sub-
ject did not say what it would have been for.

8. I asked Subject if he had attended theopening of
the. Deerzhinskiy Memorial in front of the KGB building.
Bubject quickly said that he wasn't there and that he
didn't remember when it was opened or where he was at the
time. He. refused to estimate whether-this took place:
under BERIYA,.KRUGLOV, SEROV, SHELEPIN, or SEMICHASTHYY, oats
and looked uncomfortable when reminded that it was a very
big event, attended by DZERZHINSKIY's wife and son, among rota
others. (It was opened on 20 December 1958--the 4lst Sete
birthday of Soviet State Security--and was attended by
KERUSHCHEV and all other praesidium members.)

9. Subject was asked to describe his father's funeral.
This he did in a satisfactory manner. Asked vhere he had | a
come from to attend this funeral, Subject replied that he ere
was in Moscow all the time of his fathe: illness frou.

May 1956 until his death in August 1956 with the exception
of a few days TDY in Kiev (this would be for the BURGI

case, about which Subject will be questioned next time).

Of possible interest is Subject's remark, appropos of noth-
ing in particular, that the portrait of his father that
hung in the House of Columns and was published in the papers

residences ‘and’ private lives of theSoviet hetrarchy;~
especially those who lived either at Granovakiy or Berafi- -
movich Streets. The results were inconclusive: Subject :
did cot make any mistakes, nor. did he have any sensational
revelations. Asked what residences he personally visited, a
he said only BULGAHIH, KOSYGIN, MALYBHEV, TIMOSHERKO, : 2
MIKOYAN (dacha),.SECBERBAKOY. Subject said he did not know ie
where KOBULOV lived. in Moscow.

11. At the end of the session Subject was reminded
that previously he hed said that he received his first VB
im Leningrad. Ee admitted that thie was wrong, but said
he got some sort of documents connected with his schooling
through the yoyenkomat in Leningrad; however, he could not
remember what documents they were.
