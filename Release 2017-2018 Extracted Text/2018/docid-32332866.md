the MANNARINO brothers,

that SAMUEL MANNARINO's hunting lodge is not locatea in

drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland. The informant

recalled that he had been in the office of SAMUEL MANNARINO

during December, 1957, when the press and radio carried

the first accounts of

the fact that GABRIEL MANNARINO had been

called before the Federal Grand Jury in New York. He stated

that shortly thereafter SAMUEL MANNARINO received a telephone

call from GABRIEL MANNARINO in his presence and hurriedly

told him "they are

off for the brush "trying to serve you with a subpoena. Take

The informant stated that it seemed

logical to him that if SAM MANNARINO's

remarks were interpreted

Iterally his advice could have been his subtle way of telling

his brother to proceed to the hunting lodge. .

The aforementioned informant said that according to his

source of information, the general area surrounding the

lodge is thickly populated with whiskey stills, and that local

game wardens are reluctant to enter the area because some of

them have been mistaken for Agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco

Tax Unit and have been fired upon by the moonshiners.

The Philadelphia Office was requested, through the Recorder

of Deeds for Franklin County, Fa., to attempt to identify

the aforementioned lodge and to display photographs of

MANNARINO ana LA ROCCA at Waynesboro, Pa., and vicinity near

the Maryland border to game wardens,

rellable police olficers,

and other sources to locate the hunting lodge and determine

whether MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding out in that locality

or

have been there in the past six to ten months.
