residence in that city. Although the Baltimore Office has
temporarily given up contacting GOLDBERG because of his critical
illness, it is felt that he may be contacted at a future date.

Session of the Federal Grand Jury as requested by HUBERT

I. TEITELBAUM, United States Attorney, Western District of
Pennsylvania, at Pittsburgh.

On October 29, 1958, the Philadelphia Officewas advised that

T-4, who has furnished considerable reliable information concem-
ing the legitimate enterprises of the MANNARINO brothers and
particularly information concerning real estate transactions
involving SAMUEL MANNARINO, had advised during February, 1958,
that SAMUEL MANNARINO, during the early portion of 1957, mentioned
that he had purchased a hunting lodge surrounded by 200 acres

of land, At that time the informant understood MANNARINO to

say that the lodge was located in Somerset County, Pa., and
extensive investigation thereafter was conducted to identify

the hunting lodge since several sources in the Pittsburgh
vicinity believe the lodge would be an excellent hide-out for
GABRIEL MANNARINO and his close friend, SEBASTIAN JOHN

LA ROCCA, who disappeared from the Pittsburgh vicinity duping

The Philadelphia Office was further advised that the two afore-
mentioned top national hoodlums were also being sought by Senator:

on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Fields.

In connection with the aforementioned efforts ito identify

the location of the hunting lodge,the informant originally
furnishing this information, learned on October 28, 1958,
through JACK KRUPA, a New Kensington, Pa., councilman and life-
long friend and hunting companion of the MANNARINO brothers,
hat SAMUEL MANNARINO's hunting lodge is not located in
Somerset County, Pa., but is actually a twenty-room farm house
generally referred to as a hunting lodge, surrounded by approx-
imately 200 acres of densley wooded land in Pennsylvania near
the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, approximately a fifteen minute
drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland. The informant
recalled that he had been in the office of SAMUEL MANNARINO
during December, 1957, when the press and radio carried

the first. accounts of the fact that GABRIEL MANNARINO had been
called before the Federal Grand Jury in New York. He stated
that shortly thereafter SAMUEL MANNARINO received a telephone
call from GABRIEL MANNARINO in his presence and hurriedly

told him "they are trying to serve you with a subpoena. Take
off for the brush." The informant stated that it seemed
logical to him that if SAM MANNARINO's remarks were interpreted
literally his advice could have been his subtle way of telling
his brother to proceed to the hunting lodge.

The aforementioned informant said that according to his

source of information, the general area surrounding the

lodge is thickly populated with whiskey stills,.and that local
game wardens are reluctant to enter the area because:some of
them have been mistaken for Agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco
Tax Unit and have been fired upon by the moonshiners.

The Philadelphia Office was requested, through the Recorder
of Deeds for Franklin County, Pa., to attempt to identify

the aforementioned lodge and to display photographs of
MANNARINO and LA ROCCA at Waynesboro, Pa., and vicinity near
the Maryland border to game wardens, reliable police officers,
and other sources to locate the hunting lodge and determine
whether MANNARINO and LA ROCCA are hiding out in that locality
or have been there in the past six to ten months.

The New York Office advised on November 20; 1958, in reply

to a request to interview FRANK JOSEPH VALENTI, who is confined
to the New York City Civil Jail, that the New York Office believes
“it inadvisable to conduct such an interview inasmuch as there
is no indication that he would be willing to cooperate with

the law enforcement officers at this time. It was further
noted that there is no indication that he could be interviewed
with full security and that his interview might be subjected
to public notice. It was also advised that the activities

of those confined are being very closely followed by the New
York State Crime Commission, and that former Special Agent
JOSEPH MILENKY, Chief Investigator for that body, is advising

B701 Clarinth Road, Baltimore, Maryland, advised
v ie¢ sister of MAX GOLDBERG, ther, personal accountant
for LA ROCCA, and that she is’ employed as a secretary in his
office, She advised that GOLDBERG is eritically i111 in the

New Kensington General Hospital and is suffering from an ulcerated
colon and other complications, She advised that doctors have
said that this illness could be fatal and if not, will cause
GOLDBERG to be incapacitebed for some time. She stated that

she was certain that LA ROCCA. had not contacted GOLDBERG or

any of the members of his staff in the recent past and that

if he does so, she will immediately contact the Baltimore Office
of the FBI.

C,. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

T-5, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised
that he has been unable to develop any information concerning

the present whereabouts of LA ROCGA, He stated that LA ROCCA's
associates have been very secretive of late, but that he has

an idea that LA ROCCA and GABRIEL MANNARINO may again be in Warren,
Ohio. He agditn surmised that they had been hidden in the past :
by CHARLIE MURGIE of Warren, Ohio, and that MURGIE had taken

them to Florida. He stated that he had reason to believe that
they were staying close to home as he had learned that the wife

of LA ROCCA is going to have an operation soon,

is a subpoena for the appearance of LA ROCCA before the U.S.

cannot do anything further regarding them until LA ROCCA
returns to Pittsburgh or is located in some other jurisdiction.
He advised that he will notify the Pittsburgh Office in the
event he should learn anything regarding LA ROCCA in this
regard.

Surveillances Conducted Relating to this Investigation -

Other than those surveillances conducted at Mercy Hospital,
Pittsburgh, which have already been set forth spot surveillances
were made. on October 24; November 3, 7, 24, 28; and December

10, 1958, at 900 West Ingomar Road, Ingomar, and at 12 McCandless
Street, Pittsburgh. Nothing of interest to this investigation
was observed during these spot surveillances.

Other Matters of a Miscellaneous Nature

“me Pittsburgh Press" carried a front page article in its
October 28, 1958, issue entitled, "Probe Spotlight on
Chauffeur of Mannarino.” The article stated that a new Ken-
sington, Pa., man named THOMAS SONNY" CIANCUTTI spent sometime
on October 28; 1958, with the Federal Grand Jury at Pittsburgh.
The article stated that there was speculation that the Grand
Jury was asking CIANCUTTI, reputed to be the chauffeur of
i racket boss GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO, where MANNARINO is
presently hiding. It said "KELLY" MANNARINQs, had been ducking
process servers with amazing success for several months since
New York authorities started investigating the “crime convention"
which MANNARINO attended at Apalachin. The paper said that
another man testifying before the Federal Grand Jury on
October 28, 1958, was JOHN FONTANA, convicted of vote fraud in
1954 and the reputed operator of New Kensington's Barbout game.
It should be noted that FONTANA is a close associate of MIKE
