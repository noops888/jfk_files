MEMORANDUM FOR: Passavoy rs
SUBJECT : Carlos Bandin and Alberto Junco

+

1. It has come to our attention that Miro has been
attempting to arrange a meeting with Carios Bandin, a
MRR faction leader. Rumor has it that Miro is disturbed
by the attitude of that MRR Group represented by Guillot,
Caesar Baro and Dr. Lasaga which ia Presontly affiliated
with the CRC, Miro should know that the Guillot Group
is very effective operationally, Wo intend to support
this group as one of the xery few capable groups presently
functioning, We have had experionce with Bandin and his
group. Our findings were that the group is insecure,
dishonest and too competitive to deserve support.

2. For the past six months we have waited for the
MDC to enter the fight actively. They have not. Alberto
Junco, one of our agents, ciains a large MDC following
"inside" end has been Pressing for support. We directed
him to Miro. Junco claims his approach to the CRC was
unproductive. Does Miro intend to continue the "do nothing"
Lucas faction? How does he regard Junco?

3. It will be appreciated 17 these matters are dis-
cussed with Miro. An indication of his reaction will,
likewise, be appreciated. 2
