CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING RECEIPT OF LETTER
On May 20, 1965, VICTOBYBALBUENA, 1158A S.W.

6th Street, Miami / appeared at the Miami Office of the

FBI and made available the enclosures. He stated that

his sister-in-law, MARIA MORENO BALBUENA, the wife of

LUIS BALBUENA CALZADILLA, received the letter at her
residence on May 19, 1965. She became very upset upon
receiving the letter and requested VICTOR BALBUENA to

turn it over to the FBI. #The letter has been handled by
MARIA MORENO BALBUENA, VICTOR BALBUENA and one ALDO ENRICH,
a friend of MARIA MORENO's husband, LUIS BALBUENA u)

INTERVIEW OF MARIA ESTHER MORENO MERCANTITY

MARIA ESTHER MORENO MERCANTITY furnished the
following to SAs MAURICE F. FARABEE and CLARENCE P, GRAHAM
on May 27, 1965.

MARIA BALBUENA received the enclosure at her
residence, 418 S.W. 10th Street, Miami, Florida, on May 19,
1965. It was addressed to Mrs. MARIA E, BALBUENA, 418
S.W. 10th Street. She became frightened and fearful that
in some way the receipt of her letter would jeopardize her
chances of getting her two children out of Cuba to the
United States. As a result, she tore off the front of the
envélope bearing the sender's name and address and threw it
away. She recalls, however, the sender had the surname
BENAVIDES (first name not recalled) and a New York City
address. The letter was postmarked May 18, 1965, in New
York City. MARIA BALBUENA disclaimed any knowledge of the
sender of the letter.

MARIA BALBUENA, a doctor of pharmacy, owned a
drugstore in Guantanamo, Cuba, in the years prior to the
ascension to power of FIDEL CASTRO. Her husband, LUIS
BALBUENA, was a long-time employee of the U. S. Government
at Guantanamo Base. He actively participated in anti-CASTRO
activities while employed by the U. S. Government on the
naval base at Guantanamo. Because of his anti-CASTRO
activities, it became necessary for MARIA BALBUENA to
flee to the United States, which she did with her. infant

child, LUISA BALBUNA, having arrived on a visa waiver at
Miami-on July. 6, 1962. She has two other children, NORA
BALBUENA, age 11, and FRANCIS BALBUENA, age 10, which she
was unable to secure visa waivers for, and left them :
behind with her mother and father, MERCEDES and SAEVADOR
MORENO, in Guantanamo. They were to secure visa waivers
for the two children and send them to the United States
to be with MARIA BALBUENA. However, to date, MARIA
BALBUENA has been unsuccessful in getting them to the—
United States. Her husband, LUIS BALBUENA, was subse-
quently brought to the United States by the U. S. Navy.
MARIA BALBUENA had written many letters to her parents

: in Guantanamo expressing her homesickness and her desire
to see the children, as well as get them to the United
States, but she has never indicated a desire or interest
in returning to Cuba. She has paid approximately $200 to
several persons in the Miami area in an effort to get visas
for them to come to the United States but on each occasion,
the persons were unsuccessful. Recently, MARIA BALBUENA
has been sending money to a priest in Spain in an effort
to get visas for her daughters, to get to that country.

On or about May 7, 1965, MARIA BALBUENA called
her father in Guantanamo, Cuba. He told her he had
recently been to the Immigration Service at Santiago
de Cuba concerning the daughters and the Immigration
authority informed him that for the daughters to leave
Cuba, all the property belonging to the parents would
have to be turned over to the Cuban Government. The
grandfather explained to the Immigration authorities —
that all the parents' property had previously been con-
fiscated. The Cuban Immigration official then.informed
MARIA BALBUENA's father that it might be possible for the
daughters to obtain a departure permit in the latter part
of May, 1965.

Z WARDA BAEBUENA has a distant<relative named OSMEL

H FRANCIS, who was associated with the Cuban Government and ~~

has been a Commun: for many years. When she left, Cuba

in 1962, he Bae-aR“International attorney employed at the

Rancho Boyeros Airport in Cuba. Prior t her departure,

she went to see him for assistance and at that time, he

refused and stated that if it became necessary, he would

kill MARIA BALBUENA's husband in order to protect the

Cuban Government.
