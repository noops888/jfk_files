6th Street, Miami, appeared at the Miami Office of the

FBI and made available the enclosures.

He stated that

his sister-in-law, MARIA MORENO BALBUENA, the wife of

LUIS BALBUENA CALLADILLA, received the letter at her

residence on May 19, 1965.

She became very upset upon

receiving the letter and requested VICTOR BALBUENA to

turn it over to the FBI. The letter has been handled by

MARIA MORENO BALBUENA, VICTOR BALBUENA and one ALDO ENRICH,

a friend of MARIA MORENO's husband, LUIS BALBURNA A U)

MARIA ESTHER MORENO MERCANTITY furnished the

child, LUISA BALBUNA, having arrived on a visa waiver at

Miami on July 6, 1962. She has two other children, NORA

BALBUENA, age 11, and FRANCIS BALBUENA, age 10, which she

was unable to secure visa waivers for,

and left them

behind with her mother and father, MERCEDES and SAIVADOR

MORENO, in Guantanamo.

They were to secure visa waivers

for the two children and send them to the United States

to be with MARIA BALBUENA.

However, to date, MARIA

BALBUENA has been unsuccessful in getting them to the

United States.

Her husband, LUIS BALBUENA, was subse-

quently brought to the United States by the U. S. Navy.

MARIA BALBUENA had written many letters to her parents

in Guantanamo expressing her homesickness and her desire

to see the children, as well as get them to the United

States, but she has

never indicated a desire or interest

in returning to Cuba.

She has paid approximately $200 to

several persons in the Miami area in an effort to get visas

for them to come to the United states but on each occasion,

the persons were unsuccessful. Recently, MARIA BALBUENA

has been sending money to a priest in Spain in an effort

to get visas for her daughters, to get to that country.

On or about May 7, 1965, MARIA BALBUENA called

her father in Guantanamo, Cuba.

He told her he had

recently been to the Immigration Service at Santiago

de Cuba concerning the daughters and the Immigration

authority informed him that for the daughters to leave

Cuba, all the property belonging to the parents would

have

to be turned over to the Cuban Government.

Bo the Ca

The

grandfather explained to the Immigration authorities

that all the parents' property had previously been con-

fiscated.

The Cuban Immigration official then informed

o ration of

MARIA BALBUENA's father that it might be possible for the

daughters to obtain a departure permit in the latter part

of May, 1965.

MARIA BALBUENA has a distant relative named OSMEL

FRANCIS, who was associated with the Cuban Government and

has been a Communist for many years. When she left, Cuba

in 1962, he was an international attorney employed at the

Rancho Boyeros Airport in Cuba.

Prior to her departure,

she went to see him for assistance and at that time, he

refused and stated that if it became necessary, he would

kill MARIA BALBUENA's husband in order to protect the

Cuban Government.

MARIA BALBUENA stated she intends to take no

action concerning the matter out of fear of jeopardizing

her chances of getting her daughters to this country.

However, should she receive any subsequent letters,

AMARIA BALBUENA stated she does not want to furnish

BALBUENA CALZADILLA, was a former source of the Miami
