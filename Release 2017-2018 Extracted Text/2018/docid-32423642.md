APPARENT FROG MISSILE CONTRADICTION

STATEMENTS:

Ms MaNamars

Nr. Hughes:

(Briefing)

Ihts photograph wee taken of the LaBoca

Pier area (Mariel) on 27 Dee 62. Again our

atreraft are weeping back and forth and

obeerved this Soviet ship moving into the

harbor area from out in the ocean sector,

at that time, we aleo observed parked at

dockeide 10 probable frog missile trans-

porters along with their support equipment.

This ship pulled in, this equtiment was

apparently loaded, and moved away from the

LaBoca area. This le one of the firet

photograghs that we have flrming up at least

the fact that some of the Soviet tactical

rocket forces have deperted the leland.

(p: 34 - Spectat Cuba Briefing)

Nr.. McNamarad

Recently, our reconnaissance has

revealed that certain equlment of these

Soviet combat forcen, namely that associated

lth the tactical rocket units, has also

started to be moved out of the island back

to the Sovlet Unlon:

(p: 36 - Special Cube Ertefing),

Mr.. MeCone

Mr. Kendall:

Nir. McNamara said also, I belleve,

Mr. McCone, that the frog misalles were

being sent back to Russia: There has

been no previous mention by anyone that

any of these have been ahipped out. What

is your postion on this?

Mr. MaCone:

Some six weeks ago,: we noted that

ten or 12 frog missile luchers were on

the dock at Martel, I believe, and

presumably were loaded on a ship,

We

continued to carry the number of miesiles,

of frog: mistles, and launchers, in

Cube that I mentioned yesterday, which

the

range ie 24 to 32:

Mr. Cline:

That ls the nssiles themselves.

Mir. McCone:

Those are the missiles themselves.

Mr. Kendall:

Have you ever carried more then that

estimate?

Mx. McCone :

I do not bellere so, no:

John Scall, ABC:

Mi. Secretary, you said that certain

equipment associated with the remaining

Soviet forces has started to move out.

Can you give us some details on that and

what you think it means?

Mx..

McNamara:

Yes, I don't wish to over-emphasize

this point, I don't wish to mislead you

into thinking that there are clear indica-

tions that the four Soviet combat forces

which I described as having on the order

of 1, 200 men apiece, roughly 5, 000 in total,

are at the present time moving out of Cuba.

But it is a fact that certain of the equip-

ment formerly assigned to those forces,

specifically certain of the rocket equipment

has been moved out of Cuba, What this

Implies for the future, I can't state.

(p. 39, Spectal Cuba Belefing)

FACTS:

On 6 November 1962 low-level photography revealed five probable frog missile

transportere and two probable frog missile launchere at the Remedios Military Camp.

On 9 November 1962, a sixth probable transporter was sighted. Based on these figures.

plus the esdstence of four such major Soviet military campe, it was estimated that

from 24 to 32 frog missiles were probably in Cuba (assuming 3 or 4 missiles per

launcher). Subsequent analysis of all photography to date falls to reveal any

The estimate is baned upon what was seen by photography coupled

with knowledge of Soviet organiaation and practice.

On 28 Fecember 1962 high-level photography revealed ten probable frog

misalle transporters on the dock at Mariel, No frog rolesiles or frog misaile

launchere were detected. A Soviet merchant ship was simultaneously photo-

graphed approaching the dock at Mariel on which these transporters were

dotected. Photography on 29 December 1962 revealed no frog missile trans

Ann Bordone, Northern Virginie Sun)

Mr. Secretary, I gather from what you

day that in recent weeke Cuba has become

less of a military threat to the United

States than it was at the time right after

crisis, after the niesiles and the

bombers vere removed, less of a threat in

the sense of, I think you said, 5,000

Russians had returned to the lomeland.

It is a lessening threat to the United

States, fron what I gather.

Secretary McNamaze:

Cuba ls a lessening military threat

to the extent that the military personnel

of the Soviet Union and their equipment are

being removed. As you point out, 5,000 Soviet

military personnel have moved out in the last

eight or nine weeks, and there appears to be

sone continuing movement out. What the future

holde, I cen't say.

and the bombers were removed. It 1e

assumed that this personnel are the ones

that were in chorge of these units and

responetble for them, and aleo possible

some collateral support and security

forces in connection with those particular

weapons systems,

The removal of the troops occurred

almost concurrently with the removal

of the equipment.

Now, since then we have observed

what ve feel 1o a relatively static

situation with, as I said yesterday,

with some rotation. We are continually

getting intercepts, one as recently

as yesterday, speaking of going hone,

but ve interpret this from our observa-

tion es rotational rather than a

withdrawal.

Senstor Stennis:

I say I was avolding the interference

you certainly don't see any lessening of

the military strength after the with-

araval of the 5,000.

• 93-95, Testimony Stennis Comittee)

TAGES:

since the departure of the last contingent of the IL-28 bombers and the personnel

accomponying them, we have observed no significent change in Soviet military forces in

Cuba. There have been sone small shipments of military-associated transport and a

number of large crates which could contain additional constel defense cruise misalles

arriving in Cuba,

However, there have been no major changes in the personnel

pituation. Mr. MoConels statenent that;

"We are continually getting intercepts, one

as recently as yesterdav, speaking of going home, but ve interpret this from our

observation as rotational rather than a withdraval, " 1a contired es essentlally the

Interpretation of the Intelligence community. On thie basis we would consider the

present situation as one of neither build-up nor reduction but rather statie.

Regarding Mr. McNamera'a statement concerning;

"A lessening military threat,"

from the standpoint of offensive capabilities against the United States a currently

known and estimated by the Intelligence coumunity, this vould be a correct statement,

with the removal of the offensive MRiMs and the Il-28 bombere, the military threat of

Cuba vio-a-vis the United States in led then it wae prior to thie action on the part

of the soviet Union. However, there Lone

CONCLUSIONS:

The statement concerning "A lessening military threat" in the context of

offensive capabilities against the United States as currently inown and estimated

16 a correct statemert, (Lees than prior to the removal of the MiMe and IL-28

bombere. )

There is no definitive evidence to sbow that this is a contiming novement

but rather that the movement has been completed.

sunably be used for submarines carrying

These are very ominous, and important

developments, in my opinion.

(From the Inclosure to Memorandum to

the President from Mr. Mcdone dtd

7 Feb 63 which llete Mr. MeCone's

mublic and private statémenta.)

Mr. Kendal1:

Now, on the question of submarine

bese capability in Cuba, Mr. McNamaro

vas quite emphatic that there was none

end, as I recall, it wes your judgement

that the developments of such bases

was oither in being or very probably

for the future.

Can you verify your poattion on that?

Ms. McCone:

Yes, I think my position was that

there appeare to be under construction

a marine base the announced purpose of

which was to service fishing trawlers and

sindlar ships but I had no doubt but

what it would and could serve as a sub-

marine servicing base; that the existence

of such a base would be highly desirable.

However, we cannot say absolutely

that that particular base is to be a

ubmarine base.

(D.: 101 - Testimony Stepais Committee)

FACTS:

The joint Moncow-lavana announcement of the signing of an agreement to construct

"a fishing port" copable of handling a large number of fishing trawlers and the

facilities for processing the catch caused considerable amprebension and speculation

within the intelligence commnity as to the real purpose of thie port. It wan

speculated thet such a facility could be used as a bone for servicing Soviet submarines

at see; to have no evidence thet this is the intended purpose of the fishing port.

Mr. NeConed itatement that, "there appears to be under construction a marine base,"

is an unfortunate choice of words in that ow information indicates that construction

is due to begin in Februray 1963 and therefore the base could at best be onty in

the

inittel stages of conctruction. We have no evidence that work has actually started

on this construction. At the present time we are unable to deterine whether or not

the flohing port could be used as a submarine bage. At the request of DIA the Navy

has undertaken & study to determine the suitability for using this fishing port or

any other facility in Cube as a submarine base. This study should be completed

within the next week;

CONCLUSION:

There 1o no evidence that construction has started.

There ie no evidence that the fiahing port will be used ad a submarine base:

We have not been able to detemine whether tha fishing port site could be used

as & submarine base. (Study has been undertaken. )
