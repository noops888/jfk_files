OABRIEL MANNARINO, aka

SAMUENE

MANNARINO, aka

AR

on 12/18/61, PG 615-0 advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III

as follows:

914-747

In his opinion; the raid at the Mannarino gambling casino -

horse room in New Kensington, Pa., on August 24, 1961, by IRS,

Pittsburgh, was 1ll advised,

shortsighted and poorly planned.

For two years, Po 615-C has been attempting to obtain inereasingly

better information about the Mannarinos,

their illegal.

activities, their associates and their future plans. He

has done this without any thought of, or desire for monetary

compensation, simply because

che MANNARINO "strangle-hold, his firm conviction that

on all phases of life and

activity in the New Kensington area had to be broken.

In spite of, the obvious dangers to his professional reputation

and personal salety, he commenced a process of intiltration

due to his belief

that such things cannot be left to

"somebody else.

starTARY. 4322-10

By frequenting gambling establishments, PO 615-C met many

of the MaNNARINe employees, and by performing small favors

for them, professional and

otherwise, he became friendly

with most of them and the confidant of some of them.

They furnished considerable information, some more valuable

than others, but a compendium of their bite of information

was forming

a gradually clearing picture of the entire

MANNARINO operation.

on 12/19/61, PG 612-0, who 1s an experienced numbers writer

in the MANNARINO operationin New Kensington, was asked about

Deration 1a

the dearth of pertinent information being received, and

informant advised:

The town (New Kensington) has been closed down almost

completely,

as regards gambling, since the "Federal

raid

last summer" and since

the commencement of

the FGJ Inquiry.

Besides the numbers racket, which is down in volume by at

least half, there

are only three card games

in the city,

only one of which is operating on any given night:

Horse

bets, sports bets and dice games have been eliminated,

allegedly by orders of the MANNARINOS.' Men who have been

for years employed in one phase or another of the MANNARINO

gambling set-ups are

now loafing about town, and their

prineipal topics of discussion concern the rGJ hearings,

their belief that the newly-elected reform administration

in New Kensington will not allow

resumption of open gambling,

and their

"fears"

concerning their own futures.

With

regard to the numbers racket, elaborate security measures

have been put into effect, and only those possessing the

Federal Wagering Tax Stamp are permitted to participate.

In view of these facts, pertinent information has been

scarce

and unreliable.

Spot surveillances at residences, legitimate business

sites

and at known hangouts

during the past four months have been

wholly unproductive and tend

to substantiate the comments of

the above mentioned informants:

Due

to the situation

created by the IRS raid on August 24,

1961, and the resultant FoJ probe, as it affects receipt

by the Pittsburgh office of positive information concerning

the MANNARINOS and their actlvities, the Pittsburgh office

has found it impossible to comply fully with Bureau instructions

concerning submission of a dally teletype summary of pertinent

developments:

As matters now stand, the only readily discernible method

of collecting current positive information concerning either

MANNARINO is by establishing highly confidential sources.

In View of the above, PCI HERBERT LEE RAY, RD#3, Leechburg

Pa., GABRIEL MANNARINO's neighbor, was contacted on 12/18/61,

by SA FORSYTH, and PCI RAY was asked why he had furnished

so little information in recent months. PCI RAY advised:

Prior to the "Federal raid on the MANNARIN® gambling joint

in New Kensington towards the end of summer,

1961, he

observed some activity around GABRIEL MANNARINO' a cottage

near Leechburg.

While there were never any groups of visitors,

except for one

family-type outdoor pienic, occasionally

individuals would visit the cottage.: Also, GABRIEL

MANNARING was observed to leave the house almost daily at

varying hours.

since "the raid," GABRIEL MANNARINO

has developed what amounts almost to a predictable pattern.

He leaves the

cottage on most days shortly before noon,

always alone, and he returns to stay at about eight o'clock

in the evening. Visitors are extremely rare and never stay

more than a few minutes.

PCI has not been able to obtain

any information of recognizable pertinence and, therefore,.

has not. contacted SA FORSYTH.

on 12/18/61, PCI, ANTHONY JOHN WISE, JR., Pittsburgh, Pa.,

employed as Manager of the MANNARINO-owned Ken Iron and

Steel Co., New Kensington, was asked by SA FORSYTH why he

has not been furnishing and pertinent information during

the recent past, and he advised:

Even before the

"Government raid" in New. Kensington in

August 1961, he was not taken into the confidence of the

MANNARINOS as regards anything but their scrap metals and

a gas well businesses.

They put him in charge of these

two

ventures because of. his

education and prior experience

However, on occasion he overheard conversations involving

some of

their other interests and observed them meet some

of their associates and/or employees.

Since the raid, he

has not seen GABRIEL MANNARINO more

than three times and,

understands that GABRIEL MANNARINO is spending most of his

time at his cottage near Leechbürg, Pa., while SAM MANNARINO

spends the largest portion of each

day at his restaurant,

The Bonfire,

"located a few miles from Leechburg."

what he has

been able to observe and learn, SAM MANNARINO

and GABRIEL MANNARINO see very little of each other or of

their erstwhile associates. PCI does not feel that he can

probe for information from

either MANNARINO without arousing

their suspicions,

because it has been his habit to observe

and listen but not to ask questions.
