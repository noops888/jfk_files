’ GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka

SAMUEE MANNARINO, aka
AR ees :

i on 12/18/61, PG 615-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III
as’ follows:

In his opinion, the raid at the Mannarino gambling casino -
horse room in New Kensington, Pa., on August 24, 1961, by IRS, |
Pittsburgh, was ill-advised, shortsighted and poorly Planned.

For two years, PG 615-C has been attempting to obtain inereasingly|
better information about the Mannarinos, their illegal.,,
activities, their associates and their future plans. He :
has done this without any thought of, or desire for monetary Nh
compensation, simply because of his firm conviction that
the MANNARINO "strangle-hold" on all phases of life and
7 activity in the New Kensington area had to be broken.
In spite of the. obvious dangers to his professional reputation
a and personal safety, he commended a process of infiltration
due to his belief that such things cannot be left to
"somebody else."

2

By frequenting gambling establishments, PG 615-c met many
of the MANNARINO employees, and by performing small. favors
for them, professional and otherwise, he became friendly
with most of them and the confidant of some of them.

They furnished considerable information, some more valuable
than others, but a compendium of their bits of information
| was forming a gradually clearing picture of the entire
MANNARINO operation.

On 12/19/61, PG 612-C, who is an experienced numbers writer
in the’ MANNARINO operationimaNew Kensington, was asked about
the dearth of pertinent information being received, and
informant advised: ,

The towm (New Kensington) has been chosed down almost
completely, a& regards gambling, sinée the "Federal raid
last summer" and since the.-commencement, of the FGJ inquiry.
Besides the numbers racket, which is down in volume by at
least half, there are only three card games in the city,

only .one of which is operating. on any given night. Horse
bets, sports bets: and dice games have. been: eliminated,
allegedly by orders of ‘thé MANNARINOS... Men who. have’ been
for years employed in. one phase or another of the MANNARINO
gambling set-ups arenow loafing about town, and their
principal topics of discussion concern the FGJ. hearings,
their belief that. the newly-elected reform administration

in: New Kensington . will not allow resumption of open gambling,
and their "fears" concerning their own futures. With

regard: to the numbers -racket, elaborate security. measures
have been put into effect, and only ‘those possessing the
Federal Wagering Tax Stampsare permitted to participate.

In view. of these facts, pertinent information has been scarce
and unreliable.

abet surveillances at: residences, tenttémate business sites

‘and.at. known Mangouts during’ the past four’ months have been

wholly unproductive'and tend to substantiate: the comments of
the above. mentioned: informants.

Due to the situation created by the -IRS raid on August 24,

1961; and the resultant FPQJ probe, as it affects receipt

‘by the’ Pittsburgh Office .of positive information concerning

the’ MANNARINOS: and: their activities, the Pittsburgh office

has found it: impossible to comply fully with Bureau instructions
concerning submission of .a daily teletype summary: of pertinent
developments.

As matters ‘now stand, the only readily discernible method
of. collecting current positive information concerning either
MANNARINO is ‘by establishing highly confidential sources.

In view of the above, PCI HERBERT LEE RAY, RD#3, Leechburg,
Pa., GABRIEL MANNARINO's neighbor, was contacted on 12/18/61,
by SA FORSYTH, and PCI RAY was asked why he had furnished

so little information in recent months. PCI RAY advised:

Prior.to the "Federal raid on the MANNARINO ambling joint

-in New Kensington towards the end of summer,” 1961, he

observed some activity around GABRIEL MANNARINO's cottage

near Leechburg. While there were never any groups of visitors,

except. for one family-type outdoor picnic, occasionally
individuals would visit the cottage.. Also, GABRIEL
MANNARINO .was observed to lmve the house almost daily at
varying hours. Since "the raid," GABRIEL MANNARINO :
has déveloped what amounts’ almost: to a predictable pattern,
He leaves the cottage on most days shortly before noon,
always alone, and he returns. to stay at about eight: o'clock
in the evening. Visitors are extremely rare and never stay
more than a few minutes. PCI has not been able to obtain
any information of recognizable pertinence and, therefore,
has not. contacted SA FORSYTH.

On 12/18/61, PCI, ANTHONY. JOHN WISE, JR., Pittsburgh, Pa.,
employed as Manager of the MANNARINO-owned Ken Iron and
Steel co., New Kensington, was. asked by SA FORSYTH why he
has not been furnishing and pertinent information during
the recent past, and he advised:

Even before the “Government raid". in-New Kensington in |
August 1961, he was not taken into the confidence of the

“MANNARINOS as. regards anything but their. scrap metals and
. ga8 well businesses, They put him in charge of these two

ventures because of. his.education and prior experience.
However, om occasion he overheard conversations involving
some of their other interests and observed them meet some

of their associates and/or employees. Since the raid, he
has. not seén GABRIEL MANNARINO more, than three times and,
understands that GABRIEL MANNARINO is spending most of his
time at his cottage near Leechburg, Pa., while SAM MANNARINO
spends the largest portion of each day at his restaurant,
The Bonfire, “located a few miles from-Leechburg." From
what he has been able to observe and learn, SAM MANNARINO
and GABRIEL MANNARINO’see very little of each other or of
their erstwhile associates. PCI does-not feel that he can
probe for information from either: MANNARINO without arousing
their suspicions, because it has been his habit to observe
and. listen but: not. .to ask questions. 7
