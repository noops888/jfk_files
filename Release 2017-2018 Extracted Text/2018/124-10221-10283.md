said, She said BOSCH left Chile for about five days
around the middle of last, year, but she did not
say where he went,

"Referring to BOSCH's reasons for being in
Chile, she said: ‘He told me that he was here in Chile
because, I don't know, it was more peaceful, because
he liked it...I {uy rors that he didn’

talk about that,*

"She said she did not know of any contacts other
than casual ones that he might have had with Chileans,

The attention d interested offices is
invited to Section XXVI ch contains a partial
text of a report dated 10/8/76 prepared by the Ad Hoc Working
Group on situations of human rights in Chile, United Nations
General Assembly, This report contained information concerning
DINA, which in some instances is obviously incorrect and based
on rumors and heresay. For example, Page 296 of rerep indicates
that DINA Headquarters and office of DINA Director was located
on Marcoleta Street in Santiago at the former offices of the
Chilean Communist Youth, As previously reported, DINA Headquarters
and the DINA Director's Office are located at \ll Calle Belgrado,.
This fact is well known in Santiago and probably any taxi driver
in Santiago would be able to take a passenger to DINA Headquarters
on request, From the nature ofinformation contained in this
report, it appears that the Ad Hoc Working Group compiled information
volunteered by various Chilean dissidents concerning DINA operations
in Chile, Nonetheless, an extremely intoresting piece of informa-
tion is contained. on Page 300 of rerep, which identifies various
DINA premises in Santiago. One of the locations identified as a
DINA situs is listed in Paragraph (D) as an apartment in the San
Borja Housing Project. As noted in the above Associated Press
dispatch, BOSCH AVILA resided with his Chilean mistress at the
San Borja Towers Housing Development. (vw)

It would be extremely significant if it could be established
with any degree of certainty that BOSCH’?s apartment, was in fact
a location utilized by DINA, Accordingly, it is suggested that WFO
or the New York Office give consideration to ascertaining from
the Ad Hoc Committee Working Group whether the exact location of
the alleged DINA apartment in the San Borja Housing Project can be
identified and if possible the source, who identified the apartment
as a DINA location be located and interviewed. Gs)

AG shou e noted- that [advises
that invésTigatio! sclosed the exact address of BOSCH AVI’ and

his Chilean mistr' 's apartment as Building #1, Apartment #24,

Torres de San Borja, Alameda, Santiago, Chile. (>) i|
