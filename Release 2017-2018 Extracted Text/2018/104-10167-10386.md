1. On 2 June 1961 Major Van dorn received a Phone call in

friend of the Air Attache Office in Havana and now
an official of the FRD in Miami of the AMDIP-1 faction,
was calling Major Vaa Horn ca tehalfé of 40195) who was
standing next to him by tke paone. This is know to
be true because he and GARCLA could be overheard waile
GARCIA relayed him the conversation.

GARCIA told Major Van Horn that the purpose of the phone
call was to make an appointment for AMDIP-1 to see Van
Horn on that sane day. He said AMDIP-1 was leaving for
Washington and wanted to discuss with Van Horn certain a
i:forration he had received ta the effect that Alberto
ALBERTI, who was acting as Caief of tie Libezation Air
Force, was trying to overtarow tne Revolutionary Council
and tnat Van Hora nad something to do with tais too. Van
Horn told GARCIA to inform AMDIP-1 that oe was mistaken
about his aaving any part in the alleged ALBERTI plot to
overtarow the Council; that ae was in contact with !
ALBERTI in the capacity. of Assistant Air Attache complying
wita nis duties of liaison wita tae Cuban pilots in Miami,
and that as far as he knew, ALBERTI was not attempting to
Overtnrow the Council. GARCLA relayed this information ?
to AMDIP-1, and again told Van dorm that AMMIP-1 wished ‘to
have an interview with him before going to Wasaington j
and informing U.S. officials about the “plot”. |

Van Hora inforned GARCIA that he was very sorry but he i
could not see AMDIP-1. as ne was extremely busy makiag the

Mission Chiefs waich ne and the Air Attache, Colonel

Stevers, had to attend in Panama the coming Monday (this
was Friday), and also that AMDIP-1 was beyond his {
jurisdiction and he nad no authority to talk to him; :
GARCIA then said that was tov bad, and chat AMDIP-L would
