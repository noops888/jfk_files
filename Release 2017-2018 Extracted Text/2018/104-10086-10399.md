Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

». ogmmmmovens: REPRODUCTION PROMIBITED

ES 2s
From the time. the Mexico Station was opened {in April 1947) until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station(in 1955} the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK) consisted of multi ine
phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobile surveillance team and a
mail intercept operation.

ae : Telephone taps (LIFEAT) were placed by (@n employee of the Toca}

: oe elephone company who was] handled by a Station case officer. The number

of Vines tappéd was limited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
“3 American recruited agents.
Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer ~
assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station
on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both.a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

ot

& da



Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double Taned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

‘LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man” was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

“graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in-the middle of :
the block ‘south. It had a Planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The
purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by.a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILyRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips: LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959) due to the resig- .
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited ‘agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers. _
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used Tate iodel cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted afunilateral mail intercept operation,

{ETENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Hexicar)

Army officers. In 1961,(because of mismanagement by the Mexican~prin-)
Ceipats the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post; and in picking up the transcripts and the nares: There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Sonn Covers: REPRODUCTION PROIBITE!

In mid-1962, the Mexican “Officer in charge of LIENVOY (tha

Goint tap operation) asked the American officer_at the LIENVOY Tistening

_ post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban arid Satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverags). The Station immediately

Gisconnected all of the unilateral telephone taps on these Embassies so)

that they would not be discovered when the Mexicans hooked up their _)

(aps.__The Mexicansjsoon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, .there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

: ; i . C000ig,



iy a language other than Spanish or English were taken to siother Tocation
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of ‘Russian conversations, the translations
usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-
self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening al] photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so ona _night- time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initially until a complete roll of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

' photograph all Soviets, their families, al] foreigners, and cars with

| foreign license plates. Human error-did occur but. generally the agents

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed nischanical dif-

rat ROU TION, PROWATEB

Oswald came to the

Tarasoff for translation because. the caller was trying to speak in Russian.
There was some delay because Station personnel waited to compare the
photographs with the typed transcript. All-transcripts were made in :
either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

for operational leads.

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate .and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According ‘to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he-wants to go to the USSR to stay

- a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to Tequest
and even then, they could not issue thi a here (in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yt ingly this man

27 September 1963, Sovict Embassy Consulate 15-60-55

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa.- He is told to call back at.1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number ‘not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and ss to
he

. now what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa.
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger mani

%

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN Set representatives
i

for the boat "KALONIA", and needed row v: information. First
a-call was made to the first list: wie Soviet Embassy in the
Mexican telephone directory (whi out to be the Military Attache).
They got the phone number ‘late and the address. After’
making a call to the Co, earning that it would not be open
until 1130 hours, ALA it to the address to get. the needed
information.)

o Item 395, pages 7-and 8

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a.call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he’ spoke at. the Soviet Embassy
because she’ sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that lie doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not. advised. them of: a-change ‘of address so'will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.
