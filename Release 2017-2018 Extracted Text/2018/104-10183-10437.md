1. I had introduced AMBUNNY-1 and AMWHIP-1 to each other
24 May but the office was crowded, so there was very little
Opportunity to discuss operational matters. We met again
on the above date, after business hours, and ve wera able
to mect in private. Although AMWHIP told me that he was
delighted with AMBUNNY-1 herself, a3 he said the “Cubans
like that kind of girl -— not too fancy", he thought that
ly her previously working for the
would aake the operation very

Fisky. He said that {fpit were discovered that AMPUNNY-1 was
® penetration of the (JNBNAFU-19 office (by the Cubars} bis
connection with ODYOKE would thembe revealed, with the result
that all bis “connections” withGUNSNAFU-19, and “Habana” would
be lost. AMWIIP-1 opined that he thought it likely that ‘the
Cubans would check ber out in hivis>

2. AMWHIP suggested the’ Possibility of using a cutout
to fotroduce AMBUNNY-1 to the (UNBNAFU-19 installation. le
said he would explain in detail at a later time, what he
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any more than necessary

to AMBUKNY-1.

3. Also, AMWHIP.1 stated that he was unable to travel
to Paris before ald-June, as he nad sowe relatives coming
to visit him from Italy. After checking with DI UBALDO,

I subsequently informed AMMHIP-1 and AMBUNNY-1 that the

(5-4 @aris) operation was off. Both expressed relief. I told

(2-2

MPUNNY=1 that she could most likely sttll be utilized in
