to me and had referred to the plot against the President!

and HYDe.

STANLEY said he offered to go to few Orleans but the

Chief of Police told him it would not be necessary.

obtained from MARTIN previously because

the Warren Report

indicated that there was no conspiracy involved in the assassi

nation. of President KENNEDY. STANLEY indicated

that he was

reporting. this information now because from recent newspaper
