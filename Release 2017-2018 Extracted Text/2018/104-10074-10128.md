Joseph August RICORD (Subject of recent extradiction

Carlos MARCELLO (Station Traces: A Carlos MARCELO

Dino Vicent CELLINI (Station Traces; Information
from 1964 identifies Dino CELLINE as a well known gambler
and underworld gangster who formerly worked in Cuba,
His citizenship was given as U.S. (presumably naturalized).
In July 1964, he requested a visa for the Dominican
Republic. Dino and another unnamed brother were reported
py their sister Julia, in 1960, to have had long association
with dope and prostituion in Cuba, An LNERGO Document,
no longer available at Station (DBA-86263 of 10 July 1957)
is a long report on the CELLINI family.

Vicent ALOI (No Station Traces).

2, Station is aware that although LEAL's contacts make him
a possibly interesting target, he will be a difficult and wary
one, However, we are encouraged that we are right on target
in trying to get closer to him by LNYAPA's confirmation of his
associates and théir obvious connection with drug trafficking.

3. Please see paragraph 6 of Reference B, which requests
that a copy of Subject's 201 file be forwarded to us along with
any results you may have from a covert name check. Upon receipt
of Headquarter's approval of DAMOTA's approach to subject In Santo |
