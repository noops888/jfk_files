on September 20, 1958,

MARTIN SILK, confidential

source whose identity must be protected, personally advised

ASACH. K. MOSS as follows:

He, SILK, had been by the residence of suspect

SHOULDERS at noon and early afternoon of September 20, 1958;

that the conversation at the SHOULDERS residence rotated entirely

around the interview with SHOULDERS by ASAC H. K. MOSS on the

preceding day SHOULDERS commented as follows.

The FBI was

trying to Involve him in a criminal violation with respect to

a visit made by CLUBB to SHOULDERs residence, but SHOULDERS

expressed confidence that the facts would not

amount to a

He speculated that If the FBI had a real good case

even against his son, young LOU,

the FBI would have proceeded

immediately by Commissioner's complaint and warrant rather than

via indictment; that the latter method is used only when the

case is essentially a weak one.

He further commented that he

doubted i1 any action would be taken against himself for the

reason that news stories referred only to young LOU, and

certainly in view of all the press interest in SHOULDERS, himself,

had there been any possibility of proceeding against SHOULDERS

the newspapers would so have been advised.

He referred to

comments made by ASAC MOSS as to what would make SHOULDERS "talk"

and SHOULDERS clalmed that he implied that he had turned down a

$100,000 offer and when ASAC MOSS asked SHOULDERS to be a

Government witness against COSTELLO, SHOULDERS claimed to have

replied,

"How can I when I don't know anything?". It should be

noted this is contrary to the comment that SHOULDERS did actually

made to ASAC MOSS as related in the details of that interview

with SHOULDERs on September 19, 1958.

sHouldeRs then referred

to the "bad luck" that has befallen all of those who did get

the money, referring to the successful Federal Firearms Act

conviction of COSTELLO and the current severe heart illness

Of ROBERT BERNARL BAKER. In generalities SHOULDERS said it

was his opinion that in some manner or other the Teamsters

Union was utilized as a vehicle to dispose of the missing

CREENLEASE money. Referring to the efforts of the FBI to indict

him on the CLUBB
