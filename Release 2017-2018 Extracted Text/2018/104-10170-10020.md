tho Agency and the DRE can continue mutually beneficial

cooperation, |

2, The purpose of this conversation was to define

the more specific pointe of disagreepent a6 viewed by

Rocha, Before etartitg Rocha admitted that many of the

past disagreements were minor but had become "the Ber line”

thia wasn't condusive to good relations but added he was
so fed-up by thie tie that the DRE felt it was impossible
to discuss anything of importance with their contact eay-

have not been presented to thea. They would like
to know if the DRE ia going to be considered for

(4) Regarding the use of the Lie detector
I told Rocha I was not interested in bow the sub-
Sect ead broached vith thes but felt if they were
at all seriously interested in the security of their
orgintzatios, I found it hard to believe how they
could afford not to take advantage of thia aid to
oop themselves from being penetrated. The Agency
is cortainly concerned over the possibility that
a group with which abdeteze coopentiag could be
perotrated and he, Rocha, as the group leader should
