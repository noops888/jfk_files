by a doctor that he was paranoic. Once in a meeting of the American group

when one of the other members disagreed with him, he dashed a glass cup

against the wall. On a second such occasion, he threw a glass cup at

Jake ROSEN, which caused Rosen to have three stitches in his chin and five

in his biceps.. This second incident was hushed up only with difficulty because

the Chinese authorities learned of it when a doctor was called."

Z. The Peking CHINA YOUTH NEWS carried in its 5 October 1957,

issue an article by Joanne Grant, giving her impression of her visit to

China. She had the following to say in her article:

"You can see the future through the Chinese people. You can ob-

tain a firm conviction that China will continuously advance forward.. As a

western visitor, nothing impressed me more than the great power of this

country. Every person in New China is very modest but has great pride;

they are united, have self-respect, and respect each other. No one can

overlook China's advance; it is to be regretted that many people do not

have the opportunity to observe it personally. I like Shanghai very much,

because from the way Shanghai has changed I can really understand New

China. In the old Shanghai, except for the Chinese, everyone had special

privileges. However, everything has changed greatly. I am of the opinion

that from this, one can see the miracles which have begun in this great

country."

(be turned over his passport) and was most anti-Communist in public and

morally corrupt, and stated that only three members of the group, including

himself, made any effort to defend the U.S. against Chinese Communist

critics. The shortness of O'Connell's stay in Hong Kong prevented spending

New York during the early 1940's.

Charles SEEGER admitted Communist Party membership

ceased association with the Communist Party about 1943. He denied
