1. wAfter meeting with Mr. Warner, Mr. a others
from the (LPGLOBE staff, I telephoned Mr, Leonar ewman, Chief
of the Rackets Section, New York County District Attorney's office,
on Thursday, 6 February, and stated that I wanted to discuss a
matter not directly related to the Itkin case. I felt it was
necessary to explain to Mr. Newman that it was not the Itkin
case since we have been enjoined by the U.S, Attorney's office

from discussing the Itkin case with members of Mr. Hogan! i
Mr. Newman's immediate question was, "Does this involv 2

I said it did and would look forward to meeting with him at I0: 3
on Friday provided the weather permitted an on-time arrival in
New York,

2, At 10:30 on Friday, 7 February, I met with Mr. Newman
and Sergeant William Graf, a police investigator assigned to the
District Attorney's office to work on the Itkin case. It appears
that Sergeant Graf, in the course of his iny estigation of Itkin's
activities, came up with the information eal was working
for CIA, When Sergeant Graf first talked to Mr. Néwman about
this possibility, Mr. Newman thought he was jumping to conclusions
with insufficient evidence. However, Sergeant Graf continued his

investigation and more and more evidence pointed 4 CIA
relationshi I specifically asked Sergeant Graf if Itkin was aware
of | estiaton with CLA, and Sergeant Graf replied that
fr idence he had seen of the Itkiz Relationship
it was his opinion that Itkin does know “SE affiliation with
CIA, Mr. Newman commented that if Itkin knew o: OF

affiliation with CIA, we could be sure that this wo € brought
out by Mr. F. Lee Bailey during the trial of Itkin,

not contemplating prosecution o. jas the information
uncovered to date relates £ ) contacts with Itkin and
apparently there are no specific criminal charges against

tof hi Interpol which have been answered. Mr, Newman

had an interest of Mr. Newman did not state whether
the FBI had advis CIA's interest it 03§ Mr. Newman
asked me whether we would be willing to questio:
items that they had uncovered, I stated that this pose eal
problem and I was not able to give them an answer at that time.
I was concerned about certain conflicts in the event| 03,
answers invol i ation which could incriminate him. It
might be that, frou consider he had immunity from
prosecution when answéring questions put forth by CIA,

5. I did not describe relationship to CIA other than
to state he had in fact received some ini rom us and did
report to us. I intended to infer thai s an informant

in a similar capacity to that which ItkinZenjoyed earlier,

6 It should be noted that all parties to the Itkin case are
talking to each other. Mr. Newman said two days before I called

on the phone the ised him that CIA would discuss our
relationship with) with him, Later that day in Mr.
Morgenthau's office; e I met Itkin, FBI Agent Donovan

commented that he heard I had a good meeting with Newman,
It is not beyond belief that the FBI told Itkin that I had seen
