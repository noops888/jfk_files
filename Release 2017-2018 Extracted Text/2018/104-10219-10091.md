1, We have takea up reference with Chicf KUTUBE/D who
cowcludes that German's advice to Dr. White is not incompatible
with the feelings of ODINCH on the matter.

2, It is our understanding that the interest in having
Subject interrogated is not sufficiently high to warrant having
the advice to Dr, White counternanded.
