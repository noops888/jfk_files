Handelsman's most likely contact points are:

. Aaron Marks, cousin, 47 North Fullerton Avenue,
Montclair, New Jersey, telephone 201-744-4911.

: Debbie Weiner, Apartment 3K, 56 Seventh Avenue,
New York, New York, telephone 212-OR5-8129.

Handelsman, during the mid 1960"s, studied Inter-
national Social Work, in South America, under a Woodrow
Wilson Fellowship, where Handelsman became "radicalized"

. according to one of his college professors.

It appears Handelsman may be outside the U. S.,
possibly in a Latin American country.

After combatting many technical problems for over two years, ~

in U.S, and Puerto Rico. Of course, NSA is not furnished the categories
in which the individuals fall and it is known to NSA only as the FBI
Cuban watch list. : :

: During the past year positive returns have been received
concerning from five to 15 subjects each month. Basically, the products
are open messages sent to or from the subjects on the list and nothing
significant has been developed concerning intelligence activities on

stops enable us to confirm presence pf subjects in Cuba who abandoned
their U.S. residences and ‘to. verify continued residence in Cuba of

‘many other subjects which could not be accomplished by any other

to assist in the curtailment of militant anti-Castro
expeditions, we desire the identities of yarticinants to

assure the United States Government is aware of persons

whose activities should be monitored in the future. Detailed
information regarding the operations of United States~based
exiles in Cuba and countermeastires taken by the Cuban Government
are also of prime concern from an intelligence standpoint

ain view of the possibility that some participants are working
in collusion with the Cuban Gevernment and have wittingly led
exile forces into a Cuban Government trap.

Our most pressing problem in the Cuban field is the
identification of individuals in the United States who are
elandestinely transmitting intelligence information to their -
principals in Cuba. We are constantly analyzing information
provided by you concerning indicated illegal agent traffic
being directed toward the United States from Cuba. Your
ZeunRical assisvancs. is vitally important in our efforts ta

pinpoint the areas wherein the recipients of the messages reside.

Qur specific requirements in furtherance of the
foregoing objectives are being furnished your Agency as they
arise. Your further assistance in efforts to curb activities
on behalf of the communist Cuban Government, as they relate

_to the United States, will certainly be appreciated.

NOTE:

Classified "Secret" since reference is made to
\National Security Agency's (NSA) efforts in the foreign
“intelligence field, which information is so classified by
NSA. Unauthorized disclosure of this could seriously affect
national defense interests.

NSA has capability of monitoring messages to and from
individuals on Cuban Special Section of Security Index, Security
Index subjects residing in Cuba, mail drop addresses in Cuba,
and other areas of Western Hemisphere, and Cuban military
traffic pertaining to exile raids against Cuba, including the
eventual fate of the participants. While NSA cannot decipher
Cuban intelligence messages, it does have capability of pin-
pointing general areas to which intelligence messages are being
beamed from Cuba and in past years we have been able to identify
Cuban agents through this capability.

CY - CUBA apt
INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA ve CLS Lie

Since 1962, National Security Agency (NSA) has been providing
valuable services to the Bureau in the Cuban field. Coverage afforded
by NSA is virtually the only source of information relating to many areas
of FBI responsibility. concérning \|pro-Castro Cubans and the Cuban
Intelligence Service (CUIS) ‘yadio traffic to Cuban agents in the U.S,
This coverage is particularly of interest to us at the present time because
of irrefutable evidence from a defector that an illegal Cuban agent in
the U.S, is developing information concerning President Nixon's Key
Biscayne, Florida, residence, staff and associates.

. NSA provides a broad picture of Cuban activity which enables

! the Bure. u to stay tuned to developments which could have a positive
effect on pro-Castro activity and CUIS operations inthe U.S. Of
particular value is information furnished regularly concem ing clandestine
conferences held in Cuba which are attended by U.S, citizens, some of
whom are radicals and other rabble-rousers.

It is well known that NSA is having to make drastic reduction in
personnel due to the President's drive to reduce Government spending.
This will almost certainly result in reduction in or curtailment of various
programs which NSA has had in effect. Because of thé value to the Bureau
of NSA monitoring of Cuban activity, it is believed the Bureau should make
this known to NSA for their use in evaluating the éffectiveness of their
various;programs. Thus, before making any arbitrary decision to cut back.
. in an aréa.of d definite interest to the Bureau, NSA will be fully apprised of
: our interest. 7 Accordingly, a letter to NSA is ee _ iin

telephone:

During the previous week, a meeting was held of the
Program Management Resources Review Group, a US Intelligence Board
committee whose function is to review and coordinate acquisition
of intelligence and assign priorities as a means of precluding
duplication of effort. FBI does not normally participate in meetings
of this Group. It was indicated that the Director of Central
Intelligence (DCI) had recommended that acquisition and analytical
work by Butler's group be terminated. Butler indicated he had to
prepare rebuttal material for the Director of NSA by 10/3/73 and
that he was inquiring informally as to the FBI's position in the
event recommendations of the DCi were approved. Butler further
indicated he did not feel that an cect ea would be

necessary from the FBI at-this. Tongs tL . fos - a“sy Fa ~

Butler was reminded that letter dated 5/8/72 (copy
attached), FBI had officially levied collection requirements on NSA
to provide information to assist in our counterintelligence mission.
Since that time Butler's group has given us detailed analyses and
breakdowns of numerous one-way coded radio broadcasts emanating
from the Soviet Union and Cuba which are believed directed to illegal:
and illegal agents in the US. They have also provided us with prior
interceptions of coded radio traffic directed to subjects, of our
"Palmetto" investigation which have permitted us to capitalize on
a cryptographic penetration of those broadcasts by FBI Laboratory.

RE: NSA WATCH LIST

As you are aware, the NSA Watch List has become an issue
in court trial in Detroit being heard by dudge Damon Keith (Keith decision).
Easicaliy, the issue involves whether the use of the Watch List to gain
information on domestic organizations or U. S. citizens is in violation
of the Kelth decision.

Office of Legal Counsel feels taat there is definite reason to
believe the use of the V.atch Liat in this resnect ia iegal. The Depart~
ment has yet to furnish an opinion In the matter.

The attached is the Watch List as furnished to NSA by the
Eureau and is current as of $/21/73.

Fach Section should review the List and indicate thereon those
organizations and individuals who should be retained with the above situation
in mind, \Where a recommendation for retention of a doizestic organization
or U. S. citizen is made, full justification must accompanythe List. Where |
aliens or foreign organizations are involved, no such justification is necessay

It must be borne in inind that in the event the court rules that the
surveillance of domestic organizations or U. S, citizens through the Watch
List procedure violates the Keith decision, those organizations and
individuals will be deleted from the Watch List.

-Please review this material and subu.it the reguested results
by c.0.b. 9/28/73 toSA BK. Horner, 712-C $&D, Extension 2005.

Dear Mr. Kelley: : Date.

In the course of acclimating myself to my new assignment
Iasked my staff to review with yours our Watch List procedures,
and they have been ‘ursuing that subject diligently.

Meanwhile, I thought it would be worthwhile for us, as the
heads of cooperating agencies, to correspond directly on the Watch
List matter. The need for proper handling of the list and related
information has intensified, along with ever-increasing pressures
for disclosure of sources by the Congress, the courts, and the
press, and naturally I am concerned ultimately for the protection of
highly vulnerable SIGINT sources. Of paramount importance, how-
ever, is to insure that the procedures we have established for
compiling the lists, and for changing them as needs dictate, remain
adequate and fully appropriate to our authorities and responsibilities.

Certainly, I expect NSA to remain as responsive to your
future requirements for information as we have to those of the past.
Also, as in the past, we at NSA will lack the wherewithall for veri-
fying the appropriateness of the Watch List entries,°and we will 7
continue to rely upon you, as the requesting agency, for that assur-
ance. However, the requirement for us to perform the NSA mission
in ways that remain unquestionably within the framework of our
existing authorities has never been more clearly evident. Iam 3
confident that current procedures are designed to insure that we do
so; however, I ask your help in my efforts to make doubl Sa Soe
that in the process of our providing you Watch List infor entos 62..927
acquired during the performance of our foreigh{intelligence missiontT 5 273
we do not — even inadvertently — exceed the letter or spirit of any |
controlling law or directive, SEE EEE

It would be of great value to me in establishing this kind
: of positive assurance if, at the earliest possible date, you will
1 review the current list your agency has filed with us in order to
satisfy yourself regarding the appropriateness of its contents,
and if you will reaffirm for me the adequacy of your agency's
procedures for making ‘changes to it.
