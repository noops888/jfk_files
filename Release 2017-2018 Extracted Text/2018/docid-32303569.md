The MRR, an underground movement formed in Cuba in mid-1959,

was composed primarily of

three larger groups:

(1) the ACU, under

Manuel F. Artime Buesa; (2) a military group under Major Ricardo

de la Lorie Valls; and (3) an air group, without planes, of 13

experienced pilots under Major Antonio Michel Yabor.

The ACU was in

existence prior to the Castro regime as the Cuban Catholic University

(CACU) students organization. In November: 1959, under Artime's

leadership, the majority of

the CACU membership joined with the

Rebel Army Officer group to become the MRR. In February, 1950, a

coordinated movement of anti-Castro exiles outside Cuba was formed

in Mexico and named the MRR.

Artime and Lorie were joint heads of

this newly formed group.

About the middle of 1960, Artime, who was

in the Us, reportedly began to act without authority from the MRR

Directorate, which resulted in formation of the MRR splinter group,

As a result of nationwide press, radio, and television

coverage of President Kennedy's 12/29/62 activities at the Orange

now was better known and his position in the anti-Fidel Castro

movement was greatly increased.

Artime

was considered young, immature, and highly ambitious, and many felt

that he would be the victim of his own publicity. [MM 639-S, 1/5/6317

flow of aid to the MRR which was led by Manuel Artime Buesa.

Some

exiles claimed that the MRR attack on Puerto Pilon in May. 1964, was

launched from the. Dominican Republic.

There was no evidence that

Artime was receiving support from the Venezuèlan Government.

His

failure to establish personal contact with the Venezuelan Administra-

tion during his 5/22-27/64 visit to Caracas, had provoked criticism

in government circles. Some disillusionment with the MRR was said
