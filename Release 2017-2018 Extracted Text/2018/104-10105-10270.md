Re: Autobiography of Mr. E, Howard Hunt, Jr.

Dear Mr. Morrison:

I'm writing at your request to confirm our several telephone
calls of yesterday.

Following discussions on Saturday, September 28, I went to
New York yesterday to inform Mr. Edward Chase, Vice President of
G. P. Putnam's Sons, Mr. Hunt's publisher, of the several changes
which you had requested and to which Mr. Hunt had agreed. As you
know, the publisher was quite unhappy about making these changes:
For one thing, he feels that certain matters of principle litigated in the
first Marchetti case should be reopened in the courts. For this reason,
I chose to place my primary emphasis in talking to the publisher on the
fact that Howard had agreed to these changes for reasons such as
decency and patriotism which seemed good to him, rather than that
the Agency had requested or demanded them. I'm happy to report that
following long discussion this approach met with success.

The following four changes required by you under the first
Marchetti decision have been made:

The above represent all of the changes which you absolutely
required under the Marchetti decision. There were also a few other
changes which you suggested and to which Howard agreed, and which
have now been changed in the book:

On page 63 (67): The phrase "an OPC chief" has been
substituted for "Frank Holcomb".

On page 220 (239): The words "once was" have been
substituted for "had been" with reference to the alias documentation
which the C.I.A. had provided. Incidentally, we decided at the
publisher's strong urging, to leave the phrase "alias documentation"
intact, rather than changing it to "old documentation".

Mr. Hunt's manuscript is now in what is called the blue~copy
phase, which apparently is the penultimate step prior to publication.
The pagination of the blue copy is slightly different from that of the
bound galleys, because of the insertion of photographs and footnotes
in their proper place. The blue-copy page numbers appear in paren-
thesis above.

Although I came away from my meeting with the publisher
feeling satisfied, you understand that I cannot vouch for the fact that the
changes which they promised to make will in fact be made in the final
version of the book. However, Mr. Chase's demeanor, and the air of
urgency which he conveyed, lead me to believe that the changes
mentioned above to which the publisher has acquiesced will in fact be
made.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for the
reasonable and fair-minded attitude which you and your colleague have
brought to this task, which I am sure is an unwelcome one for you.
