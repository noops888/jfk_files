No Information has ever been received why the MANNARINO family

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO's wife, JEAN, had no choice in her

selection of mate. The marriage was arranged between her

father, FRANK AMATO, of Braddock, Pa., and KELLY MANNARINO.

or one is made eligible, the only way one can become finally

accepted is by the commission of a murder.

Every man who is

considered a

"don", without exception, has at some time of

another killed someone.

Once a man becomes a

постера

"don," the only

way he can cease being such and can leave the "outfit" Is by

his death. The expression is used that "the door opens only

one way."

In approximately the middle 1950's, KELLY MANNARINO took a

great 11king to JOSEPH MEROLA and on several occasions told

friends

that he "was making" MEROLA into a "don."

on one

occasion, KELLY MANNARINO took MEROLA to New York City with

him where he introduced MEROLA tO VITO GENOVESE and MIKE

at which time KELLY told them he was making MEROLA

MIRANDAldon." On another occasion, KELLY MANNARINO gave

MEROLA a package and told him to deliver it to New York City

without opening 1t, and when JOE MEROLA had delivered the

package in New York City and, It was opened, it was found to

contain only cut up newspaper.

MEROLA was put to other tests,

such as arrests by the New Kensington, Pa., Police Department

all of which were designed to test him to see if he could be

trusted and would remain silent.

Because of this experience

with KELLY MANNARINO, MEROLA became aware that all of the top

leaders, both Nationally and locally, of racketeering are of

Italian extraction and are known to each other as

"dons."

Some of the

"dons" in the Pittsburgh, Pa., area are:

SAMUEL MANNARINO

KELLY MANNARINO

JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA,

all of New Kensington, Pa.;

JOHN LA ROCCA

MIKE GENOVESE

TONY RIPEPI

NORMAN ROTHMAN

NORMAN ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOs In their Cuban

and some Florida interests for many years.

ROTHMAN, l1ke all

other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, and when the

MANNARINOs have lost money in an Investment,

such as the Sans

Soul Gambling Casino, Havana, Cuba, which ROTHMAN

fronted for

them, ROTHMAN always

emerges with money.

ROTHMAN 's Cuban

connections are over-rated and when anything actually difficult

1s to be accomplished in Cuba, ROTHMAN ordinarily needs the

assistance of JOSEPH MEROLA.

Currently, ROTHMAN has the

franchise for the cocktail bar in the Bel Alre Hotel, Miami

seach, Florida, and his two sons are working at the bar.

ABE SEID, aka, Al Ross

Although AL ROSS has the reputation

of having killed

on many occasions, it is not believed that he deserves that

reputation.

He has never been known to brag about any kill-

ings.

ROSS, who is under order of deportation to his native

Russia, 1s worried that the U. S. Government will find some

nation which will accept him.

ROSS is very much in love with

his wife, MORMA, who is a nymphomaniac currently residing on

taking part'in any illegal activity to obtain money, even

though he 1s in serious financial straits.

JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard and most

trusted lieutenant.

KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his

protege and made him a "don."

After FONTANA's marriage about

a year and a half ago, he and MANNARINO had a falling out.

FONTANA thought that he was not getting enough money and

complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all

he was going to get.

FONTANA then made the serious mistake

of going over KELY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN

LA ROCCA, who subsequently reported this to KELLY MANNARINO.

Since then FONTANA has been relegated to an unimportant. job

fronting the Marbet Heating Company store in New Kensington,

and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO ganding

activitles.

Gun-running

Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it,

there is no guestion that SAMUEL MANNARINO was part of the

conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to

Cuba.

Originally the plans to take guns to Cuba were JOSEPH MEROLA 'S

plans and the guns were scheduled to go to FIDEL CASTRO.

In

the summer of 1958, AL ROSS told MEROLA that he could obtain

M-1. rifles and carbines.

MEROLA met ROSS at the Warwick Hotel,

New York City, and gave ROSS $4,000 as part payment for the

guns, which money MEROLA had received from CARLOS PRIO.

MEROLA was to return to the Warwick Hotel with additional

money in a day or so and did so, but AL ROSS did not show up. •

After MEROLA returned to Miami, Florida, MEROLA learned from

Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, that SAM MANNARINO

was interested in purchasing an Apache airplane. Because

MEROLA is a pilot and acquainted with airplanes, he looked

over the prospective plane with Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO and

advised Dr. PESSOLANO that the airplane was too defective.

After that, MEROLA assisted Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a Twin

Beech alrplane from a company owned by HAL DUPONT, Miami,

Florida.

When Dr. PESSOLANO told MEROLA that MANNARINO intended

to use the airplane to fly guns to cuban dictator BATISTA, ne

realized that these were the guns that had been promised to

him and that he was being double-crossed.

MEROLA then abranged

with Dr. PESSOLANO for MEROLA to accompany the pilot, STUART

SUTOR, on the first flight to Pittsburgh, for the sole purpose

of contacting SAM MANNARINO and asking him about the double-

cross.

After SUTOR and MEROLA landed at Allegeny Airport,

Pittsburgh, they took a cab to MEROLA's sister's house in the

Regent Square section of Pittsburgh and borrowed her car.

They drove to the Tour-Tel Motel on U.S. Route 22, Monroeville,

where they registered for the night.

MEROLA and SUTOR then

traveled to New Kensington, where MEROLA attempted to locate

SAM MANNARINO. MEROLA was unable to locate SAM MANNARINO, sO

ne went to Wilmerding, Pa., to the house of "Sarge" BOTTI,

where KELLY MANNARINO was hiding from the service of subpoenas.

KELLY MANNARINO stated that he knew nothing of the plan to

smuggle guns to Cuba, that this was one of SAM : MANNARINO's

"hare-brained" schemes, and that he wanted nothing to do with

MEROLA then returned to Miami, Florida, by way of Eastern

Alrlines. It was not until the pilot, STUART SUTOR, was

stooped with the second load of guns,

resulting in consider-

able newspaper publielty, that MEROlA realizee

that the

weapons had been stolen from a National Guard Armory in

Canton, Ohio.

MEROLA later learned from a source he could not

recall

that the burglary of the armory was committed by

GEORGE FLOREA and RICHARD STEWART, with help from a "inside

man," and that the guns had been stored

In the beer distribu-

torship owned by VIC CARLUCCI in Arnold, Pa.

RED GIORDANO,

who was convicted in this case merely because it was proven

he had bought some burlap bags and the weapons, when found,

had been wrapped in burlap bags, actually had nothing to do

with the case.

ANDY MANGINI, who was never brought into the

case, actually helped load and unload the guns from CARLUCCI's

beer

distributorship to the truck and from the truck to the

airplane.

Lottery

HYMEN MARTIN, aka, PITTSBURGH HYMIE, used to have the distributor-

ship in Western Pennsylvania of the Empire Treasury lottery

tickets, and since he was friendly with the MANNARINOs, they

allowed

his ticket to be sold at their numbers outlets

in and

near New Kensington, Pa. HYMIE MARTIN, with whom MEROLA became

friendly when MROLA was a used car salesman in Plotsburgh n

was the one who first introduced MEROLA to the MANNARINOs,

approximately 1954.

MARTIN, who now resides in Miami, Florida,

probably turned over the distributorship of the Empire Treasury

lottery ticket to his brother, NATE MARTIN, who 1s still in.

the Pittsburgh area.

Recently, "the outfit" has come out with the Pan American

Sweepstakes ticket, which is based on the running of the Dixie

Handicap horse race at Pimlico Track, Maryland, In the near

future.

"The outfit" compelled KELLY MANNARINO to take 10,000

books of these sweepstakes tickets, which he must aispose

of in his area of Western Pennsylvania.

Gambling Casino

The MANNARINO gambling casino in New Kensington,

Pa., operate:

Pittsburgh, which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are

transported from that section to New Kensington for the pur-

pose

of gambling.

Routine employees at the gambling casino

receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the

are horo

$150 weekly salary plus a small percentage of the net take.

It has been curious in the past to note that whenever they so

desire, KELLY MANNARINO OF SAM MANNARINO would walk into the

gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum

of money.

For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier

to give him $1,000 and not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the

risk of being killed.

Employees at the casino do not carry

weapons generally, buton occasions, when there is a rumor that

the casino may be robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOS,

goes about town fully armed.

Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to traffic

in narcotics or to operate prostitution.

Hideouts

During the long period of time, in excess of one year, that

KELLY MANNARINO was hiding to avoid service of subpoenas,

commencing in December of 1957, he stayed at two places:

the house of "SARGE" BOTTI, In Wilmerding, Pa., and the house

of FRANK D. "SONNY" AMATO,

the brother-in-law of KELLY

MANNARINO, who i resides..: In East McKeesport, Pa.

During the, period in 1958 when SAM MANNARINO was avoiding

service of

subpoena, he stayed, at least part of the time,

at the parish house of Mount Saint Peters Roman Catholic

Church, New Kensington, Pa.

F. POLICE PROTECTION AND POLITICAL TIES

New Kensington, Pa., Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and the majority

of his City Council have been "owned" by the MANNARINOs, since

their election approximately eight years ago.

At one time

JOE MEROLA, at the Instructions of KELLY MANNARINO, "wired"

the New Kensington City Council chambers, so that

tape

recordings of the proceedings could be made.
