described subject as "liberal", "left of center", "reformer", and

"fighter for unpopular causes". But all these witnesses felt he could

not be regarded as radical or subversive or a political extremist. A

confidential investigative source furnished documents indicating subject'g

Comnittee as subversive, and Indicating that he has denounced the conduct

of security clearances by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and has

actively advocated abolition of the House Un-American Activities Committee.

Employment

DURST INDUSTRIES, 409 Lafayette Street, Second Floor. Infornation fur

nished by Hrs. Jetta I. Silverstein, Bookkeeper.

Mr. Norman Redlich was already an officer of this company when I came

to work here in January, 1963. This 18 a firm operated by several

members of his immediate family and his mother is the President of the

corporation. We are a sonewhat small, friendly group and we do not

have formal personnel folders. We do not have applicants for positions

fill out application forms, because most of the people working here are

either members of the family or very close friends.

However, our records indicate that the social security number of Mr.

Norman Redlich is 101-22-9595 and his home address is 29 Washingtor

Square North.

He holds two different positions in the firm, he 1s

Secretary to

Durst and is President of our Wholely owned subsidiary,

Lafayette Brass Company.

MRS. TETTA K. SILVERSTEIN, Care of Durst Industries.

My affiliation idth Mr. Redlich is in a business capacity only. I regard

him as a very fine person, altogether upstanding and honorable. He 1s

also a very level headed and stable individual who makes a very nice

personal appearance. He seems to enjoy good health. I have never ob

served anything of an adverse, derogatoryor unfavorable nature about

any aspect of his personal life.

There is not the slightest doubt in my mind about his loyalty and patriotism.

To the best of uy knowledge, he would not affiliate with any radical or

subversive individuals or organizations. I an sure he is a discreet

pret in not a to mo

person in handling the most sensitive, important kind of iniormation.

I certainly would recoumend him for a position involving access to very

sensitive information.

JULES ROSENKRANZ, General Manager, Durst Industries.

Norman Redlich, who 18 President of Isfayette Brass and Secretary of

Durst Industries,

is my cousin.

This business is almost strictly a

family affair.

Of course, I have had the very closest social contact

ath him and have known him all his life, since his birth.

• He has been

with our firm since the time he graduated from lale University Law

School. Before that time, he worked for us on a part-time basis during

vacations and so on. We do not maintain exact personnel folders and

it is not possible to give you the specific dates he norked for us.

However, he possibly worked during sumers in 1947, 1948 and 1949.

Then when he graduated fron lale University Law School, he came to

work for us as an Officer of the company. Since he became concurrently

employed by New Jork University, he has devoted less and less time to

this firm.

I must say that he is a person of supreme qualifications and qualities

as far as his character and integrity are concerned. He is an unusually

bright individual and a very patient man. I could only say the most

favorable things about my cousin.

I would rate him as the very best as far as his status as a security

risk is concerned.

I would personally give him an absolute recommendation

for the most sensitive kind of assignment. At no time does he ever

repeat any confidential information he has learned on the very sensitive

assignment he has recently had.

He is far too discreet to go about

divulging information which should only go to the public through official

channels.

MRS. EVE VAN DYKE, Office Manager, Durst Industries.

I have known Norman since just after he was born. My acquaintance idth

his family goes all the way back to his grandparents. He has a wonder-

ful family background. Everything I ever heard about anybody related

to him is the very best.

I admire the fact that he came into the firm and worked up from the very

bottam. When he was going to law school, he worked here as just a File

Clerk and Messenger and even worked in the Shipping Department to Learn

the business from the ground floor up. After he graduated irom 1ale

University in 1950, he came here on a full-time period. Although 1

know his wife and children, my acquaintance with him is really on the

job only. His wife, Evelyn, is a medical doctor and they have two

His personal character and integrity are quite outstanding. In fact,

I would be happy to have a son just like him. He is a man of wonderful

personal habits, conduct, morals and behavior and in general, can be

described as a model person. He also enjoys a nice personality and 1s

very well liked.

He has a wonderful sense of hunor. He appears to

enjoy good health and makes an unusually nice personal appearance.

He

not only is emotionally stable, but is a very calm individual and this

is largely responsible for him being so well liked by other people. Hig

mother is the President of this firm wnich was founded by his grand-

father.

The only outside interest I know that Norman has is akling.

He also writes papers for a law journal. He is a remarkable individual

with a great deal of ability for his age. He possesses an unusual

amount of energy. I know nothing of an unfavorable nature about him.

He is not only not a political extremist, but I nould describe him as

just the contrary. He is a person who is very good in handling con-

fidential information.. I would not hesitate to recommend him for any

kind of a sensitive assignment involving our country.

BEN COHEN, Buyer, Durst Industries.

I have been working for this firm since 1933 and am not in any way

related to Norman.

I come in contact with him on the job only and have

no social acquaintance with him.

I can assure you he is a man of the highest character and personal in

tegrity. Whatever I have observed or heard about his personal behavior,

morals, conduct or habits is good. I think he is a non-drinker. He

enjOys

good health and is always neat and clean in his personal ap-

pearance.

There is no doubt about his emotional stability, in fact,

he is "like the Rock of Gibraltar". I know he loves to go akiing.

I can say he is one of the finest people I know and it is always a

pleasure to work for him because he is really a gentleman.

I would say that as far as his patriotism and loyalty are concerned, he

is first rate.

He is not a person who would affiliate with any subversive

or radical individual or organizations, to the best of my knowlodge.

When he got an assignment in Washington and returned here, as he does

about once a week, I once tried to ask him how things were going and he

absolutely would not talk about what he considered to be classified

I certainly would recoumend him for the sensitive position

I know he is in, because he is an unisually capable young man.

ment Record I have.

RUSSELI, D. NILES, Chancellor and Executive Vice-President, New York

University, Vanderbilt Hall, Room 440.

I think he is a good family man, concerning whose personal conduct,

behavior, habits and norals I have no questions. He is an unusually

bright person and I am sure that he possesses the highest professional

integrity. He is a man who is interestod in liberal causes. For

instance, he is very keenly Interested in the abolition of capital

punishment. He defends indigent persons at his own expense and time.

In this activity, he is somewhat aggressive, but his intentions and

methods of operation are most honorable. Although he is a person who

1s devoted to advancing social causes, I do not feel that he is an any

sense radical or subversive. He is a person who is interested in social

justice in the very best sense of that word. In doing this, he is a

very courageous individual and does not hesitate to defend unpopalar

causes.

I have no doubt whatever of his loyalty and patriotism. He would never

undertake any action that hould in any way be harmful or detrimental

to the United States Government. He is not a careless talker, nor does

I can best describe him as an extra ordinarily fine man of the highest

I have met his wife who is a Medical Doctor.

I know nothing of a derogatory nature about any aspect of his personal

life, character or personality.

I am sure he is a loyal and patriotic eitizen. He is a man of very

strong moral convictions. He is a sincere believer that capital punish-

ment is morally wrong and he devotes a great deal of his time to bring-

ing about 1t's abolition. However, I feel that he is not at all a

person of radical or subversive inclinations.. I think he is just the.

opposite of someone who should be called a political extremist. I

would not hesitate to recommend him for the important position he holds.

In fact, I did personally recommend him to Professor J. Lee Rankin,

who is still a part-time Professor on our staff. I still believe that

he is a man who is outstandingly suited for an important position on

what is commonly known as the "Warren Connission".

ROBERT B. MC KAY, Associate Dean, New York University School of Law,

Vanderbilt Hall, 327•

I had Norman Redlich in class about 1956 when he was a graduate student.

Since that time, I have known him as a member of our faculty fron about

1958 to the present time. I am also a rather close social and personal

friend of his and regard his friendship very highly.

I feel he is a person of very good character and integrity. This

applies to his reputation at this school and on the outside. His

personal attributes are excellent. I am also a rather close neighbor

of his, as I live in the next apartment house.

I know that he is very active in the New York Committee to Abolish

Capital Punishment. In this activity, I am in complete agreement witt

him, as 1 am in agreement with his other interests in civil liberties

regard this as a radical or subversive organization.

I am absolutely

sure of the fact that he is a person who would do nothing detrimental

to the interests of the United States Government. I would recommend

him highly for a sensitive position because I believe that all d the

activities in which he takes place are beneficial to our country. In

fact, what we need is a great many more people like him, and a great more

organizations like those in which he is interested.

I believe he is enotionally stable and enjoys good physical health.

Everything that I know about his personal life is favorable.

PROFESSOR PRANCIS J. PUTMAN, School of Law, New Jork University.

I was the Director of the Graduate School when Norman Rodlich was a

student here. I have also known him as a colleague since he became

an instructor and eventually a professor at the school. We often hate

lunch together and I consider myself a casual social acquaintance of

his.

As a person, I regard him very highly and have no doubt about his good

morals and behavior. He is a conscientious person who fulfills any

commitment which is assigned to him. One of his outstanding interests

is the abolition of capital punishment. I know nothing of a derogatory

nature about anything concerning his personal life, and I consider him

to be notionally stable and physically healthy.

I regard him as a loyal and patriotic citizen. He is keenly interested

in furthering civil liberties, but I do not believe that this is in any

radical or subversive sense.

He is a discreet person who does not talk

Loosely or boastfully.

Based upon a somewhat limited knowledge, I

would recommend him without hesitation for an important, sensitive

position involving serious interests of our country.

JAMES S. BUSTICE, Associate ProfessOr Of Law, New Jork University,

Vanderbilt Hall, Room 317.

I have known Professor Redlich since 1960 when I joined the faculty of

this school. In addition to our professional contacts, I am a very

close, social and good personal friend of his.

I can only sum up what I would have to say in the statement that I

could not find anybody about whom I would speak morehighly. This

refers to his personal morals, behavior and conduct. He is a person

that I value very highly both as a colleague and an individual. There

is absolutely nothing of an unfavorable nature that I could say about

him.

Furthermore, I regard him as a good security risk and have no doubt what-

soever that he is a loyal and patriotic American citizen. he is a man

who is very active in the field of civil rights, but not in a subversive

or radical sense. I would not describe any of his ideas or activities

as being politically extreme. He is a man of the utmost discretion.

I recomend him very strongly for the important position he now holds

with the Federal Government, because I could not think of a better

qualified person for having access to the most highly sensitive kind of

information concerning the interest of our country.

NORMAN DORSEN, Associate Professor of Law, New Jork University.

I met Professor Redlich three years ago when I joined the faculty of

the university. We both teach in the same field of Constitutional

Law. I am not a social or personal friend of his, except in a casual

way.

However, we do have a common interest in that I am the Director of

the Hays Civil Liberties Program. I believe that anybody should be

free to join any organization in which he sincerely believes. I feel

strongly that all civil liberty organizations are in the best interest

of our country, and there is no such thing as a subversive or radical

civil liberties group. I know that Frofessor Redlich shares my interest

In strongly furthering the cause of civil liberties. He is also very

strongly interested in the abolition of capital punishment. I firmly

believe that he would not do anything that in any way would be harmful

or detrimental to the United States Government. He is a discreet person

and I would be shocked if he was ever engaged in anything that is in any

sense unfavorable to our country. I would recommend him for an assiga-

ment important to the interest of our country, in spite of the fact that

we have had some personal differences. Although I would generally regard

him as a straightforward person, I was quite disappointed in the fact

that he disappointed me in a certain matter involving internal university

•affairs here.

I do not care to say just what it was, except that it was

an academic matter involving the university and it's faculty. He promised

me he would take a certain course of action, and then he did just the

opposite without notifying me. Consequently, I have quite some reservation

about his personal dependability. Howeter, this would not cause me to

hesitate to reconnend him from a national security point of view.

Although

we teach in the very same department, I have never been able to get as

close and friendly to him as I hould like, because he tends to be a

rather reserved person.

Tet, I regard him as emotional stable.

I must

say that he is a very conscientious, hard worker, who devotes himself

wholeheartedly to anything in which he is engaged.

I have only known Professor Redlich casually since he has been on the

faculty of this iversity from 1958 to the present time. Since my

acquaintance with him is of such a casual nature, I do not feel that

I am in any position to discuss him in regards to his personal life or

his status as a security risk. However, this is not because of any-

They previously resided at 6 Peter Cooper Road in New Jork City and had

been living there for five years.

I have never heard of anything derogatory to the reputation of Professor

Redlich as far as his personal reputation in life is concerned.

I have met him in my office and most of my dealings are of a business

nature. I mist say that I do not like to see him come in because it

usually involves sone kind of unpleasant hassling. At one time, when

bis lease expired, he came in for a new lease and I explained that he

could have one for an increase of six per cent in rent. I am sure that

he understood and agreed to this. However, a few days later, he returned

with the contract and stated that he had believed that I said it would

be a six per cent reducation and not an increase.

I just could not believe

that he misunderstood any such thing. I mist admit that I rather per-

sonally dislike him because of what I consider to be a very unprofessional

manner he assumes when he comes in her to deal in business matters.

consider him to be a rather difficult tenant, and certainly hould not

recomnend him as a person in anything connected with business dealings.

It seems to me that he just enjoys quibbling.

but this is only because of his business dealings and has nothing to do

portant to his status as a security risk. I was personally quite

annoyed because he created what I considered was an artificial and un

real color or integration issue in that building where he resides. It

had always been the custom to have front elevators for the tenants

and their guests.

There were rear elevators for service people.

He

went over our head directly to the administration of the university

and demanded that all persons, including service employees, be

permitted to use the front elevator. He stated that the putting of

service people in the rear elevator was de lacto segregation because

so many of the service people were colored. As this had nothing to

do for the real reason that the two elevators had been separate during

all the years of the existence of the building, I feal that he deliberately

created a false issue and could not understand his motive in doing so.

Consequently, I have been quite annoyed with him and frankly, mist

admit that I am slightly prejudiced against him in my evaluation of

him as a person.

Vermont where he goes siding. He seems to be an emotionally stable

person. I know he is a professor at New Jork University. He seems to

enjoy good mental and physical health and I know nothing unfavorable

about him.

I believe he was written up in Time Magazine about four or five months

ago in relation to his admirable activities in the field of civil rights

and minority rights.

He impresses me as a loyal, patriotic American. I know that he is a very

strong believer in integration of minority groups in the country. He

is not a person who would divulge important information carelessly. He

is a very intelligent person and as "smart as a whip". I would definitely

recommend him for an important goverment assignment.

TIMOTHY MC CARTHY, Doorman, 29 Washington Square North.

I have been employed here for more than eight years. I know that the

Redlich family has probably been here since 1956.

I regard the Professor as a man of very good reputation, character and

integrity.

I know hin to be a good family man and a non-drinker. He

appears to be emotionally stable and to enjoy good physical health. I

have never observed or heard or seen anything of a derogatory, adverse

or unfavorable nature in connection with his personal life, character

or reputation.

I am sure that he is a very loyal and patriotic citizen who would not

affiliate with any radical or subversive organizations or persons.

Actually, I do not know of any organizations with which he is affiliated.

He is not a person who discusses his personal affairs around the building.

I would not hesitate to recommend him for a sensitive government assign-

ment.

conservative and would live well within his means. In addition to their

they go there in the summer.

I would have no reason to question Norman's loyalty or patriotism.

He

is very civic minded and belongs to the Greenwich Village Association

and the Washington Square Association. He would not take part in any

radical or subversive activities. He was a person I would trust with

confidential information.

I would also recoumend him for a very sen-

sitive federal assignment.

Room 333 Vanderbilt Hall.

I have known Norman Redlich since about 1949 when he was in Yale

University. I was formerly the Editor in Chief of the Tax Law Review,

which he now edits.

I was his Professor when he was a graduate student

at N. I. U. Since then, we have become close, social and personal

friends.

I am happy to describe him as a person of excellent character and repu-

tation.

I know that his personal morals, conduct, habits and behavior

are fine. He is a sober person of good mental and physical health. I

have always held him in the very highest regard and know absolutely

nothing of an unfavorable nature about him.

I have no reservations in my mind about his loyalty and patriotism. He

is a man who speaks up for unpopular causes. For instance, he is opposed

to capital punishment.

However, he is not a man who would do anything

detrimental to the United States Government. In fact, he is an excal-

lent eitizen. Although he is a very close friend of mine, he never

He enjoys the highest possible reputation as a man of good character

and integrity. He is a man of high ethics. I know that he has been

selected to serve on what is known as the Warren Connission, and this

is probably because he is such an unusually brilliant young man. In

fact, I have often tried to get him to come and associate with me in

my firm. He is a man who is very competent in tax work and an excel-

lent researcher.

He is also extremely imaginative.

Everything I know about his personal life is excellent. He is emotionally

stable, physically healthy and a devoted family man. I could not think

of a single derogatory thing about him.

I regard him as being absolutely loyal and patriotic. He would not

affiliate with any radical or subversive activities or join in politically

extreme movements of any kind. The only activity I know he takes part

in is his activities on behalf of the abolition of capital punishment.

He is an absolutely discreet person who hould not divulge any details

of confidential matters he is handling. I hould personally recommend

him for the most sensitive possible assignment.

He is a man that I

would be happy to hire and have associated with me tomorrow.

HARRY J. RUDICK, Partner, Lord, Day and Lord, 25 Broadway, sth Floor.

I have known Professor Norman Redlich since about 1950. I am a Professor

of Law at New York University in addition to my practice here. I have

also had some casual social acquaintance with him, although I am not a

close, personal friend. I hate met his wife, Erelyn, and their children.

I believe he possesses a fine character and enjoys an excellent reputation.

He is an awfully good teacher and he writes very well. We hork together

on the Tax Law Review. I am sure that he is a good family man. He makes

a nice personal appearance and his mental and physical health are excellent.

He is not a drinking man. There is nothing unfavorable that I know about

him.

One of his great interests is in abolishing capital punishment. He is

a man that I would describe as "left of center". By that, I mean he is

something of a social reformer, but I am quite sure that he would not

do anything that is not in the

best interest of our country. I hould

not consider him to be a political extremist or a person that I would

describe as subversive or radical. I think that anybody could repose

confidence in hin never to divulge any confidential information. He has

never divulged to me any confidential information he has obtained on the

important assignment he now holds for the Government. I would not hesitate

to recommend him. He has an unisually fine mind.

I have known Norman for about 20 years. We first became friends wben

our nothers, here in New York City, who met socially, learned that we

were both in the sane hospital suffering from frost bite in our feet

while in the Military Service. We served together with the 100th

Infantry Division.

I hould say that he had a good military record. We

have continued to be friends ever since and in fact, are very close chums.

We also lived close to one another in Mt. Vernon, New York. Moreover,

I handled the insurance business for Durst Industries.

I think that Norman is one of the finest, most reputable and honest

persons I have ever met. His personal reputation is the very highest

and he is a good, family man.

He is something of a football fan.

could best describe him as a "solid citizen". I have always been delighted

to have him as a friend and to do business with him. He is a very

brilliant person concerning whom I know nothing unfavorable.

There is absolutely no question about his loyalty and patriotiam to our

country. He would never do anything that would be harmful in any way

to the interest of the United States. He is a somewhat close mouthed

person and not a bragger. I would absolutely recoumend him for any

out we do not visit back and forth at one another's hones

I regard him as a man of first rate character. I also would say he

gave up his interest in playing golf to spend more time with his wife.

He likes to spend some time sailing and skiing. He is a most person-

able individual who gets along extremely well with other people. He

is a straightforward sort of person and "his word is his bond". He is.

very devoted to the academic life and does a great deal of reading. His

a fine person concerning whom I know absolutely nothing of an unfavorable

There is absolutely no question about his loyalty and patriotism. He

is what might be called a "champion of causes". He is very interested

in activities to protect the Fifth Amendment; he is strongly opposed to

capital punishment; he is what I would call a liberal, quite interested

in civil rights.

There is no doubt in my mind that some of the causes

In which he is Interested might possibly attract other persong who are

subversive or radical in their intention or outlook.

However, this

should in no way indicate that he would have such tendencies.

He is

only in the reform type organizations for which he works because of his

idealism, and he would not do anything detrimental or harmful to the

United States Government.

If other people in any of those movements

were of a subversive or radical nature, this should not in my opinion

reflect in any way against Norman, who is a loyal, patriotic American.

He is a man who is very discreet by his legal training. He is also

mature and has good judgment.

He is a modest sort of person and would

not divulge important information in order to seem important himself.

I would give him my unhesitating recommendation for a highly sensitive

assignment. He is not a man who would attempt to undertake anything un-

less he was fully able and qualified to carry it out.

MICHAEL, LIPMAN, Vice-President, Jamaica Mamfacturing Company.

I have known Norman for about five or six years. I know that he has been

affiliated with Durst Industries for about l4 or 15 jears.

My association

with him is of a business nature only. I have had some rather casual

social contact, but I am not a personal friend.

His personal reputation is the very highest. He is a most honorable

and forthright kind of individual. Everything about his business dealings

are open and above board. His firm are both customers and competitors

of ours. I have always found him to be a man most honorable in his

business dealings.

Never have I heard or seen anything that would reflect

adversely upon him.

I am sure he is a loyal, patriotic citizen and I would not expect him

to affiliate with any subversive or radical groups. He never discusses

politics with me.

He is a very intelligent person and I would expect

him to show discretion in handling important information of a confidential

nature. I hould very highly recommend him for a sensitive assigment

with our government.
