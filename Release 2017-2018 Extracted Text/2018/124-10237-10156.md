CONFIDENTIAL

WAITVI

Mora has also advised

that Mary Louise Camacho, nee

Patterson, knew Oswald while he was in Russia.

Greater detail

from Mora on this point is extremely pertinent since CIA may

have Camacho questioned in Russia about what

She Mom mi

Oswald and his activities while there

3090

Finally, Mora has furnished

some information on

Oswald's visit to the Cuban. Embassy in Mexico City•

should determine all Mora knows about this visit and where

she obtained her information.

This matter must be pursued in depth until we have

fully explored and exhausted all of Mora's information. These

questions, which, the original information received Iron MOra

ase raised, cannot be left unanswered and MEX-18 and MEX-19

should be made fully aware of this.

Of course, in receiving

further information from Mora, care must be taken to distinguish

that information which is speculation and belief on Mora's part

from

that which is factual.

Advise immediately whether Mex-18 and Mex-19 ave

recontacted Mora for the twoor three-day period as planned.

If so, promptly furnish letterhead memorandum suitable for

dissemination.
