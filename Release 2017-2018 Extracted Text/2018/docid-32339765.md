tect) advised that a UPI newspaperwoman, ALINE MOSBY, was

found unconscious and partially disrobed in a gutter in

Moscow while she was stationed there.

She was jailed over

night at that time and the incident mentioned in "Izvestia".

MOSBY was reportedly examined at the United States Embassy,

Moscow; the following day, and it was determined she had been

drugged. The episode was considered an attempt by the Rus-

sians to place UPI at a disadvantage if at some future time

UPI should incur the displeasure of the Soviet Government.

To preclude such an eventuality, Miss MOSBY was transferred

by UPI to another post,

thus terminating her career in

MoscOW.

The above information was furnished the Bureau

by WFOlet dated 10/24/62, captioned as described above.

,,For a time ALINE MOSBY was also considered a

suspect in the case entitled "UNSUB; Approximately 30-

year-old Female American Tourist of Interest to KGB For

Possible Recruitment; IS - R"

file 105-47870. Investigation in this case disclosed

that MOSBY was rumored to have undergone an abortion

while in Moscow.!: 'A book entitled "The View From Number

13 Peoples Street"', authored by ALINE MOSBY and pub-

lished in 1962 by Random House, New York, was reviewed

by WFO on 10/17/63, at which time MOSBY was described

as being born and reared in Missoula, Montana, and grad-

uating from the University of Montana.

At the time of

the books publication, Miss MOSBY was with the Paris

Bureau of UPI.
