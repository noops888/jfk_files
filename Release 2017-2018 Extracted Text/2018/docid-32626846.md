TOP SECRET

Mac:

Attached are George Ball'a first batch of papers.

They are remarkable for their unanimity in thinking that

something atrong needs to be done. In my judgment, attach-

ments l, 6 and 7 are worth reading. The rest add little.

I have asked George Springsteen in George Ball'e

absence to see if we can get copies of the State papers promised

by the end of the day today so that the President can look at them

overnight. If, lailing this, I think he might look at the three

I mentioned plus a one or two-page summary I will put on top

of it. I will let you know further on this later faday.

3.

Do you think there is any point in talking with George

and Ros for a few minutes at 9:35 or 9:40 before the large

meeting convenes?
