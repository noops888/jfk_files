The status of informants and sources, if found through research,

is noted after the name as Living (L), Deceased (D), Date of

Birth (mm/dd/yY), or No Record (NR) .

(U) The FBI provided written justifications presenting

the evidence available to protect the individuals, singular

information,

and classified information related to sources and

toreign relations as listed above. However, the ARRB supports

the position that the information

ordered disclosed is relevant

and significant to the assassination.

They opine the pertinence

and importance to the assassination outweigh any current harm to

the individuals or the FBI's/United States Government's foreign

relations, informants or operational aspects.

(U) The JEKTE will continue to advise CID, NSD and OGC

of the ARRB decisions.

However, due to the narrowed scope of

appeal issues, NSD and CID recommendations will only be sought

for significant matters, none of which are documented in this

memorandum. If you have questions, please contact Barbara I.

Hatch at extension 9482, Carol L. Keeley at extension 9494, or

Carl Valentine at extension 9476.
