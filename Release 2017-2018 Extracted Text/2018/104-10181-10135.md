MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: * General: AMMUG/1 Debriefing Report #264

Specific: Alias

"Alias may consist of first and surname and may be

used as first name, surname, or both together. for example,

Manuel VEGA uses 'Marcos" or "Marcos Viera"; Carmen

Carrazedo uses "Mercedes" or ''Mercedes Castro"; CHAIN

uses "Augasto, " "Captain Augusto, " "Captain Chacon, "" or

"Captain Augusto Chacon." Benito uses the alias "Saul" or

"Saul P. " The "p" probably stands for PEREZ and may be

Benito's true name; when DGI colleagues teased him about

the "p" standing for PEREZ, he became angry and upset,

which led them to think it was perhaps his name.

father-in-law lived in the U.S. and in April 1964 his father

was in Spain planning to go to the U.S. as soon as he had

ia visa.
