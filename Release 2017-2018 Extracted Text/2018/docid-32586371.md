the DR had twice tried to get it. Source said on January 8, 1959,
members of the DR came to see TRAFFICANTE and asked him to open up
the dining room and cabaret section.of the Sans Souci Night Club.

through winnings from the casino. Source said that TRAFFICANTE
had been visited by about 50 people involved in gambling activities
