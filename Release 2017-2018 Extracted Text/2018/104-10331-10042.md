NOTE FOR: J. Barry Harrelson @ DA -

SUBJECT: Keenan v. U.S.Dod & CIA
Barry,

KEENAN (d.0.b. 23 Nov 1924; p.o.b. Dover, NH; Since this request is pursuant to a lawsuit under FOIA and the
Privacy Act, all that is requires search reasonably calculated to locate the responsive records. An index search-ghould be sufficient;
no hand search is necessary. ee Cate

2. KEENAN was an FBI agent who claims to have been involved with investigating Lee Harvey OSWALD's purported contact
with Cuban and Soviet agents in Mexico City. The CIA's IP&CRD office responded to Keenan that no records indexed by his name were
located, but | am unsure whether your office was tasked with the initial request.

1. Request that your office conduct a search to mall whether it has any records containing the name of Laurence P.

3. Please do not hesitate to contact me via Lotus Notes or on x76135 if { may be of further assistance. Thanks.
