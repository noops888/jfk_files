MENORALDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo KiY

RAY is crushed over the

fate of his plans to

oxport his arms to Costa Rica.

I told him our Ambassador

had received a neative reply

from the Costa Rican Govern

ment as end user about 28 November.

RAY pointed out that

this must have been the second or

even third visit paid by

our Ambassador to Costa Rican authorities on this matter

and he stated he belicves these multiple comings and goings

must have given the Costa Ricans the impression the U.S. Is

against the shipment.

* told him apparently Oduber got ou

f touch with current thinking in Costa Rica. but RAI

believes there were just too many visits on the matter.

The part about internal political considerations in Costa

Per discussion with Mr. Crimmins, I then raised

the possibility of arranging

another end user who would have

was really no point in even beginning discussions in an

informal way, if subsequently the U.S. Ambassador was going

I culd RAY I would try to got an answer to this

and hoped if I did it would stick.

RAY then wanted to knus what markings are absolutcly

minimum for the weapons and bills of salc.

I told him I"d

look into this and try to get him an answer, pointing out

to him the troubles in the present marking system. He told

me the word

"Model" does not actually appear on the scapons,

nor does the word "sera" one men win eves reings

now on the weapons without further word from us, because

no one one on know each that earine teen suate.

He does not seem to know exactly what mirkings are

how many pieces of equipment,

but he thinks at least some

on a couple

of weeks ago. I am surprised at his

vagueness on this point.

RAY finally asked the following questions designed

to shed light on just how confidential the export of arms

is kept in the U.S.:

How confidential is the export permit?

Who has to

know about it?

Is it ever publicized?

Does It have

to be publicized?

What security rules goern this

matter with respect to other U.S. agencies involved,

indicated my beller

that when several departments in at least

two governments are involved, secrecy cannot well be guaran-

teed, especially when the arms firm involved (Erquiaga) has

been having some legal troubles and is being watched.

RAY still thinks it would be better not to have

the correct serial numbers show on the B/L and asked it

there would not be some way to control just one inspector

who would merely check the amounts, not the markingsg

hY would sive us an honest run-out of the

I told lum there was no possibillty of running an

operation against nother U.S. Government agency.

The conversation was so unsatisfartory that I did not

raise the limitations

posed by Mi. Crimmins

on RAY's radio
