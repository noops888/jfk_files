MEMORANDUM: Chief, Task Force W

SUBJECT : British Press Speculation that DRE Raiders may
have used British Territory as a Base

REFERENCE : DIR 82616 (OUT 70518)

This memorandum is for your information only, and
does not recommend action. Bits and pieces of infor-
mation have suddenly and recently appeared concerning
Cuban exile activity in the Bahamas, and of equally
_ sudden and recent probes by non-Cuban Bahamian resi-
dents, which may or may not mean something. I also
continue to be somewhat puzzled, as mentioned below,
by the unusual attitude of |Chief, Special Branch, > o
Bahamian Polica with esa the. Anguila Island query.:

1, In response to a recent request from the London Station for
guidance in the event it is queric: |concerning the DRE raid on f
Cuba, mainly resulting from Brit eculation that the raiders may
have used.a secret’ base in the Bahamas, the Station was informed that the
DRE, ina press conference of 25 August, said that the boats had sailed from
Marathon in the Florida keys, and that British territory apparently was not
involved, Also that the raid was launched without our knowledge or support,

2. In addition, on 27 August 1962, the FBI informed Mr. Wallen that
it had received an inquiry by way of its Miami field office from Mr. (Gregg 06 0%
a | Special Branch in thé _Bahamas}~ concerning his recent
investigation of a number of Cubain exiles on the island of Anguila who allegedly
told him they were there ona CIA mission, Mr. (Bentley)claimed to be concerned )6
because he would of course have to report the matter [hrou; e Colonial>24
Office}: but would very much dislike having to do this if it tually a CIA
operation. Mr, Wallen suggested that the Bureau might inform Mr. Bentley}. 06

that the activity was definitely not Agency sponsored, but that we might get
in touch with him at some point aout In this and similar problems, 249

C/TFW, in being informed of this report, stated that he also had recently re-
ceived the same query from the jin Washington, D, C. seq
and had also-denied any Agency involvement. ie above was brought to London

Station's attention with the comment that because of coincidence and logical

: placement Anguila conceivably could have been used by the raiders a¢ a staging

area and base. SECRET / G— 124%~ AG :

3. It has since come to our attention that maritime operation PARROT
mounted by WAVE on 22 August involved a scheduled rendezvous on ‘Atiguila
key |between a WAVE asset and.two UR internal officials, ‘The operation
was unsuccessful in that'the two UR officials failed to make thé rendezvous
as scheduled. WAVE is now planning to rerun the operation on 30/31 August.

4, The above is being brought to your attention since our knowledge
of the use of Anguila as 2 rendezvous point may possibly cause some future
embarrassment if the{BritiShjshould learn of it and mistakenly associate
it with the activities e exile group. investigated by. Mr. (Bentley| ~

5, Another development, at least peripherally involving os Bahamas,
is described below: :

a. The U. S. Coast Guard on 21 August 1962 inquired as
to any interest we might have in one W. Carney, who, in turn,
is interested in obtaining rights on the Island of Navassa,
Navassa was described as lying-thirty miles due west of the
westernmost tip of Haiti, and is under Coast Guard adminis-
tration. According to TFW/PM we have looked into the island
and found it uninhabited---and possibly uninhabitable---with
no water or harbor facilities. CI/Liaison, at our instruction,
has informed the Coast Guard that we are not sponsoring Carney,
but probably had no objection, and would like more details.

b, Carney describes himself as a retired marine engineer,
who owns property in the Bahamas, and who takes out private
fishing parties, He wants to.usé Navassa as a private fishing
resort, a refueling station, and a watering point, The Coast
Guard has apparently reminded him that there is no water and
no harborage on Navassa, but he is still interested,

c. The Coast Guard has an unmznned radio station on the
island. For some legal reasons they cannot sell, or-even Jease,
property on the island, but they could give Carney a five year
revocable permit, maintaining the right to inspect and approve
any construction,

d. The Coast Guard {s contimaing to check into Carney, and
will probably give him the permission he Is seeking if they find
nothing derogatory on him., Although Carney is a permanent
resident of the Bahamas, he also has a New York address which

4 ‘was given as 655 Pelham Parkway, North, Bronx 67, New York.

6. .In addition, an Agency contact, a resident of the Bahamas, who.
_ travels extensively throughout the islands, recently reported that he had
personally obsérved during a trip through the southern keys that several
of thé keys which‘previously were uninhabited were now occupied by a.
number of Cuban exiles. According to source, the\British authorities) ||
apparently are puzzled as to their presence there ‘as to what to do
about it, =.

7. Much of the above indicates that a number of Cuban exiles are |;
showing up in remote areas of the Bahamas, and the tish\are no. doubt
concerned over their presence and possible CIA involvement. Mr. (Senags~
query concerning the 0 of exiles he allegedly investigated on Anguila 06

\\. Island.emphasizes It-also-sounds somewhat provocative

Qb.in that Mf, (Bentley[claims t thought it prudent, after having been

told he an unhaméd Cuhan exile leader that thev were there.on a CIA mission,
