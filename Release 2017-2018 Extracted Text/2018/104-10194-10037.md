“During this period I recall a number of activities
undertaken for the Station, and I travelled to New York for
clandestine training. The file indicates "Ne was originally
approved operationally to handle the complex Soviet espionage
caso OF LFULMTINATER:2. Mis. conduct of this case was considered
excellentO%.* Also, *It will be recalled that Ieadquarters
was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done.'
The latter was indicative of a nunber of such chores, when I
stayed behind in my plant after the, employees had left for
the night, printing leaflets, booklets, etc. I also handlod
agents and did a number of spotting and assessing jobs for

the Station.

"I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for
$500.00 per month which ran until the termination date of
31 August 1953, (Actually this was in the form of a loan
which was paid off at the rato of $500,00.. The advance was
used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do
certain work foughe Station, but which I retained.)

i rmination of the contract on 31 August I
remained in| i until 4 March 1954. During this poriod I

recruited a agent who still works for the Station--and
was a cabine ember under! On 3 February 1954
Headquarters asked that I be made available for another
assignment. The Station pointed out that I was working on
the recruitment, and that I and my family were planning on

a European vacation. Headquarters again requested my assign-
ment. Thus I departed for the Guatemala project in early
March, abandoning my free family trip to Europe (tickets
paid for by advertising in my papor} and leaving my family
bshind to pack up. I accepted this assignment without knowing
where it was, or for how long it would last. Indeed I did

not even have a contract.

"IT worked for the Agency in| then, between

1 August 1950 until departure for PRSUCCESS on 4 'farch 1954,

8. The following information is supplied by Mr, Phillips
concerning his Cuban assignment:

"In the summer of 1958 I resigned from the Agency with
the intention of opening a public relations firm in Havana,
Cuba. In discussing this the then-Chief, then-Wi Division,
Col. King asked ne if I would work for the Agency in Cuba.
Understanding that this referred to part-time work which would
allow me to pursue my own endeavor, I agreed and a contract
was drawn up and made effective 15 August 1958, This was in
Washington. The Station in Havana was advised on 11 August
prior to my departure on 13 August,

"After settling in and renting an office in Havana I
was asked if I would travel on full-time Agency work.

i “Fidel Castro toppled Batista the last night of

' 1958, From that time I was devoting most of my time to the
Agency. I ran, from my office, a country-wide press service.
I handled several agents. In the summer of 1959 I was
instructed by the Station to attend a meeting with a group
of Cubans plotting against Fidel Castro. (See Memorandum ]
for the Record of 6 August 1959.) The last sentence of my H
report on this neoting read: ‘With the new death penalty

i in Cuba for anti-revolution activity, it is not hard to

Fe imagine that at least one member of this group might inform
e to the government.' That was prophetic. The Cubans in the
meeting, with two exceptions, went to jail where several of
them remain to this day. There was some indication that
the meeting might have deen bugged. I was advised of this
while in the U. S. (still working on the television project)
and the Station suggested there might be danger in my
returning to Havana. I elected to return.

"By this time (late summer of 1959) Fidel Castro
had eliminated "public relations'. I had no clients, and no
prospect of obtaining them. Despite this I stayed in Havana i
until March of 1960 doing nothing but Agency work. When I
E did return it was acknowledged that I would be coming back

to staff status (my contract was amended again while I was
: still in Havana to pay for shipment of furniture). Immediately

on arriving in the Washington area I began to work as a staffer

on the Bay of Pigs operation. i

“In summary: Despite intent on my part to have a
private business, I began working for the Agency when I arrived.
in Havana, often in TDY status which was full-time Agency work,

I never obtained a major client for mv public relations firm,

I was always on call and working on instructions from the
Station until recalled for the Headquarters assignment. There
was some risk in much of what I was tasked to do by the Station.”



9. Your determination is requested as to whether
the period from August 1950 until 3 March 1954 and again
for the period 19 August 1958 until 13 March 1960 can be
considered as creditable service for retirement purposes

for Mr. Phillips.
