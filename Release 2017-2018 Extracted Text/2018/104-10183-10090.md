3. Prelit: Aral As pointed out in a preliminary
analysis of the LAS complex, made in Karch 19€5 when I was
preparing for travel {ee fa
case: “...There 1s no COnVineing evicence that the yroup is
working either for or against the regi:e of Fidel CASTRO.
Reports op their contacts with us and their discussions among
themselves are at variance. {[n 1962 ¥.del CASTRO, reportedly
knowing that they were plotting sgainst him, talked to ARLASII-1
and seven members of his group tv enlist their support against
Anibal ESCALANTE Dellunde and the communists in Cuba. Possibly
they gre playing both cnods ayasnst the middle. Thay certainly
have been and are in contact witn the two ends.” The following
comments are keyed to matters raiscd by ESPINOSA:

The AMLASE ¢ Bey = As detailed b 3716
aN 2asaay” on 6 April 1965, USPOKT-1 reporting on tog

of the AMLASH group, ine 1ud tng AMAHIP- 1 mentioned the following
significant points:

(1) KUBARK was criticized for “fooling around for
years" without helping and for jeopardizing thy operation;

(2) the group was to be prepared to denounce
ODYORK as responsible if the operation fails and believed that
the resulting scandal would wake the Bay of Pige seem tnsigni-

ficant; and

(3) AMLASH-3 was in touch with Ciban Intelligence
as established by soape messaces vhich he cxhidited.

seetings with LSPINOSA, the problem eecn by Par.s ia that

in connection with the/Qiiors-1 |{~)



“the AMLASH circle ia side and each new friend of whom xc learn
scuns to have knowledge of the plan.” ! believe that the
problem is a more scrious and basic one. As indtcated in
paragraph 3° of the present memorandum, F.del CASTRO himself
-‘weportedly.:kncw as far back as ‘1962 that the group was plotting
against him and, knowing it, enlisted its support. Hence ve
eaiinot rule out the possibility of provocation. Agsassination, :
obviously, is a dangerois yam, not serely to the plotters, ia
& physical sense, but to a sponsoring government which may. #
suffer severe political repercussions at home and abroad if ats
involvezent is made known, In the instant case, the risks of
exposure of the ODYOKE hand would appear high, whether there is
& provocation or not. Considering the individuals who are
involved directly, their contacts with KUBARK officers,and their .
reported plan to expose ODYOKL, pervistinig in the: plan could
be highly embarrassing te KUBARA. (This is even more the ‘case {
now that ESPINOSA has talked to ODEXVY and OQDURGE, althodgh i
