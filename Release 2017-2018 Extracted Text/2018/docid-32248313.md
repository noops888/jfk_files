Page two interview of Joseph Cambre

Mr. Cambre believes that Mary Banister mentioned that she

had allowed the F.B.I. to take what they, wanted from the

files before the State Police obtained them.

This seemed

appropiate since Mr. Banister was a retired

F.B.I. Agent.

Mr. Cambre couldn't remember the names of the files but he

remembered that they were of organizations and individuals

that would be considered liberal, or subversive, or communist.

Mr. Banister had extensive records on the Southern Conference

Educational Fund.

Many of the files were newspaper clippings.

that refered to something that Banister was interested in.

Mr. Cambre remembers reading a file on the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee which was mostly news clippings.

He also

remembers a transcrip of Lee Harvey Oswald speaking to some-

had an address on Camp st..

544 Camp St. was the same. building that Mr. Banister had his

•vas ta pane buildine

He was surprised to learn that

office in.+ He couldn't anything else about the contents of

the files at this time but will call back if he thinks of

anything new that might be of use.

Mr. Cambre stated that an investigator from Jim Garrison's

office came and took notes of the contents of the files and

index cards.

He could not remember the name of the investi-

gator but suggested that Garrison might remember.

The files were loaded into cartoon and bags in his pre-

sence but he die not see them destroyed.. He suggested that

Ray W. Thomas or Billy Joe Booth might know more about the

actual destroying of the files.

Mr. Thomas works with a

private detective agency in Baton Rouge and Mr. Booth is an

instructor at the Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.
