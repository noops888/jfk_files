PRIORITY

10

SIL

1. IN PROCESSION OF ARBITRARY MEASURES SINCE CLOTURE OF SPECIAL

E

SESSION OF PARLIAMENT, ARREST OF LABOR LEADERS AND TENDENCY OF

AIDA

COMMISSIONERS TO SHUNT ADOULA ASIDE, ARE MOST DISTRUBING. GOVT

P

DOMINATED BY ANANY WOULD MAKE SHORT WORK OF NON ALIGNMENT POLICY..

IOP

WOULD BE VIGOROUS, DECISIVE AND WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS US • ON

INR: OTHER HAND, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE OBSCURANTIST, ARBITRARY,

0

PRIMITIVE, TOTALITARIAN, WILFUL AND IRRENPCH. EXCEPT FOR BOMBOKO,

RMR

ITS MEMBERS WOULD GENERALLY FAIL TO GRASP THE DECISIVE CHARACTER

OF FOREIGN AID AND OPINION IN EVOLUTION OF CONGO• THERE WOULD

SEEM TO BE NO ONE IN IT CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH F/X CONTROL,

MONETARY REFORM OR THE BUDGET.

2. THE ARREST OF LABOR LEADERS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN AN UNNECESSARY

AND DAMAGING BUSINESS WHICH, HOWEVER. IS NOT AS SHOCKING IN CONGO

AS IT MAY PROVE ABROAD. I BELIEVE I HAVE NOW PROTESTED IT ABOUT AS

ENERGENTICALLY AS I CAN WITHOUT FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS •

3º AS TO ADOULAS POSITION I TOLD ANANY IN EFFECT, THAT HE WAS

NOT SMART ENOUGH TO DO WITHOUT ADOULA BUT I, DO NOT THINK HE

UNDERSTOOD. WHAT I WAS SAYING: BOMBOKO DENIES CATEGORICALLY ANY

INTENTION OF COMMISSIONERS TO CUT AWAY FROM ADOULA. WHEN I CITED

COMMISSIONS ACTION ON COMMUNIST EMBASIES QUESTION AS USURPING

GOVT PEROGATIVES, BOMBOKO CLAIMED THAT ADOULA WOULD MAKE THE

DECISION. I BELIEVE BOMBOKO AND AMANY DESPITE THEIR IRRITATIONS ..

WITH ADOULA STILL CONSIDER HIM NECESSARY TO THEIR CAUSE.

COMTSSIONERS GONE COULO BECOME SO ARISE TRARY THAT A BULANOU

CONEIDENTIAL

REPROSUCORF FROM THiS COPY IS

• PROHIBITED UNLESS "UNCLASSIFIED"

-2-925, OCTOBER 25, 7 PM, FROM LEOPOLDVILLE

CHOOSE TO DISSASSOCIATE HIMSELF FROM IT. WE KEEPING EYE ON THIS

POSSIBILITY BUT IN CONGO OMCE A MAN IS EXCLUDED,. HE IS GENERALLY

OUT FOR KEEPS, E.G. EXILE OR PRISON.

5. ALTHOUGH BOMBOKd'S (I SAW HIM THIS AFTERMOON) ATTITUDE MUCH

MORE REASSURING THAN ANANY'S AND WHILE LATTERS INTENTIONS SEEM

TO PROCEED FROM NAIVETE RATHER THAN BAD INTENTION THERE IS SUFFI-

CIENT CAUSE FOR DIQUIET TO WARRANT OUR CONTEMPLATING APPLICATION

OF GRADUATING SCALE OF PRESSURES• THUS FAR I HAVE:

A • EXPRESSED TO ADOULA AND MEMBERS OF TRIUMVIRATE MISGIVINGS

ON LABOR LEADERS AREST AND BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME CHANCE OF SECURING

THEIR RELEASE •

B. CIRCULATED TO ABOVE CLIPPING ON ATTITUDES OF SENATE COMMITTEE ON

FOREIGN RELATIONS SHOWING INVERSE RELATION BETWEEN FOREIGN AID

AND DICTATORIAL ACTS.

C. MADE CLEAR TO THEM DANGERS OF COMMISSIONS USURPING ROLE OF GOVT

HINTED THAT SPECIAL AID TO GOC MIGHT BE JEOPARDIZED.

6: NEXT SCALE OF ASCENDING PRESSURES AS REQUIRED, MIGHT BE:

A. DEFERRING OR CANCELLING VISIT SUCH AS PROPOSED UAW MISSION.

SPAKKS VISIT: RENS TRIP, ETC. (PROVIDED BELGIANS AGREE) .

B. : NUMEROUS KINDS OF LEVERAGE CAS AND DEPT CAN APPLY ALSO IN

SLIDING SCALE (INCLUDING STATEMENTS OF DISAPPROBATION ON GRADUATED

SCALE SUCH AS LEADS, INSPIRED ARTICL, AND FINAL STATE DEPT.

SPOKESMAN ETC.

C• HOLDING UP MOBUTU AIRCRAFT.

D. FOOT DRAGGING ON REPLIES TO ADOULAS REQUEST TO NEGOTIATE NEW

PL 480 AGREEMENT •

E. FURTHER HOLD UP OF RELEASE OF COUNTERPART FOR PUBLIC WORKS.

F• CONTINUED

-3-925, OCTOBER 25, 7 PM, FROM LEPOLDVILLE

FO CONTINUED DEFERRAL OF ALLOCATIONS BE UNPROGRAMMED US AID•

G• CLEAR INDICATION OF PREFERENCE FOR OTHER POLITICAL FIGURES,

E-Ga KALONUT.

HO RECALL OF US AMB ON CONSULTATION

(HE HAS HOME LEAVE COMING)

AND FINALLY,

1= ACTUAL OVERT SUSPENSION OF AID AND/OR RELATIONS:

7. OBVIOUSLY SOMEHWERE ALONG ABOVE SCALE WE REACH POINT WHERE

WE MUST CONSIDER WHETHER WE CUTTING OFF NOSE TO SPITE FACE•

8. HALTING OF FOOD SHIPMENTS FOR EXAMPLE, COULD ONLY PRECIPITATE

SOCIAL UNREST AND ENTRY OF COMMUNIST INFLUENCE BY THAT GATE:

EXCESSIVELY ARBITRARY ACTIONS BY AUTOCRATIC GOVT COULD HAVE SAME

EFFECT BUT PROBABLY CONSTDERABLE LATER IN TIME LEAVING PERIOD

FOR PROMOTION OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND REFORM AND RE EDUCATION OF

GOVT •

WOULD APPRECIATE DEPT'S THINKING.
