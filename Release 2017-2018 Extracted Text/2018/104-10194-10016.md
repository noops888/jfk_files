EVALUATION AND BACAGROUIO DATA (IncludE

education and tora experienco)

Mise Tarasoff is the wife of Boris Tarasoff, FDIll employees She first made application

shortly after her husband's EOD while she and the children were

still in California.

Attempts to have her te: ted

and Interviewed on the West Coast were unsuccessful.

The farily is all now gattered in D.C.; the children are in school; arra gements

have be:a nade for the care of

the

children during the lage between the end of

the school day and the end of the parents wort: daye

Test results are very interestine. It would appear that Mrs. Tarasoff shoudd be

áble to do a most adequate job in a clerical job of the most deadly reutine nature.

I'm quite sure such positions are avallable in the Agency.

Mri. Tarasoff apparently has a reasonably good connand of Russian, both spaken and

written; I gathered that some of the houselield conversation 1a carried or in that

langiage.

HOWEVER, I gave her absolutely no assurance that we would be able to

utilize this skill.

She is interested in employnent as soon as possible and I discussed an Indices

Cleararce with hers

The Pool, the temporary indefinito appointient, et al, were

• deseribed in lurid detail. She is wiiling and interested.

Personally, I found Nrs. Taragoff to be a very pleasant little wonan. She is slight

and slender with reddish hair; sniles easily and appears as easy to work with,

GS l Clerk agreeable and recommended.

CENTRAL. INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

WASHINGTON 25. D. Co

Applicant Information

Sheet No, 1

To all persuns applying for employment

with the Ceatral Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant

status with the Central Intelligence Agency.

No application may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the

conditions stated below:

General Considerations:

1. The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

a, "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies

as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

ments and agencies" of the Government as relate to the national

security:

c.. "So correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the

national security,

and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within

the Governmens...:

d. "so perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence

agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National

Security Courcil determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally:

e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to

intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security

Council may irom time to time direct."

---

## Page 7

The special characher of this national responsibility requires the Agency

to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which may be

different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern-

ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive reg

ponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows thut the

investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a time-

consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks,

includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, und

availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered.

This is called "clearance" of an applicant.

2. Investigation of in applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicint is genuinely unware,

perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency

make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency ire con-

clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no stilement of

specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon

which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full

clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving in

unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance

of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,

taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants

are not cleared.

Statement of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid

erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

Although this employee's mort is productive, her rate of production generally remains

at a fixed level, with no substantial inerease or decrease.

This 18 probably due to

the fact that there are no other stria with whom she can compete because of other

duties being assigned to then, or this employee may be of a non-competitive type.

This employee, although she does not meet the Agency qualifications In typing, has

taken the Agency's Refresher Courge In Typing.

However, this course was too

advanced for her and she vill probably require additional training and more practice
