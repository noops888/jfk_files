CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY ieee
fF WASHINGTON 25, D.C, :

Applicant Information
Sheet No. 1 .

To all persons applying for employment
with the Ceatral Intelligence Agency:
7
This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant
status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed
beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the

conditions stated below:

General Consideration:
ah eerations

1. The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th :
Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the
Agency the responsibility: |

a. Mto advise the National Security Council in matters concerning
Such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies
as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council
for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-
ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national
Security;

¢. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the
national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination
of such intelligence within the Government... ;

d, "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence
agencies, such additional services of common Concern as the National |

Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished
centrally; i

"to perform such other functions and duties related to '
intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security
Council may from time to time direct

4 7) i



cis clearance - perhaps

f this national responsibility requires the Agency e
gly special employment criteria which may be '
different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern-
ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res~
ponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the
investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a time- =
consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks, !
includes evaluation of competence, ghysical and emotional fitness, and |
availability of'a’suitable position at such time as employment may be offered.

‘This is called "clearance" of an applicant, !

The special character of
to maintain correspondin:

icant may reveal something which prevents
‘something of which the applicant is genuinely unawares
thing which only the special employment criteria of the Agency
In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are cons

‘a3 the Agency is concerned, and no statement of }
applicant.”

2. Investigation of an appl

perhaps some!
make unacceptable.
_clusive and final so far
specific reasons is made to the

3, Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon

which an applicant can insist, Offer of employment which is subject to full
clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an
Snouecesstul applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance
of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,
taken with the knowledge that very substantial percentage of applicants

are not cleared.
Statement of Understanding
and Agreement

[have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Gonsid-!

erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, Iwill make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations.
