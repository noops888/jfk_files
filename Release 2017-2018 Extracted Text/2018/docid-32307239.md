During the summer of 1953, ROTHMAN advised on sevéral different
occasions that he and the Sans Souci were in bad shape financially and he
did not know at that time whether he would be able to continue operations. $0)

economically was borne out by POI DINO CELLINI, FBI No. 2198122, American
floor man at the Tropicana night club, who in September, 1953, advised

The fact that ROTHMAN and the Sans Souci were in bad shape \
that he was trying to work out a deal to take over the Sans Souci. It is .

tions between NORMAN ROTHMAN of the Sans Souci and
MARTIN FOX, ARDURA or ECHEMENDIA of the Tropicana.
There is never lacking a suspicion that they might be
speaking of unification, of interchanges, of manage-
ment, etc.” x

Efforts will be made to ascertain through CELLINI and ROTHMAN fae
whether the Tropicana is taking over the operation of the Sans Soucek (MQ),

Ite HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ of the Cuban Bureau of Investigations exhibited
