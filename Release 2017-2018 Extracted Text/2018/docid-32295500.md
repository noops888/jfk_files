Snack's Restaurant. The girl had worked in a downtown
restaurant in Milwaukee owned by BECK and was employed
without knowledge of the fact that she was working at this
time at Snack's. PROVINZANO telephoned BECK, gave him one
half hour to fire the girl, or said he better watch himself.
BECK refused to fire the girl, but the incident illustrated
to him the hoodlum attitude on the part of PROVINZANO.
