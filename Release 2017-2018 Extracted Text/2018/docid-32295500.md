Snack's Restaurant.

The girl had worked in a downtown

restaurant in Milwaukee owned by BECK and was

employed

without knowledge of the fact that she was working at this

time at Snack's. PROVINZANO telephoned BECK, gave him one

half hour to fire the girl, or said he better watch himself.

BECK refused to fire the girl, but the incident illustrated

to him the hoodlum attitude on the part of PROVINZANO.
