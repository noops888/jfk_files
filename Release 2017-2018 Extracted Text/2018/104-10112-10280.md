sister of Subject's wife, Gladys.

At one time during World Var It,

as a casbier and bartender until Subject returned to Panama to mariy

her in 1945. In 1944, Army Intelligence ran an extensive investigation

on her after it was alleged that she was sympathetic to Germany and tas

attempting to elicit information from servicemen across the bar. The

allegation was proven baseless although it was developed that she could

speak and understand German, thought German men would make fine iusbandg

of a several months during 1944-1945 Subject's wife and a younger sistar

by Subject and his wife in suburban San dose, Costa Rica. Mario had

been a staunch supporter of the Calderon party in power in Costa Rico,

1944-1948 which comprised a coAlition of liberals, socialists and

Comunists. At the time of the 1947-1948 Revolution in Costa Rica,

horever, Mario fought with the Communist forces. In June 1959, the

Agency was considering the possibility of recruiting lario.

The field

reported in August 1959 that Mario is being regularly visited by Cormnists

who leave printed propaganda with him. In its August 1959 report, the

field reported that a third brother-in-law, Azdruval is currently employed

Subject is eligible for staff employment or contract Type A employment.

It is conceivable, however, that Subject could be utilized as an inde

pendent contractor with access to information classified through SECRET,

provided his future usefulness to WH Division would not be nullified by

an overt association with this Agency. It is recommended that it Division
