•the request of MEROLA, made to Departmental Attorneys

WILLIAM KENNY and WILLIAM KEHOE.

alone with MEROLA, after which SAS PORTELLA and FORSYTH

were called into KENNY's office, Room 201, Federal Bullding,

Miami.

Before the beginning of

the interview, DJ KENNY

advised SAS PORTELLA and FORSYTH that MEROLA had set the

conditions that the

Departmental Attorneys be present;

that he would never testify to any information furnished;

that he requested his identity be protected so that none

of

his information ever could be traced back to him;and that

he would not discuss any matter in which he had been a

participant.

After the interview had progressed for some time, MEROLA

relented and told of several matters in which he had

participated.

On 8/15/61, the interview

was resumed under the same con-

ditions.

At its conclusion, MEROLA advised SAS PORTELLA

and FORSYTH that he intended to be in Pittsburgh, Pa., on

8/24/61, one day before the time he 1s scheduled to surrender

to the U. S. Marshal, Pittsburgh, to commence service of his

five year sentence in connection

KENNY and WILIIAM KEHOE, who were there at the insistence

Of MEROLA. At the outset, MEROLA stated he would never testify

furnished, and he desired his

identity be protected. MEROLA advised as follows:

A. PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

Name Change

No information has ever been received why the MANNARINO family

name was legally changed from RUGGIERO tO MANNARINO.

Marriage of GABRIEL MANNARINO

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO's wife, JEAN, had no choice in her

selection of mate.

The marriage was arranged between her

father, FRANK AMATO, of Braddock, Pa., and KELLY MANNARINO.

JOSEPH PETER MANNARINO, aka, JOJO - Brother

from severe stammering, is a "nut" and

checks, and is forced to leave town.

good the amount of the worthless checks written

by JOJO.

member of the "outfit," by birth or by being "made.". Whether

one is born into eligibility for admission into the "outfit"

x or one is made eligible, the only way one can become finally

accepted is by the commission of a murder.

Every man who is

considered a

"don" without exception, has at some time or

another killed someone.

Once a man becomes a

"don," the only

way he can cease being such and can leave the

"outfit" is by

his death. The expression is used that "the door opens only

one way."

In approximately the middle 1950's, KELLY MANNARINO took a

great liking to JOSEPH MEROLA and on several occasions told

friends that he "was making" MEROLA into a "don."

On one

occasion, KELLY MANNARINO tOOk MEROLA to New York City with

him where he introduced MEROLA tO VITO GENOVESE and MIKE

MIRANDA don which time KEttY told them he was making MEROIA

on another occasion, KELLY MANNARINO gave

MEROLA a package and told him to deliver it to New York City

without opening it, and when JOE MEROLA had delivered the

package in New York City and it was opened, it was found to

contain only cut up newspaper.

MEROLA was

put to other tests,

such as arrests by the New Kensington, Pa., Police Department

all of which were designed to test him to

see if he could be

trusted and would remain silent.

Because of this experience

with KELLY MANNARINO, MEROLA became aware that all of

the top

leaders, both Nationaly and locally, of racketeering ae of

Italian

extraction and are known to each other as

"dons."

Some of the "dons" in the Pittsburgh,, Pa., area are:

NORMAN ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOs in their Cuban

other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, and when the

MANNARINOs have lost money in an investment, such as the Sans

JOHN. CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard and most

trusted lieutenant. KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his

protege and made him a "don."

After FONTANA's marriage about

a year and a half ago, he and MANNARINO had a falling out.

FONTANA thought that he was not getting enough money and

complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all

he was going to get.

FONTANA then made the serious mistake

of

going over KELY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN

LA ROCCA, who subsequently reported this to KELLY MANNARINO.

Since then FONTANA has been relegated to an unimportant job

fronting the Marbet Heating Company store in New Kensington,

and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO ganding

activities.

Gun-running

Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it,

there is no question that SAMUEL MANNARINO was part of the

conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to

Cuba.

Originally the plans to take guns to Cuba were JOSEPH MEROLA'S

plans and the guns were scheduled to go to FIDEL CASTRO.

the summer of 1958, AL ROSS told MEROLA that he could obtain

M-1 rifles and carbines.

MEROLA met ROSS at the Warwick Hotel,

New York City, and gave

RoSs $4,000 as part payment for the

guns, which money MEROLA had received from CARLOS PRIO

MEROLA was to return to the Warwick Hotel with additional

money in a day or, so and did so, but AL Ross dia not show up.

After MEROLA returned to Miami, Florida, MEROLA Learned Irom

Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO, Miami Springs, Florida, that SAM MANNARINO

was interested in purchasing an Apache airplane. Because

MEROLA is a pilot and acquainted wish airplanes, he looked

over the prospective plane with Dr. LOUIS PESSOLANO and

advised Dr. PESSOLANO that the airplane was too defective.

After that, MEROLA assisted Dr. PESSOLANO to lease a Twin

Beech airplane from a company owned by HAL DUPONt, MiamI,

Florida.

When Dr. PESSOLANO told MEROLA that MANNARINO intended

to use the airplane to fly guns to cuban dictator BATISTA, he

realized that these were the guns that had been promised to

him and that he was being double-crossed.

MEROLA then abranged

with Dr. PESSOLANO for MEROLA to accompany the pilot, STUART

SUTOR,

on the first flight to Pittsburgh, for the sole purpose

of contacting SAM MANNARINO and asking him about the double-.

cross. After SUTOR and MEROLA landed at Allegeny Airport,

Pittsburgh, they took a cab to MEROLA's sister's house in the

Regent Square section of Pittsburgh and borrowed her car.

They drove to the Tour-Tel Motel on U. S. Route 22, Monröeville,

where they registered for the night.

MEROLA and SUTOR then

traveled to New Kensington, where MEROLA attempted to locate

SAM MANNARINO.

MEROLA WaS

unable to locate SAM MANNARINO, SO

he went to Wilmerding, Pa., to the house of "Sarge" BOTTI,

where KELLY MANNARINO was hiding from the service of subpoenas.

KELLY MANNARINO stated that he knew nothing of the plan to

smuggle guns to cuba, that this was one of SAM ¿ MANNARINO'S

"hare-brained" schemes, and that he wanted nothing to do with

it.

MEROLA then returned to Miami, Florida, by way of fasterr

Airlines.

stopped with the second load of guns, resulting in consider-

able newspaper publicity, that MEROLA realized that the

weapons had been stolen from a National Guard Armory in

Canton, Ohio.

MEROLA later learned from a source he could not

recall that the burglary of the armory was committed by

GEORGE FLOREA and RICHARD STEWART, with help from a "inside

man," and that the guns had been stored in the beer distribu-

torship owned by VIC CARLUCCI in Arnold, Pa.

RED GIORDANO,

who was convicted in this case merely because it was proven

he. had bought some burlap bags and the weapons, when found,

had been wrapped in burlap bags, actually had nothing to do

with the case.

ANDY MANGINI, who was never brought into the

case, actually helped load and unload the guns from CARLUCCI's

beer

distributorship to the truck and from the truck to the

airplane.

Lottery

HYMEN MARTIN, aka, PITESBURGH HYMIE, used to have the distributor-

ship in Western Pennsylvania of the

tickets, and since he was friendly with the MANNARINOs, they

allowed his ticket to be sold at their numbers outlets in and

near New Kensington, Pa. HYMIE MARTIN, with whom MEROLA became

friendly when MEROLA was a used car salesman in Pittsburgh, pa.,

was the one who first introduced MEROLA to the MANNARINOs, in

approximately 1954. MARTIN, who now resides in Miami, Florida,

probably turned over the distributorship of the Empire Treasury

lottery ticket to his brother, NATE MARTIN, who is still in

the Pittsburgh area.

Recently, "the outfit" has come out with the Pan American

Sweepstakes ticket, which is based on the running of the Dixie

Handicap horse race at Pimlico Track, Maryland, In the near

future.:

"The outfit" compelled KELLY MANNARINO to take 10,000

books of these sweepstakes tickets, which he must dispose

of in his area of Western Pennsylvania.

One of KELLY MANNARINO'S

employees, known as

undoubtedly will handle the

deitvery of the sweepstakes tickets, as he currently does with

the Empire Treasury

lottery tickets.

Gambling Casino

The MANNARINO gambling casino in New Kensington, Pa., operates

seven nights a week.

They are well patronized at this Joint,

and they even send "luggers" to the Squirrel Hill section of

transported from that section to New Kensington for the pur-

pose of gambling. Routine employees at the gambling casino

receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the

$150 weekly salary plus a small percentage of the net take.

It has been curious in the past to note that whenever they

SO

desire, KELLY MANNARINO OF SAM MANNARINO would walk into the

gambling casino and démand that the cashier give them a sum

of money.

For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier

to give him $1,000 and not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the

risk of being killed. Employees at the casino do not carry

weapons generally, but on occasions, when there is a rumor that

the casino may be robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOS,

goes about town fully armed.

Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to traffic

in narcotics or to operate prostitution.

Hideouts

During the long period of time, in excess of one year, that

KELLY MANNARINO was hiding to avoid service of subpoenas,

commencing in December of 1957, he stayed at two places:

the house of "SARGE" BOTTI, in

Wilmerding, Pa., and the house

Of FRANK D. "SONNY" AMATO, the brother-In-law of KELLY

MANNARINO, who residesar in East McKeesport, Pa.

During the period in 1958 when SAM MANNARINO was avoiding

service of subpoena, he stayed, at least part of the time,

at the parish house of Mount Saint Peters Roman Catholic

Church, New Kensington, Pa.

F.

POLICE PROTECTION AND POLITICAL TIES

New

Kensington, Pa., Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and the majority

of his City Council

have been "owned" by the MANNARINOs, since

their election approximately eight years agò.

JOE MEROLA, at the instructions of kELlY MANWARINO, "wIred

the New Kensington City Council chambers, so that tape

recordings of the proceedings could be made.

Pittsburgh,

which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are

transported from that section to New Kensington for the pur-

pose of gambling.

Routine employees at the gambling casino

receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the

$150 weekly salary plus a small percentage of the net take.

It has been curious in the past to note that whenever they

desire, KELLY MANNARINO Or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the

gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum

of money.

For instance, SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier

to give him $1,000 and

not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the

risk of being killed. Employees at the casino do not carry

weapons generally, but on occasions, when there 1s a rumor that

the casino may be robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOs,

goes about town fully armed.

Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to traffic

In narcotics or to operate prostitution.

During the period in 1958 when SAM MANNARINO was avoiding
