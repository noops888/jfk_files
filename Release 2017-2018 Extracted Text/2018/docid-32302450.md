the means of production and distribution has resulted in a shortage of food and

According to the first of these sources, the items which comprise the -)
basis of the Cuban daily diet are both scarce and rationed. Part of the difficulty x
in securing proper food in Cuba, the source reported, is its scarcity. The rest 2,
is the lack of organization in its distribution. In an attempt to combat the food =;
shortages, the Cuban Government has instituted a rationing system. The ration «
ards are issued to the public through the Committees of Defense of the Revolution
enerally, there is.one such committee each block, and different cards are . |

lused for different types of items. Disgp ti airtel 10/26/61, re "Foreign

The poor organization in the distribution of food--causing shortages
in some markets and surpluses in others--has given rise to a situation popularly
known in Cuba as Venta por la.Mbre..-Thig means the sale of a product without
Government: control, or the Mack markets; One of the answers of the tro
reginie to both thé shortages and the resulting black market, the source said, is

importation of supplies figpm Soyigt-b! gyrations. The inferiog'quality of

——many of the imported items, however, hal egedly caused growing discontent
