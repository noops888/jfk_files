TESTIMONY OF GORDON GRAY
1 Mr, Gray. I have always considered it a privilege to appear

prone (Aras 202) 544-4000

before a Senate Committee. As perhaps you know, I had a session
on July 5 with four members of the Committee staff, I should
\ixe to say, Mr. Chairman, that I found them courteous, intelligent,
pble and well informed. I hope that our meeting was a construc~
Live one.

I trust that I need not assure you that I wish to be as

‘helpful as I can, but I must remind you that we shall probably

be talking about situations which existed something like 15 to
1? years ago and I fear that my recollections are not as sharp
‘as I would like them to be, The staff members did give me

‘some refreshment by showing me memoranda which I believe will

j
‘sorm the basis for your questions. I might say that these were

i
jRemoranda which I had not seen before, and I believe that the

reason that they were not distributed to principals of what is

‘how called the Forty Committee was that President Eisenhower
wanted only one copy of notes of these meetings in existence
and that was to be kept in the files of the Director of the
‘Central Intelligence Agency. An exception was made in the case

of Cuba.

My own experience with the National Security Council and
intelligence matters in general was as follows:

. As Secretary of the Army from 1949 to 1950, I at one time
;

lyas a statutory menber of the NSC. “However, as you will recall

the 1949 amendments to the Act removed the Service Secretaries.
IX might parenthetically say that Senator Symington and I have
jp standing joke that we are the only living two people who have
i

‘aver been kicked off the National Security Council. He was at

the time Secretary of the Air Force,
H
In 1951 I established and served as the first Director of

the Psychological Strategy Board at the request, and by appoint-
\
ment of, President Truman. In 1953 I was a mamber of the

‘President's Committee on International Information Activities,

popularly known as the Jackson Committee. In 1955 I became

i i
: Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs
{

land in that capacity served as back up for the Secretary of

2 Defense for National Security Council matters. I attended all i
WSC meetings with him, In 1956 I became Director of the Office
‘pf Defense Mobilization in which capacity I was again a statutory
member of the National Security Council. In July 1958 I became

Bpecial Assistant to President Eisenhower for National Security

Affairs and the National Security Council and its subsidiary

bodies were among my responsibilities. In this capacity I also

perved as the President's representative to what was first

known as the 5412 Committee -- I believe it was 5412-2 Committee --

and later "Special Group," I having changed the name because

Steet, $f Waemmatnn, 9.6, 20002

5412 had attained some visibility. My understanding is that

subsequently it underwent at least two more hame changes, the

‘last being the Forty Committee. I consider this Committee ~~

yee Porty Committee -- a vital ona in the interest of the

Tuntted States and of the President. Indeed, when following
"instructions from President Eisenhower to leave everything
in the best possible shape tor his successor, and when I was
briefing HcGeorge Bundy, President Kennedy's to be Special
JAssistant for National Security Affairs, it became apparent
to me that it had probably already been decided that virtually
“all of the so-called machinery developed during Eisenhower's

F
Administration would be disbanded. I sought, and succeeded in

+ obtaining, one commitment from McGeorge Bundy and that was that

if he wanted to protect the interests of his President the one

thing that should be retained would be what is now known as

1 ithe Forty Committee. This commitment was kept.

Since May 1961 I have been a member of the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

I took no documents out of Government with me and have not
had occasion to read anything other than those shown me by the
Committee staff. As I have already observed, I never even saw
notes of the Forty Committee meetings and such memoranda in
this field as I made I think entirely related to Cuba. They
were produced in original form only and these are all at the
Eisenhower Library at Abilene.

That concludes my opening statement, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Gray.

Mr. Gray. That was my understanding.

Mr. Schwarz. Did the 5412 Committee ever approve an
action to assassinate Fidel Castro or any other person?

Mr. Gray. No, not while I was the President's representative.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, do you know that it did at any other

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Gray, this is what purports to be the

minutes of a Special Group meeting which you attended?

tmome (Aras 202) 344-4000

Mr. Gray. Yes, sir,

Mr. Schwarz. Would you look at the third page, please?

The document says that "Mr. Merchant asked whether any
real planning has been done for taking direct positive action
against Pidel, Raul, and Che Guevara.”

Mr. Merchant was a State Department representative on the

) Special Group?

Mr. Gray. Ile was, Yes, indeed,
Mr. Schwarz, Now would you agree that the words “direct
», positive action" appear to question whether there's been any
Planning in connection with assassinating those people?
Mr. Gray. JI think the phrase “positive action" could
include assassination, but I should say it is all the intent
“of the user of the phrase and his meaning of it, and I'm not
sure what was in Mr. Merchant's mind. I agree that assassination
could be included in that phrase, but I think, having had my
recollection refreshed by seeing this paper, which I had not
; Seen before, Mr. Merchant includes, or General Cabell pointed
out that this was not a practical option and he said it would
‘have to be concluded that Mr, Merchant's suggestion was beyond
our capabilities,

Mr. Schwarz. The Special Assistant to the President for

Mr. Gray. That is right, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Now there's a lengthy discussion of the
Seubject of Cuba and Mr. Castro, which runs, starts on page 2,
sand I would like to call your attention to some pieces of it

and see if it fits your recollection of attitudes in that

period of time.

H

Schwarz. Mr. Dillion -- that's Mr. Douglas Dillon.
Gray. That's right.

Schwarz. He takes the position on page 7, which is

the second page of the copy we have: "The result of Castro's
disappearance might be a Communist take-over."

Was that attitude expressed by people in connection with
Mr. Castro?

Mr. Gray. I am sure that there was. I don't remember
Mr. Dillon saying this but I have no doubt that it was a
concern of people at the time if Castro should not be in power
that there was a vacuum which might be taken over.

Mr. Schwarz. I'm just going to put in some exerpts from
the document which set the flavor and then read up to the
particular thing I want to question the Witness about.

on page 8, which is the third page, the President is

skipping downt “Latin American Presidents had counselled
jfurther forebearance by the United States."

i Skipping down further; The President is quoted as having
deaid he did not wish to endanger the lives of Americans living
jin Cuba.

: On the top of the next page the statement is made’ that
"owe might finally have to use force if U.S. citizens were

"exposed to mob violence." Then Admiral Burke is quoted as
saying we need a Cuban leader around whom anti-Castro elements
could rally.

Was that a problem, the lack of a replacement for Castro,

‘who would be preferable to the United States than Castro?

Mr. Gray. Yes, it was a problem. I think it was recogni
by many people who thought about it as a very serious problem
and I.remember very well, Mr. Schwarz, toward the, I guess the
end of the Eisenhower Administration that he used to press
the DCI, Mr. Dulles, Allen Dulles, very hard about the
possibility of a government in exile because he didn't want a

“vacuum left if something should happen to Castro to take him
out of power.

ce a chance to sea them then, The Cubans couldn't agree
jamong themselves, The Central Intelligence Agency had not
I think, by the time President Eisenhower went out of office,
been able to set up any kind of government in exile. I'm
not sure that one was ever set up.
Mr, Schwarz, Would the assassination of Mr. Castro prior
to there being a preferred replacement be consistent with
United States policy as you understood it during the time that

you ware in office? And I understand you're saying that

assassination wasn't approved, but I'm asking you a hypothetical

59

question, Would the assassination of Castro prior to the
identification of the preferable leader of Cuba have been
consistent with the United States policy?

Mr. Gray. Well, I can't answer that yes or no because
I must repeat that to my knowledge assassination was not
considered a sensible course of action at the highest levels
of government.

But I think that the other part of the question is that

30008

actions should probably not have been taken to relieve Castro
of power until there was some way to assure some sort of a

viable government ready to move in.

5.6 Wasmineton, 0.6

I'm not sure I'm responding to your question.
Mr. Schwarz. No, I think you did. Now I want to pick up
near the bottom of page 9 and read two sentences to you.

"Mr. Dulles reported that-a plan to affect the situation

an Cuba was being worked on, Admiral Burke suggested that any
“pian for the removal of Cuban leaders should be a package deal
'gince many of the leaders around Castro were even worse than
Castro.”

Now does the plan for the removal of Cuban leaders conten
jplate the assassination of Cuban leaders?

Mr. Gray. The plan that Mr. Dulles reported on that
‘yas being worked on on March 14 was a four-point program, and
1 am not sure, Hr. Schwarz, whether this meeting took place
before the President approved of the four-point program OF
immediately afterwards, but Mr. Dulles was certainly referring
to what I-call the four-point program which was approved
by the President and which formed the basis of various
activities which ultimately resulted in what we know as the
Bay of Pigs.

t have not had a chance to see that four-point paper,
I guess since I went out of office in the Eisenhower Admini-
stration. As I recall it, however, it included sabotage
increased or enhanced economic sanctions, propoganda activities
and the training of Cuban exiles.

Now this program was approved by the President. Subsequently,

in about March -- I don't know the date of it -- there were

preets 66, Wasminater © C. 20003

many meetings with the President about Cuba and this four-point
program and I recorded these meetings, 1 must say in violation

1 4 Mr. Schwarz, Now some related language is used in
2 paragraph 6 on page 2, which says:
pi “there was. a general discussion as to what would be the
i effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel and Raul Castro and Che
£ ‘Guevera should disappear aimultaneously. Admiral Burke said
€ that the only organized group in Cuba today were the Communists
7 ‘and there was therefore the danger that they might move into
& .control, Mr, Dulles felt that this might not be disadvantageous
"because it would facilitate a multilateral action by OAs.
Colonel King" == and he's with the CIA -- “said there were
few leaders capable of taking over so far identified."

Now the November 3 memo, which we marked as Exhibit 1,
which suggested no such authority to assassinate the three
men was ever granted, and indeed, that the CIA said it was
not a practical solution.

But do you not agree, Mr. Gray, that the language used in
here suggests that the subject of assassination was being
discussed?

Mr. Gray. At the level of the Forty Committee or the
National Security Council?

Me. Schwarz, Yes. These words should disappear simul-
taneously or any plan for removal should be a package deal,
which is the Security Council. ++

Mr. Gray, Ido not, no, sir. I again repeat that, “should

disappear"is like removal or eliminate. It is the intent of the

I paane and/or discussions of assassinations, but I am repeating
i

| that at the level of the Forty Committee or a higher level
‘than that, the National Security Council, there was no active

Ht Mr. Schwarz. Well, we agreed, remember, that there had

been one where it was turned down but it was discu
‘he the -November 3, 1960 meeting.

Mr. Gray. That's true.

Mc, Schwarz, And there the words used were “direct
positive action."

Mr. Gray. That's right.

Mr. Schwarz. And we agreed that that included assassinations
and there from the context you thought it probably meant
assassination.

Me. Gray. Mx. Schwarz, I will say I agree that assassination
could have been on the minds of some people when they used
these words eliminate or get rid of.

I cannot say that Admiral Burke, for example, wasn't
himself thinking of assassination. I am just trying to say eae
it was not serious considered as a program of! action by the
President or even the Forty group.

Mr, Schwarz. Do you think it is possible that persons

jmean overthrow the government, as opposed to murder the leader

land other persons, perhaps in the Central Intelligence Agency,
would interpret or misunderstand those worda to mean murder
‘the leader, kill the leader?

i Mr. Gray. I think this is possible. towever, the People
ite might have given it that interpretation in the Central

| intelLigence Agency had no authority to carry out such a plan.
i Mr. Schwarz. Your testimony is that it would be beyond

' chete authority to act to assassinate unless they had been
‘given a specific order,

Mr. Gray. Or unless it had been included in a specific
Program,

Mr. Schwarz, In other words, it would be beyond the
authority of the Agency, as you understood the Agency, to
rely upon general instructions such as we should take action
in order to overthrow the Castro government to constitute
authority for taking specific action to assassinate Mr. Castro
personally?

Mr. Gray. I agree with what you say and if I may just
Speak further to the point. The fact that there were many,
many meetings about Cuba with the President with sort‘of a
shifting group of top government leaders throughout three

quarters, at least, of 1960, and that is into January of '61

when the word “assassination” or that kind of activity within

to me that it was never in the President's mind or anybody

who were these important people in government that assassination

was considered a wise, sensible or practical thing to undertake.

i Mr. Schwarz. Actually, I'm going to start at the bottom
jet Page 4 and start with the comments made on Trujillo and

| then go to comments made on Castro and call your attention to
the different language that {a used.

With respect to Trujillo the following is stated:

"Mr. Dillon said there was one favorable aspect to the
situation in the Caribbean, If Trujillo could be removed from
a
‘power in the Dominican Republic while pro-Castro elements were

| Prevented from seizing power in that country, our anti-Castro '
ee throughout Latin America would receive a great boost.
The Vice President agreed that getting rid of Trujillo would
be a favorable development for us."

Do you understand the words “getting rid of Trujillo"
to mean assassinating Trujillo?

Mr. Gray. I did not understand that to mean _that. I
did not understand then and understand now it to mean assassina-
tion.

Mr. Schwarz. All right. Would you look at the next
Paragraph where it demonstrates that if people wish to talk
about assassination, they were quite willing to use the precise
word assassination, and what I would like to ask you after you
have read that, well, I may read it into the record:

“Turning to Cuba Mr. Dulles reported that a Senor Betancourt
(mo relation to Venezuela's Bentancourt) had recently defected

in Cuba and had told u.s, officials that he sees three possible

outcomes of the Cuban situation: (1) the assassination of

ycastzo. which would make him a martyr (2) Castro's suicide,

4

;which is a possibility in the event of failure and (3) a

continuation of the present trend, resulting ultimately in
a socialist dictatorship and a Batista-type terror in Cuba."

I guess the only question I had coming out of that is

was the point that the assassination of Castro would make him

ja martyr one which you heard discussed on more than one occasion

‘or was that the only time you heard about it?.

Mr. Gray. I think that this is the only time I hoard it,

{
ii "Mr. Schwarz. Here, of course, Mr. Dulles is quoting a Senor

“Betancourt, who is talking about the assassination of Castro.
Actually, I would now have to say that it's not unlikely that
it would have made him a martyr had he been assassinated.

Mr. Schwarz. Now has your recollection been refreshed
sufficiently for you to remember without my showing you a
document that during your service the special group authorized
the passage of weapons to dissidents in the Dominican Republic?

Mr. Gray. Yes, I think they were referred to as small
arms. That was in late December of '60 or early January of ‘61.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, let's put in the record as Exhibit 5

i. Mc. Schwarz. That thot planyacurrent -as-ofn December ay) would
not bring about the desired result "lacking some decisive
\gtrokea against Trujillo himself."
Wouldn't you read that to mean the stroke against Trujillo
himself is killing him?
4 Mr. Gray. I wouldn't so construe it.
Mr. Schwarz. How do you construe it?
Mr. Gray. Weli, other memoranda here I think reflect
other notes, reflect that various courses of action which
"ght take place in Cuba or Trujillo resigning, and I think
there was some negotiation to that effect.

Now you haven't mentioned in some of these minutes -~
these memoranda have refreshed my recollection that somehow
there was much more concern about Trujillo in many quarters
than there was about Castro, and it seemed important to some,

I now recall, that something should be done about Trujillo
and before anything was done about Castro.

Senator Mondale. Could I ask you about why are we #0
concerned about Trujillo? He was presumably friendly ‘to‘us, anti-
Castro, anti-Communist. What was the concern?

Mr. Gray. ‘I believe the concern was more in Latin America
than in the United States of America. I think they were
concerned about perhaps the way he governed his country, for

example. But I think it is reflected that the President or

high officials of our government were receiving some Latin

a That seems to be reflected as I read the minutes of the

Mr. Gray. Senator, I just don't recall the situation in
those terms, I'm sorry.

Senator Morgan. Pritz, if I remember, is that not
reflected in the minutes?

Mr. Schwarz. Yes, it is and there's also the thesis that
we needed to demonstrate that we wanted to move against both
“right wing and left wing to establish credibility in Latin

America for the movement against Castro.

Senator Mondale. That proves that nobody is safe.

Senator Morgan. I really think it might be well somewhere
for you to put that in the record because when we coma to
writing the report on Trujillo that we will want to know why.

Trujillo was the fear that Castro, a Communist take-over would

Isn't that the case, or do you recall, Mr. Gray?
Mr. Gray. Mr. Chairman, I just don't recall. I said to
iMe. Schwarz earlier, if I may repeat something I said earlier,
that it's a strange thing to me that my recollection about the
Dominican Republic is much dimmer than about many-.other things,

don't know why this is so. But my recollection is vary dim

that planning for the Congo would not necessarily rule out

contribute to getting rid of Lumumba."

Now do you agree that you contemplated and approved, at
least, the planning of the assassination of Lumumba in that

Mr. Gray. No, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. He has testified before us that he understood

Now, first, did you ever hear President Eisenhower himself
say anything which called for the Killing of Lumumba?

Mr. Gray. I do not recall him ever saying anything that
contemplated killing Lumumba.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you have any comment ona way or the
other which can help the Committee in understanding the
credibility of Mr. Johnson as a witness?

Mr. Gray. Yes, sir. _ Tis is the first thing that has
taken me by surprise, Mr. Schwarz. Your associates have been
very courteous, you have been very courteous,

In all of the discussions we have had Robert Johnson's

Mr, Gray. All right, sir.

Well, Robert Johnson, as I recall, was an able mamber of
ythe very small NSC staff which we had in those days, It was a

lean staff and I recall, I think, that I regarded him highly

-as an individual and as a staff man.

The thing that puzzles me is where he ever would have

; heard Eisenhower make that kind of a statement because I don't

“enink, I can't swear to this, that he ever attended a National

Security Council meeting, and I would wager that he never saw

Eisenhower in any other kind of capacity.
May I ask a question? Well, is this a sworn testimony?
Mr. Schwarz. Yes, it was and he describes it as being
in the summer at a meeting with a number of people with the

normal s@cretary away and that he was present at the meeting

to take notes.

Mr. Gray. -This is possible, I said that I would have

gathered that he attended a National Security Council meeting

but of course the notes of the meeting would indicate that.

In his testimony this Mr. Johnson, he said it was not
his normal course to be at the Full meetings of the National
‘Security Council, What he did was to fill in because it was
! the summer and people were away on vacations. He took the
jplace of the regular note-taker and he was startled by a
yremark made by the President following a briefing on the situation
vin the Congo with particular regard to Lumumba when the
"president said something to the effect of -- he was not clear in
“his mind about the exact words but the meaning remained in

his memory, mainly get rid of Lumumba.

Then he said that the question that arose, he wrote this

note-taker was, what to do with the notes. He said he could
not recall the exact words of the President and that it was
a long time ago and that what stuck in his memory was the
startling remark by the President and the stunned silence of
the people in the room.

Senator Tower, Why don't we have the minutes of that

Mr. Gray. Well, excuse ma, You see I don't know which

Tenat we're talking about {s a Special Group meeting.

Mr. Schwarz. And it doesn't show President Eisenhower
attending it.
i Mr. Gray. He never attended a Special Group meeting
except the meetings in his office on Cuba, which weren't
‘technically Special Group meetings themselves, But the Prosident
: never attended a Special Group meeting.
So the President couldn't have made dt in this meeting
and I would feel more comfortable having challenged the
credibility of Mr. Johnson for whom I stated I have 4 high
i regard.
If you can't find the minutes of the meeting that he
said he took notes on -- now to me it seems the Committee would
ie be interested if you would take his testimony seriously in
‘ trying to find out,
Mr. Schwarz. And that, Mr. Gray, is why we are looking;
we have not succeeded.
hr. Gray. And my second point again, and forgive me for
being repetitive, that he apparantly said that, he didn't
remember the exact word,but here again, get rid of or get
rid of Lumumba.

Well, it's no secret now. I've testified here that my

‘words were he construed them as meaning killing. He, Johnson,

Mr. Gray. Woll, I would like to say I disagree.
The Chairman. Hhat did you understand the Eisanhower
‘policy toward Lumumba to be -- take euch action, such covert
action as might be necessary to depose Lumumba?

Mr. Gray. That's right. This meeting moved to spend,

the last exhibit speaks of various types of covert action that

“might be taken and this minute reflects the fact that I said

that certainly the President had very strong feelings on the
necessity for straightforward action. :

I do not consider that to include any thought in his

of assassination,

Now this was a Special Group meeting in August. I don't
know when the National Security Council meeting at which Mr.
Johnson said he was present<

Mr. Schwarz. All we have is the summer,

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Gray, we had a chat over the recess and
‘you said you wanted to make some further comment. about the
questions we asked you concerning Mr. Robert Johnson.

Mr. Gray, Yes, thank you.

Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, I am troubled by this. Earlier

JI expressed my high regard for him as an individual and as

ja membor of my staff. I find myself now challenging his

'
Leredibility. This troubles me quite deeply. I just wanted

“ii that on the record.

' Also, I guess it is reasonable to point out that in any
event if he were to take notes of the meeting and if the
president did use the word “get rid of," it is the same kind
of language we've been talking about ever since I have been
sitting before the Committee.

Thank you, sir.

The Chairman. Given your close connection to President
Eisenhower on all covert action matters, do you believe that
it is possible that you might not have understood exactly what

_ President Eisenhower had in mind when such terms were used?
Are you confident that it was not the President's intention
and it was not the policy of his Administration to pursue any
means, including assassination for ‘the purpose of getting rid

thought of assassinating in Cuba, certainly there would have

at all. This is just not the way he would go about things.

Mr. Schwarz. All right. I want to ask you a broad question
about Cuba that will start with your testimony and then ask
ask you to assume certain facts as true and then ask you to
explain those facts to the best you can acting as an expert.

Was not, as far as you know, authorized by the Eisenhower

[petieve that President Eisenhower would have communicated to
jrou personally if a CIA official, Mc. Dulles, had come to see
‘nim to say that the CIA was seeking to assassinate Mr. Castro.
Mr. Gray. Yes, ir.
I believe that the President would have communicated any
1 such action or agreemant or order or approval to me, although
it must point out that I was not with President Eisenhower
,24 hours a day. It was a few minutes every day, practically
every day.
1 find it very difficult to believe, and I do not believe,
that Mc. Dulles would have gone independently to him with
such a proposal without, for that matter, my knowing about it
from Mr. Dulles.
Mr. Schwarz. All right, now third. You have testified
when we have examined Exhibit 1, which is the November 3, 1960
Special Group minutes, the Senators' Tab V, that you did
recall that meeting at which the subject of assassination was
brought up and it was rejected by the Special Group after hearine
from Mr. Cabell of the CIA ag being impractical. All right?
Mr. Gray. All right.
Mr, Schwarz. All right, now, assume, if you will, that
in fact prior to November 3, 1960, and at or about the end of
September, 1960, the Central Intelligence Agency made 4

contract with the Mafia to offer $150,000 if Mr. Castro were

killed.

q

{s fact. Wow, as a person with experience in the field of

trons (Aras 2027 544-4000

i national security matters, can you explain that fact in light
of your testimony?
-) Mr. Gray. I find it very difficult to explain, Mr.
6 schwarz. May I just speak about procedures for a moment, which
7 jw4ll help me answer your question, I think?
In the case of covort action, at least at that period of ,
time, although it may have been approved by the Agency itself -r
"I am now speaking about the Central Intelligence Agency -- the
normal procedure then would have ‘been for it to be staffed in

the State Department, I have already, I think, testified that

I complained that I was not given a chance to staff out some

of these matters, but that is perhaps aside from the point --
at which time both the State Department and the Agency. had
agreed it would have gone to the Forty Committee and if the
Forty Committee approved it, it would be approved, considered
approved by the government, unless, as in some cases, the
president's representative to the Forty Committee had a
question about the action and he wished to have a Presidential
decision, and that happened on a few occasions.

$0 now getting back to your specific question, how could
this thing have happened, one way it could have happened would
have been that it was well known in the Agency that there was

a program directed against Castro and that the people in the

TOP SECRET



TOP SECRET

yAgency assumed that that meant anything goas against Castro.

2 | This could hava been a possibility.

|

iquestion. A possibility of course is that the responsible

I rather guess that that is the Probable answer to tho

ipeople in the Agency simply felt they had the power to act on
their own, which I would have denied had it come to my attention.
{t amunable to, really to explain it. But Af it happened, it
“hs By judgment that it shouldn't have happened without the

: appropriate procedures being followed.

i]

J Mr. Schwarz. And your testimony is that those procedures
» iwere not followed.

Mr. Gray. I believe this to be the case. If I ever
heard of this Mafia thing before it recontly appeared in the
Press, I certainly have completely forgotten about it.

Mr.. Schwarz. It is the kind of thing you would remember
if you had ever heard it.

Mr. Gray. I would think so, I would think 90, yes.

Mr. Schwarz. So just to pin down what you said, well,
you are obviously not sure.. Your opinion is that the most
likely explanation is that the Agency personnel assumed
erroneously and mistakenly that the program with respect to
Cuba included the assassination of Castro, even though the
program in fact did not include thé “assassination of Castro.

Mr. Gray. I have to make that kind of assumption.

As a further observation about this we were referring to

TOP SECRET



TOP SECRET

Ja November 3 mating of the Special Group in which it was

| agreed when General Cabell said assassination is not a
‘practical alternative, I just can't understand how -- what
date did you say, Mr. Schwarz?

Mr. Schwarz, The record indicates the contract with the
Mafia was made tha end of September, 1960,

Mr. Gray. Now here is General Cabell on the 3rd of
November saying that this is not a viable alternative. I
find it difficult because he's the Deputy Director of the
Agency, and I don't think myself that he might have approved
an assassination attempt and would have come to the Special
Group saying that this is not the way to-go about things.

General Cabell was an honorable man, I think an able

5

Deputy Director. He would not, I think, have approved such
an action and then a few days later say this is not the kind
of thing that we should do.

Mr. Schwarz. So from your knowledge of his character
you would assume he, in fact, did not know of the contract with
the Mafia.

Mr. Gray, This would be my assumption.

The Chairman. Have you completed?

Mr. Schwarz. I do have one thing, I forget. Did you
and 1 discuss whether or not Vice President Nixon had a major
role in the Bay of Pigs? :

Mr. Gray. Yes, we didn't finish our discussion.

| Mr. Schwarz, I think you have something that might add
tL

ito the record on that.

1 Mr. Gray. I was saying to Mr, Schwarz that I am reasonably
sure -- this is not by way cf suggesting you shouldn't call
former President Nixon for any purpose you want to talk to

{him, but I am not talking aboutrthe Bay of Pigs. 1 am reasonably
sure he nover attended those meetings of the Special Group.
It wasn't really the Special Group. How can I refer to it --
"the Ad Hoc Committee that sort of was act up by the President

“0 deal with the Cuba program.

It is my strong recollection he never attended any of
those meetings. I think that what he would have known about
the Bay of Pigs would have been known to him -~ well, I say
the Bay of Pigs. What ultimately culminated in the Bay of
Pigs, the program against Castro, would have been known by
him only as it was discussed in the National Security Council,
and I cannot remember with what detail that program was
discussed in the National Security Council. I would have to
see the notés to refresh my recollection.

So that if he had an active role in what led’ to the Bay
of Pigs, I have forgotten what it was. I'm just saying that
I don't think he's gding to be too helpful on that particular
point.

Now let me say, please, if I may volunteer one other thing,

at the time that President Eisenhower went out of office on

“or no action committed, there was no military planning. As
ly matter of fact, I never heard -~ I'm geographically ignorant
parhaps, but I don't think I ever heard of the Bay of Pigs
until this thing came out. So cortainly there was no military
planning to land at the Bay of Pigs.

tn fact, General Eisenhower objected very strongly to
the fact that there was any military planning whatsoever when
he left office. And I expressed to Mr. Schwarz the personal
opinion this morning that this was bad three-months period
in American history when, after President Kennedy was elected,
he apparently felt he was not in a position to trust many of
the people around him. And my own judgment is had this thing
come a year later, either the Bay of Pigs operation would not
have been started or it would have been a successful operation.
And I think it is unfortunate for him and it was unfortunate
for him and for the country that this thing sort of came to
a head so quickly in his Administration,

The Chairman. Senator Schwoiker -- Senator Tower had
a sieverretet

Senator Tower. Referring to ‘rab E, page number 9, which
is exhibit 2, toward the end of the page there. These are

the minutes of the Security Council meeting of 10 March, 1960:

mr. Dulles reported that a plan to affect the situation

TOP SECRET

1 in Cuba was being worked on. Admiral Burke suggested that any
2 iplan for the removal of Cuban leaders should be a package deal
‘eine many of the leaders around Castro were even worse than

Castro."

Now did Mr. Dulles -- now the minutes are not detailed in
this instance, but can you recall whether or not Mr. Dulles
went into any detail on the plan to affect the Cuba situation
was being worked on?

Mr. Gray. May I take a minute to answer that question,

Mr. Chairman?

The Chairman. Surely.

Mr. Gray. I am not so sure how much I told you, Mr.
Schwarz and members of the staff and members of the Committec.
It's hard to remember.

I have been shown the minutes of the Special Group which
are dated, I think, February 27 -- anyway, in Pebruary of 1960
which dealt with the sabotage of sugar refineries, and I remember
the meeting. It was in the President's office in the Oval
Room and I remember it very clearly because there were schematic
drawings of sugar mills and Mr. Dulles and his technical
associates were demonstrating how this kind of sabotage could
take place, etcetera.

And I remember the President, and it is my recollection that
the President said, well, perhaps it's time to make a move

against Castro, but don't just fool around with sabotaging

TOP SECRET

sugar mills, If you want to move against the Castro government,
bring me a program which 1s going to be effective. They can
always repair the sugar mills, etcetera.

And as a result of that direction Allen Dulles cane back
to the President in my presonce and in the presence of others,
1 have forgotten who now, with a four-point program which
responded to the president's request to come up with something
more than just sabotaging sugar refineries.

I have not seen that four-point program since I left
government. It is in the library at Abilene and those four
points were sabotage, enhance the economic sanctions, propoganda,
which resulted, among other things, in the establishment .of
that Swann's Island radio, and the: training of Cuban exiles.

Now, Senator Tower, I would have to know the date of that
four-point program which was the beginning of all of this
to know, for example, to anawer your question as to how deeply
he went into detail at this meeting because he was either
preparing the four-point program or had just prepared it. It
was my recollection it was sometime in March that he presented
it to the President. The records would show this certainly
at Abilenc, and I remember very well that Mr. Dulles read from
this word for word without any deviation whatsoever to make
sure he was proposing a program that the President understood.

So that is sort of @ convoluted answer to your question.

I don't know at this time whether the program was in preparation

or had just boon adopted. Sut he certainly, according to this
i note, didn't go into any eeal"detail about it.

" Senator Tower. Well, here again, I'll read this to you.
“Admiral Burke suggested" now this was in response

Ito Mr. Dulles's report that the plan to effect the situation

Jan Cuba was being worked on, Admiral Burke's follow-on comment

twas "the suggestion that any plan for the removal of Cuban
of “ yeaders should be a package deal because many of the leaders
4
: around Castro were even worse than Castro.”
I would assume that that refers to Raul and Che Guevera.
Mr. Gray. Yes.

Senator Tower. So it would appear to me from that that

Mr. Dulles, if he went into any detail or at least it was

é
$

understood by Admiral Burke that the kind of plan being worked
on to effect the situation in Cuba had something to do with

the removal of Castro, perhaps not necessarily by assassination
put nerhaps by other means.

Then again, over P in numbered page 2, Exhibit 3, in the
Special. Group -- this is a memorandum for the record --

a Memorandum for the Pern numbered page 2, Item 6:

“phere was a general discussion as to what would be the
effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel and Raul Castro and Che
Guevera should disappear simultaneously.”

So this says to me that at least there was an awareness

‘and at least some contingency planning going on, I suppose

junder pulles's direction to effect the removal of Castro by
jsome means and those around him.
: Mr. Gray. Well, in the first reference, which is the
National Security Council meeting, he actually said that there
was a plan being developed and Admiral Burke apparently said
well any plan should be a package deal. Later on Admiral
burke again is expressing his opinion that the removal of
Castro by whatever means might result in a Communist takeover.
But let me romind you, please, Senator, that these meetings
were either the same day or one day apart, and 1 have already
said that I don't know whether that four-point program was
in existence under preparation or had been adopted. I just
would have to see the date of it. But I don't think you'll
find it.
Excuse me, Sir.
Senator Tower. Sure, go ahead.
Me. Gray. I don't think that Admiral Burke knew what
was in any four-point program at that time and I think he
was just expressing his own observation, Well, if you're
making plans these are the considerations that I have in mind.

Senator Tower. Well, a four-point plan, as T remember

you reconstructed it, included economic sanctions, propoganda

broadcasts, the training of Cuban exiles as guerrillas, I
suppose, and what was the fourth?

Mr, Gray. I think it was sabotage.

TOP SECRET



Senator Tower. Sabotage.

Mr. Gray. I think these are the four points.

Senator Tower. But none of those contemplate political
activity of the type that would result in the actual surgical
removal of Castro.

Mc. Gray. I understand that.

Senator Tower, These are less precise instruments of
adversely impacting on the Castro regime.

Mr, Gray. 1 simply have to repeat that 1 am reasonably
certain on March the 14th Admiral Burke was not privvy to the
plan that Mr. Dulles was referring to and that he was simply
expressing his opinion that if you have any plan at all, it
ought to take these factors into consideration that you might
end. up with a Communist government if you don't watch out.

And I think, well, I know I've already said thereafter

there was a lot of discussion about a government in exile to

avoid this kind of situation. My guess, ~~ I have to guess that

Arleigh Burke was just expressing an opinion when he was told
there was a plan being formulated. 1 don’t Know whether that
responds or not.

Senator Tower. All right,

Sénator Schweiker?

Senator Schweiker, ‘Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Gray, in the Special Group records that we are

Mr. Gray. Yes, sir,

Senator Schweiker. Mr. Merchant 1s whom? He represented
whom for this Special Group?

Mr. Gray. He was a State Department representative.

Senator Schweiker. And Mr. Irwin represented --

Mr. Gray. He was Defense Department. He was Assistant
Secretary of Defense and for Security Affairs.

Senator Schweiker. Now in your Structure set-up at
the Administration here General Goodpasturo played a role.

What was his role?

Mr. Gray. General Goodpasture's title was Staff Secretary.

Senator Schweiker. For the National Security Council?

Nr. Gray. No, for the President, for the Office of the
President, and that is a role which he Performed. .Now this wasn't
a cover name. If you wanted a secretary you had to
get Goodpasture to hire him, this sort of thing. He was
secretary to the whole White tlouse staff. He was also a
trusted confidant of the President, a distinguished military man,
as then, and subsequently, he was an unusual sort of man
and I think this is not irrelevant to your question, he
for example, though it's not generally know, has a PhD. from
Princeton, as well as being a four star general, and that is
Rot a common: thing, ‘The President used him, if 1 may over-
simplify, for spot matters. If he wanted to get a message to

the Pentagon or to the Joint Chiefs or perhaps even to Allen

Senator Schweiker, Was there a staff to direct over?
6 Were you a staff director?
Mc. Gray. My title was Special Assistant to the President
+ for National Security Affairs and by statute there is an
Executive Secretary, and his name was James Lay, James S. Lay.
Now the cause of the potential difficulties in having

two men dealing in somewhat the same field, it was the

practice between General Goodpasture and me to keep each other

fully informed when any of our activities impinged on the

3

activities and responsibilities of the other.

I thought this was a good way to operate the White tlouse
myself, but it did require two men of goodwill and mutual
respect or it wouldn't have worked too well, as you can guess.

So if I can oversimplify -- he was the spot man and I
was the long range planning man.

Mr. Schwarz. So you must have had a good working
relationship.

Mr. Gray. Well, sir, I'll say publicly, because you might
have him in ab a witness, if somehow he could get nominated

for President, 1 would vote for him. I don't know whether

he'd way the same about me.

Senator Schweiker, Well, I understand that John Zisonhower,
in the last couple of years of his father's administration,
also worked cither with, maybe with Genoral Goodpasture in
some context.

Is that correct or not?

Mr. Gray. Over in the White House? Oh, yes. He worked
for General Goodpaature in the White House.

Senator Schweiker. Would hea come into arcas =~ wall, would
either General Goodpasture or John Eisenhower come into that
kind of Special Group situation?

Mr. Gray. Thank you, because I should have explained this.
First, with respect to General Goodpasture, he was always
invited to sit with the National Security Council as an observer,
not as a participant, and generally did. :

So he knew what was going on in my field in that way-

John Eisenhower, never.

when some, usually when some covert action was approved

by the Forty Committee, { would inform General Goodpasture that
if it was of sufficient importance for him to know about it~
Never John.

What General Goodpasture informed John of I don't’ know,
but Gooupasture was not a representative of the Special, Group
and neither was John. He never attended the Special Group
meetings.

Senator Schweiker. Goodpasture did not attend the

He would have been the ranking mamber of the Council presiding.
I'm sorry, you've got me on this one. I cannot understand
because I always have taken the position when I read in the

[there isn't any such thing as the National Security Council

‘ subject of this discussion.
The Chairman. Well, I'll tell you one thing about it,
Mr. -Gray. It is no longer lean.
Mr. Gray. No, sir, I know that and I know very well
about that. But this is not the subject.
May I go off the record?
The Chairman. Certainly.
(Discussion off the record.)
Mr, Schwarz. Mr. Gray, I have a couple of things that
came up in your meeting with the staff I neglected to ask you.
Was there at some point during your government experience a
ny discussion of killing Nasser, and if so did it lead to anything?
I mean obviously he didn't die from assassination.
Mr. Gray. Yes, I'm glad to bring that up because I think

I got the impression I never heard the word “assassination”

used and that is not quite correct. I cannot remember which
year this was but probably 'S8 or '59, at the time when Colonel
reer was riding high. We were in the Planning Board of
jwhich I was Chairman, reviewing an NSC paper: which would go
Inaturally to the President and members of his Council on the
‘near and Middle East.
i And as we began discussions of this paper and views about
| what our relationships with and posture toward. Colonel Nasser,

“what should be this posture. And the original comments ranged
| a11 the way from one side, let's bump him off, to the other
extreme, let's get in bed with him. And I mean there was a
whole gamut of expressions.

Well, when we sat down to write the paper the word
“assassination” or “bump off" or anything of that sort never
appeared, nor did “get in bed with him," although it's interesting
that the CIA position at that time was that Nasser was the ;
wave of the future, that he would sweep across Africa and
we ought to get rid of him.

The President's decision finally was somewhere between
the extreme of getting in bed with him and of trying to limit
his capabilities somehow. Having.left the impression perhaps
I never heard "assassination" mentioned, I'11 guarantee it
never found its way into print if that paper and it was never
offered to the President as an option in that Middle East paper.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, is the point it didn't get into print,

lis that the only point you can say about Nasser?

Mr. Gray. Well, nobody seriously after the first discussion,

Inobody was putting forth that as an alternative.

I am not sure that answers your question.

Mr. Schwarz. Well, it! better, I think, than saying it
ydidn't get into print.

Mr. Gray. All right, it was not pressed.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you hear of any gther discussions of

lassassinations?

\ Mr. Gray. Yes, there's one other I mentioned to the staff

land I have forgotten, Can you refresh my recollection?

Mr. Schwarz. Yes. Was it a discussion when you were

iwith the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?

wr. Gray. Oh, yes. A former member of that Board, whom
i would just as soon not identify because I don't think it's
limportant to this Committee, when the DCI would appear before
: “ehe poard and we would be brief on Vietnam, on various occasions
"ghis member of the Board would say, have you given any
consideration to trying to bump off the leadership in Hanoi?
land I was never sure whether he was being facetious or not’
put in any event this was his question and the DCI would
_ buee shrug. ;
so watd come back to another meeting a couple of months
| dater and he'd say, have you yet given any consideration to

lbumping off the leadership in Hanoi? And the DCI would just shrug.

TOP SECRET

And I think the fact of the matter was the DCI didn't
feel he had the capability. Certainly he never responded
affirmatively to this question.

And I believe those are the two times that 7 really have
heard somebody seriously advocate at some point assassination,
and when I say,how serious it was, Lidon't know =. nothing,
lem sure there was never anyr planning to it.

Mr, Schwarz. Did you ever hear of the term Executive

Mr. Gray. Well, I had not heard of the term Executive

It is hard to read that sentence without at least construing

Mr. Schwarz. How do you construe the words "disposed of"?
Mr. Gray. I put it in the same category as “get rid of,"
“eliminate.” You see, it says eatlier that “a recent attempt

to assassinate Mobutu had failed." That's up at the ‘top of

intervention, This led to an involved discussion, the gencral conclusion
of which was that such action on our part would not be desirable, but
that ohould Castro be foolish enough actually to attack Guantanamo

thie would almost certainly mean war, Mr. Gray said that he had had
the subject of Cuba inscribed.on the NSC agenda for next Monday in
order to be able to arrive at a top-level decision on this-very point.

He thought it essential that the policy of the U.S. should be completely
understood by responsible officials, so that any overt Cuban act would
be met with a previously-agreed-on response.

Mr. Merchant stated that, apart from any attack on Guantanamo,
he thought that some of the previous argumentation in today's mecting
was faulty, in that we could not have it both ways. By this he meant
thet it is not logical to conclude that an indigenous uprising is impossible
and yet that it is feasible for the U.S, to go in overtly and "clean up
the mess." He poiated out that if Castro's support were such that an
uprising was out of the quesifon then an open invasion by the U.S. would
be met by 2 hostile populaticn and we would be plunged into a situation
like Algeria.

‘Turning to the immediate problem before the Group, Gen. Cabell
outlined the general proposal to establish bases in the U.S., with the
reasons for coming to this conclusion, He cited specificall
possibility of U.N. investigation in Guatemala cad the inere
of the program, which has been brought about by the increas
of the Castro regime. All members of the Group e:
doubts as to whether such activity could be kept at all secure.
Merchant said at one point, that although this does not represent 2
fina! conclusion on his part, he is inclined to think that the proposal
embodies the worst aspect of both worlds; that is, the choice should
rest between continuing our operations entirely on foreign soil or
preparing to make the best pessible case for overt interventi

associates at the

to move in
of keeping

a refugee org:
backstop the operations.



Mr. Douglas eaid that in any case he would be prepared to have
the Department of Defense invectigate the availability of specific
locations that would be suitable.

Finally, Mr. Merchant asked whether eny real planning has been

done for taking direct positive action against Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara.
-Hie gaid that without these three the Cuban Government would be Vi
lnaderless and probably brainless. He conceded that it would be :
necessary to act against all three simultaneously. Gen. Cabell pointed _+
ner that action of this kind is uncertain of results and highly dangerous

in conception and execution, because the instruments must be Cubans.

He felt that, particularly because of the necessity of simultancous

nation, it would have to be concluded that Mr. Merchant's suggestion

this would almost certainly mean war, Mr. Gray said that he had had
the subject of Cuba inseribed on the NSC agenda for next Monday in
order to be able to arrive ata top-level decision on this very point.

He thought it essential that the policy of the U.S. should be completely
understood by responsible officials, so that any overt Cuban act would
be met with a previously-agreed-on response.

Mr. Merchant stated thar, apart from any attack on Guantanamo,
he thought that some of the previous argumentation in today's meeting
was faulty, in that we could not have it both ways. By this he meant
that it is not logical to conclude that an indigenous uprising is impossible

reasons for coming to this conclusion, He cited specifically, the
possibility of U.N, investigation in Gue
of the program, which has been brought about by the in¢reased strength
of the Castro regime. Atl imembers of roup expressed serious

policy toward Cuba, Oar chjective is to bring another governnant

Vere successful in his effort to provoke us into intervention, the
Tasult would nelp the USSR, since American Intervention in Cura

of Soviet intervention in liungary. It was becoming more and more
likely that tle lav we originally planned to recomend to Congress
on sugar would not be passed; and indeed ve may not now want it
jassed. It had been planned to recommend en extension of the suger
Subsidy without change exccpt for the provision that the President
woald have authority to mexe changes at his discretion. Congress
wil probably. now want to go further than this recommendation. Mr.
Dillon reported that up to the present time he had Telt we should

Admiral Rurke believed we had a legal right to stay in

differed from Bizerte in that ve had been established in Guantanamo

thot the U.S. be prepared for rapid action. ‘The Vice President

would like to move inte the Dominican Republic and take over the
government. Mr. Dilicn believed the Castro element in the Dominican
Republic was not strong enough to assume control of the government
without support frou Cuba. It was, sccordingly, very important
thot the U.S. be prepared for rapid action. ‘he Vice President

Mr. Allen said USIA had been discussing means of presenting
foetual information to the Cuban people. His agency had been
under some pressure from U.S. newspapers und Kembere of Congress
on this point. The Senate had recently passed a resolution allo-
cating $100,000 to be used by USIA to buy time on Florida radio
stations for progres aimed ut Cuba. However, a conference com-

ites had refused the allocation of additional mony, cuggesting
nds already appropriated be used for the jurpose. Studies
had developed two possibilities for getting the factual

sation to the Cuban people. One project would be a 500

eirficulties. The F ‘ations Commiuclon,although

feared that the result would be a radio war in the western liemla=
here. In any cese, FCC would like to be heard Wfore being
directed by the HSC to proceed. Mr. Allen pointed wut that 1£
Mexico or Canada teamed programs to one of our cities from an
aircraft, we would be furious. A similar reuction might be ex-
pected from Castro. Morcover, if it became known thut we were
broadcasting on a particular channel, Cactro could ehivt his

Mr. Dillon was inclined to think that any contrived

ocd that while baseball broadcasting to Cuba had
Sone averactions, 1b was not sufficiently dignified for & U.S.

enough benefits to compensate Tor its disadvantages. The Vice
