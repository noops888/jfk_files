TESTIMONY OF GORDON GRAY

2

MI: Gray. I have always considerod it a privilege to appear

bafora a Senate Committee. Ma perhaps you know, I had a session

on July 5 with four members of the Committee staff. I should

5 Ilke to say, Mr. Chairman, that I lound them courteous, intelligent,

6

ablo and well Informed. I hope that our meeting was a construc-

7

tive ono.

8

I trust that I need not assure you that I wish to be as

9 helpful as I can, but I must remind you that ve shall probably

Ju be talking about situations which existed sonething like 15 to

::1ar years ago and I lear that my recollectione

are not as sharp

:.'as I would like them to be. The staff members did give me

13 "some refreshment by showing me memoranda unich I beliave will

Is for the badle for your questions.

I might say that these were

15

memoranda which I had not seen before, and I believe that the

16

reason that they were not distributed to principals of what is

17

now called the Forty Committee was

that President Eisenhower

!

i wanted only one copy of notes of these meetings in existence

' and that was to be kept in the files of the Director of the

* Central Intelligence Agency. An exception was made in the case

:: of cuba.

2: Intelligence matters in general was

as follows:

As Secretary of the Army from 1949 to 1950, I at one time

was a statutory member of the NSC. However, as you will recall

In 1951 I established and served as the firat Director of

the Psychological Strategy Board at the request, and by appoint-

ment of, President Truman. In 1953 I was a member of the

y President's Committee on International Information Activities,

Iu popularly known as the Jackson Committoo. In 1955 I became

1: Assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs

In land in that capacity served

as back up for the Secretary of

13, Defense for National Security Council mattors. I attanded all

14 NSC meetings with him.

In 1956 I became Director of the Office

15 0f Defense Mobilization in which capacity I was again a statutory,

16 member of the National Security Council. In July 1958 I became.

11 Special Assistant to President Eisenhower for National Security

Ic: Affairs and the National Security Council and its subsidiary

known as the 5412 Committee -- I believe it was 5412-2 Committee --

and later "Special Group," I having changed the name because

:: 5412 had attained some visibility. My understanding is that

subsequently it underwent at least two more hame changes, the

last being the Forty Committee. I consider this Committee --

Mr.

Schwars. Mr. Gray, this 1a what purports to be the

minutes of a Special Group meeting which you attanded?

Мг. Gray. Yes, sir.

MI. Schwarz. Hould you look at the third page, please?

The document says that "Mr. Merchant asked whether any

real planning has been done for taking direct positive action

against Pidal, Raul, and Che Guovara."

MI. Merchant was a State Department copresentative on the

¡ Special Group?

10

Mr. Gray. lle was. Yes, indeed.

Mr. Schwarz. Now would you agree that the words "direct

I:: positive action" appear to question whether there's been any

i" planning in connection with assassinating those people?

Mr. Gray. I think the phrase "positive action" could

1:: Include assassination, but I should say it is all the intent

i;'of the user of the phrase and his meaning of it, and I'm not

?: sure what was in Mr. Merchant's mind. I agree that assassination

:: could be included in that phrase, but I think, having had my

i: recollection refreshed by seeing this paper, which I had not

i: seen before, Mr. Merchant includes, or General Cabell pointed

out that this was not a practical option and he said it would

have to be concluded that MI. Merchant's suggestion was bayond

¡among themselves. The Central Intelligence Agency had not,

I think, by the time President Eisenhower went out of office,

Mr. Schwarz. Would the assassination of Mr. Castro prior

i you were in office? And I understand you're saying that

assassination wasn't approved, but I'm asking you a hypothetical

MI. Gray. Well, I can't answer that yes or no because

But

I think that the other part of the question is that

I'm not sure I'm responding to your question.

In Cuba was being worked on. Admiral Burke suggestod that any

?. "Plan for the ramoval of cuban loadore should be a package dent,

'since many of the leaders around Castro were even worse than

: Castro."

Now does the plan

for the removal of Cuban leaders contem-

o iplato the assassination of Cuban leaders?

7

Mr. Gray. The plan that MI. Dulles reported on that

* was being worked on on March 14 was a four-point program, and

! I am not sure, Mr. Schwarz, whether this meeting took place

before the President approved of the four-point program or

::immediately afterwards, but Mr. Dulles was certainly referring

:: to what I. call the four-point

program which was approved

by the President and which formed the

basis of various

; activities which ultimately resulted in what we know as the

:: Bay of Pigs.

I have not had a chance to see that four-point paper,

i: I guess

since I went out of office in the Eisenhower Admini-

:: stration. As I recall it, however, it included sabotage,

:: Increased or enhanced economic sanctions, propoganda activities,

and the training of Cuban exiles.

:.

Now this program was approved by the President. Subsequently,

:.:

in about March-- I don't know the date of it -- there were

:.

many meetings with the President about Cuba and this four-point

Mr. Schwarz. Now some related language is used in

¡Paragraph 6 on page 2, which says:

"There was. a general discussion as to what would be the

i effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel and Raul Castro and Che

- Guevera should disappear simultaneously. Admiral Burke said

E :that the only organized group in Cuba today were the Communists

"and there was therefore the danger that they might move into

*. control. Mr. Dulles falt that this might not be disadvantageous

because it would facilitate a multilateral action by oAs.

i" "Colonel king" -- and he's with the CIA -- "said there were

¿: few leaders capable of taking over so lar identifled."

Now the November 3 memo, which we marked as Exhibit 1,

which suggested no

such authority to assassinate the three

i men was ever granted, and indeed, that the CIA said it was

not a practical solution.

But do you not agree, Mr. Gray, that the language used in

here suggests that the subject of assassination was being

discussed?

2

mean overthrow the government, as opposed to murder the leader

and other persons, perhaps in the Central Intelligence Agency,

Mr. Gray. I think this ia possible. However, the people

who might have given it that interpretation in the Cantral

Intelligence Agency had no authority to carry out much a plan.

Mr. Schwarz. Your testimony is that it would be beyond

their authority to act to assassinate unless they had been

Mr. Schwarz. In other words, it would be beyond the

Mr. Gray. I agree with what you say and if I may just

speak further to the point. The fact that there were many,

MI. Schwart. Actually, I'm going to start at the bottom

of page d and start with the comments made on Trufillo and

then go to comments made on Castro and call your attention to

i the different language that la used.

With respect to Trujillo the following is stated:

6 :

"Mr. Dillon said there was one favorable aspect to the

• jaltuation In the Carlbbean. Il Irujillo could be removed from

power in the Dominican Republic while pro-Castro elaments were

prevented from seizing power in that country, oui anti-Castro'

i campaign throughout Latin America would receive a great boost.

!: The Vice President agreed that getting Ild of Trujillo would

1: be a favorable development for us."

Do you understand the words "getting rid of Irujillo"

14

to mean assassinating Trujillo?

1:.!

ME. Gray. I did

not understand that to mean that. I

did not understand then and understand now it to mean assassina-

Mr. Schwarz. All right. Would you look at the next

paragraph where

it demonstrates that if people wish to talk

¿ about assassination, they were quite willing to use the precise

word assassination, and what I would like to ask you after you

2r. have read that, well, I may read it into the record:

"Turning to Cuba MI. Dulles reported that a Sonor Betancourt

2; (no relation to Venezuela's Bentancourt) had recently defected

2: in Cuba and had told U.S. officials that he sees

outcomes of the Cuban situation: (l) the assassination of

2

Castro, which would make him a martyr (2) Castro's sulcide,

which 1s a possibility in the event of failure and (3) a

continuation of the present trend, resulting ultimately in

a socialist dictatorship and a Batista-type terror in Cuba."

I guess the only question I had coming out of that is

7

was the point that the assassination of Castro would make him

-i=

a martyr one which you heard discussed on more than one occasion,

I for was that the only time you heard about it?.

Mr. Gray. I think that this is the only time I hoard it,

MI. Schwarz. Here, of course, MI. Dulles la quoting a Senor

' Betancourt, who is talking about the assassination of Castro.

Actually, I would now have to say that it's not unlikely that

:; It would have made him a martyr had he been

assassinated.

MI. Schwarz. Now has your recollection been refreshed

sufficiently for you to remember without my

showing you a

"document that during your service the special group authorized

• the passage of weapons to dissidents in the Dominican Republic?

• MI. Gray. Yes, I think they were referred to as small

arms. That was in lata December of '60 or early January of '61.

MI. Schwarz. Well, let's put in the record

Mr. Schwars, That tha plan, current an of Dacitber al, would

Wouldn't you read that to mean the stroke against trujillo

might take place in Cuba or Trujillo resigning, and I think

there was some negotiation to that effect.

Mr. Gray. I believe the concern was more in Latin America

concerned about perhaps the way he governed his country, for

Senator Morgan. Wasn't part of 1t, MI. Gray, at that time

the fact that he had previously arrested a large number of

had alleviatad some of this opposition but he lost general

It was thought that he was going to either fall or abandon

That seans to be reflected as I read the minutes of the

MI. Gray. Senator, I just don't recall the situation in

Senator Morgan. Piltz, if I remember, is that not

it, MI. Schwarz. Yes, it is and there's also the thesis that

Senator Mondale. That proves that nobody is safe.

¿: In fact prior to November 3, 1960, and at or about the end of

Assume that to be a fact, as the rocord indicates. It la

fact. llow, as a parson with experience in the field of

national security matters, can you explain that fact in light

of your testimony?

Mr. Gray. I find it very difficult to explain, Mr.

6 iSchwarz. May I just speak about procedures for a moment, which

> will help me answer your question, I think?

In the case of covort action, at least at that pariod of

time, although it may have been approved by the Agency itself -

I am now speaking about the Central Intelligence Agency -- the

.: normal procedure then would have boen

for it to be staffed in

:: the State Department. I have already, I think, testified that

: I complained that I was not given a chance to staff out some

:;of these matters, but that is perhapa aside from the point

at which time both the State Department and the Agency had

agreed it would have gone to the forty Committee and if the

Forty Committee approved it, it would be approved, considered

approved by the government, unless, as in some cases, the

.. President's representative to the Forty Committee had a

:. question about the action

and he wished to have a Presidential

:. decision, and that happened on a few occasions.

so now getting back to your specific question, how could

i..

this thing have happened, one way it could have happened would

have been that it was well known in the Agency that there was

a program directed against Castro and that the people in the

Agency assumed that that meant anything goas against Castro.

This could have been a possibillty.

I rather guess that that is the probable answer to tho

: Iquestion. A possibility of course is that the responsible

i people in the Agency simply felt they had the power to act on

o their own, which I would have denled had it come to my attention.

" I am unablo to, really to explain it. But if 1t happened, it

1s py judgment that it shouldn't have happoned without the

appropriato procedures baing followed.

MI. Schwarz. And your testimony is that those procedures

1:

were not followod..

MI. Gray. I belleve this to be the case. If I ever

heard of this Mafia thing before it recontly appeared in the

:: press, I certainly have completely forgotten about it.

MI.. Schwarz. It is the kind of thing you would remember

.iIf you had ever heard it.

MI. Gray. I would think so. I would think so, yes.

MI. Schwarz.

So just to pin down what you said, well,

.. you are obviously not sure.. Your opinion is that the most

: Likely explanation is that the Agency personnel assumed

erroneously and mistakenly that the program with respect to

:: Cuba included the assassination of Castro, even though the

:: program in fact did not include the assassination of Castro.

MI. Gray, I have to make that kind of assumption.

As a further observation about this we were referring to

Mr. Schwarz. The record indicates the contract with the

a find it difficult because he's the Deputy Director of the

¿ bring me a program which is going to be effactive. They can

• always repalr the sugar mills, etcetera.

And as a result of that direction Allon Dulles came back

! to the President in my presence and in the presence of others,

¿ I have forgotten who now, with a four-point program which

responded to the Prosident's request to come up with something

* more than just sabotaging sugar refineries.

I havo not seen that four-point program since I left

; government. It is in the library at Abilone and those

four

:: points were sabotago, enhance the economic sanctions, propoganda,

:: which resulted, among other things, in the establishment.of

that Swann's Island radio, and the training of Cuban exiles.

Now, Senator Tower, I would have to know the date of that

: four-point program which was the beginning of all of this

i to know, for example, to answer your guestion as to how deeply

• he went into detail at this meeting because he was either

preparing the four-point program or had just prepared it. It

: it to the President. The records would show this certainly

:. at Abilene, and I remember very well that Mr. Dulles read from

i: this word for word without any

deviation whatsoever

to make

sure he was proposing a programthat the President understood.

So that is

sort of a convoluted answer to your question.

Inote, didn't go into any real'dotall about it.

Senator Tower. Well, here again, I'll road this to you.

"Admiral Burke suggested" -- now this was in response

' Ito Mr. Dulles's report that the plan to elfect the situation

¡was "the suggestion that any plan for the removal of Cuban

: leaders should be a package deal because many of the leaders

around Castro wore even worse than Castro."

I would assume that that rafars to Raul and Che Guevera.

MI. Gray.

Yes.

Senator Tower. So it would appear to me

from that that

•Mr. Dulles, if he went into any detail or at least it was

understood by Admiral Burke that the kind of plan being worked

on to effoct the situation in Cuba had something to do with

' but nerhaps by other meang.

Then again, over P in numbered page 2, Exhibit 3, in the

& Memorandun for the Record, numbered page 2, Item 6:

"There

was a general discussion as to what would be the

used and that is not quite correct. I cannot remember which

year this was but probably '58 or '59, at the time when Colonel

3

Nasser was riding high. We were in the Planning Board of

; which I was Chairman, reviewing an NSC paper which would go

5

6

naturally to the President and members of his Council on the

Near and Middle East.

And as we began discussions of this paper and views about

what our relationships with and posture toward. Colonel Nasser,

what should be this posture. And the original comments ranged

In fall the way from one side, let's bump him off, to the other

:? extreme, let's get in bed with him. And I mean there was a

12: whole gamut of expressions.

Well, when we sat down to write the paper the word

?; "assassination" of "bump off" or anything of that sort never

it appeared, nor did "get in bed with him," although it's interesting

16; that the CIA position at that time was that Nasser was the

In wave of the future, that he would sweep across Africa and

1: we ought to get rid of him.

The President's decision finally was somewhere between

the extreme of getting in bed with him and of trying to limit

.. his capabilities somehow. Having left the impression perhaps

?: I never heard "assassination" mentioned, I'll guarantee it

never found its way into print in that paper and it was never

2

Mr. Gray. Well, nobody seriously after the first discussion,

nobody was putting forth that as an altarnative.

I am not gure that answers your question.

5

MI. Schwarz. Well, It's better, I think, than saying it

didn't got into print.

7

Mr. Gray. All right, it was not pressed.

8

Mr. Schwarz. Did you hear of any other discussions of

lassassinations?

16:

MI. Gray. Yes, there's one other I mentioned to the staff

1:

jand I have forgotten. Can you refresh my recollection?

1:.

MI. Schwarz.

Yes. Was it a discussion when you were

14

with the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?

Mr. Gray. Oh, yes. A former member of that Board, whom

I would just as soon not identify because I don't think it's

important to this Committee, when the DCI would appear before

the Board and we would be brief on Vietnan, on various occasions

this member of the Board would say, have you given any

consideration to trying to bump off the leadership in Hanoi?

And I was never sure whether he was being facetious or not.

2

But in any event this was his question and the DCI would

2n dust shrug.

So we'd come back to another meeting a couple of months

2:

later and he'd say, have you yet given any consideration to

25

bumping off the leadership in Hanoi? And the DCI would just shrug.

And I think the fact of the matter was the DCI didn't

And I believe those are the two times that I really have

heard somebody seriously advocate at some point assassination,

and when I say how serious it was, l'don't know be nothing,

I'm sure there was never any! planning to it.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever hear of the term Executive

Action?

Mr. Gray. Well, I had not heard of the term Executive

I Action that I recall until one of the counsel of the Rockefeller

Commission asked me this. No, I am sorry. I can't be more

accurate.

MI. Belin, in my pre-appearance conference, asked me

if I knew the phrase Executive Action. I told him, I said

Senator

Schweiker. I was wondering whether General

Johnson kept the minutes of that meeting.

Mr. Schwarz. General Johnson was the one we had with

General. Taylor, and this: is Mr. Johnson.

The Chairman. It is very difficult to read that sentence,

the one that Senator Schweiker has pointed out: "Mobutu

appeared to be the effective power in the Congo for the moment,

14

but Lumumba was not yet disposed of and

remained a grave

1:.

danger as long as he was not disposed of."

16

It is hard to read that

sentence without at least construing

17

it to mean that Lumumba was still alive and until he was no

longer alive, he was a danger.

Senator Schweiker. What was the time seguence, if I

2

might ask the counsel, of the meeting that Bissell had about

disposing of Lumumba? When did that occur?

Mr. Schwarz. The fall or the summer.

Mr. Schwarz. Senator Schwelker, I am told --

The Chairman. Can you interpret that

What in your judgment did that sentence mean knowing what you

MI. Gray. I would have to study it a little more,

Senator Schweiker, I think, has quoted the last sentence

that paragraph, which says that Mobutu appeared to be the

effective power in the Congo for the moment but Lumumba was

not yet disposed of and remained a grave danger as long as

16

he was not disposed of.

MI. Grayl. I have already testified

we were

after Lumumba,

and as I say I remembered the name Mobutu. I have also testified

that the situation was fluid and chaotic. And as it turned

out, I think, finally we didn't do anything.. The United Nations

was

put in charge of it.

2: 1

Mr. Schwarz. How do you construe the words "disposed of"?

2: Mr. Gray. I put it in the same category as "get rid of,"

¿:"eliminate." You see, it says earlier that "a recent attempt

to assassinate Mobutu had failed." That's up at the top of

There's no suggestion that we had attempted

MI. Schwarz. No, it had never been suggested. But does

once more as to the status of planning for

problems which would arise post-Castro. Me. Merchant said he

would check inio the progress of inc Siate Department group whici

From this the Group launched into a far-ranging discussion of

the entire concep: oí U.S. efforis agains: Castro.

Mr. Douglas icierred to the exicosive program oi tic militia, Mr. Gray

on the increasing eifcetiveness oi Castro's measures to controi te

population in ways witch ine Coinmunists have developed so well. The

He supperied tie posability of using the ClA-bacred exiles to modat a

intervention. This led to an involved discussion, the gencral conclusion

of which was that such action on our part would not be desirable, but

that should Castro be foolish enough actually lo atlack Guantanamo

chia would almost certainly mean war.

Mr. Gray said that he had had

the subject of Cuba inscribed. on ihe NSC agenda for nest Monday in

order to be able lo arrive at a top-level decision on this very point.

• He thought it essential

that the policy of the U.S. should be coinpletcly

undersiood by responsible oficials.

so tiai any overt Cuban act would

be met with a previously-agrecd-on resposse.

Mr. Merchant stated thai, apart from any attack on Guantanamo,

he thought tbat some of the previous argumentation in loday's meeting

was faulty, in that we could no: have it both ways. By this he meant

that it is nor logical to conclude ihat an indigenous uprising is impossible

and yet that it is feasible ior me U.S, to go in overuly and "clean up

the mess." He pointed out that ií Castro's support were such that an

uprising was out of the quesiion ten an open invasion by the U.S. would

ue met by a hostile population and we would be plunged into a situation

likc algeria.

Turning to the immodiaic problem before the Group, Gen. Cabell

outlined the general proposal to establish bases in tie U.S., with the

rcasons for coming :0 this conclusion. He cited specifically ihe

possivility oi U.N. investigation in Guaremala and the increased scope

of the program, ihich has bock brough: about by the incrcased sirengih

of the Castro regime.

Allancibors of the Group expressod serious

doubts as to whether

such activity could be lopi at all sccure.

Merchant said at one point, that although inis does no: represent a

final conclusion on his part, he is inclined lo think that lie proposal

embodies the worst aspect of doih worlds; thai is, the choice should

rest between continuing our operations entirely on foreign soil or

preparing to make to best possible case lor overt interiention.

MI. Gray suggested that the accision could be put up :o his

that this is where ii should end up, but ascered that he is not prepared

problems which would arise post-Castro.

Me. Merchant said lie

would check inio the progress of the Siate Department group which

has been charged with developing recommendations on this matter.

From this the Group launched into a far-ranging discussion of

the entire concepi oi U.S. efforts agains: Casiro. Mr. Dóuglas,

supporied by d!a. Gray and li.

Merchant, expounded ine icoa that

perhaps things rare now progressed to a point wacre covort activities

of the type originally envisaged ¿or ClA 10 underian, mili not be ellective.

115. Douglas rcierred to the excensive program oi the militia, Mr. Gray

cited the matter of arms fron: the Soviet bloc,

andar. Merchant dweli

on the increasing cifectiveness of Castro's measures to control the

population in ways witch the Communists have doveloped so well.

T'bc

latter said

tia: be and others in the State Department had origirally

thought that a popular rebellion wouid develop within Cuba and that

this could be augmenied by to comparatively small-scale clicris oi

exiles under Cl control.

Now Lie same people are beginning to decl

more and more that despite tie aumorous detections and to economic

duprivations being experienced sy to middle and spper classes, time

is actually worring on Castro's

sidt.

Me. Murchant snid that he

foresaw unt there would occur a point in time beyond which covert

intervention would not do the job.

Mr. Gray expressed lie opinion this we will neverbe able io

"clean up" the siuntion withou: the use di over: U.S. military force.

He suggesiod the possibility of using the Cla-backed exiles to mount a

simulated snack on Civantanamo in order to offer an excuse ior overt

...

intervention. This led to an involved discussion, the general conclusion

of which was that such action on our part would not be desirable, but

that should Castro be foolish enough actually to attack Guantanamo

Lis would almost certainly mean war.

Mr. Gray said that he had had

the subject of Cuba inseribed on the NSC agenda for next Monday in

order to be able to arrive al a top-lovel decision on this very point.

• He thought it essential

that the policy of the U.S. should he coinpletely

undersiood by responsible

officials, so tiai any overt Cuban act would

be met with a previously agreed-on resporse.

Mr. Merchant stated thai, apart from any attack on Guantanamo,

he thought ibat some of the previous argumentation in today's mecting

was faulty, in that we could not have it both ways.

By this he meant

thit it is not logical to conclude that an indigenous uprising is impossible

and yot that it is feasible for the U.S, to go in overtly and "clean up

the mess. " He pointed out that if Castro's support Were such that an.

uprising was out of the question then an open invasion by the U.S. would

ue met by a hostile population and we would be plunged into a situation

like Algeria.

Turning to the immediaie problem bofore the Group, Gen. Cabell

outlined the general proposal to establish bases in the U.S., with the

rcasons for coming io this conclusion.

of the program, which has bock brough: about by the increased strengih

of the Castio regime.

111 members oi the Group expressed scrious

doubts as to whether such activity could be Acp: at all secure.

• Merchant said at one point, thai although this does no: represent a

final conclusion on his

part, he is inclined to think that the proposal

embodies the worst aspect of both worlds; that is, the choice should

rest between continuing our operations entircly on foreign soil or

preparing to malic the best possible case ior overt intervention.

Mr. Gray suggested that the decision could be put up to his

associates at the samo lime Tiber is discussed.

Ar. Merchant agreed

that this is where it should end up, but assorice that he is not prepared

Finally, Mr. Merchan: asked whother any real planning has been

done for taking direct positive action against Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara.

Tie said that without those three the Cuban Government would be

Icaderless and probably brainless.

He conceded that it would be

necessary to act against all three simultar.cously. Gen. Cabell pointed

out that action of this kind is uncertain of results and highly cangerous

in conception and execution, because the instruments must be Cubans.

He felt that, particularly because óf the necessity of simultancous .

situation.

U.S. POIICY TONARD CUBA

(NSC Action No. 2165-b-(1); NSC 5902/1; NSC Mellon No. 2177)

Mr. Gray then briefed the Council on the Plunning Board dis-

cussion of U.S. Policy toward Cuba.

(A copy of It. Gruy's Briefing

liste in filed in the Minutes of the Meeting and another is attached

to this Memorandum)

It. Dillon rerarked that ony threat to the safety of U.S.

citizens in Cuhe would probably develop

overnight.

Ine Country

Tean report that there was no hope of satisfactory relations with

aba, while

nex, was mercly a confirmation of our lasic curent

policy towurd Cuba.

Our objective is to bring another govertrent

to power in Cila.

This objective is not being ronlized at the

resent time because there

is no apparent alternative to the present

soverment in the event Castro disappoure.

Indeed, thie result of

Cestro's disappearence migit be a Cormnist tre-over.

Il Castro

were successful in his erfort to provole us into intervention, the

result would help the lisse, since American intervention in Cuta

would

of the world as a counterpert

o? Soviet intervention

in Hungary.

It was becoming

more and more:

likely

that the law we

originally

planned to recommend to Congress

on sugar would not be passed; and indeed we may not now want it

passed.

It had been planned to reconnend

an extension of the sugar

subsidy without change excupt for the provision that the President

would have authority

to meke changes at his discretion.

Congress

mili probably nod want to go further than this recommendation. Ir.

Dillon rejorted that up to the present time he lad

differed from Mizerio

in that we had been established in Cuantanamo

for along time and there were no Cubans living Inside the bace

Cutting off

If the water supply

In fact, we had feared for

be avie to bold it against a Cuban armed attack.

Mr. Dulles

reported that in

the Dominican Republic, Trufillo's

position continued to weaken and

was now quite prechrious.

wholerale arrests ordered by Trijillo last winter had affected

almost

every

prominent family

In the DominicarRepnblle.Although

theoe arrests had broken up

the plotting against trufillo, they

had nt the

sume time, beatened the dietntor'e position. Mr. Dulles

thought that further attempts could

be made to kill or oust

Trujillo.

Aclationg

between the government and the church were

pidly deterlorating.

Ah. Dulles pointed out incidentally that

the altitude of

the church in the Dominican Republic was quite

different fron

the ettitude of the church in Cubr. Mie economic

stuntion in the toninich Rejublic was worsening.

lusiness 16

stigmant and

International finuncial

sources are drying up. The

goverment has

resorted to verious subterfuges in an attenpt to

improve its precarious financial

position.

Secretary Gates

asked

whether it was true that Trujillo was one of the richest men in

the world, with more money than the Dominican governnent. Mr. Dilles

said this

slatement

was true; Trujillo was reforted to have milked

the Doninican remblie of 5:00 million, an estimate which was

probanly exaggerated and should be scaled down by one-half or tro-

thirds.

Secratary inderson said lic

understood that til nillion

in dold had been recently removed from lew York banis by the

Doninican Republic and had been pleced in the Fant. ot Move Scotle.

il. iulles said le ind

a. detailed report on the finuncial situ-

stion of the terinican Republic, all the detaile of which he would

not roud. lonever, it appeared that the Datinican kupblic now

neld $15 million in gold and that it had incurred a victy of

chligntions; for example, a $10.5 million loan from the Bank of

Hova Scotia

secured by the sugar crop.

The Dominican Republic'

hed also drawn $7 million out of a $1l.5 million credit with the

International lionelary Fund.

Secretary Anderson said the Inter-

national lonetery Mind's dealings with the Doninican Republic

aight present a proolen

to the U.s.

The Doninicen Republic now

had drawn so much from the Flind that it could only draw in the

future f2. million every 90 isys without consulting the Directors

of the Fund.

If the Dominicans should want to draw more than

$2 million every 90 days, the question would arise as to how the

U.S. Director should vote when the Dominican Republic undertakes

the necessury consultation with the Fund.

Mr. Dulles, continuing his riefing, reported that 'Prujillo,

epferently

not reallzing its position,

is not anticipating on

carly fall. from pover and is apparently not planning flight.

The Dominican military. forces have apprently been repelled by

the excesses in Cube and may believe they will be compelled to. act

Tie Vice President wondered whether the worut outcome of

the situation in tie dominican Republic would not be a take-

over oy the pro-Castro elements.

Ile

also wondered whether we

vere doing everything possible to support other elemento.

Dulles said the difficult question was that of leaderchip of

noierate elements in the Dominican Republic. The vice president

or the Republic might be able to assume power or the principal

milliury officers right covern through a nilitary juntu..

Hominent antl-trujialo Dominicuns were in exile. Mr. Dillon

said this government was following the situation in the Doninican

Republic closely and Intended to try to prevent seizure or power

by any pro-Castro troup.

This would irvolve working closely with

the dis.

The Vice President believed

that we could not let Castro

or a pro-castro group take over the Dominican Rejublic even if

we had to intervere in cider to prevent such a takeover. Mr.

Dillon felt thut in order to intervene we would need on invitation.

Te Vice Fresident feared thut the old

story was icing repeated

in the Dominican Repuülic; that 16, thie

pro-Castro clement wus

the caly minority group with atrong leaderchip and definite ob-

jectives.

Hir. Dulles said there vas a ercup in Venezuela

which

would like to move into the Dominican Repuulic und take over the

coveriacnt.

Mr. Dilion believed the Castro elcuent in the Dominican

Republic was not strong enough to assure control of the government

without support fron Cuba.

It was, accordingly, very important

that the U.S. be prepared for rapid action.

The Vice President

agreed that it was very important that the U.S., If necessary,

take rapid action to prevent any move by Castro to seize power

in the Dominican Republic.

Dulles said the situations in laiti and Venezuela were

being artected by the situations in Cuba and the Doninican Republic.

Bitancouri, it 15 reported, has made a deal with the erry whereby

he will evandon government by coalition, will rule Verezuela with

So much for the technical difficultles of

There were

other difficulties also.

Bcaming tele-

vision programs

fom from which to denounce the U.S. for television auzression.

He could pose as a martst, saying he was a victim of

on balance,

some attractions; it was not sufficiently dignlfied for a u.s.

progren.

Tic Vice President agrerd that broadcasting from an

airplane would be counter-productive; it would not produce

enough berefits to compensate for its disadvantages.

The Vice

President id no objection to taking action which would be bit-

terly protested by Custro provided

such, "ction sould really

Tie Conventions

ulso contain

the principle that nations should not broadcast on

Mr. Dulles reported that

In the Dominican Rejriblic, Trujillo's

position continued

to weaken and was now quite precurious.

The

wholesale arrests

ordered by Trujillo last winter had affected

almost every prominent family in the

these arrests had broken up

DomtnicanRepull1c.Although

the plotting against trujillo, they

hod nt the

sume tine workened the

dictator's position. Mr. Dulles

thought that further attenpts would be made to kill or cust

Trujillo.

Relations

between the government and the church were

rapidly deterlorating.

In. Dulles pointed out Incidentally that

Che attltude

of

the church in the Dominican Republic was quite

different fron the ettitude of the church in Cub.

Mie economic

situation in the ioninican Regublic was

worsening.

Mriness 18

stagmnt.and International finuncial sources are drying up.

Thie

government has resorted to various

subterfuges in an attenpt to

improve its precarious financial position.

Secretry Gates asked

whether it was true that Trujillo was

one of the richest men in

the world, with more money than the Dominican goverment. Mr. Dilles

said this slatement was

true; Trujillo was resorted to have milked

the Dominicon Rerublie of $100 million, an estimate which was

probanly exaggereted and should be

scaled down by one-half or two.

thirds.

Secretary Anderson said lie understood that $4 nillion

In gold had been recently removed from lew York banks by the

Dominican Republic and had been

pleced

in the Bank of Nove Scotic.

iro iulles said he had

a detailed

report on the finuncial situ-

ation of the forinican

Republic, all the detailo of which he would

not reud.

However,

it appeared that the Doninican luablic now

neld $l5 million in gold and that it had incurred a varioty of

chligations;

for example, a $16.5 million Joan fron the Bank of

¡ova Scotia

secured by

the suger crop.

The Domintcan Republic

hed also drawn 37 million out of a $1l.5 million credit with the

International Monetary Fund.

Secretary Anderson said the Inter-

notional binetery Fund's dealings with the Doninican Republic

might present a problen to the U.s.

The Doninicen Republic now

had drawn

so much from the fund that it could only draw in the

future $2 million every 90 isys without consulting the Directors

of the Fund.

If the Dominicans

should want to draw more than

52 million every 90 days,

the question would arise es to how the

U.S. Director should vote when the Dominican Republic undertakes

the necessury consultation with the fund.

Mr. Dulles, continuing his briefing, reported that Irujillo,

apparently not reallzing its position,

1s not enticipating on

said

this government was following the situation in the Doninican

Republic closely and intended

to try to prevent selzure of power

by any pro-Castro group.

This would Irvolve working closely with

the üis.

The Vice

Fresident believed that we could not let Castro

or a pro-castro group take over the Dominican Rejublic even 1f

we had to intervene in cider to prevent

such a takeover. Mr.

Dillon felt thut

in order

to intervene we would need en invitation.

story was being repeated

in the Dominicon Repuülic; that 16,

the

pro-Castro clument wus

Jectives.

Ir. Dulles

said there

was a Ercup

in Venezuela

which

would like to move Into the Dominican Repuvlic and take over the

govertment.

Ni. Dilion belloved the Cactro elenent in the Dominican

Republic was not strong enough to assume control of the government

without support frou Cuba.

It was, accordingly, very important

that

the U.S. be prepared for rapid action.

The Vice President

agreed that it was very important that the U.S., if necessary,

take rapid action to prevent any move by Castro to seize power

in the Dominican Republic.

Mr. Dulles said

the situations in liaiti and Venezuela were

being arrected by the

Hir. Allen said USIA had been discussing meuns of presenting

factual

information to

the Cuban people.

His agency had been

under sone presoure from U.S. neuspopers und lembero ni Congreas

on

this point.

Tie Senate had recently passed a resolution allo-

cating $100,000 to be used by USIA to buy time on Florida radio

stations for procrens aimed ut

Cuba.

However, a conderence com-

altied had refused the allocation of additional noncy, sucgesting

that dunds already appropriated be used for the purpose. Studies

in USii had developed two possibilitles for getting the factual

internation to the Cuban people.

One project wouid be a 500

itlerte mobile standard-wave radio station in Florida tronomit-

cing programs beamed to Cuba.

It would tuke at luuut nine montha

and possibly up to twenty months to put this projuct, into oper-

ation.

A second project was

the proposal to fly un aircraft over

Rej nest for the purpose of beaming

television progrus into

Cliva, probably on Channel 8.

This project could be jut into

operation in nuout cigit weeks if the Navy would provide USIA

with a Super-Constellation aircraft now being used on weather

jatrol

dutles.

lowever, thie project was traught with certain

airficulties.

Inc Federal Connunicationg Committloa, although

it would

of courue cooperate if directed to do no by the fisc or

tie Fresident, wus strongly opposed to the operation because it

¡cared that the result would be a radio war in the western lemia-

there.

In any case, FCC would like to be heard before being

directed by the iS to proceed.

te. Allen pointed sut that if

lixico or Canada leanca prograns to one uf our cities from an

aircruit, we would te furious.

A similar reuction migit be ex-

restud from Castro.

Moreover, If it becane known thut we were

bronicanting on a ferticular channel,

Castro could shift his

television stutions to this channel and jum our progrunt. In

jamming 1s

so easy that Castro might retaliate uy jamuning

other U.S. stations. So much for the technical difficulties of

this problem.

There were other difficulties also.

Beaming tele-

vicion programs to Cuia from an aircraft would give Castro a plat-

form from which to denounce the U.S. for television atgression.

He could pose as a martyr,

saying he was a victim of the pover;

ful U.S. ,and ask other

Latin American countries to rally to his

defense.

In the light of all these

difriculties, USIA was

searching for elternate means of getting factual

information to

thie Cuvan people.

Cur short-wave broadcasts to Cuba have been

eugenied.

The difficulty with short-wave broadcasts is that

tiere die only about 150,000 short-wave sets in Cuba, most of

witch

were imported by Castro during ils days us " guerrilla.

Ii might be possiule for USLi to our time on

local sissions in

Florida for brondcasting Cubun programs.

The most usurul statlon

for this purpose is one orned by tir. Storer, who 10 most cooperative

and whose station has broadcast to Cube on an experarental basis.

Host radio stations do not wish to rent two or three hours of good

listening time to the USIA for Spanion-language programs because

thuj are feuriul of iosing

their regular listencis.

Air. Dillon was

inclined

to think

that any contrived

Mi. Allen agreed that vhile baseball broadcastine to Cuba nad

some attractions, 1t was not sufficiently dignified for o U.S.

proften.

Te Vice President agreed

that broadcagting from an

airplane would be counter-productive;

it would not produce

enough dererits to compensate

for its

disadvantages. The Vice

President ind no objection to

taking

action which would be bit-

terly protested by Custro provided such ction would really

which would merely irritate Castro

without producing tengible

int to his speeches: Overt action

lie also pointed out that the Internationel Telecommunicationa

In an altempt to clarify the situation with respect to the first

all aspects of the Cuban project. He said that he was at a loss to

On the second point, Mr. Dulles said that we do know a good

cited as an exampie the position that had been taken as to the inclusion

of cortain ultra-conservative groups.. He said that the Frente had

issued i statement of its aims, which he summarized very broadly

as being to preserve the principles of the cvolution. He said that as

to specific stands on restoration of U.S. property rights, elc., this

was thought to be unwise because it would give the Frente the appearance

of being a tool of the Amcricans.
