RETURN TO

Use

This is a voluntary statement offered to the Career

Panel as supplementary information for review and consideration

of an operational assignment for the undersigned. It contains

Subject's resume of service

experience,

as well as his

evaluation of qualifications and

capabilities.

It is also

submitted to provide the Panel with current thinking and

attitude of the subject, as related to

agent career

ase inent in er as teted his tino prévious tours of dity:

"Concerning service and experience:

I have spent all

my adult life in government service (Enlisted in the Field

Artillery 29 August 1940).

Twenty years of this service has

been in the intelligence field, beginning with Combat Intel-

ligence and covering Economic and Political Intelligence

while in the Air Force.

KUBARK service began in June, 1949,

in Foreign Intelligence with some Psychological Warfare and

ultimately, Paramilitary. About seventeen.

years ot this

service has been in Latin America

- (Panama (Costa Rica,) 16-15

16 Guatemala, Mexico) and Cuba - with about seven years in

different (universities.

"I believe that my qualifications and capabilities

have been utilized (as well as neglected) in a more unique

manner than in the case of the average career agent, because

in addition to speaking and living like a Latin American, I

can think like one and consequently create or inspire confidence,

identifying with their biases, ranging from sincere criticism

to active opposition to the United States.

this, naturally.

led to my specialization in the field of Communist Penetration

operations in International Communism branch, where I think

my record will speak for itself.

"It appears that Connunist Penetration operations were

well assioned and between 1949 and 1209, l gained experienco

in recruitment and manarcment of Latin Anerican Communist

agents.

During this period, I also received two courses in

Clandestine Tradecraft given by the Headquarters Covert Training

Branch.

It was my understanding that my work was above average

and indicated a flair for clandestine operations.

Later, some

of my actual case histories of penetration operations were

sterilized and reproduced as training aides in the Covert

Training Branch.

During this service, I also gained experience

in postal intercept and surveillance,

audio surveillance,

photography, and the operation of equipnent used in these

activities.

"After a four-year tour in Cuba, I volunteered to under-

take an FI mission with CASTRO's forces then in the Sierra

Maestra (April 58). The results of this mission were hailed

as satisfactory and well recorded and although I was never

really satisfied with Agency support and follow-up on this

mission, it is now buried under the Cuban situation which is

a dead lien behing much pawed over these days.

"While in Mexicoon an FI assignment, I was asked to

•Petucen March and August 1960, I processed at Head-

quarters and did some

"outside" pl work for the Cuban

dest on the deteriorating situation in Cuba. In late

August, I signed the

secrecy agreement for project JMARC

and went to Miami for "inside duty" in a KUBARK installation

for the first time.

Although quite convinced that Cuba

would "not be another Guatemala"

and that the project was

destined to fail, I reported this heresy, then suppressed

it and pitched in

to do a job that was not infrequently

praised and for which there are tangible records of production

and affect on the enemy.

This tour ended with my transfer

from JMWAVE on 15 January 1963 under inexcusable circum-

stances which are recorded in my file or last fitness report

and need not be reiterated here.

"Without going into the "growing pains" of my development

in various phases of intelligence,

and using a special

restraint on the Cuban situation, I want to make it clear

that my talents lie in the Foreign Intelligence Field.

Indeed,

I know little else or have worked at little else

in my life.

If I may

be permitted some insight in my case,

I am mid-way in a career which has yet to yield the best

twenty years of service, and would be of such mutual con-

venience to government

and individual that it would be un-

fortunate if this/

problem were permitted to destroy

it or render it non-operational.

"At the same time, I am cognizant of KUBARK forbearance

in this matter, and that my statements, vows or promises as to

future conduct cannot be valid unless proven by time and

performance:

Recognizing that such a probationaly period

is a requisite before approval can be obtained for an FI

assignment in WH, I would suggest an interim Headquarters

duty of minimum duration, preferably within the Task force,

(SAS) where my current knowledgeability might be more

productive.

"To support this request, the following is submitted

for consideration:

Finally, let there be no misunderstanding on this

point, I

am fully aware that this is a crucial phase

the point of indulgence.

The terms of the career agent

contract are clear. Should this problem arise again to

affect an operational assignment, I will offer my

resignation

accepted at the

convenience of the

government."
