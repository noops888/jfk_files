For the benefit of Washington Field Office referenced

airtels contained information furnished to the New York

office by ARNOLD RAYBER, Brooklyn, N. Yo

who was contacted by JOSEPH MEROLA In 9/56 In connection

with purchasing large quantities of arms and ammunition

for the cuban rebellion.

The most important disclosure

by RAYBER was information dealing with CHARLES COLLE,

owner and operator of the Millville Weapons Corp., in

Union, N. J.

RAYBER reported that COLLE knew where he

could purchase part of the Canton Armory loot and

claimed it would be necessary to meet the seller of the

weapons in Washington;

D. C.

RAYBER turned this Informa

tion over to the Alcohol

and Tobacco Tax Division soon

after he talked with COLLE but nothing further developed

and it is only recently that the New York Office

discovered this situation.

For the benefit of New York and Newark, Pittsburgh has

not made any recent arrests in the ToP category

involving persons' or weapons described by RAYBER's

source of information.

The only arrest RAYBER's source

might have referred to involves the apprehension of

Pittsburgh Top Hoodlum SAM MANNARINO On 7/2/59 in the

case captioned, "BERNARD J. EZHAYA; etal - ITSP - MT."

MANNARINO WaS

taken into custody by Bureau Agents in

his office at

the Ken Iron and Steel Co., a scrap yard

in New Kensington, Pa.

The location of

the arrest 1s

pointed out since RAYBER's source mentioned one of the

people near the

alleged weapons shipment worked in a

quarry.

As a matter of information weapons stolen from the

aid not have the

Thompson submachine guns or flame throwers

taken during

the burglary.

Consequently, the Ml rifles

seen by

RAYBER's source may or may not be part of the armory

weapons.

PG 52-1687

Because of the uncertainty of the situation at present

Pittsburgh is not in the position to advise the New York

office as to the action to be taken by RAYBER, although

close contact should be maintained with him in the

future.

In the event RAYBER develops information

through his source that will identify the shipment in

question as part of the Armory loot, It will be

necessary to contact the Bureau before deciding upon a

particular course of action to be taken.

The situation regarding CHARLES COLLE, however, should

be the subject of immediate investigation in view of

his disclosure to RAYBER about being able to meet the,

seller of the Canton Armory weapons in Washington, D. C.

Since RAYBER says, COLIE disclosed this information

approximately one month after RAYBER's original

contact with MEROLA in New York City, the date would be

somewhere between 10/24 and 10/26/58. It is recalled

that on 10/26/50, SUTOR made his first flight aus, oi

the Allegheny Valley Airport presumedly with the first

load of weapons stolen from the Armory in Canton..

Newark,

New York and Washington Field Office should note

the lollowing sequence of events since they appear to

indicate the strong possibility that COLLE may have met

with SAM MANNARINO in Washington, D. C., sometime in

late 10/58. Miami Office has developed Information that

S. MARINO, not further described, but who is undoubtedly

Identical with SAM MANNARINO, was aboard Eastern Airlines

Flight No. 985 on 10/24/58 from Washington, D. Co, to

Miami, Fla.

This flight left Washington at 10:10

and arrived In Miami at 1237AM., 10/25/38T6 10,

important to note that on 10/25/58, at 1:36 A.M., SAI

MANN who has

been positively identified as SAM

MANNARINO registered at the Sea Gull Hotel In Miami

Beach, Fla.

Miami has pointed out that there is a

59 minute differential between the arrival of MARINO

in Miami™

on Eastern Airlines and the check-in time

SAL MANN. at the Sea Gull Hotel.

Miami points out that

Photographs of subjects under indictment in this case

and the photograph of SAM MANNARINO should be shown to

COLLE and every effort should be made to obtain a

signed statement fully identifying the person

he was

to meet in washington, D. C..

New York is asked to re-contact ARNOLD RAYBER; display

enclosed photographs and in addition determine

whether COLLE gave RAYBER any indication that he

followed through on the meeting with the seller In

Washington D. C. Suairtel results Newark

Miami - AUSA DANIEL SNYDER, Western District of

Pennsylvania, has advised that he considers it quite

important that Miami continue efforts to have JOE

MEROLA brought face to face with CHARLES F. SMITH.

Consequently Miami Is asked to carry out this objective

at the earliest possibly date.and If SMITH has no

objection by the most direct method possiblt. Miami

JOHN KERNAN, manager, and JAMES T. YERBY, night

auditor, Sea Gull Hotel, Miami Beach, fla, IOr

submission to the FBI laboratory in order that they

may be compared with the handwriting on Registration

Card No. 1908 in the name of Mr. SAL MANN, Brooklyn,

N. Y.

It is realized that Miami cannot engage in an endless

submission of handwriting specimens although this phase

of the investigation will not be completed until all

employees of the Sea Gull who had some official

contact with the SAL MANN Registration Card have been

positively identified or eliminated.

For example

WERNER MITCHELL, a former employee now living in

Chicago, has been eliminated on the basis of handwriting

and it seems

reasonable that YERBY, the employee who

accepted the

MANN registration, should be identified

or eliminated.

KERNAN, who may have registered MANN

despite his statements

to the contrary should be

identified or eliminated. This investigation 1s
