Ricardo contacted Legat approximately four times

after initial visitland on two occasions furnished Legat

data

on members

of Cuban Embassy which were obviously

obtained from DISIP files]e()

On 9/30/76, Ricardo appeared unannounced at American

Embassy and requested assistance in obtaining a visa to U.S.

since he had a photographic assignment for "Vision" Magazine

in Jamaica and planned a two-day stopover in Puerto Rico.

Ricardo stated that he intended to leave on 10/1/76 and

since a travel agency told him the visa process would take

three days, requested Legat's assistance. U

*Review of Ricardo's passport reflected that Ricardo

8/29/76,

recalled that the bombing of the Guyanese Consulate in

Port-of-Spain had occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m.,

on 9/1/76, and wondered in view of Ricardo's association

with louis Posada, if his presence there during that period

was coincidence.

(CORU publicly claimed credit for this

attack.) Legat informed Chief, Nonimmigrant Visa Section

(NIVS), he wished no special consideration for Ricardo, and

requested the issuance of a visa to him be considered on its

own merits.

On 10/1/76, at the request of Ricardo, Legat communicated

with Vice Consul who wished to know if Legat

believed Ricardo

would return to Venezuela after his visit in the U.S., or if

he was likely to remain there illegally. Legat informed the

Vice Consul he had no reason to believe Ricardo would not

return to Caracas. 4

in a conversation with an olliclal of DIsIP on 10/1/16,

Legat broached the subject of Ricardo and of the faint suspicion

that Ricardo may have been somehow involved in the bombing of

the Guyanese

Consulate in Port-of-Spain.

The DISIP official

related DISIP hadino reason to believe Ricardo was the caliber

of individual that would be utilized in such an operation and

than Ricardo was not knows to be involved " such activities

in spite of his association with Posada. f

a Federal fugitive from the U.S., wanted for parole violation.

He was originally sentenced to a ten-year prison term in 1968

on charges relating to conspiracy, extortion and bombings.

On

12/19/72, Bosch was paroled after

serving four years.

Following

an interview with a news reporter in which he publicly admitted

sending letter bombs to Cuban Embassies, the U.S. Parole Board

issued a warrant for his arrest. Bosch

thereafter went

underground (Sm)

LOn 10/9/76, Venezuelan President Perez was contacted by

American Ambassador, Caracas, andfurged to deport Bosch. Perez

advised that Bosch had entered Venezeula clandestinely,

but was

now providing, intormation on the Chilean

Junta to the venezeular

Government. Perez stated thatpBosch claims to have carried out

several terrorist acts for the Chileans but was no longer in

their employ. Perez related Showever, that Guillermo Novo Sampol

and Ignacio Novo Sampol, two anti-Castro Cuban exiles living in

the U.s., are still working with the Chileans, and, in fact,

engineered the Letelier killing.

DISIP was informed

then that Bosch, as an alien, would not be permitted reentry

into the U.S. @this decision was concurred in by Department of

State and Department of Justice

Further Reports on CORU Involvemen

MM 1337-S, a CORU member, was told telephonically

on 10/6/76, by a Puerto Rican CORU member,.

that CORU was

cesponsible for the bombing of captioned airliner. Also,

source was contacted telephonically on 10/7/76, by CORU leader,

Frank Castro, who was then in the Dominican Republic. Castro

told source

that CORU should delay any news release regarding

this incident until public reaction can be assessed. Source

On 10/8/76, an anonymous female caller to the"'

Miami

Herald", daily newspaper took credit for the crash of the

Cuban Airliner in

the name of CORU. U

"El Condor" Organization Claims Credit

On 10/6/76, the "Miami Herald" received a telephone

call at 10 p.m., froman individual who said the "El Condor"

organization was responsible for placing the bomb.

This

call was received after extensive news coverage of the crash.U

There is no known "El Condor" organization in the Miami,

Florida, area, and the only previous use of the name "El Condor"!

to claim credit for terrorist activities was by anti-Castro

Cuban terrorist, Rolando Otero in "Military Communiques," he

issued after several bombings in Miami in December, 1975.

Otero is in jail in Miami awaiting trial on these charges. U

This claim is believed to be without substance;

however, it has caused Caribbean countries to speculate freely

that anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami were responsible for

the crash of the airliner.
