Ricardo contacted Legat approximately four times
after initial visit{and on two occasions furnished Legat
data on members. of Cuban Embassy which were ooo
obtained from DISIP files |g)

On 9/30/76, Ricardo appeared unannounced at American
Embassy and requested assistance in obtaining a visa to U.S,
since he had a photographic assignment for "Vision" Magazine
in Jamaica and planned a two-day stopover in Puerto Rico,
Ricardo stated that he intended to leave on 10/1/76 and
since a travel agency told him the visa process would take
three days, requested Legat's assistance. |d

Feview of Ricardo's passport reflected that Ricazido
had traveled from Caracas to Port-of-Spain, Trini ,» on
8/29/76, and had returned to Caracas on aire pate
recalled that the bombing of the Guyanese Consulate in
ay Port-of-Spain had occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m.,
on 9/1/76, and wondered in view of Ricardo's association
with Imis Posada, if his presence there during that period
was coincidence. (CORU publicly claimed credit for this |
attack.) Legat informed Chief, Nonimmigrant Visa Section
(NIVS), he wished no special consideration for Ricardo, and
requested the issuance of a visa to him be considered on its

Department of State (DOS) Reaction
Since the escalation of CORU terrorist activities,
DOS has sought the deportation of Bosch first from Nicaragua,
and now, because of this incident, from Venezuela. Boschis

“a Federal fugitive from the U.S., wanted for parole violation.
He was originally sentenced to a ten-year prison term in 1968
on charges relating to conspiracy, extortion and bombings. On
12/19/72, Bosch was paroled after serving four years. Following
an interview With a news reporter in which he publicly admitted
sending letter bombs to Cuban Embassies, the U.S. Parole Board
issued'a warrant for his arrest. Bosch thereafter went
underground (= ha)

Con 10/9/76, Venezuelan Pregident Perez was contacted by ‘
American Amb: dor, Caracas, anificged to deport Bosch. erez, :
advised that! sch had entered Venezeula clandestinely, but was i
now providing, information on t Chilean Junta to the Venezeulan
Government. [Perez stated tha josch claims to have carried out
several terrorist acts for the Chileans but was no longer in
their employ. [Perez related nowever, that Guillermo Novo Sampol
and Ignacio Novo Sampol, two anti~Castro Cuban exiles living in
the U.S., are still working with the Chileans, and, in fact,
engineered the Letelier killing. (This information had i
previously been reported by confidential source, Morales H
Navarrette, and similar information linking the Novo brothers |
with Letel "s killing has been received from other’ sources.) :
Perez made decision on deporting Bosch, (Saying that while {
ie understood the concern of the U.S. Government, he would i
study the matter and meet again with U.S. officials on 10/11/75) a

Legat, Caracas, briefing Ambassador, Caracas/regarding |

bitterly that the U.S, had requested the deportation of Bosch H

Further Reports on CORU_ Involve:

MM 1337-S, a CORU member, was: told telephonically
on 10/6/76, by a Puerto Rican cORU member, that CORU was
responsible for the bombing of captioned airliner. Also,
source was contacted telephonically on 10/7/76, by CORU leader,
Frank Castro, who was then in the Dominican Republic, Castro
told source that CORU should “delay | any news release regarding
this incident until public reaction can be assessed. Source
said no one from Miami or Puerto Rico is, known to be involved
in the bombing of the Cuban Airliner. Y/t)

On 10/8/76, an anonymous female caller to the Miami
Herald". daily newspaper took credit for the crash of the
Cuban Airliner in the name of CORU. \

"El Condor" or anization Claims Credit

On 10/6/76, the "Miami Herald" received a telephone
call at 10 p.m.,fronan individual who said the "El Condor"
organization was responsible for placing the bomb. This
call was received after extensive news coverage of the crash dl

Thére is no known "El Condor" organization in the Miami,
. Florida, area, and the only previous use of the name "El Condor"
to claim credit for terrorist activities was by anti-Castro
Cuban terrorist, Rolando Otero in "Military Communiques," he
issued after several bombings in Miami in December, 1975.
Otero is in jail in Miami awaiting trial on these charges. Uu

This claim is believed to be without substance;
however, it has caused Caribbean countries to speculate freely
that ‘anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami were responsible for
the crash of the airliner.
