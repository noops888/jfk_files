MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Operations Staff

SUBJECT

:.

Review of Agency Holdings regarding

Photograph of Unidentified Indiviaual

in Mexico City published by the

Warren Commission

REFERENCE

Letter dated 15 April 1975 by

David W. Belin, Executive Director

of the Commission

on CIA Activities

within the United States, to

Mr. E. Henry Knoche (copy attached to

accompanying report)

1.

This is further to, and in completion of, my

interim memorandum of a few weeks ago.

The attachment is a detailed review in narrative,

chronological order - together with appropriate comment-

ary - of our extensive holdings on the OSWALD case that

have a bearing on the matter of photographs taken by

Mexico City Station on j, 4, and 15, October 1963 of an

Unidentified Individual.

As a consequence

of a combina-

tion of analytical error, misjudgement and under the

stress of an urgent desire to contribute to the develop-

ment of the investigation of the assassination, a

cropped versior of one of the photographs of the

Unidentified Individual was introduced into the chain of

evidence in the OSWALD case on 23 November 1963 by an

FBI representative in Dallas.

The successive vicissi

tudes which have now made this event a cause celebre

right down to the present moment are detailed in the

narrative.

The attached report

is not intended to be an

answer to the Fensterwald/O'Toole article which Mr. Belin

attaches to his memorandum.

(I have prepared a paragraph-

by-paragraph refutation and comment on that article,

which I believe is more appropriately handled by a sepa

rate memorandum to Mr. Belin, and I will prepare this as

a memorandum if that is desired.)

The point of the referenced memorandum is that

consideration should be given now to "whether or not the

entire matter can be fully disclosed at this time." This

submission is designed to make it possible for you, the

IG and others whom you may desire to consult to make this

decision.

The narrative-interpretive summary has been

put together in such a way that it discloses no cyptonyms.

his representative review the documentation that backs up

The documentation has not been keyed into

5. As noted above, one of the photographs taken in

on 4 October 1963 was introduced into the

Warren Commission public record.

However, it was intro

duced into that record in two

cropped versions.

Warren Commission and its staff were made fully aware in

fille

the course of their inguiry at Headquarters and in

Mexico City of the origins of the photograph, the fact

that we had additional photographs of the same individual

taken at different times in Mexico City and on the basis

of full knowledge of these facts reached their own con-

clusions regarding the irrelevance of the photograph to.

graphs of the Unidentified Individual.

had indicated in writing to Chief, CIOPS,

that he has no

objection for MI. Belin to do whatever is desired with

these photographs at this time.

It should be noted that

Mr. Fensterwald

in 1971 - 1972 was actually shown, by

Mr. Houston during a visit to the Agency, two of the

twelve photographs, other than the one already published

in the Warren Commission report. (It is these two that

he has published in The New York Review of Books article

which Mx. Belin attaches to his memorändum.)

It seems to me that whoever makes a decision on

whether the entire matter can be

time should bear in mind that a subsidiary decision must

also be made, 1.e., whether to crop or otherwise fuzz up

the background of the photographs or, alternatively, to

publish the entire run of the photographs for the first

time without taking out the background.

Obviously, none

of these questions apply to the passage of this material

to Mr. Belin and the Rockefeller Commission

itself.

think they should see the entire documentation as

stands.

Perhaps after that, the question of what could

be discussed and the question of "how?" and "how much?"

could be taken up with Mr. Belin himself.

My personal

recommendation is that the more we can

say about this

matter in a fully open and final manner, the better off

we will be as an Agency.

But it is my understanding

that there are still sensitive aspects deriving from

fact that the operation which produced the photographs

was jointly rin with Mexican liaison and as a consequence

• publication at this time would create additional problems

at that level in Mexico.

Also, it should be noted that

the Ambassador,

according to Win Scott's memorandum

J.C. King

22 November 1963 (see Item 8 in the backup

documentation), allegedly played a direct role in the

with the State Department about that aspect of the matter.
