is away on business from time to time. In that connection,
you should arrange with the householder to be advised of any
inquiries concerning the Subject and you should: then notify
Headquarters promptly. Also, it is an unlikely possibility
that the Immigration and Naturalization Service may direct

December 1964. It will be needed for an indefinite period
of time and when circumstances permit Headquarters will notify

1. hile it is possible for Headquarters te obtain 2

fally backstopyed address in ZR¥ETAL for aAmsguG/1 alias
documentation, it ig believed that auch an edédreas in JMWAVE
would be more advantsgeous for the folloving reasons:

A. It hag been the experience in similar cages
that certsin consulates will NOT issue visas to their
countries to persons applying for them in one city and
holding passperta and I-94 forms showing permanent or even
temporary addreases in enother city.

B. Tho fect that subject resides in the WAVE area
ghould pose no particular problem in his being
backstopped in alies in the same city. For example,
A9MUG/1 resided in true neme in the ZRHETAL area and
at the same time was bacxstopped in aliss in the same
aren.
