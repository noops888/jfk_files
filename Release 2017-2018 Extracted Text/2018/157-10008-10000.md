FITZGERALD. rsaid that AMLASH dwelt constantly on the fact that "he could not

solution to the problem; while, on the other hand, the US Government gave much equipment
and money to exile roups for their ineffective excursions against Cuban coastal targets,
According to CAMasi} feels strongly on this point, and if he does not get
advice and materials from a U.S. Government technician, he wil probably become fed up
