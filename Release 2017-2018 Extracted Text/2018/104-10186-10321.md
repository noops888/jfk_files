The Director’

The director general of the DGE is Manuel PINELRO Losada, known
as “Red Beard”, (Barba Roja).4 He is closely associated with
Radiro VALVES, to whom he has direct access at any time; he is
required to report regularly te Fidel CASTRO and to coordinate
with him all expenditures of large sumsi and he also has direct
contact with GUEVARA, Raul CASTRO often visits PINEIRO's office;
his principal interest appears to be the guerrilla schools (see
below), but he may have others in the DGI. PINEIRO also handled
the principal contacts with the Soviet advisors of the DGI. His
direction ef the DGI is handled through a deputy, but he also
has direct contact as desired with department chiefs and lower~
level personne]: chiefs of field stations report directly to him,
although other field-station business is handled through the
departments responsible for. field work. PINEIRO himself has
trained some important agents in field work and has subsequently
acted ag.their handling officer.

PINEIRO has his office in his residence at dist Avenue and

isth Street in the Miramar district of Habana. There he keeps
funetional files of everything concerning the DGI: other files
from individual sections are brought to him for review and then
returned to the department or section that maintains them,

There is a daily courier service between his house and the DGI
headquarters, The house h at least two separate telephones,
one personal and one official, the latter proviaing direct com-
munication with all,government agencies, One of the telephone
uabers is 29-1257.5 The outside entrance of the house always
has two guards in olive-green uniforms; they are probably from
the DSE. In addition, PINEIRO has a bodyguard staff of six, also
protably from the DSE, Three of them are always, with him on 24-
hour shifts! one acts as chautfeur when he goes out, while the
othee two follow in a second car, He keeps three cars, all 1961
Oldsmobiles, one blue, one beige, and one black,

In his home office PINEIRO has an aide, pseudonym “castor,"6 whe
handles the office work but does not attend private interviews.
In Cuba he stays in the office and does not accompany PINEIRO
outside the office. When PINEIRO travels abroad, "Castor" ac-
companies him, as for example on his visit to Moscow in April
4. At the main DGI headquarters, PINEIRO also has a secre-
tary, pseudonym "Vidalina." and a clerk-typist. pseudonym
“Zoraida"; they occupy desks in the executive office of the DGI
deputy chief but work strictly for PINEIRO, "Vidalina” handles
all incoming and outgoing correspondence and cable traffic and
distributes it both within DGI headquarters and abroad.

DGI Main Headquarters.

The main headquarters of the directorate is known as “Department
M" of the Ministry of Interior. but very few people know any~
thing about it or are even aware of its existeice. It occupies

a house and grounds which were formerly the property of the GOMEZ
Mena tanily. {t covers a whole city block bvounded by 49th and
Sist Avenues and 78th and SUth Streets in the Larrazabal section
of the Marianao suburb of Habana, The block is « compound sur-
rounded by a concrete wall, sith trees planted completely around
it inside, There are two catrances: a main entrahce with wooden

gates located near the center of the block on 80th Street and a
back entratice with steel doors located directly through the
block on 78th Street. The main entrance is manned by guards
armed with PPShA machineguns: the rear entrance is kept locked
and is used only in emergencies, No pass or ideaééfication is

required to enter the grounds.

The headquarters compound (sce diagram on page 15) contains all
the DGI offices except PINEIRO's home office, the three opera-
tional departrents. and the Special Schools Department, described
below. The main building. called M Building, is situated near
the center of the compound but off the main axis between the.
gates. It houses most of the offices in its twé stories and, also
contains a canteen, public teiephones, and a police radio for the
city and the Ministry..of Interior. There are no large assembly
rooms; conferences are held in small rooms. Within the compound,
separated from M Building by driveways and parking lots, are
several other structures:

a, A twyestory building housing the Personnel Department on the |

first floor and the Inspection Department on the second.

b. Three one-story service buildings: a guard office with
sleeping quarters for 20 to 25 guards, a food-storage ware-
house, and a clothing-storage warehouse. The guard office
and the Personnel-Inspection building flank the main entrance

on 80th Street,

ce. A two-story building, in the angle of the grounds formed by
78th Street and 49th Avenue, housing the Technical Operational
Support Department. Two of its sections, the Photographic
Laboratory and the Concealment Device Section, occupy indi-
vidual buildings in the compound,

General administration of the DGI is handled from the M Building.
where PINEIRO's deputy, (fnu) CHAIN,7 pscudonym "Agusto," has
his office, Besides acting as director general when PINEIRO is
away from Cuba, CHAIN is responsible specifically for management
of large expenditures, South Anterican affairs, and the approval
of false passports for travelers. He signs, in pseudonym, all
notices and circulars issued to the directorate, His secretary
has the pseudonym. "Georgina." CHAIN's office, through "Vidalina,
distributes cable traffic to the DGI departments, Incoming and
outgoing cable traffic and diplomatic pouck traffic are received
at this. office from the Central Ciphering Service (Servicio
Central de Cifrados - SCC), which is a communal coding and de~
coding service operated by the DSE. CHAIN's office apparently
also acts as a receiving and distributing center for clandestine
radio traffic but does not itself send or receive radio messages;
the actual transmission is possibly controlled by the Communist

Party.

Directly under the deputy director are two admin
ments for staff members, Personnel (De!

building in the headquarters mpound. The Personnel Department,
headed by pseudonym "Pelayo." which handles all matters concerning
staff member administration (selection, hiring, pay, promotion.
dismissal, social security, ete.), has about 14 or 15 menbers.

OF the eight departments making up the headquarters, three are
operational, four ave concerned with operational support er
training, and one is administrative. The three operational de
partments are Legal Centers (Centres Legales = MS). Mlegal
(egak), and National Liberation (liberacion Nacional - LN);

the last two were formerly a single department, known as MAU
(Intelligence). All three departments handle operations abroad
for the purpose of collecting information on the -host country,
promoting Cuban political aims, and conducting subversive ac-
tivities. Their operations are distinguished by tuo factors,
Jegal connections and Communist Party-lefUst group Liaison,

The Departmwat of Legal Centers is responsible for operatioas
conducted through Cuban official missions in countries with which
Cuba has diplomatie relations and has normally nothing to do with
illegal agent The other two departments handle illegal agents,
both in countries with which Cuba has relations and in those with
which she has none. The Illegal Department has no connection
with Communis or organized leftist! groups abroad: the
National Liberadien Department deals mainly with such parties
and groups: the Department of Legal Ceuters may work with them
ov-unilatevally, ALL three departments are organized in geo-
raphteal divisions with area desks for each country within
their respective fields or responsibility; there is thus some
overlapping in desk coverage.

distinct from guerrilla warfare operations covered below in

In countries with which Cuba docs not have diplomatic relations,
DGE activities are handled by agents stationed permanently in

the country as illegal agents or as members of Communist Parties

and leftist groups. Their assignments are sabotage. subversion,
selgction and training of guerrilla warfare candidates and other ’
agents or groups in Latin America primarily, The DGL regards
Guatemala and Venezuela as the countries tn which {ts operations

have been most successful. Such f4eld operations are run from

Cuba or from an adjacent country.

Cuba has diplomatic relations or where she maintains commercial

noted above, report directly to PINEIRO; the MS Department takes
care of all paper work for the field stations, including photo-

Operational Support Departments.

The uperational support’ departments of the PGI are Technical
Operational Support (MI). [llegal Centers (30). Special Schools

(EE), and Information Services (SI). They handle such functions
AS spotting prospective agents, providing operational inforzation,
training both intelligence agents and guerrillas, providing clan-
destine communications between headquarters and agents in the
field, procuring operational funds and supplies, ete.

lection and agent candidate spotting department. It has three
major responsibilities: collection of information from foreigners
visiting Cuba; assessment of visiting foreigners for candidates
for intelligence agents; and screening of letters from abroad
volunteering information, both to extract-any Useful data and to
assess the writers as possible candidates for intelligence use.
Among visiting foreigners, the MO Department dues not concern it-
self with diplomats, they are left to the DSE, nor with foreigners
who are established residents of Cuba, who are the responsibility
of the Colonial Bureau (see below). In debriefing foreign visi-
tors, the department often works through ICAP, which makes arrange-
ments for many visits to Cuba; in many instances, the visitors
supply information unwittingly and are never aware that they are
in contact with Cuban intelligence. The MO Department does not
itself recruit agents; it only watches for, screens, and evaluates
foreign contacts as ayent candidates. If the persons it sclects
are members of a Communist Party o- leftist organization, they
are referred to the LN Department: if they are not members of
such groups, they are referred to the Illegal Department; one’

of those two units does the actual recruiting.

support, outside the operational department framework; and con-
tinues to process technical communications for the departmepts
after the agents ‘have gone into the field, It has, however,
nothing to do with the direction of agents; it is only a training
and support mechanism, The MI Department also does not supply
equipment, for example, for clandestine raaio communication,

but tells agents what to procure and lets them make their. own
purchases in their home countries with funds supplied by ‘the
operational department directing them, Ay the main technical
department of the DGI, MI has most of the directorate's tech-
nical equipment, which it services and repairs in its own es-

of Cuban intelligence services begun with the establishment of
the Ministry of Entertor in June L961 and continued for several
months thereafter. At Chat time all Cuban intelligence agencies
were put under the new civilian ministry. and the former G-2
overall intelligence organization, which under military con-
trol, -also was civilfanized as the Department of State Security
(SE), The internal and exter intelligence services were ap-
parently separated at that time; previously they had both been

handled by G-2.

Other aspects of the DGI such as operations will be discussed
in subsequent reports.

Ramiro VALDES has been head. of Cuban intelligence since 1959;
before June 1961 he was head of G-2. but with the establishment

of the Ministry of Interior he was appointed minister, He has-
continued to devote special attention to iatelligence activities

in that capacity.
