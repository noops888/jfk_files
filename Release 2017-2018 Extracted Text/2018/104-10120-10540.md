he Except for item 3-A the above points could te ‘construed as having a
CI conotation f.e.:

A. . Subject appears to be receiving funds from some outside source.

<n the other hand a controled and racruited/source reports that. Subject
receives money from his father; that Subject who is probably a Jew himself is
cognizant of anti-semitism in the Soviet Union and that he has made disparaging
remarks about the Soviet regime. Further, the Soviets are known to te very

5S. We believe that during the developmental phase, the case officer
should attempt to create an apening for Subject to voluntarily bring up his
meeting and/or relationship with ABARCHALIN. A voluntary statement would
appear to resolve to a considerable degree any negative questions concerning
this meeting. Should Subject fail to bring the meeting out then the, patter
would have to be resolved through the LCFLUTTER which would probabl; ispen-
able to full exploitation of this case's potential. i

6. I£ you concur with the foregoing on receipt of POA we shall advise
the field to attempt an appraach as stated above.
