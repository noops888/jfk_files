GENERAL REMARKS

This man shows complete lack of any
leadership qualifications and it is extremely
doubtful whether he would develop any a@uwins
training, His experience in the French 4
and in France after the fall, as “ell as his
French background, should be used in some
capacity and it is suggested, therefore, that he
would be more sited as a subordinate merber of &
@ coup-de-main party, a

POLITICAL NOTES:

= c: on aa
The mission of. Jed Team MERK was not political. However, in ot
France it is impossible to disassociate politics rrom the militery.: ©

1. There is no political union in France.

2. Most Comite de Liberation formed, are socialist and comunist.'

%. Under pressure of the CDL the FFI has, in meny pieces, given’
way to the FIPF. E

4, The Movement de Liberation National is trying to unite with
the Front Netioual; both keezing their sharters and working togethe: ‘2

&. General de Gaulle is losing populerity in many corners of |
France. Reasons: . :

a. Food situations. have not changed and in: some places
ere worse.

be Viony laws are still enforced.

ce. No unity.
REMARKS),

France has been occupied partially’ for four yeare end total):
for two yeers.
