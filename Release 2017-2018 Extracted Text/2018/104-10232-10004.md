Dy. MIRO remarked that over & month age ho had made a request
to Clark for arme for the anti-Caatro insurgents in the Hecambray, but
to date had heard fething relative to the Fequest, He commented wryly,
“I agk but nover hear an answer," He said that the fightors there should

*Report turned over to Thompson on 6 October.

el


oun.
Dr. LARC said there wae no way to determine the accuracy
ef tho figures given of planes, guns, etc. received from the Soviet bloc
(ond Maly and Canada) but even if the figures were exaggeratod 100 per
font, thoy would etill ba impressive.

He added that Castro to daily becoming stronger militarily
with weapone and with a large militia of close to 300, 060 deing trained
to uve them while the economy contiauee to deteriorate, Perhaps only
Ralf the militia would be effective. Dut that is slseable, Thus, he said,
the longer the delay §n positive military action to overthrow Castro, the
greater will be the task. "We must act goon, vigorously and effectively,
fo ineure vistory. Anothor defeat would be disastrous and would make
Cabano, iatia Arsertcane and othore belleve Castro to be invincidte,
Thon would come accommodations and even worse, tho fraplanting of
Castro-bached regimes in ths hoouophere. And the U. S. would ouffer
Poret af all, being discredited for defeat and “guilt of interforence.
“In tho UN no nation would stand beside the U. S.”*

6. FEropozal that Council a2 to Cuba with Commando Group and

stablish a Government on Cuban Soil
Dr. MIRO then declared that he was convinced that Castre

would never be overthrown by all the propaganda, the sabotage, commando

raide, guerrilla activities, Fupture of diplomatic relations and doteriorating

economy, and that it waa inconceivable to establish a goveramont-mexile

for nothing would ¢- me of it; that the only solution for defeating tho

Castro regime was for the Revolutionary Couacil to go to Cuba and estab-

lsh a yovernmert on Cuban soll, ask recognition by all friendly countries

and mflitary aaslatance of its principal ally, the U. 4., and that the U.S,

be ready to intervene immediately with Its Forces. This would all have

t take place in a mattor of 49 houra, otherwieo it would fail. 1 Fecognize

shat this {9 8 bold plan, but boldnoes io necessary, There will be roany

risks, many may be killed, As for myoelf, I don't caro if I die. Thave

fest all my peroona! possoestena and my aon is a prisoner," He rejtorated

that all muat be well propared in advance, there mat be no vaciNation,

Svorything must proceed rapidly, First, a comciaado raid in force to

seize a plece of Cuban territory, preferably near Cuantanamo, and inmnes

diately the members of the Council yo ashore, proclaim = provisional

Bovorament, broadcast by radio to all nations an appeal for recognition

{end cables prepared in advance would algo bo cent out), request U, 5,

Aseistance, aod the U, $. should furcish uch agoistance at onco in ade-

quate strength to onaure vietory,


Before such an acticn ta undertaken, the enemy must be
goftaned by propaganda, sabotage, raida, underground action, and the
moss of tha paople of Cuba must be prepared te accept the provisional
Soverument through propaganda, increased knowledge of tho Council
and ite unifying efforts,

Dr, MIRO asked me what I thought of this project; did I think
that Castro could be overthrown tn any other way. Ladroitted that
Strong military action appoared necessary. ‘I otated farther that
of ¢ourao his plan would have to be studied at the highest government
levels. He proposod that ho mizht elaborate a plan with his military
collaborators, and I suggested that ho do thie eo that it might be examined

and considered,

Dr. MIRO declared that he 88 Convinced that this Communtot
dagger in the side of the States could only be eradicated by euch action,
that the U.8. to ond will be blamed fsr at! anti-Castro Propaganda,
abotage, etc. and that enemy ctateo will denounce it for latervontion
in Cubs, but that Uf the UL £. 298 to the ald of a friendly revolutionary
Fogime established ia the country and holga it defeat the Sovtet-backed
Communist regime, atl friendly governments will applaud,

“f have no personal political ambitions, declared MIRO,
“I merely am trying to chair the Council, whose miesicn is to unify the
anti-Castro clemeate inside and outside of Cuba. If the team ion't con-
sidered effoctive, then change the pitcher, But 1 believe the Council must
establiah ttscif on Cuban ou!l, and seen, Time is against as. "The . unta
del Eete agreement will batifire aveinst the U. 8. uf Castro ie allowed
fo romain fn Cuba, Ina year, after the politicos of the countries ra-
colving U. 3. aid have gotten their hands on U. 5. gold, they will say,
‘Thaoke to Cactro, wo got this.’ And they wil) Spend it ag in tho past
with no benefits to the social and economic welfare of the People,”

7. Views about the Judges and Lowy:

I queried Dr. MIRC as to his views relative to the Judges and
lawyers and their futare ctatus. He eaid he hoped that they eoald all
Founite and that they could be zivon assistance ns in the past. He dee
clared that Dr. ALABAY waa not Qualified to be a justice and that he.was
doing acthing but making politics and trying to discredit the Council
and MIRC and VARGNA, Dr, .URO declared that he, as Prime Minister
in the early days of the Castro government, had named ’ LABAU to the

Judicial position,

and awaited thelr reply,

He would also Ike to have the Workers, Students, and the
Professionals (Doctors, Lawyers, etc.) come into the Council. He be-
Heves Batistianos and Comunistas and elements unwilling to cooperate
should be excluded, but that all other groups should be brought together
under the Council,

He contends that all anti-Castro activities, ept clandestine

and military, ‘should be coordinated by mombers of the Council, but that
the excepted activities should be known only to him (MIRO),

9. Probable Argentine Rupture of Relations with Cuba

Dr, MIRO declared that he belleved imminent the Argentino
rupture of rolations with Cuba. He oaid the Argentine Ambassador to
Cuba (Julio AMOF DO) «za ordored to return to Havana (he had been

inasmuch a9 some Argontino action against Cuba appoared imminent.
(FERNANDE Z said he had already written MIRU a letter.) MIRO says,
“Of course, cannot go. Ihave the Consojo meeting un the 10th.

and atructure of the Propaganda Commission, He etated that it ie out~
side the Consejo and net uuder his diract control, although the Counell
accountant has been passing funds to it. Ho sald CATZRILLO had resigned

it. He claimed that MESTRE had not dona anything with propaganda,

12, MIRO‘ Views Relative to Supreme Court Juatice or PRIO
being Kecognised as Head of a Provisional Government
Tasked Dr, MIRO If he bolieved that there were many anti-
Castro Cubans (both ta and out of Cuba) who favored PRIG, o7 the head
of the Supreme Court to be the provisional president if a government were
to be established on Cuban soll. Dr. MIRO declared that the revolution

{ig a fact, and that practically nobody wants to go back to any former
regime. The people in Cuba would resist any such possibility, He do-


C

ORY

nounced PRIO's activitica against the Council and ite efforts to unify
tho anti-Castro elements. He enid that the people should be given an
opportunity to elect their chic of state aiter Castro's overthrow and

reestablishment of ordor in tho island,

13. Offices of Council (Coasejo Revoluctons rio)

When questioned about his business and private telephones,
MIRO said, “The business phone is also in my house. I have no office

except in my house, but that phone lo always busy (JEfforson 2-4680),

Se use the other phone (JEfferson 4-275!) when you wish to call me."

“I need to have a email office somewhere away from my home
because all the activitice there are driving my wile crany, I want to
find eomething modest ao that no accusation can be mate of ostentation «
merely @ room for myself, one for my secretary, and one for meetings,
of the Council, etc. Tho FRD had a place but at that place alo was the
pross, the refugee conter, ete. BR would not be eatiofactory, The FRD
ie now practically dead, BR wae the forerunacr of the Consojo as the
uaifying agency of the anti-Castro resistance,"

14, MIRO's Views oa Coordinating the Activities of Cther Exile
G

Foups

After Dr, MIRO reiterated his view that he should be the
channel for {unde and coordinating the activities of gFoups outside the
Consejo euch as the Students, FORD (Labor), ote. » Toad that I under-
Stood that sorre of these eloments were unwilling to function under the
Consejo; and that in view of that situation, did he considor that an
Activity Committee might be organised with a delegate from each of
these groupe and under the chairmanship of a member of the Consejo,
Thie would serve to coordinate their activities, give them a tie-in with
the Conzejo, yet not make them subservient to it. Dr. MIRO replied
that this would morely set up cacther Conaojo outside of and parallel to
the oxiating Consejo. I did not pursue this further, not having enough
baekgreund of these organizations to be able to discuce tho matter.

York on Cetobsr J}th or 12th for the SIP (Sociedad Interamericana de

Pronsa) meeting. 1 repiied that I would appreciate if he would contact

Clark might have a request from me for an appointment with him, if
this seamed deolzable. 1 cuggeoted that ia future phone conversations

to me,
