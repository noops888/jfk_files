ADMINISTRATIVE DATA

It has previously been reported that PH 701-C* was
@eveloped as a source of information conversant with the
daily activities of RUSSELL BUFALINO in June 1964. This informant
ceased furnishing information in October 1964. To date an
additional source has not been developed to replace this former
valuable source.

On 3/25/65 PH 752-C* was developed and it is antici-
pated this source will eventually furnish valuable information
concerning the activities of ANGELO BRUNO. This source replaced
former Philadelphia source PH 623-C# whose reliability and
productivity were well known to the-Bureau.

On 3/26/65 PH 753-C* was developed. This source
is in:a position to furnish valuable information concerning the
activities of LCN members ERNEST PERRICONE and JAMES GATTO,

PH 591-C* continues to furnish daily information on
the activities of PETER MAGGIO, Soldato of the Philadelphia
Family of LCN, who is a close confidant of ANGELO BRUNO and is
BRUNO's brother-in-law. On occasion this source has, in the
past, provided information concerning LCN of great value.

PH 734-C* was developed in December 1964 as a replace-
ment for the former-PH 571-C*, This source furnishes information
on a daily basis concerning the activities of MAX WEISBERG who
is the recognized leader of Philadelphia's "Jewish Mob." This
source has furnished considerable valuable information concerning
activities of ANGELO BRUNO and other LCN members.

PH 67@-C-TE and PH 599-C-TE, both of whom are members
of the Philadelphia Family of LCN, continue to furnish informa-
tion concerning the activities and identities of LCN members.

PH 521-C who was originally developed in 1951, is

directly Imowledgeable concerning the. activities of LON members
in the Pittston and Scranton, Pa., areas. In recent months this

informant's potential has been fully realized and he is furnishing
“information enadiling the Philadelphia. Division to precisely
determine the membership of LCN members in the Pittston and ~
Scranton areas. This informant isa son of PH 739-PC. PH 521-C
has advised he is not.a member of. "The Organization" or of LCN; '
however, his father was formerly active in "The Organization, " :
An analysis of information furnished "by PH 521-C leaves little i
room to doubt that his father, PH 739-PC,° is a member of LCN.
In view of this and in view of the fact that PH 739-PC has :
confided in his son in the past concerning membership and i
activities of "The Organization," this information is being set '
out in the body of this report insofar as individual membership :
is concerned. {

While PH 521-C is neither a highly confidential
source nor an LON member, it is believed his statements concerning
“the identities of persons holding membership in "The Organization
are sufficiently reliable to attribute LCN membership to the
persons identified as members by him.

PH 702-C* is ‘an investigative technique-used in
connection with the assignments given to PH 672-C-TE.

During. the month of April 1965, Philadelphia: sources
have advised that LCN Capodecina PHILIP. TESTA -and: ANGELO BRUNO's
close confidant PETER J. MAGGIO have both purchased’ residences in
thé Southern ‘Néw Jersey areas. The locations of these residences
have been determined and. thé’ Newark Division has’ been requested ‘
to make: every effort to develop highly confidential sources of :
information conversant with the activities at these residences.

members in his decina are "pretty old" and that PHIL TESTA
has two young members, namely, FRANK MONTE and FRANK NARDUCCI,
in his decina. |The members of TESTA's decina are "all old
men like I got." CAPPELLO complained about being a capodécina
and said there were too many headaches involved with this
position and wished he was not a capodecina. CAPPELLO said
that he would not want to be a \Boss' or "Underboss" but
would consider the position of "Consiglieri" because the
iConsiglieri" does not get too involved. CAPPELLO said a

Consiglieri is like a lawyer. In case you got a beef or
gripe or I get a beef with you he hears the Story and he 4
tries to straighten itout. Undetstand?’ '

CAPPELLO went on to say "He 28 like a lawyer. In
other words, he is like a peacemaker."

said the "Commission is nthe bosses...from different states,
from different families, the bosses of nine different families
‘.eethey've been on the commission for years and years. Like

there.,.he's one, There is CARLO GAMBINO, there is TOMMY
