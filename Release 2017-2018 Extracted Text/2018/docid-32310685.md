: Three copies of instant report are being designated
for the Miami and NY Divisions in the event of subsequent
prosecution. Ee

By communication dated 11/8/65, the Miami Division
advised that MM 1003-C-TE advised on 11/8/65, that he had
made overtures to VINCENT JAMES PALMISANO over the past weekend’
regarding the secuiities which PALMISANO allegedly has in his
possession or control. This informant advised that PALMISANO
was vague concerning these securities, and did not encourage
the informant to propose a buy. ‘ 7

The confidential dource referred to in instant report
is CHRISTER GRAY, whose true name 1s CHESTER JOSEPH ZOCHOWSKT, |,
ta Bd cea ed AI-B405Hu 90 ¢
.On 12/13/65, CHESTER GRAY telephonically advised :
Supervisor, ARTHUR F. NEHRBASS of the New York Division that
he (GRAY) had been approached by an individual in Miami who

inquired whether he (GRAY) would have the necessary connection ee
to handle 2) million dollars in street name securities which | .
had been stolen in NYC about 3 or 4 months ago. GRAY stated 3

that he felt that through this individual in Miami, they would i
be able to set up a situation in which arrest could be had, and }
the recovery of these securities could be made. GRAY was advised

by Supervisor NEHRBASS that the FBI could not enter into an

informant relationsnip with GRAY because of his past activities.

GRAY indicated that if the FBI did not work with him in this
particular matter, he would be willing to work with the local
authorities. GRAY was advised by Supervisor NEHRBASS that he
(GRAY) would be recontacted reletive to this matter. n

On 1/6/66, when GRAY met with NORMAN ROTHMAN at a
drug store at Bal Harbour, Florida, between 10:00 AM and .
10:20 AM, GRAY observed and overheard ROTHMAN making @ long
distance telephone call from & phone booth in this drug store...
This phone number was numbered 865-9225. GRAY provided ROTHMAN :
with 6 quarters and one dime to pay for this call to NYC, the ’
total of this call being $1.60.

i Records of the Miami Biephone Company were checked pitas
at 10:30 AM on 1/6/66, and reflected that at 10:14 AM on 1/6/66, * cae
a long austance call was placed frem Miami phone 865-9251, a pay
phone located at 6765 Harding Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida. This
call was in the amount of $1.60 and was paid for by the Miami +
caller by a deposit of 6 quarters and une dime. The number
called in NYC was NYC Telephone Number 792 8077.

iat ae ntti

As the Bureau is aware when dealing with individuals
such as ROTHMAN the prefix is usually given to the operator, and
the last 2 digits of the phone being used are either transposed
or cnanged completely to avoid a trace on the call being made.

Records of the NYC Telephone Company, as checked on
1/6/66, rerlect that NYC Telephone Number 792 8077 is an unlisted
telepnone of JOSEPHINE DELLI PAOLI, 3153 Wateroury Avenue, Bronx,
New York. .

: : Files of the NY Division reflect an ITSMV rerer2nce
concerning JOSEPHINE and ORLANDO DELLI PAOLI of 1155 Cross Avenue,
Brcnx, New York, with a subsequent change of address to 3153

Waterbury Avenue, Bronx, New York. Files of the NY Division ie
reflect a number of references to ORLANDO DELLI PAOLI aka Bobby
London, FBI # 1 082 274, : Si ell 36

bey De 8)

NY¥file °2-2817 contains a reBirknce to ORLANDO DELLI
PAOL whose residence is listed as 3153 Waterbury Avenue, Bronx,
New sork. As reference reflects that ROBERT DELLI PAOLI, aliases
of ORLANDO DELLI PAOLI, resides at the same Waterbury Avenue address.

The above reference contains Gocumentwof ORLANDO DELLI PAOLT
as follows: : ne

ORLANDO DELLI PAOLI has FBI #1 082 274, and 1s also
known as BOBBY LONDON, BOBBY JORDAN, and ROBERT DE PAUL. He

was born in NYC on 9/10/12, and has marrest record which includes :

assault and battery, robberies, and violations of internal revenue
laws, According to the-Federal Bureau of Narcotics Mafie Book :
(protect source}, as checked by SA JAMES FLYNN in 1958, DELLI
PAOLI was an associate of JOE VALACHI. ‘

It would appear that O™LANDO DBLLI PAOLI is the type of
individual who would have the contacts within the criminal element
in the NYC area to have access to the stock certificates in instant
case,

LEADS:
MIAMI_DIVISION
AT MIAMI, FLORIDA. i
(1) Will check record of the Miami Telephone Company

regarding any long distance calls placed by NORMAN ROTHMAN from :
his home phone number at Miami which is UN 6 -4030.

(2) Will maintain contact with logical informants
regarding instant case. Miami Division is requested to exercise
discretion in informant contacts in view of the fact that the
possibility exists that NORMAN ROTHMAN may still be able to
negotiate for the stock certificates. :

* (3) Will furnish background information from the
files of the Miami Division regarding NORMAN ROTHMAN. Miami,
at this time, should make absolutely no effort to contact
NORMAN ROTHMAN as the possibility exists that CHESTER GRAY
can still set up a situation with ROTHMAN whereby the’ securities
in instant case can be recovered.
