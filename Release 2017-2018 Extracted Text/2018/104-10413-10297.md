4) LIFEAT/CUBAN

LIFEAT coverage of two relatives of AMSTRUT~2 provides an "essential" check
on the activities of AMSTRUT-2, and particular information which aids the in-
terested case officers pan the actual contacts with AMSTRUT-2 plus the progres
of the AMSTRUT operation, The value of LIFEAT providing an unilateral check
on the activities of AMSTRUT~2 and her relatives during critical periods of the
AMSTRUT operation cannot be over emphasized, Copies of the daily take from
the two lines covered by LIFEAT for the AMSTRUT operation are forwarded
twice a week to WAVE,

5) LIFEAT/EXILE

LIFEAT information is drawa on heavily both for the present harassment camyai
directed against ESLARD~-1 as well as for daily intelligence on the activities and
contacts of this target. Weekly summaries of LIFEAT provided material are
cabled directly to Headquarters and Station Guatemala City,

6) LIFEAT/AMERICAN COMMUNISTS

return from home leave of the ODENVY processor of these lines, . Travel and

keepers wexe originally recruited or shifted from other projects to employment
in LIFEAT (in most cases at least ten years ago) they are either aware or have

. avid M, WILSTED returned from home leave on 1 February 1963 and assumed full !
© 'résponsibilities as LIFEAT outside Case Officer, Wayne C, DRABAND and

© LUEMBRACE-8 who substituted for WILSTED in the LIFEAT operational and techni-
cal-phases respectively during WILSTED's absence are to be commended for their
nia inta ining LIFEAT at the high level of efficiency and security normally enjoyed

‘by, the operation, DRABAND's performance was the subject of separate correspon-
déace (see HMMT-3469),

Ag presently projected, Wayne C, DRABAND will be leaving Mexico on or about 1

{5 November 1963, The responsible Station Case Officer and WILSTED are attempting

‘\ toiresolve the problem of a replacement for DRABAND at the local level, primarily

‘) from the pool of agents already employed under the project, This would have the
advantage of not further disseminating the fact that LIFEAT does exist, but would

* have the serious drawback of giving knowledge of the whole operation (i.e. all

: basehouses) to anot} ican national, (Note: At present LIFEUD~2 and

i LIFEUD-3, the ww i now conneci the tap lines ro the basehouses, are

ithe only Mexican nationals who know of the location of all LIFEAT basehouses, )

**The Station does not desire another staff employee to fill this position, but would
jyprefer a U.S, citizen, technically competent, with some working knowledge of Span-
4céish or ability to acquire a working knowledge of Spanish. Since working papers are
extremely difficult to obtain at present, for cover purposes anyone coming into

{Mexico to fill the LIFEAT position would probably have to come as.a retired person
‘tSwith a guaranteed income, It is thought that perhaps an individual retiring from one

44;of the Armed Forces in a technical rating might have the best possibilities of filling
Vall the requirements noted,

: Although the Station will continue to explore all possible solutions zo the problem,

(Pit is requested that Headquarters’ views and, if possible, assistance be givea the
“{ Station in this, matter,

b 2, ‘During the reporting period a number of memoranda were prepared by
“the Station for passing to local ODACID and ODENVY based in whole or in part on

LIFEAT provided material, The following HMMs were provided as a by-product
of the LIFEAT Operation:
