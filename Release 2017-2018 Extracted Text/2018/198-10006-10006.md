SECOND WORKING DRAFT
CUBA
MOVEMENT OF PROPAGANDA MATERIALS

I. Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede
the movement of Communist propaganda materials from Cuba
to and within Latin American countries. Actions contemplated
to control the movement of propaganda are closely related to,
and in many cases identical with, those which control the
movement of persons and arms. As noted in the earlier paper
which addressed the problem of movement of subversive trainees
to and from Cuba, the successful execution of all the pro-
posals expressed below will materially reduce the flow of
propaganda materials put will not eliminate it entirely.

Communist Cuba has many legitimate outlets through
which propaganda materials flow. As these legitimate out-
lets are blocked by the initial steps herein proposed, it
will be necessary for the Cuban propagandists and their sympa-
thizers elsewhere to turn from the mass exportation of
materials, and to rely more heavily upon production and
dissemination of the same materials in a clandestine environ-
ment within each Latin American country. Of the two threats,
the illicit production of propaganda materials in each

country will be by far the more difficult to abate.

II. Nature and Scope of the Problem
While the Castro image has faded somewhat in Latin

America, by virtue of his own imprudent actions, the
susceptibility of the Latin American people to communist
propaganda remains high. The basic social and economic
factors which have made this true in the past have not
greatly altered, and the variety and quantity of propaganda
materials with which the Latin Americans are now beset are
impressive, as exemplified in the one hundred million dollars
which the communists are estimated to be investing in the
project annually. It is a large program and it presents a
continuing threat to the tranquility of Latin America.

For the purpose of this paper, propaganda materials
include radio program scripts, tapes and recordings, printed
materials, (posters, pamphlets, magazines, leaflets, books,
newspapers, news service output), motion pictures, duplicating
or reproducing equipment, electronic communications equipment,
and printing resources, particularly paper stockpiles. To
be complete, moreover, "movement of propaganda materials"
must extend to small quantities of selected publications
which are hand-carried into a country by legal or illegal
travellers for subsequent reproduction. It must also include
materials transmitted through Cuban and Soviet Bloc diplomatic
channels, shipments via postal channels, quantities intro-

duced through smuggling operations, oral transmission of

propaganda guidelines by inaivialad travellers or by Radio
Havana, and the dissemination of slanted news by Prensa Latina,
the official Cuban news agency, for pick-up and reproduction
by local outlets, Finally to be considered are thematic
guidance which ¢an be reproduced and exploited locally by
returning trainees, front groups and sympathetic publi-
cations and, in some countries such as Mexico, Argentina
and Uruguay, the products of those commercial establishments
which regularly print or broadcast pro-Castro materials
as a matter of policy or ideological conviction.

Press and Publications

There are 326 Communist and pro-Communist newspapers
and periodicals in Latin America. Beyond this, infiltration
of the democratic press, coupled with the non-critical
attitudes of some newspapermen gives wider diffusion to the
Cuban propaganda line. In addition, there are 228 communist
oriented publishing houses and bookstores in Latin America,
serving as outlets not only for 30 different Cuban period-
icals, but for a large variety of other Communist printed
material. Every Latin American country except the Dominican
Republic, Paraguay, Nicaragua, and Venezuela permits these
bookshops to operate. Many of them offer publications at
very low prices or even give away two or three books with

the purchase of one, and easy credit terms are available.

Excluding TASS and New China News Agency (NONA),
Prensa Latina is the principal Communist news agency in
Latin America. It operates openly, but not entirely without
restriction, in ten countries -- Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Panama and
Uruguay. Although its users are chiefly leftists or overt
Communists, in some countries there is fairly extensive un-
attributed use of Prensa Latina releases, especially in
radio.

All of this is essentially overt. However, decrees
panning Communist activity and propaganda have not prevented
the clandestine publication and distribution of a number of
periodicals, books and other printed materials in some
countries, notably Argentina, and propaganda materials
continue to seek undetected entry through the mails. In
Panama, for example, postal and customs authorities destroy
an average of 12 tons of Cuban propaganda per month. Another
ten tons, from the unknown quantity which enters Costa Rica
each month, is identified in the post office or the airport
and destroyed.

Radio

Short wave radio is the principal direct mags audience
medium used by Cuba to carry subversive propaganda to Latin

America. The Castro regime has constantly increased Radio

Havanats short wave broadcasts to Latin America to a
eurrent level of 115:30 hours per.week,

Cultural Activities

Penetration under the guise of "cultural" activities
is a favored Communist propaganda technique in Latin America.
There are 64 Cuban binational centers and Friendship Societies
in the area.

Films

Feature films and short documentaries produced by the
Cuban Institute of Motion Picture Art and Industry (ICAIC)
play a direct propaganda role, These films are shown primarily
in binational centers, pro-Communist labor and student groups,
and in private or clandestine meetings.

It will be seen from this brief review that Latin
America is the target of a broad scale propaganda program,
comprising not only propaganda materials put including also
the ideas, the knowledge and the resources which are necessary
to make those materials effective.

III, Direct Actions to Impede Legal Movement of Propaganda
Materials.

Presented below is a summary of actions contemplated
to impede the legal movement of propaganda materials from
Cuba to and within Latin American countries. For the purpose
of this paper, legal movement is defined as movement by
recognized private and governmental carriers and communications,
as well as postal systems and diplomatic pouching.

These actions offer promise of achieving early and
effective results in some Latin American countries. They do
not have universal application and that those which are
feasible in one country may not be so in another.

1. Political Actions

a. Induce newspapers in countries in which
Prensa Latina operates to cancel their subscriptions
to the service, on the basis of its subversive
character.

b. Persuade those governments which receive
Cuban and Bloc diplomatic missions to maintain close
surveillance over the propaganda activities of the
Communist embassies with a view toward prohibiting
abuses of diplomatic privilege for subversive purposes.

ec. As applicable and feasible, induce Latin
American countries to:

(1) Adopt adequate internal security legis-
lation which would provide severe penalties for
any person engaging in dissemination of Cuban
Communist propaganda which inspires terrorism
or proposes the overthrow of the legal govern-
ments by force and violence.

(2) Preclude attendance of Cuban delegates
at international meetings held in Latin America.

(Delegates are propaganda disseminators, )

2. Intelligence Actions
a. Continue U.S; inbelidgence efforts in each

country to identify individuais, organizations and
facilities involved in propaganda importation, repro-
duction and/or dissemination; make available to each
country selected intelligence concerning these individ-
vals, organizations and their activities.

b. Encourage each country in which the Communist
Party is illegal to offer rewards for information lead-
ing to interception of Castro Communist propaganda
and conviction of persons supplying or disseminating
materials considered dangerous to the country's tran-
quility.

c. In separate diplomatic approaches to each
country, urge full and effective cooperation with the
appropriate organs of the OAS, and bilaterally among
the several nations, in the interchange of information
concerning movement of propaganda materials.

d. Persuade Latin American countries to report
promptly to the diplomatic mission of the country
concerned, the identity of any national of that
country who arrives from Cuba and who is discovered
to have been carrying Communist propaganda materials.
3. Covert Actions

a. Cause disruption in the reproduction and
distribution of propaganda materials, and in the

procurement and delivery of related supplies and
equipment,

b. Induce Latin American printing craftsmen to
deface, destroy, or misprint Castro Communist propa-
ganda in the process of reproduction.

ce. Disrupt Castro Communist sponsored labor and
youth congresses, industrial and agricultural exhibits
in Latin Americen countries,

d. Maintain or increase economic pressures on
media owners, local advertising agencies and film
producers and/or distributors who accept Communist
materials.

e. Modify texts of Communist propaganda, inserting
anti-Castro/Communist material into the distribution
chain.

f, Dissuade U.S, and local business firms from
advertising in Latin American media which carry
pro-Communist materials; prepare and circulate to
U.S, firms, for information, lists of such media in
order to encourage their support of a non-Communist
press.

g. Inhibit the spread of Cuban and Bloc binational
centers and Friendship Societies in Latin America by
an active program to expose their subversive activities

and objectives.

h. Provide selective financial support to non-Communist
newspapers or press services in order to make them
economically competitive with Communist-aligned publi-
eations.

1. Organize surveillance over in-country sources of
newsprint and related supplies, and deny or inhibit
the use of these supplies for printing Communist materials.

4, Military Aseiztance Action

Obtain and meke available, through U.S, Military
Groups, U.S, materials on the realities of Communist
propaganda, suitable for use in Latin American troop
education programs.

Direct Actions to Impede Illegal Movement of Propaganda

Material.

As the actions outlined in the preceding sections

pecome effective, movement of propaganda materials will be

forced into clandestine channels. Although many of the

actions outlined in Section III will serve to restrict illegal

movement, additional measures to impede this clandestine

traffic will acquire increasing importance.

1. Intelligence Actions
a. Use penetration and other intelligence techniques

to identify efforts to move propaganda materials from
Cuba to and/or within Latin American countries; determine

routes and methods employed; report selected information,

consistent With requirenehts for protecting our own
intelligence program, to governmerits concerned.

b. Utilize the U.S, intelligendé community to
determine the nature and extent of clandestine air-
craft and small boat traffic between Cuba and other
countries in the Caribbean and Central American area,
with special attention to Mexico, Honduras, Jamaica,
Haiti and Dominican Republic. Use the evidence obtained
to induce governments concerned to initiate surveillance
and other control measures aimed at interception of
propaganda materials.

2. Surveillance and Reporting Action

Exploit the mechanism of the Caribbean surveillance
system approved by the President in the study on move-
ment of personnel, for discovering and impeding the
movement of propaganda materials by illicit means.

3. Political Action

Where legally feasible to do so, induce each Latin
American country to improve police procedures to seek
and destroy the subversive Communist propaganda apparatus
in that country, and to detect and eliminate corrupt
officials who permit illicit shipment of propaganda
materials.

4, Techineal Assistance Action
a, Provide technical assistance to enable local

officials to locate clandestine transmitters.

SECRET 16

DocId: 32423821 Page 14


b. Assist Latin American governments, which so
desiné, tod develop a jamming capability against
Communist radio broadcasts.

5. Military Action

Assist in the accelerated improvement of Latin
American internal security forces, especially patrol
and intelligence activities aimed at preventing
clandestine propaganda activities, Provide equipment,

training and advice as required.
