6 MAR 1973

SUBJECT: Travel from Algiers

A sensitive and reliable source reported

on 26 February 1973 that the travel documents

(Titres de Voyage) requested from the Algerian

Government by William HOLDER (Subject of your New

York Field Office File 164-694) are intended for

HOLDER himself, Melvin MCNAIR (Bureau File Number

157-26560), Jean MCNAIR (Bureau File Number 157-

Do Not Reproduce

BROWN (Bureau File Number 157-26564) , Jean

Catherine KERKOW (Subject of your New York Field

Office File 164-694), and Eldridge CLEAVER.

Source speculates that CLEAVER's name was

included with the others desiring travel documents

in order to convince certain Algerian authorities

that CLEAVER, who departed in early Februaty 1973,

was still in Algiers.

Although Source does not

know when the documents will be issued, he believes

that the Government will do so.

Both Melvin MCNAIR and George BROWN werE

arrested by the Algerian police on separate charges

of possession of handguns. BROWN was found to be

carrying

a loaded revolver,

and MCNAIR had given

an Algerian youth two pistols for safekeeping.

One of the pistols was of Chinese manufacture.

Neither BROWN noT MCNAIR were kept under arrest for

any length of time.
