SUBJECT: Travel from Algiers

1. <A sensitive and reliable source reported
on 26 February 1973 that the travel documents
(Titres de Voyage) requested from the Algerian
Government by William HOLDER (Subject of your New
York Field Office File 164-694) are intended for
HOLDER himself, Melvin MCNAIR (Bureau File Number
1157-26560), Jean MCNAIR (Bureau File Number 157-
26561), Larry BURGESS, also known as George Edward
WRIGHT (Bureau File Number 157-26562), Joyce
BURGESS (Bureau File Number 157-26563), George
BROWN (Bureau File Number 157-26564), Jean
Catherine KERKOW (Subject of your New York Field
Office File 164-694), and Eldridge CLEAVER.

2. Source speculates that CLEAVER's name was
included with the others desiring travel documents
in order to convince certain Algerian authorities
that CLEAVER, who departed in early February 1973,
was still in Algiers. Although Source does not
know when the documents will be issued, he believes
that the Government will do so.

3. Both Melvin MCNAIR and George BROWN were
arrested by the Algerian police on separate charges
of possession of handguns. BROWN was found to be
carrying a loaded revolver, and MCNAIR had given
an Algerian youth two pistols for safekeeping.

One of the pistols was of Chinese manufacture.
Neither BROWN nor MCNAIR were kept under arrest for
any length of time.
