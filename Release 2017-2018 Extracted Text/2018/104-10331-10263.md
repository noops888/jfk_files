Statemont of

Steven D. Tilley, Chief’ ot'the Access and Freedom of Information Staff
National Archives and Records Administration

Bofore the
Subcommittee on National Security, Intemational Affairs, and Criminal Justice

Mr. Chairman, I am Steven D, Tilley, Chief of the Access and Freedom of information Act Steff
of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). I wih to thank you for the
opportunity to testify today on behalf of NARA in support of H.R. 1553, which will extend the
authorization of the John F. Kennedy Astacsination Records Review Roard for one year to
September 30, 1998. I am appearing today in my cupwsity as NARA's Chief of the Prosidant John
F, Kennedy Assassination Recorda Collection. In that role I am charged with implementing
NARA's responsibilities under the Act and I serve as NARA’s fiaison to ths Assassination
Records Review Board (ARRB). This aftemoon I would like to tell you a little bit of my
background concerming records of the accacsinatian af President Kennedy. explain the role of
NARA in impleoséating the Act, and outline why the National Archives and Records
‘Administration supports passage of this important piece of legislation.

Mr, Chairman, my career ae an archivist has involved working with some of the most sensitive i
and highly clascified records of our Government. | oversaw the closing of the office of the
Watergate Special Prosecution Force (WSPF) and supervised tho tranafer of thece records to the |

National Archives in 1977. 1 worked with the records of the WSPF for more than 11 years,

serving for most of tlust tine as the senior archivist for those records. I also eerved ac the senior
archivist for the records of the National Security Council (NSC) following the transfer of the NSC
records of the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations in 1983. In 1989 I joined the staff of the
National Security Council, where I served as Director of Freedom of Information AcU/Privacy Act
Activities and later as NSC's Director of Laformatioa Disclosure with responsibility for all
disclosure activilios of the NSC. In 1993, I returned to NARA to become the Chief of the IFK
Collection, and ] have served in that capacity ever since, I hecame the Chief of the Acucss wud

FOIA, Staff in January of this year.

Under the JFK Act, NARA had several major responsibilities. Three of these requirements,
lwwever, proved to be central to the work of the Assassination Records Review Roard. Our first
responsibility was to formally establish the President John F, Kennedy Assussination Records
Collection which ‘we accomplished with the publication of an announcement in the Federal
Register on December 21, 1992. As established on that date, the Collection only consisted of
open records already in NARA‘s custody, primarily the records of the Warren Commission.
Sccondly, within 45 dayc of the etatute being signed, NARA wis voquired to prepare and make
available standard identification forms for use by all goverment offices im describing assassination
records and to create a database of these forms to serve at an electronic finding aid to the JeK
Collection. Our third responsibility, which we shared with other government offices, was to
identify, review, and make available to the public all assassination records that could be disclosed
under the provisions of the law within 2 300 day review period Descriptions of all records
reviewed were required to be entered into the database where they would be mado widely

available to the public.

P.S/10
Af the end of the revicw poriod in August 1993, newly released records were made available for
research, including most of Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 Personality file, part of the Central

Intelligonce Agency's “segregated collection” of assassination related documents, and the records

of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The database was also available for use by

researchers on that day.

When the ARRB members were confirmed by the Senate in April, 1994, ary staff and I bogan to
work with the Board and later with the Board’s staff, to provide information on the records in
the Collection at that time, the development and use of the database, our contacts and discussions
with other agencies involved in searches for assassination related documents, and the existence of
assessination records in the custady of private repasitaries or individuals, The ARRB and NARA
have maintained an exceflent working reistionubip duough the 3 yaars of thc Board's oxitence,
and I would like to think that this close relationship hus in some way contributed to the success of
the ARRB,

NARA enthusiastically supports passage of H.R. 1553 to extend the ARRB's authorization. Our
mission ig not unlike that of the ARRB . 10 casurc roady access to cssontial dooumentary
evidence. In the Boerd’s case the essential evidence is any records relating to the assassination of
Presidept Kennedy. In our case escential evidence consists of all federal and presidential records
that documoat the rights of American citizens, the actions of federal officials, and the national
oxperieace. The Review Bostd needs the time designated in this bill to complete its important

work in making available as complete us hictorical recoed as possible concerning the

assassination of President Kennady. Woe would like to offer for your consideration some statistics

and facts to demonstrate the success of the Hoard and support its onc-year exteasion.

The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection today bears little resemblance to the
Collection that was established in December 1992, As that time, the Collection consisted of
approximately 450 oubia foct of records from a few agencies. Today, the Collectian has grown to
more than 1,600 cubic feet of records or 3.75 million pages from more than 30 diffaeat
government offices. Those numbers are a testament to the work of the Review Board in

obtaining the cooperation of the entire Federal government in this important task,

The ARRB bas not only succeeded in obtaining the cooperation of the Federal agencies but has
also negotiated the donation of very important recards that were previously held in private hands.
Donations have included the related papers of James Garrison and Edward Wegmann, the
prosecutor and defense attomey in the conspiracy trial of Clay Shaw, and the papers of J. Lee
Rankin, the General Counsel and Chief of Staff of the Warren Commission. Copies of the papers
of Senator Richard Russell, a member of the Warran Commission, that were donated to the
University of Georgia are being reviewed aud wa bope will be made part of the Collection in the
near future with the agreement of the University. For the information of the Committes, Mr.
Chairman, I have attached to my testimony a copy of the Register of the Collection, which lists

the major groups of Federal recorde and private papers, along with the supplemental listing of FBI '

files.

Not only hus the Collection increased dramatically in sizc, the significance of the recorde in the
Collection cannot be overestimated. In addition to the recards of numerous Hxecutive branch
agencies and offices, tho records of relevant Congressional committees, related court cases, and
records donated by private entities arc available in the Collection. This rich documentation is
searchable electronically, giving researchers the ability to seck out documents conceming a topic, '
Person, os cycut, of even individual documents, not only ot NARA‘ College Park facility, but
from their own personal computer through the Lmemot. Hqually important, the Collection
provides researchers with a view of how our goverament worked during this period in history, as
the documents reficct not only the operations of government as the offices and agencies reacted to
the death of the President but also how thase offices and agencies were operating in regard to
other cvents that are related to tho assassination, such as the campaign to destabilize the
govemment of Cuba or the FBI's mvestigation of various organized crime figures. Pethups Uds
unique window on the operations of these agencies may be the most important rosult of the

development of the Collection.

Purthermore, tho Collection continues to grow. Additional FBI records will he added in the
weeks and months ahead. Records of the Departments of the Army and Navy and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff are currently under reviow. The addition of these records will only add to the

richness of the Collection and increase its value to the geaoral research community.

Public demand for those records is the ultimate evidence of the the value of the Collection.

Reforence requests have risen in number every year since the Culleutivu gpeacd with new records

in August 1993. This year we have already received close to 600 written inquiries, an increase of

website, the assassination records have been accessed over 100,000 times by the publio, Many of
the written inquiries we reccive include copies of record identification forms taken from the
database, showing that the researcher has accessed our website and downloaded information. The
availability of the databace via the Internet remain one of the most important developments that

have come from this process.

Dus to the exceptional work of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board, great
progress has been made on making available as complete a record es possible on the history of the
aseacemation of John Kennedy. Without the focus, integrity, and exportice of the ARRB, the
Collection wuuld uot have the size, quality, or public demand witacesed today. However, there is

still much to do. NARA supports passage of H.R. 1553 so that this important work can be

completed.
