COMMENTS OF REVIEDING OFFICIAL

At first glance I find the ratings in Section B high and wonder

how he would compare with other

technicians doing the same work even

though he is performing in a very professional manner.

From the

technical standpoint he has kept the operation alive

through

perseverance, hard work and a high degree of technical proficiency.

His ability to get along with his Mexican contacts and the degree of

respect they have for him is very commendable. Not having the

opportunity to compare hin with other technicians, doing the same job

under identical circumstances, it is difficult to find & fair rating.

COMMENTS OF REVIERIAC OFFICIAL

While

-performance in his rathor unique capucity has

indeed been

exceptional, it should be clearly noted that these

ratings reflect, more than anything elso, a measure of his performance

In that unique

(but highly circumscribed) capacity, a performance

which would be hard to match.

They should not be interpreted however

as a relative grading ofes

as compared with other more "broad

guage" personnel at the sane grade lovel.

It is for that reason that

the Station did not recommend

→ for promotion, but rather for

a quality step increase which was approved.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Gloo recommendations loo his pears.

future personnal oxltona.

This officer is an extremoly willing and hard worker. From the technical

slandpoint his performance is satisfactory in every sense.

He devotes long hours

to kceping the equipment in perfect working order and Is always willing and ready

to accept any extra assignment given him regardless of his personal and family

commitments. Hla principal weakness is his almost total Inability to write clear,

conclae reports. Because he lacks aggressiveness and duc to his limited knowledge

of the Spanish language he has been unable to provide first rate case officer control

over the LP under his command.

This is at Icast partlally due to the fact that the

indigenous personnel resent to some extent being under the control of a PBPRIMER

and prefer to take Instructions from the indigenous case officer (LIENVOY/2).

This le not because of the KUBARK Case Officer's personality but because of pride

of natlonally. As a matter of fact, this officer has a very pleasant personality

and gets alung well with his co-workers. With respect to this officer's potential

and future development the rating officer recommends that at the conclusion of

his present sour In June of 1962 that he be reassigned to Headquarters for extensive

Thls training perlod should include basic english, reports writing and

trade craft. L he la to continue as a technical case officer he should also have

further technical training depending upon his future assignments.
