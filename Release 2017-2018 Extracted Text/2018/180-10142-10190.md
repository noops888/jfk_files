that the assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald, she ascertained tye

that it was the same man that approximately two months

documentation he presented she knew that he was married to

a Russian woman and belonged to the "Fair Play for Cuba H

and became certain that it was the same individual who was
blonde, short, dressed unelegantly and whose face turned red

obtain an intransit visa from the Cuban government, it
was imperative that he previously obtain a visa from the
Soviet Consulate. Since obtaining a visa from the Soviets
took four months and Oswald's Mexican visa expired soon
Oswald became excited and Duran had to call the Consul
who had an argument with him. ‘he only aid she could give
Oswald was advising that he see the Soviet Consul, and
calling the person in charge of that office. ‘The Soviet
official told her that they ‘would have to consult Moscow
which would take four months. That afternoon, Oswald re-
’ turned to the Cuban Consulate and Sylvia Duran confirmed

that he could get a Cuban visa only after he received a

44,

Russian visa. She gave Oswald her name and business phone

number but never gave him her address because she had no

reason to give it to him. She knew that phoning the soviet
Consulate was not one of her duties and that if she dia
so she did it only to help Oswald. She gave Oswald her
business phone number only because he would have to ‘call

subsequently to check whether he had obtained a visa. He

On October 5, 1964, eleven days after the ptiblica-
tion of the Warren Commission Report, a story eisging
Lee Harvey Oswald's presence at a party in Mexico City
attended by Cuban government personnel came to the atten-

tion of the Central Intelligence Agency (wx742? p.94, .entry

1430, CIA #721; Blind memo dated 10/5/64, CIA #576). in

Elena's Story as Reported October 5, 1964

: af
goer ep ghy pun

Elena Garro de Paz and Deba Garro de Guerrero Galvan,
first cousins £ Horatio, Ruben and Lynn Duran were invited
to a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran in the middle
of the week in the fall of 1963. Lee Harvey Oswald was
alleged to have been at this party in the company of “two
other beatnik-looking boys." (Ibid.) The Americans re-
mained together the entire evening and did not dance.

When Elena tried to speak with the Americans, she was

"shifted" to antoher room by one of her cousins” (the

memo does not state whether Elena had mentioned which cousin
had not allowea her to speak to the Americans.) One of
Elena's cousins told her at the time that (he or she) did
net know who the Americans were except that Sylvia Duran

(an employee of the Cuban Embassy and the wife of Horatio

Duran), had brought them to the party.



The day after the party, Elena and Deba saw the
three Americans on the Insurgents, a main avenue ‘in Mexico
city." the Garros claimed that they had recognized Oswald's
photograph when it was published after the assassination Z:5 4)
Sylvia Duran's arrest "underlined the Garros' certainty"
that the ma had been Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid.)

Deba added that Lynn and one of the Duran brothers
had made. trips to-Texas. (Ibid.) She added that, even
though the Duran brothers had always been poor before
the assassination, they were both driving expensive new
cars. (Ibid.)

the Gource of the memofwas a witting Central Intelli-
gence Agency asset known by the cryptonym LICOOKIE: I whon) .
the Committee identified as June Cobb Sharp while receiv-
ing (1cooKtE" 5 file. According to Elena, Ms. Cobb was
sent to her house shortly after the assassination for a
few days, by a mutual friend, a Costa Rican writer Eunice
Odio. (CIA No's 580-583; WX-7241, Entry #427, p. 92, CIA
#719) Ms. Garro asserted that while at her house, Ms.
Cobb expressed interest in the Kennedy assassination.!” One
night Elena's sister Deba, who was visiting, got drunk and
told the_whole story. (Ibid.) Claiming to be a CIA agent,
Cobb suggested that Elena and Deba go to Texas to tell
their story. (Ibid.) Elena stated that when Cobb's sugges-

tion was rejected, Cobb stated that she would arrange a meet



ing with the CIA Station Chief. (Winston Scott was the
Mexico City Station Chief in 1964). The meeting did not
occur because Ms. Cobb was asked to leave the Garro
house evidently because she kicked Elena's cat. (CIA
No's 580-583; Wx7241, Entry #427, p. 42, CIA #719). A
notation on the memo says thatG@y1 (Licookie I) never re-
gained contact) with Elena Garro de Paz. (Wx7241, p. 94,

Entry #430, CIA #721; Blind Memo dated 10/5/64, CIA #576).

the (Licookie) memo was not inserted in either the
Elena Garro or Lee Hafvey Oswald "p" (personality) files
but in a local leftist and Cuban project file. The Com-
mittee learned about the memo from Wx~-7241, a chronologi- Rie
cal history of the Oswald case prepared by Anne Goodpasture
for the CIA in 1976). The memo was found in December,
1965. (See Wx 7241, p. 94, CIA #721). Gtantey Watson)
found the memo. A marginal notation on Wx7241 says, “Why
was this not sent to Headquarters?" (P. 87, CIA #714). The

Committee has been able to determine that the memo was for-

warded to headquarters shortly thereafter.

Biography... Q3 CZ ;

aa The story was told by Elena Garro de Paz who was

born of Spanish parents in Puebla, Mexico on December 11,

1917. (All information in this section culled from Bio-

graphy Dta form prepared by Charles Thomas.) Ms. Garro

attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico and

fave Sere ee eeee eee feat pater ye et



later did graduate work at Berkley in California and at
the University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been mar-
ried to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of
Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals. When
Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple
separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also named
Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life
in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity about
her native land and had a reputation for being one of its
more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena was
considered emotionally committed to ayfoy aspects of Mexican
life and made an important contribution to its artistic
development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Sefora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende,_Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciatve audiences in Europe,
where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexi-
co. Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume

called La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of

the London Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de
Porvenir, "a spendid success." Critics have said of her:
"For Elena Garro, there is no¥ frontier between reality
and fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality--

perhaps more intense--to which one may penetrate without



passport or forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of
a literature fired with passion, flavor and life." Many
people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier
between reality and fantasy is also difficult for her to
distinguish in real life. (Biography Data Form on Elena
Garra de Paz prepared by Charles Thomas.)

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

the Confederacion Nacional Campesina (CNC), the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro
was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the
poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms
with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all
over the country. (Ibid.)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated
woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright
opinions and sharp wit. tended on occasion to ruffle feathers
in Mexico, hut her important social, literacy, and political
connections rendered her faily immune from serious counter-
attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the
country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba
Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations has been unable
to determine the exact reason Ms. Garro had for fleeing

Mexico.



gee

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was
well disposed toward the United States and had been friendly
with Embassy officers. Her hroad range of significant
personal friends, the views of many important to the
American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target. (A
"useful Embassy target” is a person deemed important enough
because of acquintances to merit frequent contact, either

witting or unwitting, with American Embassy officials.)

4. October 12, 1964 CIA Memo for the Record

On October 12, 1964 the Chief of Covert Action (Jim
.Plannery, Jwrote a memo for the record reporting that Elena
Garro de Paz had told her story to Eunice Odio. (The Com-
mittee has not been able to determine if Elena Garro told
Ms.. Odio the story personally ox if Ms. Cobb related to
Ms. Odio what Elena had told her) who relayed it to ("Tich-
born" /Tichhorn was Henry P. Lopez! cryptonym. Mr. Lopez
was a witting asset who’ wrote ‘propaganda: pieces? forthe cra.)
After careful review of his CIA file, the HSCA has not
been able to establish a link from(Hr. Lopez) to either Ms.
Odio or Ms. Garro_7 on 10/9/64. 10/12/64 memo, CIA
#596; Wx7241, p. 87, CIA #7147

The story is not as detailed as the 10/5/64 version.
There is no mention of Deba Garro Guerrero Galvan. The

story, perhaps because it is third hand, differs from the

previous story in two areas: The party was at the Cuban

\\ Embassy, not at. Ruben Duran's; Elena talked to a Cuban


snsssssssttihy

Embassy official, not oné of her Cousins about the three
Americans.

Attached to the memo was a note fro

the Chief of Station, Winston Scott, which cae "Do you
want me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?" Scott
then noted that the memo should be filed. The file indi-
cations: show that the memo went into the Oswald "P" file

and the Elena Garro."P" file. (Ibid.)

that the Communists probably had facilities for falsifying
postcards. (Ibid.)

To investigate Ms. Garro's story further, the
Federal Bureau interviewed Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius
on November 27,°1964. (Ibid. p.4) lLavagnini recalled that
there were approximately thirty people at the Ruban Duran

party, few of whom he knew. He recalled having met a Mexi-


an Wes

can girl who had recently returned from living in France.
He was unable to fix the date of the party, but felt it

Charles Thomas' First Meeting with Elena Garro Where Lee

\e

Harvey Oswald is Discussed

On 12/10/65 Charles Thomas, a political officer at
the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a conversa-
tion with Elena Garro de Paz. (CIA #586-587, WX-7241 Entry
No. 425, p. 91, CIA No. 718.)| The meeting with Elena had
been about other matters but she mentioned knowing Oswald.
Thomas noted that she was reluctant to talk but did. (Ibid.)

quarters (Cable from Mexico City to the Director, Mexi 5621,

Regarding Elena Garro's Allegations

On 2/23/66 the Legal Attache wrote a memo to the
Ambassador reporting that “extensive investigation"
failed to disclose that Oswald had traveled to Mexico
prior to September 26, 1963 aha that no information had
developed that would show that he had not been in New Or-
leans in the early part of that month. /Memo from Legat
to Ambassador, 2/23/66, CIA #571; WX-7241 Entry #455, p.‘95,
CIA #7227. The memo reitereated that no further action
was being taken by the FBI because Elena's allegations had
not been substantiated. ({Ibid.) The Legal Attache fowarded
a pee Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico City
Station. (The House Select Committee on Assassinations has
been unable to determine when the copy was forwarded to
the CIA.) A marginal comment made by Anne Goodpasture next
to this entry in WxX-7241 says, “How can it be ascertained
that Oswald did not travel to Mexico prior to early September
1963? There must be some basis for Elena's reporting."

Legal Attache Memo to Winston Scott re Elena's Allegation

that She Had Stayed at the Hotel Vermont from the Day After

the Assassination until November 30, 1963

On 10/13/66 the Legal Attache wrote a memo to the
CIA/COS reporting that a reliable confidential informant
had reported that the records of the Hotel Vermont dis-
closed that "Elena Paz, housewife from San Luis Potosi"
had registered at the Hotel Vermont on November 23, 1963.
She left on November 30, 1963. (Memo from Legat to Winston
Scott, 10/13/66, CIA No. 564; WX-7241, Entry #466, p. 98,
CIA #725; Thomas' 7/13/66 memo.) (The House Select Committee
on Assassinations has been unable to determine why the
Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigations waited until 1966 to investigate this aspect
of Elena's story.) The Memo said that "the above individual

y or may not be identifical with Elena Garro de Paz." (Ibid.



Charles Thomas! 12/25/65 memo, states, "She (Elena)
and her daughter did not personally register at the hotel.
She thinks Calvillo registered them as relatives or friends
of his from San Luis Postosi." (Memo of Conversation by
Charles Thomas, 12/25/65, p. 3, CIA #582) The entry for
the 10/13/66 Legat memo in WX-7241 bore the notation,

“This is what Elena claimed and no one would believe her."

Charles Thomas' September 30, 1969 Letter to State Depart-

ment and Legal Attaches Response

:No further reportg on Elena's story was generated
until 1969 when Charles Thomas was "selected out." ("Se-
lected out" is a phrase used when an officer is retired
after having been in one grade for the maximum period of
time and is not considered qualified for promotion to a

: At het eey
higher grade). Then, he wrote a memorandum to the Secre-
tary of State which included a cover letter stating,
“Since I was the Embassy Officer in Mexico who acquired
this intelligence information, I feel a responsibility
for seeing it through to its final evaluation.". (State
Department: Letter from Charles Thomas to William Rogers,
Secretary of State, July 25, 1969)

Charles Thomas' memorandum stated that “he got no

reaction from Nathan Ferris and Winston Scott" regarding


pattie Wy Beas

his memorandum of December 25, 1965. (State Department:
Letter from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary

of State, July 25, 1969) In addition, Thomas wrote that
the only person to speak to him about the December 25,

1965 memorandum, Clarence Bomstra (Deputy Chief of Mis-
sion, State Department, Chief of Affirs at the time of
President Kennedy's assassination and subsequent Oswald
investigation) told him that. Oswald had not been in Mexico
on the date given for .the Bere eect Department: Letter
from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary of State,
July 25, 1964) Thomas noted that even when he reiterated
that Elena had not changed her story but rather that she
had now given a more accurate account, Boonstra stated that
the date was wrong and dismissed the entire affair. (Ibid.)
oF one Mexico City Legaths Office? Nathan Ferris, .in
reply to Thomas' letter and memorandum, asserted that
Thomas' office had been advised by memoranda dated Decem-
ber 27, 1965 and February 23, 1966 that since Elena Garro's
allegations had previously been investigated without sub-
stantiation, no further action was being taken concerning
her recent repetition of those allegations. (FBI Report,
9/30/69, pp. 3-4, JFK Doc. No. ) In their report, the
Legat's Office concluded that either the Counselor for Poli-
tical Affairs did not soute the memoranda to Charles Thomas

or that Thomas did not recall receiving them. (Ibid.)

Thomas wrote that when he went to Nathan Ferris'
office to inform him that Elena had found her calendar
and had reconstructed the date of the party as late Sep-—
tember, Ferris replied that Elena had given the late Sep-
tember date when she had originally reported her story at
the American Embassy. (State Department: Letter from Charles
Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary of State, Julye 25,
1969). Thomas noted that Ferris explained that someone
wh chad been at the party had stated that there had not
been any Americans. (Ibid.) He wrote that he had assumed
that Elena could have clearly been mistaken about the identi-
ty of the American she saw there, but never doubted that
she had seen some Americans. (Ibid.) Thomas ailegea that

Elena Garro's Allegations

The House Select Committee on Assassinations inve
gated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews and
personal interviews. The Committee requested and reviewed
the CIA's, FBI's and State Department's files, when
available, on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz,
Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp,

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia

Duran, Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio
Azcue, and Emilio Carballido. Only the Elena Garro de

Paz file contained information on her allegations. Though
all the names listed above played a role in Elena Garro

de Paz' story, not one of their files included a reference
to Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence
Agency's (-rcooxrs Z, LICHANT I, LIRING 3, LIHUFF I and
TICHBORN) files. Once again, not one of the files included
a mention of Elena Garro's allegations. The House Select
Committee on Assassinations learned that ICOOKIE I was)
June Cobb Sharp (who) first reported ‘Elena‘s allegation.

(Supra, p. 4) The Committee also learned chai(LicHanr )



eek (ss

(was) Manuer calvillo(who)had Elena Garro and her daughter ,~
in a hotel the day following the assassination. (Supra,
p. 13) He also told Elena that Sylvia Duran had been ar-
rested before this fact had become public knowledge. (Ibid.)
Since Fiire review was inconclusive, the Committee
decided to arrange interviews in Mexico with Sylvia Duran,
Elena Garro, Elenita Garro, Horacio Duran, Ruben Duran,
Lynn Duran, Emilio Carbillido and Betty Serratos. The
Mexican Government informed the House Select Committee on
Assassinations that Elena and Elenita Garro disappeared
in 1968 during the student uprisings and have never re-
turned to Mexico. The officials stated that Elena and
her daughter might be in Spain. (See Mexico City Proce-
dural Write-up Trip Le.) The Mexican government reported
that Emilio Garballido could not be found. (Ibid.) The
others were interviewed between June 1 and June 6, 1978.
(Ibid.)
Betty Serratos, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran, and Horatio
Duran all stated that Elena was not the dancing type and
therefore did not attend any of the twist parties at the
Duran homes. (See: HSCA Interview of Betty Serratos,
6/6/78, p. 6, JFK Document No. 7; HSCA Staff Interview of
Lydia Duran, 6/5/78, p. 6, JFK Document No. ; HSCA
Staff Interview of Ruben Duran Navarro, 6/6/78, p. 16, JFK
Document No. ; HSCA Staff Interview of Horatio Duran

Navarro, 6/5/78, p. 25, JFK Document No. ). When



eee ples

Sylvia Duran was asked if Elena or Elenita Garro ever
attended twist parties at the Duran homes, she recalled
Elena attending one twist party at Ruben's home in 1963
when the Garros returned to Mexico from France. (HSCA
Staff Interview of Sylvia Tirado Bazan, 6/6/70, p. 90,
JFK, Document No. ) All the Durans denied that Lee
Harvey Oswald had attended any party at one of their
homes. (String cites.)

The Committee next asked the Central Intelligence

Agency to arrange staff interviews wien (Len
Calvillo), LICOOKIE/1 (June cobb); along with a list of
other assets who may have had information related to Lee
Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City. (
The Central Intelligence Agency declined to aid the Com-
mittee in this aspect of the.investigation.

The Committee returned to Mexico City and attempted
to locate June Cobb Sharp and Manuel:!Calvillo. (See’Proce-

dural Write-up Trip 2 Mexico The results of the Com-

mittee's work were as follows )=ffe Mexican government
told the Committee that June Cobb Sharp received a tourist
permit, number 72781, on June 27, 1947 when she entered
Mexico through Nuevo Laredo. She asked, but was deneid,

permission to represent the magazine, Modern Mexico. On

June 21, 1948, she received a courtesy permit, number 25556.

Furthermore, the Mexican government explained that she dis-
