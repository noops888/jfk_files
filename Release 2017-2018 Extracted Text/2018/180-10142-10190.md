Upon learning

about the assassination

she and her

assassinated for racial reasons. When she became aware

that the assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald, she ascertained me

that it was the same man that approximately two months

prior had been

to the Cuban Consulate to solicit an intran-

sit visa

to Russia. Having taken his name from

the special

documentation he presented she knew that he was married to

a Russian woman

Oswald was advising that he see the Soviet

Consul, and

calling the person in charge of that office.

The Soviet

official told her that they would have to consult Moscow

which would take four months. That afternoon, Oswald re

turned to the Cuban Consulate and Sylvia Duran confirmed

that he could get a Cuban visa only after he received a

Russian visa.

She gave Oswald her name and business phone

number but never gave him her address because she had no

reason

to give it to him. She knew that phoning the Soviet

Consulate was not one of her duties and that if she did

so she did it only to help Oswald. She gave Oswald her

business phone number only because he would have to call

subsequently to check whether he had obtained a visa..

never called back.

Elena Garro de Paz and Deba Garro de Guerrero Galvan,

first cousins fo Horatio, Ruben and Lynn Duran were invited

to a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran in the middle

of the week in the fall of 1963. Lee Harvey Oswald was

alleged to have been at this party in the company of "two

other beatnik-looking boys." (Ibid.) The Americans re-

mained together the entire evening and did not dance.

When Elena tried to speak with the Americans, she was

"shifted" to antoher room by one of her cousins! "

(The

memo does not state whether Elena had mentioned which cousin

had not allowed her to speak to the Americans.) One of

Elena's cousins told her at the time that (he or she did

not know who the Americans were except that Sylvia Duran

lan employee of the Cuban Embassy and the wife of Horatio

Duran), had brought them to the party.

The day after the party, Elena and Deba saw the

three Americans on the Insurgents, a main avenue in Mexico

City. 52)

The Garros claimed that they had recognized Oswald's

photograph when it was published after the assassinations:)

Sylvia

Duran's

arrest "underlined the Garros' certainty"

that the mn had been Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid.)

Deba added that Lynn and one of the Duran brothers

had made trips to Texas. (Ibid.) She added that, even

though the Duran brothers had always been poor before

the assassination, they were both driving expensive new

cars. (Ibid.)

The source of the memo'was a witting Central Intelli-

gence Agency asset known by the cryptonym LICOOKIE: I whom

the Committee identified as June Cobb Sharp while receiv

ing (LICOOKIE's) file. According to Elena, Ms. Cobb was

sent to her house shortly after the assassination for a

few days, by a mutual friend, a Costa Rican writer Eunice

odio. (CIA No's 580-583; WX-7241, Entry #427, P. 92, CIA

#719) Ms. Garro asserted that while at her house, Ms.

Cobb expressed interest in the Kennedy assassination.

One

night Elena's sister Deba, who was visiting, got drunk and

told the whole story. (Ibid.) Claiming to be a CIA agent,

Cobb suggested that Elena and Deba go to Texas to tell

their story. (Ibid.) Elena stated that when Cobb's sugges-

tion was rejected, Cobb stated that she would arrange a meet-

ing with the CIA Station Chief. (Winston Scott was the

Mexico City Station Chief in 1964). The meeting did not

occur because Ms. Cobb was asked to leave the Garro

house evidently because she kicked Elena's cat. (CIA

The (LiCookie memo was not inserted in either the

Elena Garro or Lee Harvey Oswald "p" (personality) files

but in a local leftist and Cuban project file. The Com-

mittee learned about the memo from Wx-7241, a chronologi-

cal history of the Oswald

case prepared by Anne Goodpasture

for the CIA in 1976). The memo was found in December,

1965. (See Wx 7241, p. 94, CIA #721). Stanley Watson

found the memo. A marginal notation on Wx7241 says, "Why

was this not sent to Headquarters?" (P. 87, CIA #714) :

The

Committee has been able to determine that the memo was for-

warded to headquarters shortly thereafter.

later did graduate work at Berkley in California and at

the University of Paris. In 1963, Elena had long been mar-

ried to Octavio Paz, a career diplomat who is also one of

Mexico's finest poets and leading intellectuals. When

Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador to India, the couple

separated by mutual consent. Elena's daughter, also named

Elena, has always resided with her mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life

in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity about

her native land and had a reputation for being one of its

more articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena was

considered emotionally committed to aghy aspects of Mexican

life and made an important contribution to its artistic

development.

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Señora en su Balcon,

Ventura

Allende,_ Andaise por las Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciatve audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexi-

co. Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume

called La Semana de Colores.

The Literacy Supplement of

the London Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de

Porvenir, "a spendid success." Critics have said of her:

"For Elena Garro, there is not frontier between reality

and fantasy; in any case, the latter is a second reality-

perhaps more intense--to which one may penetrate without

people who knew Elena have asserted that the frontier

Many

between

reality and fantasy is also difficult for her to

distinguish in real life. (Biography Data Form on Elena

Garra de Paz prepared by Charles Thomas.)

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

the Confederacion Nacional Campesina (CNC) , the agrarian

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro

was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of the

poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal terms

with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders from all

over the country. (Ibid.)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political

connections rendered her faily immune from serious counter-

attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations has been unable

to determine the exact reason

Ms. Garro had for fleeing

Mexico.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was

well disposed toward the United States and had been

friendly

with Embassy officers.

Her broad range of significant

personal friends, the views of many important to the

American Embassy, made her a useful Embassy target.

"useful Embassy target" is a person deemed important enough

because of acquiantances to merit frequent contact, either

witting or unwitting, with American Embassy officials.)

Flannery,

Garro de Paz had told her story to Eunice Odio. (The Com-

mittee has not been able to determine if Elena Garro told

Ms.. Odio the story personally or if Ms. Cobb related to

Ms. Odio what Elena had told her) who relayed it to ("Tich-

Elena also told Thomas that she had later learned that

Silvia Duran had been "Oswald's mistress while he was

there." (A note by this entry in WX-7241 says, "How

his memorandum of December 25, 1965. (State Department:

Letter from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary

of State, July 25, 1969) In addition, Thomas wrote that

the only person to speak to him about the December 25,

1965 memorandum, Clarence Bonstra (Deputy Chief of Mis-

sion, State Department, Chief of Affirs at the time of

President Kennedy's assassination and subsequent Oswald

investigation) told him that Oswald had not been in Mexico

• on the date given for the party.

(State Department: Letter

from Charles Thomas to William Rogers, Secretary of State,

July 25, 1964) Thomas noted that even when he reiterated

that Elena had not changed her story but rather that she

had now given a more accurate account, Boonstra stated that

the date was wrong and dismissed the entire affair. (Ibia.)

The Mexico City Legatis Office, Nathan Ferris, in

reply to Thomas' letter and memorandum, asserted that

Thomas' office had been advised by memoranda dated Decem-

ber 27, 1965 and February 23, 1966 that since Elena Garro's

allegations had previously been investigated without sub-

stantiation, no

further action was being taken concerning

her recent repetition of those allegations. (FBI Report,

9/30/69, pp. 3-4, JFK Doc. No. ) In their report, the

Legat's Office concluded that either the counselor for Poli-

tical Affairs did not

route the memoranda to Charles Thomas

or thât Thomas did not recall receiving them. (Ibid.)

Thomas wrote that when he went to Nathan Ferris'

tember date when she had originally reported her story at

House Select Committee on Assassinations' Investigation of

Elena Garro's Allegations

The House Select Committee on Assassinations investi-

gated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews and

personal interviews.

The Committee requested

and reviewed

the CIA's, FBI's and State. Department's files, when

available, on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz,

Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp.

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia

Duran, Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio

Azcue, and Emilio Carballido. Only the Elena Garro de

Paz file contained information on her allegations. Though

all the names listed above played a role in Elena Garro

de Paz'

story, not one of their files included a reference

to

Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence

Agency's LICOOKIE I, LICHANT I, LIRING 3, LIHUFF I and

IICHBORN files. Once again, not one of the files included

a mention of Elena Garro's allegations. The House Select

(was) Manuel Calvillo(wo had Elena carro and her daughter

in a hotel the day following the assassination. (Supra,

p. 13) He also told Elena that Sylvia Duran had been ar-

rested before this fact had become public knowledge. (Ibid.)

Since

file review was inconclusive, the Committee

decided

to arrange interviews in Mexico with Sylvia Duran,

Elena Garro, Elenita Garro, Horacio Duran, Ruben Duran,

Lynn Duran, Emilio Carbillido and Betty Serratos. The

Mexican Government informed the House Select Committee on

Assassinations that Elena and Elenita Garro disappeared

in 1968 during the student uprisings and have never re-

turned to Mexico. The officials stated that Elena and

her daughter might be in Spain. (See Mexico City Proce-

dural Write-up Trip 1.) The Mexican government reported

that Emilio Garballido could not be found. (Ibid.) The

others were interviewed between June 1 and June 6, 1978.

(Ibid.)

Betty Serratos, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran, and Horatio

Duran all stated that Elena was not the dancing type and

therefore did not attend any of the twist parties at the

Duran homes. (See: HSCA Interview of Betty Serratos,

6/6/78, p. 6, JFK Document No.

Sylvia Duran was asked if Elena or Elenita Garro ever

attended twist parties at the Duran homes, she recalled

Elena attending one twist party at Ruben's home in 1963

when the Garros returned to Mexico from France. (HSCA

Staff Interview. of Sylvia Tirado Bazan, 6/6/70, p. 90,

JEK, Document No. ) All the Durans denied that Lee

Harvey Oswald had attended any party at one of their

homes. (String cites.)

The Committee next asked the Central Intelligence

Agency to arrange staff interviews with LICHANT/1 (Manuel l

Calvillo), LICOOKIE/1 (June Cobbl) along with a list of

other assets who may have had information related to Lee

Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City. (

The Central

Intelligence Agency declined to aid the Com-

mittee in this aspect of the investigation.

The Committee returned to Mexico City and attempted

to locate June Cobb Sharp and Manuel Calvillo. (See Proce-

dural write-up Trip 2 Mexico City) The results of the Com-

Indent.

mittee's work were as follows 1) -The Mexican government

told the Committee that June Cobb Sharp received a tourist

permit, number 72781, on June 27, 1947 when she entered

Mexico through Nuevo Laredo.

She asked, but was deneid,

permission to represent the magazine, Modern Mexico. On

June 21, 1943, she received a courtesy permit, number 25556.

Furthermore, the Mexican government explained that she dis-

appeared in 1954 and never returned to Mexicle see pro-

cedural Writeup Trip 2 Mexico City.)

The Committee believes

that there is a possibility that this information is incor-

rect.

(According to Ms. Cobb's CIA file she worked for the

agency as an asset in Mexico from 1961 through 1966. (CIA

Report, 1965, June Cobb file, 201-

Elena also

stated that Ms. Cobb resided at her home in 1964. (Supra

ever resided there. When Committee

staffers gave the Mexi-

can government Calvillo's pen name, the Mexicans gave the

same answers.

(See Procedural Write Mexico City Trip 2.)

The Committee

is-quite

certain that Mr. Calvillo lived at

at least until 6,76

this address since it acquired the address from a recent

CIA document. (CIA Report, 1976, Manuel Calvillo file,

The Committee believes that there is a possibility

that the Mexican government received orders from the Cen-

tral Intelligence Agency to refrain from aiding the Committee

with this aspect of its work. (See Procedural Write-up
