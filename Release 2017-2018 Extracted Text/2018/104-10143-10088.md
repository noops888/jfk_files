L mrropuarn gi

The 201 system proNia) Ww for identifying a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations ys and for controlling and filing all pertinent
information about that person. The system’ also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories.-Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and
CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2, THE 201 SYSTEM
The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, ie., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as identifyin

g ar for reporting on that

individual
EW
b. The 201 Dossier: the official Fld. eoaGining the 201 opening form (Form
831) and all biographi oink the individual, ie., per-
sonal history, curren

c. The Master 201 Recogy es
a 201 file. This record prod 2a
stores the pertinent informatid Sich ‘may later be retrieved! for specil listings.

a. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an
Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent
within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref.
erence consolidated.
