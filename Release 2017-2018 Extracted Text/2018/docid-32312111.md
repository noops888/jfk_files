CEORGE LANE stated that it was his distinct
impression from-his contact with MARK LANE that MARK LANE
is an agitator who is interested in stirring up racial
disturbances, particularly in the Arcadia and Immokalee ,
Florida, areas. GEORGE LANE stated he has brought the above
information to the attention of DeSoto County Sheriff
FRANK CLINE, Arcadia, Florida.

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that during
their meeting with MARK LANE and CAROLYN MUGAR, they j
received the very definite impression that MARK LANE and~
MUGAR are romantically involved, although MUGAR appears
much younger than MARK LANE. MUGAR appears to be a "wild,
"hippie'’’ type, and during conversation she indicated that
she assists MARK LANE as a photographer.

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that besides the
interest which MARK LANE and MUGAR evidenced in the
RICHARDSON case, they also appeared very interested in any
trouble spots in Florida, such as Negro unrest and
mistreatment of Indians.

On October 29, 1969, a confidential source abroad
advised that during the month of October, 1969, an organization
known as the "English Language Committee" was created in Paris,
France, with the objective of opposing the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, as well as the following additional !
objectives: is} : ‘

1) Opposition to nuclear armament;
2) Opposition to American imperialism; (s
3) Action in favor of recognizing Communist China

4) Activity against racism in the United States

and throughout the world. (8)

MARK LANE, a’ lawyer and American writer( s) 8B)

‘Pinoener Government agency which =>
conducts investigations< abroad advised that’ on
November 14, 1969, MARK LANE was ‘the main speaker at a
teach~in against the war in Vietnam held at the University
of Munich, Munich, Germany. This meeting was attended by
400-600 individuals, and in his speech LANE likened the
atrocities of the Nazis at Dachau, which he had visited, to.
those allegedly committed in Vietnam by American soldiers
and South Vietnamese supported by American soldiers. LANE
played a tape-recorded interview with an American deserter,
the grandson of General JOSEPH STILWELL. LANE also
discussed alleged resistance within the U. S. Army to the
war in Vietnam, claiming that the "brass" was going to
extremes to stifle dissent. LANE asked his German audience
to assist these soldiers who want to desert or fight the
Army "brass" from within. Finally, he declared that he was
returning to the United States. within a month, although he
feared we 5) prosecution for providing assistance to

deserters.

On December 3, 1969, a second confidertkl source

abroad furnished the following information concerning

MARK LANE:(S)

The. Communist-front organization "International

in Budapest during the period March 30-April 3, 1964,
attended inter alia by a delegation from the Danish Section
of the IADL.) One of the delegates was a Copenhageh lawyer

panbtinamed JORG JJACOBSEN, who, prior to the Congress, had
é collected some material concerning the assassination of

we
pens

President KENNEDY. This material was to be used for a

draft resolution to the effect that the Congress was tc
advocate unbiased inguiries into the circumstances surroun-
ding the assassination and the sequel to it. (s)

“Association of Democratic Lawyers” (IADL) held its Sth Congress

DocId:32312111 Page 6



oy

NO 100-17689 - nmb

At the Congress, JORGEN JACOBSEN met the American
lawyer MARK LANE, who in his capacity of chairman of the
"Citizens' Committee of Inquiry" was working on an
independent inquiry into the murder, having no confidence in
the material prepared by the Dallas Police.€$ )

Between JORCEN JACOBSEN and MARK LANE cooperation
was. established on this draft resolution, which, incidentally,
was adopted by the Congress. This cooperation was developed
further, and led to the establishment in Denmark of a so-
called "Mark Lane Committee" for the purpose of collecting
all available information on the assassination of the
President and informing the public of any hushed-up or
suppressed details concerning the murder. §

Following the Congress, however, MARK LANE himself
went to Denmark, where, in the "Lawyers! Debating Club,"
the "Students' Association" in Copenhagen, and the "Students'
Society" in Arhus, he told about his inguiries so far, aiming
at proving that reactionary, fascist circles were behind the
assassination of President KENNEDY .($") :

The Danish "Mark Lane Committee," which may be
considered as long since dissolved, comprised a total of 16
indwviduals; the founder, JORGEN JACOBSEN, is known as a’
Communist, whereas the others mainly belonged to cultural,
left-wing literary circles. However, the activities of the
Committee, mainly based on MARK LANE's inquiries in the
United States, failed to bring forth any sensational
disclosures. The work of the American authorities on the
case was, on the other hand, criticized and the port of
the Warren Commission was denounced as a fraud. ($3

In connecti:n with the references of the Danish
press to this matter, in November, 1964, the "Berlingske
Tidende" published an article, the contents of which MARK LANE
considered defamatory. The result was a libel action against
the newspaper, and on November 11, 1965, the High Court found
the statements of the paper ill-founded. The responsible(¢)

editor was sentenced to pay 2500 D.kr. costs, whereas a E
claim for damages to the amount of no less that 5000 Dkr.

was rejected. In this case JORGEN JACOBSEN acted as counsel
for MARK LANE. (.$) :

In 1966, MARK LANE, who in the meantime had
married a Dane and temporarily settled in Denmark, published
a book entitled Rush to Judgment, the substance of which is
that the murder of the President was not the work of a single
individual, but a conspiracy. Based on this book, a
documentary film was subsequently produced. Moreover, in
the course of the years since the assassination, MARK LANE
gave a great number of lectures about his inquiries and his
opinion of the events in Dallas on November 22, 1963, (s)

MARK LANE, who is currently residing in the
United Stats, does not appear to have attracted notice in
connection with the activities displayed in Denmark .to
assist American deserters, and so far, no connection was {
noted between him and Danish deserters? committees. In aa
July, 1968, however; an IADL meeting took place in Grenoble, -
France; an item on the agenda of this meeting concerned the ”
legal basis of refusing to take Part in wars of aggression.
