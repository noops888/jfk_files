CEORGE LANE stated that it was his distinct

impression from his contact with MARK LANE that MARK LANE

is an agitator who is interested in stirring up racial

disturbances, particularly in the Arcadia and Imnokalee,

Florida, areas. GEORGE LANE stated he has brought the above

information to the attention of DeSoto County Sheriff

FRANK CLINE, Arcadia, Florida.

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that during

their meeting with MARK LANE and CAROLYN MUGAR, they

received the very definite impression that MARK LANE and

MUCAR are romantically involved, although MUGAR appears

much younger than MARK LANE. MUGAR appears to be a "wild,

'hippie'". type, and during conversation she indicated that

she assists MARK LANE as a photographer.

GEORGE and VIRGINIA LANE advised that besides the

interest which MARK LANE and MUGAR evidenced in the

RICHARDSON case, they also appeared very interested in any

trouble spots in Florida, such as Negro unrest and

mistreatment of Indians.

At the Congress, JORGEN JACOBSEN met the American

lawyer MARK LANE, who in his capacity of chairman of the

"Citizens' Committee of Inquiry" was working on an

independent inquiry into the murder, having no confidence in

the material prepared by the Dallas

Police. (5)

Between JORGEN JACOBSEN and MARK LANE cooperation

was. established on this draft resolution, which, incidentally,

was adopted by the Congress.

This cooperation was developed

further, and led to the establishment in Denmark of a so-

called "Mark Lane Committee" for the purpose of collecting

371

available information on the assassination of the

President and informing the public of any hushed-up or

suppressed details concerning the murder. (S)

Following the Congress, however, MARK LANE himself

went to Denmark, where, in the "Lawyers'

Debating Club,"

the "Students'

Association" in Copenhagen, and the "Students'

Soriety" in Arhus, he told about his inquiries so far, aiming

at proving

that reactionary, fascist circles were behind

assassination of President KENNEDY. (S)

The Danish "Mark Lane Committee," which may be

considered as long since dissolved, comprised a total of 16

individuals; the founder, JORGEN JACOBSEN, is known as a

Communist,

whereas the others mainly belonged to cultural,

left-wing literary circles.

Towever, the activitles of the

Committee, mainly based on MARK LANE's inquiries in the

United States, failed to bring forth any sensational

disclosures.

The work of the American authorities on the

ase was, on the other hand, criticized and the

the harren commiscion vas denounced as a fraud. (Se of

press to this matter, in November, 1964, the "Berlingske

claim for damages to the amount of no less that 5000 D.kr.

this case JORGEN JACOBSEN acted as counsel

fOr MARK LANE. (5)

In 1966, MARK LANE, who in the meantime had

married a Dane and temporarily settled in Denmark, published

a book entitled Rush to Judgment, the substance of which is

United States, does not appear to have attracted notice in

connection with the activities displayed in Denmark to

assist American deserters, and so far, no connection was

noted between him and Danish deserters! committees.

July, 1968, however, an IADL meeting took place in Grenoble,..

France; an item on the agenda of this meeting concerned the

legal basis of refusing to take part in wars of aggression.

The identities of the participants of this meeting are not

that the two former IADI delegates are personally acquainted

ard associated with this Communist front organization seems

te indicate that, some time or other, the idea arose between

them to bring American deserters to Denmark in order to

confront the authorities of a NATO country with a congre

headquarters and then to the Staff Judge Advocate General where

a meeting with the Base Commander determined that LANE could

not distribute the

"Helping Hand" on the Air Force Base and

requested that he retrieve those already distributed.

On JULy 19, 1971,.

MARK LANE did not return to the

Mountain Home Air Force Base and no issues of the

"Helping Hand"

were distributed on the base.

The July 14, 1971 issue of the

"Idaho Daily Statesnan," Boise, Idaho, quoted Wing Commander

Colonel HENRY L. WARREN, Mountain Home. Air Force Bage as

refusing permission te distribute the "Helping Hand" because

it advocated resistance to authority and, therefore, was

danger to discipline, loyalty, and morale, a violation of Air

force regulations.

At approximately 6:00 a.m., August 7, 1971, 51 marchers

including 34 GIs and women Air lorce service ladies

from the

Mountain Home Air

Force Base, Mountain Home, Idaho,

began a

march of approximately

10 miles across the desert to Boise,

Idaho.

The march was led by MARK LAND and

the marchers arrived

in Boise, Idaho, at 11:00 a.m. on August 8, 1971 where they

attended a church service at Emanuel Methodist Church, Poise:

Ioaho..

At 12:00 noon, on

the same date, approximately 30 of

the

marchers then

assembled at the world headquarters of the

Morrison Knudsen Construction Company bulling,

400 Broadway

Idahe, where about 100 spectators and marchers

heard LARRIMKNUDSEN; adopted grand-son of the founder of the

company, make a speech on the desire for peace.

The marchers

then raised three home-made flags bearing the words "Bring

'Em

Home" on the Morrison-Knudsen flagpoles at that site.

A third confidential source abroad advised that MARK

LANE of New York City was

in Paris, France, during the period

from March ? to March 24, 1971. During his visit, LANS made

a number

of contacts with Vietnamese revolutionary organizations

SPRTAP/TAC:

On August 23, 1971, another Government agency which

conducts investigations abroad furnished the following

information:

11-25-851

(mc1v949)

During the

summer of 1971, MARK LANE visited Paris,

France, while on his way to Italy.

LANE was believed to be en

route

to Bologna, Italy, to attend the national conference of

Lotta Continua, an Italian Marxist-Leninist group, which was

scheduled for July 24-25, 1971.(R) (4)

The

source stated that LAND

currently heads

"Helping Hand," a

servicemen's underground newspaper in Utah

which is directed

toward personnel of an Air Force base in

that state.

LANE indicated that he is very encouraged by the

response

"Helping Hanu" has received, and stated that he hoped

to convince the servicemen on the base to sabotage their work,

which, according to LANE, is very specialized and consists in

part of helping lay out homb runs in South Vietnam.

As an

example of a

bomb

method of sabotage, LANE proposed altering the

run layouts by placing pencil marks slightly off

their

correct positions. (5X)(U)
