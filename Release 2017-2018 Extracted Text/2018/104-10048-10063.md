MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : John H. Waller
Inspector General
SUBJECT : Jack Anderson Reference to 28 November

1963 CIA Cable

1. The Operations Group of CI Staff has provided a copy
of the cable about which you inquired. A copy is attached at
Tab A. It is a dissemination of a report by a British journalist
stating that a man named Ruby was in Cuba in 1959, where he
visited an American gangster-gambler named "Santos, "' who
was living luxurously in jail. This dissemination was based
on a 27 November 1963 cable from London, a copy of which is
attached at Tab B. A follow-up cable from London on
29 November commented on the source of the story, raising
a question as to his reliability. A copy is at Tab C. A more
detailed statement about the man is contained in a report
passed to the FBI on 12 December 1963, a copy of which is
at Tab D. :

2. On7 January 1964 the FBI provided CIA with a report
that Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in 1959; a copy is at Tab E,
On 30 January CIA provided additional information to the
Bureau on this subject; a copy is at lab F.

3. The following points of coincidence are probably of
interest to Senator Baker: Jack Ruby did travel to Cuba in
1959, as stated in the report that gave. rise to the present
query; the name ''Santos'' is also the given name of Trafficante,
although it is not clear that these are the same persons. While
there are reservations about the reliability of the source of
the report which gave rise to the present question, we are not
in a position at this time to evaluate it definitively. It is noted
that the description of Santos" as living in luxury in a Cuban
prison is similar to a version also reported in a 16 May 1974
story in the Outlook Section of the Washington Post.

4, As you may know, an Agency task force has been
conducting an in-depth study of all information relating to
issues surrounding the Agency's support for the Warren
Commission investigation. This study has been underway
since early July and, because of the detailed nature of the
review, may require as much as another two months if it
is to be completed with the thoroughness that we believe
necessary.

Reference: OUT 85657, 28 November 1963

if A usually reliable source, whose information was
evaluated as "possibly true", reported on 8 August 1951 the
following information concerning one Carl John WILSON Budsen,

: Be WILSON, a Spanish citizen of Dritish descent
H residing in Chile, was 2 contact of one Bert SUCHAROY,
a suspected Soviet agent, in Santiago, Chile.

bd It had been ascertained that WILSON had
arrived in Chile on 28 January 1933 from Buenos Aires,
bearing Spanish passport No. 7, issued in Buenos Aires
on 4 January 1539 and visaed (tourist) by the Chilean
Coasul in that city on 25 January 1939. He held
Chilean carnet 1,824,595 (Santiago) and resided at
Calle Arturo iiedina 4207, Santiago.

Ce Further background data vevealed that WILSON
was born in Liverpool, England, on 29 Gecember 1915,
In July 1936 he had left his studies at Oxford Univere
sity in England to enlist as a volunteer in the Spanish
fa Loyalist Forces, whereupon he acquired his Spanish
citizenship.

ae Subsequent to his arrival in Chile, WILSON in
his capacity as a jarnalist had opened a one-man crusade
against the British Government, in violation of restrice
tions placed on such activities by foreigners in Chile,
He nag been, in addition, masquerading under various
nonexistent titlos as a result of which the Chilean

had frequently posed as a Dritish RAF captain and had
worn the corresponding uniform,

ze The strange mannerisms exhibited by WILSON
were attributed to a mental iliness, and zollowing
WILSON's second outburst, the British Ambassador pre-
sented another request for his expulsion. Agnin,
however, following various explanations by WILSOR to
the British Embassy and on the renewat of his promise
to refrain from further ectivities of a similar nature, |
tae case was dropped.

2, On J October 1952, a usually reliable sourse, whose
information was evaluated as "possibly true," submitted the
following report concerning one Carlos John WILSON, who is
identifiable with tne Carl John WILSON Eudson ia paragraph
1 above,

in 1947 and had worked on @ special mission for the
British Government in Germany, Egypt, and Turkey at
the close or World War Il. He stated that he had
fought with the Spanish Republican forces against Franco,
He was violently anti-United States and constantly
condemned United States policy. WILSON was of the
opinion that England uad france would eventually join.
with the USSR to form 2 pact aimed at the complete
destruction of the United States. He claimed to be an
authority on the Balkans, and was a strong supporter
of Tito. Tito, WILSON stated, would eventually line up
the entire Balkan area with England and Erance to assist
Russia in crushing the United States.

inter become a colonel in the Nicaraguan Army but had

% patriots were fighting for their sacred rights to be tree
sitizers and that American volunteers were helping the dic-
tators with the approval of Washington, ‘ocurce commented that
WILSON was planning on accompanying Mario CALERO, Nicaraguan
revolutionary who was readying an expedition against

7. Associated Presa datelined 6 July 1959, davana,

day hunger strike to protest his arrest and had to be fed
intravenously at Cuba's Mational Police Hospital. Although

was here a little leas than a year ago visiting a lir. Pranski,
owner of a shop dealing in tourist articles, located on
Prado Street between Animas and Trocadero, opposite the
Sevilla Biltmore." The reference to Rubinstein appears to
refer to Jack L. Ruby who is presently in custody, Dallas,
Texas, on charges of shooting Lee Harvey Oswald.

For your information this Bureau's investigation
concerning Jack L, Ruby has developed no information that
Ruby has ever been in Cuba except on one occasion in 1959

himself readily admits to this trip but has denied any other
trips to Cuba or contacts with persons there.

allegation that Jack L, Ruby has possibly visited Cuba since
