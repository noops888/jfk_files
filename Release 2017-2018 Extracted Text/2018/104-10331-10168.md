(AIUO) Bulletin OIM EB No. 02-98.

dated 22 July 1998

1.

(U) The JFK Board has made a number of recent

specific directed requests to assure that the Agency has

complied fully with the requirements of the JFK Act. Among

these was a request for issuance of the Reference Employee

Bulletin, In which the DaI directed that employees leave "no

stone unturned" in assuring that relevant documents are

provided to the commission.

2. (U). In part because relevant new documents have

surfaced within the past few months, the Board has also

requested specific focus on renewed searches of the Agency's

"counterintelligence files." The new documents have

surfaced due to a variety of reasons, including references

to assassination related personalities in recent defector

reports, records made available 'because of the break up of

the Soviet Union, and advances in search capabilities due to

digitization of

older paper files.
