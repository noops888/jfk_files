d.

The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of

Intelligence - DGI) overseas field-station chief has no respon

sibility for physical or other security of the Cuban Embassy or

Mission, nor does any member of his staff.

The DGI would not use a regular foreign-service officer in the

field because he has not been cleared and briefed and is not,

therefore, considered qualified for intelligence tasks.

foreign-service officer is briefed, it may be assumed that he

has been cleared and that he is thereafter considered a member

of the DGI (at least by the DaI) .

On returning to Havana per

manently, such a foreign-service officer briefed for a field

assignment normally would be sent to DGI Headquarters rather

than to the Nints. y of Foreign Relations.
