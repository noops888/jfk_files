largest faction and had organized delegations in Miami, New

York, Chicago, Venezuela and Cuba. (Ibid) The clandestine

faction operating in Cuba was lead by Pepin Fernandez Badue

who used

the alias "Lucas". (Ibid)

When Fernandez arrived in

the U.S. in October 1961, he presented his credentials to the

Cuban

Revolutionary Council (CRC), claiming he was the rep-

resentative of the MDC movement in Cuba, and Council president,

DI. Miro Cardona, accepted him into the CRC. (Ibid) The

"Lucas" faction remained with the council but declined in

importance because Fernandez failed to consult with the

Executive Committee of his faciton nor did he make any effort

to hold the group together. (HSCA Security File 092, Senstudy

Document, Volume 32, Item 1, #97-4110-72)

The Rasco faction of MDC had as it Military Chief an

independently wealthy young Cuban, Laureano Batista Falla.

(Ibid, Item 2: #97-4110-123) Free-spirited and under no financiall

pressures, Batista was able to organize

and partially finance the

infiltration attempts of the MDC (HSCA #009303, FBI #97-4623-149,

Section V) which made this one of the most active and effective

underground groups in Cuba during the early 1960's. (HSAC

However,

the repressive measures of the Castro regime after the

invasion caused members of the Cuban undergound to live in

fear of discovery and made intergroup liaison extremely

risky.

the inherent dangers, the underground

It

was

the year 1963, however, that found the Batista

faction of the MDC involved in a large number of anti-Castro

activities.

The MDC made

a unity pact with the Commandos I in which

the latter

group was to provide training and

assistance in

military intelligence and the MDC was to provide 3 small boats

and a team of men to infiltrate Cuba. The MDC also made a

pact with De. Carlos Prio Socarras, former Presplient of Cuba

who donated $50,000 to the group for military aid in return

for its promise of political support. (CIA/DDO, MDC Volume 5,

Information Cable UFG-3536, 9/3/63)

In April 1963, Frank Sturgis, Miami-based soldier of

fortune, supplied information that Batista, Orlando Bosch Avila,

Manuel Artime and Alexander Rorke were jointly planning an air

strike over Havana on April 25. (HSCA #009303, page 1, FBI #97-4623,

Section I) According to Sturgis, the strike was to originate from

Alexander Rorke publically announced the strike had taken

and they dismissed it

fads nocessary to implement their plan. (Ibid) This incident

created a

stir and

resulted in an intensive FBI investigation

of Rorke's allegation. (HSCA #009303, p. 3, FBI # 97-4623,

Richard Rudolph Davis, A Cuban älien, WIKK/A/ApeFÄKEN

рФКФ/ (HSCA 012981) had a peripheral association with the

MDC through his contact with Batista in the summer of 1963.

(Ibid) Davis was residing in New Orleans and, although not

at an earlier time

an MDC member, claimed/to have been a "coordinator" for the

group

and the New York Police Deparmtent. (Ibid)

He was

a friend

of Batista

and contacted

him because he knew Batista

was

in

position

to recommend

men

in the Miami

area who

needed work. (Ibid) Davis claimed he could provide employ-

ment for a small group of Cuban emigres.

Davis had entered into a business deal with geologist

David L. Raggio and a wealthy, right-wing New Orelanian, Gus

de LaBarre, forming the Guatemalad Lumber and Mineral Corpora-

tion. (Ibid) It was their intention to train the Cubans on

some land in Lacombe, Louisiana to which de LaBarre had access

through his nephew, Frank de LaBarre. (Ibid) After the train-

ing period, they were to be sent to Guatemala to cut mahogany.

A group of about 18 Cubans did arrive, under the leader-

ship of a well-known Cuban exile, Victor Paneque (Ibid), who

According to Davis, the men arrived dressed in khakis (HSCA 006716,

Report from

New Orleans, 7/3/64)

In the latter part of July 1963, the FBI conducted a

raid on property near that of the lumber company training camp,

where they seized

a cache of dynamite and other explosives.

(Ibid). This raid, according to Davis, unnerved his trainees,

and they elected to return to Miami. (Ibid)

A somewhat different version of this episode comes

from Gus de LaBarre's nephew and attorney, Frank, who first

related his story in 1966 to his former law school classmate,

Jim Garrison.

(HSCA 012981, Fonzi memo 9/6/78)

de LaBarre

said his Uncle Gus had introduced him to

Davis, whom deLaBarre described as a "floater". They came to

see de LaBarre about

drawing up Articles of Incorporation for

the Guatemalan Lumber Company and that is when he learned of

their plans to bring unemployed Cubans from Miami to train as

loggers. Uncle Gus sent provisions to the exiles on a daily

basis and solicited money for food and clothing from friends

and relatives.

de LaBarre said he didn't pay much attention to the

activities of the group but, when he heard on his car radio that

the FBI had seized a cache of ammunition at a house in Lacombe,.

he immediately called his uncle. Although receiving assurances

that the lumber group was not involved, de LaBarre called the

officers of the corporation together and insisted that the

Cubans be taken out of

there. Davis claimed, according to

de LaBarre's version, that the Cubans did not want to leave,

whereupon

de LaBarre had to some some real "brainstorming'.

He rented

a Hertz

ton-and-a-half truck

and instructed Davis to

take it to the camp and tell the Cubans "that the invasion

is

on."

Davis complied, and the Cubans loaded their gear, jumped

in the truck and

were brought to the Greyhound bus terminal

in New Orleans. Each Cuban was given a one-way ticket to Miami

plus a small

amount of cash and told they would get their orders

when they reached Miami. Looking as though ready for war, with

knapsacks and

guns bulging from under their

clothes, they

boarded the bus

and de LaBarre had no more contact with them.

The last he heard of Davis was

in 1964 when one of de

LaBarre's

friends reported he had gone into business with Davis and

was

left with a lot

of bills. (Ibid) :
