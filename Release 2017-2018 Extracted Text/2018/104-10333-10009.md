Dear Ms. Goodpasture:

This is to confirm our two recent phone conversations
concerning the JFK assassination records. I am writing
this letter in my capacity as the DCI's liaison with the
Assassination Records Review Board.

The Review Board requests the opportunity to interview
you as part of its mandate to identify information relevant
to President Kennedy's assassination that may be released
to the public. The Board members were appointed by
President Clinton under authorization of the John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.

Mr. Jeremy Gunn, the Board's General Counsel, will contact
you to make arrangements for the interview. You are authorized
to discuss with Board members or staff information pertaining
to the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico
city, and any US Government investigations into either.

The Board members and staff have been cleared for
classified information up to Top Secret, including
compartmented information. They have had complete access to
all pertinent CIA files. Mr. Gunn has an SCI clearance from
the Agency. Therefore, you may answer questions candidly
and completely, including with classified information.
Disclosures to the members and staff of the Board will not
violate your secrecy agreement.

This letter has been prepared in consultation with
CIA's Office of General Counsel. If you have any questions
concerning this letter, please call me on 703-351-2802.

Sincerely,

John F. Pereira

Dear Mr. Horton:

Iam writing to you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an
independent Federal Agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The Review
Board, whose members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is
charged with collecting records related to the assassination of President Kennedy. The
Review Board is not seeking to reach any conclusions regarding the assassination, but is
primarily concerned with identifying, clarifying, locating, and making available
assassination records. I am enclosing some explanatory material about the Review
Board and its mandate.

As part of our mandate, we have been reviewing records that originated with the
Central Intelligence Agency. Several of the records relate to the investigation of Lee
Harvey Oswald’s trip to Mexico City and his alleged association with the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee and anti-Castro organizations. We have some questions about these
subjects as well as a related event that involved James Angleton traveling to Mexico
City in 1971 to acquire Win Scott’s papers. We hope that you may be able to assist us in
determining the existence of various assassination records connected with the events
described above.

We would like to request a meeting to discuss the aforementioned issues. We invite
you to come to our offices in Washington, but we would be more than willing to meet
you at your home or another convenient location. We will be contacting you in the near
future to arrange for a convenient time for you.

Iam writing you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an independent
Federal Agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination

As Michelle Combs mentioned in her telephone call last Tuesday, we would like very
much to discuss your work experiences in Moscow from 1957-1959 with you. We
believe that your past in-depth knowledge of the Moscow Embassy and its procedures
may assist the ARRB in our attempts to clarify the historical record in this area.

Before talking with you, we would like to make certain that you would feel free to
discuss fully all relevant aspects of your work in Moscow. To the extent that you think
that discussion.of your work might possibly involve classified or sensitive matters, we
would like to resolve such concerns in a way that would provide you with whatever
assurance that you need that you would not be improperly divulging classified
information. If you feel discussing this subject with the Review Board would constitute
disclosure of any information that is still classified, we will be happy to initiate a
discussion between you and the appropriate officials to address any concerns you may
~have.

One of the members of our staff, Michelle Combs, will be calling to arrange a mutually
agreeable time and place for an interview. Should you wish to contact us in response to

Russia House has looked at Michelle Combs' memo on her interview of Russell Langelle.
The only areas of concern they had, which they said they could not comment on knowledgeably, are:
+ The mention of George Payne Winters, Jr. They do not know if he is overt.
+ The mention of the HTLINGUAL program in the last paragraph of page two. They are not familiar with this program and don't
know if this program is overt/has been publicly acknowledged by the Agency.

Af you could check into these two matters or tell me where to get the answers, ! would appreciate it. Thanks.

OVERFLYING RUSSIA 153

The next thing we tried was something called a Salisbury
screen, a metallic grid applied to the airplane's undercarriage
in the hope of deflecting incoming radar beams, but it worked .
only at some frequencies and altitudes and not at others.

Kelly thought it was more practical to try special iron fer-
rite paints that would absorb a radar ping rather than
bounce it back to the sender. The paints were moderately ef-
fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's
outer skin and we experienced overheating engine problems.
But the paint lowered the radar cross section by one order of
magnitude, so we decided to give it a try. We called these
specially painted airplanes “dirty birds” and shipped the first
one out for flight testing in April 1957. Our test pilot, Bob
Sieker, took the U-2 up to over seventy thousand feet and
suddenly radioed that he was experiencing rapid airframe
heat buildup. Moments later his engine blew out and the face-
plate blew off Bob's oxygen mask as his pressure suit in-
stantly inflated: The U-2 dove straight down and crashed. It
took us three days to locate the wreckage and Bob's body. An
autopsy revealed that above seventy thousand feet he had
suffered acute hypoxia and lost consciousness in only ten
seconds. The culprit that killed him was a defective faceplate
clasp that cost fifty cents.

The CIA was so desperate to buy time for these Soviet over-
flights that Bissell got Kelly to sequester four of our test flight
engineers and have them write a bogus flight manual for a U-2
twice as heavy as ours and with a maximum altitude of only
fifty thousand feet that carried only scientific weather gear in
its bay. The manual included phony instrument panel photos
with altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor
limits. Four copies were produced and then artificially aged
with grease, coffee stains, and cigarette burns. How or if the
agency got them into Soviet hands only Mr. B knew, and:he
never told.

Subject: Interview with Russell A. Langelle

On August 21, 1997, Russell A. Langelle, senior CIA officer in Moscow from 1957 to
1959 was interviewed by Michelle Combs. The interview was not recorded.

’ Mr. Langelle provided an overview of life in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow from

1957-1959. He outlined his duties and activities as the embassy security officer
and as the senior CIA officer in Moscow during that time period.

Mr. Langelle noted that he had no contact with Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow
and did not remember ever hearing the name until after the assassination of
President Kennedy.

In discussing his duties in Moscow, Mr. Langelle said that he had been sent to

- Moscow specifically to meet with GRU Lieutenant Colonel Pyotr Popov,

recruited in Vienna in 1952, who was then working as an agent-in-place within
the GRU, the Soviet military intelligence service. Langelle explained that
meeting Popov in the Soviet capital was his number one priority and that he was
given instructions not to draw attention to himself in any way which might
endanger Popov.

Mr. Langelle noted that his other responsibilities for CIA included finding,
checking, and locating potential dead drops, and the general assessment of the _
various Soviet officials he met as potential recruitment targets. He emphasized
that his activities on behalf of the CIA were very passive and that none of these
activities was allowed to overshadow the importance of meeting Popov safely.
He made no attempts to recruit any Soviets for fear of calling attention to himself
as a CIA officer and thus endangering Popov.

When asked about other CIA officers in the embassy, Mr. Langelle said that he
had a loose supervisory role over the other officers in the embassy in that he
knew each of them (they did not necessarily know each other as CIA officers)
and generally what they were doing. However, Langelle emphasized that he did
not know the specifics of anyone’s work but his own and that there was no
“station” which functioned as any kind of a unit. The CIA officers in Moscow


13-00000

functioned as individuals, acting on instructions from Headquarters, with no
coordination of their activities in-country.

Mr. Langelle thought that it was likely that George Payne Winters, Jr. had his
own communications channel with Headquarters and that possibly the other
officers did too. He stated that he was never instructed to pass a message from
Headquarters to any other officer and that no officer ever asked him to pass any
information on to Headquarters.

When asked about CIA files, Mr. Langelle noted that the few CIA files that
existed in Moscow were kept in one drawer of his safe and that only he had
access to them. No one else had the combination. He said that to the best of his
recollection, the files consisted mainly of communications materials.such as one-
time-pads, a few records of dead drop locations, and communications protocol.

Mr. Langelle explained that tourists and defectors were never part of his
responsibilities in Moscow either as the embassy security officer or as a CIA
officer. He said that he had no contact with any of the American defectors. Mr.
Langelle explained that any potential counterintelligence risk from an American
defector would not have been viewed as important enough to expose Langelle’s
presence as a CIA officer.

Asked about the CIA’s legal traveller program, Mr. Langelle said that he knew
about the existence of the program but that he had no contact with any of its
participants. He thought it possible that George Payne Winters, Jr. had some
contact or role in the program because he had many contacts in the Russian
community. Mr. Langelle emphasized that he had no specific knowledge
whether Winters did have a role in the legal traveller program.

Mr. Langelle thought that it was possible that the military attaches would have
met with any defector. with a military background, but that he did not know if
any of the attaches had met with any of the defectors. He also thought it was
possible that an attache could have taken Oswald to the upper (restricted) floors
for- counseling but again, he did not have any specific knowledge of such an
occasion.

When asked about the HTLINGUAL program, Mr. Langelle said that he knew
about the mail opening program. He noted that he was the only person in the
embassy who knew that American non-diplomatic pouch mail was seen by both ‘
the Soviets, through regular KGB screening, and the CIA through HTLINGUAL.
