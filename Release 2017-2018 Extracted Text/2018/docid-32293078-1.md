GRAZIANO identified this individual as ROBERT WEBSTER and

as a fibre

He said WEBSTER lived at 15321 Welton Drive, East Cleveland,

he is safe and well. According to RAND, the subject should

return to the United States about October 1, 1959, if he

returns at the expiration of his present 20-day tour.

The

subject has in his possession his return air transportation

ticket to the United States.

RAND stated that although the

subject is still on their payroll, upon his return to the

United States he would be terminated.

RAND said that the subject has no knowledge of

RAND's connections with the United States Air Force, and the

subject was not utilized by RAND in any intelligence capacity

whatsoever.

at 15321 Welton Drive.

No employment is listed in this

directory. On the basis of the information available as set

out above, the Cleveland files reflect no reference identi-

fiable with the subject or MARTHA WEBSTER.

Due to the basis on which GRAZIANO was contacted

and in view of the current connection between the Rand

Development Corporation and the United States Air Force, no

direct questioning concerning the subject was made on inter-

view with RAND and GRAZIANO and information furnished by them

was merely accepted. If any of the information as furnished

by RAND and GRAZIANO is disseminated outside the FBI, their

The Cleveland

Division feels that further investigation of the subject is

warranted; however, no specific recommendations are being made

scope of investigation desired.

Fair and due to the connection between the Rand Company and
