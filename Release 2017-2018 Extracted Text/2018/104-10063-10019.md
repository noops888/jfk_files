basically in the North Anerican black movement.

Party has recently organized a young Communist movement..:

(Comment: This is probably the Young Workers Liberation

League.): The CPUSA participates heavily in the labor

movement. At a recent (unnamed) labor meeting of repre-

sentatives from various regions of the United States, the

CPUSA had direct influence in 26 of the 50 unions repre-

sented.

The magazine Labor Party plays an important role

in coordinating movements within the labor ranks.

numerous barriers (sic), the CPUSA is concentrating its

efforts in Chicago, Los

other regions of importance.

The CPUSA has recently

adopted a common strategy towards the peace movement.

skyites cause problems, but they appear to have abated
