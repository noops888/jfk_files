18 December 1963

BACKGROUND

@peration ANTRUNK III/IV which was mounted in August 1963 was

iccessful in that the two principals of the team, AMICE-27

pacientes and AMICE-14, were able to contact aod to recruit two princi+
nad Pal agents and several other action agents to lay the ground-
work fo> the MHAPRON objectives of the ANTRUNK Operation. One
of the two internal P/A's, AMTRUNK~9, vas oxfiltrated with the
four-man AXTRUNK infiltration seam for training and operatioza:
* discussions in the JMWAVE area. In early September, ANTRUNK-9
was re-infiltrated into PBRUMEN in Operation AMTRUNK Vv, the
: - Same operation which exfiltrated AMFAUNAS <1, -3, -13 and -34.
+ In late October AMICE-27 was separated from the clandestine
Part of the AMTRUNK operation. The original objectives of
Operation AMTRUNK VI, postponed from December 1963 to January
1964, were to revitalize and re-direct the efforta of the two

internal P/A's toward their primary task, i.e. to spot and re-
- eruit among high level figures who are dissatisfied with the
Castro regime. In late December, the scope of this mission was
altered by the receipt of a commercial telegram in open code
from AMTRUNK-9 indicating that he wae in grave danger and wished
to be exfiltrated. The twin objectives of Operation AMTRUNK VI
then becane: first, to exfiltrate AMTRUNK-9 and, this accom
“plished, for AMICE-14 to Proceed to Havana for his task of re=
channelling ANTRUNK-10's responsibilities. The exfiltration of

UNK-9, who brought with him his entire family consisting of

wite, brother-in-law, and three small children, was accomplished
- 0n 9 January 1964. The unexpected presence of AMTRUNE-9's
family, couple? with reports of increased vigilance in the infil-
tration area, forced AMICE-14 to extiltrate the same night with-
, ut attempting to accomplish the second part of his mission.
