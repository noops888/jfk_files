- EVIDENCE, THE FACTS OF THE CASE, AND THE NECESSARY PROOF,

AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, WHEN THE EXTENT AND
SERIOUSNESS OF THE STEPS TAKEN BY CUBELA WERE STILL UNKNOWN-~
ALTHOUGH THERE WERE STRONG INDICATIONS THAT A CRIMINAL AND TREACHER-
OUS PLAN WAS BEING PREPARED E AGAINST HIS PERSON--COMRADE FIDEL -
CASTRO SUMMONED CUBELA. HE SPOKE TO HIM FOR SEVERAL HOURS, AND
URGED HIM NOT TO BE CONVERTED INTO AN INSTRUMENT OF THE ENEMIES or
THE REVOLUTION AND THE COUNTRY. FIDEL ALSO TOLD CUBELA THAT BECAUSE
OF CUBELA'S UNSTABLE CHARACTER, HIS FONDNESS FOR AN EASY LIFE, AND
HIS LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE PROBLEMS AND THE STRUGGLES OF THE
PEOPLE, CUBELA ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS INCREASING ISOLATION
OUTSIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS. BUT, FIDEL TOLD RIM, IF HE
REALLY WOULD CORRECT THIS AND WAS READY TO DEVOTE HIMSELF
SERIOUSLY 0 ANY ACTIVITY IN THE MANY FIELDS IN WHICH THE REVOLU-
TION PURSUES ITS WORK, WE WOULD ALL BE READY TO HELP HIM. :

WHEN THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE, IT WAS NOT KNOWN THAT
MONTHS AGO CUBELA HAD MADE A PACT WITH MANUEL ARTIME, & NO LESS,

_ IN A MADRID APARTMENT TO ASSASSINATE THE MAN WHO WAS TALKING TO HIM
"IN THIS WAY, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS ALREADY TOO COMMITTED 10

THE ENEMY TO TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY OFFERED HIM.
